APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLIGHTLY. THIS OBSERVATION WAS MADE WHILE TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH IN THE AUTOMOBILE. MRS. [REDACTED] WATCHED THE OBJECT UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE APPROACHED OREANA, ILLINOIS, AT WHICH TIME THE OBJECT FADED OUT AND DISAPPEARED.

ON THE SAME NIGHT AT W1432, 27 JULY 1960, I WAS DRIVING HOME ON CHANUTE AFB, ILLINOIS, WHEN ONE OF MY CHILDREN ASK ME WHAT THE BRIGHT OBJECT WAS IN THE SKY. I LOOKED DUE WEST AND OBSERVED THE MOON THROUGH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HAZE LAYER. IT WAS ABOUT 1/4 FULL AND CAST A BRILLIANT ORANGE GLOW IN THE THE SKY. THE EXACT OUTLINE WAS NOT DISCERNIBLE BECAUSE OF THE HAZE, BUT A BRILLIANT, CRESCENT SHAPE GLOW MADE AN UNUSUAL APPEARANCE. THE MOON WAS 1/4 FULL ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION AND MOONSET WAS AT 01452. I QUESTIONED SEVERAL SERVICE STATION ATTENDANTS ON HIGHWAY 47 BETWEEN OREANA AND CISCO, ILLINOIS. NO ONE QUESTIONED OBSERVED ANY UNUSUAL OBJECT IN THE SKY ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION. I AM CONVINCED THAT MRS. [REDACTED] WAS OBSERVING THE 1/4 MOON THROUGH EITHER A HAZE LAYER OR A FLEECY CLOUD. ATTACHMENT ONE.

IMATELY 2 TO 3 HOURS AND UP TO 50,000 OR 70,000 FT. THIS WOULD
MERIT FURTHER INVESTIGATION IF THE OBJECT WAS NEARLY STATIONARY.
