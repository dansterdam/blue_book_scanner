The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed "UFO Analysis Sheet" documenting an observation of unidentified aerial objects near Mineral Wells, Texas on July 13, 1960.

OCR text:

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location 3 mi S. of Mineral Wells, Texas
Date 13 July 1960 Hour (Z) 0730Z
WX partly cloudy, winds 170 deg at 11 knots
Description Found, size of self-luminous lights, two lights, one black to dark red, two lights, first seen 30 deg elev in SW, last seen 30 deg elev in W, two objects are maneuverers, disappear behind clouds, seen for 5 minutes
Direction of Motion North
Satellite: (AFGIN-4F3, Phone 69219) In sight, too long to be a satellite
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Duration excessive for a meteor, speed too fast for Planet
Radar Analysis (ARCIN-4EI) None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) ______
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. None seen
Other Insuff data - 1 witness
Evaluation of Source Reliability Prob reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The course of the object was consistent with the characteristics of a "balloon." Ball lightning was also considered due to the "ball-on-a-wire" type of motion, however, they were able to exclude this as an explanation. It was concluded in this case that the objects were probably balloons. However, in this time span, balloons would have been at an altitude of about 60,000 ft, there were no reports of any balloons being released from that location, and the size, color, and motion of the objects were not typical of balloons.
