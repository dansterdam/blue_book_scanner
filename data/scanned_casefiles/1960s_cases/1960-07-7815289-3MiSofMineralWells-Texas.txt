UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location 3 mi S. of Mineral Wells, Texas

Date 18 July 1960     Hour (2) 0730Z

WX Partly cloudy, winds 170 deg at 4 knots

Description Found, size of half-to-solar, intense white to dark red, Two objects, first seen 30 deg elev * in SW, last seen 30 deg elev in west, *X moved in arc maneuvers, disapp behind clouds, seen for 5 minutes

Direction of Motion North

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219)     In sight too long to be a satellite

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Duration excessive for a meteor, speed too fast for planet

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1)     None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)     --------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.     Poss acft

Other     Insuff data - 1 witness

Evaluation of Source Reliability Prob reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: The source of the object was consistent with the wind direction, suggesting the possibility of a balloon. Balloon are released from locations S,F,N of sources location. However, they were scattered to be released one hour prior to its sighting, and in this time the balloons would have been at about 60,000 ft altitude. Therefore it will not have been seen. There are a great many airports in this part of the state, and it is possible that the objects were not from one of these airports. Due to there being only one witness, this report is classified as insuff data.
