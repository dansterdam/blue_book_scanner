11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a stationary and a moving object in the southern sky. The object was spherical in shape and the colors noted were changing from red-green-white. Personnel on duty noted a change of color and intensity. Two F-106s were airborne from Galena AFS at 16282Z. They searched the area for 70 minutes with negative results.
The description of the stationary object is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. The moving light could be a satellite.

Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear Sir: Three months ago when I was stationed at Galena AFS, Alaska, I observed a very strange object that glowed with a reddish color. This object was about 40 degrees above the western horizon. I observed the object for about 20 seconds and then it went down behind a row of trees by my house. The next day I went to the area where I had observed the object and there was no physical evidence that could be observed. The time I saw this object the sky was clear of all clouds. The time was about seven p.m.

On the sky, the object seemed to go forward then backward and then straight down. If possible, I would like to get a picture of where the object hovered. Could you please send me some information on what to do and if I see this object again.

Dear Miss ***,

Reference your letter of August 22, 1966, concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object on October 15, 1966. Your report has been reviewed and a conclusive explanation due to the date of your sighting.

Sightings such as yours are extremely difficult to trace since there is much a time lapse involved - space reports several months old are somewhat difficult to analyze.

We regret the unfortunate circumstance that arose, causing such a delay in reporting your observation. Your report will be kept on file to aid our analysis in their investigations.

If in the future you observe another unidentified object, suggest you place a collect telephone call to the nearest Air Force Base. They in turn will do a prompt investigation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. For your information we are including the brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects.

a. Dear ___,

Reference your letter of 5 August 1966 concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object on 16 October 1966. Your report has been studied by our analysts and they are unable to reach a conclusive explanation due to the date of your sighting. Sightings such as yours are extremely difficult to trace since there is such a time lapse involved. Even reports several months old are sometimes difficult to analyze.

I regret the unfortunate circumstances that arose, causing such a delay in reporting your observation. Your report will be kept on file to aid in their future investigations.

If in the future you observe another unidentified object, I suggest you place a collect telephone call to the nearest Air Force Base. They in turn will do a prompt investigation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. For your information, your report helps provide the background on Project Blue Book, which describes the resolution of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

Attention Project Blue Book
Gentlemen:
Reference is made to the glowing object sighted over Long Island on October 29th. I am a pilot and was enroute from Shannon, Ireland to New York International Airport. Perhaps this may interest you.
At approximately 2100Z,making good about 240 deg. True,at an altitude of 31,000 ft.we sighted an orange-colored glowing object about 20 deg.to our left. Visibility was good with sky conditions broken to scattered above and no undercast. It appeared to be far on the horizon and our intention was to continue on our course until the object came abeam of us which time we could investigate. However, at our speed of about 450 knots, as we continued to watch,it never did come abeam nor did its apparent motion relative to us diminish nor did it change its size position. At one time it disappeared,and at our navigation computation approach,there could have been eclipse or obscuration the glow seemed to break up into two parts. There was no definite shape to the glow and it was about the size of a star-diameter. It observed it for about 30 minutes at an altitude of 31,500 ft.
The above figures are approximate as I remember them; they were noted more accurately on my chart which has been filed with our operations office in Miami.If you desire more exact data,I can obtain it from the chart.
There were three other crew members besides myself that observed the glow and it was our final deduction that it was a reflected image of the moon,or of the actual sunset,due to refraction.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter responding to an earlier letter regarding a reported sighting of a glowing object over Long Island on October 22, 1966. The text of the letter is as follows:

Proposed reply to a letter from [redacted] 29 Oct 66
Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of October 29, 1966 regarding a glowing object sighted over Long Island on October 22 is appreciated. It is most helpful in our evaluations when persons, such as yourself, report an unusual observation and offer a possible explanation to its cause or causes.

There have been several alleged UFO sightings in the Long Island area of late. We do have one observation, which occurred on October 22 at 2000 hours, local time, which does fit the description you provided. Other similar observations have been reported of a star-like object observed in the western sky. However, we feel that the star Arcturus is responsible for these sightings.

Did you and the other crew members observe a very bright star in addition to your reported observation? Arcturus would have been setting on an azimuth of 200 degrees at 2000 hours EDT.

If you can remember the exact data on your sighting and if your crew did observe Arcturus in addition to the unidentified it would be most helpful.

Thank you for your informative letter and we hope to hear from you soon.

SUMMARY REPORT
UFO investigation of Oct. 29 - Nov. 2, 1966
M. D. Powers, Systems Engineer
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

INTRODUCTION
On October 21, 1966, at about 0100, EDT, policemen at Patchogue, Long Island, sighted an object over the ocean to the southeast. They reported this object as flashing red, green, and blue, and as being extremely bright. The object would occasionally rise and fall, and dart side to side, however, it always returned to the same place. Over a period of hours the object traveled very slowly to the right and up; it was observed by some of the policemen until dawn.

This incident was reported to the Suffolk County Air Force base by the policemen, who called while the event was in progress. The press claiming the story, probably not from all the witnesses, and printed stories about a "hot dog shaped" object hovering near Patchogue. During the following nine days, SCAFD received about 50 reports of UFO's, the local police in various towns receiving several times that number.

On October 29, 1966, we investigators from Project Blue Book arrived at the L.W. Wilkins Manley, and Mr. William Powers, civilian consultants. Lt. Marley is a member of the Blue Book staff at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and is in the field of metallurgy. Mr. Powers is from the Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University, where he is in charge of design and development of electronic-optical systems. Mr. Powers is also familiar with astronomical phenomena and photographic techniques.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, describing the investigation of sightings reported to SCABS (presumably an acronym) during 1966. The document provides details about the classification scheme used for the sightings, as well as descriptions of the observed phenomena, including objects that appeared to flash different colors, move erratically, and maintain a constant motion relative to the stars. The document also mentions that the objects were described as "brighter than a star," "larger than a star," "round," "oval," "long and thin," or "cylindrical," and were much smaller than the moon.

THE INVESTIGATION
The investigators arrived the evening of October 29; they spent that evening and the following morning going through all sightings reported to SCAFB during 1966. A classification scheme was devised to apply to the sightings since October 21, and these sightings were coded as to type, on the basis of descriptions in the reports. It was found that the majority of reports could be described as follows:
TYPE A: Bright object 10 to 30 degrees above the horizon, observed for long periods, usually terminated by the witness' ceasing to watch. The object appeared to flash red, green, blue and white. Occasionally it might rise, move erratically about, or dive, but always stayed near the same average position. This average position would change very slowly over a period of 10 minutes to several hours; some objects would move higher, one would move lower in the sky. Repeated appearances would occur on successive nights. The objects would be described as "brighter than a star," "larger than a star," "round," "oval," "long and thin," or "cylindrical". All, however, were much smaller than the moon. In binoculars the object showed greater color effects, and a spinning or chaotic motion, within itself. 
TYPE B: The objects appeared star-like, sometimes flickering red and green or changing color to dull orange or red near the horizon. It would be in definite, constant motion relative to stars, following a path from north to south or from west to east, or a path between these limits. It would occasionally seem to "zig-zag" or change course, although maintaining the same general direction. Its shape would be described as irregular.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing various types of UFO sightings and their characteristics.

"like a star" or "round" or "too far away to tell." Its height was generally taken to be about that of airliners. Observations lasted 2 to 20 minutes, the object sometimes disappearing while still in the sky.

Type C: The object was white, and sometimes alternating with white, and sometimes with other red, green, or white lights moving together. The course was generally straight, although the object sometimes appeared to change course or come to a stop.

Most (all but about 10) of the incidents fell into these three categories. Type A objects are stars, type B are satellites, and type C are high altitude aircraft. All descriptions which fit the above summaries with no anomalies were taken to be identified.

The aspects of type A sightings which caused the witnesses to report them as UFOs were the changing colors and the erratic motions.

In a few cases the slow drift due to the rising or setting of the object was taken to indicate something out of the ordinary. In other words, many people did not know that stars show color scintillations when near the horizon, and were not aware that prolonged fixation on an isolated object will result in apparent motions due to the natural shifting of the eyes, and did not know that stars rise and set. All these effects were attributed to the object itself.

Type B sightings gave rise to UFO reports partly, perhaps even primarily, because of the "echo effect," the illusion which makes uniformly satellites appear to follow a waviering path. Also cited as unusual were changes in color due to changing atmospheric scattering as the elevation angle changed, and color-scintillation effects near the horizon. Some

Witnesses did not seem to know what satellites look like.
The reports of type C are hardest to understand, since night aircraft activity is constant over Long Island. Probably the most noted effect was appearing as would happen if an aircraft moved toward or away from the observer, especially away from the observer. An airliner climbing and moving away may remain visible for 10 minutes in the same place. If such a climb is followed by a turn, the object may appear to hover for a while, and then move away at greater and greater speed, or it may change color as hidden lights come into view, or even abruptly disappear.
The sightings which remain unaccounted for are mostly similar to the others, but some appear is different enough to warrant further consideration. Some involve objects having definite shape, and these, unless the apparent shape can be accounted for, must remain UFO's for the time being at least.
Only one genuine UFO exists at present, the subject of at least five sightings at the same time and date (1800 to 1820, 30 October 1966). The object was a very bright light of regular shape (when observed) larger than the moon, which came over the area north of Southampton traveling southwest. This object was seen to stop and hover, from several angles, and then departed - the story of the departure is still somewhat confused. The origin of the object was close to the position of Cappella; it followed a path over a power line, made a swing to the west, and then moved southwest to hover just north of Southampton College. Flight time was on the order of 30 seconds to several minutes; hovering time is described as lasting anywhere from a few minutes to at least 20 minutes.

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. The text describes an incident where investigators observed a helicopter cruising at low altitude with several red running lights and two white lights, presenting a "most striking appearance." The text also mentions that three cases had photographs taken, but does not describe any images in this particular document.

Transcribing the text in the document:

It is known that there are helicopters in the area equipped with very bright floodlights, directed downward, which are used during night search and rescue missions. Many possible bases for a helicopter were contacted, including police both local and county, a Marine base, several Coast Guard bases, several Navy bases, private organizations, and SAGE Operations. None had a helicopter operating at the right place and time.

There must still be a source missing, however, because the investigators, on the following night, while traveling on the North Road through the area in question and at the same hour, saw a helicopter cruising at low altitude in the place where no helicopter operations could be accounted for. This helicopter showed several red running lights and two white lights (not floodlights, however), and presented a most striking appearance.

We cannot call this case positively identified yet, because there is no sighting in which the object can be associated with a known flight or a properly equipped helicopter.

THE PHOTOGRAPHS

In three cases, photographs were taken. The first appeared in newspapers on 22 October, and showed only a much-enlarged round fuzzy object. This was said to be a photograph of what the police in Patchogue had seen. The original negative was seen by GAPR personnel, who reported that the image was 0.025 inch in diameter. It is certainly a stellar image.

The second photo was taken by [REDACTED]. He stated that he saw an oval object to the west, from a position just off the New York Expressway (Lt. Marley will provide a more detailed report). The object was covered by clouds in about 15 seconds.

- page 35 -

The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document describing a UFO sighting.

Seconds, and shortly thereafter a point-object emerged from behind the cloud and moved eastward. It changed color from white to blue and appeared to accelerate rapidly, disappearing to the east, perhaps into clouds. The observer took many pictures, with a 35 mm camera having a 135 mm telephoto lens. Two frames that were published show an odd-shaped object near the bottoms of the frames; these resemble strong underpass supports with diffuse illumination behind them, and according to the observer are not like the object he first saw. Another published frame shows four wavering streaks, reported as being "the" UFO, plus three others that were not noticed when the pictures were taken. The lateral variations in path match exactly on all four tracks; they are clearly the images of stars, formed as the camera was slowly panned. The stars are the three "belt" stars of Orion, followed by Rigel. It seems that the observer was trying to photograph something, but succeeded only in recording irrelevant background material. There is no evidence of an intentional fraud.

It is highly probable that the observer saw not one but two objects; the first was not positively identified, but the second was all the characteristics of an airplane. The first object was not sufficiently well observed to permit making an evaluation. One might guess that Arcturus (if actually in the right position) might have been behind a haze layer, thus giving the appearance of an extended object. This is only a guess. The only reason given by the observer for associating the second object with the first, despite the great difference in appearance, was that it appeared immediately after the oval was covered by a cloud.

- page 36 -

The image appears to contain two photographs. The text describes the characteristics and details of the photographs, including information about the camera, lens, and exposure settings used to capture the images. However, the text does not identify or name any individuals depicted in the photographs.

The text output is as follows:

"air traffic density is so high in that area, however, that one could not rule out coincidence.

The third set of photographs is definitely a near. A Mr. ***, news photographer in ***, apparently saw and reported the object of 1800 - 1820, 30 October 1966. He sold three photographs to a local newspaper publisher, saying that they were pictures of what he saw. The pictures, however, are almost certainly time exposures of the moon. On one frame, star-trails appear, from which it is apparent that the elongated bright object purported to be the UFO was actually stationary with respect to the stars, having moved the same amount that the stars did. Two of the photographs are actually prints of the same negative, one having been printed for an almost black background. A house appearing in these two prints is about 200 yards ENE of *** location; the camera was pointing east, not overhead, north, or southwest where the object traveled.

The star-trails are 22 mm long on an 8 x 10 print; the image of the moon on the darker print is about 7 mm in diameter, assuming no great overexposure (which may not be the case at all). On this basis, the trails are about 1.5 degrees long. The moon being fairly close to zero declination, this leads to an exposure time of 6 minutes.

Mr. *** says he used a 4 x 5 camera with a 135 mm lens; the star trails on the negative would then have been 12 mm long, giving an angle of motion of the stars of about 11/135 radian, or 1°31', and an exposure time of 18 minutes. On this scale, however, the moon's diameter on the final print would be only 1.2 mm in diameter, which would not seem possible.

*NOTE: *** does not want his name used in connection with his UFO report."

- page 37 -

There is no photograph present in this document. This appears to be a typed text from a Project Blue Book report.

If, however, we assume that the width of the print corresponds to the width of a 35 mm frame, or 34 mm, then the trails are 22/25h or a frame long, or on a 35 mm negative, 2.95. The focal length of a lens which would produce a 2.95 mm trail in 5 minutes would be 95 mm, if we assume a standard 50 mm lens. The time would be increased to 8.5 minutes. In the first case the image of the moon if not overexposed, on the final print would have a diameter of 3.25 mm, and in the second case 5.75 mm. 

In one interview, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Southampton, mentioned seeing the pictures taken by [redacted] on Thursday, October 27; the pictures were clearly neither taken on Sunday night, nor of the UFO. Mrs. [redacted] is Mrs. [redacted] sister-in-law. The interview was taped, and witnessed by Art Setronic of Newday.

The publisher who bought the pictures was given the factual information above, and while no conclusions were suggested by the investigators, it seems certain that these pictures will not be published as UFO pictures.

SUMMARY
Most of the sightings are either positively identified as stars, identical in description to positively identified stars, or identical in description to satellites or aircraft. Of the remaining cases, only two involve a UFO; the [redacted] case involving sighting of an oval object, and the multiple observations of 30 October. Only the 30 October sighting contained enough information to permit stating that an object of unusual nature was in fact present. This case requires further study.

There may well be more reports received from this same series of investigations.

Transcribed text from the document:

ANALYSIS OF CASES ON OR AFTER 21 OCTOBER
In no case was there any evidence of influence due to mental aberrations. The witnesses generally gave good descriptions of the subjective appearance of what they saw; only in two cases were there any signs that the story was being embellished, and in even those the basic observations seemed correct.
The principal factor which led to a UFO report in every case to be failure to recognize what was being seen as something normal. Many witnesses described stars as "starlike," and satellites and airplanes as "like a satellite" or "like an airplane". However, they noticed something unusual, such as color changes, brightness, motions, which to them ruled out the first impression. It is entirely probable that if the witnesses had not heard that UFO's were being seen, they would have accepted the unusual aspects as normal. What was influenced by publicity was not observation, but interpretation.

- page 39 -

This page does not contain any photographs. The text describes various UFO cases that were reported and investigated as part of Project Blue Book. The key points are:

Only two of the investigated cases reported by telephone to the Air Force described something outside the normal range of observation. One of these cases cannot be followed up further unless more sightings are obtained, while the other may be a helicopter carrying powerful lights.

In conclusion, the available information for cases on or after 21 October contains only one case bearing any resemblance to a "typical" UFO report over the past 20 years, and this case is quite likely just a helicopter carrying search and rescue lights.

Prior to 21 October, several interesting reports were obtained, including a sighting of a bright cylindrical object moving at high speed, observed by an experienced air traffic controller and his assistant.

The text does not identify any individuals and focuses on describing the reported UFO cases and the investigations around them.

The text of the document is as follows:

EVIDENCE AND RECORDS
The records of reports and tapes of interviews are retained at Project Blue Book headquarters, together with copies of photographs and news clippings. Specific data on witnesses will be worked up on summary sheets, so that the content of this general report may be checked in detail if desired.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It was clear that the Suffolk County Air Force Base could not possibly conduct meaningful investigations of the UFO reports received there; an appreciation of the difficulties involved gave insight into what must be a problem at Air Force bases generally. The principal difficulties arise from lack of background knowledge and investigational experience on the part of personnel assigned to UFO duty, and the time and travel requirements involved in conducting full investigations. Most UFO reports are handled by telephone; they may come from anywhere within 100 miles of the base. The only sure way to get the information right, however, is to stand with the witness at the place of a sighting and tape the witness's own description; the inevitable consequence of failure to do this is generation of incomplete and even incorrect reports, and ultimate issuance of "explanations" that are indefensible. It would not seem likely on a statistical basis that many genuine UFO's would be missed (although some certainly have been missed), but it is a virtual certainty that investigations of unacceptable quality will lead to official statements which can only ultimately embarrass the Air Force.

pattern analysis studies in the future.

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be discussing the challenges and limitations in dealing with UFO reports, including the lack of detailed information, the difficulty in justifying conclusions, and the inherent difficulties and inconveniences involved in UFO investigations.

The text in the document is as follows:

The scientific background, investigational experience, and objectivity required for dealing with UFO reports cannot be found in randomly selected personnel. Useful UFO reports cannot be taken exclusively by telephone. The report forms in use are not likely to contain enough information to permit justification of conclusions, especially, as is inevitable, when they are not filled out completely and the interviewer makes little or no attempt to obtain the whole story.

All these factors must be taken into account when one considers the apparent UFO situation. Nearly all the data on which Air Force policy has been based have come first through UFO officers at various Air Force bases, and the faults noted above have played a major part in creating the impression that nothing of interest is to be found in UFO reports. The blame cannot be narrowed to a single person or procedure. The cause of this situation is primarily the inherent difficulties and inconveniences involved in UFO investigations.

It is not possible to establish an every Air Force base a competent UFO investigation team which can, leave other duties at a moment's notice to spend an hour or a day in the field. It is unreasonable to expect to find at every base people with the required training, experience and objectivity. While improvements can certainly be made at the Air Base level, the problem will not be solved by such improvements.

The only feasible way to commence handling UFO reports as they need to be handled is to greatly enlarge the capabilities of Project Blue Book. This is entirely aside from scientific investigations now under way; the scientific groups cannot possibly keep up with the reports, even if their sole task was investigation of UFO reports.

- page 42 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s.

The text on the page discusses the Project Blue Book program and its approach to investigating UFO reports. It mentions that the program's budget was tripled, and that Blue Book is responsible for doing justice to all reports, both good and bad, from the standpoint of data-gathering. The text also discusses the program's staffing, noting that it employs carefully selected assistants who can handle letter answering, filing, and indexing.

The text then goes on to discuss the skeptical nature of Blue Book's approach, stating that "few reports merit an all-out effort" and that the program is "perpetually behind" when it comes to investigating sightings. It also suggests that the Air Force's policy is to view UFOs as misidentifications rather than actual phenomena.

Overall, this page appears to provide an insider's perspective on the operations and approach of Project Blue Book.

Investigations. They will not find much of use to them. Little can be done about that at this late date, but it is possible to start a second-generation effort, so that all new data will be of use in unravelling the UFO phenomenon. It is recommended most seriously that this second-generation effort be started just as soon as it can be organized.

There is no mention of identifying any humans in the report.
