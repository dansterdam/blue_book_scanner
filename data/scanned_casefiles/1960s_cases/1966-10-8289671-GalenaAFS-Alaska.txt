Dear Sirs: Three months ago when I was in my back yard I saw a disc shaped object that glowed with a reddish color. This object was about 4 degrees above the western horizon. I observed the craft for about 30 seconds and then it went down behind a row of trees by my house. The next day I went to the area where it landed and cut area of about thirty feet was charred and burned. The time I saw this object the sky was clear of all clouds. The time was about seven p.m.

In the sky the object seemed to go forward then backward and then straight down. If possible I will try to get a picture of where it landed because it is still plain to see.

Could you please send me some information on what to do and if I see this

Dear Miss [redacted]

Reference your letter of August 23, 1966, concerning the observance of an unidentified flying object on October 16, 1965. Your report has been studied by our analysts and they are unable to reach a conclusive explanation due to the date of your sighting.

Sightings such as yours are extremely difficult to trace since there is such a time lapse involved. Even reports several months old are somewhat difficult to analyze.

I regret the unfortunate circumstances that arose, causing such a delay in reporting your observation. Your report will be kept on file to aid our analysts in their future investigations.

If in the future you observe another unidentified object, suggest you place a collect telephone call to the nearest Air Force Base. They in turn will do a prompt investigation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. For your information we are including the brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects.

Garden City, Long Island, New York
October 29th, 1966

Wright Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Attention Project Blue Book

Gentlemen:

Reference is made to the glowing object sighted over Long Island on October 22nd. I am a with an enroute from Shannon, Ireland to New York International Airport. Perhaps the following may interest you:

At approximately 21002, making good about 240 deg. True, at an altitude of 31000 ft, we sighted an orange-red glowing object about 30 deg. to our left. Visibility was good with sky conditions broken to scattered above and no weeds. It appeared to be far on the horizon and our first impression was that it was something ablaze on the water; our intention was to continue on our course until the object came about of us, which time we could investigate. However, at our speed of about 480 knots, as we continued to watch, it never did come near, and although there was no apparent motion relative to us, it continued to maintain its same position. At one time it disappeared, and a few minutes re-appeared; this we thought could be due to clouds on the horizon; also, at one time, momentarily, the glow seemed to break into two parts. There was no definite shape to the glow and it was about the size of a sun-diameter. I observed it with the sextans, and found it to be 3 degrees color the horizon. We observed it for about 30 minutes. Our position was about 48 deg. N 33 deg. W.

The above figures are approximate as I remember them; they were noted more accurately on my chart which has been filled with our operations office in Miami. If you desire more exact data, I can obtain it from the chart.

There were three other crew members besides myself that observed the glow and its final deduction that it was a reflected image of the moon, or the actual sunset, due to refraction.

Very truly yours,

Proposed reply to a letter from [redacted] 29 Oct 66

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of [redacted]October 29, 1966 regarding a glowing object sighted over Long Island on October 22 is appreciated. It is most helpful in our evaluations when persons, such as yourself, report an unusual observation and offer a possible explanation to its cause or causes.

There have been several alleged UFO sightings in the Long Island area which have been reported to the Air Force as of late. We do have We are studying one observation, which occurred on October 22 at 2000 hours, local time, which does fit the description you provided. Other similar observations have been reported of a star-like object observed in the western sky.

However, we feel that the star Arcturus is responsible for these sightings. Did you and the other crew members observe a very bright star in addition to your reported observation? Arcturus would have been setting on an azimuth of 200 degrees at 2000 hours EDT.

If you can remember exact data on your sighting and if your crew did observe Arcturus in addition to the unidentified, it would be most helpful.

Thank you for your informative letter and we hope to hear from you soon.

SUMMARY REPORT

UFO Investigation of Oct. 29 - Nov. 2, 1966
W. T. Powers, Systems Engineer
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

INTRODUCTION

On October 21, 1966, at about 0100, EDT, policemen at Patchogue, Long Island, sighted an object over the ocean to the southeast. They reported this object as flashing red, green, and blue, and as being extremely bright.

The object would occasionally rise and fall, and dart side to side, however, it always returned to the same place. Over a period of hours the object traveled very slowly to the right and up; it was observed by some of the policemen until dawn.

This incident was reported to the Suffolk County Air Force base by the policemen, who called while the event was in progress. The press obtained the story, probably not from all the witnesses, and printed stories about a "hot dog shaped" object hovering near Patchogue. During the following nine days, SCAFB received about 50 reports of UFOs, the local police in various towns receiving several times that number.

On October 29, 1966, two investigators from Project Blue Book arrived: 1st. Lt. William Marley, and Mr. William Powers, civilian consultant. Lt. Marley is a member of the Blue Book staff at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and is in the field of metallurgy. Mr. Powers is from the Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University, where he is in charge of design and development of electronic-optical systems. Mr. Powers is also familiar with astronomical phenomena and photographic techniques.

THE INVESTIGATION

The investigators arrived the evening of October 29; they spent that evening and the following morning going through all sightings reported to SCARB during 1966. A classification scheme was devised to apply to the sightings since October 21, and these sightings were coded as to type, on the basis of descriptions in the reports. It was found that the majority of reports would be described as follows:

Type A: Bright object 10 to 30 degrees above the horizon, observed for long periods, usually terminated by the witness' ceasing to watch. The object appeared to flash red, green, blue and white. Occasionally it might rise, move erratically about, or dive, but always stayed near the same average position. This average position would change very slowly over a period from 20 minutes to several hours; some objects would move higher, one would move lower in the sky. Repeated appearances would occur on successive nights. The objects would be described as "brighter than a star," "larger than a star," "round," "oval," "long and thin," or "cylindrical". All, however, were much smaller than the moon. In binoculars the object showed greater color effects, and a spinning or chaotic motion, within itself. Its motions were greatest when seen through binoculars.

Type B: The object appeared starlike, sometimes flickering red and green or changing color to dull orange or red near the horizon. It would be in definite, constant motion relative to stars, following a path from south to north or from west to east, or a path between these limits. It would occasionally seem to "zig-zag" or change course, although maintaining the same general direction. Its shape would be described as


- page 31 -

Here is the text from the document:

"like a star" or "round" or "too far away to tell." Its height was generally taken to be about that of airliners. Observations lasted 2 to 20 minutes, the object sometimes disappearing while still in the sky.

Type C: The object would display a flashing red light, sometimes alternating with white, and sometimes with other red, green, or white lights moving together. The course was generally straight, although the object sometimes appeared to change course or come to a stop.

Most (all but about 10) of the incidents fell into these three categories. Type A objects are stars, type B are satellites, and type C are high altitude aircraft. All descriptions which fit the above summaries with no anomalies were taken to be identified.

The aspects of type A sightings which caused the witnesses to report them as UFO's were the changing colors and the erratic motions.

In a few cases the slow drift due to the rising or setting of the object was taken to indicate something out of the ordinary. In other words, many people did not know that stars show color scintillations when near the horizon, were not aware that prolonged fixation on an isolated object will result in apparent motions due to the natural shifting of the eyes, and did not know that stars rise and set. All these effects were attributed to the object itself.

Type B sightings gave rise to UFO reports partly, perhaps even primarily, because of the "Echo effect", the illusion which makes uniformly-moving satellites appear to follow a wavering path. Also cited as unusual were changes in color due to changing atmospheric scattering as the elevation angle changed, and color-scintillation effects near the horizon. Some


- page 32 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

witnesses did not seem to know what satellites look like.

The reports of type C are hardest to understand, since night aircraft activity is constant over Long Island. Probably the most noted effect was apparent hovering as would happen if an aircraft moved toward or away from, especially away from, the observer. An airliner climbing and moving away may remain visible for 10 minutes in the same place. If such a climb is followed by a turn, the object may appear to hover for a while, and then move away at greater and greater speed, or it may change color as hidden lights come into view, or even abruptly disappear.

The sightings which remain unaccounted for are mostly similar to the others, but some aspect is different enough to warrant further consideration. Some involve objects having definite shape, and these, unless the apparent shape can be accounted for, must remain UFO's for the time being at least.

Only one genuine UFO exists at present, the subject of at least five sightings at the same time and date (1800 to 1820, 30 October 1966).

The object was a very bright light of angular diameter (when overhead) larger than the moon, which came over the area north of Southampton traveling southwest. This object was seen to stop and hover, from several angles, and then departed - the story of the departure is still somewhat confused. The origin of the object was close to the position of Cappella; it followed a path over a power line, made a swing to the west, and then moved southwest to hover just north of Southampton College. Flight time was on the order of 30 seconds to several minutes; hovering time is described as lasting anywhere from a few minutes to at least 20 minutes.

It is known that there are helicopters in the area equipped with very bright floodlights, directed downward, which are used during night search and rescue missions. Many possible bases for a helicopter were contacted, including police both local and county, a Marine base, several Coast Guard bases, several Navy bases, private organizations, and SCATB Operations. None had a helicopter operating at the right place and time.

There must still be a source missing, however, because the investigators, on the following night, while traveling on the North Road through the area in question and at the same hour, saw a helicopter cruising 558 at low altitude, in the place where no helicopter operations could be accounted for. This helicopter showed several red running lights and two white lights (not floodlights, however), and presented a most striking appearance.

We cannot call this case positively identified yet, because there is no sighting in which the object can be associated with a known flight of a properly equipped helicopter.

THE PHOTOGRAPHS

In three cases, photographs were taken. The first appeared in newspapers on 22 October, and showed only a much-enlarged round fuzzy object. This was said to be a photograph of what the police in Patchogue had seen. The original negative was seen by SCATB personnel, who reported that the image was 0.025 inch in diameter. It is certainly a stellar image.

The second photo was taken by [redacted], a photographer for the [redacted]. He stated that he saw an oval object to the west, from a position just off the New York Expressway (Lt. Marley will provide a more detailed report). The object was covered by clouds in about 15


- page 35 -

seconds, and shortly thereafter a point-object emerged from behind the cloud and moved eastward. It changed color from white to blue and appeared to accelerate rapidly, disappearing to the east, perhaps into clouds. Mr. [redacted] took many pictures, with a 35 mm camera having a 135 mm telephoto lens. Two frames that were published show an odd-shaped object near the bottoms of the frames; these resemble strongly underpass supports with diffuse illumination behind them, and according to Mr. [redacted] are not like the object he first saw. Another published frame shows four wavering streaks, reported as being "the" UFO, plus three others that were not noticed when the pictures were taken. The lateral variations in path match exactly on all four tracks; they are clearly the images of stars, formed as the camera was slowly panned past them. The stars are the three "belt" stars of Orion, followed by Rigel. It seems that [redacted] was trying to photograph something, but succeeded only in recording irrelevant background material. There is no evidence of an intentional fraud.

It is highly probable that [redacted] saw not one but two objects; the first, the oval, is not positively identified, but the second has all the characteristics of an airplane. The first object was not sufficiently well observed to permit making an evaluation. One might guess that Arcturus (if actually in the right position) might have been behind a haze layer, thus giving the appearance of an extended object. This is only a guess. The only reason given by [redacted] for associating the second object with the first, despite the great difference in appearance, was that it appeared immediately after the oval was covered by a cloud.


- page 36 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

air traffic density is so high in that area, however, that one could not
rule out coincidence.

The third set of photographs is definitely a hoax. A Mr. [blacked out], 
news photographer in [blacked out] apparently actually saw and reported
the object of 1800 - 1820, 30 October 1966. He sold three photographs
to a local newspaper publisher, saying that they were pictures of what he
saw. The pictures, however, are almost certainly time exposures of the
moon. On one frame, star-trails appear, from which it is apparent that
the elongated bright object purported to be the UFO was actually stationary
with respect to the stars, having moved the same amount that the stars did.
Two of the photographs are actually prints of the same negatives, one having
been printed for an almost black background. A house appearing in these
two prints is about 200 yards ENE of [blacked out] location; the camera was
pointing east, not overhead, north, or southwest where the object
traveled.

The star-trails are 22 mm long on an 8 x 10 print; the image of
the moon on the darker print is about 7 mm in diameter, assuming no great
overexposure (which may not be the case at all). On this basis, the trails
are about 1.5 degrees long. The moon being fairly close to zero declination,
this leads to an exposure time of 6 minutes.

Mr. [blacked out] says he used a 4 x 5 camera with a 135 mm lens; the star
trails on the negative would then have been 11 mm long, giving an angle
of motion of the stars of about 11/135 radian, or 4°31', and an exposure
time of 18 minutes. On this scale, however, the moon's diameter on the
final print would be only 1.2 mm in diameter, which would not seem possible.

*NOTE: [blacked out] does not want his name used in connection with his UFO report


- page 37 -

If, however, we assume that the width of the print corresponds to
the width of a 35 mm frame, or 34 mm, then the trails are 22/24 of a frame
long, or on a 35 mm negative, 2.95. The focal length of a lens which would
produce a 2.95 mm trail in 6 minutes would be 95 mm; if we assume a standard
50 mm lens the time would be reduced to 4.25 minutes, and if a 135 mm lens
is assumed, the time would be increased to 8.5 minutes. In the first case
the image of the moon if not overexposed, on the final print would have a
diameter of 3.25 mm, and in the second case 8.75 mm.

In one interview, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] of Southampton, mentioned seeing the pictures taken by [redacted] on Thursday,
October 27; the pictures were clearly neither taken on Sunday night, nor
of the UFO. Mrs. [redacted] is Mr. [redacted]'s sister-in-law. The interview was
taped, and witnessed by Art Beltrone of Newsday.

The publisher who bought the pictures was given the factual information above, and while no conclusions were suggested by the investigators,
it seems certain that these pictures will not be published as UFO pictures.

SUMMARY

Most of the sightings are either positively identified as stars,
identical in description to positively identified stars, or identical in
description to satellites or aircraft. Of the remaining cases, only two
involve a UFO; the [redacted] case involving sighting of an oval object,
and the multiple observations of 30 October. Only the 30 October sighting
contained enough information to permit stating that an object of unusual
nature was in fact present. This case requires further study.

There may well be more reports received from this same series of


- page 38 -

Here is the text from the document:

events, since not all reported cases could be investigated and only 1/5 to 1/3 of the sightings were reported to the Air Force. For this reason no blanket statement concerning all the sightings should be made. ALL that can be said is that the investigation strongly suggests that the sightings were caused primarily by erroneous publicity given to the report from the Patchogue police. This publicity brought many people outdoors looking for UFO's, and their evident unfamiliarity with normal sources of light in the nighttime sky caused them to report unfamiliar objects as UFO's. Every witness interviewed stated that he had been outside looking for UFO's because of the publicity.

ANALYSIS OF CASES ON OR AFTER 21 OCTOBER

In no case was there any evidence of influence due to mental aberrations. The witnesses generally gave good descriptions of the subjective appearance of what they saw; only in two cases were there any signs that the story was being embellished, and in even these two the basic observations seemed correct.

The principal factor which led to a UFO report seemed in every case to be failure to recognize what was being seen as something normal. Many witnesses described stars as "starlike," and satellites and airplanes as "like a satellite" or "like an airplane". However, they noticed something unusual, such as color changes, brightness, or unexpected motions, which to them ruled out the first impression. It is entirely probable that if the witnesses had not heard that UFO's were being seen, they would have accepted the unusual aspects as normal. What was influenced by publicity was not observation, but interpretation.


- page 39 -

Only in two of the investigated cases or cases reported by telephone to the Air Force was anything described which would be outside the normal variations of observation. One of these cannot be followed further unless more sightings are obtained; the other may be a helicopter carrying powerful lights (such types are known to be operational in the general area), but until the helicopter in question can be located this case must remain open. This is the only case in which the observations definitely point to presence of a very unusual object.

In conclusion, it may be said that the available information for cases on or after 21 October contains only one case bearing any resemblance to a class of UFO report typical of "unknowns" over the past 20 years, and that it is quite likely that this one was a helicopter carrying search and rescue lights. This was a highly unusual "wave" in that the initial sightings appear to have had no substance at all.

OTHER CASES

Prior to 21 October several interesting reports were obtained, one involving a sighting of a bright cylindrical object moving at high speed, observed by an experienced air traffic controller and his assistant, from the control tower at [redacted]. This is definitely a UFO; it had been reported to Blue Book prior to the events of 21 October. The object was well observed by two experienced people and cannot be explained at this time. This and several other cases are being studied at Project Blue Book headquarters; it is not likely that any additional information can be obtained without more effort than Blue Book can spare, so the cases will have to be treated as part of overall statistical and


- page 40 -

pattern analysis studies in the future.

EVIDENCE AND RECORDS

The records of reports and tapes of interviews are retained at Project Blue Book headquarters, together with copies of photographs and news clippings. Specific data on witnesses will be worked up on summary sheets, so that the content of this general report may be checked in detail if desired.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It was clear that the Suffolk County Air Force Base could not possibly conduct meaningful investigations of the UFO reports received there; an appreciation of the difficulties involved gave insight into what must be a problem at Air Force bases generally. The principal difficulties arise from lack of background knowledge and investigational experience on the part of personnel assigned to UFO duty, and the time and travel requirements involved in conducting full investigations. Most UFO reports are handled by telephone; they may come from anywhere within 100 miles of the base. The only sure way to get the information right, however, is to stand with the witness at the place of a sighting and tape the witness's own description; the inevitable consequence of failure to do this is generation of incomplete and even incorrect reports, and ultimate issuance of "explanations" that are indefensible. It would not seem likely on a statistical basis that many genuine UFO's would be missed (although some certainly have been missed), but it is a virtual certainty that investigations of unacceptable quality will lead to official statements which can only ultimately embarrass the Air Force.


- page 41 -

The scientific background, investigational experience, and
objectivity required for dealing with UFO reports cannot be found in
randomly selected personnel. Useful UFO reports cannot be taken exclusively
by telephone. The report forms in use are not likely to contain enough
information to permit justification of conclusions, especially, as is
inevitable, when they are not filled out completely and the interviewer
makes little or no attempt to obtain the whole story.

All these factors must be taken into account when one considers
the apparent UFO situation. Nearly all the data on which Air Force policy
has been based have come first through UFO officers at various Air Force
bases, and the faults noted above have played a major part in creating
the impression that nothing of interest is to be found in UFO reports.

The blame cannot be narrowed to a single person or procedure. The cause
of this situation is primarily the inherent difficulties and inconveniences
involved in UFO investigations. It is not possible to establish at every
Air Force base a competent UFO investigation team which can leave other
duties at a moment's notice to spend an hour or a day in the field. It
is unreasonable to expect to find at every base people with the required
training, experience and objectivity. While improvements can certainly
be made at the Air Base level, the problem will not be solved by such
improvements.

The only feasible way to commence handling UFO reports as they need
to be handled is to greatly enlarge the capabilities of Project Blue Book.
This is entirely aside from scientific investigations now under way; the
scientific groups cannot possibly keep up with the reports, even if their


- page 42 -

budget were tripled. Only Blue Book is in any position to do justice to
all reports, good and bad, from the standpoint of data-gathering. But
instead of one field investigator, Blue Book needs ten; instead of one
secretary, at least four, and instead of one untrained airman, carefully
picked assistants who can handle letter answering and filing and indexing.

To be sure, few reports merit an all-out effort. On the other
hand, Blue Book is perpetually behind, and when a wave of sightings occurs,
the coverage is truly sketchy, even when continuing duties are completely
abandoned. Moreover, if as some people maintain, there is no substance at
all in any UFO reports, the only way to settle the problem once and for all
is to commit the necessary effort to it until the job is done. As matters
stand the Air Force policy to the effect that UFO's are all misidentifications
is not based on fact; to the contrary, the "facts" on file have been strongly,
even fatally, biased by the very policy they are thought to support. This
has been observed not only at Suffolk County Air Force Base but in reports
from most other bases.

To the general public, the reality of something of interest behind
UFO reports is a matter for belief or disbelief; to an investigating team,
it should only be a matter of fact or non-fact. The existence of any
policy statement is quite irrelevant; the facts are whatever they are,
regardless of blanket statements. Blue Book's sole objective should be
to determine the facts in full, as objectively as humanly possible, and
without any pressure to adopt one or another point of view.

Sooner or later the scientific investigators are going to ask
for the data on file, in order to interpret the results of their own


- page 43 -

investigations. They will not find much of use to them. Little can be done about that at this late date, but it is possible to start a second-generation effort, so that all new data will be of use in unravelling the UFO phenomenon. It is recommended most seriously that this second-generation effort be started just as soon as it can be organized.
