Sightings of six separate objects on various days always at 11 A.M. All flight was straight of all objects.

COMMENTS: Duration consistent with A/C observations. One object on initial report confirms with balloon observation. WK balloon launched from Charleston West VA at 1200Z and might possibly have been in area. All sightings by this witness regarded as misinterpretation of conventional object such as A/C or balloons. No data presented in the reports to indicate that the object could NOT have been caused by balloons or A/C. A/C in the area during all sightings. No reports from Radar of anything unusual during all reports and A/C were in the area at all times of observations.

SEPARATED BY APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES. THIS INDICATES A POSSIBLE
CONFIRMATION, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE UFO WAS OBSERVED BY TWO PEOPLE
AT THE SAME TIME. HOWEVER, THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVE, CIGAR-SHAPED
VERSUS A SQUARE AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD, CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO
CONFIRM EACH OTHER. SINCE ALL THREE WITNESSES ARE RELIABLE, I MUST
JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WAS OBSERVED IN EACH CASE. THE WEATHER
BALLOON CITED IN PARAGRAPH J MIGHT FIT THE CIGAR DESCRIPTION. BUT
I OFFER THIS AS ONLY A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. I CAN OFFER NOTHING
MORE DEFINITE.
L. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE.
