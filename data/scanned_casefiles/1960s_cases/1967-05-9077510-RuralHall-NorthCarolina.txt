Reference your May 1967 observation of an unidentified flying object. Prior to remaking our final conclusion on your sighting we need to know the exact date. The initial report indicated the sighting occurred on the night of 14 May 1967 however, the questionnaire you completed indicates that the sighting occurred on Wednesday night, May 15, 1967 at approximately 8:30 p.m. We would appreciate a note from you clarifying this discrepancy.

In reference to the above letter arriving to state of my opinion, Saturday does not fall on the 14th nor the 15th. Here then a lapse of time since my sighting that I am positive it was on a Wednesday night and about 9 minutes that it was May 19 at 8 p.m. and on the paper the next day left my sighting of some sighting at 8 p.m. in the date of 15. (the same night of my sighting) possibly due a slight error. I am very clear thinking 8th date confirms that when in question. not a typist like you. I just wrote in the wrong date. I have clarified this with my writing that also now the 15 date means me.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

My neighbor and I were standing in my front yard Wednesday night, approximately 8:30 pm, April 19, 1967. I noticed a jet more than in the sky. Then I saw another jet pass. Sometime to my neighbor about how I was tracking this. Then I said, something is following me. I was thinking this "I will sit out I thought my eye. Note it started out of sight. The flight path of the jet was straight line, but the object made a zigzag. Then, the jet left a large trail. And the object left no trail at all. It definitely was not traveling in a straight path.

Another Report
One private flyer ... Aug. 15, 1957, near Woodlawn Hills, Calif., observed a UFO "hovering between two drifting trees."

A book to be published next spring, written by two Navy members, will cite several UFO sightings. UFOs have been circling the earth for at least 200 years, it knows more than were recorded in a book entitled "Der Kugelblitz," by Walter Brand, published in Germany in 1923, preceding the current wave by 40 years.

Matching Reports
Flammation recounted stories of legendary saucers and 100-200 years ago which reported characteristics closely matching those of more recent surveys by competent observers. A comprehensive survey by Warren D. Rayle of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lewis Research Center, Dr. Edward M. Dewar of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories and Dr. J. R. McNally of the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Marines were telling "We must confess that if we were to write a book on UFOs, it would be a very complicated and its solution perhaps controversial." Our ignorance alone is the cause.

Deep Explanation
Many objects have a ready explanation for this curious reluctance. Extraordinary visual testimony, the total of creating what some call an "optical illusion" or "hallucination."

For this reason they prefer to conserve secrecy.

But this makes it even more difficult to explain the capricious and sudden games of tag that UFOs seem to play with observers of aircraft and other vehicles, defying all known laws of human observation—unless the UFO is plasma.

If secret observation is the intent, the only nation of UFOs have defied this approach. For example, a recent Gallup poll indicates that least half of the U.S. population in America is seeing something.

Faced with this serious contradiction, most officials have another ready explanation. It is not possible to use such "earth-logic" in trying to understand the actions of extraterrestrial visitors. This precludes any further effort aimed at rationalizing the contradiction.

There are almost as many theories about the origin of UFOs as there are scientists interested in the phenomena. Most scientists agree that no single theory yet advanced, their own included, can explain all reported characteristics.

This leads many to conclude that the UFOs represent different but related phenomena involved. The high-altitude UFO type plasmas may involve still other trigger mechanisms and remaining mechanisms, but all are believed to share a common framework.

Keep Explanation

Application Symposium
Washington-Navy will sponsor a symposium on advanced aerospace systems Oct. 17-18 at State Dept. auditorium here. The papers will be those presented earlier in Europe at a conference sponsored by NATO's Advisory Group on Aerospace Research and Development (AGARD).

Persons who wish to attend must preregister. Contact Naval Research, Code 406c, Washington, D.C. 20430.

Laser Range Finders for Tanks Developed by TRG, Inc.

Laser range finders, developed by TRG, Inc. for tanks to obtain accurate range to targets, include gun shield mounted laser (yellow) for the United Kingdom, and turret mounted laser (blue) components as (A) commander's control and display, (B) laser transmitter and receiver, (C) gunner's control and display and (D) power supply and controls.

Flying Particles Observed

Flying vortices of charged dust and small particles have been observed frequently in desert areas. They are produced by Dr. Gus Froh of the University of Minnesota in the Sahara desert at an electric field intensity as high as ~50 V. at an altitude of 300-600 ft. and a proximity no closer than 160 ft. The dust devil had a diameter of ~23 ft. in the presence of a strong electric field, small dust devils should be able to reach even higher altitudes.

Those who hold that UFOs are extraterrestrial visitors contend that their behavior demonstrates "intelligent control." Some airborne UFOs, for example, seem to exhibit a curious aerial, while log-off flying ones show alterations or autonomous motions or traits.

Often UFOs seem to be playing a game of tag with an airplane or automobile, and not infrequently will "buzz" them in what can only be described as a "teardropper's game of chicken."

"Intelligent Control"

There are reports of military jet fighters which was have attempted to close upon a UFO, only to have it suddenly move away. That such maneuvers comes near violating known aerodynamic principles has nearly closed the door on such explanations.

At other times the UFO darts at the aircraft or is seen coming out of the cloud at nearly vertical angles of climb. In such encounters, the UFO will circle an aircraft in flight as if inspecting it, then depart with apparent intelligent control.

Such behavior more demonstrably suggests the well known physical law that two charged objects having opposite electric polarity will attract and two having identical polarity will repel. Aircraft fuselages usually carry a net positive charge of particles acquired from the atmosphere, while dust particles in the air. Jet aircraft also acquire a charge from their turbine engines.

There is evidence that indicates that some of Knight's parameters in a "magnetic bottle" which sustains it, although not all form achieving magnetic containment. One theory advanced to explain ball lightning suggests that its electrons comes from a core of spiraling electrons surrounded by a crust of positive ions.

Under these and other conditions, a plasma having the opposite charge may zoom toward or away from the "magnetic bottle."

A typical encounter cited occurred during World War II on 10, 1944, while a bomber was returning from a strike in Sumatra. The aircraft was flying at 14,000 ft. above the clouds with an overcast below when the crew spotted a "ball"...
