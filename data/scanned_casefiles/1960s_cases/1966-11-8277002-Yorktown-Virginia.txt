(d) Winds:
Surface     070/19     10:1     040/23
2n          040/17     20:4     030/36
4n          035/16     30:1     020/43
6n          050/14     40:1     300/45

n. Meteorological Activity:
Meteor activity in the area of the sighting was probably increased above normal, according to Winsor L. Sherman of the Langley NASA Research Center, telephone 703-722-7961, extension 2200. The second Keteer Space Sixer was 17 November 1966 from 0500 0400 to 0830 Wlu. Mt. _______ stated that "_______ sighting sounded like a jolting vector, commonly called "fire balls". This type meteor will appear to travel more horizontally and can be viewed longer than other meteors. The night of the sighting was especially clear and good for observing a Bolide Meteor.

i. Air Traffic:
High performance, single-engine jet traffic is very dense in the Langley Air Force Base, Oceana Naval Air Station and Norfolk Naval Air Station. On a clear night the afterburner fires of these jets are often visible at undetermined distances.

2. This report was prepared by Captain Robert R. Dockum, 4500 Air Base Wing (DOV-P), Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, 23365; office telephone 703-764-4359, home 703-826-2119. The facts in this report were gathered in a personal interview with the _______ and in December 1966. The attached letter, written by _______ is referred to in this report. Mr. _______ stated that he is interested in articles about UFO's and newspaper articles about Dr. Condon and Dr. Hynek. His interest in UFO's was also revealed by newspaper articles displayed on the walls of his laboratory. Mr. _______ Lawler stated that what he saw "may have been a shooting star". He also stated that he was surprised that the Air Force was giving so much attention to this recorded sighting.

The investigating officer for this report believes the object was probably a meteor. It could also have been the tail-pipe exhaust or afterburner fire of a jet aircraft.

To Whom It May Concern:

As I saw an UFO last night and thought it should be reported, I have decided to send my observational notes to you. I am also sending copies of these notes to Dr. Edward U. Condon of the University of Colorado and to Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University. The notes are as follows:

1. Observers *:
a. Graduate Assistant, Parasitology Section, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Gloucester Point, Virginia, 23062.
b. Associate Information Officer, Virginia Institute of Marine Science

*Two passengers in the back seat of the car did not see the object. They Were:
a. Research Assistant, Applied Science, Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences
b. Assistant Marine Scientist, Physical Oceanography, Virginia Institute of Marine Science

2. Time: Approximate time 7:50-8:00 PM EST, 22 November 1966.

3. Observation from: Car travelling at about 45 mph on Colonial Parkway from Williamsburg, Va. towards Yorktown, Va.

4. Place of observation: Approximately 1/2 mile west of bridge across King Creek (about 37° 16' 13" N Lat; 76° 36' 30" W Long.)

5. Direction of path of object: Appeared to be travelling directly South (path should have crossed over Port Eustis, Va. parallel to the ground at undetermined height.

6. Object's position angle: 25-30°
(angle of elevation)

7. Duration of observation: 2-3 seconds, until trees along the parkway hid it from view.

8. Notes on Object:   Oval to circular in shape. Object extremely bright, less intense light area trailing after object. Color blue-green to yellow-green. Sparks appearing to come from sides and rear of object. Object left no apparent trail ("vapor" or otherwise). Witness had passes. No sound heard above the noise of the car motor. No sound of its hurtling earth. Travelling at high rate of speed. Seemed to be large.

9. Rough sketch of object:   OBJECT = ???????

[A hand-drawn sketch shows two trees on either side of a parkway, with an oval/circular object drawn above the trees, leaving a trail of sparks or light]

I would like to know ify there is a natural explanation for this observation. I have not reported this to any newspaper and would prefer to have my name unpublicized.

Thank you.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
