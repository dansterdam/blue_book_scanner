UFO Observations, 6 February 1968

Det 21, 6 Weather Wing
Attn: Mrs. Hilton
Edwards AFB, California 93523

1. Reference the unidentified flying object (UFO) reports of 6 February 1968 which you forwarded to our office on 12 Point 117. Originally this form is used only for additional investigation; a preliminary report is submitted to our office in accordance with paragraph 11a of AFR 80-17 and change 1 thereto.

2. Each Air Force installation has an UFO investigator and at Edwards AFB he is:
Major S. G. Calder
Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory
est 74555 or 72440

3. We feel that the witnesses were probably observing the planet Jupiter, which on 6 February 1968, had a stellar magnitude of --2.1.

4. In the future, if you receive any UFO reports, please direct them to Major Calder's office.
