This image does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of diagrams and illustrations. The image shows:

1. A compass rose illustration with directional labels (N, NW, W, etc.) and instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a phenomenon.

2. Two sketches or illustrations depicting a person in a landscape. The larger sketch shows a person standing in an open field or landscape, while the smaller sketch shows a person standing on a hilltop or elevated area looking out over a landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:
