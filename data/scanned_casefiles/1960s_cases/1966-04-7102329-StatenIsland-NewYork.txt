April 28, 1966

Gentle men:

Last week about
5 A.M. I was putting up my
shade + the round river looks
N.Y. Bay out toward the Atlantic
Ocean. Close home is high.
Over one the Atlantic Blvd.
I saw the same object
described on page 42 in May
Readers Digest. About a huge
object as circle of brilliant
pulsating red lights but I
didn't see it slide way. I
was looking thru the circle
It stayed in one spot about
two minutes. Then drifted
out to sea slowly. It looked
like a blinking light or only
it was a circle of blue lights
and (164)

I dislike telling any one until I read the items in Reader's Digest + the picture. The flying lights wasn't exactly round. But as plane does it struel still + then go as few miles + stop again like this did.

I would say it was over the City of Atlantic City over the ocean. I was looking south west from Staten Island N.Y.

Sincerely,

I got up one morning about 4:30 A.M.

I always get up early + my bedroom is in the attic + when I turned my shade toward the partition

I saw this count pulsating circle of lights. I watched it for about 4 or 5 mins. I would have forgotten about it, if I had it. Read the same story in Readers Digest "May". The object was too high to be two tracks + it was not a plane. I'll seem to maybe. Its was stationary. Then it moved some + hovered + seemed to move quite a bit from the window + the pulsating lights never stopped. The
