10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: White obj size of half dollar, sighted - 30° elevation, Disappeared - 40° elevation, Plane - DC6B United, located 6551-180, 270, 210 knots, Seattle.

11. COMMENTS: Witnesses report obj had a slight movement, which would have been due to movement of a/c. Azimuth of obj was not given, only direction of movement. Witnesses did not see obj disappear as they apparently flew into overcast reported below them. It is possible that obj was planet Venus which was in NW, and movement of a/c mistaken for movement of planet.
