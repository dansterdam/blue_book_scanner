SUBJECT: Space Objects Reported from Argentina.
         C-305, June 14, 1962.

During May 1962 Argentine newspapers carried various accounts of luminous objects seen in the sky in the Provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and Mendoza, especially on the 13th, 20th, and 21st. From San Juan Province at approximately 31° 34' South Latitude and 69° 38' West Longitude, a metal fragment approximately 30 x 20 x 10 centimeters, carrying English and Spanish inscriptions, was found and mailed to the Embassy of the United States. During June and July various space objects have been brought to the Embassy's attention.

In these alleged objects were sent to various sectors of the local authorities in Mendoza, Cordoba, and Bahia Blanca in order to reach their destination and why. Norberto Bayo, not of the Consejo Pacifico Espacial of the National Space Commission reports July 25 that the organization does not know about these fragments. The Embassy does not offer any other but that he will collaborate with the Embassy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in such matters.

...A ways of dramatic UFO re-
ports came in from Argentina early last June. Several cigar-shaped or saucer-
shaped craft were seen almost simultaneously from three more than 1,000 miles
apart. Two responsible independent newspapers, La Prensa and La Nacion, quot-
ed reliable and correspondent reports. The UFOs were seen near San Juan, near
San Carlos de Bariloche, and near Comodoro Rivadavia by truck drivers, and policemen. The UFOs were moving more slowly than a
normal aircraft and in very calm, they were traveling from north to south, at a low
area, a white beam was seen on the ground. It does scarce to a high altitude,
followed by several other objects of a similar shape. They appeared to move
around on their own axis.

Argentina-May, June - 1962
They're having a flap down there. Flying
Saucers are being reported increasingly.
UFOs were sighted almost simultaneously
from places more than 1,000 miles apart.

Argentina-May 1962 (NICAP)
A flying saucer landed on
Pampas. Some people who saw
it said a woman, a wife, and a
ly and noticed small beings
on the ground around the
ship. The beings hastily re-
entered the UFO and took off.

In Santa Rosa on May 16, Mary saw over-
head six or seven moving objects, alternating briskly, advancing in perfect formation.
They appeared to move around their
own axis. The Buenos Aires Herald reported, "A woman in La Plata Province was
taken to a mental hospital suffering from
shock after seeing a mysterious machine
come out of a saucer, then "her" discovered
he was being watched, the "robot" confirmed the machine, and soon the machine disappeared at tremendous speed."

SPACE WORLD-Oct. 1962-Argentina
The SIGHTING in May 1962 caused
a sensation...photographs were taken,
landing and return traces were reported,
the Argentine government reported to the UN, etc. The
American public has heard nothing about. (Contributed by Richard Hall of NICAP)

May 21-26. The Argentine Government, on May 24, officially
reported a "flying saucer" landing in La Pampa at four numerous
sightings in five provinces. A Government broadcast said the UFO
was seen by a rancher and his wife. The woman, who had a close
view, said two robot-like figures emerged from the machine. Nothing
they were observed, they remained quietly took off. An
Argentine Air Force officer said experts confirmed that the ground
was scorched in an 18-foot circle. Credit NICAP for these two
recent-foreign sightings.

UFO PHOTOGRAPHED IN ARGENTINA

Cesar Domingo La Padula, Ariel Kapelusz, and Ernesto Jose Ind, students of the Institute of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics of the National University Observatory of Cordoba, sighted a UFO while on the terrace of Mr. Padula's home, attempting to adjust an antenna. They said the object was completely "circular" and that once during the sighting the shadow of the object fell on buildings. Padula does not maintain that the object is a "flying saucer" and adds nothing to the report except the above. The newspaper, "Cordoba" published the photos (see cut) on their front page, remarking: "Are they or are they not from another world, flying special missions over our planet?"

The newspaper, "La Voz del Interior," besides publishing on that occasion two of the photos and comments about them, confirm the sighting of the object with the added comment that corroborating witnesses watched the object from the Airport of Cordoba.

The time of day of the sighting and subsequent photographs, was 5:30 p.m. Doubt concerning the incident was expressed in the newspaper "Los Principios" in an interview with the photographer of the National Observatory of Cordoba, Mr. Julio Albarracin who said he gave no credence to the report, and that he felt it was the product of a "youthful mentality" (juvenile hoax). He also stated that the photos show an object that reflects a "strange light" from the underside and has a shadow from the upper side, the angles of the photo are contradictory and there are other details that make the whole incident suspicious.

However, the newspaper "Cordoba" said that members of the Institute decided to have the photographs analyzed by professional photographers who informed them the pictures were not fakes.

We are making inquiries to get prints from the original negative and additional testimony and details—if we are successful, more will be featured in coming issues.

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for April 28, 1962

Planet Venus Now Prominent
The planet Venus becomes increasingly prominent in May evening skies. Mercury is seen in the most favorable position of the year. James Stokey reports:

NOT ONLY is the planet Venus becoming more and more prominent in the evening skies, the moon of May slay along with Mercury is its most favorable period.

If you look just after sunset and even before the sky completely darkens, you will see a brilliant Venus, shining brightly. It is so bright that you can see it long before any other star or planet. About 10 degrees above the horizon, Venus will be visible around the western horizon.

With Venus is visible all month, you will be able to see Mercury only for about a week. May 15. That is the date of greatest eastern elongation, when it sets the longest time after sunset. During this period of twilight has faded entirely, you will see Mercury slightly below Venus and farther to the right. Mercury will then be brighter than most of the sky, making the sky look about 10 p.m., your kind of standard time, on May 15.

At the middle of the month and two hours earlier at the end, (add one hour for daylight saving time) even on the 15th, you can see before then yet Venus is shown to be the brightest object in the constellation of Taurus. This is its position at the middle of May later in the month it will move into the next-door constellation of Gemini.

The most prominent stars of May shine in the southern half of the sky. High in the southwest is Leo, the lion, in which Venus a conspicuous figure is at the first magnitude Regulus at the end of the handle. The table is as follows: ancient star map, Deneb, to the left, marks his tail.

Near to Leo is Virgo, the virgin, with another star of the first magnitude called Spica. And above the eastern end of Virgo stands Bootes, the herdsman, with bright Arcturus.

Several other stars of the first magnitude also appear on our maps. In Gemini, Pollux while next door to the right, in Auriga, the charioteer, is Capella. On the lower left of Gemini, in the constellation Orion, the hunter, is Betelgeuse. In the west, Bellatrix is Capella, the swan, with Deneb, a bright star considered, diamond because of its very low altitude. This is also true of Antares, in Scorpius, this season, with a

miles, and Venus at about 67,000,000 miles, that of Mercury is only 36,000,000 miles.

Venus, of course, being closer to the sun in every way, never appears in the opposite part of the sky as the sun. It swings first to the east of the sun, then to the west, always remaining relatively close to the sun, or in the morning, before sunrise. But at its farthest from the sun, it can remain visible, as it will this summer, well after the sky is dark.

Mercury Sets at Twilight
And we with Mercury. At best it is only about the time twilight is over, and its visibility depends on the time of year as much as the position of the planet, which is it gets farthest to the east or west of the sun. When the time of greatest elongation approaches near in the spring, or it gets past its greatest elongation, perhaps as much as two hours after sunset.

But when an eastern elongation occurs in the fall, it may be just as far from the sun but in much farther south, and then it may get only half an hour or so after sunset. That is why this month of May gives the best opportunity of the year to see the planet.

Of all the planets visible to the naked eye, Mercury is the smallest. Whereas the earth's diameter is 7,926 miles, that of Mercury is about 3,100 miles. A circle with a diameter of this size would just about fit in the Atlantic Ocean. It would barely touch the western tip of Africa and the northeastern coast of South America, at

SCIENCE FIELDS

Space Agency Launches
Science Training Program

A NEW PROGRAM to train scientists
and engineers in space life sciences is
being launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

James E. Webb, NASA administrator,
announced the program will begin next fall
in a speech at the Institute of Environmental Sciences. The training will be aimed at
graduate students and young scientists during the first year of the experiment.

The U.S. space effort is aimed at making
peaceful use of space technology and exploring the solar system with more and
more sophisticated scientific instruments.
The program will help increase the numbers of graduates in science and engineering are needed, Webb noted, to support
critically short supply, he noted, is "realizing."

Students chosen for the NASA training
program will receive $2,400 a year for 12
months of graduate study, with an additional $1,000 a year according to the practice of individual universities. The universities will be reimbursed for tuition, fees and
other expenses, as the program. Cost of the
program for the first group of trainees is
expected to be about $500,000.

Participating universities include: Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y.; University of Maryland; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Michigan; University
of Chicago; University of Minnesota; State
University of Iowa; Rice University; Baylor College of Medicine; University of Houston, Texas; and the University of California at Los Angeles.

PUBLIC HEALTH

Alaska Caribou Has High
Level of Strontium-90

RADIOACTIVE STRONTIUM-90, a
byproduct of nuclear explosions, is more concentrated in
Alaska caribou than in any other food
studied, a survey shows.

The caribou, a native North American
animal, has a staple in the diet of Eskimos
from the northern tundra have
been found to carry 11 to 20 times the level
of strontium-90 found in other foods.

The Eskimos have four times the strontium content of the average for the world
population of the north temperate zones.

[Continuing story paraphrased by Dr.
Arthur R. Schulert in Science, 136-616, 1962]

Science News Letter for April 28, 1962

to the U.S. Navy Medical Research Unit
No. 5, Camp Lejeune, N.C.

Dr. Schulert's findings may have some
bearing on fallout dangers to humans, and
they were made in a survey of radioactive
explosions under the Atomic Energy Commission, on the northwest coast of Alaska. The
Project Chariot explosions were a harbor is part of the Plowshare program
for developing peaceful uses of nuclear
explosions.

The Atomic Energy Commission is now
conducting studies in the environment and
the interrelationship of humans, plants and
animals as a preliminary to deciding
whether Project Chariot should be undertaken, but no actual tests have been made
locally. Final decision must come from the
President.

The Committee for Nuclear Information
in St. Louis charged last year that fallout
dangers from Chariot were "potential
hazards" and called for AEC to make a
chain of plants, animals and men.

Most of the fallout found in Alaska
comes from Russian tests.

ASTRONOMY

Birth Rate of Small Stars
Now Lower Than Long Ago

ONE BIRTH RATE is less, is lower
today than long ago, according to
work in the Milky Way galaxy, the gigantic
wheel of billions of stars in which the
earth and other planets of the universe exist.

The new work is by a radio telescope
survey of small stars in the Milky Way
galaxy. As a whole, therefore, most of the
stars seem to have been formed a long
time ago.

The galaxy, as a whole, therefore, must
have been a much brighter object in the
past than it is now.

The work was done by Dr. Maarten
Schmidt, astronomer of Mt. Wilson and
Palomar Observatories, reported jointly by
the California Institute of Technology,
Pasadena, Calif., and the Carnegie Institution of Washington.

MEDICINE

Overall Cure Rate Now
One in Three for Cancer

THERE IS GOOD news from the American Cancer Society—the overall cure rate
from cancer is now one in three, due to
surgery, X-ray, chemotherapy, drugs and
radiation.

This compares with one in seven cured
25 years ago.

Also the death rate from cancer of the
nation has dropped from 191.3 per
100,000 women, half of what it was 25
years ago.

Increasing research is helping conquer
clinical aspects, viruses and immunology
in cancer, the Society reported.

PUBLIC HEALTH

Safety From Fallout Seen
For Breast-fed Babies

MOTHERS who can breastfeed their
babies have protection from strontium-90
fallout dangers, a newly formed committee
of environmental health experts concluded.
The pediatric committee of the AMA also
drew attention to the hazards of strontium-89.

The pediatricians also called attention to
the hazards of strontium-89 and iodine-131.
Strontium-89 occurs in the some general
fallout pattern as strontium-90. However,
its half-life is shorter. Iodine-131 has a
decaying almost entirely before 8 days.

The short half-life of iodine-131, 8 days,
limits the problem of radioactive contamination of food by this element to about two
months following any extreme contamination incident. This means the danger of
iodine-131 carries a danger of possible cancer-causing action on the thyroid gland
because of the thyroid's unusual capability
to concentrate this element.

Radioactive strontium-90 collects in the
bone. The present strontium-90 content of
the human body is considered to be incapable of inducing harmful effects in humans, children or adults, the report says.

The pediatricians pointed out that laboratory methods for the removal of strontium-90 from milk are now being tested.

Dr. Schulert noted that strontium accumulated from the human body immediately
will likely burden of the radioactive element increase more slowly than that of the
environment.

The additional safety factor that much
as can provide through breast feeding is
one to be carefully pondered by pediatric
authorities.

SUBJECT: UFO - CORDOBA, ARGENTINA

ANALYST: MAJ Quintanilla     PT: Capt Benson     DATE: 21 Dec 67

Photo analysis was requested for a print forwarded to FTD via the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. The print displayed an image of a circular disc-shaped object with a serrated outer edge. There are no images on this print, the background is unidentifiable, and there are no details of the observation provided. From a technical viewpoint, the print was made from a very dirty and heavily damaged negative and is an enlargement of unknown quality. The original negative is not available.

Considering these factors, it is felt that there is insufficient data available to allow for an attempt at any concrete analysis of the object.

Here is the text from the document:

Cayenne, French Guiana. To the north, it would reach N. Lat. 56, a Newfoundland. Just as the moon always lies in this hemisphere, so does Mercury always keep the same side toward this sun. In the middle of that side, where the sun always is high overhead, the temperature rises to as much as 700 degrees Fahrenheit—enough to melt lead or tin. But there is no atmosphere, no air currents carry warmth around to the dark side. Here the temperature is probably not much above the absolute zero of minus 273 degrees Fahrenheit.

Mercury, therefore, is a lithermonic world. As the most distant planet, does not get to cold. At 5.6 billion miles from the sun, the rays from that body are very feeble. But every part of Mercury's surface is periodically illuminated and slightly warmed.

Actually, we can see a little more than half the moon's surface. These are "librations," which permit us to look around our edge of the planet. The same with Mercury, where the sun always shines, and there is no tone where the sun does not shine. It never travels over yet to Mercury, this is darkness where they would land.

Seattle—Another Fire Ball

On May 19, 1962 at 9:15 PM, Seattle, Washington residents were startled by a huge yellow fireball which appeared to burn out slowly in the sky. Witnesses described various points of observation from various points in Oregon, Washington and California. It was reportedly seen over cracked that near the Pacific Ocean went either north or south. Two persons in a Seattle reported many people saw the spectacular sight, many moving about, a bright light moving from west to east. The APRO May 29 issue, said that there was an object which "appeared to have been a U.S. Balloon called Skyhook 1, may have been the same first spotted yesterday at Jupiter. According to UP, the article continued, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., later sent out a request that satellite tracking stations around the world help follow "suspected" (and) unspecified bright satellites.

Not An Airplane Or Meteor!
Aerial Phenomenon Viewed

THE JOURNAL-GAZETTE
Wednesday, May 23, 1962

DEFIANCE, Ohio--Certain that it was not a conventional airplane or a meteor, Prof. Charles A. Maney, science professor at the Defiance College, Tuesday continued his investigation of the aerial phenomenon several persons viewed near Defiance.

Maney is a member of the National Investigations Committee of "Aerial Phenomena" with headquarters in Washington, D.C., and co-author of a book on "Incidents of Flying Objects" commonly referred to as "flying saucers."

Prof. Maney said the object was in the vicinity for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. He said it changed from fiery blue to brilliant yellow in color, moved swiftly, changed its course radically and at times hovered almost motionless.

He said he not only viewed it with the naked eye but through binoculars.

Don Reimund and family along with the family of a neighbor were the other persons who viewed Prof. Maney's interest in them.

Summoned him to their home on the Canal Road, west of Defiance, the object, according to Reimund was seen by him for about 20 minutes before Prof. Maney actually arrived. Then returned and Prof. Maney and others viewed it.

Defiance, Ohio--May 20, 1962--8:20 P.M.
Terry Maney, head of the Physics department at Defiance College, reported seeing a UFO. He was in the company of Mrs. Terry, Mr. & Mrs. Reimund and their daughters, and other couple was present.

Before Maney joined the group, the Reimunds had observed the UFO from 200 min. The object was a brilliant fiery blue. Procedure Maney observed the object through 7 x 50 binoculars for 10 min as it traveled northwest approximately 10°. The object stopped, moved for 5-6 secs., reversed its direction and was lost to vision in the sky. A change of color from brilliant yellow was also reported.

Four teenagers and a state highway patrolman in Norwalk, Ohio, saw a UFO which traveled about 200 feet above the ground. The maneuver was seen to change color from orange to blue to red. It looked like a flat iron on the bottom, and had a triangular shape. They turned a spotlight on it, and it took off at high speed and disappeared. The statement was made by a similar observer, few days earlier, by Prof. Charles Maney of Defiance College.

Defiance, Ohio, Maney, who has recently co-authored a book dealing with UFO sightings, said by co-incidence or otherwise, been in the area of several local sightings, constituting a brief local "flap" was made on May 20th....

I could see it quite clearly," he stated. "It was round, with protrusions like antennae. It must have been making about 500 knots. I have never seen anything like it before."

First Officer J.P. Murphy confirmed the captain's description. Pendleton said he had radioed British Airways Control "because the object might be a danger to traffic in the area." The RAF and the Air Ministry are investigating.

...On May 21st a strange globe-shaped machine was encountered by an Irish International Airlines plane bound for Brussels. According to Capt. Cordon Penkley, the plane was like antennae. The sighting was confirmed by First Officer J.P. Murphy.

Great Britain.........5/21/62
The sighting took place in Southern England - Wales.
Capt. Cordon Pendleton and his plane's First Officer, Peter Murphy, saw a saucer flying at 500 mph or more.
The object passed at about 3,000 feet below us at a bout 14,000 feet. The object was brown, irregularly shaped, and with antennae. Its size of the UFO was smaller than a Viscount."

Extract from Flying Saucer Review, Vol. Aug 62

Two Aer Lingus pilots see saucer

CAPTAIN Gordon Parrinder, who was flying a Viscount airliner from London to Brussels when he first saw the object, said: "I have never seen anything like it. The object remained nearly 5,000 ft below us and seemed to have always been somewhat ahead of us. If it had been a large saucer, I would have seen the shape."

Neither the sixty passengers nor the crew members saw the object.

Captain Parrinder, who was flying at 19,000 ft over the west of Ireland, said the object was about 500 m.p.h. over Dunmore, on May 28. A daily later controllers and over Waterford area will trying to find an explanation.

Later reports from the (Irish) papers state that the sighting occurred over Brosna, Wales and near Farndon, Somerset. The Air Ministry, according to the independent newspaper, said that the object was probably a weather balloon. But Captain Parrinder said it was not a balloon.

* The direct route from Brussels to Cork would certainly present a more interesting route than just Farndon.

May 25--Mason contractor Frank DiNanno of Woburn, along with
three other eyewitnesses, sighted a cold looking dark
gray circular shiny maneuvering object over Burlington, Mass.
Four Polaroid Camera photographs were taken of the object,
which made a swishing sound as it maneuvered.

The next incident was more spectacular, as four Woburn men
watched and photographed four times a circular Gary Panzee-
type object over Burlington, Massachusetts on May 29, 1962.
They used a Polaroid Camera with 3000 speed Polaroid Land Picture
Film, Type 47. The strange unknown object moved from the
direction of Hanscom Air Force Base at Bedford.

ARGENTINA 1962
A massive UFO visitation
by Gordon W. Creighton

1962 was a year of remarkable UFO activity over the Argentine. The following is a summary of a very large batch of newspaper clippings just received in England.

On Sunday, May 13, 1962, at 4:45 a.m. a flight of 20 UFOs, displaying the most varied colours, were seen by numerous people in Rio Cuarto (Province of Cordoba). One saucer seemed to fall out of formation and come down like a shooting star to a distance of some 300 metres from an eyewitness's car. It could then be seen that it was a great fiery ball some 30 metres in diameter. Suddenly, from one side of this ball there shot out a great fiery globe. These then lined up behind the large ball and together all five flew away, keeping the same formation.

Indeed, during the 24 hours from midnight to Saturday 12 to Sunday 13 of May, UFO were seen all over the Argentine, and landings occurred at several places, such as Olavarria (Cordoba Province) and Zapala (Neuquen). One newspaper said that this vast flood of sightings might well mark a new era with regard to the UFO problem, a key-day in the history of Mankind. The paper added that throughout the country had had a profound emotional impact.

June 4. A UFO was seen over Olavarria (Province of Buenos Aires), and newspapers called it a "space-ship". On June 10, the paper La Nacion (Buenos Aires) reported that UFOs had been seen three times since the beginning of the year in Catamarca and that the Government of that Province had called upon the local astronomers.

Reports of landings

On June 13 the Buenos Aires paper El Mundo reported that there had been so many saucer sightings over the Bahia Blanca area that the Chief of Police in La Plata Bahia had summoned all eyewitnesses to appear before him and give statements. Some of the reports were of landings. The paper described the events as sensational and said the UFOs were visitors from space.

During the night of June 15, at Mar del Plata, numerous people saw a UFO, while at the night of June 16, at 9:30 p.m. flying in from the direction of the South Atlantic. The whole craft was vividly illuminated and carried, in addition, three very bright lights (red in the centre, yellow on the right, and green on the left). The apparent size of the cigar was greater than the diameter of the Moon.

At 8:30 p.m. on June 18 a huge UFO, the apparent size of a football, passed at great speed over Cordoba and created a sensation.

A "cigars" overhead La Plata

During the night of June 21 many residents of La Plata telephoned the police and newspapers saying that a cigar was overhead and had been seen in the area several times during the past three days. Most observers said it was flying round in circles at great speed, periodically disappearing and reappearing. The paper La Tribuna, reporting this particular case, one of the Tucuman paper went on to say, could not fail to be connected with the growing crisis of our times. With every passing day they were revealing themselves more openly, so that "soon nobody will any longer be able to remain in doubt as to their presence". Then, away the veil of confusion behind which, when awake, people had hidden the supreme truth regarding their existence.

On June 23, La Razon (Buenos Aires) reported that on the previous day, in a perfectly clear sky, an extraordinary luminous body had passed rapidly from North-East to South-West over the town of Salta in the far north of the country, an area where so many UFO had already been seen. The paper also reported that from around midnight of June 27-28 until noon on June 28 a constant rain of fine

aul-like dust had poured down on Salta and
vicinity. Many had at first thought it was snow.
At about 2 p.m. on July 19, the whole body of
over 150 workmen at the Auto Union DKW Car
Plant at Sauce Viejo (near Santa Fé, which is
North-West of Buenos Aires) saw a cigar moving
rapidly towards the North-East. It seemed to be at
a height of about 1,000 metres and gave out frequent flashing flashes. It was silent and left no
trail, crossed and rapidly disappeared. Observers
said there were type of craft had been seen there
several times before.

Three UFOs.
At 7.45 a.m. on July 27, 1962 schoolchildren in
the town of Villa Tunuyán saw three UFOs passing over a good from north to south. They gave off
a bluish light. Schoolteachers who were present
added that the objects were discs and emitted
blinding silvery flashes.

On August 1, according to a Tucumán paper,
the driver of a vehicle was paced by a luminous
object. The witness, an engineer named Ricardo
W. S-----, resident on Calle Rioja y Colón in the
town of Gálvarez (a few miles south of Buenos
Aires) was accompanied by his wife. At 8.30
p.m. in a trip back at 9.45 a.m. from Olmos
to Villa Urquiza, Sauce, suddenly the light
behind seemed to indicate that some other vehicle
was about to pass. But the light was fluorescent,
and so bright that they could not even see the rear
end of their own truck. Suddenly they found
themselves right beneath a vast cylindrical craft
traveling in the same direction as they were. In
addition to the intense fluorescent light it was
giving off reddish sparks. Señor Somer made
several attempts, but in vain, to escape from it by
accelerating, and so they continued to travel along
the road for less than 15 kilometers until they
reached La Atalaya, where the cigar turned away
abruptly across country and vanished. Señor
Somer (an engineer by profession, he it noted, and
no doubt an Argentine-German) declared to the
newspaper that such a craft could unquestionably
only be extraterrestrial.

Saucer lands on aerodrome
On August 2, various papers carried detailed
accounts of a saucer landing on the aerodrome at
Gambá Punat landing field (Corrientes, far northeast tip of Argentina). The airport manager,
Señor Luis Jiménez, explained that he had been
warned by his staff that an unannounced aircraft
was about to land. He ran out on to the field and
was astonished to see a huge object which, after
falling to get any reply to their signals, he and his
staff prepared for a landing, but when the object
came down they were astonished to see that it was
no aeroplane at all but a completely spherical body

that hung, hovering and also revolving, a few feet
above the same spot on the runway for some three
to four minutes emitting all the while powerful
blue, green, and orange flashes. Then, as the
astonished officials approached, it climbed and
vanished at staggering speed. The incident was
once reported to the authorities and an intensive
investigation was launched. Discussing the case,
the press made it quite clear that the UFO could
only be extraterrestrial. La Razón (Buenos Aires)
said: "We do not believe the true explanation of
these occurrences can be kept secret much longer."
Los Andes, a paper published in the Andean province
of Mendoza, voiced the same view, and another
important northern paper had the following significant comment: "The arrival of this interplanetary
craft on an aerodrome in the Province of Corrientes
- a fact that can in no wise be disputed, given the
manner of its appearance and the calibre of the
eyewitnesses - serves to strengthen the view that
there may be Space Peoples' bases somewhere in
our country, in view of the great number of recent
sightings." The paper went on to compare this
Gambá Punat landing with the famous case of the
saucer that landed on the runway of the airport at
Marignane, France, on September 27, 1952.

Pedro Atilip's experience
Three days later, on August 5, 1962, at 1.45 a.m.,
a truck-driver named Pedro Atilip was out on a
he was driving towards Mar del Plata. Suddenly
his engine stalled for no perceptible reason. He got
out with a lantern to see what was wrong. The
section of road between Las Armas and Pirán) was
deserted. Suddenly, to his astonishment, he found
that his engine was working again, and at the same
moment he became aware of a tremendous
luminosity coming from a huge cigar-shaped object
that was lying about 300 metres from him, either
on the ground or slightly above it. The machine
was giving off a powerful orange glow intermixed with flashes of pale violet and bright green.
For a few moments he stood there dumbfounded,
and then saw the object rise and vanish at astonishing speed towards the West, now giving off a clear
white light.

In the course of August, 1962, there were many
press reports of sightings at Concepción de las
Sierras, San Javier, and various other localities in
Misiones Province (a wedge of Argentine territory
running up between Paraguay and Brazil). On one
particular evening, people in town of the few towns
in this region saw a large cigar-shaped object towards towards Brazil. The objects were silvery,
gray, and showed vivid red lights. They were
elongated, surmounted by round cupolas.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

in various papers in August, 1962, Señor Vicente
A. Bordoli, a truck-driver living at Mar del Plata,
stated that when driving southward along National
Highway No. 3 which skirts the South Atlantic
coast of the Argentine, he and his son Hugo
Bordoli had frequently seen strange luminous craft
both entering and leaving the sea. In his view
these craft, veritable flotillas of them, are controlled
by certain camouflaged craft from underwater bases,
perhaps from large submarine mother-craft. Señor
Bordoli concluded his statement by saying: "At a
point near the lighthouse of San Pedro, in the Gulf of
San Matias there is a flying saucer base. These
happenings are common knowledge throughout a
large region of Patagonia, where it is a regular and
quite a normal thing for people to be heard speaking of the Martians."

"Soviet submarines"

Readers will recall the fiasco of February, 1960,
when the Argentine Navy lost an enormous amount
of face in trying (over a period of nearly two weeks)
to sink or capture two "submarines"—allegedly
Soviet, of course—in the Golfo Nuevo, or Nueva
Gulf. As the sketch map shows, this gulf is close to
the Gulf of San Matias. Señor Bordoli's story now
throws an enormous amount of light on that
episode. Especially as it was reported in the
Argentine and British press at the time that these
sauces were involved and had been seen entering
and leaving the sea in the Golfo Nuevo.

The current batch of reports contains nothing
further for the period from August to December
1962. But on December 11, at 2 a.m. in the morning, a dramatic event took place near a town called
Chumbicha, between Catamarca and Córdoba, in
the Andean region of North-East Argentina.
Accompanied by his wife and son, Dr. Godofredo
Lucero Galeano, Director of the Sarmiento
Observatory at Córdoba, was driving to Córdoba.
The moon was full. When they had
gone some 7 kilometers from Chumbicha, and some
fifteen minutes after passing through the small
town of Chumbicha, they saw, lined up in military
order at the foot of the mountains and not more
than 200 or 700 metres distant, seven brilliantly
luminous saucers. Dr. Cáceres stopped the car
and they watched, watching, until, shortly afterwards, the squadron of saucers rose straight up and
flew away at great speed, leaving behind them
trails of intense luminosity.

On December 22, the Buenos Aires papers
reported that a day or so previously, a saucer had
landed at 2.15 a.m. on one of the main runways of
the International Airport at Ezeiza, near Buenos
Aires. The machine had remained there, sitting on

giant Pan-American DC8 passenger plane. The
principal witness interviewed by the Press was
Señor Horacio Alora, officer in charge in the
Flight Control Tower. He said that he and his
colleague Señor José Bestuci had watched as the
intensely luminous UFO had landed right in the
centre of the runway at a distance of some 200
metres from the Control Tower. At that distance
the object had the appearance of a football.
When it took off again, it went straight up to an
estimated height of 500 or 600 metres, and then
made off at prodigious speed. The Buenos Aires
League had in fact been getting ready to bring in
the Pan-American DC8, and the behaviour of the
UFO was consequently something that they had
had to watch most carefully. One of the Buenos
Aires' newspapers pointed out, in commenting on
this case, that such a landing on an important
international airfield proved clearly that the saucers
were no longer content to land merely in out-ofthe-way places. They were now coming down
boldly on the principal arteries of the country. The
Argentine Air Force was busy collecting all available information about this and many other UFO landings.

An astonishing situation

All this is just a résumé which I have made from
one batch of clippings sent to me by a bank official
in the Northern City of Tucumán. He says he has
been covering the past ten years, but can submit
only these few reports at present, as these clippings
are "sparse". He adds that he can supply a
summary of all his main material. Here, I submit,
is an astonishing situation. For some years past
whole of the Argentine has been subjected to a most
intensive visitation, and there are evidently bases
there, both on land and in the sea. The subject is
by now common knowledge, it seems, to most
Argentines. Yet the Press has been very cautious
that have appeared from time to time in the
press about these events. When have the people of
this country been able to learn about it all?
Absolutely nothing. When enquiries were made of
the Argentine Embassy in London at the end of
1962, the replies given by their Press Attaché and
Air Attaché showed clearly that they both knew
quite well what was going on. They even supplied
me with a list of newspapers to which we might
write. This was done. An additional enquiry to
the Argentine Embassy in London brought no
further light. Since then, there has been silence,
once results. Since then, three has been silence,
Have the Argentine authorities, or someone else,
intervened to suppress any further replies to my
enquiry?
