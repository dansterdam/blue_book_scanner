The image contains a diagram with an angular trajectory line and a circular object in the top right corner. The diagram appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the curve where the object was closest to the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _____________________
b. Color _____________________

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trail or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
