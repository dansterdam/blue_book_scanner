11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer for two nights saw a strange object in the SW sky. The object was an extremely bright red orange then dimmed in color to a yellow to an brightening and dimming again. At one time the object looked like the moon, but there was a dark wide band bisecting it. On both occasions the object was stationary in the SW sky. The object appeared brighter than the sin or the moon (full). On both occasions the witness did not see the object disappear. The object was viewed for various periods of time and then the witness stopped looking.

On one occasion the witness heard an unusual noise. On the 22 Sept 66, two moon was on an azimuth of 228 deg and at an elevation of 14 deg. On 24 Sept, the moon was on an azimuth of 258 deg, elevation of 06 deg.

Sightings in latter Sep 66

Mrs.
Spring Valley, Ohio

Mrs. observed several unidentified objects in the latter part of September. she waited to inform us because she thought she might see something in the newspapers of similar sightings. However, after reading about barium cloud releases she decided that she would like to report her sighting. Therefore, three FFD Forms 164 were forwarded to Mrs. on 1 Nov 66 per conversation with her on 1 Nov.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    16    November    1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This object on Sept. 22, 1966 -- late -- I would like to say the on Sept. 26 at 8:30 A.M. following the sighting today on a brilliant object in sky. I was awakened from a sound sleep for what reason - I don't know. I didn't know how long I wait as I heard a sound like nothing I had ever heard before. It started in as a humming sound, a very low buzzing. I started crossing to am intense burn, going so high in intensity of sound, that it gave me the feeling it had better stop or something would burst. I remember it to have pure intense power. If I remember correctly I heard this three times, one night after the other.

I was not at all frightened with what I saw, but friends asked me if I had investigated by looking out to see if I could see anything other than this intense humming sound like a desperate sound. But I must admit I didn't go to investigate. I am a coward, being alone and I was only too glad that whatever it was left & disappeared.

This noise was not less and negligible or pushy type noise some going up & down in cylinders. I will say the noise came from the last direction I had previously made two sightings of same thing.

As I heard many what happened (many not to me) I waited a month or more before reporting it and know more people are ridiculing for the observations.

But, I finally thought I had a duty to report it to authorities. Signed [redacted]
