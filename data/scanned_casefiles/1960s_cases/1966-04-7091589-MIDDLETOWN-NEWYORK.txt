Transcription of the text in the document:

"This particular object was observed for 8-10 minutes. It was quite large, estimated to be between 40-50 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a greenish color and seemed to have a row of lights around the perimeter. The object moved about in a jerky, erratic manner, not like any conventional aircraft. It made no sound that could be heard. The object was observed by 3 adult witnesses, whose reliability is considered very good. Their observations indicate a serious object that cannot be readily explained. Mrs. [redacted] in phone message."

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Mr. Edward Bernard, 11 Connor Street, Middletown, New York, reported that he observed something which appeared to be a flying object on the evening of 25 April. He described the object as moving in a circular motion and that it was quite bright, lighting up the area. The object remained in view for 2-3 minutes when it disappeared rapidly from sight.

The distance of the object from the observer was estimated to be 5 miles and the elevation was approximately 45 degrees.
