Sirs:

Last evening, Sept 14th, at 9.35 pm (Barbados Standard Time) I was in a semi-dark room facing a window a few degrees west of north and witnessed a very brilliant and twinkling blue-green object, similar in appearance to one of the large "stars" circled by a fireworks skyrocket, but much larger, rapidly falling towards the earth - NOT across the sky. There was no "comet tail" trailing.

I am bringing this to your attention as I had read of the 30 lb piece of metal which fell in Wisconsin about 5 days ago and was judged to be a part of Sputnik IV and that you are interested in hearing of such falling objects. I am unable to report where the object landed as no reports have been circulated. Position is 21 miles from north to south, and I saw it from the south end of the island and have no idea how far away it was. It just appeared to fall vertically.

(Signed)

Scott AFB, Ill.

1. Reference letter, your Headquarters, Subject: Request for Interview of [redacted], dated 23 November 1962.

2. In accordance with referenced letter and paragraph 15 of AFR 200-2, dated 14 September 1959, the following information is submitted:

On 26 November 1962, Mr. W. H. LEA, Postmaster, Steelville, Missouri, was interviewed by Special Agent BROOKS, OSI Detachment 1303, Scott AFB, Illinois. LEA stated that he has been acquainted with Mr. and Mrs [redacted] for many years and that Mr. [redacted] was an alcoholic until about one year ago, when he was involved in a serious automobile accident and seriously injured. LEA started that, in his opinion, Mrs [redacted] mental capability has been impaired, possibly as a result of her husband's excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages; however, to the best of his knowledge, she has not received treatment for any mental or nervous disorder. LEA said he was not aware of any other persons who have sighted or reported Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) and, to his knowledge, such incidents have never become a topic of conversation. As Steelville has a population of approximately 1200 persons, he felt that if such reports had been made, it would have come to his attention.

On 26 November 1962, Mr. [redacted], co-owner, Lumber Company, residing at 601 First Street, Steelville, Missouri, was interviewed by Special Agent BROOKS. Mr. [redacted] stated that he has known Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] for many years. Mr. [redacted] advised that approximately one year ago Mrs. [redacted] started reporting to him and his family the sighting of numerous UFOs, described as big green balls, flying at tree-top level, on numerous occasions. Mr. [redacted] stated that his family have their residence at a high, at least advantageous, point in the community to observe the objects; however, at no time did he or any member of his family observe any objects, although Mrs. [redacted] would point out that the objects were present. Mr. [redacted] was somewhat convinced that something pertaining to the [redacted] was going to happen to them and
