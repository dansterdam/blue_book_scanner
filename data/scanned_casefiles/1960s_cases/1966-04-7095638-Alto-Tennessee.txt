SWAMP AREA

ORIGINAL PAGE OF LIGHTING

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a landscape with overgrown vegetation in the foreground, some open fields, and trees in the background. There is a compass rose indicating cardinal directions, and an arrow pointing to something in the scene. The text "SWAMP AREA" is written on the image.

I apologize, but I cannot detect any legible text on this page. The image appears to be a blank or very faded document page with some slight variations in grayscale and a few minor marks or artifacts, but no discernible text is visible.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

- page 5 -

There is no legible text in this image. The photograph appears to be a black and white landscape scene showing an open field with some brush or vegetation in the foreground, utility poles in the background, and trees and horizon in the distance. There are also some faint linear markings at the top of the image that look like they might be part of the document or scanning process.


- page 6 -

There is no legible text in this image. The photograph appears to be a black and white landscape scene showing a field with overgrown vegetation in the foreground, and two large spherical objects or structures in the background, along with some trees and a long thin line (possibly a wire or pole) at the top of the image.


- page 7 -

There is very little legible text on this page. At the bottom of the page, there appears to be some faint markings or text, but they are too blurry and indistinct to read with certainty. The page appears to be a mostly blank document page from a Project Blue Book file, with some slight variations in shading and a few small specks or marks, but no clear readable text.


- page 8 -

The page contains three black and white landscape images showing similar scenes of roads or highways with vegetation and poles/structures on the sides. Each image has a compass rose/directional indicator (N, S, E, W) next to it. The images appear to be different views or perspectives of the same location. At the bottom right of the page, there is a handwritten notation "110-14".


- page 9 -

The only text I can clearly see on this page is "67 --&7" in the top right corner of the document. The rest of the page appears to be a blank or very faintly scanned white/gray page with some minor artifacts or scanning imperfections.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AEYS
SUBJECT: Additional Information on UFO Report
(Msg. AEX 06521 Apr 66)

TO: FTD (Project Blue Book)
ATTN: Lt Marley

1. Reference telephone conversation between Dr. J. A. Hynek, your office, and Sgt Hatmaker on 20 Dec 1966 regarding UFO sighting on 5 Apr 1966.

2. An interview was conducted on 27 Dec 1966 with Mr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] was not available.

3. Photographs were taken of area which shows power lines and terrain of land. (Atch #1)

4. An illustrator discussed the sighting with Mr. [redacted] and his conception of incident will be forwarded when completed.

5. Elaboration on information previously furnished in initial report:

a. Item A (2)
Mr. [redacted] was asked about the size of object at initial sighting. After experimenting with objects at arm's length, he came to the conclusion that two fingers, folded in half, would cover object.

b. Item A (8)
Mr. [redacted] was not able to furnish a specific reference. He was asked if he had previously heard power lines make noises such as a hum. Mr. [redacted] replied, "Yes, but this was a high-frequency hum which was a louder noise than the power lines could make at that distance. Real loud."

c. Item B (4)
Object moved east parallel with power lines until it changed its course to the south. This will be shown in illustrator's conception when completed.


- page 16 -

d. Item B (6)
Object was visible from three to five minutes from initial sighting until after object turned south.

e. Item C (2)
Mr. [redacted] stated that the telescope could not be focused on object.

f. Item H
Swampy area is circled in Atch #1. The size of this area is one to two acres.

g. Item K (livestock and other animals were disturbed)
Animals           Reaction
Cows              Mooing
Dogs              Barking - Howling
Ponies            Neighing

6. Mr. [redacted] gave the following sequence of events:
"I was driving along about 12 o'clock at night, tired and sort of sleepy and asleep. 'What the Hell is that over there.' I stopped the car and we got out. We said a couple of words (frankly I was scared) and I said let's go get dad. As if this thing heard me, it started moving. I have an Oldsmobile Cutlass with a four speed and it runs pretty good. Before I could get it wound out, this thing had a good lead on me. We lost sight of it at that little knoll over there, but as soon as we got around that knoll, we saw it again and did not lose sight of it again until it seemed to mix with the stars. My dad didn't see it until it was over those towers."

7. It is again reiterated that Mr. [redacted] seems reliable and sincere about this sighting.

8. Information requested in your letter dated 21 Dec 1966 will be forwarded when completed.

1. FTD Forms 164 were delivered on 20 Jan 67 to the people
concerned in this sighting. They will be forwarded when
returned to this office. No response to date.

2. [Illegible text] and [illegible text] were together when object
was first sighted.

3. On 20 Jan 67, [illegible text] was asked about the duration
of disturbance to livestock. He said, "I noticed the
disturbance approximately one hour, but the neighbors told
me that the animals had been disturbed for a long time, maybe
four or five hours. They also told me that livestock had
broken out of their fenced lots."

4. Mr. [illegible text] estimated that the object passed within one-half
mile of the animals or maybe closer at some points along the
route.

5. The attached photograph (Atch #1) was taken from the point
of initial sighting. An illustrator conceptualized the object
was placed on the photograph. This photograph was shown to
[illegible text] and he indicated that this was what he saw.
He also stated that the colors seemed to fluctuate.

6. Attachment #2 is photographs taken from point of initial
sighting along the route of object. The artist's
conception of the UFO was placed on these photographs.
