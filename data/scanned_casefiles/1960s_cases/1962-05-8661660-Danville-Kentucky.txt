SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: FTD (TD-2)

The following information received from OSI District 12, Chanute AFB, Illinois is furnished for your information and any action deemed appropriate.

"At 1255 hours, 25 May 1962, S/A WILLIAM T. TILLER, Chief, Security Branch, FBI Field Office, Indianapolis, Indiana, telephonically contacted OSI Detachment 1201, Bakalar AFB, Indiana, and advised that a contact at his office on 24 May 1962, reporting an unidentified flying object, stated he was driving along U.S. Highway 100, between Loretto and Bardstown, Kentucky, at approximately 1500 hrs, 7 May 1962, when he observed a bright red object with a long, white cone-tail go down and disappear in a valley, west of the above location. The object was unidentified and modified the Bardstown, Kentucky Police Department who apparently inquired the Bardstown area and showed no interest. I RECOMMEND advised that the above information sounded rational and concerned when reporting the above information."
