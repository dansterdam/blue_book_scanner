Attention: Office of Information
Selfridge AFB, Michigan 48045

Sir:

Up to the night of this report, I have taken little stock on reports of unidentified flying objects. The fact that this sighting occurred over a long period of time; and the officers, as well as others, had time to obtain field glasses for viewing surely adds considerable substance to the many reports over the last few years.

I would appreciate any information you might have or acquire relative to these flying objects.

Respectfully,
[Signature]
