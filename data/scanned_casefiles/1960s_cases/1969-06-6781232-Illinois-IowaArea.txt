[In section 16, handwritten response is "Lowly"]

[Checkboxes and form fields partially filled out, but most are blank]

In section 12 (description of phenomenon), handwritten text reads:

"Object was light appearance. It was self-luminous. Color noticed was dull orange and a silver tone. It was a solid object. The edges were round, I count the width was shaped circular, compared with the surrounding stars, it was bigger and quite brighter."

The rest of the form contains standard UFO reporting form fields such as:
- Sky conditions
- Weather conditions
- Moon and star visibility
- Lighting conditions
- Request for detailed description of the phenomenon

The document appears to be page 3 of some number of pages, as indicated at the bottom right of the page.

Only thing not covered was the perimeter of the small coloul flashes of light which were visible sometimes directly surrounded by the object. They were cross shaped and plastel very fast, only 1 flash to a cross, no far as I could tell. No sound but to move. But very unusual.

Card 117

Saturday nite
May 24, 1969

Dear Sirs:

My name is [redacted] I am 16 years old and live in Nelsonville, Ohio. I just recently had quite an unexplained experience happen to me as I was on my way home from South Carolina.

I was traveling by thumbing rides, and on Wednesday night, May 14th, my last ride of that evening was very mountainous near Pipesville, Kentucky. This was not the exact location, but it was the only town 7 any size close. Wednesday night I slept in the car which had brought me here, planning to leave early in the morning. The car was parked between two mountains, which was a valley with a couple of crude pickups. I was totally unable to sleep, so I was starting up at the beautiful, clear

spy. At approximately 4:00 a.m.
which was Thursday morning, I
was puzzled by a particularly
larger and outstanding glowing
object which stood out very
clearly from everything else.
After initial observation and
concentration on this strange
sight, I came to these conclusions
concerning the size and behavior
of this object: It has approximately
5 times as large as any of
the stars directly surrounding
it. The object's color changed
and swirled between a dull
orange and a grayish-silver,
mostly staying the orangish
color. Unquestionably this object
would change positions by
moving in spurts, either up
and down or sometimes from
side to side. The night was
quite, yet this object made no
sound. It was beautifully glided
silently up and down, and from

side to side. But what I saw
next around this object was
truly very strange. This sight
which I saw was, and is
very hard to explain. The best
possible way to describe it
is to say that all at once, tiny,
mass-shaped, multi-colored
lights began flashing, beautifully
tightly around the not
stationary object. They only, each
lasted fractions of seconds, but
they showed up very clear
against the black sky. These
specks of colored light lasted a
few minutes, then as suddenly
as they began, they ceased.
I continued to watch this
bizarre object for a few
more minutes, then it diminished
completely from my sight. I
approximate the total time
of time by me as around
45 minutes. Being a sparsely
populated area, and the time

of the sighting being at a
being sally morning how
I was unable to find or see
anyone near who saw the
object as I did.

Summing up, I would like
to say that this occurrence was
the most unexplainable, thought
provoking incident I have
ever witnessed personally. Being
the only one who bagged and
this is the first time still it
happened, so has really tried
to convey what I saw, although
you as did see it, how can
you or I describe something so
very strange? But if you are
interested more, please contact
me, and I will gladly do
anything to help myself find
out exactly what it was. What
I would really like to do is go
back to the sighting area, and
with others maybe I did.
I know probably you receive

Here is the text from the document:

many letters from people who
have been something indeed, and
others that are found out later
to be just make up or the
persons were mistakes by a
conventional object, which
under certain circumstances
misled them to jumping to
wild conclusions. But, I
suggest your main headache is
deciding between the real and
unreal. But whatever you do
with this, please at least consider
that I was patient enough
to try to explain what the
UFO actually was.
If possible, I would like
to know what you have to
say about my sighting.
