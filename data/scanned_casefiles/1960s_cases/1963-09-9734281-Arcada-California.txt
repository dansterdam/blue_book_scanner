The document appears to be an official Air Force document with "PRIORITY" marked at the top, and seems to be related to a UFO report given the filename context and handwritten "UFO" notation.

Some text in the main body of the document is partially illegible, but I can make out fragments such as:

"...FLYING SAUCER HEADED OVER NEAR CALIF. CALL..."
"...OBJECT APPEARED IN FRONT OF AIR..."
"...OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT TIME OF STRAIT BEARING..."

The rest of the text in the main body is too blurry or cut off to confidently transcribe without potentially introducing errors.

Dear Captain:

Thank you for your letter of October 7 regarding UFO information about the weather siting of the 21st of September. I am sorry that this reply has been delayed this long.

I do not have any information concerning this siting, but I am referring you to Mr. Phil Ewing of the Head Building, Eugene, Oregon. Mr. Ewing acts as a coordinator for the collection of such information for the American Meteor Society, and I am quite sure that he will be able to help you. You can contact Mr. Ewing in a very helpful, persistent individual in this respect, and I have a great deal of faith in his ability.

I am sending directly to Mr. Ewing a copy of your letter to me, and I rather suggest that you will hear from him in a short time.

If I can be of any further service to you, please let me hear from you.

Sincerely yours,
S. G. Ebbighausen
Professor of Physics

Captain Hector Quintanilla, Jr.,
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Captain Quintanilla:

Dr. E.G. Abblghausen of the University of Oregon has forwarded to me your letter relative to the fireball sighted in southern Oregon and Northern California on September 21.

So far as I am able to ascertain, the object was not sighted in the Pacific Northwest. I saw no mention in area newspapers, or on radio news.

Dr. Abblghausen reports that he also is without information.

Kindest regards,
Phil F. Brogan
Northwest Director,
American Meteor Society.
