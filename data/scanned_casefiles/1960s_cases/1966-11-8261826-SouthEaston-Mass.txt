Dear Sirs:

Although I am only 13, I'm very interested in the investigation of U.F.O.'s. I know I should have an open mind in the matter but I'm very much convinced that U.F.O.'s(from outer space) exist. I have done much research in the matter and am writing to different sources of information on this matter. The reason for believing in these U.F.O.'s is because I've seen 3(with very other reliable people)

I called the Air Force(Otis Air Force Base)and talked to Commander Bachelor and told them about it. Here is the description of them:

NOV 1. THE SEEN:7:15;small white light turning into
1966    a larger red light and moved upward across the
         sky, in no course at all. Disappeared. Made no
         sound. About 2 or 3 times larger than a star.

NOV    2.THE SEEN:7:15-7:30;All colors; moved very
1966    slowly; Little larger than a star; Made no sound.

DEC    3. White light; moved very fast; Size of star; no
1966    sound.

I read the article you wrote in the Science Digest December 1966 issue and I'd like to say that I was nervous, but happy when I saw the object. I did not panic.

This matter on U.F.O.'s is very important to me. I am being called crazy, etc. because I feel so strongly in them, but somehow we will find a conclusive proof on these objects.

I would appreciate it very much if you could send me some information on the subject of U.F.O.'s. My address is below. Please send as quickly as possible. THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME.

Yours very truly,
[Signature redacted]
Massachusetts
