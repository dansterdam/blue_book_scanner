I was walking south on Conger to where on the corner of Stephen St. A bright light caught my left eye and I turned around and saw this object. It moved very fast at first but then it slowed down when it was almost overhead. The light disappeared. A rather noisy propeller-driven plane came into earshot. I did not observe this craft but the sound lasted for almost 20 secs. After the plane left the object reappeared much smaller and higher it was gone in a few secs.
