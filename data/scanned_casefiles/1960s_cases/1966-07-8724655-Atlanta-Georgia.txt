The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report of unidentified flying objects observed from July 23 to 27, 1966. The report provides details such as the description of the objects, their color, size, and shape, as well as the observations made by the witnesses. The text of the report is as follows:

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
JULY 23 - 27, 1966

A. Description of Objects:
1. Shapes: According to witnesses, the shape appears to be oval on a vertical axis; however, some witnesses have the impression that it was spherical.
2. Size: There is general agreement that the size was somewhat smaller than that of a pea. In some cases slightly smaller, in other cases slightly larger.
3. Color: No established color is known since it appears that the objects were light with a reddish cast and then white. The color is most frequently described as a rhythmic change. 
4. Number: The number of objects viewed is unknown since when first noted there were only two which attracted attention. After this occurred, more attention was paid to the objects, and an increasing number were noted so that by the night of July 27, 1966, morning of the 28th, may have amounted to as many as 15.
5. Formation: There was no particular formation detectable. It was noted that some of the objects would remain stationary for quite some time and then leave in a rapid direction change. On the other hand, some appeared to be for a purpose stated as one object remained in the same position for two hours and then departed in a horizontal direction at an extremely high rate of speed disappearing over the horizon. 
6. Features or details: Two witnesses, both FAA employees, testified that at least some of the objects appeared to be cylindrical in shape, although possibly flat. The object lowered was slightly larger in apparent size than the others. 
7. Tail, trail, or exhaust including size compared to objects: There was no tail, trail, or exhaust including size compared to objects. There was no apparent trail connecting the objects which appeared to hover.
8. Sound: No sound was heard by any observers or witnesses.
9. Unusual features: The most unusual feature of the objects was their ability to move off at rapid speed. The lighting features are themselves unusual in that some appeared to change in a gradual subtle manner while others had more abrupt changes. Some of these changes were very rhythmic while others were quite uneven and unpredictable. Another unusual feature appeared to be from observation alone without any physical aspects to the objects.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Witnesses the fact that in some cases the objects reversed course without any apparent turn around motion. It generated one of the objects through binoculars and noting a very erratic motion from side to side, back and forth, attributed it to my inability to hold the binoculars steady. However, I noticed that on those occasions when I observed the objects through binoculars, they were not moving in the erratic fashion that the object was. This fact has been supported by both Air Force witnesses and civilians with free lance photographers that it could not be the same objects.

Description of objects: Due to the many objects observed and the many courses taken, it was often difficult to follow each object. In general, the courses were courses not followed by the stars. This was particularly noted in order to distinguish the objects from stars.

1. What called attention of observer: On the first night, July 25, 1966, the object attention was called by the exceptionally brilliant white light, apparentl slightly to the west of Fulton County Airport.

2. Analysis of first sighting: The first observer, Mr. --------------, stated that the angle above the horizon was about 30 degrees, while most of the other witnesses put it more on the order of 70 degrees. This difference in the observation point on the first night, due to the large number of people observing this phenomenin, can be explained in that each person saw a different portion of the same object from their individual viewpoint.   

3. Angle, elevation and azimuth as disappeared: In all but a very few cases, the 55-60 degree angle disappeared. In some cases, they disappeared over the horizon in various directions. Two of these are reported to have dipped below the horizon on the north horizon.

4. Flight path and maneuvers: For the most part the objects appeared to remain very steady in position or at least make gentle movements. Unless they chose to leave the area, in which case they generally left rather rapidly. No particular maneuvers, as such, could be determined.

5. How did object disappear (direction): As previously stated, most disappeared by simply fading away until they became no longer visible. There were a few cases where they appeared to go straight up and disappear.

6. How long visible: In general, on all three nights the objects were visible by RADAR for long periods of time, though they may have been actually visible longer, but personnel are not available to determine any appreciable time of observing the phenomenon.

K. My title is Chief of the Flight Service Station at Fulton County Airport, Atlanta, Georgia. I have spent the entire night in preparing this report, including firewatching operations. The information contained herein is the result of my close observation as described. There are no lance photographs, nor do I feel at this point that I have enough information to offer much assistance to the investigation of the observed incident. I have said to myself several times during the investigation that some of the lighting effects may have been caused by the dense atmosphere prevailing at the time. It further occurs to me that the objects, which have excited so much interest, may have been normal military aircraft which were operating under special conditions. On the surface it would seem that some unusual activity was in progress and that the objects were capable of speeds beyond those commonly known to us modern aircraft. They started to illuminate a brilliant violet-red light, then suddenly move off at a very rapid rate. I got one glimpse of the objects through my binoculars on an automobile top, and then suddenly move off at a very rapid rate. I do not feel that I can do anymore reporting than that at this time.

L. Evidence of physical existence, such as Photographs, etc.: One of the employees of the lance photographers, which was quite elaborately equipped with telephoto lens and especially high speed camera equipment. I very hopeful that he has some of these become available to me. I will submit them forthwith, with any other evidence we may obtain in the meantime.

On July 25, 1966 at 0840 GMT, the observer stepped out of the door to make a routine weather observation and promptly noticed two exceptionally bright lights toward the west moving in an erratic direction. The lights were approximately 30 degrees from the horizon and 20 degrees apart. The lights were observed for about 5 minutes. The observer's attention was attracted to the lights by their extreme brightness. The observation ceased due to the press of other duties. It was particularly noted that the lights were bright white and appeared stationary at first. No sound was heard. No change in color was noted at this time.

At 0925 GMT, the observer went out to observe a cloud bank moving in from the Northeast. At this time, it was noted that a bright light was located Northeast, estimated to bear 70 degrees true from the observation point at the FAA Building and estimated to be about 20 degrees above the horizon. This light was observed through 7x50 binoculars, manufactured by Swift, and appeared about the size of a star. The old Edgefield telescope was focused on the object and it appeared somewhat vertically oval in shape including the previously trailing object. The object was a dazzling white color and could possibly have been as large as an automobile. It was definitely longer than it was wide. The object appeared to have been stationary and exhibited no motion. This object was not observed previously and no positive correlation could possibly be made between the two objects. It is advised that further sound recordings be made of such bright light moving near that location with no sound emanating therefrom.

On July 26, 1966 at 0345 GMT another object was sighted bearing about 90 degrees from the Flight Service Station and about 30 degrees above the horizon which moved toward the North and then veered somewhat vertically oval in shape including the previously trailing object that was no longer visible. This second object was observed through 7x50 binoculars and appeared about the size of a star. A simultaneous visual/binocular observation of a very eerie nature was visible through the binoculars, while a known star was gradually obscured.

At 0755 GMT the object had become apparently stationary and some believed it to be a star; however, while looking through binoculars I saw a section of the object changing colors from red to green to white with the remainder of the object remaining a brilliant white. In accordance with the criteria, the object appeared to be about the size of a pea.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present, only text describing a UFO sighting.

The text output is as follows:

At 0823 GMT I noted another object high to the West and moving. It moved North-ward, and I could see it through my binoculars the same changing colored lights that characterized the first object. At 0914 GMT I was convinced that it was the same object I had seen earlier. This information was reported to the Officer of the Day at Dobbins Air Force Base.

At 0905 GMT I obtained a definite clinometer reading which was 30 degrees above the horizon. This was moving object located approximately 70 degrees East of North.

At 0930 GMT broken clouds blocked further view of the unidentified flying objects.

On July 27, 1966 at 0540 GMT I observed through binoculars a semi-stationary light in the sky. It appeared to be pulsating, and was giving off red, white and blue colors. The light appeared to be a bright blue glow and was noted on surrounding stars. At 0630 GMT I saw a bright light give off a flash of red and green. It appeared to be a large, semi-circular shaped object and emanated this blue slow glow noticed on surrounding stars.

At 0835 GMT I saw a large bright light on the horizon to the East. It appeared to be rising slowly. At 0905 GMT the above bright light, regarded by some as the moon, was measured and found to be 15 degrees above the horizon. At 1026 GMT this same light measured 20 degrees above the horizon. At 1045 GMT this light had dimmed but flashed a brilliant blue-green color and then faded. The colors appeared to be changing rapidly; in each instance, the colors appeared to be changing rapidly.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

On July 25, 1966 at 0842 GMT I observed two objects close together and very bright, about 70 degrees above the horizon, bearing about 230 degrees from the my position. They appeared to become stationary. The one on the right moved toward a Northeasterly direction and increased in size, but the shape was not determinable at this point.

The size was considered to be about the size of a dime, considering usual stars to be about the size of a head of a pin. 

The color appeared to be whitish orange when together. Did not notice color changes until it reached a point about 20 degrees above the horizon, and at this point it appeared to become a reddish shade. Changes in color and also at this point it appeared to be larger.

There was no sound heard from the object. The object appeared to have disappeared behind a building.

The objects were in view for approximately one hour and twenty minutes. My observations were from the sound and observed with the unaided eye with occasional use of 7x35 binoculars.

I am specifically positive it was not a conventional aircraft within my present knowledge of aircraft operations.

Color changes were probably caused and not believed caused by atmospheric conditions.

On July 26, 1966 at 0738 GMT observed UFO approximately East of Station moving to North and Easterly and a shape similar to what was observed the night before, located about 20 degrees above horizon.

At 0832 GMT observed motion of UFO between two stars that were not moving. UFO moving Northward, did not note change of color.

On July 27, 1956 at 0340 GMT I observed, through binoculars, what appeared to be the same object seen about the same position on the previous night. Object was changing color which did not conform with adjacent stars. At about 0350 GM I lost sight of the object. This was regarded as being a satellite by approximately 12 to 15 people present at this time. First object remained visible until sunrise.

On July 25, 1966 at about 0845 GMT I was told of what was thought to be two satellites overhead. I went out for a moment and noticed them moving in opposite directions.

On July 26, 1966 at approximately 0730 GMT my attention was called to a bright light stationary in the northwest. It then appeared to be changing from red to green to white, occasionally white. No sound was heard.

On July 27, 1966 at about 0630 GMT my attention was called to what appeared to be a satellite moving overhead toward the Northeast at a rapid rate. Finally disappearing beyond the horizon.

On July 25, 1966 at approximately 0840 GMT I observed two bright lights traveling slowly over Atlanta, Georgia, south toward the horizon. These were observed with the unaided eye. No sound was heard. This gave impression of being silently high. Observed for about two or three minutes.

At about 0925 GMT I viewed a bright light to Northeast at about 30 degrees above horizon with distinctly changing colors of red, green and white. With the unaided eye this seemed larger than a star and seemed to disappear distinctly faster than a star and the colors were distinctly rotating. It appeared to be stationary.

On July 26, 1966 at 0745 GMT I viewed the object at about the same position as previous observation. Through binoculars it was noted to have an alternating red, green and white lights with the hanging part reflecting these colors. Green seemed to be the predominant color.

On July 27, 1966 at a time unknown I noted the presence of the object East-Northeast with the only difference being that it appeared smaller. During this observation it was moving from about 30 degrees to about 80 degrees above the horizon, and toward the East.

On July 25, 1966 at approximately 0840 GMT I noticed two extremely bright objects approximately 5-7 degrees overhead. The one on the right proceeded a little higher than the one on the left. They appeared to speed in a Southerly direction. The color was a bright white. No sound was heard.

On July 26, 1966 at about 0735 GMT I was called out to note an object that had characteristics that led blinking upon it indicating a pulsing or flashing type light with a steady glow. It remained stationary during my observation which was based on the criteria. It remained stationary during my observation which was of a relatively short duration.

On July 27, 1966 I have nothing to contribute that has not already been stated by others.

The image appears to contain a photograph depicting an unidentified flying object (UFO) or other aerial phenomenon. The text describes observations made by an "Electronics Maintenance Technician" of multiple objects moving at a high rate of speed on two separate occasions in July 1966. The objects were observed through binoculars and were not identified as aircraft within the observer's conception. The text also mentions that on a later date, a larger group of the same objects was observed.

OCR Text Output:
On July 25, 1966 at approximately 0845 GMT I, with others, observed two very bright lights skyward flight. They appeared to be stationary, then one left in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed. The other proceeded in a northerly direction at a slower speed.
At approximately 0922 GMT an object appeared in the northeast approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. It was observed for some time and was believed to be a single object having various colored reflections which varied considerably at times.
On July 26, 1966 at approximately 0825 GMT while looking one unidentified flying object through binoculars, it appeared to separate itself and an object appeared too large to be a bird or aircraft. I noted no sound from any of these objects.
These objects were not aircraft within my conception of presently operating aircraft.
On July 27, 1966 some of the same objects appeared but quite a large group of 7, 8, and 10 and some middle personnel were observing. We avoided interfering.

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
Memorandum
SUBJECT: REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT(S)

FROM: Editor-Writer, 80-3A
TO : Public Affairs Officer, 80-3

Mr. related the following is "gist" of highlights taken by me in shorthand for his report on unidentified flying objects sighted in the Atlanta, Georgia area on the above address, which also relates to other reports of Unidentified Flying Objects sighted in the same area during that time period.

Mr. Related, in part, that on Sunday evening, at approximately 9:30 PM EST, July 24, 1966, my neighbors old-enough to drive were playing outside with two of his playmates, a 13-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy. When suddenly, the three children started complaining of bright lights in front of them that were hurting their eyes. The lights seemed to be oscillating or flickering. The children came screaming in, badly frightened, with their eyes badly inflamed, about it running from the porch. The object, which was about three feet off the ground, then "objected" - took off, straight up, like a bolt of lightning," and disappeared. They said "it looked like a ball of lightning," and disappeared. They said the object was accompanied by two blinking bright lights."

Mr. then related that he had been prone to discount their descriptions as exaggerated by the effects of the lights on their eyes. However, he reported that the children's eyes were still badly inflamed the following day. He is satisfied that his children gave factual descriptions of what they saw and that he could relay the information to us. It is reported that the children "yelled that the object was just above their eye-level."

The following are in answer to specific questions that you then asked Mr.
Q. What was the exact time of the incident, again?
A. Approximately 9:30 PM EST, Sunday, July 24, 1966.
Q. How close did the object come to the children?
A. The children state 6 yards and 10 yards and 12 yards away. The object, according to them, was just above their eye-level.
Q. How large did the object appear to them?
A. About three feet off the ground.
Q. Did the object make any sound?
A. None. They were just badly frightened and complained about their eyes.
Q. How bright were the lights?
A. Very bright lights, side by side. The "black canopy" appeared to be holding up the lights.
Q. Speed of the object, again?
A. From the children's description, an almost instantaneous "shooting up" - straight up.
Mr. was also referred to the appropriate DeSAPM staff office and requested to refer this info to them.
