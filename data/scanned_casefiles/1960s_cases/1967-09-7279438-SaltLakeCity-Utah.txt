Dear [redacted],

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). 

While detailed analyses, angular velocities, or weather information may be available to a scientific investigator, we are unable to provide a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a typed letter describing an unidentified flying object sighting.

The text in the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:

Below we have given a complete report on the unidentified flying object that we sighted last night:

On Saturday night, September 23, 1967, shortly before 9:00 P.M., we were riding out Route 35, south along South Cottonwood Drive. About five to seven miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah, we spotted an object some four to five miles away, and was roughly three times as bright as the most brilliant star. As the object approached, it was as bright as a headlight bulb. They say from the brilliant white light, there were no other lights visible. It moved slowly, it would stop, it was silent. We decided to stop our car. When we got out, it seemed to wobble after a while. It crossed in front of our view, and it did not disappear. We could see it moving extremely low, hovering over some lights which seemed to wobble also. The object was in sight from four to seven minutes.

We do not want any publicity whatsoever, and for all we care, you can throw this letter away once it is explained. Most of the people (including my family, G.H.) that we know are skeptical and they might never let us live it down if they find out we have reported it.

Sincerely,

Mail to:
Salt Lake City

TDPT (UPO) 2. Col Quintanilla/70915/ms/29 Apr 63
UFO Observation, September 25, 1967
Salt Lake City, Utah 84103

1. Reference your unidentified observation of September 25, 1967. Because of the date and the difficulty in sighting and the lapse of time since then, we feel that it is now too late to make a complete investigation into your report.

2. The description you provided is similar to others we have received of aircraft with their landing lights on. Since aircraft flights records for September 25, 1967 have been destroyed, it is impossible to determine if there were any aircraft in the area at the time your object was seen but not known, if the wind is blowing aircraft can often be seen but not heard, at the time and location from the observatory.

3. We thank you for completing our form, and your report will be filed with others of that time period. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation. In the event you should ever observe another unidentified flying object, please report it to the nearest Air Force base for a far better position.

A VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
