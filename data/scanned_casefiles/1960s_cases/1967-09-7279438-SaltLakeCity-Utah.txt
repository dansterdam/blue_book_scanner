Reference your recent unidentified flying object sighting which you reported to the Air Force. The information which we have received is not sufficient for a scientific investigation. Request you complete the attached AF Form 117 and return it in the self-addressed envelope. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch

Dear Sir:

Below we have given a complete report on the unidentified flying object that we sighted last night.

On Monday night, September 25, 1967, shortly before 9:00 P.M., we were riding our bikes along Foothill Boulevard, near 15th South, when we spotted an unusually bright object in the western sky. It was, at our guess, three or four miles away, and was roughly three times as bright as the most brilliant star. At first, we thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but, aside from the brilliant white light, there were no other lights visible. It moved oddly. It would slow down, then suddenly speed up. At times it appeared to wobble. After a while, a tree blocked it from view, and it did not reappear. We could see nothing except this white light, which was about the size of a dime at arm's length. We heard no sound and the object did not change color. We had this object in sight from four to seven minutes.

We do not want any publicity whatever, and for all we care, you can throw this letter away once it is explained. Most of the people, (including my family, G.N.) that we know are skeptics and they might never let us hear the end of it if they find out we have reported it.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

UFO Observation, September 25, 1967

Salt Lake City, Utah 84108

1. Reference your unidentified observation of September 25, 1967. Because of the error that was initially made in processing your sighting and the lapse of time since then, we feel that it is now too late to make a complete investigation into your report.

2. The description you provided is similar to others we have received of aircraft with their landing lights on. Since aircraft flight records for September have long since been destroyed, it is too late to positively determine if there were any aircraft in the area at the time. Aircraft can often be seen but not heard, if the wind is blowing away from the observer.

3. We thank you for completing our form, and your report will be filed with others of that time period. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. In the event you should ever observe another unidentified flying object, please report it to the nearest Air Force base for they are in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.
