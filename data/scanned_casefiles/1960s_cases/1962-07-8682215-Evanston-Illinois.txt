Three school newspaper boys, Mark Channing of Dalysmpic Street, Invarc ar gill N.Z. reported seeing 6 objects like polished silver discs about 75 feet in diameter, at an altitude of about 7,000 feet on 7 July 1962. Page 2 of the APRO Bulletin for May 1962. The boys reported the objects moving at a high rate of speed, moving northward across the sky, then suddenly accelerating and disappearing in less than 3 minutes and appeared to be moving at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
They estimated the objects to be moving at a speed of over 700 mph. The objects were observed for a total of 3 minutes and no sound was heard.

"Mystery Satellite" Sighted At
Hong Kong, 9 July 1962. Local resident R. L. Hobson reported that he had
seen an unusual object in the sky which appeared as a bright white light, twice in two hours on the
evening of 9 July. The "Russian and American satellites" take,
according to Hobson, about 15 minutes to cross the sky. Russian and American
satellites take roughly 20 plus minutes
for transit.

NEW ZEALAND: The Otago Daily Times carried the following account on 7-12-62: "A many colored ball of light which flashed over the city in and around 7:55 to 8:00 pm was the subject of a studio discussion in "New World" on the evening of 11-7-62. This report was made in a newspaper article written by a local resident who saw the object clearly. This object was described as it traversed in a southeastern direction in the sky and was still visible for a few minutes.

The image appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a report of a UFO sighting by Boy Scouts and their staff members at Camp Lakota in Illinois on July 12, 1962.

The text in the document states that the first object sighted was "like a clear disc with a pointed top". The next two objects were smaller and appeared to come from the larger one. The sightings were reported to Professor Hynek, and the object was described as a jet when first seen, but it proved to be too "popular" in appearance.

The text also mentions that the first (cigar-shaped) object changed directions and began to drop over the landscape, and the second object also vanished from sight.

As an OCR system, the text output from the document is as follows:

BOY SCOUTS REPORT SIGHTINGS OTHERS SEE UFO's

An object which changed direction faster than would be possible with a regular aircraft, was sighted by four boy scouts and three staff members of Camp Lakota in Illinois on 12 July 1962. 

IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HYNEK, PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AT DEFIANCE COLLEGE, the J. C. Holley family of Defiance gave this description:

The first object sighted was like a clear disc with a pointed top. The next two objects were smaller and appeared to come from the larger one.

The names of the scouts who sighted the object at 8:30 p.m. on the 12th were: Eric Nelson, Robert Anderson, Ronnie Bowman and LeRoy Hodsap. They were walking along the Four-Leaf Clover road when they saw the objects.

The sightings were reported to Professor Hynek, and the following is additional information:

When first seen, the object was a jet, when at about 30 degrees elevation, but it proved to be too "popular" in appearance. It started to move at a slight angle down and to their left and grew in size, very quickly to "disappearing" proportions. Short bright flashes of light appeared and the object stayed stationary while the first object remained in motion. 

The first object suddenly "dived" from slightly below the second object as if it possibly dropped from the higher object. The third object left a bright, clear contrail which hung in the air like a jet trail. It then disappeared behind a cloud and never reappeared.

Shortly thereafter, the first (cigar-shaped) object changed directions and began to drop over the landscape, and the second object also vanished from sight.

under and 5 penumbra. The former has the shape of a cone it opens to a point at about the attance of the earth from the moon. At the phase of new moon it is always in the same direction from earth as the sun, but generally the shadow both in umbra and penumbra, passes either north or south of our planet and there is no total solar eclipse. However, sometimes the tip of the shadow does reach the earth. Then it causes a band, perhaps a hundred miles wide and several thousand miles long. where the total eclipse is visible. Around it is a much larger region, where the penumbra touches earth, in which people can see a partial eclipse of the sun, the upper parts of the inner shadow is painted toward the earth, but does not reach it, to other parts of the earth see only a crescent or partial eclipse.
And even though the moon may come in front of the sun, that does not completely cover up the surface, a thin ring of the sun's surface remains visible around the lunar disc. The Latin for this is "annulus", an annular eclipse.
On July 31, the path of the annular eclipse starts on the sun in dating in the interior of Brazil and the Guianas, the Atlantic Ocean, and Central Africa, rolling in fast off West Africa, and ending in the South Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of South America. Florida (where the sun will be only slightly obscured), the Atlantic Ocean, Sicily, part of Arabia, and the western Indian Ocean.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be an article from the Science News Letter titled "Three Planets Now on View" discussing the visibility of Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn in the evening sky in July 1962.

The text of the article is as follows:

THREE PLANETS NOW ON VIEW

Three planets, Venus in the west, Jupiter in the east and Saturn higher and farther to the south will appear in the July evening sky, James Stokley reports.

"It's a favorable year for planet-watching," he says, "when the planets are on view in the early evening. On July 31, when there is a 'penumbral' eclipse of the moon, the planets will still be in view."

Venus, the brightest of the trio, is now low in the west after sunset. It remains visible for about two hours after the sun goes down.

The planet Mercury is farthest west of the horizon for a few mornings around the middle of the month and two hours after sunrise it can be seen low in the east.

The brightest of the trio is Venus, which remains visible low in the west for about two hours after sunset. It reaches is greatest brilliance in this part of its orbit, and then begins to sink lower as it approaches its inferior conjunction with the sun. This is when Venus passes between the earth and the sun, and appears to descend below the western horizon. Jupiter, a little higher in the sky, will remain visible for a shorter time after sunset. Like Venus, it too appears to get lower in the sky as the month progresses. Saturn is still higher in the sky, in the constellation Sagittarius, and remains visible until near midnight.

Antares Appears in South

As for the stars, which always remain in place, unlike the planets which are constantly changing their positions, the brightest in the southern sky is Antares, a red star in the group called Scorpius, the Scorpion. This red color is characteristic of it. Here is a rather faint constellation—Libra, the Scales, to the right of Scorpius.

Higher in the eastern sky-nearly overhead-is Vega, in the constellation Lyra. This bright star is one of the summer's most famous constellations, along with the Southern Cross, which are shown on the map of the northern sky. Look for them, to the left of Deneb and Altair, the eagle-and much higher in the sky.

Look to the northwest to see the familiar group of the Great Bear, Ursa Major, which includes the stars that make up the Big Dipper.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for June 23, 1962

FIELDS
NUTRITION
Location of Milk Taste 
in Store Changes
- THE TASTE of milk bought in grocery
stores can depend on where the carton is
placed. David Lindsay, food scientist at
the University of California Food Sciences
Inst tute, says three factors:
Light. - Changes in taste are more
obvious the closer the milk carton is kept
to the glass door of the refrigerator. The
light streaming through the glass "can
change the taste of milk even in protected
cartons," especially in summer. Milk near
the back of the case, sheltered from light,
will sometimes taste better.
Temperature. - Milk at the front of the
case, next to the door, may be several 
degrees warmer than milk at the back,
close to the lamp, and sometimes does not
develop as well.
Air movement. - A flow of cold air
can make some cartons taste worse than
others, says Walter Dunkley at the Food
Institute of the University of California. 
The milkfat globules are hard to pin down,
he says, and the flavor changes with other
factors. "Matters of flavor of milk, the cow's
diet and many other factors."
Walter Dunkley says the flavor changes
introduced by these variations in storage
conditions  often enough to create an occa-
sional milk-quality  problem.
Such problems are introduced by fluores-
cent lamps similar to those caused by
sunlight, when the light bleaches the car-
otenoid pigments in the milk fat. In sum-
mer, when milk consumption is highest and
fluorescent light exposure to the greatest,
the deterioration can be most severe.
H. R. Franklin and R. M. Pangborn, also
at the Food Institute of the University of
California, have done taste-test studies
with Mr. Dunkley in the milk-flavor studies.

SOCIOLOGY
Hey, Calif., Great Lakes 
Rival E. Coast in 1980

* THIS WEEK'S 50 urban areas will
challenge the Atlantic Seaboard region in
population gains 20 years from now
Some key new population figures are:
Green Bay, Wis. to Rochester, N. Y. with
an estimated 70,000 persons in 1960.
Other leaders: Pittsburgh will overtake
Washington, D.C.; Milwaukee will surpass
St. Petersburg, with 10,000,000 and
from the Mexican border to San Francisco. 
This urbanized corridor already accounts
for size of the East Coast strip.
The "island seacoast" is sometimes called 
the "sprawl along the seacoast" reaching from 
Portland, Me., to  Washington, D.C. This 
area now contains 20 percent of the 
nation's total population, but will have
only 16 percent by 1980 - new growth in 
Great Lake states and West will make this 
region less dominant.

AUTOMATION
Russia Hopes to Surpass 
U.S. via Automation
* THE SOVIET UNION'S main hope of
surpassing (U.S. industrial production lies
in the development of "automatic con
trol," a professor at Princeton University
told the annual meeting of the American 
Philosophical Society.
The USSR has made "very rapid strides"
in this most advanced type of automation
technology, with machinery which can "take
over" a greater part of industrial operations.
The Soviets believe this system is essential 
for further industrial growth and overtaking
U.S. production, Francis G. Gibson, a former
engineer who visited the Soviet's major auto-
mation research centers, said.
But the Russian's are necessarily putting more 
emphasis on it.

ASTRONOMY
Test Seen for Einstein's 
Theory of Gravity Waves

* A CHANCE TO TEST the part of
Einstein's theory of general relativity that
predicts the existence of gravitational waves
is afforded by the discovery of a star pair 
600 miles from the sun's system.
The object is known as Hercules X-1. Its
behavior is calculated to give evidence of the
known period of orbital motion—only 81
minutes—are required for one resolution 
around its center of orbit. The one star, 
while dead, the other is not observable.
The stars are believed to be rotating 
around a common center so fast—1,500,000 
miles an hour—that the motion is indicated 
to be producing gravitational waves. Their 
faint and astronomers have not been able 
to determine whether the object is a double 
star or a different kind of binary system.
Dr. Robert P. Kraft, of Lick Observatory, 
College of the Pacific, and Dr. John Craford,
at Pasadena, Calif., physics Division, report
these, California Institute of Technology,
findings in Nature, published in the April 21
issue of that journal.
