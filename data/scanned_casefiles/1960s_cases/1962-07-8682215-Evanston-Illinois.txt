Antarctica Sightings
Corroborated

Thirteen-year-old newspaper boy, Mark Charlesworth of Dalrymple Street, Invacarill, N.Z., reported seeing a cluster of three lights at 7:05 p.m. on 7 July 1962 (See APRO Bulletin for May 1963, Page 8 and correct sighting date to 7 July instead of 8 as stated). The boy reported that he and a friend were standing outside on a street when the object traveled up toward east to west at a fast pace, being in sight not more than 3 minutes and appeared to be losing altitude as it traveled eastward. Mark said the object appeared to be three points of light while his friend described it as a cluster. He said the center light was brighter than the others.

A local schoolteacher was located and interviewed about the sighting. He stated seeing a similar object at 5:25 p.m. on the same evening. The object's movements and description were similar to the boys' account. The observer did not believe he was seeing a mirage or other natural phenomenon.

This case brought his information to light.

"Mystery Satellite" Sighted

Hong Kong, 9 July 1962. Local resident R. I. Hobson reported that he had seen an object which gave off a bright white light, twice in two hours on the evening of 8 July. The "Bangkok World" from which this information is taken, reported that Hobson said the object traveled from south to north over the colony and took about 15 minutes to cross the sky. (Russian and American satellites take roughly 20 plus minutes for transit.)

NEW ZEALAND: The Otago Daily Times carried the following account on 7-12-62. "A many colored ball of light, which flashed over Dunedin and appeared to hover over the sea to the South. This happened on 7-11-62 at 11:10 P.M. The usual Pip-ball conclusion was made by an astronomer, Dr. B. Sessink, describing it as a 'ball preceded by a tail, ball proceeded by a tail'. Mr. A. Clark, was in his car near St. Clair. The sand was lit up by a strange glow and a strange object dimmed to a pale blue at regular intervals and was still there after a few minutes."

Boy Scouts Report Sightings
—Others See UFO's

An object which changed direction faster than would be possible with a regular aircraft was sighted by four boy scouts and three staff members of Camp Lakota in Illinois on 12 July 1962.

In a letter addressed to Professor Charles Maney, Physics Professor at Defiance College, the J. C. Holley family of Defiance gave this description:

The first object sighted was like a cigar with a pointed tail. The next object was shaped the same, but were smaller and appeared to come from the larger one.

The names of the scouts who sighted the object at 8:30 p.m. on the 12th were Charles Nelson, Robert Anderson, Ronnie Bowman and LeRoy Hodapp. They were walking along the Power Dam road when they saw the objects.

The sightings were reported to Professor Maney, and the following is additional detail: The boys first thought the object was a jet, when first seen at about 30 degrees elevation, but it proved to be too "globular" in appearance. It started to move at a slight angle down and to their left and grew in size from a dot to "sugar-shaped." Shortly a very bright speck appeared to the right of the object and stayed stationary while the first object remained in motion. A third object suddenly "fired" from slightly below the second object as if it possibly dropped from object number two. The third object left a bright, clear contrail which hung in the air like a jet trail. It then disappeared behind or into a cloud and never reappeared.

Shortly thereafter, the first (cigar-shaped) object changed directions and began to drop over the horizon, and the second object also vanished from sight.

u.ula and a semi-lira. The former has the shape of a cone; it tapers to a point at about the distance of the earth from the moon. At the phase of new moon, it is always in the same direction from earth as the sun, but generally the shadow, both umbra and penumbra, passes either north or south of our planet and there is no eclipse.

Not even when the point of the conical umbra is aimed directly toward the earth, there may not be a total solar eclipse. However, sometimes the tip of the shadow does not quite reach the earth. For example, a hundred miles wide and several thousand miles long, where the total eclipse is visible. Around it is a much larger region, where the penumbra touches earth, in which people can see a partial eclipse of the sun.

But at other times—such as July 31—the tip of the inner shadow is pointed toward the earth but does not reach us. In other words, the moon is far enough away that its apparent disc is smaller than the sun's. And even though the moon may come in front of the sun, that body is not completely hidden. A ring of the solar surface remains visible around the lunar disc. The Latin for ring is "annulus," so this is called an annular (not annual) eclipse.

On July 31, the path of the annular eclipse starts as the sun is rising in the interior of Venezuela. It passes eastward, over Brazil and the Guianas, the Atlantic Ocean and Central Africa, ending just east of Madagascar at sunset. A larger area will experience a partial eclipse. This includes northern South America, Florida (where the sun will rise eclipsed), the Atlantic Ocean, all of Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, Spain, Sicily, part of Arabia, and the western Indian Ocean.

ASTRONOMY                                SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR June 23, 1962

Three Planets Now on View
and Saturn higher and farther to the south will appear in
the July evening sky, James Stokley reports.

► FOLLOWING the early part of 1962, 
when no planets were on view in the eve-
ning sky, we now have three that are easily 
visible. These are shown in the accom-
panying maps, which give the appearance 
of the skies about 10 p.m., your own 
kind of standard time, an hour earlier at 
the middle of the month and two hours 
earlier at the end. (Add one hour for day-
light saving time.)

The brightest of the trio is Venus, which 
remains visible low in the west for about 
two hours after sunset. Venus is now so 
brilliant (magnitude minus 3.6) on the as-
tronomical scale) that it appears long before 
any other star or planet.

Later in the evening, as Venus is about 
to descend below the western horizon, Ju-
piter will be more easily seen as it climbs 
a quarter as high as Venus, which still 
makes it many times brighter than any of 
the other planets. Later during the night 
Aquarius, the water carrier.

A little higher than Jupiter and farther 
south—across the border in the next-door 
constellation of Capricornus, the third 
planet of July evening is visible.

This is Saturn, now about a fifth as 
bright as Venus. Even so it equals a bright 
first-magnitude star.

Antares Appears in South
As for the stars, which shine by their own 
light (unlike the planets which are visible 
because of the sunlight they reflect to us), 
one that is very characteristic of evening 
in summer appears low in the south. This is 
Antares, in the group called Scorpius, the 
scorpion. The red color of the star makes it 
easy to identify. To the right of this group 
is a rather faint constellation—Libra, the 
scales—and to the right of it is Virgo, the 
Virgo. Here there is another bright star, 
also first magnitude, called Spica. And 
above Virgo, in Bootes, the herdsman, is 
still another: Arcturus.

High in the eastern sky—nearly overhead, 
in fact—is brilliant Vega, in Lyra, the lyre. 
Below it, and a little to the right, is Deneb, 
in Cygnus, the swan. Both of these stars 
are shown on the map of the northern sky. 
But near them, to the left of Deneb, and 
shown on the southern map, is Altair, in 
Aquila, the eagle. Vega, Altair and Deneb 
form a large and conspicuous triangle in 
the eastern sky these evenings.

Look to the northern map to see the familiar 
group of seven stars in Ursa Major, the 
great bear, called the great dipper. In the 
United States and Charles Wain in Eng-
land. Altair, Mizar and Alcoth (now as 
bright is the first magnitude) form the 

handle of the dipper. Double and Merak 
form the bowl. They are called the pointers 
because they indicate the direction of Polaris, 
the pole star, which is in Ursa Minor, the 
little bear.

On July 1 Mercury is farthest west of the 
sun, and can be seen above the eastern 
horizon for a few mornings around this 
time just before sunrise.

Neptune appears closest to earth and has 
reached first magnitude brightness. It is in 
Taurus, the bull, and rises in the east about 
three hours ahead of the sun.

Neptune is closest in July, at a distance 
of 830,700,000 miles on the 31st, when it 
will be directly opposite the sun. But al-
though it is in Libra, its magnitude is 7.7, 
too faint to be seen with the naked eye.

And on July 4 the earth is at "aphelion," 
or farthest from the sun for the year, at 
a distance of 94,453,000 miles. Despite this 
we are now having summer in the North-
ern Hemisphere, because the sun now climbs 
high into our sky and its rays fall more 
directly on the ground than they do in 
winter. And it takes longer from sunrise to 
sunset, which also increases its heating effect.

Although July brings two eclipses, prob-

ably few of our readers will see either of 
them. The first, on July 17, is a "penum-
bral" eclipse of the moon. The second comes 
July 31, when there is an "annular" eclipse 
of the sun.

The sun, the center of the earth, and the moon 
will be in line in two parts. In the center is the 
dark body of the moon, and around it, com-
pletely black the sun's light on the moon. 
Around this is the "penumbra," where the 
planet blocks out only part of the sun's light.

Full Moon Opposite Sun
Every time the moon is full, it is in the 
opposite part of the sky from the sun. Then 
its entire sunlit half is visible to us. Gen-
erally, however, it passes completely above 
or below the shadow. Sometimes, however, 
as it does in July and August, it enters the 
penumbra, but not the umbra, and this is 
a penumbral eclipse.

On other occasions, part of the moon 
enters the umbra, which causes a partial 
lunar eclipse. And sometimes there is a total 
eclipse, when it is completely immersed in 
the umbra. With an umbral eclipse, either 
part or total, the shaded part of the moon 
is noticeably darkened. But when it enters 
the penumbra, as it will on July 17, there 
is still so much sunlight falling upon it that 
it shines almost as usual. Only a keen eye 
can detect that it is somewhat dimmed.

The moon's shadow, too, has both an

E FIELDS

NUTRITION
Location of Milk
In Store Changes Taste

▶ THE TASTE of milk bought in grocery stores can depend on where the carton is located on the display shelf, three University of California food scientists have found.

Light from white fluorescent lamps, the kind commonly used in grocery display cases, can change the taste of milk even in cardboard cartons. However, the unpleasant flavor develops only in the outside cartons close to the lamp, and sometimes does not develop at all.

"Some types of cartons and some lamps are worse than others," Walter Dunkley told the Institute of Food Technologists meeting in Miami Beach, Fla. The effects are hard to pin down, he reported, and the flavor change can be confused with others.

Temperature, length of exposure, freshness of the milk, the cow's diet and many other factors also can affect development of light flavor, which occurs under commercial conditions often enough to create an occasional milk quality problem.

The flavor changes created by fluorescent lamps are similar to those caused by sunlight, which have been known for years. Nutrient value of the milk is also reduced by prolonged exposure to high-intensity fluorescent light.

J. D. Franklin and R. M. Pangborn, also of the University of California, cooperated with Mr. Dunkley in the milk-flavor studies.

SOCIOLOGY
Fla., Calif., Great Lakes
Rival E. Coast in 1980

▶ THREE WIDESPREAD urban areas will challenge the Atlantic Seaboard region in population within 20 years.

The Great Lakes region extending from Green Bay, Wis., to Rochester, N. Y., with an estimated 37,000,000 persons in 1961, the Florida area from Miami to Tampa-St. Petersburg, with 10,000,000 and California, from the Mexican border to San Francisco, with 27,000,000 persons, will approach the size of the East Coast strip.

The Atlantic Seaboard, sometimes called the city 500 miles long, extends from Portland, Me., to Washington, D.C. This area now contains more than 36,000,000 persons and by 1980 the population should reach nearly 50,000,000. The area is now growing as fast as the other three areas, however.

While the East Coast area is growing 15%, each 10 years, other urban communities are climbing more than 40% during the same time, according to Dr. Jerome L. Pickard, research director of the Urban Land Institute, Washington, who has looked into the future of America's population.

There are now 21 regions in the country with a total population of 97,600,000; or 55% of the nation's population is living on six percent of the nation's land area, he said. By 1980 these areas will have 170,000,000 persons.

None of the urban regions in the country are experiencing a population decline, he pointed out. Thus a new level of thinking will be required to plan for increased transportation, air and water pollution and many other necessary items associated with such an expanding population.

EDUCATION
Method Is Not at Fault
When Johnny Can't Read

▶ IF IT IS TRUE that American Johnny can't read, it is not because American schools teach reading primarily by "look-say" method to the neglect of the widely advocated "phonics" method.

This is the conclusion of a conference of 28 reading specialists supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and under the chairmanship of Dr. James B. Conant, well known educator. The report of the conference, entitled "Learning to Read," was issued by the Educational Testing Service at Princeton, N.J.

It is not true, the report declares, that our schools, in general, use primarily a "sight-word" method. It is not true that our schools, in general, do not teach phonics. The teaching of reading in our schools is not all uniformly good, the report indicates. Some is excellent, much is good, and some is poor. But it is not so bad as pictured by critics who present exceptions as typical examples.

When reading instruction is not good, the main reason is not the method. It is the shortage of good teachers—a plague that affects all educational institutions from books and supplies, and poor public support—both moral and financial.

HORTICULTURE
Flowers Fooled With
Flashing Lights

▶ FLASHING LIGHTS have been used to prevent flowers from blooming too soon.

The plants were exposed to artificial flashing lights during one-tenth of the night but reacted as though it were full daylight.

Dr. Thomas J. Sheehan, ornamental horticulturist at the Florida Agricultural Experiment Stations, has been working with this system to find out whether flower producers can keep the flowers from blooming more economically. The process now requires the lights full time to keep from blooming until time of greatest market demand.

AUTOMATION
Russia Hopes to Surpass
U.S. via Automation

▶ THE SOVIET UNION'S main hope of surprising the U.S. industrial production lies with the development of adaptive control or "think" automation, a professor at Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind., believes.

This most advanced type of automation, with machinery which can "look over" a situation and teach itself to improve, is gaining impetus both in the United States and Russia, Dr. John E. Gibson, electrical engineer who visited the Soviet's major automation research center, said. But the Russians are necessarily putting more emphasis on it.

"Russia today has very few Detroit-type assembly lines and plants," he explained. "And the plan is to go from a peasant, job-shop economy directly into a highly automated factory economy."

There are six institutes being set up to automate each of the six leading industries in Russia. With huge numbers of engineers being turned out of the universities every year, they expect to completely skip the present production system on which the present American economy is based.

Can they do it? Dr. Gibson believes they can, just as they jumped from behind in the air to develop the intercontinental ballistic missile. He reported these beliefs in Backgrounder from Purdue.

ASTRONOMY
Test Seen for Einstein's
Theory of Gravity Waves

▶ A CHANCE TO TEST the part of Einstein's theory of general relativity that predicts the existence of gravitational waves is seen in a mysterious flaring star 500 trillion miles away in a system known as Nova Sagittae, which consists of two stars and has the shortest known period of orbital motion—only 81 minutes are required for one revolution of the eclipsing system. One is a dense white dwarf star, the other is not observable optically.

The stars are believed to be rotating around a common center so fast—1,500,000 miles an hour—that energy is radiated as gravitational waves. Nova Sagittae is very faint and astronomers have not been able to determine whether the second object is the pair in another dwarf star, or a ring with a lump in it rotating around the white dwarf. The entire system is much smaller than the sun.

Drs. Robert P. Kraft and Jesse L. Green, astronomers at Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories, Pasadena, Calif., with Dr. Jon Matthews, California Institute of Technology physicist, collaborated in pointing out the significance of Nova Sagittae in probing part of the general relativity theory. The star is known as a recurrent nova that flared nearly to naked eye visibility in 1913 and 1946.
