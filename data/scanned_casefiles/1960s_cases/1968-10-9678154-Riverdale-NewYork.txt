The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration appears to be a compass or radar display with various directional labels. The bottom illustration depicts a person standing on a road or path, with blurred or hazy landscapes in the background on either side.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE IN THE CENTER OF THIS COMPASS. THIS IS WHAT A PERSON WOULD SEE STANDING IN THE CENTER OF A STRAIGHT LINE AT THE TIME HE FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS STATIONARY AND HOVERED OVERHEAD WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND AS THE WITNESS TURNED SLOWLY HIS POSITION INDICATES THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT CAME AND TO WHICH IT WENT. THIS DRAWING IS DESIGNED TO INDICATE HOW A WITNESS CAN POINT OUT THE DIRECTION OF SIGHTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

THE SKETCH BELOW SHOWS AN APPEARANCE AS OBSERVED AND DRAWN BY THE WITNESS. IT PURPORTS TO REPRESENT AN OBJECT THAT APPEARS STATIONARY AND HOVERED OVER THE WITNESS WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND THEN MOVED OFF IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED ON THE COMPASS ABOVE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF LOCATION OF SIGHTING.

The image shared appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch is accompanied by a caption that reads "And sometimes that directed".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

APR 30

IF DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOHENA. INCLUDE MARKINGS AND LABEL 
HAVE APPEARED AS SEEN OR PHOTOSRAPS. AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE DIRECT ION THE MOVEMENT WAS MOVING.

IA. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE. HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF THE FACE. MEASURE THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT BY THE MATCH. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE MATCH THE OBJECT COVERS. THIS WILL GIVE THE ANGULAR SIZE. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH THE OBJECT COVERS.
