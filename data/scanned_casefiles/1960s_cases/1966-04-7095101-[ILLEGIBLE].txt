Dear Mr. [redacted]

I am enclosing the photographs of alleged unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which you submitted for evaluation.

Again, the images appear genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena); however, it is not possible to determine the cause or nature of the objects.

These photographs are so similar to those submitted in your April 10, 1966 observation that we did not send them to our photographic analysis. Although it is just a guess, a likely cause for the imagery is a small man-made object thrown into the air and photographed.

Also enclosed is the 1967 report on Project Blue Book which I think you will find interesting.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP

TO: Bev Cassel

REMARKS:
Mr. [redacted] submitted photographs of an alleged UFO. Photographic analysis revealed that a likely cause for the imagery was some type of man made object which was thrown into the air and photographed. Mr. [redacted] informed of our findings by correspondence to you on 8 Feb 67.

Mr. [redacted] has written to President Johnson, Senator Phillips [redacted], and Project Blue Book many times. Now he has sent ten photographs of alleged UFOs for us to analyze. These, again, look like something thrown into the air and photographed. Could you possibly send a letter to this fellow and have him get off our backs? I have enclosed the last group of photos. There is no need to send these to photo analysis.

SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/bp/T9079/14 Feb 67

FEB 15 1967

Dear Mr.

We have completed our evaluation of your April 10, 1966 observation and photograph of an alleged unidentified flying object.

Although the image appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena) it was not possible to determine the cause or nature of the object. It was interesting to note however that you were approximately 300 feet from the object which was estimated to have a velocity of 800 mph. Although you state there was no sound, a sonic boom would occur at that speed. Also noteworthy is the fact that although the photograph was a significant degree of "panning", the object exhibits rather clear outlines rather than smearing or blurring as would be expected when a fast moving object is photographed.

Although it is a matter for conjecture, a more likely cause for the imagery is a rather small man made object which was thrown into the air photographed.

It appears that the photograph is not of the object observed by the witness as concluded from the above analysis. A positive identification of the object observed has not been made. There is no evidence to indicate that any extraterrestrial vehicle was observed.

I am enclosing your negative and prints. We appreciate your interest in our program.

Proposed reply to letter from Gregory Gulyas

Dear Mr. [redacted]

We have completely analyzed the 10 April 1966 observation and photograph of an alleged unidentified flying object. Although the images appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena) it was not possible to determine the cause or nature of the object. It was interesting to note, however, that source stated he was approximately 300 feet from the object which was estimated to have a velocity of 800 mph.

Although he stated there was no sound, a sonic boom at that time could not be ruled out. Also noteworthy is the fact that although the foreground tree parts show no significant degree of "panning," the object exhibits rather clear outlines rather than smearing or blurring as would be expected when a fast moving object is photographed.

Although it is a matter for conjecture, a more likely cause for the imagery is a rather small man made object which was thrown into the air and photographed.

It appears that the photograph is not of the object observed by the witness as concluded from the above analysis. A positive identification of the object observed has not been made. There is no evidence to indicate that any extraterrestrial vehicle was observed.

I am inclosing your negatives and prints. We appreciate your interest in our program.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR. 66-52
DATE OF REPORT 28 November 1966

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Garden City, Michigan    DATE 10 April 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF                IR                  QUALITY Poor
P NRB Two negatives (B&W) and two 8x10 prints

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to a request by Major Quintanilla (TDERP) to determine the most likely cause of the images in subject photography.

2. ANALYSIS: Although the images appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena) it was not possible to determine the cause or nature of the object. It was interesting to note, however, that source stated he was approximately 300 feet from the object which was estimated to have a velocity of 500 mph. Although he stated that there was no sound, a sonic boom might well have been expected. Also noteworthy is the fact that although the foreground tree parts show no significant degree of "panning", the object exhibits rather clear outlines rather than smearing or blurring as would be expected when a fast moving object is photographed. Although it is a matter for conjecture, a more likely cause for the imagery is a rather small man-made object which was thrown into the air and photographed.

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
22 September 1966

Brookville, Indiana 47012

Dear Mr.

Reference your letter of 5 May 1966 reporting your 12 April observation of an unidentified flying object over the Brookville, Indiana area.

I regret this delay in answering your inquiry, but due to the present heavy workload I am just beginning to catch up with my correspondence.

Your description is consistent with that of an aircraft. All aircraft have a rotating beacon used for anticollision purposes. This beacon is red in color and would definitely give the appearance of a beacon on a police car.

You mentioned the fact that the object appeared to reflect sunlight at midnight. After having contacted Aircraft Specialists at Wright-Patterson AFB, I feel that you could have observed an aircraft that had turned on its landing lights. These landing lights are quite bright and would have given the impression of sun being reflected from its surface.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

5/13/66

Gentlemen,

After thinking this matter over since April 13th I've decided to write you at approx. 12:05AM 4/12/66 I saw what I thought to be a satellite except it had a red light. The red light it seemed, now went completely off but looked like the red flasher light on a police car. It was traveling at approx. 40°-45° to the horizon and came from S.W. to N.E. The estimated time this swath of this was probably 3 1/2 min. there's a walnut tree I'm gorden and it traveled along in parallel with the first

Climb on this tree and about 350-400 ft. NE of this tree it went out of sight behind some trees that form a well shape. The discounted this being a meteorite or I've seen many of these and they only last a few seconds. Again do not have flashing red lights, I do not have delusions. It knew we had aircraft that would reflect sunlight at mid-night I would not have bothered to write you. I felt I should however. After all this news recently, I do not want you to release this letter or any part of it to anyone. After you do finish with it please destroy same.

Here is the text from the document:

k. Position title and comments of the preparing officer, including preliminary analysis of the possible cause of sighting(s):

2d Lt Santana, OD: Persons making the report seem reliable persons.
1st Commander Hageman from Corpus Christi first received the report as it was relayed to him by FAA supervisor. He then relayed the report to this command post. The general description and movement of the object does not seem to coincide with any type of known aircraft. Aside from that I have no idea of what could have caused the sighting.

1. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs.

None.
