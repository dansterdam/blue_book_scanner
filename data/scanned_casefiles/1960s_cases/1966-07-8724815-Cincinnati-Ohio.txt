If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would it have covered? Angular size unknown.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the objects that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a series of illustrated diagrams and instructions related to a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The diagrams include a curved line with measurement points indicating the height of an observed object above the horizon, a compass, and a series of shapes representing multiple objects and their direction of travel.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
