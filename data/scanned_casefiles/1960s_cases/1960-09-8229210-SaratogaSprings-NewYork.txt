10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
2 objects about 5 mi apart, size of planet Mars, bright red. Bright red color appeared below to from approximately and the color was streaked, but did not appear to be exhaust. Objects seemed to zig zag. Both objects disappeared by falling below the horizon.

11. COMMENTS
Possibility that object which was first observed was planet Venus. As the planet was below horizon when first seen, was responsible for distortion and apparent motion causing the observation. Bright objects distorted by atmospheric refraction in 2 cal N. The bright star Spica (Virgo) was probably one of objects distorted by atmospheric refraction. In this way a Venus and Spica could account for the difference.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft
Was Astronomical
Probably Astronomical
