Here is the text from the document:

1. Did you notice any unusual activity or conditions, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting: "Slight" comet saw pieces of this which appeared as a falling star.

L. Did you take any photographs: No
Do you know of any existence of physical evidence of materials: None

INITIALS: EH

ADDITIONAL REMARKS BY OBSERVER: Also observed by [redacted] wife, age 37, age 16.

COMMENT: This "Slight" comet appeared to be calm about this. He was looking at the report to this reporter the coloration of flashing red, green, white gives the impression this could have been an aircraft, the duration of this sighting seems to discount this. The observer did not appear to be hesitant of what he saw.

Attention:

Gentlemen:

This will confirm my telephone conversation with one of your principals of this morning in which we reported the sighting of what we would classify an unidentified flying object.

The sighting was made by Mrs. and Mr. at Prospect Heights, Illinois, at approximately 12 p.m. last night, August 11, and the object was viewed for approximately two hours, or until 2 a.m., August 12.

The first reaction upon sighting was that it was a plane a long distance off and approaching directly with a red flashing light on the left, a green flashing light on the right, and what appeared to be a white flashing light in the center.

It was located almost due northeast and approximately 30° above the horizon. Over the period of two hours, it moved approximately 30 degrees east and 30 degrees up. At the final viewing, when we decided to quite and go to bed, it was located what I would say to be north -- 65 degrees east and 60 degrees above the horizon. It still appeared to be the same in figuration, although at such distance it was not possible to determine any shape and at a distance almost comparable to a star, except that you could very definitely see the red, green, and white flashing lights.
