928 Troop Carrier Group, (Medium Reserve)
United States Air Force
O'Hare International Airport

Attention: 
Gentlemen:

This is to confirm my telephone conversation with one of your principles of this morning in which we reported the sighting of what we would classify an unidentified flying object.

The sighting was made by Mrs.  and Mr.  at Prospect Heights, Illinois, at approximately 12 p.m. last night. August 11, 1965.

The first reaction upon sighting was that it was a plane a long distance off and approaching directly with a red flashing light on the left side on the object and steady white lights on the other side.

It was located almost due northeast and approximately 30째 above the horizon. Over the period of two hours, it moved approximately 65 degrees east and 20 degrees above the horizon. It still appeared to be north - 65 degrees east and 30 degrees above the horizon. Although at such distance it was not possible to determine any shape and color distinction, we did observe the object to be long and slim and while flashing lights.
