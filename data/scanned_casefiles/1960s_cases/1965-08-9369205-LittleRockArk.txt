SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 16 August 1965, Little Rock, Arkansas 

TO: HQ USAF SAPODC (Mrs Hunt)

Mrs Hunt has requested an evaluation of his report on the UFO sighting in Little Rock, Arkansas. This observation is evaluated as a satellite. The description, duration and direction of flight are consistent with this analysis. The project has coordinated this finding with other reporting agencies and evaluated meteorological, astronomical, or atmospheric conditions, such as an inversion. There are more than thirty satellites visible at times which are visible to the naked eye.

Dear Sir,

I am very interested in the unusual sightings of unidentified flying objects which my family and I have observed. It is the first time I have reported anything like this, but this is the closest approximation to describe what we saw.

The object looked like a large star that was very slightly larger, with a very slightly bluish white color.

The sighting was at about 7:35 P.M. Monday, August 16, 1965.

The object looked like it moved or traveled at a very high rate of speed up and then disappeared from view. I would appreciate it if you would send me some report forms under my report number.

Sincerely,
[redacted]

LARRY KENNON has requested an evaluation of his report on the sighting of 16 August 1965 over Little Rock, Arkansas. This observation is detailed in an attached letter from LARRY KENNON. The description and observations are such that this flight can be attributed to an illusion as one light passes another or some other meteorological condition. There are no unusual features to this report that would indicate the presence of an unusual aircraft.
