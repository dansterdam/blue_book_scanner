[Partially redacted text] has requested an evaluation of his report on the night of 16 August 1965 over Little Rock, Arkansas. This observation is an evaluated as a satellite. The description, duration and direction of flight are in accord with this analysis. The zig-zag flight can be attributed to an illusion as one light passes another or atmospheric conditions, such as an inversion. There are more than thirty estimated satellite components in orbit which are visible to the naked eye.
