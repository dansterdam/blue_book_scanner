   One: 1 star, 20,000 ft. color-white,   sighting was made, no known a/c in area.
   similar to second to 21,000 ft.         Possibly balloon launched by Communist
   Compared to police observer (1).        territory, on 15 Nov. Balloons are
   Showed no color features, normal        launched in an area 58 of Japan. Due
   movement of white light against star    to inability to correlate sighting with
   background. Angle h5° to North, az-     unknown object, report is evaluated as
   imuth fm 350° to 30° when sighted.      unidentifiable.
   About 15° above horizon, appeared to
