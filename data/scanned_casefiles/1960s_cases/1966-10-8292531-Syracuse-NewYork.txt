34. Date you completed this questionnaire:     12     October     1967
                                                      Day         Month       Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Ques. 5 #2. The object made 2-1 minute flights over the city. After completing the first flight it vanished momentarily, then re-appeared, made the second flight and did not return. Both flights were made within a 5 minute period.

Ques. 10 & 11. In answer to #10 I stated that the object appeared solid. In answer to #11, the object did not appear as a light but was much brighter than the brightest stars.

Ques. 13. The object did not change brightness at any time. As it receded toward the eastern horizon and therefore was moving away from me, the object would naturally appear smaller and less outstanding as the distance between it and my position increased.

Since I took the photograph of this object, I have observed various types of aircraft at night and have attempted to photograph their lights. As of the above date I have not seen anything that resembled the object and all of the negatives were returned completely blank.

My eyesight and hearing are excellent and I can hear the engine of a jet plane flying at such high altitude that it is almost impossible to see its lights. Considering the apparent size of the object in question, if there was any type of known propulsion involved I am positive I would have been able to hear it.

Dear Sir:

The following is a description of a possible UFO which I witnessed and photographed the night of October 26, 1966. Enclosed please find 1 Kodacolor print, 1 Kodacolor slide, 1 photocopy of a letter written by a resident of Manlius, New York with whom I am not acquainted, 1 sketch of the object's flight pattern and a self-addressed, stamped envelope.

DATE OF SIGHTING: October 26, 1966
TIME OF SIGHTING: 9:30 P. M. Eastern Standard Time

I was in the back yard of my home, located at the above address, photographing the moon using an Exa with a Wirgar f=135 mm, 1:4.5 lens set at infinity with an opening of 4.5 at 1/50 a second, and a pair of 7 X 50 binoculars. Turning away from the moon which had already crossed the zenith, I saw a brilliant, silvery white light approaching slowly from the east approximately 20° above the horizon. The brightness of the light was comparable to an automobile headlight at a distance of 75' when set on high beam. It did not appear to stand still at any time, alter its speed, break up or explode, leave a visible trail, change shape or pulsate. As it approached the zenith, the light lost its silvery appearance and became milky white but did not lose its brilliance.


- page 6 -

Although I did not see a definite shape, this object, if it can properly be classified as such, did not move in front of or behind anything and appeared to be solid. I wear eyeglasses and observed the object through 7 X 50 binoculars which did not reveal any shape or clue to its identity. The area was exceptionally quiet and I heard no sound of any kind during the entire sighting. The apparent size of the object was comparable to a baseball held at arm's length and appeared to grow smaller as it receded toward the eastern horizon.

I was outdoors during the entire sighting in a residential area of the city and was facing east when the object appeared and disappeared. The sky was clear with a few stars, full moon, no clouds, haze or wind. The weather was dry and cold. No one was with me at the time of the sighting. I cannot estimate the speed or distance of the object although the slowness and sharp turn made by it would, in my opinion, rule out a conventional aircraft. The object made 2 identical flights over the city and vanished in the area in which it first appeared. Each flight took approximately 1 minute and both flights took place within a 5 minute period. I have enclosed a slide as well as a print of the object because it was not discernible as I studied the object through binoculars and did not show up on the print; however, the slide when projected shows a purple glow completely surrounding the object. Any information you can give concerning the nature of this object would be appreciated.

My name is [redacted]. I am 32 years old, a High School graduate and am employed as a Clerk-Typist in the [redacted] of a local bank, a position I have held for 14 years.

Another UFO?
Airport 'scorns' sightings

To the Herald-Journal:
I am writing to you in reference to the article entitled, "UFO sightings" that was printed in the Oct. 30 edition.

On the night of Oct. 25, 1966, I observed a mere white dot behaving in a somewhat unusual manner. It would recede to the eastern horizon and come back to just about overhead. I was intrigued by the object and drove over to a friend's house. He studied it for a time and some of his relatives were witnesses to it also.

I called Hancock Airport and a man answered politely and asked me what I was calling for. At first I told him or rather asked him if he had had any sightings or knew of any research missions in the area. He said no. Then I inquired as to the laws regarding lights on planes. He said they were required—both Air Force and commercial—to have flashing lights. I then told him what I have stated so far. He then stated that there are not, nor have been any such things as UFOs.

My point is this:
• When a person has alleged to have seen something the only reaction he ever receives from the monitors at Hancock Field is one of scorn and negative views. I don't maintain that there are UFOs but maybe some of these people who have seen something—whether it be of this earth or not should be listened to out of courtesy and because maybe the facts do exist.

GREG SMITH,
Manlius.

UFO Observation, 26 October 1966

Miss
Syracuse, New York 13207

1. This replies to your correspondence of August 31, 1967 on your unidentified flying object observation of October 26, 1966. Your slide was examined by photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB with the following results.

a. The cause of the image on the film cannot be positively determined. It consists of one bright circular disk of light surrounded by several streaks. These streaks are part of the image and not accidental in the emulsion. There is also a vater or air bubble in the emulsion. A comparison of the slide and the color print indicates that the streak patterns are somewhat different and possibly printed from separate negatives. Also, the vater does not appear on the color print. Suggested cause of the bright circular disk image was possibly the result of the camera being focused on a strong light source. The original color material is not available. Without this material, no further meaningful analysis into the possible cause of the imagery can be made.

2. No further investigation into your observation will be made since your sighting occurred in October 1966 and aircraft records, weather data, and other vital files are not kept for over thirty days in most instances.

3. Enclosed are your slide, print and one enlargement. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

One 35mm colored slide and one 3½ inch by 5 inch colored print.

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order Number 67-135 submitted by Major Quintanilla, AETR, which requested an analysis be made on the submitted photo slide in order to identify object as was reported sighted at Syracuse, New York, 26 October 1966.

2. ANALYSIS: The cause of the image on the film cannot be positively determined. It consists of one bright circular disc of light surrounded by several streaks. These streaks are part of the image and not scratches in the emul. There is also a water or air bubble in the emulsion. A comparison of the slide and the color print indicate that the streak patterns are somewhat different and possibly printed separate negatives. Also, the very blurry does not appear on the bright circular disc image was possibly the result of the camera being focused on a strong light source.

The original color material is not available. Without this material, no further meaningful analysis into the possible causes of the imagery can be made.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound   There was absolutely no sound emitted at any time.
b. Color   Silver-white approaching zenith, became milky white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Less than half of a 1/2 section of the entire object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Since it is difficult to draw the arrow in proper perspective, the object as drawn is at a right angle to the ground; moving from East to West. Occasionally brilliant rays of light appeared to be emitted from the edges of this object. Since I have seen the identical phenomenon while observing the planet Venus, I would assume that they were optical illusions. As I stated in question 13, the object did not appear to flash or flicker when the rays of light were emitted. These rays were identical in color to the object.
