"Del Mar, California
17 November 1961

Dr. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

As requested by telephone, 16 November 1961, herewith is a summary of a sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred in the sky above my home in Del Mar, California, on 4 November 1961. It is listed in chronological sequence as it occurred.

4 November 1961: I was an FM observer for five years on duty at Lindbergh Field, San Diego, California. My observation was made from my home address above at about 1930 hours. I observed a light source that appeared to be moving erratically across the sky in the direction of La Jolla and extending NE to SW in direction toward the ocean. This direction of movement was approximately a true north direction, and altitude was estimated at from 5 to 10 degrees. My description of the standard "signature" or characteristics of this light source was as follows:

The light source was brilliant white or bluish-white in color, much brighter than the surrounding stars. It appeared to be disc-shaped, with a uniform circumference and an estimated diameter of approximately 10 feet. The light emitted from this object was brilliantly clear and intense and gave the impression of being a self-luminous or self-illuminated source of light, rather than reflected light.

The light source was in motion and moved across the sky in a somewhat erratic or rather jittery manner, but did not leave any trail or exhaust. The light intensity remained constant until it disappeared from my observation area, approximately 30 to 45 seconds later. The light source disappeared rather abruptly, leaving no visible trace.

4 November 1961: About 2000 hours from the patio of my home, address above, I observed a vertical "fire-trail" at an azimuth of about 200 degrees or about 20 degrees west of south, an elevation of about 40 to 50 degrees. This observation lasted about 15 seconds. The "fire-trail" was very short, narrow, and of a uniform intense white color. It flashed abruptly, was intense, and then disappeared abruptly, with no residual glow or afterglow. There was no fireball visible, no buildup in the "fire-trail" that is, the beginning and end were both abrupt. The "fire-trail" was visible over its entire length, about 10 to 15 feet. No noise, sparks, or marks trailing from the light source were visible. The light contrasted sharply with the surrounding starry sky, and disappeared rather abruptly from an aircraft, but the angular velocity and geometry of this observation was consistent with a very rapid, high-speed maneuver: the observation was consistent, however, with a high-intensity burnout from about 20 to 30 miles in the upper atmosphere. As the "fire-trail" lasted less than 20 seconds, it would have travelled a distance of at least 3 to 4 thousand feet, and accounting a constant velocity of say, 1500 feet per second as possible, i.e., a velocity of 1000 to 3000 feet per second. This "fire-trail" appeared to be quite intense and abrupt in its beginning and end, and gave the impression of being a luminous mass, rather than a mere streak or trail. None of these phenomena were observed in less than thirty seconds. None of these phenomena were associated in any way with the previous observation as to time, direction, or characteristics; they appeared to be completely separate and unrelated. I am certain that what I observed were not reflections, aircraft, nor any known astronomical phenomena. The nature and characteristics of these events lead me to the conclusion that they were of some sort of an aerospace nature, and for some reason, on this hypothesis."

6 November 1961: About 1900 hours, a pilot observed a light but bright trail in the sky off the Pacific horizon. The trail was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes and then disappeared. The pilot was returning to Del Mar, California. This was observed in the North East sky from the parking lot of the County Del Mar Racing location. There was nothing unusual about the light and it was initially thought to be an airplane. No further investigation was done.  

8 November 1961: About 2100 hours, the observer reported another unidentified sighting. The sighting had a signature identical to that observed on 6 November 1961 and was observed in the same general area. The object appeared to be moving at a higher velocity than normal jet aircraft and made no sound. It was observed for approximately 2 minutes and then disappeared. No further investigation was conducted.

The document describes in detail the sightings on November 6 and November 8, 1961 near Del Mar, California. It provides information about the time, location, and characteristics of the unidentified objects observed.

Description of direction is not necessarily inconsistent with such a direction since he was near the area of the trajectory and a slight correction in direction. 11 November 1961: About 1:55 hours four observers witnessed a fire trail of bright objects to the northeast. The objects appeared to be above the horizon, about 60 degrees above the horizontal. The trace was almost horizontal, moving almost north to south. The objects were equidistant from each other and were traveling at very high speed. 

On the evenings of these sightings the weather was very warm and the sky brilliantly clear. One to what is locally termed the Corona area, elevation, a point over 1,000 feet elevation, a point just below some scattered showers was in progress between 1200 and 2200 hours, all having very clear trace and angular velocity of two to three times that of aircraft. This phenomenon was also described as hazy in appearance, distinctly visible over a distance of hundreds of miles by various observers in France.

They request that some are of publicity in San Diego county may prove to be responsible for making the determination before me on the subject. In any case, they request that I refrain from promoting any publicity on the subject.

Witness: WITNESS Phows THAT THESE WERE UNUSUAL, THAT THEY WERE REAL, AND THAT THEY WERE SIGHTING BY TWO ESTABLISHED WITNESSES - IT STATES THAT THESE OBJECTS MOVED AND MANEUVERED IN A MANNER THAT RULES OUT CONVENTIONAL CRAFT.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OTHER COUNTRIES INDICATE THAT NO WEAPON COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO CREATE THE EFFECTS REPORTED. IT WAS ALSO SEEN BY TWO OF OUR CREW.
THERE WERE STRANGE METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THESE WERE REAL SIGHTINGS AND ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN COINCIDENCE.

Part 1: Sources:
Source A: Mr. [redacted], Missile Expert assigned to the General Atomic Division, Convair Atlas Plant, San Diego, California. Telephone [redacted] ext. [redacted]
Source B: Mr. [redacted], Convair Plant Nr 1. Telephone Nr: [redacted] ext. [redacted]
Source C: Mr. [redacted], FAA Contractor, San Diego Approach Control.

Part 2: On 3 occasions, 4, 6, and 7 Nov 61 Source A saw what he considered to be a missile trajectory. All observations were between the hours of 2000 and 2100 local time. Weather at the time of each sighting was CAVU. Source A stated that: all three sightings were approximately three seconds in duration and were the brightest things that he had ever seen. Each sighting appeared to be the same; that is an upside down missile trajectory which appeared to send smoke or falling parts in its lighted trail. He offers as a possibility some sort of collision on the recently vehicle.

Part 3: On the night of 6 Nov 61 Source A was standing in his back yard when he observed the UFO. Being a former artillery man he measured the trajectory in miles by use of his fingers. His estimate of the trajectory was that it was at least 500 miles in length and possibly 1 1/2 to 2 miles in width. He states that his line of vision was WSW and at an angle of approximately 22 1/2° to the horizon. He determined track by with respect to his home and the angle of sight by measuring the distance from where he stood at the time of observation; the height of his house and determining the angle by trigonometry.
(Note: Missile trail length could conceivably be greater than 500 miles as Source states that it disappeared from his line of sight behind the top of his home).

Part 4: On 7 Nov Source A [redacted] started asking and calling others to see if they had observed similar UFO's. As a result a contact with Source C revealed to Source A that Source C had seen a UFO on the night of 3 Nov 61 from Lindburgh [sic] Tower Municipal Field. An interview with Source C revealed the following information:

Time: between 2000 and 2100 hours local.
Weather: CAVU.
Sighting: high.
Direction of sighting: SW.
Remark: Source C stated that it was similar to a meteor, but in all his experience he had never seen one so bright. He further stated that it appeared to emit smoke for about 10 seconds after the lighted trail disappeared.
Part 2: Source A states that he observed the same UFO on the night of 7 Nov and on 9 Nov, received a call from Source B, a good friend of Source A, had seen a similar UFO to the SW of his home. Source B was not available for interview.
Part 6: Source A states from consulting various members of the Convair Plant and utilizing the information available to him he estimates heights of UFO's to be in the vicinity of 100,000 to 150,000 ft. And that in that part of UFO's to be 30 miles N San Diego (sighting of 6 Nov 61), NE, and S of San Diego (did not specify which UFO's correlates to the sightings on 3, 7, and 8 Nov).
He further states that if some one is firing missiles for adjustment on San Diego, they have a perfect bracket, and are now ready to fire for effect.
Part 7: Due to other commitments, Intelligence this headquarters is unable to perform any additional collection efforts on this subject. Request you advise as to what format and what addresses you desire for dissemination of this material.
