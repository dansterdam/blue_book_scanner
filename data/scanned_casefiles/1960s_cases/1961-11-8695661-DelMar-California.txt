10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Objects reported by witness recently of any known satellites. Major witness missile recently, however they are closer to range than satellites. Witness suggests that these were practice shots fm some then it would be necessary to locate firing site in North America continent. Present info concerning that no weapon could have been fired along those less it was fired fm within this continent. Then sporadic fireball probably accounts for sightings.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft

Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

COMMENTS were definitely not caused by indicators that signatures are those of a thing meteors that missiles. Witness unknown source. If this theory is accepted of short which appeared to come fm within capabilities of other countries indicates that no weapon could have been fired. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT these meteor showers which occurred plus an occasional CLUSTER OF VERTICAL OBJECTS MAY BE FROM NAVAL MISSILE PRACTICE AT SAN CLEMENTE SECTOR.

Del Mar, California
17 November 1961

Dr Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr Hynek:

As you requested by telephone, 16 November 1961, herewith is a summary of the information on "fire-trail" sightings in the period 2-11 November. Although this information was acquired piecemeal, it is listed in chronological sequence as it occurred.

2 November 1961: an FA observer for five years, on duty in the tower at Lindberg Field, San Diego, observed between 2000 and 2100 hours a bright trail described as starting over Mount Soledad on the east side of La Jolla and extending NE to SW in direction toward the ocean. He was stationed that he had never before observed a trail characteristic and that my description of the standard "signature" of the three trails seen 2 November was similar. At the time of this sighting can be more closely established by consulting the log at Lindberg Field. The pilot works in communication with a pilot air base at the time. The pilot works for Conway, extension 1 in named.

4 November 1961 About 2000 hours from the patio of my home, address above, I observed a vertical "fire-trail" at an azimuth of about 200 degrees or about 20 degrees west of south, at elevations above the horizontal from about 40 to 20 degrees, mean elevation about 30 degrees. The trail was very broad, perhaps 3 to 5 miles wide (6400 miles equals 360 degrees), was traced out over a period of two or three seconds, then vanished abruptly with no afterglow. There was no fireball visible, no pulling in the trail, that is, the trail was uniform over its entire length and at the instant of disappearance was visible over its entire length. Stratifications or sparks trailed from edges of the trail. It was a brilliant white or blue white clear. There was no sound. My first thought was that the trail was that of a pyrotechnic projectile, common from an aircraft, but the angular velocity and geometry eliminated this possibility for any reasonable altitudes. The observation was consistent, however, with a reentry turnout from about 30 to 20 miles altitude and velocity of about 20,000 feet per second. On the latter basis as an assumption, the trail was about 50 miles from Del Mar. At such a range, the trail would have had to have been two or three hundred yards wide.

Returning to the hypothetical rocket hypothesis, and accepting a constant velocity of about 1500 feet per second as possible from, say, 3,000 to 6,000 feet altitude, one would expect to have seen either the aircraft or a rocket trail. Still, no luminous gas or have heard some sound within less than thirty seconds. None of these phenomena were observed and for near altitude, the uniform velocity of the trail was not compatible with much higher velocities in an atmospheric trajectory.

By consequence, I concluded that I had witnessed the reentry and burnout of one of the many satellites in orbit, a long, uniform trail of the vertical trace of the trail, and the uniform width were cause for some doubt on this hypothesis.

6 November 1961: About 1900 hours Air Controlman 1st observed a long bright trail with smoke NW of San Diego from the Pacific drive-in theatre in Pacific Beach, a location next to highway 101 and about on the traffic line between the Pacific Beach and La Jolla sections of San Diego.

The axis of the parking lot for patrons and the movie screen in this drive-in points somewhat south of southeast. Who is stationed at the North Island Air Station, a naval installation, was off duty at the time. He was beo/on duty in the tower at North Island at some time between 2-8 November, however, and was questioned therefore about any unusual sightings of fire trails. His report was passed on to by Commander Mcclin, Operations Officer at the Miramar Naval Air Base when I called first about the trails on 6 November 1961.

6 November 1961: About 2100 hours I observed another, the second, fire trail similar to the one observed on 6 November 1961 and at about the same vertical elevation, vertical span and horizontal width. I had 1/2, several mile wide, and with about the same angular velocity from a point on highway 101 off National City of San Diego. I was driving north on the highway and the section of the highway directly along which I observed the trail points along an azimuth of about 240 degrees, or about 20 degrees west of north. The description of the trail observed 6 November.

7 November 1961: About 2000 hours as I walked to my car in the north parking lot at General Atomic, which is located just east of highway 101 in Kearny Mesa in northern San Diego, I observed a white trail identical to the previous two sighted on 6 November except for one feature. Whereas the first two trails had been vertical, this trail tilted or arced slightly from the north to the south with a similar but noticeable direction. The direction of view was at an azimuth of about 250 degrees or thereabouts 20 degrees south of west. All other features of the sighting, that of the trailing edge, pitch, and any velocity were about the same as those of the two earlier sightings. A tangent to the arc at the center was at an angle from the horizontal of perhaps 70 or 80 degrees.

8 November 1961: About 2000 hours a trail was observed by three different persons, two in San Diego and one in Oceanside which in thirty miles north of San Diego. Thus, a trail was seen by one of a string of observers. The who also observed the 6 November trail, the drive-in theatre manager and others, described the trail as "northwest" from NE to SW. In Oceanside, two of the entire trail. In traceable by notes, I mistakenly gave the azimuth of this trail somewhat the 2 November trail as being SE of San Diego. The 8 November trail was described about as being SE of San Diego. The trail in Pacific Beach, telephone, was also traced through La Mesa, Palls, telephone.

Described the trail as "over Mission Beach", the San Diego Beach, just south of and adjacent to the works at Convair Elept. Telephone.

Observed the trail as a vertical trace to the south. Since both observers in Oceanside and San Diego observed a vertical trace, the line is roughly on a line through San Diego, and Oceanside, the direction is the direction of the Vandenberg peninsula.

description of direction as being NE to NW is not necessarily inconsistent
with such a direction since he was near the end of the trajectory and a
slight offset could produce a skewed impression of direction.

14 November 1961. About 1855 hours four observers witnessed a fire
trail of about the same description as the earlier sightings to the northwest, at about 60 degrees above the horizontal. The time was almost horizontal and was from right to left or from "south" to "north". The trail
was, according to Mr. Jacobs, a slight tilt of perhaps 30 degrees to
a northwestin line, above on the right or south and below on the north or left.
After discussing this point with Mr. Jacobs, I concluded that a question of
semantics could be involved and he was in general agreement. The trail (south)
to lower left (north) at a tilt of 30 degrees to the horizontal. AS far
as can be very difficult to interpret or even describe. The 16th of next month
half of the trajectory passed just below the bottom star in Cassiopeia.
Dr. _____ saw the trail from San Diego. A sixteen year old son and two
friends also saw the trail from Del Mar. A point about ten miles north of
its, from his experience. He said that the appearance of the trail also
agreed with my description of the standard "signature" of all the other
trail sightings.

On the evenings of these sightings the weather was very warm and the
sky brilliantly clear, due to what is locally termed a "Santa Anna" condition, a hot desert east wind. After my initial sighting on 2 November,
I spent several hours at different times in my patio to see if some sort
of meteoric shower was in progress between 1900 and 2200 hours.
During this entire watch period I saw only three small meteoric trails,
all having a very fine trace and angular velocity of two to three times that
the trails above described. All trails had the build-up in intensity so
characteristic of many subsequent trails and the arrival of gas recombination. I have seen one bolide, in France near Paris just before dusk
in 1957. This phenomenon bore no relation in its behavior to the sightings documented here. The bolide had a distinct and clearly visible fireball,
left a clearly visible trail, stopped and exploded with a sound audible
after an interval of time and was later reported to have been observed
over a distance of hundreds of miles by various observers in France.

May I suggest that some sort of publicity in San Diego County may serve
provide you with more information from more observers. My initial reaction
to the possible implications of these sightings to national security has
restrained me from promoting any publicity on the subject. In any case,
the preceding covers the information I have to date.

Yours,

WITNESS SUGGESTS THAT THESE WERE MINUTE SAMPLES FROM SOME UNKNOWN FORCES WHICH WERE FIRED.

THIS THEORY IS ACCEPTED THEN IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO LOCATE THE FIRING SITE OF THE SHOTS WHICH WERE PICKED UP TO COME FROM WITHIN THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT. PRESENT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CAPABILITIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES INDICATE THAT NO WEAPON COULD RANGE BEEN FIRED ALONG THEIR AZIMUTH WHICH COULD REACH THE AREA UNLESS IT WAS FIRED FROM WITHIN OUR CONTINENT.

THERE WERE SEVERAL METEOR SHOWERS WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE SIGHTINGS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THESE METERS PLUS AN OCCASIONAL SPORADIC FIREBALL PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR THESE SIGHTINGS.

Part 2. On 3 occasions, 4, 6, and 7 Nov 61 Source A saw what he considered to be a missile re-entry. All observations were between the hours of 2000 and 2100 local time. Weather at the time of each sighting was CAVU. Source A stated that: all three sightings were approximately three seconds in duration and were the brightest things that he had ever seen. Each sighting appeared to be the same; that is an upside down missile trajectory which appeared to send smoke or falling parts in its lighted trail. He offers as a possibility some sort of ablation on the re-entry vehicle.

Part 3. On the night of 6 Nov 61 Source A was standing in his back yard when he observed the UFO. Being a former artillery man he measured the trajectory in mills by use of his fingers. His estimate of the trajectory was that it was at least 500 mills in length and possibly 1 1/2 to 2 mills in width. He states that his line of vision was WSW and at an angle of approximately 22 1/2° to the horizon. He determined track ________with respect to his home and the angle of sight by measuring the distance from where he stood at the time of observation; the height of his house and determining the angle by trigonometry.

(Note. Missile trail length could conceivably be greater than 500 mills as Source states that it disappeared from his line of sight behind the top of his home.)

Part 4. On 7 Nov Source A [illegible text] started asking and calling others to see if they had observed similar UFO's. As a result a contact with Source C revealed to Source A that Source C had seen a UFO on the night of 3 Nov 61 from Lindburgh Tower Multiple Field. An interview with Source C revealed the following information:


- page 19 -

Time: between 2000 and 2100 hours local.

Weather: CAVU.

Sighting: high.

Direction of sighting: SW.

Remark: Source C stated that it was similar to a meteor, but in all his experience he had never seen one so bright. He further stated that it appeared to emit smoke for about 10 seconds after the lighted trail disappeared.

Part 5. Source A states that he observed the same UFO on the night of 7 Nov and on 9 Nov. Received a call from Source B stating that Source B, a good friend of Source A, had seen a similar UFO to the SW of his home. Source B was not available for interview.

Part 6. Source A states from consulting various members of the Convair Plant and utilizing the information available to him he estimates heights of UFO's to be in the vicinity of 100,000 to 150,000 ft. And that in that part of UFO's to be 30 miles W San Diego (sighting of 6 Nov 61), NW, NE, and S of San Diego (did not specify which UFO's correlates to the sightings on 3, 7, and 8 Nov.).

He further states that if some one is firing #1 missiles for adjustment on San Diego, they have a perfect bracket, and are now ready to fire for effect.

Part 7. Due to other commitments, Intelligence this headquarters is unable to perform any additional collection efforts on this subject. Request you advise as to what format and what addresses you desire for dissemination of this material.
