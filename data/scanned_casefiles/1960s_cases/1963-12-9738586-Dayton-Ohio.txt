FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
JAN-FEB 66

Resistencia

The three-man crew of a freight train had a strange experience between Presidente Madariaga and Resistencia, Province of El Chaco, according to the report (date not given), they beheld, walking along the railway track towards them, a tall being, "over 2 metres" in height, wearing a red one-piece garment. The driver slowed down, and all three were able to see this strange being, who, they assert, had a pale face, and was holding something before it. They thought at first that the object looked like the body of a small child. Suddenly, when the locomotive was not more than 5 metres away, the being disappeared "like a whirlwind, and vanished". Railway officials subsequently searched the area but found nothing. Meanwhile, in the town of Resistencia, a man named Justo Nasán reported to the authorities that on the same day, and at about the same hour, just as he and his ten-year-old daughter were about to take their supper in the garden, "a strange being descended towards them". In an interview with journalists, Nasán established that the figure was identical in all respects with the apparition seen by the train crew.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting over Michigan. The text states that a Mrs. Wayne Elliott observed an unusual object that she described as being the size and shape of a pancake. The object moved and then quickly disappeared from sight. The total observation time was about three minutes.

Pancake Shape Over Michigan
Mrs. Wayne Elliott, while driving her automobile on the outskirts of Grand Rapids, Michigan, sighted an unusual UFO on Monday, December 2, 1963.
According to her description, the object was shaped like a pancake and its altitude of about one half mile and was motionless. Mrs. Elliott said the size of this UFO was about the "same as a woman."
As the object moved, it tipped on edge and quickly disappeared from sight. The total observation time was about three minutes.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report on a "Mysterious Explosion At Tacoma" that occurred at around midnight on December 10, 1953. The text describes that the explosion was heard over a wide area of Tacoma, Washington, but no local citizens reported any air crashes or sightings. The report states that the usual number of inquiries were made by local citizens, but no air force planes were reported in the area at the time.

Mysterious Explosion 
At Tacoma

At approximately midnight on December 10, 1953, what sounded like an explosion was heard over a wide area of Tacoma, Washington. City and county officials were unable to determine the cause. However, the usual number of inquiries were made by local citizens. No Air Force planes were reported in the area at the time.

The image contains a hand-drawn illustration of a spinning object in the sky, along with the title "SPINDLE IN THE SKY" and the subtitle "TRICK OF LIGHT OR UFO MANIFESTATION?" The illustration appears to be a sketch or drawing rather than an actual photograph.

The image contains a photograph that is described in the accompanying text. The text mentions that the photograph was taken by Peter Davenport, a photographer at a television station. The photograph shows a mysterious object in the sky, described as the "shape". Photographic experts are said to declare that the object is not a reflection in the lens caused by the camera's design. The text also mentions that Peter Bolton took two photographs in which the mysterious object is visible, suggesting it is moving away from the Vulcan bomber. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the object is related to the Vulcan bomber. The text concludes that there is no evidence to support any conclusions about the relationship between the object and the Vulcan bomber.

As for the text in the document, it is as follows:

IN its issue for the week ending June 15 TODAY magazine reproduced a photograph taken by Peter Davenport, a photographer at a television station in Cannington, Utah. The time was 6 p.m. on December 12, 1963. A the bottom right-hand corner, it will be observed, is the "shape". Photographic experts declare that this is a reflection in the lens caused by the camera's design: it is certain in view of the fact that his camera is one of the most elaborate available and was "brighter".

Peter Bolton took two photographs in which this "shape" appeared. The mysterious object in these photographs, closer to the camera than the Vulcan bomber, are moving away from the Vulcan bomber.

All experts in both photographs appear to be in accordance with the Vulcan Bomber. There is, however, no evidence to support this. All objects in both photographs appear to be in accordance with the Vulcan Bomber.
