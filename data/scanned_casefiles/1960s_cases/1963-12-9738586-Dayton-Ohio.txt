FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 66

Dec 63
Argentina

Resistencia

The three-man crew of a freight train had a strange experience between Presidencia La Plaza and Resistencia, Province of El Chaco, according to several press reports. At 6.30 a.m. (precise date not given) they beheld, walking along the railway track towards them, a tall being, "over 2 metres high", wearing a red one-piece garment. The driver slowed down and all three were able to get a view of the stranger, who, they agree, had a pale face, long hair, and was holding something before him. Both hands "as though making an offering". They thought at first that the object when the locomotive was not more than 5 metres from the figure, it "shot up suddenly as though in a whirlwind", and "vanished". Railway officials subsequently searched the area but found nothing.

Meanwhile, in the town of Resistencia, a man named Justo Marin reported to the authorities that on the same day and at about the same hour, just as he and his fourteen-year-old son were about to take their supper in the garden, "a strange being" descended towards them. In an interview with journalists they described the entity, and it was established that the figure was identical in all respects with the apparition seen by the train crew.

Pancake Shape
Over Michigan

Mrs. Wayne Elliott, while driving her
automobile on the outskirts of Grand
Rapids, Michigan, sighted an unusual
UFO on Monday, 2 December 1963.

According to her description, the object was shaped like a pancake and glittered in the sun. It appeared to be at an altitude of about one half mile and was motionless. Mrs. Elliott said the size of this UFO was about the "same as a woman's compact."

When the object moved, it tipped on
edge and quickly disappeared from sight.
The total observation time was about
three minutes.

Mysterious Explosion
At Tacoma

At approximately midnight on December 10, 1963, what sounded like an explosion was heard over a wide area of Tacoma, Washington. City and county officials were unable to determine the cause. However, the usual number of inquiries were made by local citizens. No Air Force planes were reported in the area at the time.

SPINDLE IN THE SKY
TRICK OF LIGHT
OR
UFO MANIFESTATION?

Coningsby, Lincolnshire. 6 p.m. December 12, 1963

The image appears to be a sketch or drawing of an object, possibly a mechanical or aerial device, with somewhat indistinct lines and details.

Here is the text from the document:

IN its issue for the week ending June 13 Today magazine reproduced a photograph taken by Peter Bolton, 77 Times photographer, of a Vulcan bomber ready for action at Comingsby RAF station. The time was 6 p.m. on December 12, 1963. At the bottom right-hand corner, it will be seen, is a floodlight. At the top right-hand corner is the "shape". Photographic experts declare that it is a reflection in the lens caused by the floodlight.

On the other hand, the photographer was not so certain in view of the fact that his camera is one of the most elaborate available and was "hooded" to prevent any light interference.

Peter Bolton took two photographs in which this "shape" appeared. The mysterious object in one of the men is noticeably smaller than in the other, suggesting that it is moving away from the Vulcan bomber. The sceptic will probably try to explain this fact by suggesting that the floodlight alleged to be the cause of the "shape" has been moved in relation to the Vulcan Bomber. There is, however, no evidence to support this. All objects in both photographs appear to be in exactly the same relationship.
