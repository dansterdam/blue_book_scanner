1961

FIREBALL CAUSES NEAR-PANIC IN CALIFORNIA: In a widely-publicized incident last January 16th, a brilliant fireball was seen by thousands of people from San Diego to San Francisco, and as far as 300 miles inland in Nevada. The object was in the sky about 15 seconds, and was described in many different ways by the people who saw it. Inquiries from frightened citizens wrapped police and newspaper switchboards throughout the area. The sighting brought about a series of panicky reports that fires were raging in large portions of the state, caused by falling embers. Other reports, all later proved false, included finding of aerial debris in various places. A rising tide of panic seemed to overtake many generally reliable officials who were soon repeatedly frantically rumored. One version of the story was that the strange fireball had crashed into a densely populated section of Hollywood Hills. The truth seems to be that it either burned out or landed somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. No one is sure as to exactly what the object was, though it is assumed to have been natural in origin.

On January 16, 1951, another so-called giant meteor frightened thousands in California. The giant ball of fire trailed long multicolored tail and left an eerie bluish light after glow in the same area. It alarmed thousands of residents, already edgy because of recent unexplained phenomena. It was seen for 600 miles in California and at Las Vegas, Nevada, which is 300 miles inland. Many reported that the object didn't look like a meteor and that it appeared to be climbing in the sky, instead of burning itself out.
