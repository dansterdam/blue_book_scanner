Analysis and Conclusions:
THIS REPORT CONTAINS MUCH INFORMATION BUT SOME IS RATHER HARD TO ACCEPT. THE WITNESS COULD SEE THE LIGHT SOURCES WELL ENOUGH TO DETERMINE THEIR EXACT SHAPE. THIS INDICATES THEIR SIZE TO BE WELL DEFINED. THE OBJECT WHEN CLOSE WAS ABLE TO HOVER AND OTHER MOTIONS BE OF THE OBJECT. THE OTHER OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT TWO MILES AND WHAT SEEMS HAVE BEEN TRACKING AT GREAT SPEED, BUT THE WITNESS DIDN'T MENTION THIS FACT. (THE OBJECT WASN'T SURELY HAVE NOTED IN THIS CASE NEAR BEING CLOSE ENOUGH ELSE THE SMALL 30 TALL)

SUMMARY (Give concise summary of report, list key items, list enclosures)
1. Reference your message 4EXE-2570E, 26 August 1960. A further investigation as to other sightings and witnesses reveals UFO seen 23 August 1960 has completed with negative results. (The first investigation included interrogation of B-47 crew members airborne at time of Mr. [redacted] sighting and a check with ground radar site in the Hutchinson, Wichita area).

21 [redacted] age 37 years, and family [redacted] (wife-age 34 years) [redacted] daughter - age 12) and [redacted]

August 1960 when they noticed an object coming from approximately a northerly direction at an angle of 040° elevation. They reported that UFO turned slowly in a large radius and disappeared about 005° north of satellite Echo at an angle of 045° elevation. The course of the UFO was smooth with no accidents, power spurts, etc. The UFO was observed for a period of two minutes (0324 hours to 0325 hours) and appeared to be in the shape of a sphere about the size of a golf ball and when held at arms length, three triangular shaped lights, each about one tenth the size of the sphere, were seen which created an aurora in their direction. The remainder of the sphere was dark and the three lights, although yellow in nature, gave the sphere an overall effect of a dull orange color.

[Handwritten diagram showing first sighting, observation point, and disappearance direction]

It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the UFO was another satellite other than satellite Echo.
