11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a blinking blue light. The light was seen for 60 sec and was about as bright as a fourth magnitude star.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY                                                September 4, 1968

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of August 30, 1968, in which you stated that you and a friend had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO) the evening of August 29.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached form and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to check it further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,
(Signed)

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

BUDGET BUREAU APPROVAL
NUMBER 21-R328

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS. THIS WILL HELP AIR FORCE RESEARCH PERSONNEL IN EVALUATING THE CASE. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR NAME WILL NOT BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION.

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON?
DAY 29    MONTH 7    YEAR 68

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 8    MINUTES 35    [I.A.M. ✓][P.M.]

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR    MINUTES    [I.A.M.][P.M.]

4. TIME ZONE: [✓ CENTRAL] [EASTERN] [DAYLIGHT SAVING] [MOUNTAIN] [STANDARD] [PACIFIC] [OTHER]

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IN CITY    GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A HAND DRAWN MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS. IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY, WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

(Handwritten note: 11 mi)

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH, PLACE AN 'X' ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENON WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON. ON SKYLINE, WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A 'B' ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN.

(A diagram is included showing an angular measurement with an observer point and curved lines indicating height above horizon)

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THEN, SO THAT IT CAN BE CLEARLY SHOWN WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
