The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typewritten letter from the Department of the Air Force responding to a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting on August 29, 1968. The letter requests the person who reported the sighting to complete an attached form to provide additional information, and offers to further investigate the sighting if the information is provided.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
September 4, 1968
Dear [Redacted],
This will reply to your letter of August 29, 1968, in which you stated that you had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO) the evening of August 29.
Without additional information, our evaluation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached form and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our scientific people at WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO, will be able to check it further and make an evaluation.
It is also possible to the nearest Air Force Station. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.
In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the catalogues of objects reported as UFO's in the current scientific literature.
Sincerely,
(Signed)
JAMES H. AIRMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil-Military Branch
