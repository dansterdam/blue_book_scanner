PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE TIME GROUP
11-13 Mar 67

2. LOCATION
Tillamook, Ore.

3. SOURCE
Civilian/Military

10. CONCLUSION
#1. Astro (S/P)
#2. Radar (FALSE TARGETS)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One to Three

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched different lights four to five times larger than stars. The lights were red, white, and green and were blinking. The course varied from .10° to movement to north. Objects were seen on different occasions. Radar analysis indicated a typical false target, due to temperature inversions which were present on both the 12 and 13 March 67, was probably responsible for the radar patterns.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
Over one hour each Oc.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual
Ground-Electronic

7. COURSE
North

8. PHOTOS
[ ] Yes
[X] No

POSSIBLE SOURCES OF HELICOPTER TRAFFIC TO EXPLAIN LIGHTS (UFOs)

Investigating officers checked all Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and National Guard units in the area with negative results.

Not one had any helicopter activity in the area the evenings of the sitings. Checked possible private sources, i.e. Oregon Forrestry Service, private helicopter firms. Oregon Forrestry Service has no choppers and was unable to raise anyone at a private helicopter film servicing Shell Oil Co. off shore oil drilling rigs. This firm, located at Coos Bay, did not have any choppers in the area according to personnel at Tillamook County Airport.

SUBJECT: UFO Investigation Materials

TO: EWD (DETER)
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. The enclosed materials are results of an investigation conducted 15 March 1967 at Tillamook, Oregon on UFOs sighted 11 and 13 March 1967 in and around Tillamook, Oregon.

2. Results of the investigation are somewhat inconclusive. The 689th Radar Sq. tracked a metallic object, judging by strength of radar return, with quite unusual movement characteristics. The local civilians observed red/green/white lights which moved in a manner similar to flight of a helicopter or other hovering type aircraft. No units owning helicopters had any flight in that area those evenings. All sources but one, available to the investigators were checked out all with negative results. The definite track of the unknown by Mt. Hebo radar further complicates any correlation with known aircraft since at one point the track moved approximately 9 miles in one minute. From dead stop to dead stop, flirting an average velocity and acceleration the object would have to accelerate to 1200 mph and decelerate to 0 within one minute, a feat for known helicopter type a/c.

3. The enclosed tapes of eye witness reports were made on a AIMA (brand) battery operated portable tape recorder at 3 3/4 IPS, half track. Other material included should be self explanatory.

Memorandum for Record
Subject: UFO

1. The following reports on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) have been received from Mount Hebo Radar Station:

a. On Saturday, 11 March 1967, at approximately 2200 hours local, the [partially obscured] contacted or Mount Hebo received a call from the Sheriff's Office of [obscured] stating that a [obscured] sighted a UFO over Tillamook Bay. The [obscured] personnel at [obscured] called the Cannon Section. In the Operations Center, in response to the Deputy's queries, three airmen stated that they were tracking something on radar in this general area and other checking with [obscured] that they had also seen a small aircraft in the area. On [obscured], 12 March, Mount Hebo received a call from an alleged Associated Press man who stated that he had received a call from the Sheriff's Office that Mount Hebo was tracking a small aircraft in the vicinity and that a UFO had been sighted. In this case, Airman [obscured] had been in the vicinity and could not neither confirm nor deny the UFO. The UFO allegedly moved erratically and was not on radar for a minimum period of 40 minutes. As a result of the above sightings and calls, a media and PD announcement was made Sunday afternoon and evening that a "UFO" had been sighted in the Tillamook Bay area.

b. On Monday night, 13 March, at approximately 1900 hours, Mount Hebo received a call from Tillamook that a UFO had been sighted over Cape Meares. They checked out and found they did have a target on their radar. They called Division and Charles stated they had nothing in the area nor were showing anything in the area. Because Mount Hebo had a target they tracked it from initially at 39 miles from the station and bearing 027°. The target proceeded to approximately 6-7 miles from the station and then disappeared. When first noticed it was at 4,500 feet, it climbed to 5,700 feet with no comparable known movement, and was at 16,000 feet. When it disappeared, Mount Hebo had tracked the object from approximately 1915 until shortly before 0100 Tuesday morning. Shortly after takeoff, they received a bright report in the area of the object from Dyckman, but did not see anything.


- page 23 -

Malch if they had carried anything in the area, Malch searched and said they could see nothing. The weather was clear with the stars plainly visible. Mount Hebo asked Division to scramble a fighter to investigate the object, but Division did not do so.

2. I have directed ODC to review tapes and records for Saturday and Monday nights to determine what we were seeing, if anything, trying to correlate the UFO sighting with known or observed activities.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEER/V. D. Bryant/mjb/70401

SUBJECT: UFO Evaluation

TO: TDET/UFO(Maj Quintanilla)

20 April 1967

1. From the data available it is not possible to positively affirm or refute the presence of a material object at the point from which radar returns were received.

2. It is the opinion of this office, however, that the rapid speed changes, the hovering characteristics of the return, the association of the radar returns with red, green, and white lights observed visually, and the lack of known aircraft targets in the proper locations, all tend to indicate a typical "false" target (on the radar) due probably to temperature inversions which were present on both the 11th and 13th of March.

3. It is unfortunate that these observations are made over a period of hours on several successive nights without sending an interceptor up to investigate. The so-called target for the most part apparently was not moving at any excessive speed, and was at altitudes from 4800 to 9000 ft. If these people, including military personnel, are convinced that there is a "metallic" target up there, surely sending up a plane to investigate the radar returns (and probably the visual sightings as well) are not due to "metallic" targets but likely due to atmospheric disturbances, will not convince many people. If, on the other hand, an airplane is vectored up and runs right through the target without damage to the plane, and the pilot seeing nothing when he runs through it, (as has happened a number of times) it might convince some of the people.

4. In closing, if our analysis of this report is correct, it would appear that Dr. Condon and the University of Colorado Physics Department might provide a logical explanation of how these things happen.

Investigation at Mt. Nebo, 689th Radar Sq., 15 MARCH 1967

Col Reil, commander 689th Radar Sq., Mt. Nebo, Oregon told investigating officers that on Monday night, 13 March 1967, the radar operators at Nebo definitely picked up a "solid metallic" return target on the scopes that night around 11 p.m. The target came in from the north and disappeared to the north. Col. Reil further stated the target disappeared from the scopes at about 15,000 ft. altitude and a range of 55 to 60 NM from Nebo.
