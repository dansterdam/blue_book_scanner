10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Separate observations of objects on succeeding nights with same characteristics. Found blue flame with 10 ft tails of red flame. They appeared at about 45° elevation and maintained level flight. Flame just went out and nothing remained. Visible for few seconds each time. Both traveled in same direction. Sighting without visual aids by an all-night service station attendant.

11. COMMENTS
Description conforms to a meteor. Although red tail was present, there was no indication of breaking up and no satellite recoveries were reported for this date. Duration too short for reentry. Witness probably saw 2 meteors on succeeding nights. Appearance at the same location being attributed to coincidence. Herculids meteor shower occurs about Feb 20 and is a swift streak morning shower.
