11. COMMENTS
Description conforms to a meteor. Although real detail was absent, there was no indication of breaking up and no details were mentioned of sound or other details that would be expected for a near-strike even if distant. Probably was 2 meteors on succeeding flights. Appearance at the same location being attributed to coincidence. Possibly a series of related flights between Feb 20 and is a swift stream morning shower.
