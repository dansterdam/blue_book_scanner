On the day of December 22 we were having a small family gathering to celebrate Christmas. I had the same U. F.C. report from 1952 which my father always kept in his records. I wanted to show it to the family since it pertained to recent events in the area wherein a brilliant light was observed maneuvering over the neighborhood.

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top is a compass rose with directions labeled. The smaller sketches on the bottom show two landscape scenes, one with a person standing on a road and the other depicting a distant landscape.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACED "N" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "V" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "V" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE FIRST AND LAST SIGHTING. ALSO PLACE AN APPROXIMATE ESTIMATE OF THE ANGLE IT MOVED CLOCKWISE OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE FROM THE FIRST AND LAST SIGHTING.

OCR output:

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather various diagrams and illustrations. The first diagram shows a curved line representing the horizon, with instructions to imagine the observer's position and the position of an object in the sky. The second diagram is a compass rose, likely used to indicate the direction of the observed object. The third diagram shows the motion and path of a single object, with instructions to draw the motion. The fourth diagram shows multiple objects of different shapes, with instructions to draw how they were arranged and the direction they were traveling.

OCR text output:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show how high it was above the horizon when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document or report, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 Day January Month 1968 Year

Information which you feel pertinent, and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Our sighting was not during the daytime. It was around 6:15 p.m. on January 27, 1958. Our family was on the way to our evening meal. As we were driving along Highway 320 near Lansdale, PA, a bright object came into view. It seemed to be hanging motionless in the sky off to the left of our car. As we watched it, the object began to move slowly across the sky in a straight line. It moved without any sound and seemed to be high in the sky. The object was saucer-shaped and much brighter than any star or planet. It appeared to be about the size of a half-dollar held at arm's length. The object remained in sight for about 2 to 3 minutes. When it disappeared, it did so rather quickly, almost as if it had been turned off. The sighting caused quite a bit of excitement in the car, as none of us had ever seen anything like it before. Although we discussed it afterwards, we did not report it to any authorities at the time.

The image contains a photograph or diagram showing an observer's viewpoint and a curved line representing the observed phenomenon. The observer is instructed to indicate on the diagram how high above the horizon the phenomenon was when last seen.

"CASE IDENTIFICATION: CASE NO. F-1006-68 LOCATION: UPPER DARBY, PA. DATE: 1-6-68

SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REPORT:

DATE OF SIGHTING: 1-6-68 TIME: 8:15 PM EST DURATION: 3-4 MINUTES WITNESS: MRS. GERTRUDE M. WALLING, 7336 RADBOURNE RD., UPPER DARBY, PA. PHONE: LE 4-1883

DETAILS OF SIGHTING: MRS. WALLING STATED THAT SHE OBSERVED IN THE SKY TO THE NORTH, WHAT APPEARED TO BE 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS IN A HORIZONTAL CONFIGURATION. SHE WENT ON TO STATE THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT SHAPE OR SIZE OF THE OBJECT DUE TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LIGHTS. MRS. WALLING SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOTIONLESS AND WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-4 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. SHE ADDED THAT NEAR THE END OF THE SIGHTING THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BECOME DIMMER.

The recent case was a while ago and I don't recall many specific details about it. As I can see from the report, the witness observed bright lights in the sky that appeared to be in a horizontal configuration. The object was difficult to determine the exact shape or size of due to the brightness of the lights, but it seemed to be motionless and was observed for around 3-4 minutes before disappearing from view, with the object appearing to become dimmer near the end of the sighting."

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO-like object. The sketch shows an object with a saucer-shaped or disc-like structure.

According to the text below the image, the sketch was intended to represent the "angular size" of the object as observed by the witness. The text states that the angular size of the object was the same as the "length in front of a known object, such as a distant street light" as observed by the witness at the time of the sighting. The text also mentions that the witness was unable to perform a specific experiment related to the sighting at the time.

On the day of December third met for the first time the same U.F.O. It was almost evening from 4:12 
to 5:05 P.M. We saw it plain in the sky hovering over us and not unlike what I have seen be-
fore on TV. We were impressed and when we kept close watch on it, it seemed to disappear and 
reappear at intervals in slightly different positions. At times it seemed to be stationary and at
other times seemed to move a little at a time. We were greatly impressed and tried to tell
everyone we could about this strange phenomenon. This is the first time I have ever had an 
experience of this kind.
