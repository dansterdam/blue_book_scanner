27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The first time I have filled out a NICAP & have seen times before. I would like to first time I saw the object. of the object. I will enclose a picture of it which I will enclose along with the negative.

The last time since that I sighted a U.F.O. was on February 27, 1968. I saw three U.F.O.s before they started to whistle. and I was in my driveway at least 40 feet away from it.

It moved very fast once these shows up and could at least three times as quickly. The U.F.O. blinked at night. The lights on it slowed down. 

Nearly brightly, trees, down buildings so it could not be photographed. the entry reason I got the picture was because I was outside some time. like you were do begin with. I do not hesitate to contact
