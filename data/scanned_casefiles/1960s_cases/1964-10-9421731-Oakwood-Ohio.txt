(INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
1

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observation by amateur photographer. Object like a patch after the frame. 10 Pictures visible. 14th only. NE hwy. Two objects intersectis. Faster than 5-52's. Observed overhead in flight from 51 to NE. Sure observation made later in the evening. Observation of objects like shooting stars.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

WNe

COMMENTS: Possible meteor observations although the duration reported was excessive and NE data could be key. Also possible s/c with afterburn. Speed reported faster than 5-52 on beam width, in conflict with reported duration. Likely meteor sighting, but data insufficient for firm evaluation.

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
D. Yes
WNe
