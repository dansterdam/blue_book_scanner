27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.  

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Gentlemen,
Could you please send me some information on UFOs? Also, I think you would be interested in my story of a UFO.
In late August about 9:30 p.m., I was standing outside my aunts house (in Darlington, Pa.) and suddenly I finished putting on my shoe. I turned and saw what appeared to be the windows of a saucer about 25 feet in diameter and about 10 feet to the bottom. It whisped up and my camera snapped. I pulled out the film, but it made come Believe it and saw the camera for another second or two before it took off suddenly. 
I photographed this one.
If you request the photo, I will send you the original and a blowup of the saucer. This picture is, I think, good because you can see the windows of the craft.
Thank you for your consideration.
P.S. My address is: [redacted], KING OF PRUSSIA, PA. 19406

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document or report. As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

Please permit. The accompanying sources questionable, however, convicted a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies regarding the direction of flight of the unidentified object and the distance from the site to the object as revealed along with the fact that the photograph was taken through a window glass. Following examination of the photograph by the staff of FDPFF, it was determined that the photographic image is probably a reflection of an object superimposed in front of or behind the camera in the window glass. A more detailed identification of the actual object can not be made from the material and information available.

- page 17 -

The image contains a single Polaroid "Swinger" print and an FTD copy print. According to the analysis, the photograph showed the image of an unidentified flying object and it was determined to be an actual photographic image and not a blend in the film. The analysis indicates that the image is probably the reflection of an object in the window glass, as more precise identification of the actual object cannot be made from the material available.
