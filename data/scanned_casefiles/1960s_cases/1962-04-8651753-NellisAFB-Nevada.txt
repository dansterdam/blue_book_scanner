Hq USAF Public Information

Lowry Springs, Colorado

Dear Sir(s):

This letter is w/ reference to the sighting of a brilliant object (UO?) at or near The Nevada test site on April 18, 1962.

Your information, Lt. Col. Herbert Ralph, said that jets had been scrambled to intercept the object.

The official spokesman at Nellis AFB, in reply to the meteor explanation said, "There is only one thing wrong with that - a meteor cannot be tracked on radar and this thing was." I would like its official AF answer as to whether the object was a UFO. Furthermore, I would like a confirmation as to whether the object was destroyed with a nuclear weapon. Thanks and excuse for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

[Bottom of page is redacted/blacked out]

Dear Mr. [redacted]

The official records of the Air Force list the 13 April 1962 Nevada sighting to which you refer as "unidentified, insufficient data." There is an additional note to the effect that "the reported track is characteristic of that registered by a U-2 or a high balloon but there is insufficient data reported to fully support such an evaluation." The phenomena reported was not intercepted or fired upon.

Sincerely,

G. R. HART
