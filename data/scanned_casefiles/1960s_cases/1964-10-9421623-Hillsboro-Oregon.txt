Dear Sirs,

An unidentified flying object heading southeast from northwest was seen at 625 a.m. this day, October 1, 1964. My husband and I were on our way from our barn identifying various stars in the clear morning sky when we observed the flying object which appeared to be at an altitude of at cut 2,000 feet and at an angle of 50Â°. The speed appeared to be at least that of an F-106.
