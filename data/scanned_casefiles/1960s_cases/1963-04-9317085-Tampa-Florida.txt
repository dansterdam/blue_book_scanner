I wish that a professional observer could have the opportunity to see them before I point out the details. Saturday night, April 13, 1963, at approximately 8:45 PM, while driving west on Gandy Bridge, I observed a very bright star-like object in the sky. Like a fixed star in the sky.

From my point of view, I should like to have a trained scientific observer take a look. This will be for you.

                                    Very truly yours,
