UFO Observation, Fall, 1966

Bryan, Ohio 43506

1. This replies to your letter of November 17 on the subject of unidentified flying objects. We appreciated learning of your experience of last fall. At this late date it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation. If you will provide the exact date of your observation we will check the Air Force files to see if we received any other reports from your area on that date.

2. Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention.

Dear Sir

Bryan, Ohio is about 180 mi N.W. of Dayton, Ohio. I clipped these articles of the Tok & Bryan papers. I have read about all these is printed about flying saucers around. Last fall I got some good stories around Hamilton, Indiana about strange things on the RR track and I was said he saw 1 flying cover go down in the Rhine Wampler and I saw something that looked like a glowing light moving very fast in the nite sky. We were very excited for a while because it was not usual.

If you are interested in talking to some of these people I will give you my cooperation.

Sincerely yours

Officers Report Seeing
Unidentified Flying Object

Law enforcement officers from five different departments
kept their eyes skyward early this morning as they watched
an unidentified flying object that appeared in the area.
The Williams county sheriff's department was notified of
the object's presence at 4:28 this morning when officers of
the Indiana State Police told them they had spotted the
object in their state and were following it along Route 20
when it appeared to cross the state line.

Paul Shively, night desk man at the sheriff's department,
notified both the Montpelier and West Unity police depart-
ments and they continued the watch. Both Remi Vanhar-
ents of Montpelier and George Robinson of West Unity re-
ported seeing the object.

Both officers stated the object gave off a bright light and
appeared to be about the size of a basketball. They stated
it hovered overhead for between 25 minutes and three-quarters
of an hour and then moved in a southeasterly direction.
Robinson stated he notified his wife of the object and
she reported seeing it as late as 7:00 this morning and it
didn't disappear until daylight.

According to the county sheriff's radio log, officers of the
Fulton county sheriff's department and in Defiance county
also reported sightings. The Defiance officers stated that
the object appeared to be hovering over Kingsbury Park in
that city.

According to local authorities an attempt by officials at
the Toledo Express airport failed to detect the object's pres-
ence on radar.

UFO Is Reported
In Ohio, Indiana
Police Say Object
Tracked Many Hours

From The Black Correspondent

MONTPELIER, O.—Police agencies in two states observed an unidentified flying object for several hours early this morning as it traveled from Indiana into northwestern Ohio.

Several observers described it as "round, brighter than the moon," and as big as a basketball. It was still visible at 7:15 a.m. southeast of here, according to Remi VanHaeren, Montpelier police officer.

The Williams County sheriff's Department dispatcher was notified of the object by Indiana state patrolmen at 4:28 a.m. Indiana authorities reported that they had tracked it across the state.

The Williams and Fulton County departments along with private citizens observed the object. Local police from West Unity, Montpelier, and Stryker also saw it.

Observers said that the object moved up and down and back and forth. It was "quite bright" and moved in various arcs, and moved higher after dawn.

The object was not recorded on radar at Toledo Express Airport.

Gentlemen:

I write you long hand because I do not want anyone to know of this incident.

First fall, the day of the Syracuse University + Florida State football game, my two sons and I were driving north on Route #81 from my home in Tully. I was sitting in the front seat, my two sons in the front. We were talking about the game and about deer hunting. Conversation was somewhat animated. It was about 2:30 PM.

After awhile, when we were about at Nelson, I noticed some odd objects

seemed to me, directly over north
Syracuse. Having been an AAA officer
I idly speculated, almost such Con-
cludly, that they were AA bursts.
Suddenly I realized that they could
not be AA bursts. The objects were
large, smoke-grey, and moving
slowly in a sharp bend from
South back to North and in line.
They also were tilting East and West,
fairly plainly seen one way they were
the other way they became at most
invisible.

Space of time, I called out, "Look there! Look at that!" The boys naturally looked at the hillsides for deer, at the road for "Cars etc." They could not see that I was pointing. By this time they checked with me the road had bent, we were behind a hill mass and when the north was no longer obscured from view - we could just see the objects. Anyway, a modern car certainly limits view of the sky.

My two sons did not see the objects I specially described to them. The objects were somewhat the

shape of a derby hat. They were big my first thought perhaps 12,000 feet high in number and were not tilting in unison, although all were tilting at the rate of about one complete movement every five seconds. In shape I would say they must have been the size of a big-motor passenger plane. They were in my view perhaps 1½ to 2 minutes. Unfortunately, after I really saw what I was believing they were in sight perhaps fifteen to 20 seconds.

"It was no mirage. It was not swamp gas" I said. It was in no way anything I'm familiar with.

Naturally I kept quiet in the papers just accounts of other witnesses. There were none. This I do not understand.

I am not easily excited. I have been in a number of campaigns. I was at Pearl Harbor during the attack. Capital Division artillery advisor to the ROK on the front. 11th Division.

Perhaps there is a logical explanation this sighting but I fail to arrive at one in my own mind.

"April 7, 1966"

"On march 30, at 5:20 a.m. until 6:30 a.m. I watched what'd first thought was an unusual looking star hanging in the air next to a certain tree about 50 feet east of my home. I had been sound asleep and suddenly my eyes flipped wide open. I looked out of the window and took a good look at it. I looked at the clock and it was just 5:20. Then looked around at the sky for other stars, but there were none - it was just dawn. Then when I looked at it again, it was next to another tree nearly, so I knew it was moving, but it did not appear to be." These are the words of (Miss) J.E., who wrote this report to you. This story is very, very true - because during the year of 1966, I went out in my

star does or did appear at
night and in the morning when
call other stars could not be
seen. One night while I
was out, I happened to notice
it and decided to watch it. It
was queer the way it moved.
When I watched it, it never
moved then I turn around just
for a second or two and it's in a
different position! I have something
that I haven't told you! Quite a few
times. One night I was out in my
back yard, and there is a short of
medium sized tree in the neighbor's
yard. I looked over at it and saw an
eye, somewhat like a cat's eye glowing
at night. I moved from one side of
the yard to the other and the eye
moved too! I was going to go
see what it was, but I got scared.
Next morning I went to the tree and
found the limb where it was

was while ok watching me.

This next story is also true.
One might one of my friends,
about 11 years old was out playing
with other friends when he
ran around the corner and
something grabbed him and
started to run off with him.
He started to yell and just
before it dropped him and
disappeared he managed to
turn around and get a good look
at it. You probably won't believe
this but it had one eye, covered
with long hair, and had long
fingernails. (I am only 15 years
of age and with all the paper
clippings and paperback
books and UFOs, I am really
quite a good expert on UFOs

It would please me very much if somehow you would be able to contact Joan* Whitenour who is an UFO investigator, who investigated the Brooksville, Florida Case History of a Saucer Landing. It is very important to me that you contact her or at least try. I have quite a few questions to ask her about her investigation at Brooksville, Florida. She has a theory that there may be a base somewhere around and I am pretty sure from reading her notes and being a somewhat good ufo expert for my age, I dare that there is a base around the area. If you do contact her, tell her to look at this address so that I can send her my questions that are to be answered. (The book in which I read about her investigation is entitled "Flying Sauces Are Hostile".)

P.S. Please try and answer this letter as soon as possible, this is very important to me that you answer this letter. And with all I know so far about Brooksville, Florida, I say that there really is a saucer base there, you can investigate it too. There's a big hill which may be or - Probably is or are underground caves, filled with water. Sometimes there is a piercing high - pitched sound that comes from the hill as if they were drilling an underground base!

Proposed reply to letter from Mrs. [redacted] 12 March 1967

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

Reference your letter of 12 March 1967 concerning your unusual observation in September 1966. I appreciated your kind letter and definitely feel you must have observed something most unusual, however, I can not offer too much in the way of an explanation.

The only thing that comes to mind would be an artificial cloud release that occurred on 24 September 1966 from Wallops Island, Virginia. A rocket was launched at approximately 0413 EST. At altitudes of 310 and 570 statute miles, there were two enormous cloud releases. This was seen and reported as a UFO by individuals from as far west as Indiana. It did light up the eastern sky.

I am very doubtful that this was what you observed. This, of course, is only a shot in the dark. I was wondering if the sound and visual observation were unrelated. Another possibility is a static discharge, but this also is just a guess.

Your information will definitely be kept on file which adds to our data base. The late date would not permit a detailed investigation at this time. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Major H. Quintanilla, Jr.
D ayton, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla,

Today's Sunday paper gives your name as the person to report UFO sightings to. Altho' I have not experienced a sighting of an object, still I am a frightening phenomenon and heard a terrifying noise, one night in September of 1960. May I tell you of it?

I had been asleep in my bedroom alone in the house, as is usual. My bedroom window faces the east. At precisely 15 minutes to four, I was awakened by a loud noise. I can only describe it as a tremendous hum, a level, flat sort of buzzing. It lasted for seconds, then was followed by a light - not like an electric light but more like the high intensity tensor lights that are marketed now... that seemed to illuminate the entire eastern sky. This was through my window shade. I lay there, a bit frightened, more curious. In a matter of perhaps a minute, not more, it was followed by the same events - first the low, flat humming or buzzing sound, very loud and continuous, then the blinding blast of lights. I arose then, opened the shade, stood watching and listening. In the shade up all the way... my back yard is quite deep, has an alley behind it, and the neighbors' back yards about the alley, so there was no danger of my being seen in night clothes. In a matter of a few seconds, after I'd arisen, the hum came again in total darkness. At its completion the entire eastern sky, for as far as I could see in either direction, was illuminated with this intense light. It seemed to be in the distance nowhere near our town of Fairbault, perhaps as far away, if not further, as Rochester, a large city. I could have read by this light, so bright was it. It lasted for a few seconds, then abruptly turned off. That is the only way I can describe it. It didn't waver. I sat there for a few seconds, then was all. I went back to bed, noted the time... ten minutes to four in the morning, and phoned the police. When an officer answered, I asked, "What was that noise and light?" He said he hadn't heard it, which was to be expected since the police station is without windows that are not shaded by adjacent buildings and the walls muster for police is on all the time. Told him what I had seen and heard, and he would contact the power company. Then next morning, I was still disturbed about this, thought of several reasons for its happening and began to track each possibility down. I phoned our hospital, thinking that there had been more than one power failure, that the auxiliary powers had been turned on, and they had failed, too. I spoke to the night man himself, he said there had been no failure. Then, in turn, I phoned the Saint Mary's School for Girls, Saint Lucas Geriatric and Care Center, Shattuck Military Academy, Saint James School for Boys, Pleasant Manor Nursing Home... all of which are east of my home. No power failure had been experienced at any of these places. I phoned the police station again, was told the prowl cars had seen nothing, except some one doing drilling on a street about five blocks from my home, using a light for illumination. I explained that the light I had seen had suffused the entire sky in the east and was very brilliant.


- page 26 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

All could not possibly have been confused or mistaken for any other light I'd ever seen. I then phoned our radio station and the daily newspapers asking if anyone else had reported seeing and hearing what I had seen and heard. No one had. If I called our power plant, there had been no failures there.

I have a close friend, living on the east side, some distance from my home. She had seen and heard nothing. Her two little girls had meant to spend the night sleeping out doors, had been installed in their sleeping bags the family had settled down for the night. The little girls became frightened and wanted into their own beds, about the time my friend said by the time she and her husband got the girls in, along with their paraphernalia and had all gotten to sleep again, it must have been nearly three in the morning, and she had then slept, as she put it, "the sleep of the deaf" hearing nothing until the alarm ran off at seven in the morning.

I kept at this for several weeks, trying to find just one person who had seen and heard what I did. I wrote my son in Salt Lake City, Utah, at about the time I had phoned student there, working for his doctorate, a teaching assistantship. Finally, I became discouraged, since my inquiries became the source of jokes against me and dropped it. But I knew what I had seen, I knew what I had heard, we had had no storms or rains for several days, it was not thunder and lightning, it was as far from that noise and those lights as is possible to get.

Recently, I the 8th of us give it another try. I really bugged me I I phoned the police station to get the exact date. Then it was September, sometime after he left the middle of September, driving back to school, and I had written him all about it. I know that a record is made of every call to the police station and believed it would be a simple matter to get the exact date. But then I got the runaround. I would call at one time of the day to get a man who was willing to help but who could find nothing. Since my call was not a "complaint", should have been listed as a report, but it wasn't. I would then get a man who openly scoffed at the whole thing. The man on duty, who was located, remembered my calling in, tried to find the record of the call, could not. After were really interested but could not or were not give me (put in allowed back there my date. So I quit.

I did not see any object at all in the skies. I didn't see any flashing lights at all, and there were no colors at all. There was this blinding illumination of the entire eastern sky for a matter of seconds. There were only the three double events... the flat, level hum or buzz...like a million planes flying in the distance...followed by the blinding, brilliant lights. These three events happened within a period of five minutes at the most. I know I phoned the police station at exactly, precisely ten minutes to four in the morning, and that it was in September, I think sometime after the 17th of that month. I was not dreaming. I was on my feet, at my window with the dark up-welling, the. We'll, we'll, we'll, and saw the other two and heard the other two hums ( for want of a better word ) through the shade. I do not drink. I am a level, hard-headed woman...have had to be since I have been alone with the responsibility of raising two sons alone. I am not a youngster, seeking thrills or attention because of this. But, darn it, I'd sure like to know about it!

"I don't think I'd get anywhere, reporting this to our local, county or state police. I think if I were to report it to the nearest Air Force base, their investigations would be hampered as mine was, with the local police. This is not to say they have not been courteous, only that they will not give me the date of my call, and without that, who can do anything? I didn't make a note of it, thinking that I could find out about it myself the following days. But since information is asked for in this paper today, I'm sending mine on. For what it is worth. I hope you can make something of it.

Very sincerely,"

APR 21 1967

Dear Mrs.
Major Quintanilla has asked that I reply to your letter concerning your unusual observation in September 1966.

Your kind letter is appreciated and I definitely feel you must have observed something most unusual, however, I can not offer much in the way of an explanation. The only thing that comes to mind would be an artificial cloud release that occurred on September 24, 1966 from Wallops Island, Virginia. A rocket was launched at approximately 4:13 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. At altitude of 340 and 570 nautical miles, there were two enormous cloud releases. This was seen and reported as an unidentified flying object by individuals as far west as Indiana. It did light up the eastern sky; however, I am doubtful that this was what you observed. Just also a possibility is a static discharge, but this also is just a guess.

Your information will be kept on file which adds to our data base. The late date would not permit a detailed investigation at this time. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted]

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent completed FTD Form 164 describing your observation of an alleged unidentified flying object.

A study of the submitted information did not reveal a positive identification. The only explanation that I can offer is that an aircraft was observed; this, of course, being only a possibility.

There is a high speed, low level aircraft training route slightly west of Cairo, Ohio. Aircraft operating on the route fly toward the southwest. Since aircraft records are normally destroyed after 30 days, it would be impossible to check the records at this time for any aircraft activity on the days of your sighting. It is extremely important for one to report his observation as soon as possible so that a meaningful investigation can be made.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Sir:

I just got your address and I thought I'd send you some information on the object I saw. You may not think what I saw was a UFO or flying saucer, but I can tell you what I saw can be an object of earthly make.

Here's the description as near as I can explain it.

Sep. 10/66   8:30 - 9:00 Approx.   Path
me and my brother were                   white   blue   red

We sighted an object going East to West at a distance. At first was going in a column wave with an object similar I thought was a star. But when it collided with the object turned red(?) it came out as a SW direction. It kept getting closer. Till at looks at like it was 1/5 of a mile away, going large, made no sound, then it changed(?) to a blue white, stood a few seconds then changed course, white.

(Signed 1104)

Here is the OCR text from the document:

-then came back- life it returned
of site and it was time writing again
some 5 miles after this we didn't see it again
the closest it came was from 4 miles
to 5 mile approximate, height was 500 ft
1500 feet pre-more, light in our house fluttered.
When it came two and it was bright. Then
the final magnitude line steady grew, but
changing color.
I've might have seen something
of an earthly nature, so I'm going
to sit you decide. I would be very grateful
for a reply and if in any way I can
help you, let me know because I've
done this of research and I work in my
spare time with astronomy and
work with metros

Thank you for
taking time out to read this.
Your friend,

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and not how
much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the
sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?   The whole of it. The
match is about the same size of the object at its closest approach.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details
of the object you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.

Operation Blue Book

Dear Sir,

On the evening of 12th September 1966 I was passing over Beacon Street in Lowell Mass. Beacon Street is the highest point in the city. As I saw for miles, as I approached the playground area between Methuen an 18th Street I noticed a tie up in traffic. I slowed up to see what it was all about. Off to the left was a undesirable glow high in the sky. As I watched the object I became mystified. This object was in the North West, it was many times as big as the largest star, it was also much brighter. The main reason I am letting you know about this is because it was still light approximately 6:45 PM. This object did not move but seemed to have some kind of a motion - the outer portion - I can not clearly define it. Earlier in the day a report from W.B.Z in Boston made mention of a UFO being spotted in New Hampshire by a state trooper on a few other people. This object I am talking about could have

been in the same vicinity.

I may not be able to define this object clearly but I can tell you for sure it was not an aircraft or a natural phenomena. I am wondering if you get a report from anyone else, there were quite a few people looking or should I say staring at this object. I hesitated writing this letter because of the many weird reports you must receive but the more I dwell at it over the more I dwell to write.

Stamford, Connecticut 06903

Sept. 10, 1966

Gentlemen:

While taking some pictures from the surface of the ocean (and slightly below) into a sunset I have some pictures that look quite like all those I have seen of flying saucers. (I do not believe they are flying saucers - but rather a form of light refraction.)

However I set here you have some investigative committee that looks into such reports and I'd be glad to forward them on if any one is interested in seeing them.

I'm unsure where to send either this letter - or a photographic one. Thank you for any information you can give me.

Yours truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]

Dear Mrs [redacted]:

Reference your letter of September 10, 1966 in which you stated that you had photographs taken from the surface of the ocean into a sunset.

A photographic analysis of your color transparencies revealed the following: The photography provided indicates central refraction with an undetermined number of secondary refractions or reflections of the iris diaphragm in and on the optical system. The circles within the hexagon shapes are defraction patterns. This is a perfect textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

I have inclosed your negatives and four enlargements. We wish to thank you for mailing the Air Force to review the photographs.

Sincerely,
