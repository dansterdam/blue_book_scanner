"...and I was walking home from a trading ally some distance from home. We were on moved out when I decided to stop for a rest. We noticed a bright star in the distance. A few seconds later we noticed that the object which we thought was a star was moving toward us very slowly. We thought it was just an ordinary plane until we could see its diamond shape. There were four red lights and two strong white lights on the bottom, a slight cloudlike appearance on top."

[Continued handwritten text]:
"The object moved over our heads and appeared to grow against slightly. At first we heard no sound, it moved off into distance rather and we could..."

Hear a very low hum, like that of an electric generator. The sound was steady and unbroken, it kept the same low pitch. After the object went out of sight we discussed the matter and decided to report it.

March 20, 1962

Dear Sir:

Of on the behalf of my two friends & myself, 
am writing this letter to report what we believe 
to be an un-identified flying object.

This object was sighted over the city 
of La Puente, California at about 12 PM on 
the evening of Feb. 16th 1962.

The object was at first thought 
to be a star, but after we had proceeded to watch 
it, we heard a low hum, quite loud in tone. 
When we heard this hum, we observed 
that this object was approaching our position 
at a slow, steady pace. When the object 
drew closer, we saw it was not one light, 
but an object roughly the shape of a diamond 
with lights in different positions. These 
lights were steady, and were blended 
while we were watching it. As the object 
moved, the sound from this object was so 
slight that it was not noticeable to one 
not listening for it. At the height we were

Sgt. Lowell down sketches in later script
of letter.

The object passed directly over our
position, heading toward the San Bernardino
Hills.

We estimated the object's altitude
50 to 75 mph. The altitude at 3 to 5 hundred feet.
From the time we first sighted the object until
it passed from sight, about 1/2 minute. The
heading was judged to be roughly N.E.

The shape was not very distinct,
but we discerned that the shape was that of
a diamond. The lights were

DATE: April 4th 1962

[Partial text of narrative, some words are difficult to read clearly]:

"My two companions and I were walking along [illegible] when stopped to rest, while sitting on the curb, we noticed that we thought to be a very bright star. We sat looking at it for about 5 m(2) minutes. At this time the object was seen to move(while on the curb, we watched the object through the branches of a group of trees across the street). Its motion noticed as in relation to trees/trees).

At first thought the object was an aircraft of some kind, but noticed that it just was moving very slow. The object moved toward us. It was then that we heard the sound from the object. The sound from the object was at no time very loud. The sound was low in tone, being like sound of an electrical transformer. There was no detectable oscillating in this tone.

When the object came closer, we noticed that it was not a solid light as the first thought. The lighting was composed of separate red, and white lights. As the object came overhead, could see [some words illegible]..."

From it was directly overhead seemed to see a rough outline of the
object. (5 to clock, 82)

The object passed overhead I then headed towards the San Gabriel Mts.
on a course of NNW-NW. (This is an estimation.) The object seemed to gain
altitude on a shallow angle and passed from sight.

The total time elapsed was about five(5) minutes and thirty(30)
seconds.

The time of the sighting was between 11:15 and 12:15,
on the evening of March 21, 1962.

This report is as near as I can write it, I hope it will help.
