11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:

Observer watched a star shaped object that had four lights in a diamond shape-two white on the ends and two red. Two FAA Centers and CAA were contacted. No sonic was heard when the object moved away during the second sighting. There was a brief sound hovering above a group of trees and a house. Erratic maneuvering then occurred. Object was hovering when first sighted and after three minutes it moved toward the S.W.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. Any aircraft in the area under VFR would not have been known to the FAA.

OF THIS SIGHTING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT RECEIVED IN WHICH THE
DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT IS SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE SO-
CALLED "FLYING SAUCERS." THE DEPARTURE OF THE OBJECT FIRST TO THE
WEST AND LATER TO SOUTHWEST SUGGESTS A HELICOPTER SINCE THESE DEPARTURES ARE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MEMPHIS METROPOLITAN AIRPORT.
HOWEVER, AN EXAMINATION OF A MAP OF THE MEMPHIS AREA DOES NOT SHOW
ANY REASON WHY A HELICOPTER SUCH AS MIGHT BE USED IN PASSENGER
SHUTTLE SERVICE WOULD BE FLYING NEAR THE POINT OF SIGHTING AT SUCH
A LATE HOUR. OBSERVER DISPLAYED A REASONABLE SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE

WITH MODERN AIRCRAFT TYPES BY DESCRIBING THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT
AS BEING LIKE A PHANTOM II DURING A MAX IMUM PERFORMANCE TAKE OFF.
THIS SUGGESTS A HIGH RATE OF CLIMB AND GREAT SPEED FOR THE OBJECT.
BUT OBSERVER STATED THAT OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A CONSTANT ALTITUDE.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE OBSERVER WOULD HAVE READILY RECOGNIZED A
HELICOPTER AS SUCH BY ITS NOISE, SILHOUETTE OR MANEUVERS. THE
PARTICULAR SOUND ATTRIBUTED TO THE OBJECT AND THE MYSTERY OF THE
RADIO NOISE REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT.

THE MEMPHIS FLYING SERVICE ALSO IS LOCATED NEAR THE POINT OF SIGHT-
ING BUT INFORMATION ON THE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT IN USE OR SCHEDULES
IF ANY, ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE AVAILABLE
INFORMATION DOES NOT LEAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING. PARA WL: NONE.

December 5, 1966

Colonel Louis DeGoes
Director of Technology and Subsystems
Headquarters Foreign Technology
Division (AFSG)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel DeGoes:

This is in reply to your request of November 21, 1966, for information concerning helicopters or a similar type of aircraft operating in the Memphis area at approximately 0540 GMT, November 3, 1966.

A search of all available records at this facility does not reveal any helicopter operations in progress at that time. This does not necessarily mean there were no helicopters in the area since they could have been operating VFR and not under the control of the Memphis Tower.

Inquiries made of the Memphis Naval Air Station resulted in the information that they had no record of any helicopter operations at that time.

Sincerely yours,

James F. Arthur
Chiefs, Memphis Tower
