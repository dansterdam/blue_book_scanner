The text of the document is as follows:

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING OF 14 September 1967
Mrs. ___ called regarding her observation of an unidentified flying object. She had observed a similar thing about two months ago. She was attracted by a very bright light, it was a very clear night, very definite white light with some red and blue and when she got the telescope there was a clear outline that would have been triangular in shape, but last night it was circular in shape.
The observation took place last night, 14 Sep 67, at 1130 pm. 
The object was at a distance. It looked like a very bright light. This is the only light Mrs. ___ saw, a constant very bright white light and a slight movement changing red and blue in color. At first Mrs. ___ thought it was an airplane but when she kept watching it for an over an hour she knew it couldn't be, moved slightly eastward with no apparent change in the altitude. First observed the object in the North then moved slowly northeast. Mrs. ___ didn't think it was a star because there wasn't anything there in the sky at other times. Object didn't appear to go up or down. Since additional information was necessary we asked Mrs. ___ if she would complete a form on her sighting. She said that she would be glad to do so. Her address is:
Dayton, Ohio
