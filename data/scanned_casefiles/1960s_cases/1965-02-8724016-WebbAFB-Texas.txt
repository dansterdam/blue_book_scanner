ATTN OF: AB-PLANS                                                                   4 March 1965

SUBJECT: UFO Investigation

TO:     AFSC (TWD)
         Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. In accordance with paragraph 13b, AFR 200-2 and based on a UFO report submitted by Captain Brown and Lt Marsden (Attachment 1) the following data and information is forwarded.

    a. Captain Brown is a T-38 Instructor Pilot, age 28, and holds a B.A. Degree. His occupation involves both observation and technical knowledge. Further, Captain Brown has 2,200 hours of flying time; 1,500 hours of which was flown in the Webb AFB Area.

    b. Lt Marsden is a student pilot, age 24, and holds a B.B.A. Degree. Observation and technical knowledge are involved in his training. Lt Marsden has over 200 hours of flying time and all 200 hours were flown at Webb AFB, Texas.

2. The basic description of the object given by the two officers was a bright blinking white light, round in shape. This object was approximately the size of a dime held at arms length. Only one object was reported by the observers; therefore, no formation was noted. There were no other pertinent features described by Lt Marsden and Captain Brown in their report.

3. The object was first noticed by Lt Marsden who immediately called Captain Brown's attention to it. Both pilots agree on the location and course of the object which is as follows:

    a. The object was seen at 11 o'clock (relative position) and at an angle of 10° elevation relative to the position of the aircraft which was approximately 42 NM southeast of Webb AFB. The object was on an east to west course near north of Webb.

    b. When the light was first noted, it was stationary and a blinking mass seen. However, when the pilots first moved closer in order to investigate, the object accelerated off in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed. The light diminished as the plane turned toward it and was out of sight in 3 to 4 seconds.

    c. The total length of time that the light was visible was not more than three minutes.

4. The manner of observation was air-visual. Both observers were in
a T-38 aircraft (Serial No. 610818) at an altitude of 22,500 feet.
The heading was northerly from San Angelo (TOM southeast of Big Spring).
The speed of the aircraft at the time of the sighting was .8 mach and
during pursuit of the object, speed increased to .95 mach.

5. The date and time of the sighting was 0120Z, 25 February 1965 and
the lighting condition at this time was described as night.

6. The following is personal data on the observers.

a. Captain Brown, Wilber
59639A
3561st Pilot Training Squadron
3561st Pilot Training Wing

b. 2/Lt Marsden, John R.
A03L308H
3561st Student Squadron
3561st Pilot Training Wing

c. Both pilots are considered to be reliable.

7. Both pilots reported the sky was hazy up to about 14,000 feet;
above 15,000 feet the sky was clear and visibility unlimited. At
22,500 feet the observers visibility was unimpaired (i.e. no thunder
storms, unlimited ceiling, etc.)

a. The weather bureau's report of weather at the time was clear,
with upper wind information as follows:

6,000           340°    30K
10,000          330°    10K
16,000          310°    55K
20,000          300°    50K
30,000          290°    65K
50,000          270°    75K

8. Checking possible sources and/or causes of the reported phenomena
failed to identify it as emanating from known aircraft traffic.

a. The local civilian authorities were contacted, but there was
no reported aircraft traffic in the area of the sighting at 0120Z,
25 February 1965.

b. The TTX Test Center at Fort Worth reported there were no tests
or unusual aircraft flying at the time of the sighting.

c. An interview was held with the Chief Observer at the Sweet-water Air Force Station but he had neither heard of the reported object nor had any such object been seen on the radar equipment. This Air Force Station contacted other neighboring GCI units and it's headquarters in Oklahoma City. There was no unusual activity logged by any of these organizations.

d. Civil and federal weather stations throughout the area reported there were no weather balloons aloft at the time of the sighting.

9. No explanation can be given concerning this UFO on the basis of information received during the course of the investigation.

10. Attachment 1 is the report submitted by the two observers.

STATEMENT

On the night of 24 February 1965, Captain Brown and myself took off on a night transition mission from Webb AFB, Big Spring, Texas in a T-33 basic trainer, at 1900 hours. We climbed to 22,500 feet and proceeded to San Angelo, Texas, then turned north to Colorado City, Texas. Our position relative to Webb AFB was approximately 42 NM southeast. At approximately 1920 hours at an altitude of 22,500 feet, travelling at approximately .8 Mach, I sighted a round, white light at the 11 O'clock position at an angle of approximately 10 degrees elevation. The object radiated a white light of high intensity and appeared to be about the size of a dime. It was travelling on an east-to-west course and appeared north of Webb AFB. I called the light to Captain Brown's attention and as we watched it, it blinked on and off approximately 3 times. Each time it blinked off, the light was out for approximately 4 or 5 seconds and at that time no object could be seen in that position. We turned our aircraft and headed toward it accelerating to approximately .95 Mach.

The position of the object in relation to us remained constant for 1 or 2 seconds. Then the object accelerated off at a very high rate of speed on a north-westerly direction. It gradually diminished in intensity and was completely out of sight in approximately 3 or 4 seconds. No discernible features could be observed of objects other than the intense white light. Total time of observation from first sighting until it disappeared was approximately 3 minutes.

just east of the Texaco VOR at the reported time of sighting.

2. A B-52 from Walker AFB was returning from a simulated bomb drop on Dallas
Texas. This drop was made at 01002. The return would place the A/C 45 mi NW of
Big Springs at 01022. This B-52 was WESTBOUND and landed at Walker at C2402.

B-52 was in position of the observation from the T-38 a/c piloted by Capt Brown
and 2Lt Marsden of Webb AFB.
