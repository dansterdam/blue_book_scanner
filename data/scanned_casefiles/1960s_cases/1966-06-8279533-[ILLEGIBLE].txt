For the record:                                                     29 Jan 57

Contact was made with the witness [REDACTED] observer reported seeing an object with blinking red lights come up the trail. The trail was about 15 feet in width. The object hovered above the trail and moved from side to side and was there for about 20 minutes before settling to the ground. It was about 3 or 4 blocks away from the observers. A nearby highway was used. Three red lights were seen at first but later began to glow. After the object appeared the area in question was six other objects which had come from adjacent mountains.

Although the sun was "shining to rise" the witness still could not see the object well enough to make any definite features. The seven objects returned toward the west for about 15 minutes then formed into a straight line and went behind a mountain.

The observer could not give any other details about the time they above the object was still in the same place. The three holes were in a mound of dirt along side of the trail. The ground underneath was a tight light brown and the marks in the dirt were not below the ground underneath.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to set out the sighting of several unidentified flying objects. On June 19, my courtmartial at six o'clock in the morning near a mountain near Shelby, N.C. tracking on a mountain near a courthouse so that possibly my out. They did not return o'clock nine o'clock the next morning. at twelve about the mountain saw three red pulsating lights in the shape of a triangle. They appeared to be coming toward us, covering above the trail. The lights stopped moving at the top of a small rise. Two and yards apart, has two red lights on the sides continuously, clicked or had one that formed was top of the triangle, center light, or to one that formed was top of the triangle. The collect rose above the big rock and the object suddenly rose above the trees. It moved across the sky in a very smooth and fast manner. At its lowest point it was about 50 to 100 feet above the trees.

A total of six objects, hovering principles, one which was side of the river colors. They then a straight line and took off at great speed. The next portion was about a mile and a half from the first sighting. Lasted a mountain. Later about sixty fast from, a few some trees in row. The object was in the road, trees were three holes is two form of an oscillatorial triangle. A second working five minutes apart. These were about three times less near and about in land site. The our observer reported, a great deal more and the sighting was over.

I am part of Troop 43 of Charlotte, N.C. and are sponsored by some other organization.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report the sighting of several unidentified
flying objects. On June 11, my cousin and I, along with
including myself went back-packing on a mountain tour.
Our trail was near that ninth hill road in the boys
scout area. My scoutmaster took that down the mountain to a
scout camp. That evening about twelve midnight, may did not return
until about nine o'clock the next morning. At about twelve
o'clock that night, the four of us who were left on the
mountain saw three red glowing lights in a shape of a
triangle. They appeared to be coming toward us, overhead
above the trail. The lights stopped moving at the same point
to be approximately two hundred yards from camp. The two
red lights on the side continued, slowed on and off
about every five seconds. The center light, of 3.5 miles
forward, was the brightest. The color was very white and
rapidly. Ever fifth time, it turned white. The object
remained over its fixed point for about five to seven
o'clock in the sun across and the object definitely
was above the trees. It hovered very low over a nearby
ridge. The two side lights were approximately 100 yards
(7 or 8 acres). It looked like a UFO still. Though my
cousin was the most skeptic of camp, he was now convinced.
I found this circle around the silver object. The next found
a small white area about 50 yards in diameter. We were still
bent that the object was white. They discovered
a circle approximately 50 yards in diameter. They were not
to investigate. Their story that they saw, a few more
items that were unusual and peculiar in the
ground, there were some holes in the form of an oscillatorial
circle. These were approximately five to seven acres near
any water stream. They found about 50 yards at high site. We
our scoutmaster returned, we asked the area to hike and the
chief of camp, a aerial that something had to have gone
there.

We are west of Troop 49 of Charlotte, N. C. and are
spending our days still wondering what happened.

Sincerely,

[Signature area blacked out]
