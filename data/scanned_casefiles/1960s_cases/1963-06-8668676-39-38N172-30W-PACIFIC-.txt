Here is the text from the document:

[PAGE 38, 1963]

SATELLITE 1960 IOTA 1
FOR GIVEN LATITUDES

[The document appears to be a detailed table with multiple columns showing satellite tracking data, including time, longitude, latitude, and other numerical measurements. The data is organized by date (June 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, and 29, 1963) and seems to be related to satellite observations.

At the top of the page, there are some header calculations and notations, but they are partially obscured and difficult to read completely.]

The document is a dense technical table with rows of numerical data, primarily focused on satellite tracking information for specific dates in June 1963.
