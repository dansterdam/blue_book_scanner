The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns showing satellite tracking information. The table is titled "SATELLITE TRAK LOG" and contains columns for date, time, and various coordinate and measurement values. The data seems to be for multiple dates in March 1963, with locations around 36N 174-02W in the Pacific. The bottom of the page contains some additional text that is partially illegible, but appears to be notes or explanations related to the satellite tracking data.

The specific columns include:
- Date
- Time
- Various coordinate measurements
- Longitude
- Latitude
- Other numeric values

The data is repeated for different dates in March 1963, with multiple rows of measurements for each date.
