UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

Near midnight, August 13, 1960, Red Bluffs (Cal) police officers Charles A. Carson and Stanley Scott saw a "glowing, oblong object" with red and white side lights low in the eastern sky directly ahead. Among its characteristics: silent hovering, rapid and acute directional changes incapable of execution by known aircraft.

The officers, keeping a watch which lasted more than two hours, radioed a local Air Force radar station and got a swift, startled reply — "unidentified." Carson and Scott, quickly regaining the calm powers of observation expected of law enforcement officers, watched the object—occasionally beaming its lights to the ground—until it vanished below the eastern horizon.

On August 13 at Corning, California where police officers chased a red-lighted UFO for 2 hours the following was reported. Twice the unknown machine approached the police car, one of its red lights sweeping the ground like a searchlight. One policeman angled their red spotlight upward, and the descending UFO swerved away. Throughout the encounter, a static-like roar drowned the police radio. In the meantime radar screens at the nearby Air Force Base at Red Bluff, California reported a good "hard return" of the unknown on their screens, which indicated a solid object in the vicinity.

NEAR-LANDING IN FRANCE: One of the closest sightings in a long time occurred last August 5th between the towns of Moulle and Lille in France.

A man named Daniel Thot and his wife were driving home from a visit with relatives. When a very strange road object was blocked the highway in front of them. It was the "color of the setting sun" and was only a few feet across. The UFO was moved to one side of the highway and let the car pass, but it continued to follow Thot and his frightened wife. The object was about 15 feet high and 10 feet wide, and brightly lighted on the bottom, where the upper part was dark and somewhat transparent. Thot claimed he saw a human form within the strange machine, but he was able to give no details. - The incident occurred late at night, and there were no other witnesses.

No Case (Information Only)                                11 August 1960
                                                                   Boulder, Colorado

On August 11, 1960 at Boulder, Colorado Driver Ray Hawks reported the stalling of his tractor engine by a large UFO, which hovered about 500 feet off the ground. He said that his engine re-started after the UFO shot up, surrounded by "heat waves." A "thrumming sound" was heard and a steady blinking of lights was seen by Hawks in his close encounter. There were also several indications of attempted or actual "touch" landings.

CLOSE SIGHTING IN A COLORADO CANYON: On August 12th • Boulder, Colorado truck driver named Ray Hawks reported a strange experience he had had "a few previous at Thornton." While operating a tractor along in a canyon a few miles from Boulder, he heard what sounded like an explosion in the air. A UFO then dropped out of a cloud to a point about 400 or 500 feet from the ground, and 600 yards away from him. It hovered in one place for 15 minutes. Hawks said the craft was 45 to 50 feet in diameter and 10 to 15 feet thick. It had no markings. There was a sort of velvety appearance to it, with a silver sheen yet it did not shine like a normal metal. About two feet from the outer edge were five observable metal plates, one of which was sending out bluish smoke of some kind. There was an all-pervading noise, like the thrumming of a generator out of phase. While the craft was hovering nearby, the tractor and other electrical equipment on the tractor would not work. After the UFO finally rose and disappeared into the clouds, the tractor again operated as usual.

AUG. 11, 1960 LEFT HAND CANYON, COLORADO (LORENZEN # 241)

RAY HAWKS OF BOULDER WAS WORKING A FARM TRACTOR IN SECLUDED LEFT HAND CANYON, WEST OF BOULDER, HEARING A MUFFLED EXPLOSION WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM ABOVE. HE LOOKED UP SHORTLY AND A ROUND OBJECT DROPPED VERTICALLY THROUGH A CLOUD, STOPPING ABOUT 650 FEET AWAY AND SOME 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THEN OBJECT WOBBLED A LITTLE AS IT STOPPED, AS A COIN WOBBLES WHEN THROWN UPON A TABLE. HAWKS NOTED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED AS TWO CONCAVE DISCS JOINED TOGETHER AND ABOUT ONE-FIFTH AS DEEP AS ITS DIAMETER. THE DISC WAS NOT SHINY,

RATHER IT HAD A DULL-GRAY COLOR, AROUND ITS PERIMETER AND A LITTLE INSIDE. FROM THE EDGE WERE A SERIES OF SHINY METAL PLATES, WITH A SMALL GAP BETWEEN EACH, WHICH COULD BE SEEN ON THE UNDERSURFACE AS IT DESCENDED AND ON THE UPPER EDGE AS IT CAME TO REST IN THE AIR.

HAWKS BECAME AWARE OF AN INTERMITTENT HUM SIMILAR TO AN ELECTRIC MOTOR OUT OF PHASE AND IDLING, WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE DISC. ONE OF THE PLATES WAS OOZING A ROYAL BLUE SMOKE, THEN TO HAWKS'S AMAZEMENT HE OBSERVED THAT THE PLATE GIVING OFF SMOKE BEGAN TO RECEDE INTO THE OBJECT.

*JUST LIKE YOU MIGHT TILT THE WINDSHIELD OF AN AUTOMOBILE PRIOR TO TAKING IT INSIDE THE CAR*, THEN AN ELONGATED HOLE COULD BE SEEN IN PLACE OF THE PLATE.

NEXT HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A NEW PLATE WITH WHAT WAS WORKED INTO PLACE FROM WITHIN AND HE DISTINCTLY HEARD A CLICK AT THE END OF THE OPERATION. THE INTERMITTENT HUM INCREASED IN INTENSITY, UNTIL IT INCREASED A WHOLE OCTAVE* AND ATTAINED A VERY HIGH PITCH. AT THIS STAGE THE DISC APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A SORT OF SHIMMERING FIELD WHICH RESEMBLED HEAT WAVES. THEN THE DISC SUDDENLY TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT VERY HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

WHEN HAWKS FIRST SIGHTED THE UFO, HE WAS WORKING THE SHOVEL LOADER ON HIS TRACTOR. AS THE DISC CAME CLOSER THE ENGINE STOPPED. HE THOUGHT HE HAD CONTINUED THE LIFTING OPERATION AFTER IT WAS FULLY ELEVATED, WHICH WOULD HAVE KILLED THE ENGINE. HE REACHED DOWN TO RESTART HIS ENGINE, BUT THE STARTER WAS DEAD. HAWKS SAID HE WASN'T FRIGHTENED AND THAT THE DISC TOOK ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE WHOLE OPERATION.

Dear Sir:

I am writing again in regard to the UFO residuals which have been discussed in previous correspondence (see my letter dated 9 March 1960 which you answered 14 March 1960).

We have delayed sending this material to A. T. G. C. for several reasons. We feel for the thing that Air Force analysis should have an opportunity to study the complete history of the material before attempting tests of their own.

A complete report of this type has been prepared for some time but we have encountered problems in getting it published. These problems appear at present to have been resolved and copies will be forwarded to your office and to A.T.G.C. as soon as possible.

For reasons not entirely clear, you have chosen to withhold comment on our suggestion that the proposed tests be performed by an independent party, such as the Army, under the cognizance of USAF and ATIC forces.

During the course of this protraction of this procedure, certain matters have increasingly become more complex. The public confidence which frankly speaking is shared by APRO, has been recommended would diminish any basis for possible conflict of test results by demonstrating the good faith of all parties concerned.

I would also like to inquire whether or not the Air Force has reached any official conclusions concerning the following listed cases and, if so, what these conclusions are:

(1) The case at Red Bluff, California, August 13, 1960, involving Sgte. and Patrolman and (simultaneous viewing from two locations provided range and altitude data).

(2) The incident near Boulder, Colorado (in Left Hand Canyon) on 11 August 1960 involving Ray Hawkes. He stated "heard" "strange" "weird" reactions symptomatic of Gamma radiation.

(3) The case at Wyoming involving five employees of the San Juan County Road Department who, on July 1, 1960, were on a slag dump.

Sincerely yours,

1. Reference attached copy of a letter to Department of the Air Force from [redacted] dated 17 October 1960.

2. The Red Bluff, California sighting was probably due to the refraction of common objects. Weather data reveals that temperatures were inversions throughout the general area during the period of the sightings. While the actual object responsible for each sighting cannot be determined, it is highly probable that the UFO seen by the highway patrol officers was the planet Mars.

The sighting was relayed to Edward Malbach, director of the Milwaukee Astronomical Observatory, who with his comment, "The UFO was described as a ball of white light encircled by the middle rings. It moved rapidly from west to east, then hovered. Then at a 75-degree angle, and then moved with a north such far as a jet. Air was in sight for a half hour.

Satellite Relays
2-Way Phone Call
'We're Reading You Loud and Clear,'
Californian Says in Historic Hookup

HOLDMEL, N.J., Aug. 13 (JP)—A telephone call through space today established the first two-way conversation via an artificial satellite.

The first using the new Echo 1 giant balloon satellite came just two hours after scientists successfully held the first two-way communication with recording, a spokesman said.

THE CONVERSATION opened the way to a possible age of person-to-person communication by man-made satellite.

The first two-way communication, two hours earlier, had featured recorded messages by President Eisenhower and Senate majority leader Lyndon B. Johnson. The latest attempt was a "live" phone conversation.

As monitored on tape, here is how it sounded:

"HELLO, this is Bill Jakes calling from Phil Tardini at Jet Propulsion Laboratory," the project manager for Bell laboratories said.

"Are you reading me out there?"

"Yes, we're reading you loud and clear," said Jakes. "Sounds pretty good."

AT THAT POINT, the balloon traveling at 13,000 miles an hour passed over the horizon and contact was lost.

But the scientists in the coast were more confident, achieving a bit more with each conversation, they should expand on their brief conversation.

The final pass of the shining satellite two hours later produced negligible results and the weary scientists headed home. The mostly blank pass was blamed on a bad drive track fixing the satellite's orbit.

AFTER 7:30 A.M., the balloon passed to a point no longer on a direct line between California and New Jersey, unavailable for further experiments by the Bell-JPL group for 12 hours.

The bone-tired engineers and lab assistants, many of whom had been working intensely 13 straight hours, said little. They will return to concentrate on minute, detailed work to improve the length and quality of the calls.

At the dramatic moment of the first phone call through space, there was little outward excitement in the Bell lab.

Kissell Home Jumpin' With Space Calls

One consequence of the successful launching of the Echo satellite has been the improved communication between the Kenneth Kissell household and the rest of Dayton.

"We've been getting phone calls all night," said Kissell last night, "all of Dayton must be watching that thing go by."

George Neff, of the Moonwatch team, has been receiving accurate figures on the satellite's Dayton passage ever since Friday.

It's being watched closely, said Kissell, for any indication that the big balloon may be losing its shape.

"The less air, may get out there than there is in the most perfect radio vacuum tube on earth today," he said, adding, "if you were to take a radio tube and break the glass on the tube, it would play better than it does here."

Kissell, who is a research engineer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been timing its optimum sighting times tonight and tomorrow night.

It All Adds Up To Earth And Orbit DAYTON 19 AUG 1960

Echo I "Changes" Course In Sky
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 —
(AP)—Why does the Echo I
communications satellite speed
half its time traveling to the
northeast and the other half
the southwest?

In simple terms, it is because the Earth rotates on its
tilted axis, and the satellite
follows this rotation.

Had Echo been launched
from the equator on a perfect
circle, it would travel always
too low on the horizon for the
relay of radio signals from
various parts of the United
States.

Satellites launched in Polar
orbits also travel a constant
direction, north and south.
They also would spend much
of their time over parts of the
Earth where communications
could be used for communications.

Leonard Jaffe, chief of the
communications satellite project at the National Aeronautics and Space administration, said the Echo I orbit provides the greatest amount of
useful time from the standpoint of communications.

Echo fits better into a clockwork schedule than do other
satellites in semi-equatorial

Satellite Over Dayton
Tonight's Echo I schedule for
Dayton includes: 8:13 p.m.

8:11 p.m. (South), 9:51 p.m.
(North) and 3:51 a.m. (South).

Orbits because its cycle between about two hours.

Thus for six successive orbits—about 12 hours—Echo is
traveling from the southwest
to northeast.

The last of these orbits is
moving almost due north.
Some times the satellite is high
on the horizon and sometimes
the horizon with regard to any
particular place on Earth.

When the Earth has turned
so that North America is on
the opposite side, it changes
position, the satellite for the
next six orbits — 12 hours —
appears from the Earth to be
moving from the northwest to
the southeast.

Discoverer XIV
Goes Into Orbit
1 Missile Deploys After Launch;
2 Others Fired Successfully
By Associated Press

The satellite Discoverer XIV, crammed with secret sky
spying gear, was launched into polar orbit yesterday on the
west coast. Across the continent, two other missiles were fired
successfully, while a third exploded and was wrecked after
launching.

Discoverer XIV roared aloft from Vandenberg Air Force
base, California, a week after a postponement. Discoverer XIV
dropped a nose cone that was recovered. It was a spectacular
first recovery of a man-made object from space.

Goal of yesterday's shot also is
recovery of the satellite's instruments, a special capsule from orbit, by a
tricky aerial catch if possible.
The satellite was equipped with
special instruments designed to
help two upcoming series of surveillance satellites—one to radio
back pictures of terrain if possible
and another to test certain missile firings.

The firing of Discoverer XIV
was delayed 15 minutes because
Discoverer XIII was passing
overhead and its radio tracking
signals might confuse tracking
equipment of Manned Spacecraft.

The Polaris submarine missile, on
the brink of operational readiness, scored another test flight
success over a 1,100-mile course.
Fourteen minutes after firing, it
dropped a dummy nose cone in
an intended target zone northwest
of Puerto Rico.

El was the 23rd success in
31 Polaris missile launchings.
The Polaris success followed
explosion of a carrier rocket
which was designed to put into
orbit a satellite that could load
to a communications network for
all U. S. military forces.

The two-stage rocket blew
up about 50 miles up, trailing
smoke about 2½ minutes after
it left the ground. It was intended
to fling a 51-inch, 500-pound
sphere into a circular orbit 700
miles above the Earth. The
sphere was capable of transmitting and sending 6,000 words
a minute. A chain of such courier
satellites might serve as the
communications network of the
nation's military services.

In Florida, a Bomarc-A interceptor missile blasted a pilotless

No Flying Objects Seen in
Tehama County Last Night

RED BLUFF (E-R) — Those, a
mysterious flying objects first
sighted near here early Sunday
morning by two highway patrol-
men did not make an appearance
last night.

And an Air Force spokesman
said they never did make an ap-
pearance on Air Force radar
screens at the Red Bluff instal-
lation.

Since the sighting by the CHP's
Hanley Scott and Charles A. Car-
son in their patrol car, Tehama
County sheriff's deputies and a
number of citizens have reported
anywhere from one to six of the
objects.

Generally they have been de-
scribed as being airliner-sized,
glowing with a bright white light
and having one or two red lights.

The last sighting was Tuesday
night when two deputies at a
roadblock near Mineral, just west
of Lassen Park, reported they
saw six of the mysterious things
flitting at "terrific" speed without
making a sound.

Almost two dozen others at
Mineral's luxury lodge also re-
ported seeing the same thing.

The objects — four of which
were in tight formation — seem-
ed to be going southwest. The
Tehama County observers said
it happens that southwest lies
Roseville and at least some
Roseville citizens also reported
seeing at least one of them.

Two of the Roseville witnesses
were brothers, Terry and Wal-
lace McGulgan and Sgt.
James Hall, and they later followed the objects out of the city.

"Each was as big as a wash-
tub, apparently," McGulgan said.
"I never would have believed
it if I did not see it myself,"
Hall said. "No airplane could
have traveled that fast."

Tehama deputies Bill Gonzales
and A. D. Perry had staked out
the Mineral roadblock for two
gunmen who had robbed the Bank
of America in Chester.

Gonzales said the things flew
in loose formation, glowing a
brilliant white with a red spot
or spots. He said they were too
far away to tell what the red
spots were.

"They were dipping and diving
and moving at simply unbeliev-
able speed," he said. "And the
really strange part—they didn't
make a sound."

(Normally, if an object exceeds

sonic boom. None was heard.)
A San Francisco meteorologist,
Jack Streetor, has said the objects might be a weather balloon
released nightly from the Red
Bluff weather station.

Tehama deputies and the highway patrolmen, but furthermore, they said, only one balloon is released
and more than one object has
been sighted since the first one
Sunday morning.

Petrofman Scott described the
object he saw Sunday as "big
as a football." He said it seemed to
have a band of windows or portholes and a red searchlight-like
thing on each end.

Tehama County Undersheriff
Jack McGlyn said no written reports have been filed yet by his
office but "it looks like we're going to have to start a file."

Since July 15 the Red Bluff
radar installation has been put
under the SAGE system whereby
its observations are sent directly
to Adair Air Force Base in
Corvallis, Ore.

A spokesman at Corvallis said,
after viewing the radar records,
"there was nothing on the radar.
You can't bounce radar off some-
thing that's not there." He said
98 per cent of UFO sightings here
been explained. In the other
cases, he said, not enough information was available.

The records of the Air Force's UFO investigation
center at Dayton, Ohio's Wright-
Patterson AFB, he said, McClellen said, are in investigating the
sightings in northern California.

Interests in California

An unusually complex combination of events produced an epidemic of UFO sightings in northern California during the week of August 12 to 20, 1960. Nearly every night dozens of reliable citizens throughout Tehama County and the Mount Shasta region (long famous for its mysterious lights) reported UFOs at various times and of various descriptions: round, bright, metallic UFOs glowing a reddish-purple fluorescent type of light, cigar-shaped UFOs trailing a long fiery exhaust, oval UFOs with red lights at each end and white lights in between, yellow-colored UFOs like a flying railroad car with flashing red lights at each end and white lights glowing at the windows. Radios roared with static and radar sets were plagued with phantoms, as the state was apparently invaded by a whole fleet of patrolling saucers.

The most important factor in these sightings was the weather; prolonged and extensive temperature inversions prevailed in the area all that week from southern Oregon through northern Cali-


- page 27 -

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 94—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
forma multiple inversions of 3 to 18 degrees occurred nightly. Un-
der these conditions, practically any light shining into the night was
apt to be projected upward as a mirage and to perform weird an-
tics. Determining what was the particular light source of some spe-
cific phenomenon is almost impossible.

As complicating factors, certain heavenly bodies made their own
contribution to the excitement. Most of the objects observed late
at night and watched for periods of one to three hours were re-
fracted images of the stars Capella or Aldebaran or the planet Mars.

Some of the most spectacular sightings were those reported from
Red Bluff on the night of August 13-14. Two highway patrolmen
were chasing a speeding motorcycle when, at about 11:50 P.M.
P.D.S.T., they saw what they at first supposed to be a brilliantly
lighted aircraft falling directly toward them. Jumping out of their
car, they watched the object as it apparently reversed its course,
shot upward, and began to perform fantastic maneuvers in the cast-
ern sky. The performance continued for more than two hours. Be-
fore it ended, a second UFO had joined in the celestial dance, which
was observed by dozens of excited witnesses in the Red Bluff area.

Air Force base in the neighborhood was notified, and ATIC
investigators gathered and studied the evidence. There was no real
mystery [?]. The UFO first noticed by the patrolmen was probably
the star Capella, which at Red Bluff is circumpolar; it rose at
10:50 P.M. and at the time of the sighting was about 4.7 degrees
above the northeast horizon. About an hour later (12:48 A.M.) Mars
rose, also in the northeast and close behind it (1:15 A.M.) came the
bright star Aldebaran which made a striking pair with Mars. With
three brilliant heavenly bodies just above the horizon, on a night
of fantastic multiple inversions of temperature and humidity, the
only surprising fact is that the number of UFOs reported was not
larger.

A person who has never been lucky enough to see a good mirage
may feel skeptical about the phenomenon. But those who have en-
countered a spectacular example—for example, the Chicago sky-
line suspended upside down in mid-air above Lake Michigan—know
how startlingly real it can seem. When the source of the mirage is
not apparent, the displaced image can seem mysterious and even
frightening, as do many UFOs.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

Near midnight, August 13, 1960, Red Bluffs (Cal) police officers Charles A. Carson and Stanley Scott saw a "glowing, oblong object" with red and white side lights low in the eastern sky directly ahead. Among its characteristics: silent hovering, rapid and acute directional changes incapable of execution by known aircraft.

The officers, keeping a watch which lasted more than two hours, radioed a local Air Force radar station and got a swift, startled reply — "unidentified." Carson and Scott, quickly regaining the calm powers of observation expected of law enforcement officers, watched the object—occasionally beaming its lights to the ground—until it vanished below the eastern horizon.

On August 13 at Corning, California where police officers chased a red-lighted UFO for 2 hours the following was reported. Twice the unknown machine approached the police car, one of its red lights sweeping the ground like a searchlight. One policeman angled their red spotlight upward, and the descending UFO swerved away. Throughout the encounter, a static-like roar drowned the police radio. In the meantime radar screens at the nearby Air Force Base at Red Bluff, California reported a good "hard return" of the unknown on their screens, which indicated a solid object in the vicinity.

SAUCER "FLAP" IN CALIFORNIA:

seems to have been the beginning of some four days after the original sighting on August 19th in recent years. Four days after the original sighting on August 19th by two highway patrolmen, at least 20 people saw a disc near Lassen National Park and fly over Mineral. Mineral was the scene of the August 17th incident. was observed by three Tehama County deputy sheriffs at a road block. One of the saucer, paced and piloted by Bill Gonzales, said that there were two flying high in a loose formation, and flying at a high rate of speed, colored red and white. They were dipping and diving at a "surprisingly unbelievable speed," and made no noise. The objects were in view for approximately a half hour.

At least a dozen other reports were made by individuals and groups throughout that section of California. In some of the close sightings, the saucer was reported to be saucer-shaped and as long as an airliner, with a clear view of its shape. One report near Corning, California, like a searchlight beam - the sighter said the object was hanging stationary over a field, with lights along its side, which was hanging at about a 45-degree angle. Another witness to the sighted UFO near Oroville said he could see a dome-like object to be watched at twilight.

The report filed on August 16th. She reported the object to officials at Hamilton Air Force Base at Novato, and later at San Rafael, and was reportedly meeting only a few miles from the UFO which they might under the UFO for awhile, according to her claim. She said the object was a saucer-like craft. She and her sisters asserted that the UFO later a visible part of the sky, and then disappeared. The UFO disappeared from view a few minutes after.

"They moved too fast

During the weekend two
highway patrolmen and four
deputy sheriffs reported they
witnessed strange objects
maneuvering in the sky
south of Red Bluff, Tehama
County.

The sighting in Roseville
was made first by Mrs. Alice
Painter, who said she and
neighbors, Mr. and Mrs.
Glenn Painter, They said they
all spotted two oblong lighted
objects in the sky which remained stationary, then
bobbing and swaying from
time to time.

Others Watch
The Painter's son, Mike,

and a friend, Walter Gordon,
also went outdoors and said
they witnessed the same sight
did Police Captain Hugh Mc-
Cluggage and Sergeant James
Hall.

The two officers later
went out to Base Line Road
to avoid city lights and stated
they continued to see the
things until they suddenly
vanished.

Mike was as big as a
washtub, apparently.

Painter told a reporter,
"I never would have believed it if I did not see it
myself." Hall declared, "No
one could have traveled
that fast."

Major Friend re the sightings at Red Bluff California, 13 August 1960

Was refraction of the planet Mars and the two bright stars, Aldebaran and Betelgeuse. (This was his first conclusion and he was waiting for weather information)For the whole period of the sightings in this area there were not only inversions but on some days double inversions. Feels positive that the original conclusion is that as stated above.

In instances where people say that they start driving toward the object that is a great distance away, it always gives you the impression of going along with you. Without accurate equipment, the angular deviations are much too small for them to cover.

UFO SIGHTING RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA
12-20 August 1960

Radio KBLF interview of officers [redacted] and [redacted] of highway patrol, Red Bluff Office.

Saturday night, approximately 11:50, almost midnight.

Where did you first spot the unidentified flying object?
East of Corning (?) about 4 miles East of Corning to be exact.

You were on the Hoag (?) road where the people know the area around here, right? Now, what you spotted, we have had a lot of talk and people have called it different things and everything else; so, the best way possible, Mr. Scott, if you could more or less identify what I looked like from where you were this time of the evening.

At first we thought it was an airliner coming down and after looking closer at it and getting out of the car, we realized that it was not a conventional type aircraft. It was surrounded by a bright white glow, a glow of light. It was shaped similar to a football. A row of white lights ran horizontal to the object across the center of it, and on each end there was a red light which would sweep the countryside as the object turned. It pointed the red light in the direction.

How far were you from this when you sighted it the first time?
It is hard to say, not knowing the size of the object. It is possible that we were as close as a half mile or anywhere up to a mile and a half to two miles at the closest.

Something I asked this afternoon, I'll ask him again; but right now, I would like to ask you. The very first moment you saw the unidentified flying object--what was your first feeling?
At first I didn't have any feeling until the object had performed a few maneuvers and then appeared to be coming straight toward the patrol car. At that time, I did get scared and the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I was quite shocked.

Was there over a feeling of fear in any way, form, or was it mostly curiosity or shock, like you say?
Well, I did feel fear just one time there when it first started toward us, and after that, it was more curiosity. We were then trying to find out what it was.

Well, to your own idea now, Mr. Scott more or less explained what it looked like--once again it looked like it had either a row of lights or a row of windows on the side of the object, is this right?
Yes, it appeared to be windows. The windows were only visible when the object would turn at a certain angle to us. It appeared to have to manipulate the machine in order to get this beam to sweep.

in the sense that the beam wasn't movable in itself, that the entire object had to move to move the beam light--this fixed light.
This fixed light was this one the nose and one, more or less, the rear of the ship?
We only saw one beam in operation at a time but both red lights on the front and rear or sides, how ever the case may be, were always visible.

Would you say it was round?
The light or the object?
No, the object itself.
The object was round.
In other words, if someone would say a flying saucer--that is what it looked like?
Yes, that's right.

And it was supposedly hovering over the ground at a certain altitude for a certain length of time right in that area?
That's correct, quite considerable lengths of time it hovered over the ground and appeared motionless.

Well, you know a lot of people have been talking about weather balloons and illusions and so forth; and right now I would like to point out that we have with us members of the California highway patrol and they in no way are seeing any illusions, the big thing we want to point out. And, in checking with the weather bureaus in the San Francisco Bay area--there were two balloons let out with red and white lights but these balloons were never in the area where the officers were. And so, if anyone has the idea that this is an illusion, no, it is not!

And something else, too, I would like to bring out and that is the fact that you on Mr. Scott put the red light on the object.
That was officer Scott, he propped (?) the red light on the object.

What happened then?
Well, then the object moved away from us, and we followed it in the patrol car at which time we lost sight of it. We stopped after several miles and got out the patrol car and, as I recall, we climbed on the hood of the car to look over a knoll. There it was, looking right back at us.
Good feeling, right?
It was hovering about a mile away. At this time it appeared to be about a mile away.

Well, was saying earlier that at one time it was behind the hill and all at once it seemed to jump over the hill.
That was the time.
It appeared a lot closer that what it was.

How big would you say the object was?
As large or larger than an airliner.
Could you say in feet approximately?
About 150 to 200 feet.


- page 88 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

How close would you say that you ever got to the flying object?
Well, like I said, not knowing the exact size of the object
and just judging from the lights, we couldn't get too much of an
extremely accurate--it would be a guess, but we figure anywhere from
a half mile to a mile and a half.

Well, let's see, in your own thoughts, naturally in your own
opinion, do you have any idea what it might be? What is your own
opinion?
Not in the slightest. I wouldn't even care to form an opinion.
I would like to know what it is.
Still amazed?

This was Saturday night. I heard reports too, that it was
also sighted last night by residents in the area and it seems to
be coming back to the same spot. Do you think there might be a
possible chance that it would return to this same spot tonight or
some time in the future?
Well, could be.
Could be, right:

Well, after all this night's work, Mr. Scott, what was your
feeling after you returned home and heard, of course, on newscasts
and read in newspapers and magazines about people who spotted such
objects and people saying some weird things about them? How did
you feel yourself, especially after you reported this to the high-
way patrol office?
Well, I could hardly believe what I had seen out there and I
was thankful for the fact that there were other officers from
different agencies that had seen the object, plus residents of
the area and people traveling through because myself--I don't think
if I had seen it and no one else had seen it--I would have been
pretty confused.

(The object was seen by:) You and and three deputies
and a couple of prisoners from the jail and some city police plus
some residents from the area. It would really be quite a thing to
come across something like this. Were you in the area on a regular
routine patrol?
We were on routine patrol. We were the only car in the county
that night and we were covering the entire county.

After you had come across this thing, you reported it to the
highway patrol office?
No, we reported it to the dispatcher at the sheriff's office.
We don't have a dispatcher here at Red Bluff.
They in turn sent down three deputies, was that the idea?
Yes, that is what they did.

You say then it was more of a saucer shape than a cigar shape?
It could have been either one. Not being directly under it
and not getting the full view of the under side of the thing or
never having the machine turn cross ways in front of us it is

(would be) difficult to say even in the daytime--you could not determine whether it was round or oblong.

Well, do you say this, that maybe perhaps it knew of your presence there especially with this red light on?
I firmly believe it was aware of the presence of the light because the object moved away immediately. As officer Scott brought the red light on, it moved directly away from us.

Well, then it did move away. Did it move away slowly or did it do this all at once, with speed?
It moved away fairly fast. It moved so swiftly that we lost sight of it. That is when we lost it the first time.
I see, like it did notice the red light and it was leaving the area.
Then did it return after you put the red light ...
TB came back towards us on one occasion.

Let's put it this way, how do you feel about the whole situation right now?
I am like officer Scott; I still find it rather difficult to believe even after watching. It was amazing to sit out there for two hours and fifteen minutes watching this thing, and it is even more difficult to tell someone else what you saw. It is quite an experience. That is all you could say about it.

So, if someone would say to you that you felt you saw a balloon or an optical illusion, what would you say?
I would say that I wish that person had been sitting where I was and I had been sitting home.

Is that your same feeling, Mr. Scott?
That's right, it was definitely not a balloon or optical illusion. We saw something out there.
It was a UFO, an unidentified flying object. I can see what you mean.

Well, there it is. In other words, we have an unidentified flying object, maybe never again, then again we might.

This is in the area on highway 99 E and as a guess it was approximately 200 feet (sq ft ?) in diameter, and had weird lights and so forth, and hovering over the ground down there, and shifting from back and forth and, once again, it was not an optical illusion: it was there.

Well, would you like to say anything to sort of wrap this up. I know you have been busy all day long and both Mr. Scott and Mr. Carson have been with the wire service and the television all day and now I have them cornered, too, trying to get more out of them; but after this experience tied up with press and everything else, what do you think of it now?
Oh, even with the press it was quite an experience. I think most of the reporters and people we talked to were quite impressed due to the number of creditable people that saw the thing. I go along with Scott 100 per cent. I am sure glad I wasn't there by myself. If I had been, I would have gone home and thought it over by myself before reporting it.


- page 90 -

-5-

Isn't it true that someone in the area at the time traveling through called in somewhere and reported, more or less, confirming your report of the same object?
Yes, two people from San Francisco called today to report that they had seen the object in the area at that time as they were passing through on highway 99 E.

How many people would you say saw the object that you know of that night?
I have no idea. There was, I believe, at least 8 of us at that time that we knew of right then that was watching the object. However, I do know that some people have called the highway patrol reporting that they also saw the object. Of course, this happened today after the story broke.
I was talking to some of the residents of the area and they said too that they also spotted the object. (narrator)

Well, gentlemen, since time is running out I would like to take the opportunity to say thanks after a busy day with press and with the office work and so forth. I would like to thank you a lot for taking the time and coming out here. To me this is a fantastic story. I think it is just fabulous and like you said, I am glad you weren't alone because if I were in the position I would feel the very same way. So, thank you so very much.

We have officer Scott and officer Carson here, Highway Patrol, Red Bluff Office.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

Officer [redacted] and I were EB on Hoag Road, east of Corning looking for a speeding motorcycle when we saw what at first appeared to be a huge airborne dropping from the sky. The object was very low and directly in front of us. We slowed and leaped the patrol vehicle in order to get a position on what we were sure was going to be an airplane crash. From our position outside the car the first thing we noticed was an absolute silence. Still assuming it to be an aircraft with power off we continued to watch until the object was probably within 100' to 200' of the ground when it suddenly reversed completely, at high speed and gained approximately 500' altitude. There the object stopped, at this time it was clearly visible to both of us and obviously not an aircraft of any design familiar to us. It was surrounded by a glow making the round or oblong object visible. At each end, or each side of the object there were definite red lights. At times about five white lights were visible between the red lights. As we watched the object moved a-1 and performed aerial feats that were actually unbelievable.

At this time we radioed Tehama County Sheriff's Office requesting they contact local radar base. The Radar Base confirmed the U.F.O. - completely unidentified.

Officer [redacted] and myself, after our verification continued to watch the object. On two occasions the object came directly towards the patrol vehicle, and on the 1st approach, the object turned, swept the area with a huge red light. Officer [redacted] turned the red light on the patrol vehicle towards the object and it immediately went away from us. We observed the object use the red beam approximately 6 or 7 times, sweeping the sky and ground areas. The object began moving slowly in an easterly direction and we followed. We proceeded to the Yreka Plains fire station where we again were able to locate the object. As we watched it was approached by a similar object from the south. We moved near the first object - and both stopped, remaining in that position for some time, occasionally emitting the red beam.

Finally both objects disappeared below the eastern horizon.
We returned to the Tehama County Sheriff's Office and met
Deputy [redacted] and Deputy [redacted], who had gone to Los Molinos
after contacting the Radar Base. Both had seen the U. F. O.
clearly and described to us what we saw. The night jailer was also
able to see the object and its maneuvers exactly as we saw them. We first saw
the object at 2350 hours and observed it for approximately two
hours and 15 minutes. Each time the object neared us we
experienced radio interference.

We submit this report in confidence for your information, we
were calm after our initial shock and decided to observe and
record all we could of the object.

No Case (Information Only)                                   5 August 1960
                                                        between Moulle & Lille, France

NEAR-LANDING IN FRANCE: One of the closest sightings in a long time occurred last August 5th between the towns of Moulle and Lille in France.

A man named Daniel Thot and his wife were driving home from a visit with relatives, when a very strange round object was blocked the highway in front of them. It was the color of the setting sun, and was only a few feet across. The UFO was moved to one side of the highway and let the car pass, but it continued to follow Thot and his frightened wife. The object was about 15 feet high and 10 feet wide, and brightly lighted on the bottom, where the upper part was dark and somewhat transparent. Thot claimed he saw a human form within the strange machine, but he was able to give no details. - The incident occurred late at night, and there were no other witnesses.

RED BLUFF DAILY NEWS    17 AUGUST 1960

Highway Patrolmen Charles A. Carson and Stanley E. Scott (left to right) have been busy for days giving accounts of their unidentified flying objects story to papers, radio and television all over the state. Some of those who in the past chalked off this type of UFO accounts are now looking a little more concerned.

The story of the huge object emitting white and red lights at low levels over various parts of the county has been confirmed by eight peace officers plus other citizens.
