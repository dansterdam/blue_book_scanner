REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

On 2 January 1967, special agent investigated the alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on 6 January 1967. 

The object was first observed at approximately 2100 hours by Mr. Howard Snyder, a resident of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The object was described as a dark, rectangular-shaped object, approximately 30 to 40 feet in length, which appeared to hover or move slowly over the Lehigh University campus.

Mr. Snyder reported that he observed the object for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. He stated that the object appeared to be metallic and gave off no sound. He estimated the altitude of the object to be between 500 and 1000 feet.

The investigation revealed that several other residents of Bethlehem also reported observing the same or a similar object at approximately the same time and location as Mr. Snyder's sighting. However, no other physical evidence or corroborating witnesses could be found to substantiate the reports.

Based on the available information, this case is listed as UNIDENTIFIED.
