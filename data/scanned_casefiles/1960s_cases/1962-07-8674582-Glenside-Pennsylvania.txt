16. Tall in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Rushing, hissing noise
b. Color: Bright white light

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please on arrow-in-side the direction the object was moving.

The observer has not provided any drawn sketch or image, only text responses.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The page contains text with numbered questions, likely for the witness to fill out as part of the reporting process.

OCR output:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Please an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

- page 11 -

The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch appears to show a curved line with an object above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road in a rural or suburban setting. The third sketch shows a smaller version of the second sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch to show an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
