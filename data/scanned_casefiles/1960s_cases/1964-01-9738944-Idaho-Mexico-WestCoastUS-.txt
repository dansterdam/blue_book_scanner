SAF-OIPC, BSE, SCE AND DXI. A MINUTEMAN LAUNCH FROM
VANDENBERG AFB ON 24 JAN 1964 WAS SEEN FROM IDAHO TO MEXICO
AND RESULTED IN OVER 120 TELEPHONE QUERIES FROM NEWS MEDIA
AND CIVIL AUTHORITIES. THE LAUNCH
OCCURRED AT TWILIGHT AND CREATED AND PREDICTABLE METEOROLOGICAL
PHENOMENA. THE SAME PHENOMENA OCCURS DURING A PRE-DAWN
LAUNCH. TO PRECLUDE UNDUE PUBLIC SPECULATION AND CONCERN,

LAUNCHED TODAY BY THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FROM VANDENBERG
AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF. THE MISSILE, THE (NUMBER) OF ITS
KIND LAUNCHED FROM THIS AEROSPACE CENTER, WAS A ROUTINE
TRAINING LAUNCH BY A STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND MISSILE COMBAT CREW
OF AN OPERATIONAL MISSILE. PARA. THE MISSILE LIFTED OFF
FROM ITS (SILO, LAUNCH FACILITY) DURING THE (DAWN, DUSK) HOURS.
AS IT ROSE FROM THE EARTH'S SHADOW INTO THE SUNLIGHT, IT GAVE
THE EFFECT OF AN EXPLOSION, FORMING VARIED COLORED PATTERNS
IN THE SKIES. PRELIMINARY REPORTS INDICATED THAT (THE MISSILE
IS ON COURSE (IT IMPACTED IN THE PACIFIC MISSILE RANGE). PARA.
CREW MEMBERS ASSIGNED TO THE (BLNK) MISSILE SQUADRON, (BLNK)
AFB, (BLANK), WERE: UNQUOTE. FILLER MATERIAL IN RESPONSE TO
QUERY ONLY: QUOTE. VIEWERS OF MISSILE LAUNCHES, IN CERTAIN
AREAS MILES DISTANT FROM LAUNCH SITE, SEE WHAT IS
APPARENTLY A VIOLENT EXPLOSION. PARA. THIS APPARENT
EXPLOSION IS VISIBLE DUE TO THE NATURAL PHENOMENA CAUSED BY
THE GRADUAL LESSENING OF DENSITY FROM THE EARTH TO THE OUTER
FRINGES OF THE ATMOSPHERE, AND THE PERIOD OF THE DAY WHEN IT
OCCURS. PARA. THE DENSITY AFFECTS THE EXHAUST GASES IN THAT
THE TRAIL IS HELD IN NARROW CONFINES NEAR THE EARTH, BROADENING

AS THE MISSILE LIFTS HIGHER INTO SPACE, PARA. THE PERIOD OF
THE DAY IN WHICH THE LAUNCH MAY APPEAR AS AN EXPLOSION IS
USUALLY THE TWILIGHT HOURS BEFORE DAWN OR AFTER SUNSET. AT
THOSE TIMES, THE EARTH'S SHADOW COMBINED WITH THE DENSITY
VARIATION CAUSES REFLECTED RAYS OF SUNLIGHT TO BE VISIBLE IN
DIFFERENT COLORS. THEN THE EARTH'S SHADOW EXTENDS TO THE EDGE
OF SPACE AND THE EXPANSION OF EXHAUST GASES IS MOST EFFECTIVE.
PARA. THE EXHAUST TRAIL IS VISIBLE IN EVERY SPACE VEHICLE
WHERE COMBUSTION IS INCOMPLETE. THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMANDS.
TITAN II ICBM IS THE ONLY EXCEPTION, SINCE IT HAS ALMOST
COMPLETE COMBUSTION. UNQUOTE. THE ADDITION OF THIS RELEASE
OPTION AND THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR USE IN ANSWER TO
QUERY SHOULD GREATLY LESSEN FUTURE PROBLEMS DURING EVENING
AND PRE-DAWN LAUNCHES.
