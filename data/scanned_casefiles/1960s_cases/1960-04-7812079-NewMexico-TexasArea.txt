REPLY TO
ATTN OF: Lt McKay, SDO, 16 April 1960
SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: Major Friend, ATIC-443

1. Major Brandt, USAF Command Post, called ATIC 16/2220, to relay UFO Report received by USAF Command Post from a Major Francis of TAC COC at 16/2200, who had received the report from a Major Harrison, Intelligence Officer, 832nd Air Division, Cannon AFB, who had received the original report of the UFO sighting approximately 16/2103 from a Lt. Dunn, F-100 pilot, airborne at the time of sighting and a Captain Mason of Clovis, New Mexico home at the time of sighting. (All times used are EST). The USAF Intellications Center, NORAD and ATIC were all on a conference tie-up for this telephone report. The reports are as follows:

a. Lt. Dunn - Flying F-100 (altitude not available) reported seeing one object, bluish-white with a red tail, similar in appearance to a pistol flare, descending 340 degrees to 350 degrees magnetic egainst a descending sun. Visible approximately 10 (2) seconds. 16/2103 EST.

b. Captain Mason - From his home in Clovis, New Mexico, Cpt. Mason saw an object which he describes as in a. above. He added that he saw pieces flying from it.

2. Cannon AFB reports that no planes were in the area or responsible for this sighting.

3. At 2330 16/2250 EST USAF Command Post, USAF Indications Center, NORAD and ATIC again held telecon. Reports of a similar nature have been coming in from Amarillo, Texas, Clovis and Albuquerque, N.M. Reports also were received from a TWA Continental northwest of Amarillo at 16/2200 EST. Reports vary in estimated altitude ranging from 200 feet to 1very, very high. All agree only one object, traveling fast, northeast to southwest. Weather report for the wide area of reporting (NORAD report) is virtually cloudless with some blowing sand. In the Texas reporting area, Participants of telecon seem to agree that because of the relative times of all reports, 1900 - 2200 EST, that the object apparently was a meteor.

4. Standing by for more telecons. 2330 hours. All quiet. 17/0145.
