December 19, 1963

Dear Mr.

Your letter of December 4, 1963, addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in which you reported the sighting of a satellite, was forwarded with the responsibility of investigating unusual aerial phenomena.

We would like to thank you for your excellent report on this satellite. As seen by a check of the official records, Cosmos check book, Czechoslovak areas that on December 3rd, and your report indicates a check on December 2nd, you sighted the satellite distinguished in the conflict of the time may will be the difference in the conflict as culled in the conflict or the conflict. Your observation has all the characteristics of a satellite.

Once again, our thanks for your interest in reporting this aerial phenomena to the United States officials.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting by [REDACTED]

TO: HQ USAF SAF-OIPR (Mrs Gaiser)
Wash 25 D C

16 DEC 1963

1. Reference the attached letter from [REDACTED] dated 4 Dec 63, giving information on an unidentified object sighting. We wish to thank [REDACTED] for his excellent report on what appears to be a satellite decay.

2. A check with SPADATS reveals that on 3 Dec 63 a Cosmos rocket body re-entered the earth's atmosphere. The report from [REDACTED] indicates that his observation was on 2 Dec 63. Although SPADATS records show no specific decay for 2 Dec the observation by [REDACTED] and his crew has all the characteristics of a satellite re-entry.

Dear Sirs,

I wish to report having observed what I believe to have been re-entry into atmosphere and disintegration of a Satellite. Details of this observation are tabled below.

I was actually facing the approach direction at the time, and my immediate reaction was to classify the object as a Satellite. Within two or three seconds as small tell was visible, and the object's inclination was such as to give the impression of a comet with a very definite meaning near the vessel's position. Brilliance and apparent speed rapidly increased, and object was compared to split, giving impression at this stage, of a binary comet of incredible speed.

On reaching its zenith, between stage 2 and 3, the object was seen to sub-divide and lose brilliance, becoming five lesser objects which quickly lost magnitude, until at stage 4 only the tail remained and the quickly dispersal almost parallel with the Earth's surface, and the duration of this observation was 55 seconds.

At stage 3 the tail was an estimated 30° or arc wide, this width continued until final dispersal. Except in final stages, the entire trajectory of the object appeared to be almost parallel with the Earth's surface, and the duration of the observation was 55 seconds.

Having observed countless meteorites during a lifetime at sea, I am certain the object was not in that category, duration seldom exceeding three seconds.
