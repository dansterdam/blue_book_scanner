At about 9:15 mst, I (1900) went out to play with my dog on game 19, 1962, after dinner inside 9 defense way. I immediately recognized it was a flying object. I was about 8-20 ft away, the 11 "a" of 9 was at that point. I thought it was a satellite, the dome called itself and I would see it. The information, that I was familiar with the place of it was in our country. I was very close at the time else not place of it was in our country. I was very close at the time else not place of it was in our country. I was very close at the time else not place of it was in our country.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

A. I think it would have been 1/2 inch at most. Not all of the object was covered because of the distance.

It would not completely look like a ball or a star. Texture was not smooth & mostly metallic. Might be like a cloud, square, solid as what was in the sky. Would describe it not even though of shape.
