27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I THINK I'VE COVERED EVERY THING ELSE WHERE IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

ON APRIL 1, 1968 MY HUSBAND AND I WERE IN OUR LIVING ROOM AND HAVING COFFEE ASLEEP IN THE CHAIRS WERE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME ATTRACTED BY A STRANGE SOUND AND IT WAS SO LOUD I WAS LOOKING FOR THE SOURCE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN LOOKING FOR THE DOGS WERE ACTING STRANGE AND BARKING IN A FRIGHTENED WAY. WE KEPT LOOKING OUT THE LANE FOR SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION FOR THE NOISE AND WE TURNED ALL OF OUR OUTSIDE LIGHTS ON. THE NOISE GRADUALLY LESSENED AND WE WENT ON TO OUR BEDROOM AND MY HUSBAND GLANCED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAID HERE IT IS -- -- AND I NOT BELIEVING WHAT I WAS SEEING SAID IT WAS A SUNSET AND WE TURNED ON THE LIGHTS TO SEE THE TIME. SINCE WE HAD BEEN ASLEEP AND DIDN'T HAVE THE SENSE OF TIME WE TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS AGAIN AND WATCHED IT ALL SINCE IT WAS DIM AND IT COULD BE SEEN BETTER IN THE DARK UNTIL THE LIGHT COULD BE SEEN IN THE HORIZON. AFTER 5 MINUTES I TURNED THE LIGHT ON AND LOOKED AT THE CLOCK ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT COULD STILL BE SEEN AS A DIM LIGHT ON THE HORIZON.

THE SOUND RESEMBLED THE SOUND

OF POWER LINES ON A VERY COLD DAY, THE INTENSITY OF THE HUM WAS MUCH LOUDER THAN THE SOUND OF THE POWER LINES.

I HEARD THE SAME SOUND APPROXIMATELY WITHIN A MONTH BEFORE THIS (APRIL) BUT WAS BY MYSELF AND DID NOT CHECK IT OUT BECAUSE I WAS FRIGHTENED AND WENT TO BED.

I AM NOT SURE OF THE TIME PERIOD WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS SOUND.

BECAUSE WE DIDN'T NOTE THE DATE UNTIL WE BOTH SAW THIS ON APRIL 1.

SINCE APRIL 1, WE HAVE NOT HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING RESEMBLING WHAT WE BOTH SAW ON APRIL 1, 1968 AT 10:45 PM.

APRIL 13, 1968

DEAR SIRS,

MY HUSBAND AND I FELT THAT WE COULD SEND THIS DRAWING TO YOU AND IF THE AIR FORCE IS TESTING SOMETHING IN THIS AREA THEN YOU CAN DISREGARD OUR INQUISITIVENESS.

ABOUT ONE MONTH AGO I WAS BY MYSELF AND I HEARD A STRANGE SOUND AND SINCE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE SOUND WAS COMING FROM I BECAME FRIGHTENED AND WENT TO BED. ON APRIL 9, 1968

I HEARD THE SAME SOUND (IT'S POWER LINES ON A VERY COLD DAY) AND MY HUSBAND WAS HOME SO WE INVESTIGATED.

(OUR WATCH DOGS WERE BARKING AND SEEMED TO BE VERY FRIGHTENED)

AT THE TIME WE HAD BOTH FILLED A CELL IN THE LIVING ROOM AND THE INTENSITY OF THE SOUND WERE US BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. WE TURNED ON ALL THE OUTSIDE LIGHTS AND LOOKED

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Practically everywhere but in the sky, because the noise just didn't resemble an airborne object. When we couldn't find the source of the noise we decided to go to bed and that's it. The whole thing, my husband just happened to glance out the window and said well, I don't know what it is but, there it is. Of course, I believe what I was seeing and I rationalized that it was the constellation the west we turned on the light and parked that since it was 10:45 that the sun had set a few hours before and the sun wouldn't be moving that fast or making that peculiar noise. We listened to the radio the next day and didn't hear any reports of anything being tested in this area. So if this helps you in any way we felt that at least we should send the information and rise being added a couple of notes. Sincerely yours,

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Frankfort, Kentucky, which occurred on 1 April 1968 at approximately 10:45 pm.

2. The witness sighted an extremely bright yellow light that moved from the east to the west. The light seemed to have a yellow halo around it and the observer compared the light to that of the setting sun. During the sighting the witness heard a sound similar to the 60 cycle hum set up by high tension electrical wires.

3. Did you receive any reports of unusual objects for this date? We would appreciate your comments as to a possible cause for this sighting.

UFO Observation, 1 April 1963

Fort Mitchell, Kentucky 41017

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified Flying Object (UFO) report from Kentucky. The sighting occurred on 1 April 1963, at approximately 1045 pm, five miles north of Frankfort, Kentucky. The description is similar to those we have received on your aerial advertising planes. If your plane was in the area on the above date, we would appreciate hearing from you.

2. I hope Elizabethtown is receiving a lot of response from your recent advertising for them. Our UFO reports indicate that many, many persons from the greater Miami Valley area have been observing your place; on the nights you have been flying, the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson has been flooded with telephone calls of seeing a "flying object."

3. If your plane is going to be in the Dayton area in the near future, would you drop us a note, or call us collect, as to an approximate time you are going to be overhead. Our office staff would like to be outdoors to see a "UFO," unfortunately, we haven't seen any as yet and would like to get a first hand look at your electrical advertising. I feel it would be of value to us in evaluating other reports from other sections throughout the United States. Our telephone numbers are: area code 513, 25-70916/76678.

4. Once again, thank you for your continued assistance in providing data on your aerial advertising.

SOLID OR GASEOUS, IF THE LIGHT BLINKED OR WAS CONSTANT, AND IF THE NOISE WAS LESS AUDIBLE AS THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY. The Frankfort police dept. was contacted but they had not received any similar reports. It is possible that the object may have been an electrical aerial advertizer who operates in the area but the available information does not warrant this evaluation.

1a. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? WE WERE PULLED IN LIVING ROOM AFTER SUPPER AND WE WERE BOTH WONDERING BY THIS NOISE. SINCE WE LIVE ON A DEAD END ROAD IN THE COUNTRY WE SOON WANTED TO KNOW TO FIND OUT THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUND SINCE IT SEEMED SO LOUD AND OUR TWO WATCH DOGS WERE BARKING.

BUT SEEMING VERY FRIGHTENED, WE TURNED ON ALL OUTSIDE LIGHTS BUT FAILED TO LOOK IN THE SKY BECAUSE I WAS SOMEWHAT UNEASY.

SO ODD THAT ONE WOULDN'T THINK OF LOOKING UP FOR SUCH A SOUND. WELL WHEN WE WENT BACK INSIDE ROOM AND STILL WONDERING WHAT THIS COULD BE BUT NOTICING THE SOUND WASN'T AS LOUD AS BEFORE MY HUSBAND LOOKED OUT A MOMENTARILY DISAPPEARED AND SAID "I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT THERE IT IS."

I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS THE SUN SETTING NOW WE TURNED ON THE LIGHTS TO SEE IT BETTER AND ALSO THE RATE OF SPEED OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT RULED THIS OUT. WE STOOD IN THE WINDOW WITH THE LIGHTS OUT AND WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES AND WHEN WE QUIT WATCHING THE ORIGIN STILL BE SEEN ON THE HORIZON.
