11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers were asleep when they were awakened by a loud noise similar to noise power lines make on a cold day. When the source of the noise couldn't be discovered they decided to go to the door. Just then they sighted the object through the window. It appeared as a dull yellow-ish light that traveled in about 5 minutes. They observed that their dogs were barking and seemed very frightened.

COMMENTS: A form 117 was sent to the observer but was not returned. It is unknown if the object passed in front of or behind anything, or if the light appeared to go off.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
    ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:

I saw a very large object which I can only describe as a very strange, flittering, hovering white object with strange sounds and lights. This object was first noticed on April 6, 1967, by my husband and I where it was seen rising from the ground of the park area where we were. 
The object gave off a very bright light and was so bright that it was hard to look directly at it. The object hovered in the sky and made a strange sound which I can only describe as a high-pitched humming. 
At times the object seemed to disappear and then reappear in a different location. The object was so bright that it lit up the entire area and we turned off the lights of our car so that we could better observe the object.
As we watched the object, it seemed to be maneuvering in various directions and at one point seemed to become translucent. We could see parts of the sky through the object as if it was partly transparent.
After observing the object for approximately 45 minutes, it suddenly shot up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. We were quite amazed and perplexed by what we had witnessed and discussed it for some time afterwards. 
I am still not certain what it was that we saw that night, but I am convinced that it was some type of unidentified flying object. I was not wearing glasses and we were both sober, so I know that it was not a figment of our imagination.
We turned off the lights of the car again, and the object could still be seen, much brighter than before. It looked as if the object was hovering some distance away and then it seemed to come closer.
The light could be seen on the horizon, although at times it seemed to disappear and then reappear. I looked at the clock although the object, and it seemed to have been a little over an hour since we first noticed it.
The sound reminded me of a high-pitched humming noise, although at times it seemed to change in pitch and intensity.
We could not determine the size or distance of the object, although it appeared to be very large. It seemed to hover motionless at times, and at other times it moved quickly in various directions.
After approximately 45 minutes, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE:
ON APRIL 8 VERY COLD DAY THE INTENSITY OF THE POWER LINE INCREASED TO AN EXTENT THAT IT GLOWED RED AND WAS GREATER THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN IT UP CLOSE - THE POWER LINE.
I HEARD THE SAME NOISE AS HEARD BEFORE WHEN NOT MUCH ACTIVITY OCCURRED. AND WAS JUST THE SAME AS EXPERIENCED EARLIER, BECAUSE IT WAS A PREVIOUS VISIT AND WENT TO GET EXT, I AM NOT SURE OF THE TIME PERIOD WAS WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS ON APRIL 1, BUT WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING UNTIL WE GOT BOTH SNOW AND RAIN ON APRIL 8.
SINCE APRIL I WE HAVE NOT HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING RESEMBLING WHAT WE BOTH SAW ON APRIL 1, 1968 AT 10:45 PM.

APRIL 13, 1968

DEAR SIR:

MY NEPHEW AND I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD SENT THIS REGARDING TO YOU AND ALSO TO SEE IF SOMEONE CAN ASSIST IN SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED.

ON APRIL 13, 1968, ABOUT 9:15 P.M., I SAW WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A CRAFT ABOUT 200 FEET IN DIAMETER HOVERING OVER OUR CAR AND MY NEPHEW AND I ALSO SAW IT.

IT WAS A VERY LARGE AND ROUND UFO AND I SHOOK AND WAS VERY APPREHENSIVE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND WAS HOPING IT WOULD NOT COME CLOSER AND ABDUCT US. 

AFTER A FEW MINUTES, IT SLOWLY BEGAN TO ASCEND AND THEN WE COULD DISCERN 3 ROWS OF BRIGHT LIGHTS AROUND THE CRAFT. 

WHEN IT WAS LEAVING, IT ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND SOON BECAME A SMALL BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE. 

AND WENT TO POOL ON APRIL 13, 1968 AND MY NEPHEW TOLD THE SAME SOUND HIS FATHER HEARD (HIS FATHER WAS SOME 2 MILES AWAY AND HAD ALSO OBSERVED THE UFO).

HESBAND WAS FRIGHTENED AND HIS SON WAS EQUALLY SO (OUR WHICH GOES WERE PARKED PARKING AND SEEMED TO BE VERY FRIGHTENED).

AT THE SCENE, AND BOTH WERE QUITE SHAKEN AND FELT THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS VERY FRIGHTENING.

I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD FORWARD THIS TO APPROPRIATE SOURCES AND TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE CAN SHED SOME LIGHT AND GIVE US INFORMATION REGARDING THIS INCIDENT.

SINCERELY,

[SIGNATURE]

WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FAIRLY TYPICAL OR COMMON PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED FOR SOME TIME AND SAID WELL DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS, OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE UNCONVENTIONAL RISING FROM SOME SCIENTIFIC SOURCE AND POSSIBLY THE REST SIMPLY THE USUAL WE CANNOT SAY DEFINITELY, IT WAS BRIGHT AND RAPID THAT SINCE IT WAS LOW ENOUGH COULD BE PLANE AIRCRAFT BLOTCH AND PROBABLY MAKING THAT THE UNK AND SET NOW ACCOUNT AS UNIDENTIFIED.

"UFO OBSERVATION, 1 APRIL 1963
Fort Mitchell, Kentucky 41017
The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report submitted on 1 April 1963. The sighting occurred on the outskirts of Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. The description is similar to those we have received on your radar advertising flying saucers. If your plans warrant it, we would appreciate hearing from you.
2. We would be interested in receiving a lot of response from your recent advertising for them. Our UFO reports indicate that many persons from the greater Cincinnati Valley area have been circulating reports of flying objects seen in your skies on the nights you have been flying. The Duty Officer and I would be glad to telephone calls or assisting in identifying these 'flying objects'.
3. If your plane is going to be in the Dayton area in the near future, would you drop us a note, or call us collect, as to an approximate time you are going to be there. Our office staff would like to be on hand to observe your activities.
It would be our privilege to get a first hand look at your electrical advertising. I would be of value to us in evaluating other reports from other sections throughout the United States. Our telephone numbers are:
area code 513 - 225-7095/7679.
