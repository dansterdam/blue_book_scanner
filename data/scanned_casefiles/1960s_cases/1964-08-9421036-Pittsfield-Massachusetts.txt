On 9 august 1964

1. At approximately 9:15 P.M. EDT on 9 August 1964, Mr. and Mrs. X, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over their home. The object was first sighted at an angle of approximately 50 degrees above the southwestern horizon.

The object was described as round in shape and appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. It had a glowing, luminous quality, and appeared to flash or blink at irregular intervals.

3. After moving in a northeasterly direction for approximately 5 minutes, the object stopped and hovered for several minutes. It then resumed its northeasterly movement and disappeared from sight behind some trees.

4. No sound was heard associated with the object, and it did not appear to leave any trails or other visible effects in the sky.

5. Mr. and Mrs. X are reliable observers, and their description of the object is consistent with other unidentified flying object reports received by this office.
