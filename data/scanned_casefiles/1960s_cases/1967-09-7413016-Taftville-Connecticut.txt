PROJECT 10573 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 17 Sept 67  17/2100Z

2. LOCATION: Taftville, Connecticut (2 witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: NE - E

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
- The observer sighted a large florescent light in the sky. The object was stationary and slowly moving at other times.
- The object apparently turned and gave the appearance of having two windows completely separated but very close to each other.
- There was no noise at all and lights suddenly went out and the whole object disappeared.

COMMENTS: The observer wrote in Jun 68 that she and her mother had seen the object "a few weeks ago." This statement conflicts with the date given on the completed 117. The description itself is consistent with that of an aircraft with an electrical advertising sign. However, the sighting is being evaluated as INSUFFICIENT DATA since it was not reported to the Air Force within 30 days and was therefore too old to investigate.

FORM: FTD SEP 63 03-329 (TDE)

Dear Sir:

I am a student in the eighth grade and interested in UFOs.

I became especially interested when one night a few weeks ago, my mother and I witnessed a large ( size of dinner plate ) flourescent looking object in the sky. The object was stationery and moving slowly at ether times. We among other people observed it for at least ten minutes hovering in the sky. The object apparently turned and gave the appearance of having two windows, completely separated but very close to each other. As we had stepped out of the car we noticed no noise at all. The lights on it suddenly went out and the whole object disappeared. As we live in a rural area there were no other aircraft or lights around so we could not be mistaken.

I understand that you put out some literature ( Project Bluebook ) every February. Would you please send me the latest edition as I already have the one from 1966. Would you please send me the latest you have ? Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
