These predictions are based on orbital elements listed on May 20, 1963.
T = May 21, 1963 from 0 to 24 hrs.

SATELLITE 1960 IOTA 1
FOR GIVEN LATITUDES

MAY 21, 1963

[The document contains multiple tables with numerical data showing satellite tracking information for different dates in May and June 1963, with columns for time, latitude, longitude, and other orbital parameters. The tables are dense with numerical values and appear to be tracking data for a specific satellite (1960 IOTA 1).]

The document covers dates from May 21 to June 1, 1963, with detailed orbital tracking information presented in tabular format.
