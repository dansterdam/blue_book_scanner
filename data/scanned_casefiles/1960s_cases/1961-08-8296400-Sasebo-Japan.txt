This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a form or record card used for Project 10073, which was likely part of the Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form is divided into several sections, including "Date", "Location", "Type of Observation", "Number of Objects", "Course", and "Brief Summary of Sighting". The form seems to be filled out with handwritten information, but the specific details are not legible in the image provided.

11. COMMENTS: Apparently the objects observed did not represent a threat to the ship or aircraft in the area, and their nature remains undetermined. A further investigation into this incident may be warranted to obtain additional information and details.
