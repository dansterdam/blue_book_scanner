PROJECT BLUE BOOK
REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
DETAILED REPORT ON INCIDENT INVESTIGATING REPORT #7981023
LOCATION: PARSIPPANY, NEW JERSEY
DATE: NOVEMBER 6, 1967

Narrative: On November 6, 1967, at approximately 10:25 PM, local police received a call reporting an unidentified flying object over Parsippany, New Jersey. Several officers were dispatched to investigate. One officer, William Johnson, was able to obtain a series of photographs of the object before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The photographs show a lenticular-shaped craft with a bright glow underneath, hovering silently in the night sky. No other details of the craft's structure or operation were observed. The object's flight path and manner of departure suggest a high-performance, highly maneuverable vehicle of unknown origin.

Investigation into this incident is ongoing. The photographs and witness statements have been carefully analyzed, but no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the nature and origin of the observed phenomenon.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION 

INVESTIGATOR: WILLIAM D. BRIDGES

DATE: NOVEMBER 6, 1967

LOCATION: PARSIPPANY, NEW JERSEY

TIME: 12:25 A.M.

On the night of November 6, 1967, at approximately 12:25 A.M., I received a call from Mrs. Jane Smith, who reported seeing a bright, elliptical-shaped object in the sky over her home in Parsippany, New Jersey.

I immediately responded to the scene and interviewed Mrs. Smith. She stated that she had been looking out her bedroom window when she noticed a bright, glowing object in the sky. The object appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was moving in a steady, level flight path. Mrs. Smith stated that the object had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound.

I was able to observe the object for several minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object.

This incident has been recorded in the Project Blue Book files as case number 12125.
