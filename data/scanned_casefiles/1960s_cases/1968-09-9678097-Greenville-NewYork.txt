One night about 11:00 P.M. I went out with my telescope to study the moon. It was a cloudless sky. I was standing right by our storage looking at the moon, which was in the south-western part of the sky.

Out of the corner of my eye an object appeared in the south, out of nowhere. I looked to it. Then I merely stopped. We have this relay tower about a quarter of a mile from our home. It was built the summer of 67. About 50 to 100 feet above and to the right of it and a quarter from me was a space ship.

The thing was around the length of a large size jet. Its shape was that of a flat-top pad triangle. It was a solid silver. Nothing hazy or fuzzy. It had no glow what so ever. It had four blinking yellow lights on the bottom. I looked at it through my telescope and I saw at that two view-able moon the top. I watched.

Here is the text from the document:

it for at least a half an hour, making the
time near 11:30 P.M.
since it drew, I made a sketch of it, in
vocation in preparation to file down and to
me. I can pretty sure that I am the only one
to see it, as the people who live near, are
either old or farmers and go to bed early.
it made no sound and I saw no vapor
come from it. it was motionless so it seemed
to me.

I looked down for a moment and when
I looked up again, it was gone.

I have the drawing home with me. If
in to large for send through in the mail.
off you would care to see it, you may.
Thank you.

Sincerely Yours,

OOT 16 1963

Dear Mi[redacted]

This replies to your recent letter in which you reported that you had seen an unidentified aerial object.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire mailed in this envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate.

Should you ever sight another such object, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has an investigator of unidentified flying objects (UFO's). He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AICMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil
