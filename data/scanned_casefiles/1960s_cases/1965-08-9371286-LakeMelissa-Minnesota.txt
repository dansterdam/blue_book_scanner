Dear Mr. ____,

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you were unable to identify on the night of August 30, 1965.

A check of the satellite schedules indicates that the object you observed was probably SATI ID JOHN-15 which was passing over the area at 9:12 PM at 67 degrees elevation moving northeast on that date.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING, 30 AUG 65
TO: Hq USAF SAFOICO (Mrs Hunt) 
WASH D C 20330

Mrs. G... of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, reported a UFO observation on 30 Aug 65 at 9:52 pm CST. The object assembled a star comparable in magnitude to the planet Venus. It appeared to be motionless through about 5 degrees across the sky from the North Star and the object disappeared behind tall trees. The closest approach was estimated to be about 3 miles and the altitude estimated to be from 1 degree to 1 1/2 degrees.

The angular rate of about 1 degree per minute is probably underestimated since the position of the object may have been changing in elevation as well as azimuth. The data is characteristic of a satellite. The satellite echo it has a maximum reported altitude of 2780 km over the area at 21:52z. This satellite was over the area at the time and is characteristic in description of a satellite, and coincides with this was the object which was observed.

THE UNDERSIGNED, BEING DULY SWORN, DEPOSES AND SAYS:

On August 9, 1965, at approximately 10:30 P.M., I, along with two other people, saw a bright light in the sky flying north to south at a very high speed. The light was visible for approximately 30 seconds. It was not an airplane or satellite, nor a helicopter, as it was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. I would estimate the speed to be at least 1,000 miles per hour. The light was several times brighter than any star or planet and left no trail or sound. It simply disappeared from sight.
I have no explanation for what we saw but it was definitely not an ordinary aircraft. I have seen many planes and satellites in the sky but this was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was too fast and too bright to be anything I am familiar with.
The incident took place on the north side of Lake Melissa near the town of Audubon, Minnesota.
