SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 30 Aug 65

TO: Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs Hunt)
Wash D C 20330

Mr _______ of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, reported a UFO observation on the night of August 30 at about 9:20 pm CST. The object resembled a star comparable in magnitude to the planet Venus.

Mr _______ stated that the object moved through about 5 degrees of arc in five minutes. The initial sighting was adjacent to the North Star and the object disappeared behind tall trees. The plane Venus has a stellar magnitude of -3.4 and Polaris was at about 47 degrees elevation at the time of the sighting. A speed of 1 degree per minute is probably underestimated since the position of the object at initial observation and disappearance indicates that the object passed through more than 5 degrees of arc. The satellite Echo II has a maximum reported stellar magnitude of -2.0. This satellite was over the area at 9:12 pm at 67 degrees elevation moving Northwest. Since the sighting is characteristic in description of a satellite, and Echo II was over the area, we believe that this was the object observed.

WEST MELISSA DRIVE
DETROIT LAKES, MINNESOTA

August 1965

Subject: UFO Sighting
Location: North Shore, Lake Melissa

On the night of August 30 at about 12:20 PM, (9:20 CST) I was looking northwest and had just located the Big Dipper. Suddenly, and without warning, a bright object appeared. The flight and motion were quite rapid. I could tell that it was not a natural occurrence. It did not appear to be a meteor or aircraft. My wife also saw it come out of our house and observe it as well.
