REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TA-3                                                18 January 1961

SUBJECT: UFOs

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB, 
Texas on 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 January. Not all of these sightings 
were related.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren R. Aiken and 
Major Donald P. Taylor as they proceeded from the area of Altus AFB, 
Oklahoma to Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Atch #1). Majors Aiken and Taylor 
appear to be highly reliable sources. Major Aiken has had much experien-
ce in investigating UFOs, so his conclusion, that he object probably 
was probably a meteorite or a piece of rocket or satellite entering the 
earth on an orbital path, appears to be sound. No other sightings of 
this object were reported.

3. Reference my message of 13 January TA1702A concerning 10 January 
sighting. Many ground sightings correlate highly in the description 
and the path of the object sighted by Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] in 
the aircraft (see Atch #2 and #3); but, since these reports were 
received by the office of local news media, the preparing officer 
was able to obtain only two witnesses' names. The testimony obtained 
from these witnesses who so considered reliable, verifies unquestionably the description and path of the object sighted from the aircraft 
(see Atch #4). The cause and identity of this object remain undeterminable.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs. [redacted] whose 
judgment and reliability seem questionable. It is significant that 
this sighting took place on the day that the local paper headlined the 
10 January sightings. Mrs. [redacted] seemed overly insistent that she 
saw this strange object (see Atch #5) and she described it as "cigar 
shaped," the much-used description for UFOs. She left the sighting 
momentarily to get her husband to see the object, and when they observed 
the sky together neither one saw the object. Further, no other persons 
reported seeing this object, with seems unlikely if it hovered in the 
sky for 30 minutes only a few miles away. It is the preparing officer's 
conclusion that the object was an illusion, or that Mrs. [redacted] was 
seeking publicity.

5. Mr. [redacted] programmer and weatherman for KFDX-TV, Wichita 
Falls, reported that he saw an extremely bright object in the southwest as he drove from Munday, Oklahoma to Frederick, Oklahoma (see


- page 16 -

Atch (#6). Mr. [redacted] Judgement and reliability seem high. There were no other reported sightings of this object. The preparing officer is unable to estimate the cause or identity of this object.

6. On 15 January from approximately 0315Z to approximately 0330Z Mr. [redacted] and other employees of KFDX-TV sighted from the station, on the southwest end of Wichita Falls, an object at about 250 and 100 from the horizon. The object appeared the same as the one sighted 14 January (see Atch /6), except that it did not emit a glow at intervals. The preparing officer is unable to determine the cause or identity of the object.
