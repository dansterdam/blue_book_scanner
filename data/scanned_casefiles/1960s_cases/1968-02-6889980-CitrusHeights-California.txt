NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   9   March   1968

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object moved toward the east. It flashed on and off all the time I saw it. Then that fin appeared. I also noticed that when ever a spotlight (much lower than object) crossed below it, it sublimated a dull blue. After it passed back it resumed bright white.

I am not saying this was a flying saucer, because I live near an air force base, but the never seen a plane that did not have red, white, and blue lights outlining the wings.
