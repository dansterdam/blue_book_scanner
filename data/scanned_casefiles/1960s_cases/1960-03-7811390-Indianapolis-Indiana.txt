10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Comet-shaped object, looked like a series of balls. About the size of a lima bean. Color about the same as a star, more gold than blue. A light would blink on and off. First seen in WNW, going W, turned and went SE, going up and down. Disappeared by just blinking out.

11. COMMENTS
It is quite probable that the witnesses observed a reflected or refracted light, which was further distorted by a window screen. However, in the absence of more positive information this case is categorized "unidentified."

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT RECEIVED AT 2653RD AIR RES CENTER

The following is a summary of a statement made by Mrs. [redacted] Indianapolis 8, Indiana, reporting an unidentified flying object:

"This happened about 3:35 in the morning of 23 March 1960. I awakened with a sore throat and got out of bed to gargle when I saw this thing out of my window. It would have been in the west-northwest section of the sky. It flew in quite an arc. First saw it, it was going in a westerly direction and thought it was a star going under a cloud. A light would blink on and off. It was approximately 50° above the horizon. It was as brilliant as a star, but not a glittery brilliance. It looked like a lot of things nestled together. It flew back and forth. After it went west, it turned and went east. It would go up and down. There were no clouds, clear sky and stars were bright. I got my husband out of bed and we both watched it for approximately one minute. It was kind of like a comet shape."

The following is a summary of a statement by Mr. [redacted]

"My wife is quite a believer in these flying objects and I have been quite a pessimist until I saw this. Description of the object: The closest I could come to the description, it was like an old fashioned kite. It looked like it had bars instead of being solid, more like a series of balls. It was more or the size of a lima bean. It appeared to be quite a distance away. The color was about the same as a star, more gold than blue. Appeared to be just one. It had somewhat the contour of an old fashioned kite. Saw nothing like an exhaust or trail. Description of course: As I looked out the window, looking north, it swung through an arc about 90° just above the horizon in a matter of a few seconds. Who called your attention to it: My wife called my attention to it. No reflection on the glass. It moved in a horizontal line and then it went vertically. It reversed through an angle of about 30°. As I stood and looked out the window I could look straight at it. It moved straight across from right to left through an arc of about 90° and suddenly stopped. It disappeared for a few seconds and then went back into the direction that it had come. It was eventually disappeared. It just blanked out. How long was it visible? Saw it about 3/4 of a minute. Did you have optical aid? No optical aid. Time and weather condition? Quarter to four, night time, clear and cold. When first saw it, it was north then northwest."
