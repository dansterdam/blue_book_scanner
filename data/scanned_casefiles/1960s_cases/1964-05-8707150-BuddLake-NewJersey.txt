JUN 11 1964

Dear [redacted]

The Office of the President has asked the Air Force to reply to your recent letter, which you reported seeing an unusual object in the sky over Budd Lake, New Jersey.

The object you saw on both May 23rd and May 24th was ECHO-I. This satellite was over your vicinity on May 23rd at 10:05 p.m. and on May 24th at 10:15 p.m. moving southeast, and on both passes at 500 above the horizon moving southeast.

We are enclosing a brochure on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects which we think will be of interest to you. Included is a brief summary on the Air Force report for investigation and evaluation of UFO sightings, plus statistics for the past 16 years on those reports which have been evaluated. Our special interest is the bibliography which lists several books pertinent to the subject.

Thank you for writing and bringing this sighting to the Air Force. We hope the enclosed brochure will aid in understanding the UFO program with respect to unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

G. R. CARLSON
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Public Information Division
