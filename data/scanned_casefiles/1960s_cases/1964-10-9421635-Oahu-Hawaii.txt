                                            DATE OF REPORT 23 October 1964

SUBJECT:    UFO REPORT
LOCATION:   Oahu, Hawaii                    DATE: 4 October 1964

PHOTOGRAPHY:
                                            QUALITY: Good
FILM:       Two photos lettered A and B and a strip of corresponding negatives. Camera - Kodak Brownie 127

1. PURPOSE: This report answers MO #64-95 from Major Quintanilla (TDSW), who requested evaluation of photography of possible UFO's taken at Karona Beach Park, Oahu, Hawaii.

2. ANALYSIS: Images on photographs A, B, and negatives are resultant to gouges in the film emulsion. The gouges are estimated to be 6 to 7 microns deep by a photo lab technician, and occurred during film processing.

3. This conclusion is basically in concurrence with the preliminary analysis performed by Captain J. M. Mills, Director of Intelligence, PACAFBASCO/326 ADD.

1. Attached are two (2) Kodacolor prints and negatives
   showing possible UFO's.

   is located just north of the extreme eastern end of the
   island of Oahu. The reporting party noticed no unusual
   visual or sound phenomena during the time the pictures
   were being taken. They were not aware of a possible
   UFO until the pictures came back from the processors.
   There were no other reports of unusual phenomena on that
   date.

3. Both photographs were taken within one minute of
   each other. Picture "A" is looking north west along the
   shore. Picture "B" faces the other direction south east
   towards Makapuu Head. The object in picture "A" could
   be almost directly over Kaneohe Marine Air Station. Dir-
   ection of movement of object in picture "B" is from the
   north to south hemispheres.

4. The negatives and pictures were processed locally
   by Technicolor representatives. There were no spots on
   the other negatives or pictures of this film.
