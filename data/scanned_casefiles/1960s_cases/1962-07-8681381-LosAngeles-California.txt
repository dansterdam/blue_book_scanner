SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects

To: Commander
    146th ANG(G)
    Van Nuys, California

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2, subj: UFO, dtd 14 Sep 59 and AFR 200-2A, subj: UFO, dtd 2 Feb 60, the following information is submitted.

2. On 12 July 1962, Mrs [redacted] Avenue, North Hollywood, California, reported to the Federal Aviation Agency that she had seen two unidentified flying objects. The information in this report was determined from her statements.

a. Description of Objects:
   (1) She described the objects as being in the shape of a high yo-yo.
   (2) The objects were of sufficient size to carry 40 to 50 passengers.
   (3) The objects were observed at night, no color was determinable.
   (4) There were two objects observed.
   (5) The objects were observed individually.
   (6) The objects displayed flashing lights which flashed at approximately the same frequency as a flares light, except that gave much brighter.
   (7) The objects discovered almost opposite to the direction of flight.
   (8) She stated that from the sound of the objects, they were engine different than that made by a helicopter, but the sound was quite different from that made by a propeller driven aircraft.

b. Description of Course of Objects:
   (1) Her attention was called to the objects by the sound.
   (2) The objects were approximately 1000 feet in altitude, azimuth not reported.
   (3) The objects were headed west, in the first case circling in a counter clockwise direction, in the second instance in a clockwise direction. At the other time observed, approximately 20 to 30 seconds.
   (4) It was not reported in what direction or manner the objects disappeared.
   (5) The total time of visibility of each object was not reported.

c. Manner of Observation:
   (1) It was a ground-visual observation with no optical aids used.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) Observations were made on 13 July 1962 at 0420 and 0445 Zulu.
(2) The observations were made at night.

e. Location of Observer:
(1) 34-10N 118-15W, approximately four miles southwest of Lockheed Air Terminal.

f. Identifying Information on Observers:
(1) Mrs. [redacted] North Hollywood, California; Housewife.
(2) The observations were confirmed by her husband, age 48 and her daughter, age 19.
(3) Mrs. [redacted] was reported by the FAA examiner to be a rational, intelligent observer.

g. Weather and Winds:
(1) Clear with 15 miles visibility, winds on surface were southeast at 5 knots.

h. Conclusions:
(1) We were unable to contact [redacted] personally for the FAA examiner who forwarded the report. The Lockheed Air Terminal reported no unusual sightings at the time of the observation. There were no photographs or other physical evidence presented. Therefore, we are unable to make any conclusions as to the cause of the nature of the objects.
