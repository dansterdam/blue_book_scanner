    The observer sighted 4 flaming balls the color of flares. The objects were first seen in the NNE. They were traveling in a southerly direction and disappeared almost due north from the observer.

[Several lines are blacked out/redacted]

...at the altitude/time...
...which I sighted four flaming balls
which I thought was a glare on
fire.

It was in the sky and seemed
to be in a landing pattern. It all
to swirl and she saw it also.

A few seconds before it would
have crashed or landed, it seemed to
come out and disappear.
This took place at 8:35 and the
I lasted only a few seconds.

with you and will be happy
