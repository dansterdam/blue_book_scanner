10. CONCLUSION
Astro (Capella) Very likely Igt

On 4 June, Capella was at an azimuth of 335° and an elevation of 8°.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted star like object in the northern sky. Object had slight movement toward the east during observation. Flashing lights were observed; from time to time. One observer stated object could have been an exceptionally bright star. Considering the hazy conditions at the time viewing Capella at the low elevation could have caused the flashing and slight movement.

RADAR SITE APPROX. 15 MILES SOUTH OF BAKER REQUESTING THAT HE ATTEMPT TO MAKE A VISUAL SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT THAT THEY HAD RADAR CONTACT WITH. I WENT OUT SIDE WITH THE RADIO OPERATOR AND WE BOTH OBSERVED THE OBJECT. THE RADIO OPERATOR RETURNED TO THE TELEPHONE AND HAD A SHORT CONVERSATION WITH THE MAN AT THE RADAR SITE, THEN CAME BACK OUTSIDE AND CONTINUED OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT. AT ONE POINT I WENT INTO THE OFFICE AND GOT MY BINOCULARS FROM MY LOCKER AND RETURNED OUTSIDE BOTH MYSELF & THE RADIO OPERATOR USED THE BINOCULARS. AT 11:00 PM I DISCONTINUED OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT AND WENT HOME AND DIDN'T OBSERVE THE OBJECT AGAIN.
