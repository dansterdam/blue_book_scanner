Astro (Capella) very bright at an azimuth of 335° and an elevation of 35°.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted star like object in the northern sky. Object appeared to hover or maintain its position for about 30 minutes. Flashing lights were observed from time to time. Observers stated object could have been an exceptionally bright star. Considering the hazy conditions at the time the low elevation could have caused the flashing and slight movement.

AT 10:15 PM 4 JUNE 1966, WHILE JUST COMING OFF THE SHIFT, AT THE RADIO OPERATOR RE-LIEVED A CLAIM FRAM THE BAKER MUNICIPAL AIRPORT THAT A VISUAL SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT THAT WAS EST. AT ABOUT 15 MILES SOUTH OF BAKER, AND MOVING FAST. THE RADIO OPERATOR OBSERVED THE OBJECT FROM THE RADIO SHACK WINDOW, AND WENT OUT WITH TWO OTHER TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT CONTINUED TO BE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES, THEN IT GAINED ALTITUDE AND WENT AWAY AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE OBJECT WAS THAT IT WAS TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE, LUMINOUS, NO SOUND, AND CHANGED DIRECTIONS RAPIDLY. I CONTINUED OBSERVATIONS OF THE OBJECT AS LONG AS IT REMAINED VISIBLE, WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 2 MINUTES. THE OBJECT DID NOT REMAIN LONG ENOUGH FOR BINOCULARS OR CAMERA TO BE USED. THE OBJECT MADE NO SOUND, THERE WERE NO EXHAUST LIGHTS, AND IT DISAPPEARED AT A VERY RAPID RATE OF SPEED.
