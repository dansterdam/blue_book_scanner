Flash Over Gulf Thought Meteor

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Air Force said Friday that an Air Force plane had reported sighting of a brilliant object in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico Thursday night, but the plane's crew suggested that it may have been a meteor.

However, it said a routine "unidentified flying object" report was sent to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for further study.

A spokesman said Air Force able information. An Air Force spokesman said this is the customary procedure in the handling of all such reports.

Gentlemen:

In connection with the article attached relative to the brilliant object sighted Thursday night, June 23rd, I would like to relate details as follows for whatever value can be gleaned therefrom:

"I was driving alone from Breaux Bridge, La., toward Parks, La., and at a point about five miles out of Breaux Bridge, while headed in a Southeasterly direction at approximately 10:20 P.M., I sighted what appeared like a comet with a tail falling straight down and dead ahead. It was somewhat of a tear-drop shaped object but with little or no taper. I first saw it through the top of my windshield and outside it appeared bluish-green but after it cleared the tinted part, it appeared brilliant and whitish. My guess is that I could see at about a 30 degree angle from horizon to top of windshield and that I saw the object falling for about half this distance. The first head part of it appeared to bog down, from which a second head part fell with tail similar to first part. Other than that it looked a bit different, I presume it was a meteor, which as always appears to be only five or ten miles away."

Yours very truly

(Ex Captain Air Transport
Command)
