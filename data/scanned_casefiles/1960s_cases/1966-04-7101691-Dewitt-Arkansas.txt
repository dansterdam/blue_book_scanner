North Little Rock Arkansas
May 25, 1965

Gentlemen:

I would like to report the tentative sighting of a flying unidentified object at approximately 4:45 the morning of April 25, 1966, near DeWitt, Arkansas. 

We were returning from a business trip to Little Rock. Arkansas. At approximately 4:45 and 5:00 p.m. the object appeared to be stationary, and it remained in our sight for several minutes, at least 5 to 10 minutes. The object was visible to both of us.

It appeared to be at an elevation of approximately 45 to 50 degrees and a distance of approximately 3 to 5 miles. The color was very brilliant and appeared to be light in color, yellowish-white. It was not the size of a star or planet, and did not appear to have wings or any other appendages. It remained stationary the entire time we observed it. 

We were on our way to Leaque Bayou for a duck hunting trip, and were about 2 miles east of DeWitt, Arkansas. Driving southbound on U.S. 165 at the time of the same observations. 

The clouds in the sky at the time were cirrostratus, and we suppose the clouds were cirrostratus, but complexly thin, but complete. Strangely enough, it looked as if there was a break in the clouds between the ground and the object. The cloud cover was very high, and the haze was very dense between the ground and the clouds. Later on, when we noticed it again, the main body of the cloud coverage had broken up beyond the clouds. It was then that we noticed it again.

The main body of the cloud coverage had broken up beyond the clouds. Later on, when we noticed it again, it was blocked by a smaller separate cloud. The main body of the cloud coverage had broken up beyond the clouds.

The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a typed document that describes a UFO sighting.

It was bright like a star or a light, but too large to be a star. The object was strong and steady. After the sun rose it did not seem as strong and steady. The object seemed to be lower down than the light reflected by Venus. The object appears to have some coverage behind it, so I probably would have dismissed it unusually bright stars or planets.

Presently on duty in the Navy on the a, however. I live in North Little Rock ail would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about this incident. But please do not publish this report of information. I have taken the liberty of reporting this incident to justify reporting it.
