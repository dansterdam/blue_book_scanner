Waynesburg, Pa.
19 July 1962

United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

On 18 July 1962, at about 10:30 PM EST, at Camp Carmel near Dunbar, Fayette County, Pa., I sighted what I believe were two "unidentified flying objects". Rather than belabor you with details in this letter, I have compiled the information in the form of your "U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" which apparently applies to such unidentified objects.

Kindly find this information.

This matter may already have been the subject of official interest to your organization, for about fifteen minutes after the objects disappeared, one or more jet planes appeared, apparently insearch of the objects.

Perhaps I should mention that I am not a member of any organization attempting to find or prove the existence of unidentified flying objects.

If you are interested in this matter, and wish further information, naturally I should be most pleased to oblige.

[Signature is blacked out]

b. Color Blue and white through the binoculars just white with my eyeglasses on.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails of vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Q?: Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object of objects made.
Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path,
and show any changes in direction during the course.

[A hand-drawn diagram showing a curved path with letters A, N, W, B, E marked]

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object
was in its longest dimension.
700 feet (just a guess)

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of
the following objects held in § the hand.
Head of a pin

22.1 Certain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
One disappeared behind some trees and the other disappeared in the fog
that was forming at that time.

24. In order that you can give a clear picture of what you saw, we would
like you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of
what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape
would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which
when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which
you saw.
Material -- It had a silvery metallic surface which emitted light.
How large -- 700 feet in diameter, perhaps a little less.
Shape -- a thick disc, like a watch. The edges were somewhat thinner
than the center.
Common object: can't think of anything.

25. Where were you located when you saw the object? Outdoors.

26. I was in open countryside.

27. What were you doing at the time you saw the object, and how did you happen
to notice it?
I was observing stars, as a hobby. Then I saw these stars which were
moving.

28. If you were moving in an automobile or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions:
(I was not moving in an automobile.)

29. What direction were you looking when you first saw the object?
North

30. What direction were you looking when you last saw the object?
East

31. If you are familiar with bearing terms (angular direction), try to estimate the number of degrees the object was from true North and also the number of degrees it was upward from the horizon (elevation).

31.1 When it first appeared:
"First" object: a. From true North 5 degrees west.
                b. From horizon 35 degrees

"second" object: a. From true North 50 degrees West.
                 b. From horizon 35 degrees

31.2 When it disappeared:
"First" object: a. From true North 50 degrees East
                b. From horizon 30 degrees

"second" object - I was too busy observing the first object to observe the disappearance of the second.

The first object appeared in the northerly end of Draco, proceeded southward along Draco into Hercules, gradually curving Eastward toward Lyra. At Lyra it made a tight circle - a very tight circle - and proceeded eastward through Cygnus and into Pegasus where it disappeared.(in the gathering fog).

The second object appeared in Coma Berenices and proceeded through Bootes. At this time I ran to get my binoculars, and my further impressions of this object are quite hazy.

32, 33. See question 31.

34. What were the weather conditions at the time you saw the object?

34.1 Clouds:
Hazy

34.2 Wind
No wind

34.3 Weather:
Light fog starting to form
Clear overhead where most
observations were made.

34.4 Temperature
Cool.

35. When did you report to some official that you had seen the object.
I have made no such report.

36. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
No.


- page 6 -

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
Yes.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I have no ideas.

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
No, not in miles per hour, since I have no impression of the altitude. In angular velocity the objects were traveling just a little slower than the jet plane or planes which appeared about fifteen minutes later.

I should like to emphasize that during the first minute of my observation object #1 caused a sound, the source of which seemed to originate about 45 degrees in front of the object. This relative angular difference was maintained during the flight of the first minute. At that time I went in to get my binoculars, and when I came back there was no more sound.

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
No.

41. Please give the following information about yourself:
Name:
Address: [redacted], Waynesburg, Pa.
Telephone Waynesburg
What is your present job: Camp counsellor. College student in fall.
Age 20.     Sex Male.

Please indicate any special educational training you have had.
Grade school Yes.
High school Yes.
College 1 year.
Other special training: Astronomy.

42. Date you completed this questionnaire.  19 July 1962.
