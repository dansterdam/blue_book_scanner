Dear Mr. --- 

This is in response to your recent letter in connection with an unidentified flying object sighted in the Lakeland, Florida, area on August 10, 1964.

You requested additional information concerning the matter. While I do not have a great deal of data to impart, I am enclosing a copy of the report which was submitted by the observer.

Thank you for reporting this to us. It will be of value to our continuing study and investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena.

Dear Sir,

I have 30 years off experience in the field of electrical engineering. I was working on a project which involved the construction of a device that was capable of affecting the functioning of electrical systems over a considerable distance, as an experiment rather than with any specific purpose in mind. On the evening of August 8, 1964, I was working on this device in my laboratory in Lakeland, Florida, when I observed some strange lights in the sky.

I do not know exactly what I saw, but the phenomenon was quite remarkable. The lights appeared to move in an erratic manner and to change direction abruptly. At one point, they seemed to pause in mid-air before accelerating rapidly. I would be most interested to know if anyone else in the area observed this event and if the Air Force or other agencies have any information regarding it.

I am enclosing a sketch of what I observed, although I realize that it may not be entirely accurate. I would be grateful if you could let me know if this incident was reported to your organization and if there is any further information available.

Yours sincerely,
