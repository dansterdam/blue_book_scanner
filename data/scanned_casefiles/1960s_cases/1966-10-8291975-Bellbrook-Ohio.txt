The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present on this particular page. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. Vanished into mountain.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    YES    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
