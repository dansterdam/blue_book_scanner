[Lower body of document text is partially legible, with some words/phrases discernible but not complete sentences]

There is also a handwritten notation on the right side of the document that appears to read "37 4-22" with some additional markings.

Some text is illegible or partially obscured, so I have only reported the text I can confidently read.
