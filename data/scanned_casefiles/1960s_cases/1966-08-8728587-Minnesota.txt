XIII. Miscellaneous Comments of Observer

The object paralleled their course west on highway 34. They turned north to get away, went into the Twin Pines Resort, and came out again with All three then watched the object until about 0400Z when it went behind the trees. Their car window were down, and no sound was heard. They also thought the object expanded vertically, "like a balloon being inflated."

Earlier Sightings in the Area

Mr. [redacted] said his mother, Mrs. [redacted] and two companions, Mrs. [redacted] and [redacted], saw an identical object that same evening between 0430Z and 0530Z. They were entering their home in Walker after a party, but described the women as "conservative" and said, "None of them drank." They described the object as soundless and said it proceeded northeast for two or three minutes before they lost sight of it.

Mr. [redacted] said that about 0400Z, 9 Aug 66, he and 16 other people, including two Minnesota highway patrolmen, saw a sky going northeast, executing several abrupt right angle turns as it did so. This was observed from in front of his next door neighbor's home. The next evening, between 0315Z and 0330Z, he and his next door neighbor, who was said the "county commissioner," observed an identical object on an identical course. Mr. [redacted] said both evenings were clear and still, which raises the possibility of inversions, on which this office has no data. Mr. [redacted] said a surveyor was present, and admittedly very rough estimates of the object's velocity at 3500 miles per hour. However, the object was large enough or low enough to have a round shape, and no sonic boom was heard. The object's size was about one-third that of a high, full moon.

Additional Comments

This office called the St. Louis County Attorney's office, located in Duluth, Minnesota, and one [redacted] in their directory as [redacted] for [redacted] County. They did not have his office telephone number. It would, therefore, seem probable that the man who reported the sightings was, in fact, the [redacted].

1. The attached reports have been submitted in letter form in an attempt to be as complete as possible. Some of the reports came into this office via secondhand and were chased down necessarily via phone calls and, of course, much clerical work using borrowed stenographers. There is no physical evidence of any sort to substantiate the sightings; however, the reports generally came from reliable sources, and the writer feels, especially in the case of _______ and unsettled them.

2. The article from the local paper indicates the coverage given some of these sightings. The story as written in the press has a couple of variations from that told this office, i.e., the second observation was more of a glow behind the trees that did get brighter for a while as they passed and then died out. It lasted approximately 2 minutes as they drove by. The other item was the steering up of the car windows - there were four people in the car, all getting quite excited, and the local relative humidity was standing at 85% on a warm, muggy night.

3. The 00002 Radiosonde Balloon from St. Cloud, Minnesota, gave the following temperature readings for the area:

SFC   - +29째C
3,000' - +20째C
5,000' - +17째C
10,000' - +10째C
15,000' - -5째C
20,000' - -11째C
25,000' - -28째C
30,000' - -36째C
35,000' - -50째C

The winds were reported to be from approximately 225째 @ 20K from sfc to 10,000'. Then they swung around to 270째 @ 30K

a. Sound - Unable to determine as I was flying an aircraft
b. Color - Little perimeter Bright/Greenish - changed to gray

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how
much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the
sighting, how much would have been covered by the match head?
Only a small fraction

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details
of the object such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.

31 August 66

Conversation with Mr. Chamberman, FAA (551-1560) ex-8700) said he received his radar contact information from the Chicago center. Radar contact was noted of an unidentified object over the Milwaukee area. Mr. Chamberman gave his information to Lt. Howe for the report from Truax Field.

Conversation with Mr. Irwin, Chief Controller, Chicago Center, (397-2061) failed to pinpoint any observance of an unidentified object on their radar scopes about 03552 17 August 66. Mr. Irwin checked with those persons on duty and the records. He suggested I contact the Milwaukee sector and see if they had anything unidentified on their scopes.

Contact was made with Lt. Howe (551-1560) Truax Field. He said that it could have been an aircraft. The Chicago center only tracks certain aircraft, the ones that file IFR, Balloons, private aircraft, etc., are not tracked by Chicago center. These type of objects would appear unknown on the radar scopes at the Chicago center.

2 Sept. 66

Conversation with Mr. Chamberman, Truax Field, He said to call Milwaukee sector (Mr. Bukman) about the sighting. He (Mr. Chamberman) said he had gotten his information from the Chicago Center. Note- Mr. Irwin, Chicago Center, reported negative radar contact with UFO on or about 03552 17 August 66.

6 Sept. 66

Called Milwaukee sector for a Mr. Bukman. They knew of no such man. Milwaukee sector said that if there was anything unidentified on their scopes they would know of it, they knew nothing. No one knew of anything being reported unidentified on their scopes.

Mr. Bukman's alleged number is 414/748/220.

19 Sept. 66

Contact with Mr. McVay, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland regarding the observance of UFOs over northern Minn. Requested information on Barium Cloud Releases at Fort Churchill, Canada.

On 16 August 66 the Germans were participating in several experiments over the Fort Churchill area. At 2239 CDT there was a rocket that departed Fort Churchill and reached an altitude of about 247 statute miles. Started with a brilliant red color then to violet and finally to a greenish-blue. The phenomena could have been visible for up to one hour depending on the altitude of the sighting.

XII. Physical Evidence
A. No photos. They did not develop.
B. No material evidence.

Additional Comments

Just before sunrise, a fairly pronounced temperature inversion developed over much of Minnesota. It is the opinion of division weather officers that no significant inversion would likely at the time of the sightings. All of the sightings were near, but never over, lakes. A fact not in itself significant in view of the large number of lakes in this area. The weather officers believe the lakes would tend to destroy or weaken any existing inversions, because the preceding day was warm and clear, and the lakes would absorb and release heat at night. Of further interest, is the fact that this sighting resembles many over Arizona and New Mexico in the early 1950's - the "exploding green fireball".

Request for UFO Information and Sighting,

Hq USAF (SAFOI0C)                                 SEP 2 7 1966

Reference the attached letter from _______ providing
information on unidentified flying objects. The following is a
suggested reply to his letter.

a. Dear _______

It was most interesting to learn your views on probable
causes of some unidentified flying object reports. We feel that
many such observations are merely a result of abnormal atmos-
pheric conditions. Such an abnormal atmospheric condition could
have occurred the night of 16 August 1966, however, we do not
believe this to be the primary cause of your observation.

After conferring with the Goddard Space Flight Center,
Greenbelt, Maryland, we were informed that on that particular night
a rocket was launched from Fort Churchill, Canada at 2239 CDT. This
rocket reached an altitude of approximately 247 miles; at a some-
what lower altitude there was a barium cloud release. The colors
must have been quite lovely as they began with a brilliant red
color which changed to a violet followed by and ending with a
greenish - blue. We were also informed that the cloud release was
visible in parts of Minnesota. This was later confirmed by
various tracking stations such as Fort Churchill.

The Air Force received several reports from the Minnesota
area regarding the observation which you refer to. After careful
investigation our analysis feel that the particular research pro-
gram which we mentioned was responsible for the various observations.

We wish to thank you for your interest in the UFO program
and appreciated hearing from you.

Project Blue Book Information Office,
ATIC 751
Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear Sirs: Through the courtesy of the Hon. Albert H. Quie, Representative of the 1st Dist. of Minn., Minnesota, I received from your office some time ago a copy of your Project Blue Book, 1 February 1966, which tells of various phenomena, known as UFO.

It is a well-known fact that these phenomena have caused many citizens to become intensely alert to them and to speculate about the causes of them. I myself have become interested in their possible explanation. I have made 1st page headlines in my papers.

I have also made theories for myself as to the probable actualities which I believe to be entirely electro-magnetic, and on recent instances of fields. I shall use as illustrations two very recent instances of these phenomena, which may be fully made under 1st of these two is described in the Chronicle, Aug 17th edition (which is pending with this letter and you daily). From a low flying (which I am sending with this letter) evening, Aug 17 1/2 PM from my field location. At this time the thermo rise was from 82째 and although this temperature is not successively high it still was extremely uncomfortable. I looked out of the window, and saw a very peculiar phenomenon, perhaps a heat mirage, behind a part object, flying quite low, perhaps a night and partly transparent polished glass. But all parts were batted in extremely unusual colors. Like a transparent polished glass. The colors were built out white and a deep crimson. It was not massed over before. Then for spectacle, one that I have not messed over before, since it was flying low, it was watched because of the trees and buildings. It was headed into the airport. My phenomenon at this same time was flying low, it was caused by extraordinary atmospheric electric light was caused whatever it was, rushing through an interstellar electric or magnetic charge at atmospheric. The flying object on the side of the carrier forcades moves with, not west, somewhat and electric phenomena seen.

The unusual part of my sighting was electric phenomena seen on Tuesday night, August 16th in the sky and mine were 20 miles...

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

we have conditions in the air that the witnesses observed
objects like trucks, cars, trains, or can't it anything with lights, this
air assume for altitude, shaped, and unbelievable to life. It can
be in a train if you're quite that would be reasonable in this
statement. If the phone message can show that I can't hear
the trouble before the time of day coming to about
little after 10:00 (10:30) but I believe with nearly all of them
there is something to know yet and understand. Among this, your report, Project
Blue Book, and what might help to draw from glow being and very
new reports will be welcome. Very Sincerely Yours,

Flood of UFO
Reports in State
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS    Unidentified flying objects, variously reported as bright green, red, bright blue and bluish-green, were reported in Minnesota overnight.

Employes in the control tower at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport reported sighting "an object." Twin Cities radio stations received about 15 calls from persons who reported sighting the "whatever."

At the Flying Cloud Airport southwest of Minneapolis, several pilots reported noting an object. They said it settled down on an east-west runway and then zoomed up and away.

Reports of UFOs also came from areas near Crystal, Coon Rapids, Waconia, Rochester, Mounds Park and Fensford.

Mrs. Frank Peters, of north Minneapolis, said several persons at her home saw a searchlight beam cast on clouds, "There it was, high in the sky, just poised there," she said. "And then it faded away into nothing."

Donald Steffan of Plymouth, a Minneapolis suburb, said he saw a bluish green UFO "which seemed to have a mind of its own" and the color seemed to be going around.

Several people in the Itasca Park area told the Hubbard County sheriff's office they saw an object two to three feet in diameter 200 feet above ground. It was bright green at first, they said, and then turned red. One caller said the object appeared to be following an eastbound car on Highway 71.

Several persons also reported an object, two to three feet across, over Fensford. It was up about 200 feet, they said, and was bright blue with a trailing blue flame.

UFO SIGHTING, 16 August 1966,

The information submitted has been studied and we feel that [redacted]
observed a barium cloud which was visible throughout the northern part
of the United States on the night of 16 August 1966. His description,
regarding shape, size, color, and motion is consistent with that reported
by various other witnesses in the states of North Dakota, Minnesota
and Wisconsin.

Air Force investigation revealed that various NASA scientists were
participating in several upper atmosphere experiments in the Fort Churchill,
Canada area. At 2239 CDT on 16 August 1966 a rocket, equipped with an
experimental package, was launched from Fort Churchill and reached an
altitude of approximately 250 miles. Shortly before reaching the programmed
altitude, a barium cloud was released into the atmosphere. The attached
news release provides additional information regarding the objective
of this scientific experiment. The Fort Churchill experiment preceded
the Wallops Island experiment, however, they were identical in experimental
objectives.

Dear Paul:

Since replying this enclosed noting of work in your valuable time but I thought you would like to see the most appropriate office or department for proper evolution.

I saw this "thing" last night while flying and stop I do not believe it was an object of reconnaissance by "being" itself a mile of sufficient interest & report. If it was merely connected and if gross path running might it was observed when the edge become it would be nice & one inspection of it. I am not down in the larger & large run but the impression that and I not down in the beat is obscure. I have clearly. Surely will silently draw many & the boys & I are watching here out having a complete time.

The weather has been excellent.
