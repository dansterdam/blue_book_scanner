XIII. - Miscellaneous Comments of Observer
The object paralleled their course west on highway 3. They turned their course towards the east and the object did likewise. While following the object, they watched it until about 0400z when it went behind the trees. This object was round and had red, blue, and green lights on it. Occasionally, sparks like a welder's arc were seen emitting from the object. The object's rate of speed was estimated to be 500 miles per hour. How- ever, the object's size was such a comparison could be made and still only leave an estimate of its speed and not an accurate measurement.

Mr. A.B. said his mother, Mrs. A. Smith, and six companions observed an identical object that same evening between 0330 and 0400z in the western sky. A friend of one of them drank a pop and dropped the bottle, which was described. The object was similar in appearance to the one reported for Mr. and Mrs. C.

Mr. C. said that, about 0002, 9 Aug 66, he and 15 other persons, including his wife, observed a similar type object. They described movement as random with no set pattern, and a speed beyond comparison rate to anything the observer had seen previously. During one brisk, abrupt flight maneuver, the object was observed to stop abruptly and back up.

Additional Comments
This office called the St. Louis County Attorney's office, listed as county in the report, to ascertain if the telephone number of the man who reported the sightings was available. However, there was a traffic while attempting to make contact and the operator suggested calling back at a later time on the same date.

1. The witnesses reports have been submitted in letter form as requested. There have been numerous instances of people coming into this office in person via second-hand and were chased away as crank calls. There was no classical work using borrowed stenographers. There were sightlings and the witnesses seem, especially in the case of the writer, to he quite verbal.

2. The article from the local paper indicates the coverage given there of the incidents. The story as written in the press has a couple of variations from that told this office as possible reason, as they passed the news along to the home office in Washington. They died out approximately 5 minutes as they maneuvered, and the writer seems quite excited, and the local relative humidity was standing at 97% on a warm, muggy night.

3. The 00002 Radiosonde Balloon from St. Cloud, Minnesota, gave the following temperatures for the area:
5,000' - +25°C
10,000' - +10°C
15,000' - -15°C
20,000' - -28°C
25,000' - -36°C
30,000' - -44°C

The winds were reported to be from approximately 225° @ 20K from 5,r to 10,000'. Then they swung around to 270° @ 30K.

After we were about two miles away from the light, it seemed to be flashing, rather than rotating, and getting higher and higher, finally disappearing from view. This light seemed unusually large and bright in comparison to normal aircraft lights. The color was orange or amber, and the flashing was not regular, but variable in rate. I also noticed that it cast a beam of light downward for a considerable distance from itself. The size and shape of the light at this time resembled a searchlight. The light seemed to be suspended from the sky, not attached to anything, and the area around it appeared to have a somewhat hazy or fog like appearance. After it disappeared, no other lights were visible in the area. The direction it took was generally towards the north west and it was visible for around 4 to 5 minutes before going out of sight."

Contact with Mr. McKay, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland
regarding the observance of UFOs over northern Minnesota. Requested
information on German Glider Releases at Fort Churchill, Canada.

On 16 August 66 the Germans were participating in several experimental glider flights over the Churchill area. Between 2255 and 2302 GMT there were a couple of gliders that went out to about 6000 feet altitude, then started with a brilliant red color then to violet and finally to one hour depending on the altitude of the sighting.

XII. Physical Evidence
A: No photos. They did not develop.
No material evidence.

Additional Comments:
Just before sunrise, a fairly pronounced temperature inversion developed over much of Minnesota. This type of inversion results in bending of light rays, much like a mirage, but never reaches the point of optical distortion resulting in an image itself significant [sic] unless a factor of mass or volume of intensity is added. The inversion definitely existed, having been observed and confirmed by competent Weather Bureau personnel over an extensive area. The phenomenon resembles many observations from Arizona and New Mexico in the early 1950's - the applying ground aroma.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows several numbered objects or shapes on what seems to be a horizontal line or surface. The text above the sketch states "Saucer 18 sighted to left view 13 yr old boy in right seat who lies hour 30-40M". This suggests the drawing is an attempt to depict a UFO sighting by a 13-year-old boy.

WRITER /Maj Quintanilla, Jr/70916/h/26 Sep 66
Request for UFO Information and Sightings.

HQ USAF (SAFGDI) SEP 2 7 1966
Reference the attached letter from providing information on unidentified flying objects. The following is a suggested reply to his letter: 

a. It was most interesting to learn your views on probable causes of UFO sightings. As you point out, many such observations are merely a result of abnormal atmospheric conditions. Such an abnormal condition could have occurred the night of 16 August 1966 however, we cannot believe that this alone is the cause of your observation.

After conferring with the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, we find the object you described in your letter is a Rocket reentry observed tracking stations subordinate to Fort Churchill. This rocket reached an altitude of approximately 247 miles; at a time when low level clouds covered the area. This caused a variation in the color which changed to a violet. This was followed by and ending with a diminishing trail.

We wish to thank you for your interest in the UFO program and appreciate the information received from you.

Textual output:

Project Blue Book Information Office,
St. Paul 51, Minnesota, August 25th, 1966.

Hasting[wn], Dd. 20330

This refers to UFO sightings and observations of the town Albert H. Grice, representative of the lst National Mines Co., Inc., Congress Bldg., Washington, D.C., with states that on the evening of
Augusti 25, 1966, around 8:20 p.m., his wife Ruth Grice and other members of his family were sitting outside their home at 216 W. Elm St., Hastings, Minnesota, and that, while sitting there, they noticed a strange light in the sky to the southwest, which they watched for over an hour.

His wife Ruth states that when they first noticed the light it appeared to be round and about the size of a basketball, but that it gradually became larger and elongated, finally taking on a cigar or sausage shape. She states that the light changed color several times, going from a bright white to a dull orange and then back to white again. She says that the light seemed to be hovering or stationary in the sky and remained in the same general area throughout the observation. She states that they watched the light with great interest and that it was a completely clear, cloudless sky at the time.

Mr. Grice's daughter Nancy, age 16, corroborates her mother's story and states that she also saw the strange light in the sky. She says that the light appeared to be solid and not just a reflection, and that it seemed to be metallic in appearance. She states that the light made no sound and that it remained stationary for the entire period of observation.

Mr. Grice himself states that he was on the porch of his home and that he also saw the strange light in the southwestern sky. He says that the light was definitely not an aircraft of any kind, and that it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. He states that the light seemed to be self-luminous and that it did not appear to be reflecting any other light source. He says that the light remained in the same general area throughout the observation and that it did not appear to be moving.

Mr. Grice states that he has been in contact with the Project Blue Book Information Office in an effort to determine what the strange light may have been, and that he is very interested in getting some kind of an explanation for what he and his family observed. He states that he has no theory as to what the light may have been, but that he is convinced that it was not a conventional aircraft or any other known object.

This was the text contained in the document:

in time, using one day, once, so that this might never have. happened. I do not know
 why I was awakened at that time, but it was surely an unusual experience. I have never
 had anything like this happen to me before. The time was about 3:15 AM, August 8. I
 was awakened by a sound, as if something heavy had struck the side of the house. The
 sound was not like a crash, but more of a reverberating thud, with no aftereffect. I im-
mediately went to the living room window and looked out, but I could see nothing unusual
 in the yard or on the street. I did not hear the dogs barking or any other sound that 
might have caused the disturbance. My wife slept on, unaware of the incident.

Going out of the house, I found nothing unusual in the area. The grass and shrubbery were
 all undisturbed. When daylight came, there was still no evidence of any type of landing 
or impact in the yard. During the day I talked with neighbors who live nearby, but no one
 else had heard or seen anything unusual that night.  

I am puzzled by the experience and can offer no explanation for the unusual sound that
 awakened me. It was not like anything I have ever heard before. As I look back on it, I 
wonder if it could have been some type of aerial phenomenon. However, I saw no lights 
or other indications of an aircraft in the area. I can only report what I experienced -
 the sound that awakened me and the lack of any evidence afterwards. I have no other
 information to add to this report. The incident remains a mystery to me.

EXTRACTING TEXT:

4 we have conducted an interview with the witness and obtained the following information:

Miss Lillian
Age - 2

Witness saw an unidentified flying object at approximately 7:00 p.m. on August 18 1966 while driving home alone from work on highway 35 near the town of Forest Lake, Minnesota.

The object was first observed in the northwest sky about 20 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be stationary and was very bright, casting a definite illumination over the area. The object seemed to have a smooth, rounded, metallic appearance.

After observing the object for about 5 minutes, the witness noticed that it suddenly rose vertically and gained altitude rapidly, disappearing from view in about 10 seconds.

The witness appeared to be a reliable and intelligent person. Her story was consistent and she seemed sincere in her description of the incident. The investigator considers her a credible witness.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a newspaper article with the headline "Flood of UFO Reports in State". The article discusses reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) being seen by multiple people across Minnesota, including some sightings near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The article describes the objects as being bright green, red, bright blue, and bluish-green in color. Some objects were reported to change directions or fade away quickly.

FLOOD OF UFO REPORTS IN STATE
BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
"Unidentified flying objects," green, red, bright blue and bluish-green, were reported in Minnesota and western Wisconsin Tuesday night.
Several pilots reported sighting an object near the Twin Cities. They said it seemed to be "solid, with lights" and then it suddenly "faded away."
A resident of Plum City, Wis., about 50 miles from the Twin Cities, also called to report seeing an object that "seemed to approach him and then just disappeared."
At the Flying Cloud Airport southwest of Minneapolis, several persons reported seeing an object that "looked like a satellite and then faded away."
Donald Cramer of Plymouth, a Minneapolis suburb, said he saw a bright, flashing light in the sky that seemed to be "moving around."
"It was brighter than a star and just flashed on and off," he said. "And then it faded away into nothing."

The text of the document states:

UFO SIGHTING, 16 AUGUST 1966

The information submitted has been studied and we feel that it observed a certain cloud which was visible to the northern part of the United States on the night of 16 August 1966. His description, regarding shape, size, color, and motion is consistent with that reported by various other witnesses in the states of North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Air Force investigation revealed that various NASA scientists were participating in several upper atmosphere experiments in the Fort Churchill, Canada area. At 2339 GMT on 15 August 1966 a rocket, equipped with an experimental package, was launched from Fort Churchill and reached an altitude of approximately 230 miles. Shortly before reaching the programmed altitude, a barium cloud was released into the atmosphere. The attached news release provides additional information regarding the objective of this scientific experiment. The Fort Churchill experiment proceeded the Wallops Island experiment; however, they were identical in experimental objectives.

Text from the document:

Dear Paul:
This letter is to end the unusual mention of your interest and my own time and opportunities offered as a potential host for a future visitation.

I was and remain active in trying to determine the authenticity and source of "signs" that have been presented me during past years. The character of any further contacts would be wholly dependent on their intent and purpose in making themselves known to me. Certainly no "flying" or display of mechanical devices would be part of any plan I might initiate.

Many of the boys seem preoccupied with matters I do not fully understand. I am not impressed by claims or stories unless there is good evidence to support them.

Thank you for sending the list of personnel concerned. It will receive my attention.
