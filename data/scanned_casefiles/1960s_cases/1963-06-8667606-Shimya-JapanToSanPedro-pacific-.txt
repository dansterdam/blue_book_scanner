On a passage from Shimya, Japan to San Pedro, California a satellite was sighted as follows:

June 18th C.M.T.
Cleared between south & west
June 18th 11:15 GMT Pos. 39°18'N 175°-E'd
Sighted about 55° Passing between clouds and Pleiades but temp

SATELLITE 1960 DATA 1
FOR GIVEN LATITUDES

The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns showing satellite tracking information, including dates (June 15-21, 1963), latitude, longitude, time, and other numerical measurements. The table is divided into sections for different dates and includes columns for "NORTH-SOUTH" and other measurements. At the bottom right of the page, there are some additional notes about data elements and calculations, but the text is somewhat difficult to read clearly.

The table contains numerous rows of numerical data with precise measurements, seemingly related to satellite tracking or orbital calculations. The dates range from June 15 to June 21, 1963.

The bottom right section contains some text that appears to include information about calculations, periods, and other technical details, but due to the image quality, some of the text is illegible.
