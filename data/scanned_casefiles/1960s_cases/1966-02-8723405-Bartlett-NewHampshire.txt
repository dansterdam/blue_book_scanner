Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
Supplemental Sheet A

4 June 1968

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire.

Three witnesses. Has been evaluated as possible aircraft. Even after a phone call to these people the case remains indeterminate. Mr. and Mrs. _____, New Hampshire, are farm people who are not very articulate when it comes to description of things. However, after two years after the original report, the main outlines of the case remains the same. They say the usual thing in such cases, "I never saw anything like this before" and apparently they haven't seen anything else like this since. There are a few inconistances. In the original report they said that the moon was out and setting in the west, and in the phone conversations they said there was no moon. In fact, now they think it was cloudy, but outside of its being dark they can't be sure.

I originally called because of the reported action of the dog. However, this came to naught since they admitted that the dog had behaved this way before and since. However, they said the dog's actions were similar to those which occur when a dog hears one of these high-pitched dog whistles inaudible to humans. Mr. _____ said the light was very bright, something like a large yard light. He said the duration was about ten minutes, all told. He also stated that the dog whined a lot before the sighting and that he had been uneasy all evening. This, of course, proves nothing. At closest, Mr. _____ thought it was about a quarter of a mile away, just at the edge of his farm. Original sighting was made by Mrs. _____, who woke Mr. _____ up and said, "There is a flying saucer in the yard." This sort of statement occurs quite frequently and indicates how ready people in all walks of life seem to accept the existence of flying saucers and indicate also that they are not too startled when they apparently see one!

As far as evaluation is concerned, present evaluation as "possible aircraft" is one possibility, along with possible unknown. There are no airports within 50 miles according to Mr. Trecartin and a very bright red light, white around the edges, apparently grew brighter and then dimmer over a course of ten minutes without appreciable cross, or tangential, motion hardly fits the description of aircraft, and particularly at that time of night at a place far from an airport. I would be much more inclined to call this possible unknown rather than possible aircraft. It could also be evaluated as insufficient information, because even after my phone call, the actual number of information bits still remains woefully meager.

it occurred at a small airport and the duration was one and one-
half minutes. Followup should have been made to determine
there were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred mid-
night on December 28, it is possible that there were no other
witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified, as a
witness.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.

One witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds. Witness
was a 67 year old lady. Sighting occurred at 9 p.m. day:
saving time in the middle of August, and thus the sky was
still have been reasonably bright. Witness said sighting occurred
at night and sky very blue. Perhaps she thinks that anything
after 6 p.m. is night. Must be listed as unknown (meager data,
single witness, very short duration.)

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire

I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New
Hampshire. I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire
case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.

Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit
Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.

Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover
Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case,
all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my getting a
copy of the Air Force investigation of same. Based on NICAP
report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I have only the card on this case, but judging from it there
seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was caused
by low-flying bird reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to
10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.

I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it
