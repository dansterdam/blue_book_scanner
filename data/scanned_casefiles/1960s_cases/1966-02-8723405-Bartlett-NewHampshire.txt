Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
Supplemental Sheet A
4 June 1968

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire.

Even these witnesses.. Has been evaluated as possible aircraft. After a phone call, the case remains indeterminate. Mr. and Mrs. XXXX, very articulate when it comes to description of the incident, are farm people who are not very sophisticated about the technical aspects of the case. However, the main thing is they say the usual thing in such cases, if never saw anything like this before and apparently they haven't. 

There are a few inconsistencies. In the original report they said that the noon was out, and acting in the west, and in the phone conversations they said there was no moon. So I don't know, but outside of that, the description of the light was very bright, something like a large yard light. The duration was about that before the sighting and that he had been uneasy all evening. This of course proves nothing as the movement of the light or the shaping or anything seems to be causing no problems.

I originally called because of the reported action of the dog. However, this came to naught since they admitted that the dog had behaved this way before and since. However, they said the dog's behavior was highly agitated, but of a form suggesting curiosity rather than fear. They said the high-pitched dog whistles inaudible to humans. Mr. XXXX said the light was very bright, something like a large yard light. The duration was about that before the sighting and that he had been uneasy all evening. This of course proves nothing as the movement of the light or the shaping or anything seems to be causing no problems.

Original sighting was made by Mrs. XXX who says this sort of thing occurs quite frequently and indicates how ready people are in this area to accept the existence of flying saucers and indicates also that they are not startled when they appear.

As far as evaluation is concerned, present evaluation that "possible aircraft" is one possibility, along with possible unknown. There are no airports within 50 miles according to Mr. XXXX. Weather bright red light, which soon became motionless, hardly fits the description of an aircraft. It would be much more inclined to call this a possible unknown rather than a possible aircraft. It could also be evaluated as insufficient information, because with my phone calls the actual number of information remains woefully meager.

It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one half minute. There were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred right on December 26, it is probable that there were no visitors as witnesses.
15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One person's duration of sighting was only 15 seconds. Witness was a 67 year old lady. Sighting occurred at 9p.m. and still have been reasonably bright. Witness said sighting occurred at night and very brief. Perhaps some thinks that anything after 6 p.m. is night. Must be listed as unknown (unger sighting witnesses).
16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire.
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire, it does seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case.
17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.
18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my getting a report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.
19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have a more complete report from it there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was caused by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to 70 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.
20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it a matter of record.
