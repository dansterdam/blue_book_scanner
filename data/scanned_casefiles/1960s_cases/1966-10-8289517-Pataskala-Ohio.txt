34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 Day 10 Month 66' Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a result of your sighting.

There are no airports, or Air Force Bases in the area where the object was sighted. The other party sighted it again when returning to his home which is in the same general area. He heard the same sound as before, saw the same movement, then the object "flew" away in the southwest for the last time. It gave the impression of moving in two directions at once, because it crossed our path and passed us both at the same time. At the point when it was coming toward us to fly across us, the "headlight" of the object shown right through the car window onto my shoulder, but I could look directly at the beam and there was absolutely NO glare. 
It was approximately 1 mile away when it shined on us. 
It could stop in mid-air and "hover", and it did so frequently.
Then it could take off and reach an unbelivable speed in no time.
When it changed directions, there was no "skid" or "slide". It made a 90 degree turn(while going at this high speed), but it stayed in the exact same spot while doing so. In other words, it could make "flat" turns.
It had two more "headlights" shining out of the bottom of this object which it flashed on and seemed to look at the road and then flashed back off again. It seemed as though the object was watching us, too, and "played a game" with us for the length of the hour.
We both knew somehow that the object was not out to harm us in any way, and a strange primitive feeling came over us when the

OBJECT WAS WITHIN THE CLOSEST RANGE.
WE STOPPED ONCE AND TURNED OFF THE CAR ENGINE AND LIGHTS AND IT FLEW OVER US AT WHICH TIME WE HEARD THE SOUND OF IT. WHEN IT PASSED OVER FOR THE FINAL TIME, IT WAS COMING STRAIGHT AT US, AND THEN AS IT FLEW OVER, IT TILTED, AS WE HAVE SHOWN IN THE DRAWING ON PAGE 3, QUESTION #19. WHEN IT PASSED OVER US, THERE WAS NO RADIO INTERFERENCE, AND THERE WAS NO WIND, SUCH AS THERE IS WHEN BEING PASSED BY A SEMI TRUCK.
THERE ARE MANY DETAILS WE COULD FILL IN, FOR ALOT HAPPENED WITHIN THE 55 MINUTES THAT WE WATCHED, CHASED, AND LISTENED TO IT. IF YOU FEEL THAT I HAVE LEFT OUT ANY INFORMATION THAT IS PERTINENT TO THIS SIGHTING, YOU MAY CONTACT ME AT MY HOME, OR THE OTHER PARTY AT HIS HOME. I HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU, EVEN IF IT'S THE SLIGHTEST BIT.

The image appears to contain a photograph or sketch of some unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image shows small lights of different colors, including red, green, blue, white, and pink, that were observed moving in a particular direction.

The text in the document reads as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YES It did not fade away or rush away, it appeared to just vanish.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES It moved behind such things as trees, and at one time, a telephone post.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES Trees, telephone post and wires. Never in front of the moon that we can remember.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - no sound at all
b. Color - dark, brownish, metallic gray 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object is covered by the length of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
We watched this object for one hour, almost. It was very close to us at one time, and when it was closest to us, many parts of it would have been covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture of what will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place on arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The sketch shows several small lights of different colors (red, green, blue, white, pink) that were moving in this direction when passing overhead. They were different colors and gave the impression of being hundreds of feet in diameter.
