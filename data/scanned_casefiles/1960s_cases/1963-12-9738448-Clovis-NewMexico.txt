Text extracted from the document:

FALL OF FOAM IN MEXICO
On December 15, 1963, a call came into Casa Dos in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Because he was busy at the time and unable to go, but 10 minutes later received a second call from the same source - a person who said if at all possible, he got into his car and hurried up to the location.
When he reached Gate Dos he found Inspector Aranda, who filled in the details as to: At 10, he said, a huge, unidentified object had come in from the north and landed about a hundred yards off the gate. Ten minutes later, Gordillo called Paz the incident, reported that two more similar objects were approaching.
The two objects finally reached a point and not precisely "bounced" off the ground but, as if from a burst or were literally "bouncing" around a firing radius of about 100 yards from the bouncers took them between 2 and 6 feet off the ground. The on the Agua Prieta dialog and a range of stubby mesquite trees inhibited the showered through the foliage. 
A strong north wind was blowing and the objects were being driven along the ground. They reached the immediate area in order to tear apart on the ground, their repeated bounces apparently had no effect in their sharp, slender brushes caused them to literally shred and take portions, each measuring approximately two square feet dimension. One was the other at the base of shrubs.
The one in the water showed signs of deterioration in the shredded portions.
After taking the picture, inquiries found that the foam (See Foam - Pg. 2)

U.A.P.R.O. BULLETIN

Foam
(Continued from Page 1)
The foam was destroyed by frightened children and adults who spread some of it over their bodies and heads, mistaking it for a substance that might be dangerous or injurious to the skin. This is reminiscent of an incident at the farm in Orleans, Illinois during the fall of 1958 when a similar substance fell from the sky and was similarly treated.
When the foam was examined again there was no evidence of any distinguishing characteristics. The foam had completely disintegrated.
Examination of the samples indicates that the substance may have been caused by the emergency ejection of a substance similar to the foam used to extinguish airplane fires. It is identical in appearance to that type of foam. We conclude, this substance seems to be some form of aircraft emergency foam, perhaps from a small military craft in the area, although there is no confirmation of any such incident or craft in the area at the time. We would appreciate it if our readers could provide any information they may have regarding this incident.

SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCER INCIDENT - AUG 64

Air Force Intelligence Officers investigated a report of unidentified flying objects over Northern California, unable to explain why hundreds of people on the ground could see them while Air Force pilots could not. There was widespread interest in the sightings, because it occurred coincidentally with the flight of spacecraft Venus. A spokesman at Hamilton Air Force Base said that a report from the Sheriff's office at Clovis, California, described a large unidentified flying object "constantly changing back and forth and changing colors" in the sky over Clovis. The Air Force was immediately alerted, and in turn called the State Civil Defense. At the same time the Federal Aviation Administration Tower at Oakland directed all civilian aircraft in the area to be on the alert for UFO or unidentified craft. Pilots flying in the area could see lights but were unable to make positive contact. Radar was also unable to pick up the object. Twenty minutes later, a second report came that the UFO was back and now circling the Greenfield-Salinas area. A supersonic jet interceptor was being considered, the UFO suddenly climbed straight up and disappeared. As the unidentified spokesman said, "twenty minutes after the initial report was made at 5:20 it also came from the Sheriff's Office, saying the object had returned for the third time." This morning's newspaper carried the largest UFO sighting in recent years, which was reported in the "CITIZEN NEWS", DECEMBER 13, 1963, HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA. Warrant Officer Ernest Fournoy Jr., where stationed in Wernich Germany, tracked the signals of the UFO. Pa, 19149.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
JAN.-FEB.66 
The newspaper La Gaceta for December 17 reports that a railway worker named Gerardo Gal-
lardo claims to have had an extraordinary experience. According to his account to the police, while strik-
ing a match to light his pipe at the entrance to his railway station, he observed a strange aerial object
hovering overhead. Instead of his match flame going out, as might be expected, the paper states, a
shaft of light came from the saucer-shaped object and bathed Gallardo in its beam. Upon regaining normal
sight, he found that his pipe was unlit, and his wireless went dead. Gallardo rushed out and saw the
object for about four minutes, he says, before it moved off, varying its speed and altitude. Gallardo
reported his story to the police, passengers on the hour-ping train declared that they had just seen
on the track.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed text describing a reported UFO sighting near Rmnea, New Zealand. The text is titled "Ruby "Rings" Over NZ" and describes an observation of slowly moving, glowing, pulsating objects in the night sky that were briefly observed by the witness.

Ruby "Rings" Over NZ
V. C. Burnett reported in a letter to the Rongotea, N.Z. Land Press, that on 10-15 p.m. on 9-5-63, he saw traveling slowly in an east-west direction, low enough to be visible through trees, a series of glowing, pulsating, ruby red colored objects in the space between the treetops which were clearly discernible. The objects appeared to accelerate slightly at intervals. While Burnett was observing them, they moved slightly to the left and made a slight detour to the Norrogowa. They then moved on out of sight. He prevailed a view of it for about 3 minutes.
