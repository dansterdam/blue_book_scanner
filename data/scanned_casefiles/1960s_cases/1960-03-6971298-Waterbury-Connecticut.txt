March 15, 1960

Dear Sirs,

On March 14, 1960 at approximately 6:15 P.M., I observed what we think was a flying saucer. I called my mother, father, and my sisters to observe it also. It was flying at a high altitude, and was circular in shape, and very brightly lighted. It was travelling at a very low speed, so we observed it for a few minutes. The next day in my school class room, I told my teacher about it. He then told the members of our class about it, and found out other children had observed the same thing with their parents on the same evening, so I decided the best thing to do was to tell you about it.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
