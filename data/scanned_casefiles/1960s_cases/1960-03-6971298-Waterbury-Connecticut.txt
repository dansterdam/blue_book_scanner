Transcribing the text:

Dear Sir:
On March 3, 1960 at approximately 6:15 p.m. my family and I observed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be hovering or slowly moving in a northwesterly direction. It was a bright object and appeared to be larger than a star or planet. It was viewed for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing.

There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image shows a typed letter from someone reporting their observation of what they believe was a flying saucer on March 11, 1960. The letter is addressed to the U.S. Defense Dept. in Washington D.C. and contains a detailed account of the observation.

U.S. Defense Dept.
Washington, D.C.
March 15, 1960

Dear Sirs:

On March 11, 1960 at approximately 6:15 P.M., I observed what we think was a flying saucer. I called my father, and my sister to have a look at it. It was traveling at a high altitude and was circular in shape, and very brightly lighted. It was traveling at a very low speed. As we observed it, a peculiar kind of glow seemed to encircle it. We then told the members of our class about it, and found out that other children had observed the same thing with their parents on the same evening, so I decided the best thing to do was to tell you about it.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
