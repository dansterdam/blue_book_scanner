INCIDENT PHOTOGRAPHED IN WEST VIRGINIA: While visiting our Telemetry
rival in Clarksburg, W. VA. recently, we came across a very interesting incident
ing flight in the more town which the local source investigator had previously
looked into. Located approximately 20 miles from Clarksburg in a local news
paper of 1960, the object pictured at the top of Page 14 is now in our files.
     As shown on the negative, nothing in the scene has been a natural point, causing
able dog to start barking. We went outside, and saw a strange craft moving
along over a nearby hill. Returning quickly into this house, Gonzales grabbed
his camera and took several pictures. The object was one of two gray to
     Gonzales describes the object as saucer-shaped, about 40 feet in diameter.
     The 4 that were taken were of good photographic quality.

FORTEAN ITEMS: A very large amount of unidentified material fell on
recent land at Waco, Oak Cliff, Tennessee, last November 27th. The stuff fell
all over the ground and broke branches on the trees where it fell. The farmer
the ground where it fell.

March 4 brought a report from Bedford, Massachusetts where a dark red spherical
UFO was observed in the eastern sky at 9:15 P.M. by [redacted], [redacted].
Charles Hayden Planetarium in Boston. He and his wife watched the
object for over 5 minutes near the Constellation Bootes. It pulsated from red to
white to red and caused bright white streaks to appear and disappear in its
immediate area.

On March 2 at Beverly Mr. and [redacted] and their daughter watched a large circular UFO at 7:15 P.M. The object maneuvered, divided in two and then sped away. The object, which first hovered, had star-like rays around it and appeared to be larger than the apparent diameter of the Moon. After the reddish object divided it moved northward across the eastern sky and rejoined into one object.
