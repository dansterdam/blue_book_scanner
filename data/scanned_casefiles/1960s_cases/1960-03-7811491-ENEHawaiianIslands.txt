Hawaiian Islands,FPO San Francisco, California

1. On 29 January 1960, at approximately 2315 hours, local time, the writer aboard the USS Massey, DD-778, observed three unidentified objects moving rapidly across the sky in a northeasterly direction.

2. These objects appeared as elongated shapes, yellow-orange in color, and estimated to be approximately 1000 yards in length. They were observed for approximately 30 to 45 seconds before disappearing from view. The sighting took place approximately 150 miles southwest of the Hawaiian Islands.

3. The objects were observed by all personnel on the bridge of the USS Massey at the time of the sighting. The Officer of the Deck, the Quartermaster of the Watch, and the Lookouts on watch all concurred in the observation.

4. No explanation for the sighting can be offered at this time. The objects did not conform to any known aircraft or missiles, and their size, speed, and manner of flight were quite unusual. A more detailed report will be submitted upon receipt of further information.
