Dear Mr.

Reference is made to the report entitled "Observations and Discovery" which you recently sent to the Air Force.

Your sightings of September 10-20, 1963 coincide with the passage of ECHO K. The ECHO schedule for San Diego for the period September 9-20 is attached.

The book "Light and Color" by A.E. Minnaert is an excellent reference for information regarding illusions or optical phenomena associated with the distortion of ECHO's flight path.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: AFSC (TTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. The attached correspondence and report was received in the Intelligence Division, 22nd Bombardment Wing (H) at 1000 hours on 17 October 1963. Due to the lapse of time since the writing of the report and information contained in the report, no action has been taken by this unit. It will be noted that several official agencies of the United States Government were apparently notified during the alleged sighting. Senior Director, Air Defense, Los Angeles who probably has already reported on this matter.

2. If further information is desired concerning this report an officer can be detailed to perform an inquiry. It would appear, however, that a more comprehensive inquiry could be performed by naval personnel assigned in the San Diego area.

3. A letter has been sent to Mr. [redacted] informing him of the disposition of his report.

September, 1963
San Diego, Calif.

On Sept. 10, 1963, in Serra Mesa, San Diego, [redacted] amateur astronomer, 25 years of age, was casually peering into the sky, with and without a 6 inch Newtonian Reflecting Telescope, when at 20 minutes after the hour of 10:00 (10:20 p.m. Pacific MST) pointed out a light to my companion, [redacted] with whom I was living.

It appeared as a second or third magnitude star, moving toward a point directly above our heads (technically known as the "Zenith"), from the horizon at 330° N., 35° elevation.

We both observed the "Light" to be traveling at fairly high speed, due to its apparent high altitude. It was a reddish color, as opposed to white or bluish - like Mars.

At first appearance, it seemed to be a satellite, but, its erratic, sometimes "drunk" movements in its course, would seem to dissolve that theory quickly.

As the light drew wanderingly towards a point just 75° north of the Zenith, it appears to wander aimlessly, more slowly, more erratically, and its light extinguishes briefly many times per minute. This periodic extinguishment I will call an "occultation", for it seems to occult every night that we (and many others) observed it. The object cannot be seen on overcast nights, nor could the 7x50 binoculars help us well, even with my compass bearing to orientate then. I will endeavor to appear once time some ludicrously to them, at the time my group was observing.

the phenomenon). UFO, "Sidereal Object" (SO) is what I have
named the object.

On the second night, Sept. 17, 1963, "it" was sighted at 10:25
pm PST. It was reported immediately after checked, to be sure it
was the same object that first was noted. I observed the night before,
I called the FM and gave the necessary information, then I called
Radio KGO, Mr. Lee Shoblon, and told him my story. I recorded my
type report, and put it on the air at 11:00 pm that night. I had
very phone calls that night, all wondering "what" it was, that I had
witnessed. My answer being an equivocal "haven't the faintest idea."

The disc, jack, Mr. Shoblon, toward me a special phone number
to call the next evening. The FM said he was near was young, by
rating, to be clear vertically into infinity.

The people all over San Diego were on roof tops with telescopes,
binoculars and naked eyes, trained in my reported direction, when at
exactly 10:22 and 20 seconds, my assistant, in _______ now's noted
the UFO making its glorious appearance, keening, weirdly, the sky
overhead, beginning to zig-zag and obliquely maneuver, occult, and soon
less bright, and at the same time slow its general speed somewhat.

At about 10:40, it began to linger in the center of a triangular
tion of three stars, then began to wander almost as though out of control, fading very carefully, occultly less, and at 10:13 pm it disappeared from sight (using naked eye).

KGO was given my official report immediately after completion.
Many calls were received at the radio station after and during the
phenomenon. Mr. Shoblon recorded some fifty-odd observers throughout
town. Even one by a Girl Scout group -- in Texas.

I was informed after giving two nights details to the Senior
Director, Air Defense, Los Angeles, that a large radar station in the
L.A. vicinity, did pick up and track the UFO. They confirmed its actual
existence, and no more.

Also, the FM, "SOL," hovers infrequently (3-5 times) each trip.
It hovers from 5 to 10-12 seconds.

The writer witnessed the object, Sept. 10, 11, 12, and 13. The
14th and 15th were overcast, so no observations were made, although
attempted (in case the object was lower than the clouds). The clouds
were at 1500 feet altitude.


- page 10 -

I will receive many written reports from the observers who even
down, (for Sept. 12) and will study them for possible further evidence.

I am still waiting for a call from the Air Force UFO Center
earlier in Detroit, Los Angeles. Someone will be notified soon.

Still has answered ridiculously every successive evening since
Sept. 10. (I understand this is the same seen on Sept. 9 and by other
unknown observers, in San Diego.)

An anonymous associate reports seeing the exact (so far as we can
deduce) same object every summer, for the last six consecutive years,
for a couple months during the end of summer. Relatively, no satellite
could have been the cause of this object, or the object itself. - have
learned balloons, for similar obvious reasons, not often now-a-days.

We have reason to believe an aircraft interceptor was trying to
probe the area on Sept. 12. No other information about that observation
has been received.

We are trying to organize a group of interested, responsible
amateur astronomers, and other concerned people to attack this thing
with more power.

On two enclosed sheets is other pertinent information; one is a
course map, the other is a chart showing data of each observation, such
as times, distances, bearings, etc.

The object usually takes from 2 to 20 or 30 seconds, at
random, for a lapsed time of non-incandescence for just 1/4 of a
second to approximately one second (usually not the latter). It will
deviate sharply every 3-5 seconds, after it has climbed to 50° eleva-
tion above the horizon.

NOTE: It does not vary or curve its turns. By that, it ignores laws
of centrifugal force. A 90° turn is quite common for the UFO.

One more thing, the U.S. had no satellites six years ago and no
planes, even now, that can maneuver like "SIL". The person that told
me of his six years observation is an (zero-) rate Scientist.

NOTE - "SIL" was not seen upon the date of the completion of this
report, Sept. 17. Observation was made between 10:13 and
10:40 p.m.

Observations of
September 10 and 11, 1963

RADAR REPORT - GIVEN TO KGEO RADIO

Sept. 11, 1963

All directions and speeds, chronological measurements and altitudes are close to accurate to my belief, but must be confirmed by parabolic reflector telescope, scanning the sky, when, with my naked eye, I observed a light, of a second magnitude, with a reddish tint such as that of the planet Mars (which for the record I will dub the light "Capel" above the south-western horizon moving in a "general" South-eastern direction, about 27 degrees above horizon (low in western).

The "Capel" was moving in a general direction, by that I mean, with all the erratic turns, oblique zig-zag maneuvering, flashing on and off, the craft still moved in one "general" direction as a whole (average).

I mentioned the "flashing" on and off before, well, the most of "off", or longer, was an entire from 1/2 second to 1 full second and possibly 1 1/2 now in again. The time between the brief shut-offs was anywhere from 10 seconds to half a minute.

These times, measurements, etc. will be measured more carefully later.

As to the craft's speed: it was similar to that observed of a satellite in orbit. You guess... but since erratic movements? Flashes on and off better by calling the occultations...? Winged aircraft...? I witnessed the exact same sight tonight on the 11th. But it happened at approximately 10:25 instead of 10:20 as on the previous evening. It lasted 12 to 23 minutes, then it gains altitude apparently and fades, appearing to hover more, would less, deviate or maneuver less, about 20 degrees just below the zenith.
