[Handwritten text, partially legible, appears to be a detailed narrative description of a UFO sighting. The text describes following an object, being concerned about a jet plane, and watching something unusual. The date mentioned is October 2nd, 1966. There are references to calling the Highway Patrol and Police, and mentions of other witnesses.]

The text is handwritten and some parts are difficult to fully transcribe with complete certainty. The document appears to be a detailed personal account of a UFO sighting, with the header "AFR 80-17(C1)" at the top of the page.

SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATIONS, 22 June 1968

Lt Marano called Mr. [redacted] with regards to his aerial advertising plane.

Mr. [redacted] was flying in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, and Kettering on the night of 22 June 1968 and was over Franklin at approximately 10:30 pm on 22 June 1968. His plane was visible for approximately 15 miles distance. He was advertising for [redacted] for their festival.

Mr. [redacted] also said that his plane was in the area for the Mt Healthy sighting that was written about. He didn't know if his plane was in the area for the other sighting since he didn't know the exact location of it. We told him it was about 20 miles up river from Cincinnati. He said that his plane was visible for approximately fifteen miles in the distance and that he had been operating as far east of Cincinnati as Mt Washington. Lt Marano said that we would write him a short note listing some of the towns in the area of the sighting.
