35. Information which you feel will help tell the full story adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

So #30. I will try to list other UFO's I have seen before & after the March 2. observation. Most of these were convincing enough prior to March 2. to make me feel I believed. Wake a report to AF-After the March 2 sighting I have seen several I would like to report but have put off doing so because of delay & I was quite busy getting ready to leave town & attend a convention in Nashville for D.C.

Jan. 28 (believe that is correct date) Saturday, 2:05 pm - saw a small, bright, silvery object from my backyard, in general NE direction. No sound. Saw it 3-4 min. Clear, all lights hazy day. Saw no wing on it or felt it move. Note slowly than airplane. Told a friend about it & she called W. Butler Bushing the next day. Saw two other similar objects that same afternoon.

March 12 - A bright, clear, Sunday afternoon, about 2:15 pm. From corner of Jackson & University Blvd, saw a round, egg-shaped, yellowish white object - gave brightly, overhead from South to North. No sound. It went on a straight line, did not swerve or wiggle at all (I thought it was a balloon) or change altitude. Wind was from South, 6-7 mph, but this went further & was out of sight in less than 1 minute. Looked about 500 feet altitude. A friend was with me & also saw it. Later we glimpsed it again.

I save it for some other object. Still later (30 min. later) will tell out report and plus of this case.

Between March 12 & 18 from my backyard I saw several UFO's (all at night)

A small reddish light, the same bright area as a relatively bright star, which moved in a straight line but then circled, made no noise. At disappeared when I went to get another observer.

While I was peering intently at it, a dark, perhaps transparent thing spanned overhead at lower alt. Truth & was gone before I could focus on it. No sound. It was late at night & could have been a bird, but I have repeatedly a bird like that at that time. It went straight - not like a bird (-?)

At low - flying object (about 5 - 10 degree from horizon) with pulsating red & orange lights, no noise. Late at night, moving from SE to NW - no to 50 - 60 due east of my backyard - Have seen this 20 3 times & neighbor have also. The most impressive sighting was when it floated & moved slow, flashed & light, with lights changing from white to red to green - like sparklers! Could see no shape or outline. Too low for airplane & no sound. Other neighbor have seen odd reddish objects near R.R. tracks 1/2 E. of my house. All this dogs barked in observation of the object & this is why I went out to look.

Late night (March 23) several neighbors & I saw a bright light almost northwest in NW direction, low on horizon for 10 minutes or more. It dimmed, grew bright, moved out & nearly went out or faded out. I called a friend.

Page 9

Was listen in that direction about 7 miles away, but she did not see it. I thought it was a star at first, even though there is no bright star in that direction. - The evening star in several compass points South of here. There were no clouds & nothing visible which could have caused it to seem dimmer. Binoculars were not too helpful - it still looked small, but some observers thought it was disc shaped - like or or shaped like a disc. Impression at first was moving car on way home & said it was shapely. They saw the object in the Commercial Appeal (there was a report of "strange ovals" in the sky set by several people, including policemen) this newspaper is rather considerable in reporting UFO's. The evidence must have been rather strong. The article said the sighting was from 8-10 pm, & it was about that time (8:00 or earlier) we saw the bright object.

I hope this will help. I will be glad to fill out more report & to be more accurate as to time, etc., if you would like. Ours


- page 5 -

Several children have also seen a long, white object at night which moved from W. to E. in our neighborhood. It seemed almost transparent. I would stop & then move very rapidly. I believe they saw this on March 16 or 15 at about 10:00 pm. They all saw it at once & came running into their neighbor's backyard, quite excited & even a bit frightened. (They also got excited over a plaid old star base, but I think they wanted attention, whether on March 15 or 16.) They seemed convinced & already had lots of attention when we were discussing their previous UFO sighting for the first time.)

Dear Maj. Quintillis,

I would like some information on UFOs sighted around Memphis, Tenn.

I am a boy about 11 years of age and very interested in the subject of UFO and even sighted one.

It was on Saturday March 18, 1967.

On Saturday night my friend (blacked out) and I (blacked out) were over at his home for about 4 hours when we saw it. (We always go over in (blacked out))

York on Friday and Saturday night looking for (blacked out) UFOs. It was located being on airplane because it followed the landing pattern and by most planes landing at the Municipal airport.

It went across the sky four times. It took off at a tremendous speed.

I was at [blacked out] house watching for UFOs with him, when I saw this object and said "Hey look! there's something". I asked him what time it was and he said "10:05".

The object moved back and forth across the sky, and on fifth time across, it took off and moved to a stationary position and went out of sight.

I would appreciate it if you would send me several Ftd 164 forms with envelopes in the case that of sight another object.


- page 18 -

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 17 April 67

Investigation revealed that there are two air refueling tracks in the area. The witness stated in the initial letter that the object looked like an aircraft in a landing pattern. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft sighting. An aircraft in a landing pattern could have accounted for the sighting.

Dear Major Quanteville,

Could you give me Project Blue Book's information of my sighting of March (18th or 20th)?

Also, could you give me the names of all the people who have sighted U.A.O.'s in the Batesville, Miss. area in the past 3 years? I would also appreciate any supplemental information you could supply with.

Thanks,

Personal Regards

UFO Observation, 18 March 1967

Memphis, Tennessee 38116

1. This replies to your recent letter in which you requested the evaluation of your March 18, 1967 UFO observation.

2. You described the unidentified object as looking like an airplane, the lighting arrangement you drew is similar to that of an aircraft and you stated that the object looked like it followed the landing pattern used by most planes landing at the Municipal Airport. For these reasons, we feel that you observed aircraft in their landing patterns. Also, there are two or three breaks in your area. There is no indication that you observed anything extraterrestrial. Due to various atmospheric conditions, people often misinterpret conventional aircraft or unidentified objects.

3. The Air Force is unable to release the names of witnesses to UFO sightings without their permission. UFO cases are filed chronologically and not geographically, making a search for reports from Batesville, Mississippi too time consuming for the staff in our office.

4. The enclosed Blue Book brochure may be of interest to you. Thank you for your letter.
