Based on the image provided, there does not appear to be any photograph or image included. The image shows a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and response fields.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing any distinguishing features of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or any other evidence of the direction the object was moving.
