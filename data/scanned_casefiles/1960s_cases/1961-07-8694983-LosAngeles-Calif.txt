Hq USAF Col Friend
AFOIN-3 Report (Mr. [redacted])                                     26 July 1962

MGEN
AFOIN-3 (Major Hare)
Wash 25 DC

1. Reference the attached copy of a letter to General Bernard Schriever
from Mr. [redacted] concluding information on a UFO sighted by the radar
operator at [redacted]. The referenced letter does not contain sufficient information to allow a meaningful conclusion. In his suggested that a questionnaire, "DD Form 164", July 1961, be forwarded to Mr. [redacted] with instructions for him to complete
and return it in lieu of a narrative report.

2. In addition to the questions on the form, it is desirable that Mr. [redacted]
provide answers to the following:

a. How was the 25 second time duration determined?

b. Was the duration the same for all sightings?

c. What was the approximate number of times the object was
observed to flash?

3. It is suggested that you inform Mr. [redacted] that factors such as
altitude of the aircraft, wind direction, temperature in which aircraft
is moving, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, background noise, etc.,
have bearing on whether or not noise from an aircraft can be heard and
the visibility conditions around the aircraft. It is further suggested
when moving South to North and the supplement of that angle when moving
between to South. Any object which appears a given parallel at no angles
that are not supplementary is not a satellite.
