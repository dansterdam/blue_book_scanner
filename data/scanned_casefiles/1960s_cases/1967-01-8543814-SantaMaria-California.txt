PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 27 Jan 67  23/0132

2. LOCATION: Santa Maria, California  2 witnesses

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: to the NW

8. PHOTOS: Yes

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Washington (possible)
1. Unidentified
2. Photo provides nothing more than circular light-toned images.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The object appeared as an aircraft without running lights, but quite brighter. The lights appeared brighter than the brightest star. They were compared to the headlight of a car at approximately one block or so. Only white lights were observed.

Photo examination revealed that the lights appeared only as circular light-toned images. The description is consistent with that of some type of aircraft engaged in aerial advertising. The photographs do support such a probability.

When we (Maria Rainer) and I first sighted the object it was so unusual. Both of our attention at the same time. The light was only white with no running lights visible. A tungsten light such as a lamp would give off a orange cast which the object didn't do. I used Ekktachrome daylight MS. ASA 64 at a time exposure of 2 sec. at f/5.6. The stars we were right next that were still the brightest light star in the sky didn't record on the film where or the object did.

SAT-OICO/MacCassel/op/790832Rev67

Dear Mr [redacted]:

Reference your recent unidentified observation and subsequent slides of numerous unidentified objects.

Examination of the slides revealed the images on Frames 39, 40, and 41 were generally similar and consisted of a roughly circular light-toned image. A crescent shaped portion of the circular image presented a brighter tone that remained. On Frame 37, the objects consisted of a circular light-toned image with a small darker image in its center.

Frame 41 contained four images and a void between the first and second images of sufficient size to accommodate a possible fifth. Distances between images gradually decreased in size, as though in a turn.

Although no positive explanation of the images has been determined, the description is consistent with that of some type of aircraft engaged in aerial advertising. The photographs support such a probability.

Enclosed are the five color slides which were submitted for analysis. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. We appreciate your cooperation.

Sincerely,

P NRS    Ektachrome daylight film, Frames 37, 39, 40, 41 submitted by Mr. [redacted]
          Santa Maria, California

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-42 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., USAF. The work order requested photo analysis of four photographic color slides and identification of certain unidentified objects appearing thereon.

2. ANALYSIS: Frame numbers 37, 39, 40 and 41 of Ektachrome daylight film were received with the work order. The absence of Frame 38, which would normally appear within the sequence of frames exposed, is not explained in FTD Form 146, prepared by Mr. [redacted], which accompanied the work order.

a. Examination revealed that the images on Frames 39, 40 and 41 were generally similar and consisted of a roughly circular light-toned image. A crescent shaped portion of the circular image presented a brighter tone than the remainder. On Frame 37, the objects consisted of a circular light-toned image with a small darker image in its center. The circular light-toned image was surrounded throughout its circumference by a reddish-orange band. The unidentifiable objects were generally aligned and equally spaced across each band.

(1) Frame 37: 3 images present, two in line, the third less distinct and slightly out of alignment, the lateral distance between the second and third being greater than separation between the first and second.

(2) Frame 39: 10 images with a void between the fifth and sixth and between the sixth and tenth images. The voids were of sufficient size to accommodate an added image in each instance.

(3) Frame 40: 9 images with voids between the second and third images of a sufficient size to accommodate 2 images, between the fifth and sixth to accommodate a single image, between the sixth and seventh to accommodate 2 images and a void between the eighth and ninth to accommodate a single image.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-29     DATED 27 April 1967

(4) Frame 11 contained four images and a void between the first and second images of sufficient size to accommodate a possible fifth. Distances between images gradually decreased in size as though in a turn.

b. A photo processing specialist was contacted and after examination of the film advised that the images were probably valid images and not attributable to camera malfunction, lens aberration or defect in film or processing.

c. Although no explanation of the images has been arrived at, the possibility that the images represent a revolving anti-colission light or other aircraft light exists. Detailed information as to location in respect to an airfield or aircraft flight path and flight schedules would be required for a valid comment on this possibility.
