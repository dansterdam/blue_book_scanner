Like a Big Old Cigar

UFO Over La Porte Area
Is Reported by 4 Men

Four men reporting seeing an unidentified flying object that looked like a big old cigar Sunday morning in the La Porte area Sunday morning.

They said the object was big, looked like a cigar have been 10 feet in diameter and 15 feet long, with Roy Poe, 57, of 5718 Grace Lane, Houston. He said the object was dark in color.

DESCRIBED like a big old cigar up there with colored lights, Poe said, "It seemed like it was drifting along, kind of easy like." He estimated the object's speed at 150 MPH.

The men sighted the object shortly before 9 AM as they were in the Ancker Reef Works at Deer Park, Poe said. He said the object was well up in the air, with lots of clear sky.

Poe said the UFO was flying over, so he was able to see it with unobstructed view. He said the object was flying at a low altitude.

THIS BRINGS total of reported UFO sightings in the La Porte area to 4, Poe said. At first captain at the Ancker Reef Works, John Boyd of La Porte, a ship fitter at the same plant, and Bill Cox, working at La Porte, the first to see the object.

Poe said as nearly as he could tell the object was a type of UFO that has been reported in the area before. He said he was able to get a good look at it.

Victoria Launching

'UFO' at La Porte
A Weather Balloon?

The unidentified flying object was sighted over La Porte at 8:45 a.m. Sunday probably was a weather balloon released at Victoria through hours earlier.

Clyde Young, meteorologist at the Victoria weather station, said a balloon was sent aloft at 5:15 a.m. one of two daily launchings made at the station.

The Weather Bureau here said the winds aloft, between 10,000 and 20,000 feet, were from the West, southwest, or generally toward La Porte.

The object was first seen by Al Cooling, a weather balloon at the Anchor Boat Works in La Porte. He called Capt. Foutench, Port captain, and both watched the object through binoculars. They said it was cigar shaped.

Capt. Foutench said, "It moved slowly from the south to the north and didn't move in any other direction. It just hovered."

The object was also seen by John Boyd, a shoefitter at the boat works and by Roy Penteleon, 5715 Grace Lane.

(c) Address: Anchor Boat Works, La Porte, Texas
(d) Occupation: Port Captain
(e) Education: Unknown
(f) Estimate of Reliability: Good

7. Weather and Winds Aloft Conditions
(a) Observers observation: Very clear, no clouds
(b) Winds aloft (from Ellington AFB Weather Station): Surface, 130/60, 190/15, 10,000*, 270/45, 16,000*, 250/30; 20,000*, 250/30; 30,000*, 260/15; 50,000*, 260/45; 60,000*, 250/145; 80,000*, UNK.

8. Unusual activity or conditions that could account for UFO Sighting:
None (see comments of investigating officer).

9. Interception or identification action: None (see comments of investigating officer).

10. Air Traffic and Balloon Releases
(a) Aircraft: The observer reported seeing what he thought was a jet fighter type aircraft producing a con-trail approach the UFO from the west at an altitude much higher than the UFO. When the jet reached the vicinity of the UFO it made a sharp left turn and proceeded in a northerly direction. The observer did not think the jet could have seen the UFO because of its higher altitude. No jet aircraft departed from Ellington prior to the UFO sighting and attempts to identify the jet aircraft were unsuccessful. Ellington weather station stated that jet aircraft would produce con-trails at 25,000 feet and higher.

(b) Balloon: The U. S. Weather Bureau released a weather balloon from its weather station at Victoria, Texas, at 0515 on the date of the sighting. Telephone conversations with a Mr. Jones at Victoria revealed the path of balloon as depicted on the attached maps. The information was taken from the weather station's official records. These records indicated the balloon burst at an altitude of 30,620 meters (101,046 feet) at 0657 CST. Since the time balloon burst was almost two hours before the UFO sighting (0845 CST) it appears that this balloon could not be an explanation for UFO sighting.

11. Photographic evidence: No photographs were taken.

12. Comments:
a. Although investigation did not disclose any other balloon launching other than those mentioned in this report, the observer stated that it was his opinion that this was a balloon of some type.

b. I could not uncover any other logistical explanation for this UFO sighting.

ASSIGNED RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR AIR NAVIGATION

Radio frequencies are divided by international agreement into eight bands identified as follows:
[Rest of text continues with detailed technical descriptions of radio frequency bands and their uses for various aviation and military communications purposes, including:

- Very High Frequencies (VHF)
- Ultra High Frequencies (UHF)
- Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) frequencies
- Use of Frequencies in Voice Communication

The document appears to be a technical guide explaining radio frequency allocations for air navigation, detailing specific frequency ranges for different types of communications such as air traffic control, emergency services, military communications, and navigation systems.

The text is dense with technical terminology and provides guidelines for radio communication in aviation contexts.]
