10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    The round object appearing as a white luminous
    cloud at estimated 36,000 ft observed to move
    at a slow rate of speed from NW to SE. Cloud
    appeared to spread at the center, at which time
    a bright reddish-orange ball appeared with a dome
    of a cloud and retained its configuration. Shape
    of a dome and retained the configuration while
    astronomer with group observing phenomena at
    first assumed object to be spiral nebula.

11. COMMENTS
    Probable cause of this sighting was a weather balloon which reached an altitude
    sufficient to cause it to explode and the
    following phenomena attributed to water
    vapor released at the time of explosion.
    The cloud was illuminated by the moon,
    which itself was 88% illuminated. Wind
    direction conforms to direction of the
    object.
