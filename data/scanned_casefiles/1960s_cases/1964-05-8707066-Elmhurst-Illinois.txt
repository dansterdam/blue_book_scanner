DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201
18 November 1964

Major Hector Quintanilla
Foreign Technology Division
Box 9494
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing the equatorial crossing sheets for Echo I and Echo II for the year 1964, to the present. I shall send you copies of the new sheets as they come along, as I have a good reason now to believe they will.

With reference to the Altus, Oklahoma sighting, 21 May 1964, that definitely has proved to be Echo II, as reference to the enclosed sheets will show. I believe the identification is positive.

The case of the Northwestern student from Elmhurst, Illinois is in abeyance. The student is no longer here but is now resident in the Virgin Islands. Since his sighting was very likely an aircraft, I don't think we need to pursue that one any further. The sighting, in any case, contained very little information, and it does not seem profitable to try to get more out of this chap at the present time. Since we have gone this far, however, if you feel it worthwhile, my gang and I here can send a letter off to him to see what it might bring forth. But I don't think it's much worthwhile.

What are your plans on coming to visit us? I would suggest the week of December 7 as the one following I am scheduled to be in Austin, Texas for a few days, and during the first week in December, I shall be in New Mexico.

With respect to the Altus case, would it not be a good idea to drop a note to Mr. and to let them know that they had seen Echo II? Good inter-Air Force relations.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
