11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness sighted a bright red light moving SE from his position. Object then agreed to stop in mid air and reverse direction and proceed to the NW. It disappeared gradually to the NW. No sound was heard.

The lights conform to standard aircraft lighting. The sound emitted by an aircraft would not be heard due to the strong surface wind at the 1000 ft level blowing the sound away from the area. Many light aircraft travel over that area.

IN SPRINGFIELD AND THE DECATUR MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG WIND AT THE 1000 FT LEVEL, THE
PAGE 4 RUCIS[A][3] UNCLAS
SOUND EMITTED BY AN AIRCRAFT WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER.
THE OVERCAST CONDITION IN THE AREA WOULD MAKE IT
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT.
THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER IS
QUESTIONABLE. THE WITNESS IS APPARENTLY VERY RELIABLE SINCE HE
DOES HAVE EXCELLENT KNOWLEDGE OF HELICOPTERS, WEATHER BALLOONS,
AIRCRAFT IN GENERAL AND A FAIR BACKGROUND OF SCIENCE.
IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT WAS A LIGHT AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA.
IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FABRICATE THIS.

L. (1) NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS.
L. (1) I FEEL FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS UNWARRANTED.

TO STANDARD LIGHT AIRCRAFT LIGHTING IN COLOR AND POSITION. I
CONTACTED MR CRAWFORD OF THE TAYLORVILLE AIRPORT AND WAS INFORMED
THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW AIRPORTS IN THE VICINITY AND THAT
STUDENT PILOTS MAKE FREQUENT FLIGHTS OVER THE AREA. MANY OF
THESE FLIGHTS ARE CONDUCTED IN LIGHT AIRCRAFT FROM CAPITAL AIRPORT
