UFO Observation, 22 June 1968

Dayton, Ohio 45440

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 22 June 1968 which you reported to the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

2. The stimulus for your sighting has been identified as an aircraft that had an electrical advertising sign attached to it. The plane is a Cessna 172 that operates between 50 to 60 mph and when the sign is lighted, it can be seen as far as 15 miles away. The sign was advertising for Steve Ford of Miamisburg and was operating in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, and Kettering on the night of 22 June.

The attached material is forwarded to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATIONS, 22 June 1968

Lt Marano called Mr. [redacted] with regards to his aerial advertising plane.

Mr. [redacted] was flying in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton and Kettering on the night of 22 June 1968 and was over Franklin at approximately 10:30 pm on 22 June 1968. His plane was visible for approximately 15 miles distance. He was advertising Stueve Ford of Miamisburg for their sentinel.

Mr. [redacted] also said that his plane was in the area for the Mt Healthy sighting that we had written about. He didn't know if his plane was in the area for the other sighting since he didn't know the exact location of it. We told him it was about 20 miles up river from Cincinnati. He said that his plane is visible for approximately fifteen miles in the distance and that he had been operating as far east of Cincinnati as Mt Washington. Lt Marano said that we would write him a short note listing some of the towns in the area of the sighting.
