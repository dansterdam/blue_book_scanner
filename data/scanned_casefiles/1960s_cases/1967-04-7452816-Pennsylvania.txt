35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The sighting was reported to the local police immediately. The craft or object was unconventional in appearance, hovering silently some distance from the observer's location. The object or craft appeared to be metallic, reflecting some of the moon's light. Approximate size was estimated to be around 30 feet in diameter. The object or craft hovered motionless for several minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. No sound was reported.

April 20, 1967
Dear Colonel Manale,
This morning's reply report to you of April 16, 1967, concerning my sighting of an apparent air craft, or an object unknown to myself, which I attempted to inform you of before. It disregards major facts which are of significant importance concerning this craft.

The craft observed on edge, and then 24 minutes later was again observed as a bright star-like object transiting slowly through uniform vapor or hazy somewhat brownish cloud layers. It showed no detail, or outline of any kind, but appeared as a brilliant star-like light source.

Its course was substantially level though its speed varied considerably. Occasionally dark linear masses were moving rapidly toward or away from the object, indicating dynamic forces at work apparently in the object itself.

I propose through this supplementary report to correct the failure of the previous report to adequately cover all significant observations of what in the light of this further information I believe was an unconventional craft of some kind.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

The text in the document is as follows:

"The illuminations lasted about two hours, and then the craft disappeared very rapidly into the darkness and out of sight.
I was greatly impressed, and felt 2 or 3 seconds the impression was receiving electrical pulses. I have told what at this craft revealed, as it seems the way some have occurred without my consent."

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object appeared to be travelling in a straight line and then suddenly disappeared, apparently out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something or into a cloud? (Circle one): (No)  Don't Know.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The match head would have covered approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the width of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
