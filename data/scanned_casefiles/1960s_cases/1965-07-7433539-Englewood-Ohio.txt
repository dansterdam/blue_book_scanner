On 14 Jul 6[illegible text] the Dayton Police Force called.

He felt that we might be interested in what he had observed the night before (13 Jul 65) in hopes that it would help solve some of our cases.

He was out on his patio interested in the moon, had binoculars, one light going North then went East, same magnitude as a ♂ satellite, but he was convinced it was a jet, sighting occurred around 8pm. He could hear sound of a jet that would be at high altitude, jet engines sound was very faint, at extreme height, possibly 40,000 ft. He was convinced it was a jet.

Observation took place at Englewood, Ohio out in the country.
