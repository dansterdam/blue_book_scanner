The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observation made in Englewood, Ohio. The text states that the observer, who was out on his patio interested in the moon and had binoculars, saw a light moving north then east, similar in magnitude to a satellite. The observer then saw a jet-like object that was at a high altitude, possibly around 40,000 feet, and was convinced it was a jet.

Text extracted from the document:
