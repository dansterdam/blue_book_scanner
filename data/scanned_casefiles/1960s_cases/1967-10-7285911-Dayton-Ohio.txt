11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted a total of about 50 objects that looked like fish with a tail. They were red, green, and some multicolor and were traveling from south to north. The objects were scattered and some were tumbling.

COMMENTS: The wind from the surface to 6000 ft was from an azimuth of 140 deg or was blowing toward about NNW. A letter was written to the Dayton Chamber of Commerce to see if these were balloons that could have been connected with Cleaner Air Week or perhaps the Ringling Brothers Circus but no answer was received.

Dayton, Ohio 45402

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report of October 22, 1967 from Dayton, Ohio, which occurred at approximately 6:00 to 6:30 pm. The observers state that about thirty, minus various colored objects passed over the witnesses' home. The majority of these objects appeared to be fish-shaped. The witnesses state that they observed between thirteen and fifteen, or these objects.

2. Request information on whether there were any balloon launches in the Dayton area on or near this time. Could these objects (balloons?) have been connected with Cleaner Air Week or perhaps the Ringling Brothers Circus?
