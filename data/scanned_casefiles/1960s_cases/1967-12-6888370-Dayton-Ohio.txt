it appeared as a very bright light, almost blinding, which changed dimensions and shape frequently. at first it looked small and round, then it elongated and became brighter, then contracted again. the brightness varied greatly, from very bright to dimmer. at no time was the object solid or well-defined. it appeared to be self-luminous rather than reflected light. there were no definite colors, but the light was white-bluish in tone. the movement was such that it did not resemble any known objects. there was no sound associated with the object.

SIGHTING INFORMATION:
My objective reaction was one of real mystery and awe. The object was approximately 3 feet in diameter, an 1 to 1.5 feet thick. It was brilliantly lighted, and seemed to be revolving slowly around a horizontal axis. It was virtually silent and appeared to be located about 300 feet above the ground. I watched it for approximately 5 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. It is obvious that what I saw does not fit into any conventional explanation. Although I am not claiming it was an extraterrestrial craft, I do feel I saw something highly unusual which deserves further study and investigation.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with handwritten text on it.

INFORMATION WHICH MAY HAVE ANY BEARING OR RELATION TO THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IS NOT ACCURATELY CONVEYED IN THIS COMMUNICATION.

The text appears to be a detailed first-hand account of a UFO sighting, describing the object's appearance, movement, and the witness's reactions. The text mentions the object being "bright" and "ball-shaped," and that the witness felt "very upset and nervous" while observing it. The text also discusses possible explanations or theories about the nature of the object, but ultimately concludes that it was not something identifiable.

The image contains two illustrations. The one on the left is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. The text below it describes how this diagram is used to schematically show the movement of the observed phenomenon between 4:45 and 5:15. 

The image on the right contains two sketches. The larger one depicts a human figure standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background. The smaller one shows a lighthouse-like structure against a scenic landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "0". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT ORIGINATED TO SOUTHEAST, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAGGED, ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS DESCRIPTION.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJ: UFO Observation, 24 December 1958
On 14 March 1959 Mrs. *****, Dayton, Ohio, 45405, phone *****, called to inform us that she had observed an unidentified object on 24 December 1958 at approximately 5:30 or 5:45 am. She wanted to know if we had received any other reports for this date. Explained to Mrs. ****** that are filing equipment was being repaired at present and that we would check into this on Monday, 16 March. Mrs. ****** said she wanted to report her observation, however, some of her friends said to and others said not to because she might be laughed at. I assured Mrs. ***** that we do not laugh at witnesses and also that same would not be released to the newspapers. Mrs. ****** then described her observation.
She saw a bright light, comparable to the north star. She saw the object first through her window and watched it for a long time remembering that it was the day before Christmas and the story of the bright star. The huge star all of a sudden came down, like it was descending towards the earth, then it went back to the same place and then it moved slowly across the sky. Mrs. ****** took time to go outside and watch it for it intrigued her. When asked the total duration of the sighting she said it must have been a long time about three or four seconds. When asked the second time about the time, she again repeated three or four seconds. Mrs. ****** compared the brightness to the bright north star. Mrs. ****** said she was not sure of her directions and thought maybe be it was in the northeast or north but said she couldn't tell directions very well. Will forward AF Forms 117 to her to complete, however, I did inform Mrs. ****** that we may not be able to make an identification since it was a brief sighting.
