As Received by Duty Officer, observer saw a nebula-like object traveling in a counterclockwise circle centered on observer at 45 deg elevation. Observer said object looked like pattern made by a searchlight on cloud bases but said it couldn't be a searchlight because the sky condition was clear. Object was been visible for 50 minutes at the time of the call and was still visible.

SUBJECT WAS IN LARGE BACK YARD AT OWN RESIDENCE. NERVOUS BEHAVIOR OF HER DOG (CO. RD. HOUND) CAUSED HER TO LOOK AROUND & NOTICE SUBJECT. DESCRIBED IT AS A NEBULA-LIKE LIGHT TRAVELING IN A COUNTER CLOCKWISE CIRCLE CENTERED ON SUBJECT AT 45° ELEVATION, MAKING ONE CIRCLE EVERY 4 SECONDS. SUBJECT SAID OBJECT LOOKED LIKE PATTERN MADE BY A SEARCHLIGHT ON CLOUD BASES BUT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A SEARCHLIGHT BECAUSE SKY CONDITION WAS CLEAR. PATTERSON WAS REPORTING 12,000 OVERCAST, DAYTON REPORTED 6000 OVERCAST, SOME BROKEN 12 CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM 8235; CLOUDS OBSERVED WERE STRATIFORM & SOMEWHAT THIN & A SEARCHLIGHT WAS OPERATING IN FAIRBORN BUT THIS IS ABOUT 12 MILES FROM SUBJECT'S RESIDENCE. SOME OF THE CLOUDS OBSERVED FROM 8235 SEEMED THIN CLOUDS TO SEE STARS THROUGH WHILE STILL FORMING A BRIGHT SPOT WHEN HIT BY A SEARCHLIGHT. SUBJECT MADE A SECOND CALL AT 2100 & REPORTED THE OBJECT WAS STILL VISIBLE AND WAS BREAKING INTO 2 OBJECTS DURING PART OF THE CIRCLE, THEN REJOINING.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                     14 March 1968

Subj: UFO Observation, 24 December 1968

On 14 March 1968 Mrs. [redacted], Dayton, Ohio, 45406, phone [redacted] called to inform us that she had observed an unidentified object on 24 December 1968 at approximately 530 or 545 am. She wanted to know if we had received any other reports for this date. Explained to Mrs. [redacted] that are filing equipment was being repaired at present and that we would check into this on Monday, 18 March. Mrs. [redacted] she wanted to report her observation, however, some of her friends said to and others said not to because she might be laughed at. I assured Mrs. [redacted] that we do not laugh at witnesses and also her name would not be released to the newspaper. Mrs. [redacted] then described her observation.

She saw a bright light, comparable to the north star. She saw the object first through her window and watched it for a long time remembering that it was the day before Christmas and the story of the bright star. The huge star all of a sudden came down, like it was coming towards the earth, then it went back to the same place and then it moved slowly across the sky. Mrs. [redacted] took time to go outside and watch it for it intrigued her. When asked the total duration of the sighting she said it must have been a long time about three or four seconds. When asked the second time about the time, she again repeated three or four seconds. Mrs. [redacted] compared the brightness to the bright north star. Mrs. [redacted] said she was not sure of her directions and thought may be it was in the northwest or north but said she couldn't tell directions very well. Will forward AF Forms 117 to her to complete, however, I did inform Mrs. [redacted] that we may not be able to positively identify.

her observation due to the length of time that has passed. I told
her that reports are best when they are made the same day, day
to later, or within the same week. We will also inform Mrs.
whether we received any other reports for 24 Dec.
