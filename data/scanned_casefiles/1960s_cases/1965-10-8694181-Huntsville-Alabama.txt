10. CONCLUSION
Astro (METEOR) ? Case -

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was described as a jinking spot of light, moving across the zenith with rather incredible speed. A pared glowing white light, rather than as an illuminated object. It crossed from about ten deg azth the zenith to clearance at 45 deg below the zenith due North, within 5-10 seconds. Object seemed to have tail spheres. It was overrun on a tail path and generally an unusual combination of natural illumination of a jet's afterburner flame.

Dear Sir:

A recent experience of mine produced a phenomenon of vision that seemed quite unusual, and I am writing you to make you aware of what, to me, at least, is a new facet of visual observation.

At about ten o'clock on Sunday morning, October 10, 1965, we were experiencing a particularly clear day here in Huntsville. The sky was cloudless and of a particularly intense blue associated with superior visibility. The inevitable trace of haze between my home and Monte Sano, several miles away, was near vanishing.

I trained in the antiaircraft artillery before and during World War II, and became addicted to visually fixing on any plane I could hear and identifying it. We have some traffic in the air here, and what I assume to be "the Cuba Patrol" flies overhead, sometimes daily. We also have visiting astronauts from Houston coming in occasionally, and they fly the high performance craft.

Also, I have had continuing interests in optics and acoustics, and think of these attempts for a quick fix and identification as problems in these fields.

At the time mentioned, the sound of a high-flying jet came into being at about forty five degrees elevation, due south. I attempted to sense some change in position and look ahead to pick up the plane visually. This often fails with jets which often can be heard farther than they can be seen, here.

The significant thing is, that I did indeed, fix visually on a moving point that had rather extraordinary characteristics. I saw what is best described as the equivalent of a jinking spot of light, moving across the zenith with rather incredible speed. It was at the very fringe of visibility, and appeared as a glowing white light. Rather than as an illuminated object. It seemed to cross from about ten degrees past the zenith to vanish at forty five degrees below the zenith due North of here, within five to ten seconds. There was no sonic boom, yet the apparent altitude and the seemingly high speed seemed to have involved supersonic flight. I have seen many Mach 6 flights of the Ajax missiles, while at White Sands Proving Ground, and I have some feel for a speed and altitude of high flying aircraft. I would say this craft led the apparent direction of its sound by something like forty degrees or more.

What I wish to offer, is the particularly unusual nature of the visual image. As I said, the plane appeared as a point of light, and seemed to have some unusual "tail feathered" and my first reaction was that I looked exactly as an incandescent gnat, would, jinking along overhead on a fast and generally straight course.

I would offer as explanation of the jinking motion, that I was seeing at the very limits of visibility, having located the plane almost purely by accident, it would seem, and that at this level of visibility, the servo loop, so to speak, between retinal signals and directing muscles was receiving signals down in the noise level thus producing the jumpy motion in the eye itself, something really not possible in the plane.

The apparent incandescence of the gnat-sized body can only be explained as an unusual combination of natural illumination of a reflecting body, with or without the reinforcement of illumination from the jet of a bright afterburner flame.

The combination of circumstances producing this unusual sighting may not be too rare, and the analysis I have offered and further analysis which you may make, may offer further insight into other sightings.

Sincerely yours,
LtCol USA(Ret)
