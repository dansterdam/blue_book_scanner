February 9, 1962

St. Thomas, Virgin Islands

Dear Mr. [redacted]

We appreciate the interest which prompted the submittal of your letter of December 5, 1961, in which you report certain observations as 3F50 PBL Standard Time. We assume that the date of these observations was December 6, the date of your letter.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration does not have the assignment or the facilities to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects. We have therefore forwarded your letter to the Department of the Air Force, which has the primary responsibility for investigating this type of observation. We wish to thank you again for your interest.

Sincerely yours,

James A. Kostiuk
