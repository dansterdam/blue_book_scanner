The text on this page is partially illegible. I can make out some words and phrases, but not the entire document clearly. Here's what I can discern:

First line appears to start with "9 pm flat..."

Some words I can partially read include:
- "9th"
- "received"
- "will"
- "ATB"

The bottom of the document has a word that looks like "Signed" but the rest is blacked out or redacted.

The document appears to be a typewritten or handwritten report with multiple holes punched on the left side of the page, typical of a file document from that era.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Nov. 29, 1968

Dear

The U.S. Air Force Recruiting Office in Hickory has forwarded your report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) to this office.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book we are enclosing.

Sincerely,
/s/
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

1. The attached letter was received by the U.S. Air Force Recruiting Office in Hickory, North Carolina on 25 November 1968 and was forwarded to this headquarters. The letter appears to be genuine in that the youngster who wrote it is concerned about what he believes to be an unidentified flying object.

2. We have taken no further action in this matter other than to acknowledge receipt of the letter and to forward it to your office for want of any information as to where else to send reports of this nature. Should any further action be required of this office, please advise.
