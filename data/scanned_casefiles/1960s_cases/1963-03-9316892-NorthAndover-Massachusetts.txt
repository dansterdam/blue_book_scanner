Department of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

At approximately 3:45 today, Sunday, I spotted three bright objects traveling in an east-north-easterly direction here in North Andover. The objects were circulating each other and passing each other. I saw them only for about a minute then suddenly they vanished. I'd say they were at an approximate height of three miles and traveling at an approximate 1,000 miles an hour.

Yours truly,

Case 14: The committee generally disagrees with classifying this as unreliable just because it was 14 years old. Although report does not inspire confidence, the committee feels that proper classification is insufficient information or insufficient follow-up.
