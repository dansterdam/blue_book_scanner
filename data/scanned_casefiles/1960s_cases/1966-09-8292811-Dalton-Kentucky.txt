The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text document with a title "REPORT OF SIGHTING OF FLYING SAUCER" and a written report describing an alleged sighting of a flying object by a young boy in Dalton, Kentucky in 1966.

The text of the document is as follows:

REPORT OF SIGHTING OF "FLYING SAUCER"

The witness, a 7-year old boy, but rather a ton year old boy, but rather intelligent, at Dalton, Route 2, Caldwell County, called at the office of Civil Defense, Caldwell County, as per request, accompanied by his mother, to make a personal report on the sighting of a somewhat airborne, in Caldwell County. On September 2, 1966, about 6 PM, while the boy was playing alone on a rural road, he heard a noise overhead which he described as something between the noise of a jet airplane and a buzz saw, circular in motion. 

He was unable to estimate the altitude of the object as it was difficult to the naked eye due to the setting sun lighting conditions. 

The object approached him, slowed down and hovered a few seconds, then started off in a direction ahead of him, at an angle. From the rear of the object he observed what appeared like contrails follow the glow in a furnace. The object disappeared rapidly from sight.

The boy stated he was scared to death, and his statement was quite hysterical when he arrived home later.

September 28, 1966

Respectfully submitted,
David L. Garnick, Director, Civil Defense

Frankfort, Kentucky

Dear Col. Reed:

Inclosed please find a report of a so-called "Saucer", sighted in Caldwell County on "September 9, 1966". It is my understanding that the investigates such reports, and for that reason I have referred this 15 year old boy and his mother call at the office with the statement - I assume you will know to whom, if the report should be sent.

I may add, that the Sheriff of Caldwell County saw the object, but his sketches of the object A satellite returning to earth from its orbit would upon entering the earth's atmosphere, but, that is an amateur's conjecture.

With kind personal regards, I am

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 23 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your reaction.

I am enclosing a narrative which I hope covers the information you require. As you can see from the description, there was quite a brilliant light which appeared to move around in the sky and was observed by several people. The object also seemed to be giving off a steady glow and did not appear to have any wings or appendages. At one point it hovered over the highway and the witnesses believe they saw some type of opening or hatch on the underside of the object. The object then shot off at a very high rate of speed. The witnesses were quite shaken by the experience and felt that what they saw was some type of unidentified flying object. I hope this narrative provides the information you need. Please let me know if you require any additional details.
