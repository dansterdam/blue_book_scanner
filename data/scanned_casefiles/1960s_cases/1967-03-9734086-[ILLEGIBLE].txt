11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
     The case is rather difficult to solve since there is no data in the file to indicate the nature of the objects photographed. The photos appear to show some type of aircraft or UFO, but without any other information it is impossible to determine what was actually photographed. More data would be required to make a proper analysis.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The first photograph shows a plus-shaped image with an additional, shorter crossbar to the right of center. Microscopic examination of this image reveals several features, including a "bell-shaped" trailing feature, a crossbar at the upper end of the vertical, and wider images at the tips than at the center of the horizontal crossbar, which is "not being 'stopped' by the camera shutter speed".

The second, less distinct photograph shows an aircraft-like object, with a "wing-shaped configuration" and "wing-like protrusions". A darker pattern, probably smoke or moisture, is visible. The letter also mentions various statements regarding helicopter activity.

Wright-Patterson-Maj Rademacher/SAFOICC/1J3/79C79/21 AUG 67

Dear Mr. ________________

Reference your correspondence regarding an observation and photographs of an unidentified flying object (UFO), examination of your negative reveals that such object photographed appears to be:

(1) The first photograph shows a plus-shaped image with an additional, shorter crossbar to the right of center. Microscopic examination of this image reveals several features:
a. A "bell-shaped" trailing feature
b. A crossbar at the upper end of the vertical
c. Wider images at the tips than at the center of the horizontal crossbar, which is "not being 'stopped' by the camera shutter speed"

(2) The second, less distinct photograph shows an aircraft-like object, with a "wing-shaped configuration" and "wing-like protrusions". A darker pattern, probably smoke or moisture, is visible.

(3) Various statements in your letter also suggest helicopter activity. They mention:
a. Erratic vertical movements
b. Very slow speed
c. Hovering for a 10-15-minute period

(4) The second, less distinct photograph shows an aircraft-like object, with a "wing-shaped configuration" and "wing-like protrusions". A darker pattern, probably smoke or moisture, is visible. A lower-wingend configuration, giving the appearance of a slight reduction in brightness, is visible. A darker pattern, probably the result of smoke or moisture, is visible.

Your two enclosures are returned.

The image appears to be a photograph depicting a blurry, indistinct object in the sky, which could be interpreted as a potential unidentified flying object (UFO). The image is somewhat grainy and obscured, with an apparent partially obstructed view of the sky and horizon. There is no human figure or other distinct identifiable elements in the photograph.

Sirs,

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO on the evening of March 31, 1967. It was a Friday night and every Friday/Saturday night I go outside with my telescope and binoculars to watch planes, etc. This particular night I was with my brother and sister who are both 12 yrs old. We were sitting down when my brother spotted a red light coming in very low (at tree top level). It must have been about one mile away. We just took it as another plane coming over, because about every 5 minutes a plane passes overhead. Then all of a sudden we noticed some strange movement. It was from the craft itself. It made a 90 degree turn (like the first of many). It came almost directly over our house. I looked at it with my binoculars and I saw that it was a cigar-shaped thing with a red light in the back, and the back it had a green light. It didn't make any sound whatsoever. Then we saw a jet come over and the thing started to follow the jet. The jet seemed to put on a burst of speed and the thing followed the jet.

AND OBJECT CARE OF THE SORT OF CHASE. I THEN TOLD MY SISTER TO GO IN AND GET HER CAMERA WHICH IS A HAWKEYE BY KODAK.

WE HAD A STAR LIGHT SET UP AND MY BROTHER TURNED IT ON AND I TOOK THREE PICTURES. THE PICTURES FAILED TO COME OUT BECAUSE OF POOR LIGHTING. BY THIS TIME THE KIDS FROM ACROSS THE STREET CAME OVER AND SAW THE OBJECT. I WON'T MENTION ANY NAMES THOUGH. MY FATHER WAS OUT SHOPPING AND MY MOTHER WAS IN A WHEEL CHAIR WITH MS. SO THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING. THE OBJECT MOST HAVE BEEN GOING VERY VERY SLOW, NEVER VERY VERY FAST, WHICH IS SLOW FOR AN AIRPLANE, AND IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER BECAUSE OF NO SOUND. THE THING WAS AT ABOUT 7:20 PM. I AM ENCLOSING 2 NEGATIVES FROM THE I TOOK. THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED THEM ONLY COULD GET NEGATIVES BUT NOT PICTURES. IF YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THE AREA NEGATIVES PLEASE LET ME KNOW ON THE NEXT PAGE I WILL REVIEW EVENTS.

The image contains a photograph that shows an aircraft approaching camera position, moving from right to left direction. The aircraft has a low-winged configuration that is visible. The photo analysis report states that this is the second, less distinct photograph, and that the aircraft configuration suggests it is similar to the T-39 Sabreliner used by the Air Force.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-55 . DATED 5 JULY 1967, Page 2

b. The second, less distinct photograph, shows an aircraft approaching camera position, moving in right to left direction. A low-winged configuration is visible. Indications are that this could be an aircraft similar to the T-39 Sabreliner used by the Air Force, all of which suggests an aircraft configured similar to the T-39 Sabreliner used by the Air Force.

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS - BERNARDFIELD, NEW JERSEY

1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-57 from Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., for the identification of objects/images as observed on the submitted negatives.

2. ANALYSIS: Each negative shows an object was photographed and each object appears to be an aircraft in flight.

a. The first photograph shows a plus-shaped image with an additional, shorter crossbar to the right of center. Microscopic examination of this image reveals several features:
 
(1) Less dense imagery at the upper end of the vertical crossbar suggests a tail rotor.
(2) Wider imagery at the tips than at the center of the horizontal crossbar is indicative of the main rotor not being "stopped" by the camera shutter speed.
(3) Only the starboard "flotation-type" landing gear being visible due to the under-side rear angle of photography.
(4) Numerous statements in the accompanying letter that also suggest helicopter 33571/27 are:
- Numerous vertical movements... 
- Cycle-shaped...
- Very slow speed...
- Being visible for a 15 minute period...

The image appears to show a black and white photograph of a night sky with some indistinct shapes or objects visible. There is a dark silhouette of what looks like trees or branches in the foreground. The image is grainy and somewhat obscured, making it difficult to make out any clear details.

MEMO for the Record: 9 March 67
Received a call from Mrs. [REDACTED], with regard to a report of a sighting of a UFO by various persons in the 983-2692 area code. After having a discussion with her, she asked to send the additional information to be recorded.
Contact with her revealed that her wife had heard a funny noise like the sound of something crunching on the radio. This sound went up and down for about 1 minute, then woke her husband at 0:00 AM. The object was described as large and white. He said that they couldn't confirm that the object was as large as it seemed on the radio. Other people could hear the sound but didn't see the object. It was asked to describe the object, and they said it was white and lights, but they weren't sure if the lights were blinking. It was asked to provide the address, but only a phone number in the 983-2692 area code was provided. He works at Station [REDACTED].
