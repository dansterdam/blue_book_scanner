Dear Sirs,

One night a show was just coming on to the. my brother was looking out. the windows. He has told me to take out the windows. I saw what I thought was a flying saucer.

At that same time my T.V. went nuts. I got my camera and took a picture of it. when it was white, I was so excited I didn't take a picture surface. (B&W BLACK AND WHITE FILM.)

It went over my house, and started to pick up some speed. That was the last I saw of it.

Blurry PG spotted with light object toward town. Taken when car at road to send as might see in one. There is some act though. Approx 20-25 ft. at 12 o'clock. It was a green light. It was not military type.

The pictures were taken apparently at different days. Supposed to be of the same object. Photo determined one object to be a helicopter or one conventional aircraft.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]

AUG 21 1967

Reference your correspondence regarding an observation and photographs of an unidentified flying object (UFO), examination of your negatives reveals that each object photographed appears to be an aircraft in flight.

(1) The first photograph above a plus-shaped image with an additional, shorter crossbar to the right of center. Microscopic examination of this image reveals several features of a helicopter in receding flight.

(a) Less dense imagery at the upper end of the vertical crossbar suggests a tail rotor.

(b) Wider imagery at the tips than at the center of the horizontal crossbar is indicative of the main rotor not being "stopped" by the camera shutter speed.

(c) Only the starboard "flotation-type" landing gear being visible because of the under left side rear angle of photography.

(d) Various statements in your letter also suggest helicopter activity. They were:

1. Numerous vertical movements.....
2. Clear-shaped.....
3. Very slow speed.....
4. Being visible for a 15-minute period.....

(2) The second, less distinct photograph, shows an aircraft appearing camera position, moving in right-to-left direction. A low-winged configuration is visible. A darker pattern, probably smoke, can be seen trailing the aircraft. A darker area on the upper side, less anti-glare area in front of the windshield. All of this suggests an aircraft configured similarly to the F-39 Sabreliner used by the Air Force.

Your two negatives are enclosed.

Photos being made.                                                APRIL 7, 1967

SIRS,

I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THE SIGHTING OF A UFO. ON THE EVENING OF MARCH 31, 1967. IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT AND EVERY FRIDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT I GO OUTSIDE WITH MY TELESCOPE AND BINOCULARS TO WATCH PLANETS, ETC.

THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT I WAS WITH MY BROTHER AND SISTER WHO ARE BOTH 12 YRS OLD. WE WERE SITTING DOWN WHEN MY BROTHER SPOTTED A RED LIGHT COMING IN VERY LOW (AT TREE TOP LEVEL). IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT ONE MILE AWAY. WE JUST TOOK IT AS ANOTHER PLANE COMING OVER, BECAUSE ABOUT EVERY 5 MINUTES A PLANE PASSES OVERHEAD.

THEN ALMOF A SUDDEN WE NOTICED SOME STRANGE MOVEMENTS FROM THE CRAFT. IT STARTED GOING UP AND DOWN IN EXTRAORDINARY FASHION. THEN IT MADE A 90 DEGREE TURN (THE FIRST OF MANY). IT CAME ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER OUR HOUSE. I LOOKED AT IT WITH MY BINOCULARS AND I SAW THAT IT WAS A CIGAR-SHAPED THING WITH A RED LIGHT IN THE BACK AND IN THE BACK IT HAD A GREEN LIGHT. IT DON'T MAKE ANY SOUND WHATSOEVER. THEN WE SAW A JET COME OVER AND THE THING STARTED TO FOLLOW THE JET. THE JET SEEMED TO PUT ON A BURST OF SPEED

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Wife heard a strange sound and looked out of the bedroom. She saw a saucer like craft travel toward Lake Michigan. After watching it for two to 10 minutes into wave motion. The craft was as big as a grey-hound bus. One witness only saw the object over a lake. Finally another object met the first over the lake and the two moved to the west. Other reports were noted during this time and stated by two witnesses; however, they only involved a bright white light.

Case is being carried as unidentified in the Air Force files.

AND OBJECT GAVE UP THE SORT OF CHASE. I THEN
TOLD MY SISTER TO GO IN AND GET HER
CAMERA WHICH IS A HAWKEYE BY KODAK.
WE HAD A SPOT HIGHT SET UP AND MY BROTHER
TURNED IT ON AND I TOOK THREE PICTURES.
THE PICTURES FAILED TO COME OUT BECAUSE OF
POOR LIGHTING. BY THIS TIME THE KIDS
FROM ACROSS THE STREET CAME OVER AND
SAW THE OBJECT. I WON'T MENTION ANY NAMES
THOUGHT. MY FATHER WAS OUT SHOPPING
AND MY MOTHER IS IN A WHEEL CHAIR
WITH MS. SO THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
THE OBJECT MUST HAVE BEEN IN SIGHT FOR 15
MINUTES. IT WAS GOING VERY VERY SLOW,
MUCH TO SLOW FOR AN AIRPLANE, AND IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER BECAUSE OF
NO SOUND. THE THING WAS AT ABOUT
7:20 PM. I AM ENCLOSING 2 NEGATIVES
FROM THE I TOOK. THE COMPANY THAT
DEVELOPED THEM ONLY COULD GET
NEGATIVES BUT NOT PICTURES. IF YOU
CAN DO ANY THING WITH THE NEGATIVES
PLEASE LET ME KNOW ON THE NEXT

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-55, DATED 5 July 1967, Page 2

b. The second, less distinct photograph, shows an aircraft approaching camera position, moving in right to left direction. A low-winged configuration is visible. A darker pattern, probably smoke, can be seen trailing the aircraft. A darker area on the upper side left end is probably the anti-glare area in front of the windshield. All of which suggests an aircraft configured similar to the T-39 Sabreliner used by the Air Force.

2. ANALYSIS: Each negative shows an object was photographed and each object appears

a. The first photograph shows a plus-shaped image with an additional, shorter
crossbar to the right of center. Microscopic examination of this image reveals
several features of a helicopter in receding flight.

(1) Less dense imagery at the upper end of the vertical crossbar suggests
a tail rotor.

(2) Wider imagery, at the tips than at the center, of the horizontal
crossbar is indicative of the main rotor not being "stopped" by the camera shutter
speed.

(3) Only the starboard "flotation-type" landing gear being visible due
to the under left side rear angle of photography.

(4) Numerous statements in the accompanying letter that also suggest
helicopter activity are:

Numerous vertical movements...
Cigar-shaped...
Very slow speed...
Being visible for a 15 minute period...
