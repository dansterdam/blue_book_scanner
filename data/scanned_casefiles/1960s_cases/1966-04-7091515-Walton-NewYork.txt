Dear Mrs.

Your letter of 26 April 1966 to Governor Rockefeller has been referred to our office for evaluation. The event which you described in your letter was indeed the observation of a brilliant meteor. This event was witnessed by many citizens throughout the eastern part of the United States. The meteor was also photographed and it must have been a beautiful sight to see. You have been a witness to a rare phenomena which very few people ever get to see.

I am enclosing copies of photos of similar events, but your meteor must have been much prettier than those which have been photographed in the past. Thank you for your interest in reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

Dear Mr. Rockefeller:

I have been reading a lot about objects that have been cited in the sky. In one specific paper it seemed every city in to respect much information quite to a specific department of the federal Government. It also gave the name of the man while head said department. I didn't think I ever would have any use of the valuable information but I throw World you kindly forward this information to that department?

Last night 4-25-66, still day-light approximately 8:00 P.m. day-light savings, I called on a girl friend, a witness to this information. We started out of her

Thinking was bright in front turning read had the whole thing getting dimmer, it seemed to us it was going out falling to earth, we know not where. What was it? A meteor does not have a trail of smoke after it.
