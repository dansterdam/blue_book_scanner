SUMMARY: (Give gist of report, the disposition or final action. See paragraph, last line of reverse for additional instructions. See page II for Part II)

I am, in doubt whether to call my sighting an object, an airplane explosion. However, I will assume the sighting was on object before it exploded.

a. Description:
(1) Fireball first, and then a large portion of sky was lit up as if an explosion had occurred. There was considerable orange and some blue coloring
(2) Fireball was basketball size
(3) Fireball was brilliant white. It resembled a strong spotlight.
(4) Only one.
(5) Only one.
(6) My first impression was that a large landing light had been turned on in my face.
(7) No tail visible to me.
(8) No sound. I was flying in a T-33 aircraft.

b. Description of object:
(1) The intense light which appeared to be approaching rapidly. My first thought was that I was about to collide with something and I initiated evasive maneuvers.
(2) Object appeared level with me.
(3) Object was in my nine o'clock, and my magnetic heading was 250°. My altitude was 35,000 feet, my ground speed 350.
(4) Appeared to be gaining altitude.
(5) The sequence was this: brilliant white, fireball; then a brilliant colorful explosion (which silhouetted the cloud tops), and returned to darkness.
(6) Approximately five seconds.

And this was only a beginning—for on January 15, 1961 a so-called meteor flashed across the sky in southern Oregon and northern California, lighting up Eureka, California almost like daylight.
