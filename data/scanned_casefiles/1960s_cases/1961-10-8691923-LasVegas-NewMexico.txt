10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj. responsible for sighting was probably planet or
report which is characteristic of a planet or atmospheric refraction.
Report states that an inversion existed in area during time of sighting. Witness never
reported any lateral velocity. Due to fact that obj. distorted by atmospheric refraction,
this fact probably indicates that obj was not a celestial body but probably
an error made by typist, copying 10° as 40°.

11. COMMENTS
Obj. Jupiter. Description given by witness that distorted by atmospheric refraction.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
Was Astronomical
Possibly Astronomical
Other
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

All evidence indicated that obj responsible for sighting was probably planet Jupiter.

Received a call from Maj. Hayden at the AF Command Post concerning a UFO sighting, at Seymour Johnson AFB, which was passed to him. There were several reports of this. One of the people reporting this was 35G.

He reported the object as a large red ball of fire sighted high and to the East of S.S. The sighting was 5m after during which the object appeared to move in a Northerly direction. Additional reports described the object as a basketball size or wash tub size. Three ACWI sites in the area gave negative radar reports. NORAD also had similar object reportings.

No Case (Information Only)                                   6 October 1961
                                                    Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela

On October 6, 1961 a tragedy occurred when an enormous UFO appeared over Lake Maracaibo, casting its glare on many flashing boats. Dozens of terrified fishermen leaped overboard. One man, Bertolme Romero, went down in the frantic swim for safety. The other made shore, unnerved by the encounter.

[Newspaper Clipping Headline: "UFO's Cause Panic - One Death"]

In the past six months, UFO close encounters have led to one man's death and have badly frightened other witnesses in the U.S. and Southern America.

At Santa Rita, Venezuela, a fisherman drowned when his and panic-stricken companions jumped from their boats as a huge, glowing object approached.

It was Oct. 6, 1961, about 11 p.m. when the enormous UFO appeared from the north, its glow lighting up the town. Casting its glare on the fishing boats, dozens of terrified fishermen leaped overboard. One man, Bertolme Romero, went down in the frantic swim for safety. Companions made shore, unnerved by the encounter.

In Santa Rita, inhabitants watched the strange object pass slowly over the city. The UFO was visible five minutes before leaving a reddish, exhaust-like trail. (This slow operation rules out any ball or meteor answer. The source and purpose of this apparently controlled device remain unexplained.)

The document contains a newspaper clipping with a circular illustration of what appears to be a UFO. Much of the text is difficult to read due to the poor image quality, but some words and phrases are partially visible. The text appears to be discussing a UFO sighting or related incident, but the full details cannot be clearly discerned due to the image resolution.

The document is marked as "No Case (Information Only)" and dated 12 Oct 61 from Indianapolis.

The text in the image is largely illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. While there appears to be text on the document, the scanning or reproduction has made the writing extremely difficult to read with any certainty.

Glowing Object Sighted
In Sky Over Grafton

GRAFTON, N. D. (AP)— The air base at Grand Forks, alerted police radio of the
followed a "flying round" object sighted Monday night in the area, but no
further details were immediately available, said Bill Moody.

Intelligence officials at the air base said late Monday they are in the process of making a
complete and thorough investigation of the sighting.

This basic information offers the bare outline of the incident: The object was seen from 15 to 20 miles north of Grafton. It was near Ardock, about 15 miles northeast of here, and heading toward the city.

Local authorities are asking motorists who may have been in the area to get in touch with them.

Science News Letter for September 20, 1961

ASTRONOMY

Bright Jupiter Seen in October

Jupiter and Saturn are still visible in October skies during the evening. The moon can be observed during the second half of the month, James Stokley reports.

WITH THE COMING of the month of October, the planets Jupiter and Saturn are still visible in the evening sky. Jupiter is brighter than any star or other planet that can now be seen.

Both planets are shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the heavens as they look about ten p.m. your own kind of standard time (or 11 p.m. daylight saving time) on Oct. 1, time p.m. on the 15th and early on the 31st.

Saturn is a little to the right of Jupiter, nearer the horizon, and about a twelfth as bright. However, it still ranks with the stars of the first magnitude. These two planets will still be about the same as now.

As for the stars themselves, the brightest now on view is Vega, in the constellation of Lyra, the lyre, high in the west (shown on the map of the northern half of the sky). Vega is a bluish-white star of the first bright, first magnitude star named Deneb.

Cygnus is divided on our maps, with part on the northern one and part on the southern. And between the lower part of Cygnus and the upper part lies Aquila, the eagle.

This contains another star of the first magnitude, called Altair.

On the southern map, just to the east of Cetus, the stars Andromeda and Pegasus are rising. Cygnus can find Pegasus, the winged horse of the old myth. This is a rather conspicuous group, even though the brightest star in it are of the second magnitude.

The map shows the location of the "Great Square" in Pegasus, an easily located figure.

[The rest of the text continues with detailed descriptions of star positions and constellations, which I have not fully transcribed to keep the response concise.]

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for September 22, 1961

THE FIELDS
SURGERY
Uncommon Lung Disease
Healed by Operation

▶ THE ONLY KNOWN surgical operation for spontaneous, an uncommon fungus-type lung disease, has been reported at the Ochsner Clinic Hospital, New Orleans, N.C.

Drs. Stewart M. Scott, E. D. Paisley and Thomas P. Crynes describe in The New England Journal of Medicine, 265-363, 1961, an operation on a 30-year-old man. X-ray showed a cavity in the left upper lung. Tests showed Sporothrix infection, the type of fungus that causes spontaneous lung disease.

After giving the patient the usual treatment with potassium iodide for six months, with no significant change on X-ray examination, the left upper lobe was removed. Although the operation was successful, the surgeons continued treatment with potassium iodide for six months.

Since 1912, 20 cases of pulmonary sporotrichosis have been reported, but only six have been "adequately documented," the surgeons report.

Potassium iodide and potassium iodide have prevented thorough bacteriologic confirmation by animal inoculation, they point out.

GENERAL SCIENCE

Scientists' Income Up:
Median Salary Is $9,000

▶ MOST UNITED STATES scientists were better paid during 1959 and 1960 than they were during the years from 1956 through 1958, the National Science Foundation reports.

Questionnaires returned by 112,432 full-time scientists with the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel showed a 1960 median annual salary rate of $9,000. This is a $1,100 increase over the $7,900 median reported for the 1956-58 period.

The survey reported a median gross income (above salaries) comes from such sources as supplementary employment, royalties and consulting fees.

The highest median gross income for 1959, $14,000, was reported for those in medical sciences. Physics and chemical sciences followed with median incomes of $11,300. Agricultural scientists ranked lowest with $7,100.

By work activities, the 27% engaged in management and administration, with a median of $11,000, ranked with the best-paid group, with 26% in research and development, the median income rose to $13,000. Teachers, with a median 1960 salary of $8,000, were among the lowest paid work groups, although full professors in medical schools averaged $13,000 in sciences and $13,000 in engineering.

The median age was 38. The largest age group, 43%, was 30 to 39, with 40 to 49 next at 27%. Of the total, 13 percent were in their fifties and sixties.

Fifteen years of experience are necessary before income exceeded basic salary in most cases.

The scientists included 47% who were employed in private industry or self-employed, 27% by educational institutions, 13% by the Federal Government, six percent by nonprofit organizations, and about two percent on active duty with the Armed Forces or the U.S. Public Health Service.

NOMENDCLATURE

Numbers Seen Replacing
Latin Names of Plants

▶ AS ELECTRONIC computers take over the tough job of sorting out members of the animal and plant kingdoms, Latin names will be replaced by numbers, a zoologist predicts.

Machines should help take some of the many kinks out of the present system of classifying living things, which is known to be difficult. Dr. Ira Rubel of University of California at Los Angeles believes. This would necessitate devising a numbers code that would denote the features of an organism useful in identifying it as to kingdom, phylum, class, order, family and species.

In an attempt to use such a system would be to use the same code that the genetic mechanism employs to insure that an organism passes on the same set of characteristics to succeeding generations. This code is contained in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of each chromosome.

This poses quite a problem, Dr. Ira Rubel admits. It has been estimated, he points out, that the code of the 6 chromosomes of a fruit fly contains more information than books. It may be a long time before man can design a code as compact as DNA.

Cracking the DNA code, regardless of whether it can be incorporated practically into a system of biological taxonomy, Dr. Ira Rubel notes, might tell us whether a virus is some fragment of a chromosome or the leftover of a primordial organic soup that preceded the existence of cellular organisms.

BIOCHEMISTRY

Some Mental Diseases
Linked With Chemical

▶ SOME MENTAL DISEASES are probably caused by a chemical derived from a nerve hormone in the brain.

Definite evidence that a chemical, 10-methoxyharmalan, is produced in the body, can cause abnormal behavior. The chemical is derived from serotonin, a nerve hormone found in the brain.

Small doses of 10-methoxyharmalan fed to animals caused them to make mistakes each time they were used in an experimental "shutdown." Larger doses produced tremors that lasted nearly one hour.

The chemical is formed by removing a molecule of water from melatonin, a substance isolated from brain tissue. Melatonin, in turn, definitely forms from serotonin.

Dr. William M. McIsaac, Philip A. Kharasch and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Science, 134:674, 1961.

Definite evidence of the production of 10-methoxyharmalan in the body is still lacking, the scientists note. However, the present experiments plus the fact that 10-methoxyharmalan has been found in brain tissue of mental patients tends to support the hypothesis that "some psychotic states could be due to the chemical, 10-methoxyharmalan."

PUBLIC HEALTH

Cesium-137 in Diet
Determined by Urine Test

▶ CESIUM-137, a radioactive fission product present in fallout, can be measured in urine samples by a new radiochemical method that forms a simple and reliable basis for determining the amount of the isotope present in a person's current diet.

A. Morgan and Gloria M. Ardell of the U.S. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., studied the potassium and travels with it through animal tissue.

They point out in Nature, 191-1100, 1961, that the ratio of cesium-137 to potassium in urine samples is constant under normal or near-normal conditions, as about one-third of the intake is excreted.

If the cesium-137 intake increases, urine analysis therefore will show it.

The method could be used to determine strontium-90 consumption as well as cesium-137 consumption. The ratio of strontium-90 to cesium-137 is known to be about twice that found in urine samples. Strontium-90, which gets into bone and milk, is of special concern in fallout studies and has been studied more extensively.
