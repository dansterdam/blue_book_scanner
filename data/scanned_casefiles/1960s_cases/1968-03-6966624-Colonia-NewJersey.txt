Friday 29 Mar 68

Sent to men,

On Tuesday, Mar. 26,
at 9:15 PM, I saw what
I sincerely believe was
one of those U.S.O.'s.
The next day I heard on
the news that others had
been seen in the preceding two or three days.
Now, however, according
to other reports, had seen
quite as much as I saw.

This has been on my
mind, and bothering me
ever since and I would
like very much to talk
to someone about it.

I would, in like to
better you unnecessarily but
I can't help out think that
what I saw will be of
interest to you. If anyone is interested, I am -

over a 117
