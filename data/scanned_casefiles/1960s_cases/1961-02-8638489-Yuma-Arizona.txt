Memo (AFCIN-42), 19 Apr 61, Request for Review
1st Ind (AFCIN-481a/Mr. Bryant/Jc/74201)                9 May 61

TO:   AFCIN-42 (Maj Friend)

1.   The report dated 14 Apr 61 from Anderson AFB has insufficient information upon which to base an evaluation. For example, "Description of flight path and maneuvers of object" is indicated as "N/A", and range of the target is not given.

2.   Report dated 17 Feb 61 has been evaluated and evaluation indicates that considering speed of target, a reentry body (or meteoric) is about the only possibility if the target was real. The abnormally large size of the blip is not consistent with that type of target, however. Check should be made of cognizant agencies to determine if reentry body or meteoric activities were in area.

3.   Evaluation of report from 864th ACW Sq., Yuma, Ariz., dated 28 Feb 61, indicates chaff drop is most plausible explanation. Check of Air Force activities for possible chaff exercise could be made.

OF PREPARING OFFICER: POSITION TITLE: SENIOR DIRECTOR. WHEN THE
OBJECT WAS FIRST PICKED UP ON THE MPS-14, THE PRESENTATION APPEARED
THE SAME AS THAT OF A SINGLE AIRCRAFT. DUE TO THE SLOW SPEED, IT WAS
THOUGHT TO BE A BALLOON, HOWEVER, THE PRESENTATION BEGAN TO BREAK UP
AND BECAME DIFFUSED AT APPROXIMATELY 42,000 FEET. ALTHOUGH THE
OBJECT WAS MOVING AT ONLY 20 KNOTS, IT LEFT A TRAIL OF DIFFUSE ECHOES
EXTENDING BEHIND AND SLANTING DOWNWARD, SIMILAR TO A STREAM OF CHAFF.
THE RATE OF DESCEND WAS APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET PER MINUTE. THE ENTIRE
ECHO BECAME DIFFUSE AND DESCENDED AT THE ABOVE RATE UNTIL CONTACT
WAS LOST. THIS OFFICER DURING EIGHT YEARS EXPERIENCE IN AC&W DUTY
HAS NOT ENCOUNTERED A SIMILAR PRESENTATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
CHAFF DROPPED FROM BALLOONS IN ALASKA. L. NEGATIVE
