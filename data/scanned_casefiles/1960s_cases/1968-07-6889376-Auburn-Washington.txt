Proposed Statement for Release at McChord AFB, Washington

The following UFO sightings were submitted to the Air Force for evaluation from Auburn, Washington:

23 June - C000 hours, local
C140 " "
29 June - C020 hours, local
C200 " "
30 June - C040 hours, local
C220 " "
2315 " "

1 July - C050 hours, local
0240 " "
2330 " "
2 July - C010 hours, local
2340 " "

Because the sightings were of a moving star-like, point-source of light, the information was given to the Space Detection Center (SDC) to determine if a satellite could be the stimulus.

SDC ran a computer program using the above dates and times and determined that COSMOS 103 rocket body would be visible from Auburn at the above specific times. Therefore, it became apparent that this could be the stimulus of the sightings.

Project Blue Book will classify these sightings in the satellite category.

** If queried about the nature of Cosmos 103, the following statement is authorized:

Cosmos refers to a series of Soviet space research satellite launches. Cosmos 103 was launched on Dec 28, 1965, with an unannounced payload.

* Approved by OASD/PA as amended on 26 July 1968. Informed Lt Parker, Information Officer, McChord AFB, same day that he was authorized to release the above, informed Project Blue Book (Lt Novans) on 29 July of action taken.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTINGS FROM AUBURN, WASHINGTON

The following UFO sightings were submitted to the Air Force by an observer in Auburn, Washington.

                    0140 hrs   "

29 June 1968        0020 hrs local
                    0200 hrs   "

30 June 1968        0040 hrs local
                    0220 hrs   "
                    2315 hrs   "

2 July 1968         0110 hrs local
                    2340 hrs   "

Because the sightings were of a moving star-like point-source of light, the information was given to the Space Defense Center (SDC) to determine if a satellite could be the stimulus. SDC ran a computer program using the above dates and times and determined that Cosmos 103 Rocket Body would have been visible from Auburn at the above specified times. Therefore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that this rocket body is the stimulus for the sightings.
