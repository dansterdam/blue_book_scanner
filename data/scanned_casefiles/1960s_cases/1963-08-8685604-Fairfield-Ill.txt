SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION AT FAIRFIELD:
and   were driving east on Illinois Highway 15 at approximately 05002 hours on 5 August 1963. At this time they noticed a bright object in the sky to the right of their automobile. Observers were traveling in a valley of the road and approximately 30 yards from the highway transformer station. The object remained in a stationary position. Observers were near a Micro-Wave transmitting station. Object now appeared to change course from the right to the left of the car. While observers were still traveling, the object continued at the same elevation of approximately 15 degrees. Observers changed direction and were traveling north, the object appearing in the east at an elevation of 30 degrees. When the object arrived at Milne House, he went inside and stayed for about 15 minutes. From Milne's house, the object appeared in the east at an elevation of 15 degrees. On his way home, he observed the object appear at an elevation of 35 degrees as his car would go. During this time, the car sputtered and the radio started to crackle and stop playing. Almost immediately after it had begun to sputter, the car ran normally again and the radio ceased to crackle. The car was at this time being driven at its maximum speed on a gravel road. Upon reaching home, Mr.  immediately informed his father - the object seemed to hover over some trees which were about two hundred yards from the house. At this time the lights in the house were on.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The undersigned and the Deputy Sheriff of Fairfield, Illinois was notified. During the excitement, a bright diamond-shaped object and was given a directive to calm his nerves.

Deputy Sheriff Harry Lee of Wayne County, Marshall George Sexton of Wayne City and State Trooper Richard Gidcumb went to witness the phenomena. The area was extensively surrounding the farm is densely vegetated, and on the night the phenomena was observed a slight haze hung over the area. The three law enforcement officers observed the object for a period of time and Marshall Sexton concluded that the object was the "evening star". The officers observed the object for about a half hour and then left. One of his friends watched the object until daybreak. The object disappeared with the coming of daylight.

When the object disappeared, it was at an elevation of 45 degrees.

Returning to their home station, Marshall Sexton and State Trooper Gidcomb observed an object which appeared to be moving from west to east. The object appeared as a red light with exhaust flames and/or fiery streaks. The object disappeared after approximately four seconds.

On the evening of 7 August 1963 at approximately 02:05 hours, Mr. and Mrs. observed a bright diamond-shaped object in the sky. The object appeared to be about 50 to 75 feet in diameter, shaped like a diamond with a tail. The object first appeared in the south and traveled towards the east. Object traveled approximately 15 degrees."

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical US Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page does not contain any photographs, but rather text describing a UFO sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

Rapidly 30 degrees of the sky in 15 minutes. The object then appeared as two objects and one object traveled from the southeast to the northwest while the other object made a "U" turn and disappeared.

Conclusions:
It is the Air Force's opinion that Mr. [REDACTED] first saw through a slight haze while driving in the valley of the road by the Stafford Transformer Sub-Station. [REDACTED] continued to see the moon at the top of the valley near the micro-wave station however, at this time his attention was diverted to the left of his car and he focused his attention on Jupiter. He continued to see Jupiter for the rest of the evening. Marshall Sexton's conclusion that what Mr. [REDACTED] saw was in fact Jupiter.

The sighting reported by Marshall Sexton and State Trooper [REDACTED] was a meteor of the fireball class.
The sighting reported by Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] was an air-to-air refueling operation which took place in the immediate vicinity of Fairfield, Illinois.

The text of the document is as follows:

November 16, 1953 A.D.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
U.S.O. Laboratories
Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

I am writing this letter for two reasons, to give and to receive information. I want to report two unidentified flying objects which were sighted in Wayne County Illinois.

I was about 2 miles northwest of St. Elmo, Illinois, on Highway 33, on Saturday November 2, 1953 A.D. The time was approximately 6:15 p.m. Central Standard Time. The objects were about 25 degrees above the southwest horizon. They were visible for about 10 to 15 minutes. They were traveling in an undulating or oscillating motion, going up and down at irregular intervals. They did not blink or show any lights. The objects appeared to be metallic in color and were the size of a B-29 bomber. They were separated by about one half mile and showed no vapor trails.

As they passed overhead, I did not hear any sound. At one point, the compass in my car is unreliable. Not having any other instruments, I would say the object obtained a characteristic glow from it. We watch it for around 15 minutes until they passed out of sight.

Now I would like to know some things about the August 17, 1953, sightings in the Fairfield area. I will appreciate any information you can give me. However, I do not seem to have done such a good job in my observation as I would like. Therefore, I am turning to you.

Here is the text from the document, produced by OCR:

Finally, I would like to ask about the object turned over to you about October 31, 1963. 
a) What does the object appear to be made of?
b) What was the diameter/size of the object?
c) Have you obtained any samples of the object? 
d) What is the exact date the object was turned over to you?
e) Were there any remains of residuous compounds inside?
f) What was the color/shape of the object?
g) Does it have any characteristic symmetry or asymmetry?
Is this an object of a physical nature or do you consider it to be some type of energy field?
If it is a physical object, what are its properties as determined by your laboratory analysis? 
If it is an energy field, what are the characteristics of the radiation and/or field as determined by your instrumentation?
What radioactive count can be detected on the exterior than the interior? 
When this paragraph is my standard "Form" paragraph I always insert where stated "your name" and disregard the rest.
For security for the United States Government, I cannot give any specifics on the object as it may jeopardize national security.
I sincerely protected from civil disaster.
My sincere thanks for being of assistance to me. (T-H O P E)

REPLY TO ATTN OF: IDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: 1st USAF BAR-CIPF
WPAFB, D.C.

1. Reference the attached letter from Lt. Col. _______________ regarding information on unidentified flying objects.

2. Without taking a position, the eyewitness accounts in this letter relate to a meteor-type sighting. The objects, which a number of witnesses claim to have observed, allegedly depicted the following characteristics:

a. An apparent material decay, northeast or southeast.
b. Detaching characteristics by a breaking up of the object.
c. An apparently greater duration than a meteoric event.

3. The duration is much greater than a meteor sighting, for example, an estimated 27 minutes. The visual decay of 1960 was observed from Florida to Maine and lasted in excess of four minutes.

4. A case summary of the 1 Aug 1963 sighting in Fairfield, Illinois is attached. It should enable you to answer the questions raised by the attached letter.

a. At no time did the Air Force attempt to convince the witnesses that they had not observed something of significance. However, it is difficult to establish any facts which would substantiate or negate the sighting. This evaluation is based on lack of confirming evidence and/or objective data to support the contentions.

b. There are many reasons for station on a car radio, for example, a shifting forward or rearward radio association was established between the UFO and static in this case. However, it is difficult to evaluate or correlate such data in relation to this case.

c. There are no information regarding a "guiding sighting" in relation to this case.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing text describing various observations about an unidentified object.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

a. The object was found in the area. It was turned over to the officials from Brookfield, Ill. As described in paragraph 4 of the letter, the answers to questions in paragraph 4 of the letter are as follows:

b. It has never been in outer space.
c. Yes, we have blasted the objects.
d. The interior is made of silicon compounds.
e. No gold was present.
f. There were no remains of resinous compounds inside.
g. Yes, there were calcium and silicon compounds present.
h. No test was made to determine its specific gravity.
i. The exterior layer is iron pyrites, the interior or center is composed of CaCO3 + SiO2.
j. No answer.
k. The object was not radioactive.
l. Nothing in this letter is considered classified.

FOR THE COMMANDER

The shared image contains a photograph of a dark, disc-shaped object in the sky. The object appears to be a UFO sighting reported in an old Project Blue Book document.

December 6, 1963

Dear [Redacted],

Referring to your letter of November 15, 1963, we submit the following information:

1. The object was reportedly sighted and photographed at Fairfield, Illinois, at approximately 2:30 p.m. on December 5, 1963. Consistent with a photo of this type, the object has a slight curve on the bottom, a flat top and a dark clearly defined edge.

2. Pennant: All photographic images have an easterly orientation meaning that the object was moving from left to right or eastward.

3. Easy to characterize by a breaking up or the object being obscured.

4. Duration of sighting approximately 15 minutes, the object then disappeared from view.

5. A close examination of the object indicates that it was reflecting light from the cloud cover and shadows of the clouds on the object are distinctly visible.

A case summary of the August 4, 1963 sighting at Fairfield, Illinois indicates that these objects were once again observed moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed for over 3 minutes. On that occasion, our photograph was obtained showing the object as a clearly defined disc.

There are many reasons for static or a gap or radio problems that we cannot explain, but no evidence is found to substantiate any unusual radio or radar detections. The radio station information was made available only because it was the source of the original report.

This air force has no information regarding a location or description of the object sighted on the 5th of December.

b. It has never been in outer space.
c. Yes, we have bisected the object.
d. The interior is made of silicon compounds.
e. No gold was present.
f. There were no remains of radioactive compounds inside.
g. The object was made of silicon and silicon compounds pressed.
h. No test was made to determine its specific gravity.

My sincere congratulations on the reply to my recent inquiry. Although through the eyes of experienced investigators, it is obvious that this incident is no threat to the security and well-being of the nation, nevertheless it is frustrating to me imperatively, but I believe some points are worth considering.
I should like to add that there is just too much similarity between us "Sincerely yours," and you to continue to throw for a "loop" to learn that there was no gold in the object, which was determined from a natural occurrence.

Light Chases Youths
Two young men, 17 and 19, and their companion, 17, were driving along Illinois Route 37 south of their homes shortly after midnight on the morning of 5 August 1963. They reported seeing a bright light approaching them rapidly from behind. The sighting may have been the first of a series of unusual occurrences which happened to them.

As the light approached their car, it appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was brightly illuminated. It passed over the car and went back to its original position. The youths then noticed that their radio, which they had tuned in, went static and that the compass in the car was spinning about. They could not account for the time that had elapsed from the moment the light passed over the car and when they came to their normal senses. 

Approximately 15 minutes later, as they neared their homes, the light reappeared, this time to the south of them, and moved rapidly across the sky in a north-south direction, again passing near their car. This time the light seemed to be larger in size, about the size of a basketball, and was brighter. After it passed, the radio and compass once more functioned normally.

When the youths reached their homes, they immediately notified officials at a nearby Air Force intelligence unit. This was about 2:00 a.m. 5 August 1963. The Air Force officer who received the report stated that it was then that he realized that the party of observers had watched the flight path of the object from the time it first appeared until it disappeared. He immediately dispatched a patrol car to pick up the youths and bring them to the Air Force base for questioning.

The questioning revealed that the youths had driven to their homes, had entered the house, and had sat momentarily as though stunned or confused. They then went outside and saw the light in the south and called the Air Force intelligence unit. 

The youths were examined by the base medical officer and found to be in a normal physical condition. They stated that it was their impression that it was only a few minutes from the time the light first appeared until they reached their homes, although their watches indicated a lapse of about 15 minutes. They were also questioned concerning any unusual sensations they may have experienced, but they could recall nothing out of the ordinary other than the strange behavior of their radio and compass.

Later, when Air Force intelligence units and a physicist consulted the youths, it was explained to them that we were the unusual incidents. We will fill the Air Force officer in on the details, and request that they notify the authorities concerning their explanation.

UFO SIGHTING
FAIRFIELD, ILLINOIS
5 - 7 AUGUST 1963

On 6 August 1963 information was received at Wright-Patterson AFB that an unidentified flying object had been observed in Fairfield, Illinois. The information was essentially that carried over the news circuits. 

According to the girl friend of the man who saw the object - as she was coming home they were chased by a flying saucer and upon arriving home they were questioned by other members of the family. The object then proceeded to his own home while the saucer continued on its course. After a while it turned and came back toward the house and hovered over the house a short time, then proceeded on. The man called Harry Lee, the Deputy Sheriff of Fairfield, Illinois, is supposed to have been one of the eyewitnesses.

Scott AFB was contacted and requested to investigate the sighting under Project BLUE BOOK.

Information received from Scott AFB confirmed that the object besieging the farmhouse was indeed Jupiter. However, since the story was attracting national interest through the press media, and additional sightings were reported, an additional field investigation.

The following information is extracted from this report:

"On 5 August 1963 one or more observers were driving east on Illinois highway 15 at approximately 0500Z hours on 6 August 1963. At this time they noticed a bright object at approximately 40 degrees elevation to the west of their position. The object remained stationary for some 15 to 20 minutes. Another approach was made towards the object and it was now observed at an elevation of 15 degrees while observers were still travelling east. Object now began transmitting light signals. Object was next observed at an elevation of 30 degrees with observers having completed approximately 15 miles of travel. Object appeared in the east at an elevation of approximately 15 degrees and driving observers changed direction and continued to observe the object at an elevation of 30 degrees."

When the observers arrived home he went inside and stayed for about 12 minutes. From his elevation of 15 degrees, the object appeared to be at an elevation of 12 degrees as he departed his home. During the 12 minutes he was inside his home, the object could go.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

this time, the car sputtered and the radio started to crackle and stopped playing. Although it was directly after midnight, the neighborhood dogs began to howl. This car was being driven at its maximum speed on a gravel road. Upon reaching home, the car continued to sputter and it appeared to be running out of gas. It had traveled about two hundred yards from the house. At this time the lights in the house were extinguished and the occupants turned off their porch light. Martha State Trooper Richard Gidcumb of Wayne City and State Trooper Richard Gidcumb sent to the Austin farm to witness the sightings. They made approaches and attempted to investigate further but were unable to make an apprehension. The three law enforcement officers observed the object for a period of time and they concluded that the object was beyond their control as it rose in the air and then left. 

Donald Sheriff Mary Lee of Wayne County, Marshall George Sexton of Wayne City and State Trooper Richard Gidcumb sent to the Austin farm to witness the sightings. They made approaches and attempted to investigate further but were unable to make an apprehension. The three law enforcement officers observed the object for a period of time and they concluded that the object was beyond their control as it rose in the air and then left.

Beginning at about 10:30 pm on the evening of 7 August 1953, at approximately 0:0302 hours, two State Troopers observed an object which appeared to be moving from west to east. The object appeared as a red light with occasional flashes and/or fire streaks. The object then appeared as two objects and one object traveled from the south-east and the other traveled towards the north-east and disappeared.

Subsequent to the field investigation additional confirmation of a suspected sighting in the area was claimed. Mt. Louis Banter was contacted for low altitude flights and Kansas City for high altitude flights. This investigation was conducted for flights to the 25th of August 1953. Eastern Airlines Flight 565 over Evansville at 2243Z was found to be consistent with the object sighted in 1953. Also during the 7-8 August 1953 period, a commercial flight from Nashville to St Louis at 0411Z was found to be consistent with activity in the area. Information received revealed that the 3537 was taking the area on the flights on 6/7/9/1953. Call made to Ft Campbell, Ky. PPC Lar Baltimore (Operations) checked records to assure that restricted area was not in use. This ruled out possibility of missiles or activity.

Flares being the cause of the sighting of Xhose and appearing as a meteoric explosion and left the position of their sighting as a meteoric explosion and left the remaining possibility of their sighting as a meteoric explosion.

None of the other reported sightings were investigated.

The following points were considered to be the most pertinent in evaluation of this report:
(a) True and described the objects as appearing as a meteoric explosion and left the position of their sighting as a meteoric explosion and left the position of their sighting as a meteoric explosion and left the position of their sighting as a meteoric explosion and left the position of their sighting as a meteoric explosion and left the position of their sighting as a meteoric explosion.
(b) The witnesses established the position of the UFO at the time of the initial sighting. Subsequent observations and color characteristics suggested that the object was moving in the position of Jupiter and disappearing with dawn.
(c) At no time did the witnesses identify the object as described by them (a) as something meteor-like. (c) The witnesses are described as young adults who were quite certain in the position of Jupiter and disappearing with dawn.

The sighting was reported by a resident and State Trooper that was a meteoric explosion.

The sighting reported by an air-to-air refueling operation which took place over southern Illinois.

It was about 4 or 5 feet from the ground and about 30 or 40 yards away. The color was a brilliant blue and the object appeared rounded. At one point it seemed to split into two parts and then came back together. The light then disappeared.

The estimated size of the object was about 6 feet in diameter. The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes.

This page from the Project Blue Book file does not appear to contain any photographs. Instead, it contains a detailed written account describing an incident involving a bright light in the sky that was observed by multiple witnesses.

The text on the page is as follows:

THIS A.P.R.O. BULLETIN
JANUARY, 1964

Youths . . .

(Continued from Page __)

August .., about 2:45 a.m. at Fairfield, Illinois, a number of youths were returning from an all-night cleaning plant job when they spotted a bright light in Wayne County, Illinois in the early part of August 1963. The light attracted the attention of several other citizens for aerial visitors.

The light was first seen by six youths near the plant at about 2:45 a.m. The light went off and on at intervals and was described as being bigger and brighter than a star. It appeared to be to the west of Mt. Vernon at 11 p.m. Some said it hovered, others that it was moving. It at times appeared as a round, bright object, while at other times it seemed to spread out and take on a different shape. The light was viewed from the town. It was also seen from the yards along the railroad track and was also viewed from several farms in the area.

After roughly 30 minutes, during which it was a jet but there were no blinking lights and no sound coming from it, it suddenly made a sharp turn and went straight toward the southeast. As it approached, the glare became brighter, then after passing directly overhead, it diminished in brightness and went out of sight to the southeast. 

One family reported that their dogs became very disturbed and uneasy during the incident. It's lights went out and after the glare passed the dogs calmed down.

Several people in the area reported the incident to the Wayne County Sheriff's office, which dispatched a deputy to investigate. However, when the deputy arrived on the scene, the object had already disappeared. The men thought it was very strange, at least 2 square feet in size and very low altitude. They were very disturbed and barked all the while. 

Some said Frank Graham, a farm operator, tried to reach the object with a shotgun but was unable to do so. The object had moved out of range before he could fire.

After about 30 minutes, then turned red, flashed away, sounding like a machine. 

Bonnie Austin, whose home is in Centralia, Ill., saw a light following a car on Centralia road between 10 and 10:30 p.m. when the light turned, hovered over the auto, then moved west. Bonnie Austin said the object came down Centralia Road and seemed to be following the car. When the light turned, it hovered over the auto, then moved away to the west.

Another person who saw the object was a motorist whose car was followed by the light. He reported it looking up at him as he drove.

Linder saw a low-flying object at treetop level, close enough that she said, "I could have thrown a rock at it."

It's entirely possible that Austin saw Jupiter, described as very bright in the sky at that time, which would have been west of her location.

Later sightings of a glowing object in the sky were reported to the authorities as possible jet aircraft refueling operations which were unidentified to the observers which were widely seen in the area.

The ball-shaped objects were visually observed but were too distant for accurate identification. It is well known fact that many UFOs, while appearing to be something out of the ordinary, are unidentified and therefore could be a multitude of known aerial vehicles. That is why they are lumped under the title of "Unidentified Flying Objects" for it is their habit to mimic and sometimes resemble known craft.

This explanation for all phenomena.

were many requests from the press and the sighting was attracting
limited interest it was decided to complete the investigation
with personne\ from Wright-Patterson.

Subsequent to the field investigation additional corroborating of
eyewitness accounts made by the witnesses in interviews at the control center confirmed the low altitude flights and Kansas City for high altitude cross over
from this direction was one miles ahead of the sighting and the
controllers at the TVA tower at Evansville TWA 505 was visible from
Evansville to St Louis at 10:15:02. Eastern Airlines flight 505 over
Evansville in 05: hr: 45:05. The sighting under observation was only
a few minutes at the most. A check of Evansville Radar and Eastern Airlines
made to Little Rock Arkansas (Controller for Sandy Spot Refueling
Base) established that no unidentified aircraft refueled during the
0200-0500 time. It was determined that the Upoff sighting was a misinterpretation of the 505 flight.

Call made to Ft Campbell, KY, PFC Rottinore (Operations) checked
records to ascertain that transcribed data was not in use. Call to
Evansville, Indiana, Civilian Defense also failed to disclose any
rule 4 type of activity or sightings of flares being the cause of
the sighting. The "Toy Tank" used over Evansville and left the remaining
possibility of their sighting as a meteor.

None of the other reported sightings were investigated.

1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 8 August 1963
2. LOCATION: Fairfield, Illinois
3. TIME OF OBSERVATION: 2200 Hours
4. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: Approximately 5 minutes
5. NUMBER OF WITNESSES: 1
6. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The witness, a former U.S. Air Force pilot, reported observing a bright light in the western sky which appeared to exhibit rapid changes in color and intensity. The light appeared to move in a straight line and then change direction rapidly. The witness described the object as having no sound and appearing to be at high altitude. The witness attempted to photograph the object but was unsuccessful.
7. INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS: This report appears to represent a bona fide sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The witness, a former Air Force pilot, seems reliable and his description of the observed object is consistent with similar reports. Although the witness attempted to photograph the object, he was unable to do so. This case remains unresolved.
8. CONCLUSIONS: This report is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a UFO sighting.

24 August 1963 -- Light fog was beginning to form in the area. The witness indicated that he leaned over to say something to his girl friend and at that time sighted a flashing glimpse of what he determined to be the moon. We say flashing glimpse because it is obvious it was probably more concerned with the clarity and operation of the vehicle.

The witness was driving his girl friend home. His attention was then transferred to the front.

The moon was also the cause of the sighting at the girl's house. He indicated that the object followed him home; that the Marshall and a State Trooper were summoned; that the Marshall sighted the object and commented that it was the "Evening Star." The Air Force did not have to come up with a unique explanation on this one, only to affirm what the Marshall had said -- the object was Jupiter. Jupiter was low on the horizon in the east, and more than 5 times as bright as anything else in the area. Because of its distance it would appear to follow.

- page 71 -

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram at the bottom that appears to depict a UFO or similar object. However, as per the instructions, I will not identify or name any humans in the image, since there are no human faces present.

TRANSCRIPT:
Jupiter can appear in colors other than blue, i.e. red, orange, green. 
The object followed the exact path of Jupiter. It disappeared last, which would make it appear brighter and still be visible at dawn.

Then, the State trooper, upon leaving the youth's home sighted a fireball entering the earth's atmosphere far to the south. This is excessively rare, occuring about 350 times a year.

On the night of the 6th there was a report from a witness that he said that this log was raining a fuse and was escaping operation. The receiver passed overhead and the tanker directed after breaker.

PFTG BULLETIN Sept 63

UNITED STATES SIGHTINGS...August 5 & 8,1963 VERNON WAYNE CITY & FAIRFIELD, ILLINOIS. This sighting took place the week of Aug 5. UFOs were seen by witnesses the following night too. Attempts replv to our inquiry about his sighting were unsuccessful following an Aug 8th issue of the V/ayne County Press.

A strange object reported as a spherical light, bright as a brilliant star, with a very rapid gyrat-ion, was observed by the witnesses, who called the police at Mt Vernon. They said the object hovered over the scene for a time, then suddenly took off at an estimated speed of 1500 mph, moving straight up into the sky, and disappeared.

Dr. Keyhoe of NICAP at Fairfield and he told them what thev had gotten was something called a tethered balloon but they contend that what they saw was a strange object too.

Witnesses named as in the Aug 8th issue of the Wayne County Press were Harry S. Gorin, Fairfield, 111. 6:7:,59. I believe a circular of a spherical light, bright as a brilliant star, with a very rapid gyration, was observed by the witnesses, who called the police at Mt Vernon. They said the object hovered over the scene for a time, then suddenly took off at an estimated speed of 1500 mph, moving straight up into the sky, and disappeared.

Dayton, Ohio (ATIG) sent three investigators down to the area to interview the witnesses and check the spot but couldn't find anything unusual, and the chief investigator advised that did the others see in the Mt Vernon area, for a few of us at Fairfield did see Jupiter as large as the landing light of an airplane.

LOCATION: Fairfield, Illinois. DATE OF SIGHTING: July 28, 1963. DESCRIPTION: According to the 8-page report submitted by Mt. Vernon and forwarded to me, the incident occurred at approximately 8:30 PM CST on the above date. Mr. Vernon and Mrs. Servilla, residents of Fairfield, Illinois, were driving south on State Highway 15 about 5 miles south of Fairfield when they observed an unidentified aerial object. The object was described as round, white, and luminous. It appeared to be hovering or stationary at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. After observing the object for approximately 5 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. No sound was heard. The entire sighting lasted about 5-6 minutes."

CAE ALLISON, OF FAIRFIELD, ILLINOIS, REPORTED THAT HE WAS DRIVING ALONG HIGHWAY #50 NEAR FAIRFIELD, ILLINOIS, AT 12:10 A.M. ON AUGUST 1, 1963, WHEN HE NOTICED A BRIGHT, ROUND RED LIGHT IN THE SKY. THE LIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND ABOUT 200 YARDS AWAY FROM HIS CAR. HE STATED THAT THE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 20 FEET IN DIAMETER AND THAT IT WAS HOVERING SILENTLY. ALLISON SAID THAT HE SLOWED HIS CAR AND PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE OBJECT. HE STATED THAT WHEN HE STOPPED HIS CAR, THE OBJECT BEGAN TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY IN A NORTH-WESTERLY DIRECTION, AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED. ALLISON STATED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND THAT IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SOUND. ALLISON SAID THAT HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE, HELICOPTER, OR ANY OTHER CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. HE STATED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE OBJECT CLEARLY, AND THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY CIRCULAR IN SHAPE.

ILLINOIS HOST TO SMALL 'FLAP'
For two weeks, starting on August 5 and ending about August 20, Illinois played host to a small UFO 'flap.' The flap began when a man in Fairfield, Ill., in Wayne county, reported that he noticed a light above and a little behind his car. The light, which he said was as big as an automobile, reportedly swooped near his and sent his car radio into a spin and caused the motor to sputter (a characteristic not too uncommon in many UFO reports).
While he was record at speeds up to 120 m.p.h., but that the light kept pace with his car after the 10 mile chase hone, both young people were much - and his date, and said the light was hovering over the house when he stepped out with a shotgun. It was mystical and had to be put under sedation. For a period of several days after the event, other members of the Fairfield community saw the light.
Upoff, 59, a farmer, who said it lit up a hayyard of his, was so frightened, and many people got up and down to an angle," he said.
Wayne county circuit clerk, described the light as "a cross-shaped affair with a tall on it."
But alas! All the sightings were quickly explained by the Air Force. While we hate to be too critical, since we did not make a personal investigation, we should like to point out: The Air Force said that what was seen was the moon partly hidden by fog. To our knowledge, the moon can seldom or never create an image or to cause car engines to sputter! The other explanations, Jupiter, a firehall, and a refueling operation are a little more convincing to us. Jupiter, which is quite bright at this time of year, is what some saw hovering over his house, a refueling between a jet bomber and a tanker.
A state trooper who saw a falling light actually saw a fireball.
We are presenting in the next couple pages several clippings which will deal with the incidents in more detail. Any further developments will be reported in the next issue.

1. This report is submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2, and verbal instructions of Headquarters, Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) (RADO).

2. Initial information was received from Wright-Patterson AFB, with the message that a peculiar light had been observed in the vicinity of Fairfield, Illinois, on 6 August 1963. The local Deputy Sheriff at Fairfield headquarters contacted Mr. Vernon, who personally observed the object, but did not talk at length with the observer.

3. Fairfield is on Route 15, approximately thirty miles east of Mt. Vernon. This is approximately eighty miles southeast of Scott AFB. The initial observation occurred at Burford Crossing, which intersects Route 15 eight miles east of Mt. Vernon.

4. The observers, a family driving east on Route 15 at approximately 0500Z, 6 August 1963, when they were suddenly "attacked" by a bright light, which approached their vehicle. They tried to elude the light, but were unsuccessful. He claimed to have seen a "high white light" which drew close to the automobile and moved rapidly around it. The light then moved off into a field near their house and advised its departure to his parents. They turned out the lights and went outside. They, too, saw the light hovering over a grove of trees about two hundred yards distant. It then moved off rapidly and was gone.

5. Mr. Vernon was subsequently called to the location. He confirmed how the light disappeared. Mr. Vernon was shown a location where the light had been observed. Upon arrival, a light in the distance was shown a light in the sky. This was later confirmed as being the planet Jupiter. Mr. Vernon indicated that the Austins are highly respected, reliable people. The older Mr. Austin, a farmer, is a furrier. His son's occupation and age were not determined. Originally, Mr. Vernon indicated there was no specific shape to the object.

U.S.A.
"Morning star" chases car
The following account of a "morning star" chasing an automobile was written by Mr. Wilbur H. Atwater of Fairfield, 111., following an encounter with the unusual phenomenon. 
On the night of August 8, 1963, at approximately 12:30 A.M. (midnight), a bright light, brighter than any star I have ever seen, was observed chasing an automobile approximately 10 to 15 miles an hour early yesterday, traveling in a southeasterly direction. The light seemed to be about 200 to 300 feet behind the car, and was traveling at a terrific rate of speed, estimated to be around 1,500 to 2,000 miles an hour. 
The automobile was traveling from Mount Vernon, Illinois, to Fairfield, Illinois, a distance of approximately 40 miles. The light followed the car for several miles, and then suddenly disappeared. 
The man claimed the light seemed to have a "crackling sound" and had a "cone-shaped" appearance. He also reported that the light seemed to be "guided" and not just a random phenomenon. The light was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes and passed overhead at a very high altitude.

WHITE COUNTY PRESS Wednesday 5 August 1959

THEN SUDDENLY, I REMEMBER SEEING THIS LITTLE GREEN OBJECT THAT LOOKED SO STRANGE.

When I said that I did not realize the exciting experience that had occurred, the object would shoot up. 

When I'd slowed down it almost down. My car is built for speeding and can do 120 miles an hour and it
was almost down. 

At first it was on the south side of the road and then it crossed over to the north side. The little green object
would dart back and forth and hover and was attacking my car. 

When we reached my girl's house her sister, Geraldine, said: "Did you see that thing?" And she said it looked
like a flying saucer.

Finally, I had to be home as I made a run for the car. That's when the fun really began.

In closing, as I pulled away from the house the object began to follow me. I had to really press the gas down
to make the car go. The object kept up with me, however, it seemed to stay about 100 feet behind me. I would
stomp the full on the gravel road in an effort to lose it but it stayed right with me. I would never have been able
to shake the object. It followed me all the way home.

IT CAME WITHIN 100 FEET OF ME, said Ronnie Austin, 18, of Carmi, who described his fright after seeing the strange
object in a drive-in movie.

BOY TELLS WHAT HAPPENED

Ronnie Austin, 18, of Carmi, gives the Press the following account of his strange experience with a flying object:

When Phyllis and I went out to the drive-in movie. We saw the show and were coming home about 1 a.m. As we neared the town, I noticed a strange little green object in the sky. It seemed to be following my car.

Phyllis looked out and replied: "No, it's not an airplane, it doesn't have the flashing red and green lights."

WAYNE COUNTY PRESS 5 August 1963

Keenes Boy Chased Home By 'Flying Saucer', Police Called!

A 13-year-old Keenes boy was chased from his home by what he thought was a "flying saucer" and the police were called after he had run into his home, it was reported here today. 

The whole neighborhood got this story when he started telling about it. The boy said he was outside his home when he noticed a bright light through the trees. He ran into his home, frightened, and told his father about it. 

"It was different than any light I have ever seen," the boy said. "It couldn't make out any shape of it, but it seemed to be hovering off the ground." 

His father told him it was probably just an airplane, but the boy insisted it was not. Quickly they called police at the Keenes station, who in turn notified the Wayne City police station.

Among the officers rushing to the scene was Deputy Wayne County Sheriff Eugene King. "It was different than anything I have ever seen," he said. "It did not twinkle and seemed to be hovering over the field."

The deputy said the "flying saucer" continued to hover in the field for about 15 to 20 minutes and then suddenly took off at a terrific speed. "I'd say it was going between 500 and 800 miles an hour," he said. 

A Press reporter hastened to the scene, but the "flying saucer" had disappeared when he arrived. He was told the story by the boy's father, who said his son was very "shook up" over the incident.

"We would tell it wasn't an airplane. Every time we would think it was going to take off, it would just hover there," the father said. "We watched it for quite some time before the police arrived."

The boy's grandfather, Mrs. Essie Arthur, said the incident had upset the youngster. "He was really scared about it," she said. "We had to work to calm him down."

Story Given Big Play

The "light in the sky" story is

object on the eastern sky here
Wednesday night about 9 o'clock. 

Descriptions of how it looked

Bright As Diamond
Perhaps getting the best view
of the phenomenon was Chaffney
Hill, operator of the gasoline
station at the junction of U.S.
highway 45, four miles east of
Fairfield, and he said that "it
was brighter than the
brightest star." Mike Hill, operator of the
Hill gasoline plant here, said 
that he and two other men were
standing in the yard talking and

"I quickly saw it . . . it was
moving from the west, some over
25,000 feet high." 

"SHE SWOOPED AROUND WITH LIGHTNING-LIKE SPEED," said Chaffney Hill, "and changed its
course as she did so." Mike Hill, when they described the object.

Text output from the document:

Lights Went Out
Lights went out in our area about 11:30 p.m. - August 8, 1963. There were some unusual things observed north of the old Fairfield High School according to Mr. Austin, a young man living there.
He said the lights went out and then a very bright light appeared in the sky, and believed for a time that it was the moon. But it didn't have blinking lights like an airplane. It seemed to be very large as it passed over the school. When it passed over the horizon, the light changed to a different color and continued westward.
Mr. and Mrs. Bill Short corroborate this account. They were driving home from Fairfield when the lights went out and they saw the bright light in the sky as they drove home. They said it was a large ball, reddish in color, and no sound was heard.
The Deputy Sheriff from Wayne Air Force Intelligence said that their office had received reports about the incident and objects in the area Sunday night. 
Deputy Lee said he had received several telephone reports and some military personnel from Greenvillr, ill., had notifyied his office about the object as they had seen something strange Sunday night.
Another man, Harold Solen, from Fairfield, told authorities he thought it was an Unidentified Flying Object from another planet. Mr. Solen wrote: "The thing seemed to be hovering or standing still for a while and was of a strange shape and color. It was like a ball of fire, brilliant but not hurting the eyes to look at it. It passed on out of sight rather slowly." 

When told by the reporter that there had been no further sightings, Mr. Solen said: "I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping it would be seen again and traced."

The Deputy Sheriff said that his office had notified the Air Force Intelligence from Scott Air Force Base about the incident and objects in the area Sunday night.

WAYNE COUNTY PRESS, MONDAY 19 AUGUST 1963

SIGHTINGS IN SKY
APPEAR ON WAYNE

Some Reported in County Over 
Week-End, Others in Other 
Counties.

Are Wayne County Residents
Witness to-the-sky activity as 
strange as they describe? Recent 
reports from Wayne and adjoining 
counties indicate that there is.

Last police-reported sighting in 
the Fairfield area was Wednesday 
night. The object, described as a 
large, bright light, was sighted on 
several occasions around Fairfield 
over the week and is attracting 
considerable attention.

Last Tuesday evening a large ob
ject, described as a star-like light, 
was reported by several persons 
in the Fairfield area. It was ob
served for several minutes and 
then disappeared. 

Early last Saturday morning a 
Fairfield man, who asked to re
main anonymous, reported seeing 
a strange lighted object in the 
sky. He said it appeared to be 
about half the size of the full 
moon and was a greenish-yellow 
color. He observed it for about 
five minutes as it moved slowly 
across the sky, he said.

At Mt. Vernon, Ill., a Fairfield 
man reported seeing a strange ob
ject in the sky which he said was 
a bright star-like object which re
mained stationary in the sky for 
about five minutes, then suddenly 
disappeared.

CLAIM AIR FORCE 
KEEPS LID ON UFOS

Representatives From Private Or
ganizations Contend There Is 
Suppression of Evidence.

A claim that the U. S. Air Force 
is suppressing evidence about un
identified flying objects was made 
Saturday night by representatives 
from private organizations study
ing UFOs.

The claim was made during a 
televised interview when the repre
sentatives contended that the Air 
Force has identified over 700 UFOs 
but has kept most of the evidence 
secret. They said the Air Force's 
official policy of denying evidence 
of UFOs is "inherently dangerous".

The representatives, who identi
fied themselves as members of the 
National Investigations Committee 
on Aerial Phenomena and the 
Aerial Phenomena Research Or
ganization, said the Air Force has 
been with Time Magazine. It 
is a "complex phenomenon" with 
more than 12,000 reported cases 
on 6,000 files of UFO sightings, 
most of the reports still top 
secret.

"Inherently Dangerous"
The NICAP board of directors 

said the Air Force has been with
holding information and sup
pressing evidence of UFO ac
tivity from the public. Air Force 
Col. Robert Friend, an intelli
gence officer, denied the NICAP 
charges and said the Air Force 
has been open about all evidence.

A publicity release from NICAP 
said the Air Force denies high
quality, multiple-witness UFO 
cases, such as the recent sighting 
in the Far East.

Air Force Probes 'Mystery Light'
WAYNE CITY, Ill. - An Air Force Intelligence officer was reported to have questioned several persons in Wayne County concerning an unidentified light in the sky.
He will question the 15 to 20 persons who reportedly saw the light when a plane flashed on and off, according to his findings to the Air Force and Dr. Allen Hynek, director of Northwestern's Dearborn Observatory.
Dr. Hynek is chairman of the project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigation organization. 
At the present stage, we don't know whether the light was associated with a plane, said Dr. Hynek from Evanston. Neither have we found a cause to account for it, said Dr. Hynek. We think this caused the light.
The light was reportedly spotted again Wednesday night from the ground in Fairfield.

LIGHT IN SKY CHASES CAR, BESIEGES HOME OF FARMER
Fairfield Ill. (AP) - A strange light in the sky early Sunday morning chased a farmer as he was driving home, then hovered over his farmhouse for more than two hours, the deputy sheriff said.

Harry Lee, the deputy, said the light appeared to be larger than any star. He described it as white and hovering at about 200 feet above the ground. It was first seen about 1 a.m. and remained in the area for more than two hours after midnight until it disappeared.

Lee said he went to the farm house of Clovis Austin, 48, and the light was still in the sky. Austin said he turned his car radio onto a station and could not get any other stations. As the light came closer, he said.

Ronnie, said he raced at top speed for the 17 miles to his father's farm yard and he and his father watched the strange light until it finally disappeared.

Turns Off Lights
Austin said he rushed into the house and told his wife to turn off all the lights, but that the light was hovering at about 50 feet above the ground and beamed light into the farmhouse. Austin called for help, but no one came.

After more than two hours, the strange light shot up into the sky and disappeared, Austin said. Lee said he supported the story. Lee said the witnesses appeared to be reliable.

Lee said police in Mount Vernon, 17 miles to the south, also received calls about the strange light.

AIR FORCE AID TO INVESTIGATE 'LIGHT IN SKY'
All Investigative Effort
Scott air force base near here will investigate a report of a "light in the sky" seen near Fairfield, Ill., the Air Force said Wednesday.
Wayne county residents before dawn Monday saw a bright light hovering over a farmhouse near this southern Illinois city, the sheriff's office reported.
The light was described as about the size of a basketball, and hovering about 50 feet above the ground. It beamed light into the farmhouse and the nearby area for about two hours before shooting straight up into the sky and disappearing, the report said.
An Air Force spokesman said the local base will investigate the report and try to determine the nature of the light.

A Keenes, Ill., boy was chased home Sunday night by a "flying saucer", police officers said today. 
The whole neighborhood was in a dither about it, they said.
The 12-year-old boy told police the object was about 40 feet wide, sort of glowing, and was after him. He ran for his home, awakened his parents, and the parents called the Fairfield police. 
Patrolmen from the Fairfield police were promptly notified to check the report. They were looking for a "flying saucer" when A deputy sheriff from a nearby county saw it too.
"It came within 100 feet of me," said Ronnie Austin, the deputy sheriff. "It was a bright, brilliant light, almost like a star."
The boy, who was up in the sky as the object passed over, said it seemed to him much bigger than a star. 
"I said to Erville, 'Look there, it's back,' and before I could say anything more, it was gone," Austin reported.
The family was so shaken by the incident that the boy was given a sedation to quiet his terror.

When I'd passed my car up, the object would speed directly up and then 'zig-zag' down, first to the left and then to the right. It was about an inch long.

At first it was on the south side of the road and then it crossed over to the north. It went out over the field and then quickly turned on back. I thought they'd encounter some foreign object or something unusual. When I finally reached the house, my sister, Francine, was standing there. She had seen it too, from the kitchen window. She and I both ran out and watched it through the window. 

Finally, I made a run for the car. That's when the fun really began. 

As I pulled away from the house, the object began to follow me. I could hardly keep my eyes on the road, I was so busy watching it. I was amazed and just couldn't believe what I was seeing. I had never seen anything like it before.

Light-In-the-Sky Story Gains Momentum Here: Another Strange Object Is Seen

Another strange object, described as being "swooped around with lightning like speed," was seen in the skies over Fairfield this morning around 6:30 o'clock. According to reports reaching the Daily Wayne this morning, the object was observed by several persons, including Ernest J. Patacca, of Fairfield, when they stepped out of their homes at about 6:30 a.m.

The latest incident comes as a followup to the so-called "light-in-the-sky" phenomenon reported here two weeks ago, when a large glowing object was sighted over the area by several persons, including Clareic Circuit Clerk James P. Wiley and others. Wiley said he and several other persons watched the strange object for nearly two hours on the night of August 7. The object first appeared as a bright light in the northeast sky, then changed shape to an elongated, glowing object, he said. It seemed to hover for a time, then made a quick, sweeping motion and disappeared from view.

Patacca, who reported the latest incident to the Daily Wayne, said he and others stepped outside their homes around 6:30 a.m. today and saw the strange object "swooped around with lightning like speed." He said it appeared to be "kind of circular in shape and glowed with a greenish-white light."

Patacca said the object was in sight for only a few minutes, then disappeared from view. He said several other persons in the Fairfield area also reported seeing the strange object this morning.

This latest report comes on the heels of the earlier "light-in-the-sky" incident, which stirred quite a bit of comment and speculation in the community. Some persons reportedly suggested it might have been a satellite, meteor, or even a UFO (unidentified flying object). The new report will no doubt add fuel to the curiosity and interest in these strange sky phenomena.

"Stranger Object" Is Seen
Shined around with Flashing Lights, and Courtesy Upward (lett) as he probed to the Ground that Made Him Wonder Whet It All Meant
Mrs. Audrey Toler and family saw a strange object in the sky near their home on Tuesday evening at about 10:30 p.m. She said the object appeared to be hovering about 1,000 feet up in the sky and giving off a bright light that seemed to flash in all directions. It appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter.
 from the ground the object seemed large and somewhat round in shape, and it seemed to remain stationary for about 10 minutes. Then it began to move slowly in a southeast direction from their home, she said.
The family watched it intently for several minutes as it slowly disappeared into the dark sky. They saw no wings or other visible means of propulsion.
Mrs. Toler said her young son, Gary, was greatly impressed by the object and told his mother that it was "like nothing he had ever seen before."

OUTPUT TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

"When I got back, Miles said, "There's something going on out there that we don't understand." He said he had seen a strange light in the sky with a pinkish-blue color that seemed to be moving rapidly. He said it would disappear for a while and then reappear in a different spot in the sky. 

He said his father and grandfather had also seen it. Then it disappeared. As to what it was, I do not know. We have not seen it since. 

Mrs. Shore said, "When I got home, my husband said that he had seen a strange light in the sky about 9 p.m. Monday. He said the light was round and would dart up, down, or sideways, very rapidly, and then come to a sudden stop, and then dart off again."

Mr. Shore went inside to call the police, but when he came out, the light had disappeared. He said he does not know what the object might have been.

Others saw it 
Mr. Moxley, who lives north, said that a friend of his, who lives nearby, reported seeing a strange object in the sky about the same time as the Shores did. This friend said the object was a large, circular, brilliant light with four flashing lights like portholes on the side. He said it moved rapidly and then went straight down into the sea, a round ball with more pronounced sticking out.

Mrs. Shore went inside her home to call the police, but when her husband came back outside, the light had disappeared. She said she does not know what the object might have been."

The deputy said he would probably need more Polaroid film, since some of those seeing the object were taking pictures.
The object was seen by many persons, both military and civilian, and several took photographs.
The saucer was said to be 40 to 60 feet in diameter, bright, metallic-looking, and elliptical in shape. It moved in a north-easterly direction and was seen for several minutes.

The deputy said he had received over 20 telephone calls and letters, with information and questions about the object, as he had gone through a similar experience him.
Another man, Harold Solem, is an enthusiastic amateur photographer. He told Deputy Lee that it was an Unidentified Flying Object. He said he could not believe his eyes, but took several pictures of it as it passed overhead. Mr. Solem wrote: "The object maintained the same speed and altitude throughout the two to three minutes I observed it. It gave no indication of engines or fuel or operators or stabilizers. The only sound was a very faint hum. This was no conventional aircraft, but something very strange and highly technical, far ahead of us. I am convinced, after having seen it, that we are not alone in this universe."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, likely describing a UFO sighting.

"There are non-earth people visiting here and I know these and have seen them", Mr. Owen told the Press. 

On a Wednesday evening, around nine o'clock, Deputy Lee observed a lighted object, four to five times the size of a star, coming from the north. The object slowed down and hovered a bit, then took off at a very high rate of speed. At one point it was about 15 degrees above the horizon. This was about 9 p.m. 

According to the report, a Miss Sarah Pemble called the Sheriff's office to report she had seen "a strange lighted object" that flew over a field near her home. Two other persons, not named, also saw the object. 

The report states that Key Bock said he would pay $1,000 for a tape recording of the sighting made by Deputy Lee. The report also mentions several churches in the area that have observed "strange lights in the sky" that may be related to UFOs.

The document concludes by discussing the possibility that present-day troubles may be involved with the appearance of UFOs and that the situation requires serious study and investigation.

Air Force Solves Lights Mystery
Explanation: Fireboll and Jet Bomber
The Air Force has come up with an explanation for those mysterious lights reported in the sky over an area near Fairfield, Illinois. It was all the work of the moon, said the Air Force experts.

The lights, which appeared brighter than any star, were actually caused by the reflection of moonlight on a fast-moving jet bomber, the Air Force disclosed. The size and brightness of the lights had led to speculation that they were much higher than any conventional bomber.

If was also revealed that other lights seen in the area recently were those of a fireboll, a rare phenomenon brighter than any star. The fireboll, the Air Force said, is caused by a solid object entering the earth's atmosphere at a high velocity and burning up.

The information was relayed to the Air Force base in nearby Vandalia from residents who had reported the strange lights. The Vandalia base in turn passed the details on to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, site of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official agency for investigating UFO reports.

WAYNE CITY -- An Air Force intelligence officer was sent to Wayne City Saturday to investigate a "mystery light" spotted in the skies over the area by a Wayne County farm family.

The light, according to Lt. H.C. Kinsey, was seen about 12:30 a.m. Monday over western Wayne County and near the Southern Illinois University campus. Mike Hill, 37, operator of a farm near Fairfield, said he and another man saw the light early Monday, then reported it to the Air Force.

Hill said the light was estimated to be about 800 feet off the ground. It appeared and disappeared at intervals, he said, and was described as a bright, pulsating object about the size of a basketball. 

The Air Force is investigating the incident.
