CALIFORNIA YOUTHS SHOOT AT UFO: On the night of September 21st, in the midst of a local saucer flap, two 17-year-old boys from Rio Vista, California, shot at a flying saucer which had landed near a water tower on the edge of town. This occurred following a wild chase of eight miles, during which the youths followed the UFO until it finally landed. The bullet made a metallic sound as it bounced off the craft. The UFO was hovering just three feet above the ground at the time. It was glowing, and appeared to be about the size of an automobile hood, according to these and other witnesses. (San Diego Union, 10/1/65.)

DATE:           9-29-65
TIME:           1:00 P.M.
PLACE:          RIO VISTA HIGH SCHOOL

At above time and date interviewed [redacted] and [redacted] in the office of the school superintendent [redacted]. Both boys were emphatic in their stories regarding the object they had observed on the evening of 22 September. They both stated that this object gave off a red pulsing glow and that they had shot at it from a distance of about 100 feet and that when they did hit it, the object would give off a brighter glow. When the bullets struck this object, they sounded like they hit metal. Neither boy could give a definite description of this object other than that it appeared to be flat and about five feet across.

[Redacted] School Superintendent grudgingly admitted that he had gone out to where the object had last been sighted on the following night and apparently a large number of Rio Vista residents who had heard about this object were also at that location. He stated that he saw this object but thought that it must have been the planet Venus or an hallucination. His description of the object is the same as the one given by the boys. The object gives off a red pulsating glow, moves swiftly then suddenly disappears. He further states that possibly a few Rio Vista people had observed this object on this same night, September 23, 1965.

Police Chief Manuel Cardoza who was present stated that a woman in town belonged to some organization that investigates unidentified flying objects and claimed to have pictures of some sightings that she has made.
