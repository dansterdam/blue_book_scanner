As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

At approx. 7:45 PM 9-8-65 my wife and I were proceeding home from Rio Vista, California to our home in Pittsburg, California. We live about 20 miles from Rio Vista. 
As we were proceeding along the highway about 1 1/2 miles outside of Rio Vista, we observed a bright light which appeared to be hovering about 50 ft off the ground and about 1/2 mile ahead of us. It was a very bright light, RB went to my house and got a 22 rifle and went out to the porch to examine the object. As we watched, the object seemed to move a short distance, about 6 yards off the ground, and then it just went straight up at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared. It was all over in less than 5 seconds. I went to the area the next morning and could find no physical evidence, no burned or marked ground. The object was simply gone. This is all the details I can give you about this incident. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

The image does not contain any photographs. Based on the text in the document, the image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing an incident involving California youths who reported seeing a UFO on the night of September 21, 1965 near Rio Vista, California. The document describes the youths seeing a "shining object" that appeared to land near a water tower, and that they heard a "metallic sound" as the object departed. The report states that the UFO was hovering and appeared to be approximately 15 to 20 feet in size. The text in the document is as follows:

CALIFORNIA YOUTHS SPORT AT UFO: On the night of September 21st, in the vicinity of Rio Vista, California, must a 15-year-old girl bullet at a flying saucer which had landed near a water tower, according to the information received.
The object was described as a shining metallic object about 15-20 feet in diameter. After it was seen to land, it gave off a metallic sound as it departed. The UFO was hovering just above the ground at the time of the sighting.

TIME:	1:40 P.M.
LOCATION: MIDLAND WEST VIS-A-VIS, D4-7, TRACT 3 - PROPERTY. CAR 33600
Pursuant to the directive contained in DAFM 200-2, the following information is submitted:
On 9-29-65 at approximately 1:40 p.m., this writer and Miss _______ were driving in the vicinity of Rio Vista in Solano County, California. We observed what appeared to be a flame suspended in the air approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground in an area known by the designation indicated above. This flame was circular in shape, and appeared to hover or float in the air. It remained stationary for approximately 4 to 5 minutes, then suddenly began to move rapidly in a zig-zag pattern, disappearing into the distance. The object had a definitely defined outline, and was surrounded by a faint blue halo, which seemed to pulsate and vary in intensity as the object moved. It was a clear, sunny day, and conditions were ideal for visual observations.  No other unusual phenomena were noted in the sky at the time.
GO! REPORT TO LT. COL. R.J. DORGER TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION.
