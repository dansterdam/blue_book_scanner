11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers reported cigar shaped object in the east that was compared in brightness with a sunset. Two of the observers reported a descending object while the other two reported a ascending object. The time of the sighting varied from 5 seconds to 75 seconds. In all cases the object was reported as being orange in color. One observer reported that the object was stationary for a few seconds before heading toward the east. Aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting, but the description of the sight does not comply with known aircraft sightings. The aircraft XXXXXXXXXXX in the area were B-52 using a low level training route. The data is conflicting, particularly when referring to the question of the object, descend or not.
