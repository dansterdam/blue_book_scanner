Gentlemen -

On the night of 4-28-66, about 9 o'clock, my husband, myself and my young son observed a pattern of lights that were travelling at a very low speed at low altitude. The lights were green when first sighted, were green but turned to a bright flashing red. They would stop, move, blink very fast. My husband was in the Air Force and he said no aircraft could travel this slow. There was no sound. We would very much like to receive a copy of Project Blue Book. (over)

we are aware that Don
Chemical is operating with
a certain type of propulsion
and wonder if their
project is being tested in
this vicinity.
