16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: ___________________
b. Color: ____________________

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One) a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document contains a hand-drawn circle in the sketch area of question 17, and some handwritten notes in the drawing area of question 19, including what appears to be an arrow pointing "NORTH".

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of this object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

COORDINATION: TD-E [Signature] DATE 16 Aug 61
Major Robert J. Friend

The committee has in the meantime been going over some other reports and would like much more information on the 25 July 1961 report, at Palatka, Florida; the "object separating and joining together again" suggests similarity to some of the French sightings and the committee would like to have the unreliability of this report more solidly established.

Palatka, Fla.
July 25, 1961

Pentagon
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs,

On the night of July 25, about ten minutes after eight, four flying objects were observed over Putnam County, Florida. They were moving from the west and about 9 5° off west horizon, they listed north. They were a very short distance in this direction. Then made a 90° turn and headed again in the west. At about 75° off west horizon the four objects converged into one. Previous to this they appeared blue-white. After they changed shape they became a slight orange color, then they disappeared behind trees. The incident was witnessed by night individuals for about two minutes. There was no sound from these objects.

[Signature area is blacked out]

Dear Miss,

While a short time ago setting in my yard I saw two white-white Palatka lights moving across the sky from east & west at about 4:00 off to the western horizon. These lights moved tremendously and turned crimson and then made a sharp 180° turn and headed again into the west. At this made another sharp 90° turn and headed north still glowing crimson red and moving at tremendous speed.

There was lighting in the west and dark low off planed a silver, due close to some constant of the sky glow.

This took place in about 3 minutes first noticed around 9:30 PM Eastern time 29 - 1961.

I am sure this was not a jet or aircraft or had just passed of any kind.

From the unidentified agent's document:

From the unidentified agent's report I heard we occurred but a will here
the incident passed along.

The unidentified flying object was flying and maneuvering to port & left in
git.

I am writing this letter in accordance with the air technical intelligence commands as drawing of a statement for reports of such matters.

Thank you.

The page contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a sailboat or sailing vessel. The drawing is very light and minimalistic, done in pencil or light graphite on a white background. There are some faint markings or notations on the sides of the page, but the text is not clearly legible. The sketch shows the basic outline of a boat with a sail, drawn with simple lines.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

The image appears to be a document with significant portions redacted (blacked out). While some text is visible, much of the document is obscured by black rectangles. The parts of the text that are legible are difficult to make out completely due to the image quality and redactions. The document seems to be an official report or communication, but the specific details cannot be fully discerned from this image.
