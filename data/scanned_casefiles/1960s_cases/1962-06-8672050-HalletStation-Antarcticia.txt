10. AZIMUTH SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
During the course of carrying out routine duties in the LG area, I observed in the sky at about 20 degrees N of the horizon, a single object or vapour trail, brownish-yellowish in color, appearing and disappearing at intervals within a period of about a minute. The object was never sharply defined and appeared to consist of a succession of shape and color changes, none of which could be specifically described. The general impression was of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, possibly related to atmospheric conditions, which did not resemble anything previously experienced or reported.
11. COMMENTS
The object was observed by Cpt E.J. Jenson, who happened to be present and observed the same phenomenon. No further information or evidence was available.

OFFICIAL HALLET STATION REPORT

HAL MCCORKLE - SCIENTIST

HAD WITNESSED THIS U.F.O. WITH STATION COMMANDER PHIL MOORE AT 0215 HOURS ON 6 JUNE 1962 WHILE ON ROUTINE PATROL APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES FROM STATION. OBJECT APPROACHED STATION FROM EAST AT HIGH SPEED, SLOWED TO ABOUT 100 KNOTS, THEN HOVERED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. IT WAS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, APPEARED TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER, AND HAD A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT EMANATING FROM LOWER PORTION. AFTER HOVERING, IT ACCELERATED TO TREMENDOUS SPEED AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON TO THE WEST.

COMMANDER MOORE AND I BOTH OBSERVED THIS OBJECT WITH MANY OTHER PERSONNEL WHO WERE SUMMONED TO OBSERVE IT AS WELL. THIS WAS A HIGHLY UNUSUAL SIGHTING THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED USING CONVENTIONAL MEANS. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR SOME TIME THROUGH BINOCULARS AND WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED AS ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE MANNER IN WHICH IT OPERATED IS COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO ANYTHING IN OUR CURRENT INVENTORY OF AEROSPACE VEHICLES.

STRONGLY RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY RELEVANT AUTHORITIES. THIS IS A MATTER OF GRAVE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN.

NEW ZEALAND
Unidentified Photograph
The original copy of the photograph described below was made in New Zealand on April 23, 1960. It shows an unusual and brightly lit oblong object in the sky. 
The witness reported that the object remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then rapidly gained altitude and disappeared from view. 
The witness concluded that the object was artificial and not a natural phenomenon. An analysis of the photograph by a photographic expert indicated that there was no evidence of hoax or trick photography.

TD-3/LS Col D I Read:
Unidentified flying objects sighted in the Antarctic.
1. Date: 23 June 1962 at 01932 witnessed at Hallett Station, 72-20 S and 170-00 E observed an object which they described as brilliant white light, larger than a normal star in size, very low intensity, and moving at a very slow rate across the sky. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and the object was observed for 5 minutes but due to it moving out of normal vision, it was lost.
2. It is suspected that it was a normal star and that the object passed through a thin cloud or haze causing the observed illusion. This caused the object and that is of the opinion that the object was nothing unusual, however unusual it may have appeared and if this condition was not continuous. The elevation of the object was less than 10 degrees and the object was observed through a theodolite.
3. Apparent size of the object was about 1/2 the size of a full moon and the color of the object was brilliant white. No sound was heard and the object appeared stationary except for the slow northward drift. The object gave no indication of rotation or movement other than the steady drift. The object was seen for approximately 15 minutes and disappeared from view behind clouds on the horizon.
4. On 25 August 1962 at 0930, a report of a similar sighting was made from the McMurdo Station, Antarctica. This was observed by experienced personnel and it appeared to have the same characteristics as the object of 23 June 1962, except that the size was somewhat smaller. This sighting was also made by use of a theodolite and the object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing behind clouds on the horizon.

Text extracted from the document:

This appears to be a report about a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) near Hallet Station in Antarctica. The report describes the object as being a "strongly visible brilliantly shining object" which was observed for over 45 minutes. The object is said to have performed various maneuvers, including hovering, rapid acceleration, and abrupt changes in direction. The report suggests that the object was not a conventional aircraft and could not be easily explained. It also mentions that the object was witnessed by multiple observers at the Hallet Station research facility. The report is signed by a researcher or investigator whose name is partially redacted.
