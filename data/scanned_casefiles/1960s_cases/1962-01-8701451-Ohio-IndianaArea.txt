This case involves several bright green objects with long tails moving very rapidly across the sky. Durations ranged from 1 to 6 sec. All sightings took place at night during a period of 1 to 2 min. Witnesses describe the objects as being very bright and fiery in appearance. The objects were viewed by both military and civilian observers. This sighting is richest on the third-order shower and other bright meteors (or the fireball class) which were not of the shower.

Report on sighting of flying object
Jan. 3, 1962.
Position seen: Right. Several degrees under E. 6 AZ of N.
Apparent course: W.S.W. - straight line, horizontal.
Disappearance: Sudden. 10 to 15 above horizon W.N.W.
Elapsed time of observation: 3 seconds.
Apparent shape: Round. 
Apparent size: About 1/3 of full moon area. 
Constant diminution to about 25% of original size
at disappearance at which time it was about still several
times larger than Venus at that time of night. 
Color: Brilliant white with narrow green border along outer
edge surrounding a red hot center brilliant core. 
No trail, no sound, no discernible appendages. 
Physically reported by me to Ohio State Highway Patrol. Greenville C
Continuation: Radically different in everything except good farm
motor I have ever seen, including to range on jet or piston and
appearance much stranger. The size, brilliant color, lack of
sound, abrupt appearing and vanishing, added to the apparent
high speed, are quite startling.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter describing a sighting of a strange object in the sky. The letter mentions that the object was like a "small ball or metallic thing that went out in the sky and that it was not going fast at all."

Feb.21-1962
Parkersburg,

Dear Sirs:-

We talked to Mr. D-- in Ohio, and he said he saw a strange thing the latter several weeks ago, he said he saw it too. 
He wrote to you about it. He told us you want us to tell you about it also.
It was round, and it looked in the after - noon, it was like a small ball something like a satellite, lighting behind it, it was a green and yellow and a little - red all mixed in - swirls with a white rough line around it.
It was in the N-E and went to the N-W, then it passed like a balloon, swiftly all thing went out in the sky and that is all. It was not going fast at all. We called Mr. D---s, but he didn't come, he was fixing supper.
My sister's sister Vicky, who is one Mr. C-- than me saw it too - she lives here too.
Mr. C--- said it some. We are 9 years old. I got the mumps and in bed. Oh yes it was as big as a basket ball.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a letter to the editor titled "Intelligent Beings Flew UFOs Sighted Over Valley".

Text from the document:

CASE 3 7AN 62

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Intelligent Beings Flew
UFOs Sighted Over Valley

I am 29 years of age, of average intelligence, not superstitious, nor do I have hallucinations. For the past 10 years I have kept silent, like many others, for fear of being considered a nut, or depredating my position. But the time is coming that we must realize the fact that there are intelligent beings from an unknown planet using these UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects). 

How can we verify the fact that intelligent beings are controlling and using these UFOs unless the public starts telling what they are seeing and experiencing? Natural phenomena, such as meteors? 

Letters submitted for publication in this column must bear the full name and address of the writer. All letters are subject to condensation:

When does a meteor fly a horizontal plane? What about its glowing green tail?

My vision is 20-20. I'm an Air Force trained in summary quick identification, and a retired aircraft specialist with 20 years of aircraft experience. There believe that I see lights wasan't all meteors. These lights, glowing, green-ish-blue objects on a northwest heading over Wright-Patterson Air Base, at a high rate of speed, were sighted by me while eating supper.

I have sighted four UFOs in the past 10 years; two in this area, and two in the San Antonio, Tex., area. I have additional information; if told, the world-minded people would probably consider me a screwball. I'll leave well enough alone.

Would like to hear from others who have had strange experiences in order to compare information.

Fairborn.  DICK KOPSKY.
