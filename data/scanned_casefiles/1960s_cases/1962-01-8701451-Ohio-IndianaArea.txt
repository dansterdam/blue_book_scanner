Witnesses from all over Ohio Indiana area reported seeing bright green objects with long tails or trails moving very swiftly across the sky, generally S-W. Durations ranged from 1 to 6 sec. All sightings took place at night during a period of 1 hr and 35 min. Witnesses were fairly consistent in their reports regarding size, between a pea and lime at arm's length.

11. COMMENTS
Objects have same description as that given to classic meteors. During January one of the richest meteor showers takes place, the Quadrantids. Up to 30 meteors per hour can usually be observed. This shower occurs between the first and the fourth and is richest on the third. Objects viewed were probably meteors of this shower and other bright meteors (of the fireball class) which were not of the shower.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Witnesses from all over the Indiana area reported several bright objects, green to yellow color, with long tails or trails when moved very swiftly across the sky. The duration of the sightings ranged from 1-6 seconds and the paths were generally from east to west. All sightings took place at night and during a period of approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes. Witnesses were easily convinced and ground observers, estimating between 9 per and 10 miles at arms length. The objects were reported by both military and civilian witnesses and were visible and on the ground.

EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: Probably Meteors

CONCLUSION: The objects of this sighting have the same description as that ascribed to classic meteors. During January one of the richest meteor showers takes place. This shower is known as the Quadrantids and up to 30 meters per hour can be expected. This phase of the meteor activity was the most prominent on the first two or fourth and is richest on the third. The meteor shower was not a part of the fireball class which was not a part of the shower.

when sighted. Constant diminution to about 25% of original size
at disappearance: at which time it was several still several
times brighter than Venus at conjunction.
Color: Predominantly Green. A bright moon-like white nucleus
surrounded by a green halo with slightly foggy edge. Nucleus
was more sharply defined and represented approximately 25%
of over all diameter.

Trailing edge was slightly
blurred and slightly
fast-moving object.

Persistant as in any strongly
No Trail. Cast little if
any illumination on sky or landscape. Nucleus and halo pattern
some relative size and brightness. No turning to pinpoint and

Dear Sirs:-

We talked to Mr. [redacted] in Ohio, And he said he saw a strange thing the sky. Several weeks ago, he said he saw it too. He wrote to you about it. He told us you want us to tell you about it also.

It was about 5 o'clock in the after noon, it was like a snowball at the front and it looked lik a stroke of lighting behind it. It was a green and yellow and a little red all mixed in swirls with a white rough line around it.

It was in the N-E and went to the N-W then it poped like a ballon, little red thing went out in the sky and that is all.

It was not going fast at all. We called Mother outside didn't come, she was fixing supper.

My step sister Vicki, who is one Mrs. oldest than me saw it too she lives here too.

Mr. [redacted] said it seemed. We are 4 years old.

We saw a note in the newspaper about it.

I got the mumps and in bed.

Oh yes it was as big as a baseball.

Case 3 JAN 62

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Intelligent Beings Flew
UFOs Sighted Over Valley

I am 39 years of age, of average intelligence, not superstitious, nor do I have hallucinations. For the past 10 years I have kept silent, like many others, for fear of being considered a nut, or jeopardizing my position. But the time is coming that we must realize the fact that there are intelligent beings from an unknown planet using these UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects).

How can these world-is-flat people keep telling the public they are seeing natural phenomena, such as meteors?

Letters submitted for publication in this column must bear the full name and address of the writer. All letters are subject to condensation.

Doesn't a meteor have a trailing tail?
When does a meteor fly a horizontal plane?
What about its glowing green-ish-blue color?

My vision is 20-20. I'm an air force trained in gunnery quick identification, and a retired aircraft specialist with 20 years of aircraft experience. Therefore, I believe that Jan. 3rd's sighting wasn't all meteors. A glowing, green-ish-blue object flying on a horizontal plane heading over Wright-Patterson in a west, southwest direction at a high rate of speed was sighted by me while eating supper.

I have sighted four UFOs in the past 10 years; two in this area, and two in the San Antonio, Tex., area. I don't buy the explanation of heat waves, planets, weather balloons, etc. I have additional information; if told, the world-is-flat people would probably consider me a screwball. So I'll leave well enough alone.

Would like to hear from others who see these UFOs and have had strange experiences in order to compare information.

Falicon,                DICK KOPSKY.
