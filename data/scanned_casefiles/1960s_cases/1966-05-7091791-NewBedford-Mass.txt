To Whom It May Concern:

Please send me a form to fill out on a UFO sighting. I now was going to inform of a field agency about the sighting that I saw - but after the wait I have no program on UFO's by the CBS network, and the negative comment in which the handling of the possible charge attention is being handled today - I want to make known to you an unusual object opportunity point of the world, and because of this exciting my life - I am now a firm believer that the Earth of course is being watched at large by somebody, yet am not in a position to know on Earth. This is my own personal opinion at this level of activity. Yes, I was told on that most memorable day of my life - of course - perhaps the most unusual can't be in object as a matter, perhaps the way how in the country one can see the nation on Earth today. With the case maybe I will always know - not for just 10 minutes - I am a most unusual act that I will meet first the rest of my natural life.

A reply, I appreciate form - will be appreciated very much.

Sincerely,

New Bedford, Mass.
