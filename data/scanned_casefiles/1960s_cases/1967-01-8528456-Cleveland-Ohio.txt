Transcript of the text in the document:

Weighing a bit over 6 inches in height, the object was 20316 at a distance of about a mile.  

The object was cigar-shaped, white in color.

The case was investigated by the local police, who stated that the object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. 

The witness was a middle-aged housewife who had never seen anything like this before. She said the object had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound.
