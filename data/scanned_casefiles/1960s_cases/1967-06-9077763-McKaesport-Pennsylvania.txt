December 30, 1967

Report on the June 2, 1967, McKeesport, Pennsylvania case. I believe that this can be classified as "probable meteor". The shortness of duration (3 to 6 seconds depending on observer), the fact that it left trails all fits in with the meteor picture. Two witnesses disagree as to the matter of motion and I think we can discount the 90° turn reported by one since no mention whatever is made of it by the second observer. The second observer, in fact, states that there was no motion or change of course. I do not think he means in this case that there was no motion, but rather that there was no change from straight line motion. That is, no zigzagging or abrupt turns or speeding up or slowing down. In short, I could easily defend the evaluation of this case as a bright meteor before any panel of experts.

Fig. 2

On the night of June
27, 1967 Bell and I were standing up for part of my town
Solburg. Suddenly Bell
shouted "What is that" and
pointed in the south west. I
looked in the same direction
he pointed and then we noticed
saw a disk-shaped first ball
looking object. It was
roughly about 50 yds. and
firmly tilting and it appeared
2 long and 1 wide.

It came down toward
south west for some reason
made us get away. It was
at west no sound. I thought
we were looking at the same thing.
