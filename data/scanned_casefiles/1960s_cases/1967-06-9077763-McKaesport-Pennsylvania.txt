There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing a UFO sighting report from McKees Port, Pennsylvania on June 2, 1967.

December 30, 1964

Report on the June 2, 1967, McKees Port, Pennsylvania case. I believe that this can be classified as "probable meteor". The shortness of duration (3 to 6 seconds depending on observer), the fact that it left trails all fits in with the meteor picture. Two witnesses disagree as to the matter of motion and I think we can discount the 90° turn reported by one since no mention whatever is made of it by the second observer. The second observer, in fact, states that there was no motion or change of course. I do not think he means in this case that there was no motion, but rather that there was no change from straight line motion. That is, no zigzagging or abrupt turns or speeding up or slowing down. In short, I could easily defend the evaluation of this case as a bright meteor before any panel of experts.

Produced text from the image:

Baddecerall of ours 
a very bright light. Appeared to be a large object which
was hovering . Very silhueeted. Could not determine any
details , but seemed to me that this object was metal or have
a metal body and was motionless. I watched it for a few minutes.
It then seem to go behind a hill and disappear. I was amazed
and really don't know what to say about it. I thought that I
would report this to some local authorities. But I didn't know
who to contact. It was very unusual and don't know if there
are any explanation for this.
