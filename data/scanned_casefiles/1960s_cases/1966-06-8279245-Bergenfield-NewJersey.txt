The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and text instructions. The diagram appears to show a compass and directions for estimating the height and position of an unidentified object in relation to the observer.

Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass to show you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the motion and a "B" at the end, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw 3 pictures of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Output of the text in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 1 1/25/66 1 '60

33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

For this I give a report of my own sighting which took place at Bergenfield, New Jersey, on the evening of June 8, 1966. At about 9:45 pm I was outside, and observed a bright light in the western sky. This light was observed for about one and one-half to two minutes, during which time it seemed to pulse and change color. The object then moved off to the north at a rapid rate of speed, going out of sight in less than a minute.

The object appeared round or circular in shape, and seemed to be about the size of a full moon. The light itself was very bright, white, and pulsing or flashing in intensity. Colors of red, blue, and green also seemed to be present at times.

The object was observed both by myself and my wife, and was at an estimated altitude of perhaps 2000 to 3000 feet. No sound was heard. The night was clear, with only a few scattered clouds.

This is the most unusual object I have ever observed in the sky. I have no explanation for its nature or origin. I am reporting this sighting in the hope that it may be of some interest or value to your investigation of unidentified flying objects.
