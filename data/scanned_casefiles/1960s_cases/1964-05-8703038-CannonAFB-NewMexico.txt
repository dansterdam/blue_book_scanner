PORT FIRST THOUGHT OBJECT WAS AIRCRAFT ON FINAL APPROACH WITH
LANDING LIGHTS ON. DIFFERENCES IN SIZE ESTIMATION COULD HAVE
BEEN CAUSED FROM THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED AT NIGHT WITH NO
VISIBLE REFERENCES TO GAUGE THE DISTANCE AND SIZE CORRECTLY.

THIS OBJECT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE REENTERING THE
ATMOSPHERE; NOR A METEORITE. SINCE THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE AT
A RAPID RATE THERE IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A
WEATHER BALLOON, NEITHER CAN BE PROVEN BECAUSE NO PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUND, AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF
ANYTHING FALLING.
