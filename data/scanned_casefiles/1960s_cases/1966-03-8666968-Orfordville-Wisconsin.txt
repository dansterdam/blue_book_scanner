Witnessed son-medical 24 was totally against wind on its own power - moved in a backwards orbit of the moon. Satellite for a quarter of the moons orbit. Also very interested in space

Here is the text from the document:

description that it resembled an
old fashioned oval library table top he
thought that description fit the best
of all. him inclined to agree. Oh
yes, it was perfectly still
a good while of the time. Whenever
watching it & when it did move the
speed was incredibly fast & yet other time
it was so slow. Seemed to be quite powerful.
