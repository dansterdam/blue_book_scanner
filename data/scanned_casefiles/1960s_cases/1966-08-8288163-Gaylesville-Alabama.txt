11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were driving along on highway 35 when one observer noticed a small cluster of star-like objects. She focused her attention on them because they were brighter than other stars, and was clustered so closely together. A few seconds later she noticed that they were moving relative to several near by stars, seeming at a slow rate of speed. It was at this point she mentioned the objects to the other observer. He made a few comments and continued driving, then he looked up and saw the same four circular, orange-yellow, glowing objects moving from E to W. Three were at the vertices of an obtuse triangle and the fourth object seemed to be at equilibrium in the center or lead triangle and moved relatively to the other three with rapid sporadic motion fore and aft, along the direction of flight.

Factual Observation:
(12) When the center "object" (light) was in its most forward position (see Figure), there was a definite decrease in the intensity of the region where the leading object and the center object overlapped (dark spot). This occurred only once and then only for a fraction of a second but it was long enough that it was noticeable.

I didn't think that this was important until I was discussing the event with some professors at Georgia Tech. They seemed to think that it could be important. One professor in the Physics Dept. said that this could be a result of the light being polarized and the decrease in intensity could by interference, however, this would indicate that the "objects" were transparent — possibly gases.

Contact was made with scheduling section of the 17th BW, WP AFB, Ohio (7447k). They had no record of any aircraft being in the refueling track Crimson Star on the night of 26 August 66. From time to time other organizations use this track but the 17th BW knew nothing of any other aircraft being on the track on or at the time in question.

The Flip Low Altitude High Speed Training Route Chart -Eastern U.S. was used to try and determine if any aircraft on a low level training mission could have been responsible for the observation. There are several low altitude, high speed routes in the area of the sighting. The most logical route was leaked but according to the Military Training Routes Flight Intermaintain Publication it is only used during daylight hours.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted], 1967 (Sighting:26Aug66)

Dear [redacted]

Reference your letter of November 5, 1967. Your sighting has been placed in the unidentified category since we have been unable to find an explanation for your observation.

Dear sirs:

It has been over a year now since I sent you the report of a UFO sighting, or rather a UAP as I referred to it. I am interested in whether or not you have any remarks to offer as to what your findings were. Surely you have had enough time.

The report which you should have in your files was made very soon after I ( and my family ) made the sighting. Since then I have considered it for a long period of time and arrived at some possibly important findings. These findings are included in the complete report enclosed. Please consider it carefully.

I am no amateur when it comes to aerodynamics. I have completed all requirements for the Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech with the exception of the thesis. I presently am employed by NASA-MSFC here in Huntsville. From 1958 until 1962 I was employed by Thiokol Chemical Corp. as propulsion evaluation engineer on the Pershing missile system. So you see I'm not a nut!

Thank you for your time and waiting for your immediate reply.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

STATEMENT TO USAF DOBBINS AIR FORCE BASE

STATEMENT

Friday, 26 August 1966 my wife, three children and I were traveling from Atlanta, Georgia to Huntsville, Alabama. Our trip began on US 14 North to Highway 20, through Rome, Georgia to the State line where Highway 20 became Highway 9. Four miles past the State line we intercepted Highway 35 at approximately 8:51 pm CST. It was at this time that my wife first saw a small cluster of star-like objects. We turned North onto 35 and the objects, which my wife noticed were then at our upper right (about two o'clock). She said her attention rested on them because they were brighter than other stars and because they were clustered so closely together. She said nothing to me at this time.

A few seconds later, she noticed that they were moving relative to several "near by stars." They moved toward our right, away from us and down - seemingly at a slow rate of speed. It was then that she first made comment of the objects to me. She said "There's an airplane flying up there." She pointed in the general direction. I paid little attention to this. Approximately one minute later, she said "I't's coming down. I think it's going to land." To this I commented that commercial airplanes just do not land in the middle of God's Country. She then looked over toward me and then back out the window and said, "That's the biggest airplane I have ever seen; It's going to land!"

It was then that I looked up (about 11 o'clock) directly in a plane containing the objects and our stationary and approximately normal to the road. The objects had made a smooth maneuver turning from East to West and passing over us. I immediately applied the brakes bringing the car to a stop on the side of the road. I rolled down the window while the car was slowing down.

I saw four circular, orange-yellow, glowing, objects moving from East to West. Three were at the vertices of an obtuse triangle moving with the obtuse vertex in the direction of flight. The fourth object seemed to be at equilibrium in the center of the triangle and moved relative to the other three with rapid sporadic motion fore and aft, along the direction of flight, once leaving the confines of the triangle itself in the art direction.

The objects passed directly overhead normal to the highway and off into the distance.

There was no noticeable wind on the ground, the temperature in Fort Payne, Ala. was 65° F (approximately 16 miles away), the sky was clear - so clear that I could have easily driven my car by the bright moon light.

(here was a 3/4 full moon), which was behind me and shining over my left shoulder. The objects were far off in the west at 8:55 (± 1/2 min) pm CST (no daylight saving time).

When I rolled down the window and the objects were directly overhead, and for all time thereafter during the observation, the objects produced no detectable sound!

FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:

(1) The size of the objects when directly overhead had a relative diameter from 1/5 to 1/4 that of the moon's diameter or about the size of a fingernail 30° from the eye.

(2) The objects' formation increased in size approximately seven to ten times.

(3) The time of final observation was 8:55 pm CST ± 1/2 minute.

(4) The objects were circular.

(5) The triangular pattern was maintained by the objects for the duration of the observation.

(6) The color of the light received was orange-yellow when they were at maximum size and bright white when first sighted.

(7) The objects made a smooth maneuver, burning from East to West.

(8) There was no noticeable wind on the ground and visibility was excellent for that time of night.

(9) The moon was bright and about 3/4 full.

(10) All objects were of equal intensity and were glowing when closest. (The center object was possibly a shade darker than the outer three.)

(11) There was no detectable sound produced by the objects.

*(12) When the center "object" (light) was in its most forward position (see figure), there was a definite decrease in the intensity of the region where the leading object and the center object overlapped (dark spot). This occurred only once and then only for a fraction of a second but it was long enough that it was noticeable. COMMENT: I didn't think this was important until I was discussing the event with some professors at Georgia Tech. They seemed to think this could be important, and a professor in the Physics Department said that this could be a result of the light being out of phase and the decrease in intensity caused by interference, however.

This statement was sent to the Air Force the next day as an appendix to official report. I believe it to be the most significant factual observation.

this would indicate that the "objects" were transparent — possibly gases.

NON-FACTUAL IMPRESSIONS:
(1) The objects appeared to be higher than about 500 feet.

(2) If it were assumed that their speed was that of a conventional aircraft (about 300 mph), I would estimate their altitude at approximately 3000 feet. I do not mean that they were at 3000 feet, I am only trying to establish the angular velocity or their position vector. My best guess would be 500 feet when directly overhead with speed of 50 mph, diameter of each object 8-feet.

(3) The time from first sighting to the time when they passed overhead was about 2 to 3 minutes.

(4) The time from passing overhead was approximately 1 to 2 minutes. (These are only good guesses.)

(5) The airport tower controller in Huntsville the next morning told me that there was only one small aircraft near the sighting area, but that it was South of there.

(6) I, personally, believe that it was not a conventional airplane.

(7) I leave open only the obscure possibility of balloons; however, I intuitively do not believe it was balloons, because of the rapid motion of the center object and the cancellation of light when the two crossed.

(8) If they were balloons at an altitude of 500 feet, and if assuming 2 is good, then the speed of the balloons would be 50 mph. Recalling that there was little or no noticeable wind on the ground, this would hardly seem realistic for such clear weather conditions. If they were balloons and farther away, they would have been traveling faster and they would have been very large.

(9) I do not believe the objects were reflection, since I saw them clearly with my head outside of the window. Also, since there were no clouds; I do not believe it was a reflection of a light on a cloud. (Absolutely a clear sky.)

(10) I am considerably (but not dogmatically) sure of what it was not. The objects were clearly seen by my wife, all of my three children, and myself. The above observations, as stated, is true and contains our

ESTABLISHMENT OF MODEL OF THE U.A.P. (U.F.O.)

COMMENT 1: The "lights" (objects) were seen by my family and me as distinctly as you see the figures which are included herein. There was absolutely no blur and their outline was sharp.

COMMENT 2: I arrived at this solution about two weeks after the sighting, but waited for the Air Force to contact me. - They never have. - I then made these calculations which only establish necessary conditions for validity of the model. However, the electrical power lines were not noted by me until May 1967 when I saw them on the enclosed map while calculating the longitude and latitude of sighting when the objects were nearly overhead.

May 12, 1967

Establishment of Model of U.A.P. (Unusual Aerial Phenomenon or U.F.O.)

The triangular pattern of U.A.P. (U.F.O.) - (lights) never changed during the sighting. (Since my wife made initial observation, this statement is based upon detailed discussion with her.) - They definitely maintained Formation pattern after they passed over the road traveling west. (Center object in motion relative to other three.)

When first sighted, they had acute angles and were as small as "near by" stars with the center object not moving noticeable relative to others. However, my wife mentioned that the formation was moving (recall that we were traveling at approximately 50 mph) relative to the "near by" star. See below.

Figure 1. Formation of U.A.P. when first seen by my wife. Formation moving very slowly southwest.

(a) moving slowly (relatively)
(b) center light moving with formation uniformly
(c) color bright as brightest stars - but small

Notice acute angles of triangle formed by outer three objects. Also lights appeared high in the NEN (or about 25° to 35° clockwise from the north)(road direction is 10° counterclockwise from the north).

As "lights" approached us (turning westward) they appeared as shown in the figure below (see point (c) on trajectory of overall colored figure) from our line of sight.

Figure 2.
Trajectory of formation

(a) Approximate formation (scale)
(b) Center object was now "jumping around" but not as much as when overhead.

Note: Obtuse angle at top.

D-29


- page 18 -

When "lights" passed over the car (station wagon), I first saw them. The figure below is a close to scale as I can estimate, however, the center "object" ("light") was "jumping" backward and forward relative to the other "lights" and with a frequency of about 3 or 4 cycles per second. (Notice the obtuse angle formed by the leading light.)

Figure 3.

As viewed when looking nearly directly straight up.

Most forward position of center light

See position "D" on trajectory of full size drawing.

Estimated point of equilibrium

Most aft position of center light.

The dotted circles show limits of movement of center ("object") light. When in the most forward position, as shown in the figure above, the center light "overlapped" the leading light. - When this occurred there was a "blink" as shown below.

My wife and I are both positive of this.

CALCULATION OF FREQUENCY OF CENTER LIGHT BASED
UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS AN
AERO-ELECTROMAGNETIC PHENOMENON

D-32


- page 21 -

Assumptions:

(1) Objects (lights) were 500 feet above the level of the road. (My best guess)

(2) Each object was approximately 9.3 feet in diameter.
(Based upon measurement of finger* 30 inches from the eye and the estimate that the diameter of the lights were approximately the size of the (my) index finger nail.) (* = 0.5 inch)
*Actual measured as 27"

[A diagram is included showing measurements of 21", 60", and 500 ft estimated (Best Guess)]

Mathematical calculations:
0.5/27 = d/500 x 12 → d = 6000/64 = 111.1 inches = 9.26 ft
d = 9.3 ft ≈ (3 meters)

(3) Assume three outside objects form equilateral triangle.
(All angles = 60°)

(4) Guess from scaled drawing that, sides of triangle are 10 meters.

(5) Assume angle of attack (α) about 30° or so and get height of center light at maximum of about 8 meters.

(6) Assume the "lights" were electrons (electron clouds) and motion unaffected by atmosphere (assume vacuum).

(7) Assume positive charge for three outside lights and negative charge for moving center "object" (light).

(8) Assume dynamic stability - this can probably be shown to be true only for the dynamic case.

Personal Comments:

May 18, 1967

1. After considering the facts as stated in the report to the Air Force, I have concluded that the unusual aerial phenomenon that we observed was an aero-electromagnetic phenomenon - most probably a result of natural atmospheric conditions combined with the electrical field near-by on the ground and the magnetic field of the earth.

2. I believe that the "lights" were gases, electrically charged, which derived their motion from a force which was a combination of the nearby electrical field and the magnetic field of earth.

3. I think others, working in the field of U.F.O. or U.A.P. (unusual aerial phenomenon) should be made aware of this observation - especially the "BLINK" which occurred when the two "Objects" (lights) crossed. - This could have a definite effect upon the establishment of the cause of such phenomenon.

4. NASA should not ignore the U.A.P. since it could possibly lead to new ideas for interplanetary probes for mapping the magnetic fields of other planets.

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of November 5, 1967, in which you inquired as to the identification of your UFO sighting that you reported sometime ago.

We regret that we failed to notify you that your sighting could not be identified. You submitted a good report, but it was the only one received and the particular incident cannot be correlated with other known objects observable in the area at the time.

Should you ever sight another flying object you cannot identify, if you will report it immediately to the USAF Investigator at the nearest Air Force base, you will have a better opportunity to have your sighting identified.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report will be of interest. Thank you for your interest in the Air Force UFO program.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. SMILES

1. Our office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object sighting which occurred in the Gaylesville, Alabama area on 26 August at approximately 2050 CST.

2. The observer reported a small cluster of star-like objects that appeared to be moving relative to the stars. The cluster was glowing yellow to the east but made a smooth maneuver turning from east to west and passing over the observer. The observer saw four circular, orange-yellow, glowing objects moving toward the west. Three were at the vertices of an 6 tube triangle moving with the obverse in the direction of flight. The fourth object seemed to be at equilibrium in the center of the triangle and moved relative to the other three with rapid sporadic motion fore and aft, along the direction of flight, once leaving the confines of the triangle itself in one direction.

3. Request information on any aircraft activity or other stimuli known by your agency that could have been responsible for the sighting. If records are available, request positive or negative radar confirmation to so any objection could be made at time of observation. Any assistance which you can provide is appreciated.

STATEMENT

Friday, 26 August 1966 my wife, three children and I were traveling from Atlanta, Georgia to Huntsville, Alabama. Our trip began on US 41 North to Highway 20, through Rome, Georgia to the State line where Highway 20 becomes Highway 9. Four miles past the State line we intersected Highway 35 at approximately 8:51 pm CST. It was at this time that my wife first saw a small cluster of star-like objects. We turned North onto 35 and the objects, which my wife noticed were then at our upper right (about two o'clock). She said her attention rested on them because they were brighter than other stars and because they were clustered so closely together. She said nothing to me at this time.

A few seconds later, she noticed that they were moving relative to seven "near by stars". They moved toward our right, away from us and down - seemingly at a slow rate of speed. It was then that she first made comment of the objects to me. She said "There's an airplane flying up there." She pointed in the general direction. I paid little attention to this. Approximately one minute later, she said "It's coming down; I think it's going to land." I commented that commercial airplanes just do not land in the middle of God's Country. She then looked over toward me and then back out the window and said, "That's the biggest airplane I have ever seen; It's going to land!"

It was then that I looked up (about 11 o'clock) directly in a plane containing the objects and out stationwagon and approximately normal to the road. The objects had made a smooth maneuver turning from East to West and passing over us. I immediately applied the brakes bringing the car to a stop on the side of the road. I rolled down the window while the car was slowing down.

I saw four circular, orange-yellow, glowing, objects moving from East to West. Three were at the vertices of an obtuse triangle moving with the obverse vertex in the direction of flight. Fourthly object seemed to be at equilibrium in the center of the triangle and moved relative to the other three with rapid sporadic motion fore and aft, along the direction of flight, once leaving the confines of the triangle in the act of direction.

The objects passed directly overhead normal to the highway and off into the distance.

There was no noticeable wind on the ground, the temperature in Fort Payne, Ala. was 65° F (approximately 16 miles away), the sky was clear - so clear that I could have easily driven my car by the bright moon light (there was a 3/4 full moon), which was behind me and shining over my left shoulder. The objects were far off at 8:55 (± 5 min) pm CST.

When I rolled down the window and the objects were directly overhead and for all time thereafter during the observation, the objects produced no detectable sound.

FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:
(1) The size of the objects when directly overhead had a relative diameter from 1/5 to 1/4 that of the moon's diameter or about the size of a fingernail 30" from the eye.

(2) The objects' formation increased in size approximately seven to ten times.

(3) The time of final observation was 8:55 pm CST ± ½ min.

(4) The objects were circular.

(5) The triangular pattern was maintained by the objects for the duration of the observation.

(6) The color of the light received by us was orange-yellow when they were at maximum size and bright white when first sighted.

(7) The objects made a smooth maneuver, turning from East to West.

(8) There was no noticeable wind at the ground and visibility was excellent from that time of night.

(9) The moon was bright and about 3/4 full.

(10) All objects were of equal intensity and were glowing when closest.

(11) There was no detectable sound produced by the objects.

NON-FACTUAL IMPRESSIONS:
(1) The objects appeared to be higher than about 500 feet.

(2) If it were assumed that their speed was that of a conventional aircraft (about 300 mph), I would estimate their altitude at approx. 3000 feet. I do not mean that they were at 3000 feet, I am only trying to establish the angular velocity of their position vector.

Here is the text from the document:

(3) The time from first sighting to the time when they passed overhead was about 2 to 3 min.

(4) The time from passing overhead was approximately 1 to 2 min. (These are only good guesses.)

(5) The airport tower controller told me that there was only one small aircraft near the sighting area, but that it was South of here.

(6) I, personally, believe that it was not a conventional airplane.

(7) I leave open only the obscure possibility of balloons; however, I intuitively do not believe it was balloons.

(8) If they were balloons at an altitude of 500 feet, and if assumption 2 is good, then the speed of the balloon would be 50 m.p.h. Recalling that there was little or no noticeable wind on the ground, this would hardly seem realistic. If they were balloons and farther away, they would have been traveling faster and they would have been very large.

(9) I do not believe the objects were reflection, since I saw them clearly with my head outside of the window. Also, since there were no clouds, I do not believe it was a reflection of a light on a cloud.

(10) I am considerably (but not dogmatically) sure of what it is not.

The objects were clearly seen by my wife, all of my three children, and myself. The above observations, as stated, is true and contains our best knowledge of what actually happened.

NOTE: Sighting reported to Fort Payne, Ala. Police at 9:20 CST.
