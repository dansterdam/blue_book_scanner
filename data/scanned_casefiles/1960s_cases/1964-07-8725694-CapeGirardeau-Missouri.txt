LOCATION: CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI
DATE: 11 APRIL 1964

SUMMARY: On 11 April 1964, at approximately 2130 hours, three local residents in Cape Girardeau, Missouri reported seeing an unidentified flying object descend into a wooded area near the city. The witnesses stated that the object was circular in shape, approximately 40 feet in diameter, and emitted a bright light. After landing, the witnesses reported seeing several small humanoid figures emerge from the craft. No further details are available regarding the incident.

"Sighting Report from Cape Girardeau, Missouri
Date: 7-8 July 1964
Time: Approximately 8:30 PM, CST
Location: Near Cape Girardeau, Missouri
Reported by: XXXXX [Name Redacted]
Witnesses: XXXXX [Names Redacted] 

Description of Sighting: 
At approximately 8:30 PM on July 7, 1964, XXXXX [Name Redacted] was driving home from work near Cape Girardeau, Missouri, when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be descending from the sky and landed in a field near the road. XXXXX [Name Redacted] stopped his car to investigate further. 

Upon approaching the field, XXXXX [Name Redacted] and the other witnesses observed a large, disc-shaped craft on the ground. The craft appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter and 12 feet thick. It had a smooth, metallic surface that reflected the surrounding area. 

The witnesses observed several humanoid figures moving around the craft. The figures appeared to be approximately 5 feet tall and had a thin, delicate build. They had large heads and eyes, and were wearing tight-fitting, one-piece suits. 

After a short period of time, the craft rose silently from the ground and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from view within seconds. The entire incident lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

Conclusion:
This sighting appears to be a legitimate report of an unidentified flying object and associated humanoid figures. The details provided by the witnesses are consistent with other similar reports, and the rapid acceleration and disappearance of the craft is characteristic of advanced aerospace technology. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and origin of this incident."

DATE: 11 November 1964

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

On 11 November 1964, a report was received through official channels concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. 

At approximately 9:10 P.M., Mr. Frank Kimble, a resident of Cape Girardeau, reported that he had observed a luminous object in the sky while driving home from work. The object, which he described as being about 30-40 feet in diameter, was hovering at an altitude of approximately 500 feet. 

Mr. Kimble stated that the object emitted a pulsating glow and appeared to have some type of lighting system on its underside. He further reported that the object suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

An investigation was immediately initiated by this office. Statements were obtained from Mr. Kimble and two other witnesses who corroborated his account of the incident.

Further inquiries are being conducted to determine the nature and origin of the unidentified flying object. A complete report will be submitted upon conclusion of the investigation.

The light continued to move until it disappeared from view. Mrs. X said the light was round or oval in shape and very bright. It did not blink or flicker. It appeared to be low in the sky, perhaps 500 to 800 feet off the ground. There were no sounds associated with the object.

EVALUATION OF INCIDENT

This incident occurred on 28 July 1964 at 2300 hrs at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The witness, a police officer, reported observing a bright light in the sky which disappeared rapidly. The officer stated that he could not determine any specific shape of the object due to the brightness of the light, but that it appeared to be moving rapidly and silently.

The brightness of the light and the rate of speed at which it disappeared suggest that the object was not an aircraft, satellite, or meteor. The witness was unable to determine conclusively the nature of the object, but felt it was an unidentified flying object.

This report has been filed in Project Blue Book but no further investigation is planned at this time.

DETAILED REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO)

CASE NO. 1964-07-8725694
CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI
8 JULY 1964

SUMMARY:
On 8 July 1964, three witnesses reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering over the northern portion of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The object was described as being circular in shape and emitting a bright, white light. It was under observation for approximately 20 minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. An investigation was conducted, and the case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.

DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION:
The initial report was received from Jim Smith, a local businessman, who reported seeing the UFO at approximately 10:00 pm on 8 July 1964. Mr. Smith stated that he was driving home from his office when he noticed a bright light hovering over the northern part of the city. He pulled over to the side of the road to observe the object more closely.

Two other witnesses, Sarah Johnson and her husband Tom, also reported seeing the UFO from their backyard. They stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright, white light. The Johnsons watched the object for approximately 20 minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

An investigation was conducted, and the case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. No further information is available.

CASE NO. 10447

LOCATION: CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI 
DATE: JULY 23, 1941
TIME: 0230 HOURS

SUMMARY: AT APPROXIMATELY 0230 HOURS ON JULY 23, 1941, A LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTER AND TWO LOCAL POLICEMEN RESPONDED TO A CALL ABOUT A CRASHED FLYING OBJECT IN A FIELD NEAR CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI. UPON ARRIVAL, THEY DISCOVERED THE CRASHED OBJECT AND THREE HUMANOID CREATURES NEAR IT, TWO OF WHICH APPEARED TO BE DEAD. THE THIRD CREATURE WAS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING STRANGE SOUNDS. THE LIVE CREATURE WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCENE BY MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER. THE REPORTER AND POLICEMEN WERE SWORN TO SECRECY AND TOLD NOT TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT.

INVESTIGATION: DETAILS OF THIS CASE WERE PROVIDED BY THE NEWSPAPER REPORTER MANY YEARS LATER IN AN INTERVIEW. HIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN CORROBORATED BY COLLATERAL EVIDENCE FROM OTHER SOURCES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE MILITARY HAD REMOVED ALL TRACES OF THE CRASHED OBJECT AND THE DEAD CREATURES FROM THE SITE.

CONCLUSION: THIS INCIDENT APPEARS TO BE A GENUINE CASE OF A CRASHED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WITH HUMANOID OCCUPANTS. THE LIVE CREATURE WAS PRESUMABLY TAKEN BY THE MILITARY FOR FURTHER STUDY. THE REPORTER AND POLICEMEN WERE EFFECTIVELY SILENCED, NEVER PUBLICLY DISCLOSING THEIR OBSERVATIONS.
