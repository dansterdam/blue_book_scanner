Kent, Ohio

KENT, OHIO Dec. 12, 1962 6:00 PM A woman from Twin Lakes called the Kent Record-Courier. She spotted a large white light, which changed to a bluish-white as it neared the earth. It appeared to be dropping into the wooded area between Lake St. & University hts. The light dropped to the earth in about 5 seconds.

[Clipped newspaper article titled "Saucer Lands in Italy"]

In the early hours of the 18th of December, 1962, a watchman on duty in the courtyard of a suburban sector in Milan, Italy, reported to police that he had seen a "flying saucer" after it landed in the courtyard. The little probe broke next to the watchman. Then another small man assured the first one back into the ship which took off. Police inquired upon the report, but launched no official investigation. More will be printed on this incident when more details are received.

ARLO EINSTEIN . . . . . . . . January - 1963
A mystery object landed in 40 ft. of water and mud near the Midway gravel pit just off the Seattle-Tacoma Freeway on 19 December 1962. Welder John Liedtke, who reported the incident to the State Highway Patrol, said he saw a lot of sparks flying, thought it was a car in trouble. Then the object exploded into a big ball of fire & smoke filled the area. State Patrol Headquarters said there was a perfectly round hole, 15' across in the mud where the object landed. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, which carried the story, did not elucidate on physical description of the object before it exploded, nor whether or not there was a search for debris in the pit.

MRS. BRIGGS: On December 19th a mystery object, which exploded in to a dark mudpit of fire, landed in 100 feet of mud and water near a gravel pit in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington. A welder at the gravel pit reported the sighting to state police, and stated: "I saw all those sparks flying and the only thing I could think of was that a car was in trouble. Then it exploded into a big ball of fire and the area was covered with thick smoke." The police said that they found a perfectly round hole, 15 feet in diameter, in the mud where the object landed.

"LITTLE MEN" SIGHTED IN ITALY: A policeman in Milan, Italy, claims to have seen a saucer with the humanoids inside it, just before he went off duty on the night of December 20th. The policeman, named Francesco Rizzi, made the following statement to me. It came from a flying saucer which had an aluminum-colored appearance. I saw two strange-looking inhabitants inside. They were not more than three feet tall, and were dressed in luminous clothing, with strange black helmets on their heads. One of them came out of the saucer and gestured to his companion, and then got back into the saucer, which then took off vertically.

The first creature looked at me for a moment, who appeared in the hatchway, and then got back into the saucer, which then took off vertically.

BIG "SAUCER 'FLAP'" CONTINUES IN ARGENTINA: The sensational South American "flap" described in our December issue is still continuing in Argentina, according to the latest Spanish-language articles we have received from our clipping services.

Of the sightings pertaining to the month of December, the most interesting occurred at an airport near Buenos Aires on the 22nd of that month. At 3 a.m. a Panagra airliner approaching the International Airport of Ezeiza radioed the control tower to ask about a strange light near the runway. At almost exactly the same time, the UFO was noticed by the pilot of another plane that was about to take off. The control tower operator, named Horacio Alora, also saw the object, and described it as being "the color of fire, and of great brightness." It rose to about 10 yards above the ground, hovered there for a few seconds, and finally took off at great speed toward the northeast. The sighting was confirmed by a second control tower operator named Mario Pastrano.

ARGENTINA-BUENOS AIRES-12/23/62-12 P.M.
A glowing football-shaped object sat down
on the runway at the Ezeiza Int'l Airport. Mr Alora, a technician, and Besutti, tower operator, observed the landing of the unconventional aerial object from the control tower. The object parked approx 1-1/5 mi from the tower. The witness and football shaped.

At the time of the sighting, and Alora were controlling the landing of a Panamerican DC-8, and paid special attention to the object during the landing. Visibility was excellent. When the object left, it ascended vertically at high speed, to an altitude of 1500', then disappeared over the horizon in level flight.

Stationary Object

The Adelaide Mail on January
5 reported this strange sighting:
"The 'saucer' was first sighted
at 1:30 a.m. today (December 29,
1962) by Mr. Tom Hoey, a farmer, ten miles from Clifton, Millicent, said the object first appeared as the brightest star in
the sky, but was closer to the
earth than the moon.

"It was very large, very
bright, and was fringed on one
side by an orange glow, he said.
At about 2:30 a.m., it seemed to
move slowly across the sky, then
slowly away. Then the larger one
broke away and two smaller ones
and finally disappeared below the
horizon. He said, 'This saucer
light seemed to be quite close.'

"Mr. Hoey said he had not
seen the smaller light return to
the original object. A Towoomba
photographer who visited the site
for a Brisbane newspaper said
there was definitely something
there.

"It looked like a shining disc,"
he said.

"By four o'clock this afternoon
the object had not moved, but
cloud cover prevented observers
from gaining a clear view. The
R.A.A.F. cannot track the object
with radar.

"A spokesman at the Amberley air base (30 miles from Brisbane) said tonight the R.A.A.F.
mainly trained surveillance radar
on objects reported, but the
Clifton object was too far away.
The radar, designed for airfield
approach, had a range to only
42 miles."

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for November 24, 1962

Impressive Stellar Display
Jupiter, Mars and Saturn will shine in the evening sky and the spacecraft Mariner will make its first close-up observation of Venus in December, James Stokley reports.

ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE of them appears in a telescope at any time, the planets are visible in the evening this month, bright and distinct—all—and the one that stands out most is Jupiter, which sets in the west about midnight on the first and about two hours earlier on the 31st in the constellation of Aquarius, the waterbearers, and its astronomical magnitude is minus 1.9.

The maps show the appearance of the skies about 10 p.m. (your own kind of standard time) at the beginning of the month, 9 p.m. on the 15th and 8 p.m. on the 31st. At these times Jupiter is rising, but not high enough to be visible. It is located in Leo, the lion. By midnight this will be well above the eastern horizon. Mars' magnitude will be minus 0.1, or about as bright as Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. It will be brighter than any nearby star, and its red color will make it easy to identify.

Saturn in Capricornus
The third December evening planet is Saturn, in Capricornus, the sea goat. It sets about an hour before the time for which the maps are drawn. At about 8 p.m., on the first of the month, it will be low in the west, just below Aquarius, in which Jupiter stands.

Jupiter, Saturn and Mars are all planets—members of the solar system, like earth, and they move around the sun which illuminates them.

The stars, however, are distant suns, each shining by its own light. The brightest shown is Sirius, also called the dog star that is in Canis Major, the great dog, low in the sky. Sirius, and its magnitude is minus 1.6. This star is nearly as bright as Jupiter because the brighter an object, the lower its magnitude, negative meaning denoting the very brightest objects. However, being a star, Sirius appears as a point of light, while planets like Jupiter appear to scintillate, or "twinkle."

Above Canis Major you can see the magnificent constellation of Orion, the warrior, with Rigel to the right. Taurus, the bull, is above Orion, with ruddy Aldebaran, another star in its belt. The group also includes two first-magnitude stars: Betelgeuse to the left, and Rigel to the right. Taurus, the bull, is above Orion, with ruddy Aldebaran, another star in its belt. The left star sees Gemini, the twins, with Castor and Pollux, the later being lower. Below them is Canis Minor, the lesser dog, with Procyon, while above them stands Auriga, the charioteer, with Capella. Both of these stars are low and prominent. This region of the sky, now visible in the south.

Mariner will continue its mission that would land there. Scientists of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) who planned it designed the flight path so that scientific instruments on board could measure the temperature of the planet and its atmosphere. They expect them to reveal much about the planet's environment, make up of Venus and its gaseous mantle. This atmosphere, which is continually cloudy, perpetually shrouds the bright planet.

Mariner's flight path was altered on Sept. 4 on command from the earth—the first time such a complicated maneuver had ever been performed successfully by a spacecraft in flight. This put it into a long curved path which, after 109 days and 180,000,000 miles of travel, will bring it within 21,000 miles of Venus on Dec. 14.

Mariner Will Telemeters Data
During the cruise and the encounter with Venus, a continuing series of tests with the spacecraft will be made to check its performance. As the sensors of its six experiments receive information, they feed it to a data conditioning system (DCS), located in the base of the craft. The DCS prepares the information for transmission to earth in the form of a digital code.

All the data collected cannot be transmitted at the same time, so an electronic clock has been built into the DCS. This controls the equipment so that the receiver "knows" to expect certain data at a time for about one second. After 20.16 seconds the

MARIETTA, OHIO, Dec. 1, 1962- 9:30 PM:
A large person, tear-drop shaped object was
seen falling at a sharp angle ahead of a car driven by Larry Myers, of FSIC. His
Mother and Father were also witnesses.
Mr. Myers said the object looked to be
as large as a man's head, and not very far
away. It burned out at a low level.
WOOSTER: Two women verified this sighting
of the given area. Their sighting
and that of Myers, agreed as to time,
color shape.
RTE. 8 - Two hours later two persons driv-
ing south observed a huge, livid green
fireball with a tail, fall at a steep angle in a northerly direction out of the
southern sky. It also seemed close and
didn't die out until it was at tree-top
level. Duration - a few seconds.
CANTON-AKRON: The clear skies and the
FLASHING STARS, that brilliant bluish star
in the SE, caused many to call ---and many
to wonder. It isn't a UFO just the star
SIRUS flashing red, green, blue and white.

LOCAL SIGHTINGS: GREATER AKRON AREA (SE)...
The observer was a high school student. The
report was filled out in the first week of
December, 1962.

The time was 8:00 a.m.; the sky was partly
cloudy.     To the left and near the sun, he
first saw a single object which he described as crescent-shaped, and the crescent was
in a vertical position. As he continued to
watch, the crescent tipped down to a horizontal position. After an undetermined time
he saw seven (7) smaller shapeless objects
"fade into view."     These objects were
strung out horizontally to the left of the
larger crescent-shaped object. The object
remained stationary for the 5-10 minutes
that the observer watched them. He said
that if they moved at all, they might have
been slightly higher in elevation. The objects seemed to have the color of reflected
light but he wasn't sure whether they were
self-luminous or not.     The sighting ended
when the objects faded from view. The size
of the crescent-shaped object was compared
to a large pea at arm's length; the smaller
objects were about the size of airplane
lights seen at night, maybe larger. They
seemed to be far away according to the
witness.

RIVERSIDE, CALIF-Dec 2, 1962, 9PM-Mr & Mrs
Jack E Woodward were returning home on the
freeway. They say a fiery object fell from
an altitude of several hundred ft, as they
watched-the object fell upon the roof of
the Jack Brazil home. They drove to the Brazil's, and alerted them. With a neighbor's
hose, they extinguished the small fire that
had started. The object was a basketball-
sized chunk of clear plastic. No one knows
what it was or where it came from.
