Dear Sir:

I write to inform you of the U.S.A.F. contact on the night of February 10, 1969, from 7:45 until 7:55 I witnessed the flight of a UFO. I am not a crackpot, nor am I seeking publicity. I am merely informing you for what good it may do. I'll admit, I am interested in UFOs and have a few books concerning them, but I also have been told that I have the first review I have viewed. The nervous way you think we may be fooled by conventional objects or natural phenomena, but I assure you there was nothing conventional or natural about this.

I first noticed the "thing" outside my window of above a field. It hovered at the glowing brightly with a bright yellow-flight. It moved to my left very slowly, still glimmering. It started to change color. I'll went from yellow-orange and later to bright red. It picked up speed, still moving left until it was at about the center of my

view. At first we just for minutes, and then
came back to the night about 4 the way. By road
toward bright red it stopped for seconds,
a increasingly moving away, from me disappeared.
I up in mind that this early in the evening
there were no stars on the sky, nor the moon
yet visible. At sun had gone down (or page
as it could not have been a reflection off
the top of a weather balloon, and it was
too big to have been a bird's head, and
it was moving against the wind.

If you want more information, please contact

Yours very truly,
