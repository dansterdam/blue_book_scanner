10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Dully round star-like objects. In same position as Venus often takes in relation to a near moon disc seen only in the evening. Reddish Venus in size and brightness, moved slightly toward the NE, circled clock wise and hand along the Southeast at a very rapid speed. Disappeared from sight at about 30-40 deg elevation. Speed was faster than jet a/c. Seemed very high while circling.

11. COMMENTS
Short duration rules out balloon. The manner and rule out controlled objects. Possible Venus in size and brightness, the possibility exists that there was an orientation on speed. Duration is consistent with the speed indicated. No further received in letter and no follow up information requested. Report listed as insufficient data. Time was reduced probability of checking on information.

BLOOMINGTON, ILLINOIS
TELEPHONE

June 19, 1961

Commanding Officer
United States Air Force Base
Chanute Field
Rantoul, Illinois

Dear Sir:

This is a report of a sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object.

June 18, 1961, I was lying on my back on the grass near the swimming pool at the Bloomington Country Club looking directly up into the sky. The time was about 9:20 P.M. There were no clouds in the sky at that time, the wind velocity at ground level was practically zero and was slightly in all directions as previously noted. I was wearing polarized sun glasses which contain no optical correction.

I was very slightly correction only for reading and television and have always been slightly far sighted.

The moon, in its first quarter, was almost directly overhead. I was looking at the moon when I noticed a shiny round object which I thought was a star. It was also directly overhead. The moon, in the first position, was Venus or Orion. In relation to a new moon when it is seen in the early evening. It occurred to me after a few seconds that a star might well be washing at this particular hour of this particular day, although the object seemed Venus in size and brightness.

As I watched the object it moved slightly toward the northwest, circled clockwise and headed almost due southwest at a very rapid speed and disappeared from sight about 100 to 150 degrees above the horizon. As it moved southwest at speed, I would estimate was three or four times as fast as the jet military aircraft which we frequently see flying over Bloomington. The object seemed to be very high and after circling proceeded in a straight line.

The entire episode took place in about 10/15 seconds from the time I first noticed the object until it disappeared from sight. There were several other people present at the time but I was not able, only a light down at that moment, could tell to the attention of the others it had disappeared before they could see it.

I am 25 years of age and hold the rank of Lieut. USAF (Ret.). I have never been 31 and my each one of these reports I have filed with anyone who has done so. I hope that this information will be of some value.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature and other details redacted]
