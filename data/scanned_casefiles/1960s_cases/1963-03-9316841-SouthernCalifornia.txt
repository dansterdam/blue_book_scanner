Silver obj observed fm F-101's at 50,000 ft. Obj above at 80 dgr elevation 10 dgr off port. Sighting between Ventura & Santa Barbara. In sight 5-10 mins. Obj made turn & lost sight of obj. Estimated obj to be at 1,000,000 ft range. 500 knots. 2. Bright light resembling star, white with out features, no control or exhaust. High against clear blue sky. Object 30 dgr above horizon. Disappeared instantaneously to East like lightbulb going out. Reported fm Santa Barbara, Vandenburg, Oxnard area. Sighting all visual.

11. COMMENTS: PE Mugu made high altitude shot w/metallic parachute to 230,000 ft. Parachute w/package drifted to SW 132 NM fm release point. This obj over southern California at the time. Consider motion consistent w/metallic parachute. Info received fm Pt Mugu Range Officer, Lt Apley. LA Air Defense sector had been notified of shot since package contained chaff, released.

This image appears to be a topographical map with various grid references, elevation markers, and geographical features. The map shows multiple regions with alphanumeric designations like R-279, R-276, CF, CE, DE, EE, and FF. There are numerous elevation numbers scattered across the map, ranging from around 3000 to 8500. Several locations are marked, including San Antonio, San Bernardino, and what seems to be various desert and mountain regions. The map includes a grid with distance markers and appears to cover a large area of what looks like Southern California. The map is in black and white and contains intricate topographical lines indicating terrain variations.

This image appears to be a topographical map of Southern California, specifically the coastal and inland areas around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. The map includes various geographical markers, elevation lines, grid coordinates, and location names such as:

- San Simeon
- Morro Bay
- San Luis Obispo
- Pismo Beach
- Santa Maria
- Point Arguello
- Santa Barbara

The map has several grid reference lines labeled with letters like PF, QF, AF, PE, QE, AE, and includes elevation scales and coordinates. There's a note in the top left area that appears to be partially illegible, but mentions something about "elevation" and "being conducted."

The map shows terrain features, roads, and what seem to be geographical boundaries, with numerous numerical elevation markers throughout the map.

Here is the text I can read from the image:

1040 MOJAVE DESERT
ELEVATIONS IN FEET
WORLD AERO

The image appears to be a topographical map of the Mojave Desert region in Southern California, showing various grid sections (PG, DJ, QG, EJ, AG, etc.) with elevation markings and geographical features. The map includes cities, roads, and terrain contours. The map is labeled "WORLD AERO" at the top right and "1040 MOJAVE DESERT" at the top left.

UFO INCIDENT
6 March 1963

Summary: (1) Silver object observed from F-101's at 50,000 feet. Object above at 80 degrees elevation 10 degrees off port. Sighting between Ventura and Santa Barbara. In sight 5-10 minutes. F-101's made turn and lost sight of object. Estimated object to be at 100,000 feet going 500 knots. (2) Bright light resembling star, white with out fear. No control or exhaust. High against clear blue sky. Object 30 degrees above horizon. Disappeared instantaneously to East like lightbulb going out. Reported from Santa Barbara, Vandenburg, Oxnard area. All sightings air visual.

Reference: Col Torgeson, Command Post
Col Gregory, NORAD, 2734/2378

T-33 pilot between Vandenburg and Fresno, California. Vandenburg requested control of F-101's from NORAD. F-101's directed toward UFO. Both aircraft sighted object approaching head on. F-101's made 180 degree turn and lost object. Object estimated to be traveling at 500 knots at 100,000 feet.

Sea Space Systems (code 805-486-8331) Rawinsonde balloon launched at 527 on 6 March to 70,000 feet and burst after one hour at 0637. Wind was from WNW toward Los Angeles, weather was clear.

Pt Mugu Naval Base (area code 805/486-8331) range 7358. Released high-altitude-chaff-drop balloon with metallic parachute on 6 March at 10472. 132 nautical miles SE 230,000 altitude with slight wind carry. Dropped chaff. Lt Apley, Range Officer, Los Angeles Air Defense (NORAD), 28th Air Defense. Time in air 17472 to 18452.

Comments: Pt Mugu made high altitude shot with metallic parachute to 230,000 ft. Parachute with package drifted to SW 132 nautical miles from release point. This object over southern California at the time. Consider motion to West in error and evaluate case as metallic parachute. Information received from Pt Mugu Range Officer, Lt Apley. Los Angeles Air Defense sector had been notified of shot since package contained chaff release. One at 60,000 feet and at 230,000 feet.

Approval numbers 02 [redacted], 78 (Pt Mugu), and 93 (Lt Apley).

The image appears to be a topographical map showing various grid sections (CG, DG, EG, EF, FF, etc.) with numerous elevation markers, geographical features, and what seem to be route or reference numbers (like R-278, R-276, etc.). The map covers an area that includes parts of what looks like Southern California and Nevada, with Las Vegas visible on the right side of the map. The map is detailed with contour lines, elevation numbers, and various markings.
