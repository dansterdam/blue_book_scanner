Dear Sir:

Last March my friend and I saw a flying
saucer over our school it was silver and red at the
time. It had a blue greenish exhaust. It was flying
horizontally for about 5 minutes and then went vertically
up and disappeared. If you it went straight up it
stood in "L" direction. We were told by our school teacher and
a week later told our school teacher and
some friends that we were crazy so we would like to know
how what to do

Thank you

Dear Mr. [redacted]

As your sighting took place about four months ago or longer, it is not possible for this office to provide an evaluation.

The material provided to you some time ago (by this office) clearly defines the Air Force's latest in UFOs and states that there is no evidence that UFOs are an interplanetary spaceship or that they are intelligently controlled vehicles.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
