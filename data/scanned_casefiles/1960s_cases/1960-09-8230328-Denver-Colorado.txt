10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One green-blue object, very bright, that seemed to bounce across the sky, and then stop, then continue moving. This was observed for 3-4 minutes by two witnesses. Object was initially travelling at high speed, slowing somewhat. There was no sound and no vapour trail. The object was heading north and seemed to be at high altitude. Object manoeuvred very sharply, unlike any conventional aircraft. It was no longer visible as it passed out of sight behind some trees.
11. COMMENTS
This sighting was probably of an unconventional aircraft. The object's speed, maneuverability and appearance are not characteristic of a conventional aircraft.
