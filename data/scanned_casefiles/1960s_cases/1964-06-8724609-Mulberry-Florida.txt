Dear Information Officer,

I would like to make a request for a report on any and all incidents of flying objects (H.F.O.) and flying saucers, as well as anything of these connected as I complete the Project Blue Book. I would also like any other information that would be available on this subject.

Now I would like to report a sighting of a mysterious object. It happened one night this past June this year. During the dark and we went to farm to fire a grenade. There at the time at about 7:00 and we were sitting around waiting just off the light by a few miles out of town. During at the time and I lost in looking at the stars and I suddenly it stopped to move. My wife was problem across the sky. It stopped and started again. Then it repeated and grew small and slowly went it disappeared. I would like to know your opinion on this sighting.
