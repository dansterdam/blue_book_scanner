Text extracted from the document:

Dear Information Civilian
I would like to make a suggestions: with various sighting over Mulberry, Florida, during the early evening hours that I have observed, I would like to suggest that you establish a surveillance camera at some strategic location in Mulberry, Florida, where these sightings have been reported.
In my opinion, the sightings are not aircraft of any kind, but some form of unidentified flying object. The size of the object, the manuorering capabilities, and the lack of any sound indicates to me that these are not aircraft. On several occasions I have observed these objects hovering motionless in the sky for periods of 10 to 15 minutes, then suddenly accelerate at tremendous speeds, disappear, and reappear at other locations. This is most unusual for any known aircraft.
I believe that a surveillance camera at a proper location would provide valuable evidence as to the nature of these objects. I would be most happy to assist in any way possible to help establish such a camera and to help monitor the results.
Sincerely
[Signature]
