27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I did definitely see these things and am very curious as to what they could have been. They did not make a sound, were illuminated, perfectly shaped and in a grouping formation - this worse 12 to 20 of them in 2 rows.

The top group containing more than the bottom row. I had just returned home from a class and had looked in the opposite direction upon getting out of my car - (thinking about hearing the possibility of seeing the Apollo 9 during certain hours that night before when returning some from work on the radio).

I saw some stars and they turned in the opposite direction to go in side (around the turning) and then entered it by going home. I thought up helping up a small incline and saw the above mentioned.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT IS CURVED ON ZIG ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

[Handwritten text at bottom of page, partially illegible]:
there were around to be only luminous a little or yellow light apparently. the shape was very clearly shaped in a little way in this stage. very perfectly formed. I guess there might be some form of 20 in a pointing, as in dot size.

FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

14 WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
I had never seen anything like this before. It made me scared and had no idea what I was seeing. Lights as plane usually do. There were quite a lot of them - a real grouping.

15 HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
They passed over my apartment building and then I proceeded to the lobby entrance. I did not go to the other side of the building to view from there - but I couldn't see from here on the building entering the building.

16 DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
As described above.

Here is the text from the document:

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HELP EXPLAIN OR SUGGEST AN ORIGIN, PROPULSION, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

[Hand-drawn sketch of multiple small aircraft-like objects]

No vapor trails
No sound
they appeared almost like little crosses.
Small figures and more than, I have
drawn here. 12-20 figures I would guess.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TREE WHEN NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN COVERED.

Subtends 3° of the stars.

Appears to be a star shaped christmas decoration might resemble what I saw in the sky - a lot of them in two lines in formation. The first row having more in it than the second row.
