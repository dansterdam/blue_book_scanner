1. Reference attached copy of message from Satellite Organ to Satellite, Cheyenne, Massachusetts, dated 12 October 1960. This message is concerning sightings of unidentified objects by [redacted] in New Mexico. The sightings occurred on 12 October 1960 in New Mexico.

2. The AFIC analysis indicates that the objects of this sighting were probably high flying jet aircraft. The angular velocity reported by [redacted] was in a linear velocity and within the capability of jet aircraft and much too slow for meteors.

3. Telephone contact with [redacted] reveals that he believes the objects were high flying jet aircraft. The conversation with [redacted] also brought out the description of lights seen in conjunction with the objects, which also probably jet aircraft.

4. AFIC has not as yet been able to pin down the specific operation to which the aircraft belongs, but when and if this information becomes available, your organization will be advised.
