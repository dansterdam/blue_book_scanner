11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted a blue white colored object that was comparable to a mercury vapor light. It was just like the Echo satellite with the exception that it appears to change direction. When the observers lost sight of the object it was still heading north in an arcing motion rather than the straight line it had previously traveled.

Echo II was over the area traveling toward the north at 23402, which was during the observation period, but this satellite is not visible for 25 minutes. An aircraft could have accounted for the observation.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I FIRST THOUGHT THE OBJECT TO BE ECHO. BUT THE HESITATION IN MOVEMENT, THE STUTTERING OR DIS-ZAGING (WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN OPTICALLY INFLICTED BY MUSCULAR EYES) AND THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND.

THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT MY PROVE IRRELEVANT WAS THE HEAVY AIR TRAFFIC IN THE DIRECTION THE ORBIT TRAVELED FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS AFTER MY SIGHTING. HELPED ME IN MY DECISION TO REJECT THIS OBJECT. APPROX. 25 PLANES BOTH PROP + JET PASSED OVER THE AREA IN THIS TIME.

DEAR SIRS

I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT AN INCIDENT CONCERNING AERIAL PHENOMENA.

ON THE NIGHT OF OCT. 12 1966 I WATCHED A BLUISH WHITE OBJECT CROSS THE SKY. AT FIRST LOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS ECHO WHICH IS OFTEN SIGHTED IN MY AREA. WHEN IT CHANGED DIRECTION I WAS A LITTLE WARY OF MY CONCLUSION THE OBJECT APPEARED FINE AGAINST THE SKY WHICH HAD A SLIGHT OVERCAST. IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR IN THE SKY. IT MOVED IN A EAST TO WEST DIRECTION THEN STOPPED EVER SO SLIGHTLY THEN APPEARED TO MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE. THESE SAME TYPE OR MOVE WENT THAT ONE SEES IF THEY STARE AT SOMETHING TOO LONG. IT THEN PROCEEDED IN A NORTHWESTERLY COURSE. I WAS ON MY WAY TO MY FIANCE'S HOUSE WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THE OBJECT.

WHEN I SAW IT CHANGE DIRECTION I DECIDED TO CALL AHEAD TO SEE IF SHE COULD SPOT ANY THING THEN I HUNG UP SO AS NOT TO GIVE HER ANY REASON TO THINK SHE SAW ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT THERE. AS I WALKED FURTHER TOWARD HER HOUSE I SAW THE THING STOP AGAIN SHUDDER AND TAKE ANOTHER COURSE. THIS TIME IT HEADED NORTH WHEN I LOST SIGHT OF THE THING IT WAS STILL HEADING NORTH IN AN ARCING MOTION RATHER THAN THE STRAIGHT LINE IT HAD PREVIOUSLY TRAVELED. WHEN I GOT TO MY GIRLS HOUSE SHE SAID THAT SHE AND TWO OF HER BROTHERS OBSERVED THE THING ALSO. THEY DESCRIBED THE SAME IDENTICAL MOVEMENTS I OBSERVED.

THE OBJECT WAS IN VIEW THE AFTER PART OF HALF AN HOUR. THE TIME HAS ABOUT SEVEN TWENTY TO GIVEN FORTY FIVE. IT TRAVELED ABOUT 120 DEGREES OF THE SKY USING HORIZON TO HORIZON AS 180 DEGREES. DURING AND AFTER THE OBSERVATION WE SAW AN UNUSUAL ABUNDANCE OF PLANES FLYING IN THE AREA USUALLY TRAVELING TWO AT A TIME IN A CROSSING MANNER. ONE FLYING HIGH THE OTHER LOW CROSSING THE OTHERS PATH.

I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT.

THANK YOU
