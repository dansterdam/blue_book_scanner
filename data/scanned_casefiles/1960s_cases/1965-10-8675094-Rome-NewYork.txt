a. Action taken (agencies called, etc.) FAA and tower checked for known aircraft or radar correlation. A C-130 landed at Griffiss AFB at 0553 EDT. No other reported traffic. No radar returns noted.

b. Final evaluation (accuracy, reliability, timeliness, etc.)
The accuracy of this report is questionable. The person making the report has a record of irresponsible reporting, according to the Griffiss Information Office. He reportedly viewed his call to Griffiss Base Operations around 0500 about sighting and then broadcast this as "news" without further evaluation. He was very vague when asked to clarify. He apparently called the GATE and how he assured himself that this was really an unidentified object, he further stated that he saw a meteor right after seeing the object, and that the object was definitely not a meteor. Checking this object from a meteor scene extremely debatable.
