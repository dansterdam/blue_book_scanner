"MYSTERY LIGHTS"--as mentioned in Las Cruces Sun-News

In case it should be of any interest to anyone, I happened to be photographing a satellite at 12:16 U. T. on January 15. At the conclusion of the transit I happened to look to the north and saw the most brilliant "fireball" I have ever seen. It was a greenish white and seemed to be emitting sparks and was far brighter than any of the planets. I noted the time on our master clock as 12:24 U. T. This meteor (or meteorite) was traveling west to east and faded from sight in (i.e.v) It was going almost on a horizontal path, very slightly slanting downward, and was only about 10 degrees above the horizon when sighted. No red flash as reported by Officer Garcia--also no objects circling in the sky were noted. I don't think we need fear that it was a flying saucer.

Mystery Lights
Seen Flashing
Over Las Cruces
More unidentified flying objects were spotted over Las Cruces early today, making this the third incident in about a year and a half.

Officer Dan Garcia reported he saw a "red flash" travelling in the direction of the Organ Mountains about 5:25 a.m.

He said he later observed a white light stationary in the sky, then "circle around" before disappearing. The police department reported similar sightings were reported further north from here.

The radio at White' Sands Missile Range told the local department that an aircraft over Las Cruces enroute to El Paso "was just missed by a falling star".

Police here said the sightings were to be checked further by the base.
