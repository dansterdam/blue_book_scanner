Dear Sirs:

I am writing in reference to an article that appeared in our St. Louis Post-Dispatch this Thursday, September 28th, in regards to an object seen in the sky by several pilots and persons in town.

As too, have seen an object which seemed to be exactly as was described in the paper, over to Lt's northwest. I noticed this object the first time directly west and to the west of my memory dock for five days later north-northeast. This was the first part of September, the time I was on a weekend furlough. My twelve-year old daughter and I were sitting on the front porch. I watched it very closely with the glasses and fixed it between the trees, hanging. It seems to bounce slightly as it moves and to both focus around to our place. Slow moving, partly seemed to flicker. I was a witness, as is my daughter, who pointed it out to me in the same place. In about two or three minutes, we saw this object. The glitz you wouldn't notice it moving. The second time I saw it was a little while later. While first it was about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon, this time it was a little higher. I could see a glass canister and a miniature white light. We all took time with the glasses and were too far away to see more details.

also had our view. On both occasions we called
our UFO "hover" which is the west so I was
then. I've called the would not so information.
I also called the weather bureau and they told
me it was probably Venus. I had never seen
Venus to three definite colors before I'd we
had that been to New Zealand information in
New York several weeks before.

The children and I would certainly enjoy a
reply soon you if you find it in your
interest.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

This will acknowledge your letter of 30 September to the North American Air Defense Command concerning the two sightings by you of an unidentified flying object.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, ask that you complete an Air Force questionnaire on each of the sightings, and that your son and daughter also complete one. The completed documents should be sent to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
