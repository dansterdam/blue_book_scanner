MARCH 18, 1955

REPORT ON SIGHTING OF OBJECTS OBSERVED

DEAR SIR:

I AM WRITING IN REFERENCE TO AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED IN THE ST. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRAT, GAS-CONTAINING, THIS DATE, REGARDING AN OBSERVATION I MADE DURING THE EVENING OF MARCH 8, 1955 IN THE ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI AREA.

I WAS REVIEW AN OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE A LARGE DISC, HOVERING ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND SOME 200 YARDS FROM OUR HOME. THE OBJECT WAS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. I DISCUSSED THIS OBSERVATION WITH MY WIFE AND SEVERAL OF OUR NEIGHBORS, ALL OF WHOM SAW THE OBJECT.

I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER AND MY WIFE IS A REGISTERED NURSE. ALTHOUGH I HAVE GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT WHAT WE SAW COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF AIRCRAFT, I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NEITHER A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT NOR A WEATHER BALLOON. THE OBJECT WAS SILENT, DID NOT HAVE ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, HOVERING ABOVE THE GROUND. ALSO, IT DID NOT CONFORM TO THE USUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EITHER AIRCRAFT OR BALLOONS.

I WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN HAVING SOMEONE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER FURTHER. IF YOU DESIRE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

VERY TRULY YOURS,
[SIGNATURE REDACTED]

Text from the document:
The following was hand copied from a document whose entire contents were hand written and is believed to be a verbatim transcript. The handwriting appears to be that of a scientific observer, who appears to have been in the process of recording observations or information received from another source. The handwriting style and wording suggests a document that would have been produced in the 1950s or early 1960s, perhaps as part of the Project Blue Book investigations into unidentified flying objects.
"The witnesses stated that they were driving on the highway at around 9:00 PM when they saw a bright object hovering at approximately 1000 feet altitude. The object remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly shot off at a high rate of speed to the West, disappearing from view within a few seconds. The witnesses believe that the object they saw was some type of unconventional aerial vehicle, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, but they were unable to determine its exact nature or purpose."

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed letter from the North American Air Defense Command acknowledging the receipt of a letter from Mrs. P. and providing a response.

OCR output:

14 October 1960

Dear Mrs. P.,

This will acknowledge your letter of 30 September to the North American Air Defense Command concerning the unidentified flying objects.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, with the information available, this command is unable to analyze the data or draw any conclusions. The complete documents should be submitted for their analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt Colonel, USAF
