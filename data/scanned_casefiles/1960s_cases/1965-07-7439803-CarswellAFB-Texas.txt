ATTN OF: BGCE/SSgt Nixon                                     30 July 1965

SUBJECT: Report of Unknown Flying Object

TO:    Hq USAF

THRU:  Hq 7th Bomb Wing (DOOI)

1. An Unknown Flying Object was observed by at least five people
at Carswell AFB, Texas on 29 July 1965 at 2040 hours CST.

2. The UFO flew directly through the Carswell AFB Control Zone
at a low altitude without position lights showing.

3. The UFO was observed to have at least three brilliant
pulsating white lights observable from head-on or astern.

4. The UFO was observed to fly at a constant rate and a constant
altitude without evidence of conventional means of propulsion. It
was completely silent in flight.

5. The attached statement can be substantiated and corroborated.

6. My qualifications and credentials are as follows:
   a. I am a Command Pilot
   b. I am a Major, USAF
   c. I have a Top Secret Clearance

7. This sighting was a positive observation, under ideal
circumstances, of a definite object of an unconventional nature-
possibly of foreign origin, which could be a threat to national
security.

8. A definite need appears to exist for a procedure which will
insure positive identification by interceptor aircraft in situations
of this kind.

STATEMENT

On 29 July 1965 at 2040 hours CST, my wife and I were bicycling on the north perimeter of Carswell AFB, Texas, when my wife called my attention to two lights approaching from the south. We stopped riding and watched. The lights were brilliant white, pulsating on and off simultaneously approximately once every second. They appeared to be fixed to, or part of, a single object moving toward us in level flight or a very slight descent. They were showing no conventional position lights.

The object moved at a constant speed, altitude, and direction on a flight path that was almost directly over us. As it passed overhead the lights disappeared from view except for an erratic sparkling on the leading edge. The object moved away at a constant speed on the same course at approximately 250 degrees. As it moved away a single pulsating light became visible. This light was a bit more intense than the lights seen from the front view, and it pulsed somewhat slower, as though from Doppler Effect.

At no time was there any sound-not even the sound a gliding object would make normally. The only audible sound in the area at the time was a distant radio playing.

Judging from the low approach angle (approximately 20 degrees above the horizon when first seen) and the low departure angle (less than 20 degrees when only a short distance away), I would estimate the object was below 1000 feet altitude. Based on this altitude, I would estimate the object's speed at 50 to 60 knots.

At the time of the incident, there was a C-124 aircraft being loaded or unloaded on. the compass rose a few hundred yards south of our position. There were Air Police guards and trucks around the aircraft.

Upon returning to my quarters, I called the control tower. The sighting was verified by three other persons on duty, including Sgt and Sgt.

THIS STATEMENT IS TRUE AND CORRECT.

MENT OF [REDACTED] CONCERNING UFO: "ON 29 JULY
1965 AT 20:0 HRS CST, MY WIFE AND I WERE BICYCLING ON THE NORTH PERI-
METER OF CARSWELL AFB, TEXAS, WHEN MY WIFE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO TWO
LIGHTS APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH. WE STOPPED RIDING AND WATCHED.
THE LIGHTS WERE BRILLIANT WHITE, PULSATING ON AND OFF SIMULTANEOUSLY
APPROXIMATELY ONCE EVERY SECOND. THEY APPEARED TO BE FIXED TO, OR
PART OF, A SINGLE OBJECT MOVING TOWARD US IN LEVEL FLIGHT OR A VERY
SLIGHT DESCENT. THEY WERE SHOWING NO CONVENTIONAL POSITION LIGHTS.

FLIGHT PATH THAT WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER US. AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD
THE LIGHTS DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW EXCEPT FOR AN ERRATIC SPARKLING ON
THE LEADING EDGE. THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A CONSTANT SPEED ON THE
SAME COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 360 DEGREES. AS IT MOVED AWAY A SINGLE
PULSATING LIGHT BECAME VISIBLE. THIS LIGHT WAS A BIT MORE INTENSE
THAN THE LIGHTS SEEN FROM THE FRONT VIEW, AND IT PULSED SOMEWHAT
SLOWER, AS THOUGH FROM DOPPLER EFFECT.

AT NO TIME WAS THERE ANY SOUND, NOT EVEN THE SOUND A GLIDING OB-
JECT WOULD MAKE NORMALLY. THE ONLY AUDIBLE SOUND IN THE AREA AT THE
TIME WAS A DISTANT RADIO PLAYING.

JUDGING FROM THE LOW APPROACH ANGLE (APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES ABOVE
THE HORIZON WHEN FIRST SEEN) AND THE LOW DEPARTURE ANGLE (LESS THAN
20 DEGREES WHEN ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY), I WOULD ESTIMATE THE
OBJECT WAS BELOW 1000 FEET ALTITUDE. BASED ON THIS ALTITUDE, I WOULD
ESTIMATE THE OBJECT'S SPEED AT 50 TO 60 KNOTS.

AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THERE WAS A C-124 AIRCRAFT BEING
LOADED OR UNLOADED ON THE COMPASS ROSE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS SOUTH OF
OUR POSITION. THERE WERE AIR POLICE GUARDS AND TRUCKS AROUND THE
AIRCRAFT.
