REPLY TO
ATTN OF: RDSCP/Sgt Nimon

SUBJECT: Report of Unknown Flying Object

TO: HQ USAF

THRU: M 7th Bomb Wing (DOOR)

1. An Unknown Flying Object was observed by at least five people at Carswell AFB, Texas on 29 July 1965 at 2030 hours CST. 
2. The UFO flew directly through the CARWELL AFB Control Zone at a low altitude without position lights showing.
3. The UFO was observed to have at least three brilliant flashing white lights observable from outside or astern.
4. The UFO was observed to fly at a constant rate and a constant altitude without evidence of conventional means of propulsion. It was completely silent in flight.
5. The attached statement can be substantiated and corroborated.
6. My qualifications and conclusions are as follows:
a. I am a Command Pilot
b. I am a Major, USAFR
c. I have a Top Secret Clearance

7. This sighting was a positive observation, under ideal circumstances, of a definite object of an unconventional nature, possibly of foreign origin, which could be a threat to national security.

8. It appears to merit consideration for a procedure which will assure positive identification by interceptor aircraft in situations of this kind.

STATEMENT

On 29 July 1965 at 2030 hours CST, my wife and I were bicycling on the north perimeter of Carswell AFB, Texas, when my wife called my attention to two bright, pulsating lights which she spotted coming from the south. We observed these bright lights pulsating on and off as they approached directly overhead at a constant speed, altitude, and direction. 

The object moved at a constant speed, altitude, and direction over the area for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. At first, the object appeared to be two separate objects, but as it moved closer, it became one large object. This large object was about the size of a baseball bat, speaking on the leading edge. The object moved away at a constant rate towards the east and seemed to increase in altitude. At this point it became difficult to see, and it pulsed away a single pulsating light until it became invisible. 

At no time was there any sound--not even the sound a gliding plane could make under normal circumstances. The only audible sound in the area at the time was a distant radio playing.

Estimating the object's size from our distance was difficult, but we would estimate the object's speed at 50 to 60 knots. If the object was a C-141 aircraft being loaded or unloaded on the compass rose a few hundred yards south of our position, there would be no doubt in my mind, but the object was quite strange and baffling.  

Upon returning to my quarters, I called the control tower. The sighting was verified by three other persons on duty, including the Sgt.

THIS STATEMENT IS TRUE AND CORRECT.

FLIGHT PATH THAT WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER US, AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD THE LIGHTS DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW EXCEPT FOR AN ERRATIC SPARKLING ON THE LEADING EDGE. THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A CONSTANT SPEED ON THE SAME COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 360 DEGREES. AS IT MOVED AWAY A SINGLE PULSATING LIGHT BECAME VISIBLE. THIS LIGHT WAS A BIT MORE INTENSE THAN THE LIGHTS SEEN FROM THE FRONT VIEW, AND IT PULSED SOMEWHAT SLOWER, AS THOUGH FROM DOPPLER EFFECT.

AT NO TIME WAS THERE ANY SOUND, NOT EVEN THE SOUND A GLIDING OB-JECT WOULD MAKE NORMALLY. THE ONLY AUDIBLE SOUND IN THE AREA AT THE TIME WAS A DISTANT RADIO PLAYING.

JUDGING FROM THE LOW APPROACH ANGLE (APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON WHEN FIRST SEEN) AND THE LOW DEPARTURE ANGLE (LESS THAN 20 DEGREES WHEN ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY), I WOULD ESTIMATE THE OBJECT WAS BELOW 1000 FEET ALTITUDE. BASED ON THIS ALTITUDE, I WOULD ESTIMATE THE OBJECT'S SPEED AT 30 TO 60 KNOTS.

AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THERE WAS A C-124 AIRCRAFT BEING LOADED OR UNLOADED ON THE COMPASS ROSE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS SOUTH OF OUR POSITION. THERE WERE AIR POLICE GUARDS AND TRUCKS AROUND THE AIRCRAFT.
