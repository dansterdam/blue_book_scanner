Second UFO Sighted Here In Two Weeks

At least two persons saw what they reported to be a mysterious object hovering over Grafton for more than an hour night before last.

Cecil Devers, 315 West Washington Street, sighted the unidentified object (UFO) at 10:15 p.m. moving toward the old city park.

According to Devers, the object was disc-shaped and was bright silver in color.

When asked what he thought of the sighting, he said, "Well, if you ask me, there's something going on up there that we don't know about. It's all a mystery, but I know I saw something."

Mrs. Everett Scotta, 210 West Washington Street, reported that she, too, had spotted the object.

Mrs. Scotta gave the following account of what she heard and saw:

"My husband is ill, and I had gone downstairs to check and see if he needed anything, when I heard an unfamiliar buzzing noise. After seeing that he was all right, I went out on the porch."

When out on the porch, so I went to check if I had any electrical appliances turned on. I hadn't, so I went back out on the porch, and then is when I saw the object."

"It was headed toward Maple Avenue, and was making a Beep, Beep noise. It was bright silver, and was disc-shaped. Red and other lights were flashing."

"It seemed to go toward the old pottery, and then disappeared. I must have watched it for over an hour and a half before it disappeared."

Mrs. Scotta was asked whether or not she had seen the object through binoculars, and she replied, "It would be hard to tell without binoculars. It was something moving around the sides. It could have been windows."

She was asked whether or not the object frightened her, and she said, "No, but there was something there. I'm not brave per-son, but let me tell you, when you see something like this it just sends cold chills up your spine."

Many sightings have been reported in the Grafton area during the past months, but no one seems to have any answers to the aerial phenomena, or now they came to being.

Area authorities were contacted about the object, but referred to the fact that they had not been called to investigate any such incidents, except for the sighting at the Orbe Corporation plant two weeks ago.

No one seemed able to travel toward Blueville, finally disappearing in the Haynond Section.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                8 Aug 63
Subj: UFO Sightings, 7 Aug 63, Gamma, by Dr Hynek

Dr J Allen Hynek calledthe Aerial Phenomena Office on 7 Aug 63 at 1300 hours, EDT, to inform us that he saw a funny thing. Saw a jet chasing something at 11pm due North, a very bright ball of light, brighter than Venus. 10 deg behind the unknown object was a jet.

"We don't think we could here any sound from the bright object but we did here noise fromm the jet." Could see the wing tip lights from the jet but only one big light from the object. Plane probably from Kincheloe, so Dr Hynek thought. Dr Hynek said he saw the object for presumably two minutes, but it may have been three. Dr Hynek said he was going to call Kincheloe and ask for information and would appreciate our office doing so. Dr Hynek will call tomorrow morning.

At 1400 hours got through to Lt Col Quintanilla who was TDY in Wash, D.C. We will not contact Kincheloe to obtain the data. Additional information to obtain from Dr Hynek is: Arc of sky covered. Did it pass directly overhead? Did Dr Hynek get any photographs? He always carries a camera. What was Dr Hynek's estimation of the weather? Was it clear, cloud, etc?

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir,

Approximately 2025Q on 10 Aug 68 I saw a phenomenon in late sky I feel I should report to you. When I went out of my house I saw a narrow, bluish-green band of light to the WNW that I at first thought was the aurora borealis—I really it is a northern latitude specially. It was from the horizon over Pic del Este Mt. to a point 60° above and over my JG quarters at the U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Rds. PR. I then noticed a bright, yellow-white light, with an elliptical halo, around it, slightly above the mountain and in the band of bluish-green light.

I called to my wife, as I thought maybe I was seeing my first flying saucer, and when I did so I took my eyes off the object, and lost it. She noticed a white light which appeared

[Note: The last line appears to be cut off at the bottom of the page]


- page 8 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

It will be the size of a faint magnitude star moving
in the band of light.

It was then I realized that it was probably
a satellite and that the band of light was
more than likely reflected light from the sun which
had set an hour or so earlier.

When the white light reached directly overhead
it disappeared. There were no clouds. The band
of light ran from 20-30° of arc in front to the
point distance behind and moved through the sky
with the white light, "the tail" disappearing also
at the overhead point. The white light transited
the sky at about the same rate that I observed
an Echo satellite pass years ago in the Pacific.

I have ten years flying experience,
both in jets and props.

Enclosed clipping could be related.

Here is the text from the document:

Could you tell me if a satellite transited WNW to ESE over this area on the night in question? Also, what period this band of light? Is this unusual?

Sincerely,

THE SAN JUAN STAR - Tuesday, August 13, 1968.

V.I. Gets $350,000 For Teacher's Housing
S T. T H O M A S (AP) - Governor Ralph Falenwebly has received a check for more than $260,000 as a loan from the Chase Manhattan Bank for the construction of "urgently needed" housing for teachers in the Virgin Islands.

The housing units are to be used by teachers recruited on the mainland to work in the Virgin Islands public school system.

The shortage of moderate priced apartments has often been cited by teachers as the reason why they hesitate to come to the Virgin Islands in the first place and tend to leave after one year of teaching.

Present at Government House for the ceremony were assistant commissioner of education Charles Trumbull, budget director Magdalene Bryan, commissioners of finance Robert Wheatley, and Chase Manhattan Bank Manager John W. Gate.

NEW PARTY
(Continued From Page 15)
the Republican Party for a future try at the party's Presidential nomination.

Other names mentioned are Senator McGovern and Governor Rockefeller, but both men are considered unlikely to accept a fourth party ticket.

It is recognized political figure Raskin said, "I would nominate a well-known but essentially political figure active in the antinew movement. A list of possibilities is now being drafted, he said.

Dorvillier To Address
San Juan Lions Club
William J. Dorvillier, former editor of the San Juan STAR, will speak to the San Juan Lions Club at their Wednesday meeting meeting at the Caribe Hilton. His topic will be "An analysis of the political situation in Puerto Rico."

Mystery Object Hovers
Over Yauco Mountains
YAUCO (AP) - Two policemen reported Monday that they saw a bright object hovering over a mountain near here and that, after a while, the object sped away over the ocean.

Local police officials, however, admitted they were not quite sure how to start investigating the report.

Sentimental

On Aug 13, 1968 at 7:45 pm and my brother (Todd
Allen) and myself) observed an object (perhaps a
UFO) traveling east. The description of this object
is as follows: A color-brilliant silver
        B. Shape-Oval
        C. Sound-none
        After observing it for one minute we discovered
that our UFO was really a jet plane reflecting the sun
rays. We think this may be of some help in explaining
other UFO sightings. Also Iq ask you to send me
information on UFOs. Thank you.

1. Reference your undated letter reporting a sighting of a satellite for 19 Aug 69. If the object you saw was first seen at an azimuth of 130° and disappeared at an azimuth of 310°, then it may have been one of the visible retro-grade satellites. However, because there are approximately a total of 33 retro-grade satellites and not all are visible to the naked eye, an exact identification would be extremely difficult.

2. The governing regulation for Project Blue Book is AFR 80-17. This regulation allows for investigation of UFO reports originating within the continental United States. Therefore, we are unable to further investigate your sighting. However, we will include your report for information purposes with our permanent files.

Dear Sirs:

On the evening of 17 August 1967 at 1125 GMT in Rd 4 Ft. Rucker, Redding, while on war an a blk turning, approx. from the direction of 150° for 310° it site was a small white light of an object moving from horizon to horizon.

I assume that the object was until the last moment appreciably any formation you would receive some info giving me to pursue further.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES: AUG. 12-18, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to Environmental Science Administration, Public Inquiries Section, au 163, Washington, Maryland 20232. Bulk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.50 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents shown as dashed lines, and are labeled at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The traces of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally, apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from these station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart shows contours of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete data are indicated by "tr", which indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
