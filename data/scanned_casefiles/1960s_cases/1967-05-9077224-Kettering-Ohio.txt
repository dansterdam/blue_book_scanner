Text transcribed from the document:

At about 9:30 p.m. on April 7, 1967 I was looking towards the southwestern horizon on Glengarry St. At the time my attention was drawn to a bright light moving in an easterly direction at a fairly low altitude. It appeared to be fairly close and as I watched it I observed the light to be flashing on and off at irregular intervals. The object then appeared to hover for a short time and then resumed its eastward movement and was then lost from sight. The object appeared to be oval or circular in shape and emitted a very bright white light. I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter. The duration of the sighting was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The night was clear and there was no cloud cover. No aircraft or other objects were observed in the area at the time.
