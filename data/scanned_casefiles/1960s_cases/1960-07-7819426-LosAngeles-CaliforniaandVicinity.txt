11. COMMENTS
It has been determined from interviews
and description and duration that the
object of this sighting was a meteor.
On occasion the appearance of rising
is present and as the distance from
the observer increases the object then
has the appearance of descent. Also
evaluated meteor by astronomers at
Griffith Observatory.
