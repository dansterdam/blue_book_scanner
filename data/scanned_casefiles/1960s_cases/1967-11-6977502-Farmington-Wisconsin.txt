10. CONCLUSION
Probable Astro (VENUS)
The local Air Base was called during sighting. Nothing unusual. Two airmen went outside to try to observer the object.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Civilian observers sighted a round red-orange object that was approx 20 yds in diameter. Inside lights were observed. The object moved in a Easterly direction and back to the original position then disappeared rapidly over the horizon to the west.

COMMENTS CONT'D: They noticed an object in the general direction of the initial sighting. They said it appeared bigger than a and silver in color. Shaped and diameter were not known due to the distance of the object. Twenty minutes later the object had disappeared. VENUS was setting in the Western sky at approx 2050 hrs. VENUS with a stellar mag. at this time of year, or ~3.4, would have been the brightest astronomical body in the western sky.

Proposed reply to letter from                29 March 1967

Dear

Reference your recent letter concerning an alleged observation of an unidentified flying saucer over the Farmington, Wisconsin area on 21 March 1967. A detailed investigation lead to the conclusion that the planet, Venus, was probably responsible for the sighting.

Venus was setting in the western sky at approximately 2050 hours. Venus with a stellar magnitude, at this time of the year, of -3.4, would have been the brightest astronomical body in the western sky.

The report from Osceola AFS reported no unusual sightings observed on radar. In addition, personnel at Osceola reported observing a star like object quite bright in the western sky. The description submitted by the civilian observers and the military personnel are very consistent with that of an astronomical observation, with Venus being responsible for the sighting. During this time of the year Venus has been responsible for numerous alleged UFO observations.

Secretary of the Air Force
(SAF-CI)
Bolling Air Force Base,
Washington, D.C. 20332

Dear Sir,

We wonder if you could give us any confirmation or information on a report on an unidentified flying object sighted near the Osceola Air Force Base, at Farmington, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, March 21, again on the 22nd.

Officials at the Osceola base tell us that they are not in a position to confirm whether or not this object was tracked on their radar screens (this is a radar action).

The object, which was said to be saucer-shaped, with a steadily glowing orange light, on its dome, moved, darted and hovered about low in the sky, within a half-mile of four observers. Two young boys first sighted it and called another man and woman to watch. They observed it for about 15 minutes before it darted very swiftly off to the west. The object appeared again the following night when the boys were alone, and they snapped a picture of it as it flew overhead, but since they just got their film in for processing, we don't know yet if anything could have turned out.

They also reported that their radio stopped dead suddenly, and that their dog ran off howling into the barn. This incident occurred on a farm within three miles of the Osceola Air Force Station, the Farmington, Wisconsin.

When these people spotted the object and phoned the Air Force base, the men who answered told them that by standing outside the door, they could see the orange light over the farm.

Could you possibly make any comment for the newspaper about this report? Would you be able to tell us if the object was tracked on the radar screens?

Thank you for any information you can give us,

Sincerely,
(Mrs)
