RESULTED IN NEGATIVE REPORT OF AIRCRAFT IN GENERAL VICINITY
AT TIME OF SIGHTING. ITEM KILO: OFFICER PREPARING REPORT:
CAPTAIN JOHNNY M. SHANKS, AO 550655, CHIEF OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
315TH AIR DIVISION, APO 259. POSSIBLE EXPLANATION: BECAUSE
OF DEFINITE OPINION OF OBSERVERS THAT THIS WAS NOT A BALLOON
AT THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEASE AND SIGHTING, THERE
IS NO EVALUATED ANALYSIS OF THIS SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THESE
OFFICERS DID REPORT THIS IMMEDIATELY TO ADCC, NAHA AND
APPEARED TO BE MATURE, INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALS, (ESPECIALLY
IN THEIR PRESENTATION OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS). AT NO TIME DID
THEY HESITATE IN THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE UFO AND WERE
POSITIVE OF ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GAVE. SINCE ALL
THREE OFFICERS HAVE WITNESSED THE FLIGHT PATH OF SATELLITES
IT IS OFFERED THAT PERHAPS THIS UFO COULD HAVE BEEN THE PATH
OF A MISSILE, WHOSE FIRING DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THIS
OFFICE. THE OBSERVERS STATED THAT THE SPEED OF THIS UFO COULD
HAVE BEEN IN THE SUPERSONIC RANGE BUT OWING TO DARKNESS AND
LACK OF HORIZON-REFERENCE, THEY COULD NOT DEFINITELY ESTIMATE
THE SPEED.
