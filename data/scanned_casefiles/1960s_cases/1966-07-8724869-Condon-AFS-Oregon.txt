NO.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes (No) Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

It would fill only one centimeter, while one arm length could completely enclose it, it was so small.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

No drawing provided.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, that contains instructions and diagrams for a questionnaire or survey related to UFO sightings.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

2/22/66 Capt. Gallagher - Chief Investigator, Offutt AFB

- page 11 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn diagram or sketch. The diagram appears to depict the observed movement of a UFO, with arrows indicating the object's trajectory and changes in direction.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 June 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the investigation:
When first sighted, the object appeared in front and to the left up in the sky. It did not appear to be very high, but it seemed to be moving rapidly to the right. After it had moved a little to the right, it suddenly turned to the left at the intersection and it appeared only a little that came appeared as far as to move much like a star. It continued a little to the left and ahead of me for approx 5 miles, the distance from me stayed constant. After I went in to call home, when I came back out, the object was gone. The action was similar to the moving at first more to the left.
