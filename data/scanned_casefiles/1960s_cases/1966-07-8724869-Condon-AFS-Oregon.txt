35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

When first sighted, the object appeared in front and to the left up in the sky. Did not appear to be very high, but I am unable to estimate the height or distance from me. I turned to the right at the intersection and it appeared on my left but seemed to be further off and did not look so much like a star. Just a distant light that kept moving.

It continued a little to the left and ahead of me for approx 5 miles, the distance from cut-off to where I turn to go home. After I made the turn to go home, I stopped the car and got out to look. The light was still moving away but more to the left.

The document also contains a hand-drawn diagram showing the movement path of the observed object, with various arrows indicating its trajectory.
