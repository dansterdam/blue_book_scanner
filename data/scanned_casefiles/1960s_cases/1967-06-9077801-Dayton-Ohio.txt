OCR Output:
34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 - 2 - 66 
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
There are several odd things about the sighting that are not covered. First, the object moved along the horizon for several miles at a constant velocity, and later accelerated rapidly to the north and out of sight. This was not a normal aircraft or helicopter. Secondly, the object had a unique configuration that I have never seen on any conventional aircraft - it was oblong shaped, with a dark color and had no visible wings, tail, or other protruding parts. There were also no navigation lights visible, which would be highly unusual for an aircraft. I do not believe this was any type of man-made vehicle. The object was observed by both my wife and myself, and we are both certain it was not a normal aircraft or astronomical phenomenon. Please let me know if you require any additional details about this sighting.
6/23/66 - Woke up about 11:20 p.m.
DAY-ESTATE - Some strange noises outside - went to window - saw strange oblong object moving silently across the sky from northwest to southeast - about 800-1000 feet altitude - no lights on but object was clearly visible - seemed to be moving at great speed - about the size of a Piper Cub - watched it for 30-45 seconds until it disappeared to the southeast - went back to bed - slept soundly until morning.

In the text output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes a diagram and instructions for the viewer. The diagram shows a curved line with angle measurements and a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a point on the curved line and draw how high the object was above the horizon, as well as indicate on the compass where the object was last seen.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
