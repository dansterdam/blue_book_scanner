1. Reference the cinder like material submitted to the Aerial
Phenomena Branch for analysis. The material was analyzed by the
Air Force Materials Laboratory at Wright-Patterson and found to
contain the following nominal chemical composition:

Si                1.2 %
Fe                0.5
Ca                0.5
Al                0.2
Mg                0.2
Na                0.04
Tl                0.04
Pb                0.002
Cr                0.002
Mn                0.002
B                 0.002
Carbon            Balance

2. The material was identified as coke. There is no evidence that
the specimen originated from extraterrestrial sources.
