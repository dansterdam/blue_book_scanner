UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Tel Aviv, Israel
Date: 2 July 60
Witness: Not reported
Description: A bright light that seemed to glow and grow larger, 205 deg at 10 deg elev, there was no apparent motion.
Direction of Motion: Stationary
Satellite: (AFCIN-4E23, Phone 69219) - Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Meteor ruled out
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): _______
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: _______ 
Other: Insufficient data
Evaluation of Source Reliability: _______ 
Analysis and Conclusions: If the elevation reported by the witness is about 30 deg, the object could have been the star Spica, but the time witness was that it was stationary, and a weather balloon could not have remained stationary for the duration reported. Thus, a valid conclusion cannot be made.
