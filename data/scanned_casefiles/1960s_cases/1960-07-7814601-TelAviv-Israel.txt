UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Tel Aviv, Israel

Date 2 July 60                   Hour (2)   1825Z

WX Not reported

Description 4 bright light that seemed to glow and grow larger, seen
205 deg at 10 deg elev. there was no apparent motion

Direction of Motion Stationary

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Meter ruled out, poss
star Since if reported elevation is wrong

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1)        None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc)  --------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Not ruled out, possibly a weather
balloon

Other Insufficient data

Evaluation of Source Reliability   Poss reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: If the elevation reported by the witness was off
by about 30 deg, the object could have been the star Spica. It is doubtful
that the witness was that far off on its estimation, however. The sun had just
set a few minutes prior to the sighting, and a weather balloon would appear
to glow as it ascended into the sunlit. However, the object was reported to
be stationary, and the duration was not reported to allow a determination
it was a balloon, nothing a short time. Due to the duration of the sighting
not being reported, a valid conclusion cannot be made.
