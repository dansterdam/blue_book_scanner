10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two objs with normal paint on height finder of size about 1/4 that of a/c observed for almost 1/2 hrs. Objs were 2 miles apart. Initial pickup on HRI at 80,000 ft 112 deg azimuth 69 miles range, disappearance at 106 deg azimuth 74 miles range. Height fluctuated between 60,000 to 80,000 ft in vertical movement. Normal AP-F-33 airborne could not get visual contact. 2 flights were scrambled for identification and could get Radar pickup but no visual contact. Three flights and 6 a/c scrambled in attempt to gain visual contact without success.

11. COMMENTS
Negatives of scope forwarded. Analysis submitted to Electronics branch for evaluation. Balloon with radar corner reflector considered as the most probable cause. Transparent balloon would be difficult to see from a/c traveling at high speed. It would be picked up on air intercept Radar. (See analysis)

12. CONCLUSIONS
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon

[The rest of the text is partially legible, with some words and phrases discernible, but many parts are difficult to read clearly. The document appears to be a handwritten report with numbered paragraphs. The text seems to discuss some kind of activity or observation, but without a complete clear reading, I cannot confidently reproduce the full text.]


- page 4 -

The only legible text on this page is at the top left, which appears to read:

"1127.5 (UNK)"

The image contains a black and white photograph showing what seems to be a bright, elongated streak or trail against a dark background, possibly a photograph of an unidentified flying object or meteor.


- page 5 -

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

12:17.5 - 8 - 63

The rest of the text is illegible due to the low quality of the scanned image. The image appears to be a black and white photograph with a white vertical line and some white shapes or objects on a dark background, but the details are difficult to make out clearly.

The text I can discern on this page is:

1367.6 at 65

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing what seems to be an unidentified flying object or unusual aerial phenomenon. The image is grainy and shows a white/bright object with a distinct shape against a dark background, with some diagonal lines or edges.

The rest of the document appears to be a black and white photographic image with grainy, high-contrast qualities showing what seems to be an object or shape against a dark background. The image contains two similar white/light-colored T-shaped or hook-like forms, one in the main image and a smaller one in an inset image in the top right corner.


- page 9 -

The text I can discern on this page is very limited:

At the top left corner, there appears to be some faint text that looks like "137 5 6(1)"

In the top right corner, there is a number "6"

The rest of the page appears to be a black and white photographic image with a white elongated object or trail against a dark background. The image is grainy and low contrast, typical of older photographic documents.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Melville AS (NTL)
18276 5 Aug 63

The number "5" is also visible in the top right corner of the document. The rest of the image appears to be a black and white photograph with varying shades of gray and white, showing what seems to be an angular or geometric shape against a dark background.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEED
SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFO Report from Melville AS, Labrador

TO: TDEW (Capt Quintanilla)

1. Since visual contact of the target was not made in this case, it is impossible to state with certainty what caused the returns on the radars.

2. Equipment malfunction can be ruled out, since several radars displayed the same target; and anomalous propagation appears to be unlikely.

3. From the activity of the target it appears that the most logical explanation is a balloon, possibly carrying a radar corner reflector. This would not necessarily be a balloon released by people, or even by one of the western countries. Balloons have been known to travel hundreds of miles, and the relatively small lateral travel, coupled with the variation in altitude from 6,000 ft to 8,000 ft, would be typical of a balloon. If the balloon were small and silver or transparent, it might well be next to impossible to see visually, yet would be easily detected by the radars.
