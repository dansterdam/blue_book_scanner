Subject: Case file under 4 July 1965

TDEW
UFO Sighting, Pike County, Missouri

Hq USAF SAFOIC (Mrs Hunt)
Webb D C 20339

1. Reference the attached unidentified object report from
the sighting of objects on the night of
26 July and 4 September 1965 are similar to many reports in
our files of helicopter observations. The slow flight, including
portions of hovering, the whoosh sound and the apparent erratic
fluctuation of the red light are characteristic of these reports.
The intensity as well as deviation in appearance at a regular
interval is caused when the aircraft is in a turn or at an angle
when the light shines through the "bubble" or open portion of
the craft. It's quite likely that Navy and/or other military, which
is located on aviation section charts, is used as a reference
point in cross country flights.

2. We had no unusual reports from Pike County, Missouri during
this period. The ADC reported no unidentified tracks from her
area. Helicopters on flights of this nature could be flown by
the Air National Guard, Navy, Army and/or other military units
within a radius of 150 miles. In view of the reported character-
istics and delay of the submission of report no attempt will
be made to identify a specific flight.
