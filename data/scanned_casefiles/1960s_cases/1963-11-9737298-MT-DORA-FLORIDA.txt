AFB STATED THAT WITH THE DOUBLE INVERSION BALLOONS RELEASED FROM NEAR BY STATIONS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE PRODUCED MULTIPLE ILLUSIONS BUT THAT CONSIDERING WINDS AND THE FACT OF TWO DIFFERENT SIGHTINGS, THIS WOULD NOT BE LIKELY. THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT FROM MCCOY OR SANFORD NAVAL AIR STATION IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS DETECTED BY AC&W OR APPROACH CONTROLS AT THE TIME OF SIGHTINGS. OBSERVER IN QUESTIONING SEEMED RELIABLE
