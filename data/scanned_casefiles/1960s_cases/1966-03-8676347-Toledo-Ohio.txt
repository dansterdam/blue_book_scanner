I was walking to the store when I looked up and saw a black - white object in the sky. So I watched it as I walked to the store and it just hovered. I observed it from 104th and Summit to 116th and Summit Street.

The postal address became clearly visible on Summit Street, because I was on the corner of 104th and Summit Street.

The one about the star brightness over it near a star on any night or a star that might. Because if it were on a night of observers the answer would have been no because the clouds covered it star.

Sincerely Yours,

P.S. I would like additional facts about UFO's and any other come if possible.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

To begin there on the evening of March 28, 1966 while changing my clothes/out not pajamas, and being bare - I just heard a terrible pointing at my front door. Some look my good old time in seeing who was at my door. Some women had asked me to come out, and look into the sky. So I finally went out, and looked. Standing on my steps without shoes I looked, and there was a large reddish object with hundreds of points walking somewhat. Then it seemed to go above while crossing the walkway. Then a shooting star like walking sometimes. The point seemed to disappear. Then a shooting star fell. I did run out the house to get a coat and a pair of binoculars. Then an airplane was chasing this object, this in when the sidelic orange color had changed to a bright white light as if the flood light which is used on television for the stars. When first seeing this object it seemed as if someone could have reached it. Somehow I had never seen so many stars in the sky before. I was not frightened only busy as I had never seen such things before. It all seemed very unreal. I do hope that some day these can all be explained. To one can believe this unless they get the opportunity to see such a first such as this. I am just pile every day, and have never seen anything like this in my life. There is one thing which I have not seen since this happened as these are not as many stars in the sky.

This is the way the object appeared to me on the evening of March 28, 1966. With only using a naked eye. Only there were hundreds of points I can not draw't. Page 8

Many, Many Stars also.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of a circular object with jagged, spiky edges, surrounded by small star-like marks. The drawing seems to be an attempt to depict an unidentified flying object (UFO) as seen by the observer.

To Whom It May Concern:

On the evening of March 28, 1966 Between the hours of 8:00 and 9:00 P.M., I was called out of my home to see some sort of an object which was in the sky.

At the moment that I first saw this object it was no higher than a home. It traveled in the form of a figure 7 This object had a flickering light. When approaching the longest point of the figure 7 there was a very bright light, as if of a flood light. Then a very bright reddish orange. Than an airplane had seemed to be chasing this object, and the object had disappeared somewhere. When the object had been in the air television set would flicker off, and on.

When first seeing the object with a naked eye it seemed to have hundreds of points as if there were figures a nd they were like V/s upside down. When this reached the longest point of the figure 7 than I watched it with a pair of binoculars and could not see some points any more.

I did not need a camera to know what I had seen, so I have made a sketch of the way this object had looked to me. My eyes are in perfect condition, and I know that I did not see swamp gas, nor a balloon tied to a flare, nor even baloney.

Every time this airplane would go closer to this object is would go away from the plane. Perhaps someone is trying to reach us, as we are trying to reach the moon. We may be able to find the solution to this some day. If this object ever lands in our yard I will contact you. I would certainly would like to know what this is, as thousands of others would. This does not frighten me in the least. Perhaps it could be MARS.

I am employed and certainly am not CRAZY!

Dear Sir:

On Monday night march 28 of this year I received a telephone call from a friend of mine Roger Pnock. He told me that he saw 3 UFOs go over his end of town. (Toledo) He wanted me to see if I could see them also.

So the wife and I went out on the front porch. Its heated and looks out over Maumee bay, *or we 14th on the water front in point place.

In about 15 minutes the phone rang again. It was Roger, and he told me he say them again going S.W.E. from his south end of town so the break I thought that I would move to a better vantage point. So out to the break wall I went. In about five minutes time I saw a light, off orange or amber in color to the naked eye. It moved slowly over and following the Maumee River. At Presque Isle and Bay View Park it stopped and remained stationary for about 3 minutes. When I first saw the light it was about 3:28 PM. After the light stopped I returned to the house for my binoculars, upon returning with the wife, I could make out a light separated of red and white. There was no noise, and the range could not have been two miles. My estimate one and a half miles at 1500 ft. Almost half again as high as normally viewed. Wanting to see better, I returned to the house as quickly as possible this time and got the telescope. I changed the lens to a 50 power land lens so that I would be able to see right up and not to over power making it hard to find or follow. I leave the telescope set upon the tripod so I was back in less than a minute. Turning the telescope on the light I could see three very sharp lights, the center 11:nth very white to a point of a blue tint and very bright. On either side of the white light was a smaller red light. The red light on the right side of me or west remained on, as did the white light, but the other red light pulsated. About one second on and one second off.

[Diagram of lights]

Still no sound other than distant street noises. When just above the horizon, behind the light we were watching with the telescope traveling at a high rate of speed from east to west, we saw another light with our naked eye. At this time the lights that we were watching started to move toward us slowly, then arced most west. At this point the white lights got brighter. Whether it was the distance closing, or it actually got brighter would be hard to say for sure. For at this point it was at its nearest, mile or a bit less. We could see over the bay and the lights slowly moved to a parallel position because of the crafts turn. At this point it really started moving still west for a short distance, then up at an angle of about 1:30 in the hour hand of a clock. Always was an audible hum. For just a few seconds not more than 5. This was the only notable sound that we could hear.

From the time it started to really accelerate until it was beyond the telescopes view took about 15 seconds. I must say it left me in awe.

The only difference the wife and I had is in the size of the white light. I thought 3 times as large as the red lights. She said it looked larger, perhaps as is right, for with the binoculars the separation would not be as much as in the telescope, and it would be much easier to compare size.

We did not see any other color of lights, or hear engine noises as normal with air craft. The distance from red light to red light was about 70 ft. later there was a single engine jet craft that came from the north and flew over the same area that the lights remained stationary. Its lights did not begin to fill the telescope in separation the way the two red and the white lights did, nor were they as bright.

On Wednesday we call the Federal Aviation Agcy. and asked if any air craft had running lights as we had seen on Monday night. He said no, another balloon type craft, this type lights either. The wind was N.W. so the craft or light we saw came across wind and then remained stationary in the wind then moved against the wind and then up at a speed I have never seen before.

We thought this information would be of use to you, and help to determine what we saw.

Sincerely,

PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE, TIME GROUP
28 Mar 66     29/0122

2. LOCATION
Toledo, Ohio

3. SOURCE
Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
Astro (STARS/PLANETS)
Photo analysis proves the objects to be the moon and other
celestial objects.

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
10-15

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
8 seconds

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer was in the yard looking for UFO's. He saw 10-15
lights moving in the sky. He took a picture and quickly ran
into the house to tell his parents. The lights were reported
as being bigger than stars but not as bright.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground Visual

The discernable images on the film are felt to be the moon
in its first quarter and other celestial bodies. Motion can
the duration of the sighting here has little meaning since
observer only glanced into the sky and then ran into the
house. The objects were only observed for approx. 8 sec.

7. COURSE
N/A

8. PHOTOS
□ Yes
■ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
□ Yes
■ No

In fact that was the observer taken more time to observe
the objects he would have discovered that they were stars.

The apparent motion of the objects were probably caused by the
movement of the eyes as they scanned the sky.

SUBJECT: UFO (US)

ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA   PI: LAND   DATE: 15 APR 66

Analysis was requested on a polaroid photograph containing a string of objects. All similar in appearance, taken in the vicinity of Toledo, Ohio. Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division (TDPA) and Photo Processing Division (TDDPP) with the following results:

The photograph was unusable for detailed photo analysis due to scratches, fingerprints, lint, and dirt on the print. It is felt that the discernible images are the moon in its first quarter and other celestial bodies.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

A was in my back yard at the time of the sighting. It was the first time I had gone out to look and see if I could see anything since the rash of sightings in southern Michigan. I had with me a Polaroid dingey camera. I was nervous when I quickly snapped the camera picture so I don't think I got it in the picture. If I did it might not even show up since it was night time, and also because it takes such a small and imperfect picture. I am however enclosing the picture for your review. These objects were moving in a different direction than the wind was that night.

My I point out that the two white lines are scratches in the picture made by me while examining it.

Dear Sirs:                                                        March 30, 1966.

On the night of March 28, at approximately 8:20 I spotted in the sky a string of white dim lights about twice the size of stars moving in a whip like pattern out of the south-east towards the north-west. There were to the best of my knowledge 10 - 15 of these separate lights following each other at what seemed to be very close. I have no idea at all of the altitude of these objects. I live in the south end of Toledo and upon seeing these objects I called the Toledo police and reported it to them. They told me at this time a lady in Trilby Ohio, which is just North of Toledo spotted the same string of objects. The same night many Toledoans reported seeing an object but this is now believed to be only a hoax. In the papers it had no mention of the lights which I and the lady reported. I am very interested in knowing what it is that I saw. If you have any idea would you be kind enough to let me know. Thank you for your trouble.   Fred Hoor/3365 Airport Hwy./Toledo, Ohio

Proposed reply to letter from [blacked out]

Dear Mr [blacked out]

Reference your letter requesting our evaluation of your 23 March 1966 observation. A detailed photo analysis of the photograph was not possible because of scratches, fingerprints, lint, and dirt on the print. It is felt that the discernible images are those of the moon in its first quarter and other celestial bodies.

We wish you had spent more time observing the objects so that a more detailed account of the observation would have been possible.

A study of the submitted data did not reveal a positive explanation, but it appears that astronomical bodies were observed.

Enclosed is the photograph you made available for analysis.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Mr.

References your letter requesting our evaluation of your March 23, 1966 observation.

A detailed photo analysis of the photograph was not possible because of scratches, fingerprints, lint, and dirt on the print. It is felt that the discernible images are those of the moon in its first quarter and other celestial bodies. We wish you had spent more time observing the objects so that a more detailed account of the observation would have been possible. A study of the submitted data did not reveal a positive explanation, but it appears that astronomical bodies were observed.

Attached is the photograph you made available for analysis.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.

(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound   There was no sound to be any
b. Color   bluish white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The covered part was about 1/2 of the object was covered.
The covered part would have been about 1/2 of the object would have been covered.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

UFO-Watching
Newest 'Sport'
Of Area Residents

ELIOT - The newest sport in
this town is watching UFO's, or
unidentified flying objects.

In the old days, boys and girls
parked on lonely country roads
to "spark" a bit, but nowadays
in Eliot, most of the parkers are
looking for space ships and little
green men therein.

Friday night in East Eliot,
there were at least a dozen
parked vehicles whose occupants were scanning the skies
for sight of a UFO.

A number of people reported
hearing "strong beeping
sounds" and there was an area
near the gravel pit off Goodwin
Road, where some felt "something" may have landed.

The reasoning was that a
number of trees were crushed
and branches broken. Those who
inspected the area didn't believe
the damage could have been
done by snow and ice.

Earlier in the week, some
other people saw a "thing"
over Spencer Creek, and on
Wednesday three men driving
along Beech Road observed
something in the sky near the
power lines, and followed it.

The "thing" was making
"erratic motions" and was moving quite rapidly.

The men followed it toward
Kittery down Route 236, caught
up with it or near it, before it
veered off and vanished.

One woman reported finding
some odd "plastic type object"
near her home.

Although the UFO activity
have come mostly from Eliot,
there was a rumor that a spaceship, or "something" landed a
few nights ago on the beach in
Rye.

In fact, police checked out a
report of a "loud beeping" near
one home, and when they went
there found out the beeping was
really peeping from a frog pond.

Noise appeared simultaneously on Channel 10 m a local television station and on 960 KC on a radio station. It could not be determined if these signals coincided exactly with the auditory signals heard outdoors in Rochester. The signals have not reoccurred since 29 March.

ATTN OF: Directorate of Information (BDXI)                   2 9 MAR 1966

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO:    AFSC (FTD)

1. Attached are two preliminary reports of alleged UFO sightings, forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

2. Also, enclosed is a clipping from the local newspaper, containing an article on UFO interest in the local area.

3. I believe the newspaper article will help in part to explain the "sighting". There has been a normal amount of interest generated locally since the recent "Michigan sightings." With more people looking for flying saucers more people will undoubtedly "see" them.

4. I don't believe the two enclosed reports require any further follow-up action. One can be attributed to over-active imaginations possibly aided by aircraft sightings on a cloudy night. The other could possibly be some sort of radio transmission from a "ham" radio or even due to frogs.

Flying Intruders from
Outer Space?
B. P. I. - Take Notice!
Strange noises have been noted recently in this vicinity. They have been described as a pulsating, be-eping sound, loud enough at times to be heard indoors. They come mostly at night and have been heard in various parts of the village by several residents. It has been conjectured that they may be caused by "ham" radio operators, by some errant and strange animal or even as a "signal from outer space." We suggest that an investigation be made without delay.

UM "OBJECTO ESTRANHO"
NO CÉU DE NAMPULA
OBSERVADO DEMORADADAMENTE
POR DIVERSAS PESSOAS
Por INÁCIO DE PASSOS (Da nossa Delegação em Nampula)

NAMPULA, 27 — A vida de Sábado em Nampula encerrava-se com uma sessão de boxe. A ela acorrera grande parte da população confiante nas promessas propagandistas de ambos os lutadores que ofereciam à cidade vitória. Depois um café apressado, os desejos de boa-noite e a cidade adormecia.

A noite estava clara e sem véu, limpa. A sua volta a presença humana. E quente. O ar agitava-se queimando a rua. A vida noturna que a cidade se oferece a quem a ela vive. Mas as ruas nem de todo estavam desertas; apenas os cafés sentiam a sua voz nos sentidos.

Eram duas horas, e o encerramento das últimas cafés dava lugar para os lares os poucos noctívagos. Mas a noite continuava convidando e sentia-se a sua voz nos sentidos.

UM «OBJECTO LUMINOSO»
PARA OS LADOS DE NAMPULO

Para os lados do Namalo em objecto luminoso grande, estranhamente quieto, que não era estrela. Fixo, ou parece fixo. O carro rodava na sua direcção e em velocidade quilométricas foram vencidos.

De súbito que as curvas captaram que claramente ofereciam perspectivas uma imagem iluminadora por luz intensa e de intensidade estranha, para logo se mostrar como nava de ficção científica suspensa, curiosa, no firmamento. Mais brilhantes e o carro estacionava.

Apaga a luz! — murmura uma voz nervosa.

Repara nas antenas! — responde o artista Diretio.

ESPECTÁCULO DIGNO
DE SER VISTO

Ficámos na estrada junto ao carro. Os olhos não se despegavam de espectáculo inédito que continua CONTINUA NA PÁGINA SEGUINTE

Here is the text from the newspaper article:

6--The Fairborn Daily Herald, Monday, March 28, 1966

Strange Flying Object Is
Spotted in Columbus, Ga.
COLUMBUS, Ga.(UPI)--
An airport-control tower
operator reported seeing a
glowing, oblong object maneuvering high in the sky
yesterday. He said it was
tracked on radar.

Six Columbus policemen,
and a control tower operator at Ft. Benning, Ga.,
also said they saw the
strange object.

Doyle Palmer, an air traffic control operator at Muscogee County airport, said
he first spotted the greenish white, cigar shaped object at about 5:30 a.m., and
that it was tracked on radar
at Atlanta for over an hour.

Palmer said he had first

thought the object was a
star, "but you don't pick up
stars on radar." He said he
could still see it clearly
after the sun came up.

When stars normally disappeared -- but by that time it
had shrunk to the size of a
pin head and was moving
southeast.

Columbus police detective
G. H. Ferguson said he
spotted the object after
hearing radio reports about
it. He described the glowing
thing as wedge-shaped and
said he saw it rising in the
air. He reported it was
much brighter and moved
faster than a star. Ferguson
said he observed the object
until after 7 a.m.

UFO Photograph

Mrs. [redacted]
[redacted]

Reference your unidentified photograph that was taken at 1100 hours, 27 March 1966 at Orlando, Florida. Photo analysis has been completed with the following results:

a. The character of the five images suggest that the photograph was taken through a plate glass window or through an open doorway with no overhead transmission. The images appear as reflections from overhead rectangular ceiling light panels positioned to the rear and above the camera, possible unnoticed by the photographer prior to taking the photograph.

b. Any further detailed analysis would depend upon the receipt of additional information relating to the camera position, light sources and relative location to any surrounding reflective surfaces.

SIGHTING: 27 March 1966, Dayton, Ohio

Miss [redacted], W-P AFB, Ohio observed an object on the night of 27 March 1966 at the Dixie Drive-in. Object went N to SW, looked to be high as airplane.

Saw it for just a few minutes. Looked like a star. Observed 1145 or 12 pm. Looking through the windshield, object went over the screen.

Major Quintanilla said we had a couple of reports for satellites at that time last night (when she observed object). She said it looked like satellite. (It is quite possible that she had her directions off slightly).

THE SKETCH SHOWS APPARENT SIZE THRU 16 X 50 BINOCULARS. THE SAME CLOSELY APPROXIMATED THAT OF A FOLDED PAPER AIRPLANE. NO WINGS WERE APPARENT. VISIBLE ABOUT 8-10 SECONDS (TRAVERSED ABOUT 120° ACROSS VISUAL SPACE). SINCE THE DRIFT WAS TRAVELLING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, THE GREEN LIGHT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE LEFT WING AND THE RED LIGHT BEHIND THE NOSE, AND THE RED LIGHT ON THE LEFT WING SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVISIBLE BECAUSE OF THE LOW VIEWING ANGLE. ALSO, ORDINARILY THE WHITE LIGHT WOULD NOT BE BELOW THE FUSELAGE. NOTE THE TITLE GREEN LIGHT IS AT THE EXTREME POINT OF THE NOSE, WHILE THE RED LIGHT IS ABOUT THE WHITE LIGHT AT THE TAIL. THIS IS CONTRARY TO FAA REGULATIONS.

Unusual object seen travelling
E to W approx 10° above 5
horizon. Appeared to be approx
1 mile away. Was close then
aircraft which followed similar
path (alths slightly higher) a
few minutes later.)

The object was moving much
faster than later prop jet a/c,
but was also fairly silent.
No sound could be heard,
altho the area was quiet.
Other place was quite noisy.
