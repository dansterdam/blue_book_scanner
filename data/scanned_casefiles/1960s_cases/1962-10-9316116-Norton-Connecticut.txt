Sat. 27 Oct. 1962

Lat. 41° 03.75' No., Long. 73° 29.25' W.

U. F. O. Headquarters,
Bolling A.F.B.,
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir,

This evening at 7:44 E.S.T. I was watching satellite 1960 Iota 1 (Echo 1) transit at about 85° altitude South, when I saw what looked like a typical slow but unusually faint and persisting meteor going S.E. from about 45° altitude (about dec. 0°, R.A. 23hr.). I immediately put my 7X50 binoculars on it and followed it for about 3 seconds when it went behind a tree in the S.E. at an altitude of about 20° (about dec. 30° S., R.A. 2hr.)

I could discern no color with the binoculars but its shape was a band about 0.1° wide and 0.5° long, brightest in the center third and fading toward the ends. The length of the band was parallel to the line of flight.

The sky was very clear. It did not have any similarity to or is there any likelihood that it was the end of a search light beam. I did not detect any change in intensity.

Was this reported to you by any other observer? Can you suggest what it was?

If this letter is improperly addressed, will you please forward it?

Sincerely yours,

Edgerton Memorial Planetarium,
Stamford (Conn.) Museum & Nature Center
