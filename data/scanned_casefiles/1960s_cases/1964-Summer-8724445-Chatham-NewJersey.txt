10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Apparently the lady sees things others do not see, since a few seconds is apparently the time for her to point the final of the three objects out to her friends. Case too old to investigate and quality of data too poor to offer any valid suggestions as to the cause of the display.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observation at about 2130 on a summer night in 1964, reported to the Air Force in a letter in 1965. Witness was looking WEST asking to others looked NW and saw an object that appeared to move silently Westward. Looked like a blue light but was not glowing and had no trail. Sped was too fast for 3/5 and too slow for meteor. Disappeared before anyone could turn around and see it. About one minute later a light that looked like the funnel of a tornado appeared in the Southern sky. This light lasted a few seconds. Nothing happened after that.

Dear Miss

This is in reply to your letter concerning aerial observations which you have made.

If you had reported your observations to the Air Force at the time of the sighting, an investigation would have been made. At this late date, it is not feasible to attempt an investigation towards a solution of your observations.

I am enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on this subject. I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

To Whom IT May Concern:

My Name is [redacted], I'm 15 years old and I live at:
Chatham, New Jersey

I am now staying at:
Sunnyvale, California

Last summer, 1964, I saw an odd sight in the sky. It wasn't until I read the book, "Flying Saucers and the U. S. Air Force," by Lt. Col. Lawrence J. Tacker U.S.A.F., that I decided that I should write to you, and that I didn't write immediately.

It was about 9:30 at night. Three friends and I were out talking. I was facing West they were facing East. I was talking and just happened to look up when

out of nowhere in the Northern
sky an object this shape,
appeared and silently moved
Westward. It was like a blue
light, but not glowing and if
had no tail. It moved to fast
for a plane, but to slow for
a meteorite. Before anyone
could turn around it disappeared
behind some trees. Not more
then a minute had gone by
when a flash of light
appeared in the Western
sky. A minute later toward
the Southern sky I saw
a light that looked like
this: [hand-drawn sketch of a cone/funnel shape]
It disappeared in
seconds. Nothing happened after
that.

I would have written you
that night, but my friends said
that you would think I was
playing a joke. Now I know
That I was wrong and that
