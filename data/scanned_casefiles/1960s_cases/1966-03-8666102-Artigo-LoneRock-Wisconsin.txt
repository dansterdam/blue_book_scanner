K. MAJ JOHN G. MC KIBBEN ASST. OPERATIONS OFFICER. THE OBSERVER STATED
THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY BRIGHT, WHITER THAN STARS, AND LARGER THAN STARS. IN THE REPORTING OFFICER'S OPINION
THIS SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE THE DESCRIPTION OF A WEATHER BALLOON.
I PERSONALLY SAW A WEATHER BALLOON AT DUSK, ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO
IN PANAMA, AND THIS DESCRIPTION IS MUCH THE SAME AS I WOULD HAVE
GIVEN, HAD I NOT KNOWN WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. IN THIS REPORT IT WAS
JUST BEFORE DAWN AND WHEN I SAW THE WX BALLOON IT WAS AT DUSK. IN
BOTH CASES THE LIGHT RAYS OF THE SUN WERE HIGH IN THE SKY EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS DARK OR NEARLY DARK ON THE GROUND
