6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". INDICATE WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

    MANY                        MOON WITH HALO
                                MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS
    UNKNOWN                     PARTIAL (New or quarter)

D. IF SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE? □ YES   □ NO. IF "YES," WHERE WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED
    THE PHENOMENON?
    IN FRONT OF YOU             TO YOUR RIGHT                   OVERHEAD (Near noon)
    IN BACK OF YOU              TO YOUR LEFT                    UNKNOWN

E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR
   STREET LAMP, ETC. FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY DISTANCE TO LIGHT SOURCE.

   It was naturally light-main source-moon and headlights
   some street-highway overhead lights

12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER
    IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER EDGES WERE SHARP OR FUZZY. DESCRIBE THE SHAPE OR INDICATE IF IT
    APPEARED AS A POINT OF LIGHT. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR
    OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

    Object was source of light which seemed to
    rotate every one-half second-very fast pulsation. Only bright,
    white light was visible-other sign of running lights. When
    first seen-object was stationary and then started west and at
    approx. 6-800 miles per hour. No detail of shape could be seen-
    just the pulsating or rotating light-did not resemble any object
    in field of view. Object appeared as planet in brightness-as
    bright as Jupiter or moon (Jupiter was visible to the northwest
    of object-moon to the north).

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON When I first saw object-it appeared
as the planet Jupiter-it was stationary and then seemed to rotate
and started moving quite fast. I then saw aircraft come around it

same from all angles. It changed altitude twice quite suddenly-
went right up and then came back to former position.

Went over horizon
