The image contains three illustrations. The top one is a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction to a phenomenon when first seen. The two illustrations below show sketches of a person's perspective when observing a UFO or other phenomenon in the sky.

Here is the text I have extracted from the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X AT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". APPEAR TO BE STATIONARY, CURVED OR ZIGZAGGED, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PORTION.

The image appears to contain a form titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE". The form includes a sketch or diagram, but no photographic image is present in this particular page. 

Transcribing the text from the form:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED FOR EVALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY. RETURN TO AIR FORCE BASE BY ________________________. INVESTIGATOR FOR FORWARDING TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch showing the shape of a phenomenon that the observer described. The sketch depicts some mountains or hills in the background, with the main focus being an object in the sky described as "INCANDANTS" (possibly referring to "incandescent" objects).

OCR output:

16 DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS, INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
