   (6) Discernible features: None.
   (7) Tail: None.
   (8) Sound: None.

b. Description of course of object:
   (1) Mrs [redacted] (person interviewed) was hanging clothes, heard a low-flying jet, looked up and noticed this hovering object.
   (2) Object was first observed hovering at a very high altitude, slightly northwest of her overhead position.
   (3) Object maintained same approximate altitude, slowly drifted westward and disappeared.
   (4) Flight path consisted of drifting to west, returning to original position for a short time, then drifting westward again.

(6) Mrs. [redacted] stated she observed the object for approximately 10 minutes.

c. Manner of observation:
(1) Ground visual.
(2) None.
(3) Not applicable.

d. Time and date of incident:
(1) 1734Z - 28 January 1965.
(2) Light conditions: day.

e. Location of observer: [redacted], Hampton, Virginia.

f. Identifying information ob observer:
(1) Mrs. [redacted] civilian, housewife, Hampton, Virginia.

g. Weather and winds: Aloft conditions at time and place of sightings:
(1) Observer's account of weather conditions: clear - windy.
(2) Wind direction and velocity (Norfolk Weather Bureau) 1200L:

Surface:        260/15-25
6000            260/35
1KM             260/47
16M             250/79
20M             260/86
30M             260/118
50-80 M winds were too high for balloon reading.

(3) Ceiling: clear.
(4) Visibility: 10 miles.
(5) Amount of cloud cover: None.
(6) TRW: None.

(7) Vertical temperature gradient: Not taken except at
0600L. Figures below:

0600           28 January 1965
Surface temperature: 4.4C
300 meters (900') - 2.8C (This is a small inversion that
would disappear before 1200)
1300 meters - 5.3C (An inversion at this altitude)
4100 meters - 14.8C
4300 meters - 18.5C
Then normal rate to 8360 meters (25,000').

h. No unusual meteorological activities or conditions were reported.

i. There was no interception or immediate identification action taken
because the object had disappeared prior to the reporting time.

j. Norfolk Weather Bureau stated that a balloon had been launched
from their facility at 1215E (19 minutes prior to the sighting). However
their balloon drifted rapidly eastward and should not have reached the
position of the sighting at any time.

k. This report was prepared by Captain Page G. Brake, USAF, 4500
Air Base Wing (DOQ-HQ), Langley AFB, Virginia. The description of this UFO
sighting was given by Mrs. [redacted] to Captain Brake via telephone conversation on 28 January 1965. No personal interview was accomplished as
possible explanations was leaving town that evening for a few days. Several
to, and a definite statement made that this was what was seen. Mrs. [redacted]
stated repeatedly that numerous jet aircraft were observed in the immediate
vicinity of the sighting. No aircraft reported any unusual events or
sightings during the period. She also stated the object seemed to be higher
than the contrails the aircraft were leaving. At certain high altitudes it
is possible for an aircraft to leave an intermittent contrail which a ground
observer could possibly identify as a hovering or slowly flying craft. Due
to the large amount of jet traffic at the time of this sighting and due to
the fact that no airborne craft reported this phenomena I feel this to be
the most probable cause of the reported incident.

(1) No physical evidence was reported to exist.

(2) The observer stated she probably would not have reported this
incident if there had not been so many UFO reports of late and that she
wanted to do all she could to help.
