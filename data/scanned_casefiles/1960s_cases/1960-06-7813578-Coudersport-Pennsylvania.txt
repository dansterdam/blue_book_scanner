Date: 2/11/63

Several of these have been seen here before. They always travel from East to West, usually to East. Some are large + some are small. They go from a stop to 40,000 (?) MPH. Some have a blue green (like a light blue) front of them. They could work on the magnetic fields of the Earth. I would like all possible information on these sightings + others.

Jan. 29, 1963

Dear Sirs,

These days I have been thinking of a way to ask you this. I live on a farm in North Central Pennsylvania, and I have a new telescope which I got a little while ago.

For many years now my families and families have been seeing strange "flying" objects over head, not to high in the air. Some of them have come very close to us and I am other people have seen them.

I have been doing on the side that say something about the US Government. I know they belong to you and would like to know
