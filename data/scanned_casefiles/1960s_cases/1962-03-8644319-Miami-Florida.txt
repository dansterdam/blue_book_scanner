I apologize, but the image appears to be almost entirely blank or extremely faded. There is no legible text visible on this page. The image shows a mostly white/gray document with some very faint dots or specks, and a vertical line on the right side of the page, but no readable text can be discerned.

The text I can clearly read from the document is:

The rest of the document appears to be extremely faded or blacked out, making the text illegible.

Dear Col. Friend:

I feel that it is first necessary to identify myself as [redacted], one of the amateur astronomers who saw the object or objects over South Florida from the residence of [redacted] on January 25, 1960. A report was made to the Homestead Air Force Base which in turn was forwarded on to you. Through a telephone call made by Professor Hynek of Northwestern University to [redacted] (one of our group) we learned the report had been forwarded to him. When told by [redacted] that I had observed the objects the second time on March 6, 1962 he suggested I send a report to him and also report the second observation to you.

I am very sorry that I am so late in sending this report to you. I have been working on a Science Fair project on Astrophotography. I took the grand prize at my school (Palm Springs Jr. High School) and a Special award at the South Florida Science Fair. This part of class in with my report, for I photographed the objects on the second observation while working on my Science Fair project.

I am sending you the report only of the second observation as I feel

you are well informed of the first observation. I will proceed with the report first in outline form.

1. Second Observation
A. Date: March 6, 1962
B. Time: 8:35 PM EST
C. Magnitude: 1.5 visually, 1.9 photographically
D. Color: Red-orange
E. Speed: Covered most of sky in 17 seconds.
F. Number: 4 visually, 5 photographically
G. Direction first seen: Northeast
H. Direction last seen: Northwest
I. Direction traveling: West
J. Approximate altitude: Low, 15,000 - 30,000 ft.

On March 6, 1962 I was observing in search of Comet Seki-Lines 1962Q but a deep haze in the south hindered my observation. I decided to take a 1 minute exposure of the Perseus area. At 8:35 PM EST, about 30 seconds after I opened the shutter of the 8/3.5 35mm camera, four objects in diamond formation of magnitude 1.5 appeared in the north-eastern skies in Ursa Major. They were traveling directly west but not due west. They were red-orange in color and seemed to be at a low altitude. They continued across the sky, going directly through the camera field, and disappeared in the northwestern skies. This observation lasted 17 seconds.

I trained my 7X50mm binoculars on them, finding them diffused with a star-like nucleus. Extremely small disks could barely be distin-

guished in the 7X50 binoculars.

The photograph shows three 1.9 magnitude objects (the first and last objects forming overlapping trails on the film). After processing a fifth object was visible on the photograph of magnitude 4.5. This object was not visually observed because the binoculars' field is not that wide.

I am enclosing the photograph and also sending a report to Professor Hynek at Northwestern University.

Respectfully,

Hialeah, Florida

Dear Bob:

You remember the Florida case of January 25, 1962 and the fact that I called one of the amateur astronomers down there who had made the sighting. He promised to send me the data and he finally now has gotten around to it. I enclose his letter which I think should be filed with the other data in the case. You will note that he sends a photograph which looks for all the world to be like light's of a plane. However, the plane would have to be quite low down and there didn't seem to be any plane around at the time of any notice. Further, it covered most of the sky in 15 to 20 seconds. The photograph, inclusively, is of the second observation on March 6, 1952.

In view of the reliability of the observers and the photographic evidence and this excellent reporting, I think we should look at this case quite seriously. Let's put this on the agenda for a joint discussion at our next meeting. Let me know when you plan to be here.

Cordially,
[Signature of J. Allen Hynek]

Dear Professor Hynak:

I feel that it is first necessary to identify myself as one of the amateur astronomers who saw the object or objects over South Florida from the residence of [redacted] on January 25, 1960. I observed the objects a second time on March 6, 1960.

I am very sorry that I am so late in sending this report to you. I have been working on a Science Fair project on Astrophotography. I took the grand prize at my school (Palm Springs Jr. High School) and a Superior award at the South Florida Science Fair. This sort of ties in with my report, for I photographed the objects on the second observation while working on my Science Fair project.

I will proceed with the report first in outline form:

I. First Observation
    A. Date: January 25, 1960
    B. Time: 9:05 PM EST
    C. Longitude: 2 Approx.
    D. Speed: Covered most of sky in 15 - 30 seconds
    E. Number: 4
    F. Direction first seen: South


- page 9 -

G. Direction last seen: North
H. Direction traveling: North
I. Approximate Altitude: Low, 15,000 - 30,000 ft.

Second Observation:
A. Date: March 6, 1962
B. Time: 8:35 PM EST
C. Magnitude: 1.5 visually, 1.9 photographically
D. Color: Red-orange
E. Speed: Covered most of sky in 17 seconds.
F. Number: 4 visually, 5 photographically
G. Direction first seen: Northeast
H. Direction last seen: Northwest
I. Direction traveling: West
J. Approximate altitude: Low, 15,000 - 30,000 ft.

First observation:
The sky was hazy in the south and quite bright in the north (because of Miami city lights.) At the time we [redacted], and myself) had a 6-inch reflector, a 2.4-inch refractor, 8X50mm binoculars, astro-cam (for the 6-inch), a 4-inch astrograph, a 35mm camera, and a reflex camera as our equipment. At 9:05 PM one of the boys (either [redacted]) exclaimed, "There goes a meteor!" On first sight [redacted] I thought it was a blim with advertising lights on the sides. It had the appearance of a fuzzy line about 10° long in the constellation of Orion. It appeared to be traveling faster than a blimp and could be discerned as four (4) objects when it reached the zenith (near H35). They appeared to approximately magnitude 2 with a red-orange color. As the objects crossed the zenith and continued northwest, they crossed the constellation of Auriga.

Here is the text from the document:

Having the 4-inch astrograph opened in the immediate area was able
to photograph them. As they disappeared in the bright city lights
the seemed to take a diamond formation. The entire phenomenon lasted
approximately 15 - 20 seconds.

Second observation:

On March 5, 1962 I was observing in search of Comet Seki-Lines 1962a
but a deep haze in the south hindered my observation. I decided to
take a 1 minute exposure of the Perseus area. At 8:35 PM, about 30
seconds after I opened the shutter of the f/2.5 35mm camera, for objects in diamond formation of magnitude 1.5 appeared in the northwestern skies in Ursa Major. They were traveling directly west but
not due west. They were red-orange in color and seemed to be at a
low altitude. They continued across the sky, going directly through
the camera field, and disappeared in the northwestern skies. This
observation lasted 17 seconds.

I trained my 7X50m binoculars on them, finding them diffused with
a star-like nucleus. Extremely small disk could barely be distinguished in the 7X50 binoculars.

The photograph shows three 1.9 magnitude objects (the first and last
objects forming overlapping trails on the film.) After processing
a fifth object was visible on the photograph of magnitude 4.5. This
object was not visually observed because the binoculars' field is not
that wide.

I am enclosing the photograph of my second observation.
