10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj's of sighting is probably a non-persistent turns and moved as if making turns in the instance of non-persistent trails. Witness was tracking the a/c and the trail in which the a/c is moving. The red hued object appeared to move out of bounds for a condensation trail. Length cannot be stated and temp of air depends upon available data.

11. COMMENTS
Condensation trail. Witness reports that obj gives the illusion of motion in the trail. Reported by witness is an attempt to explain the red hued object being out of bounds for a condensation trail. Length of trail depends upon factors such as moisture content and temperature of air. Length is no evidence available which maximizes above factors as well as speed of a/c.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
[X] Other Condensation trail
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

Gentlemen:

I am writing as a citizen interested in a matter that seems to be of great public importance, namely the identity of mysterious flying objects that have been reported in all times and places for the past fifteen or so years. The objects of which I am writing were seen by me last night from 6182 r.t. until about 6:30 r.t. I am a Detroit school teacher, and while a news reporter not people's one so hysterical. I am enclosing the clipping from the Detroit news of this date, which explains the general nature of the object. Nearly three hundred calls to the news by citizens who were startled by the object. The facts as I can relate them provide definitely that the theory of central call* not possibly exist *the phenomenon. I am interested in the real nature of the object and believe, I know, in the familiar theory of hush a theory that seems to call but scientific explanation.

We saw at 6102 an object that seemed like a flame tube in the sky at an elevation of some 20 degrees, at a direction some 15 degrees south of a true north bearing along the Fendale area. I drew hope for others and will not speak of my personal experience just now. I then drove for some three miles toward the object. It was to a point further to the northwest across similar object. But here more nearly north, which was more angular like a glass bulb. Sky could be less bright than the setting sun - this was a peculiar point. As I drove, I saw two narrow objects, cloud turned until its end was toward me. It had the form of a circle about a quarter of its length. In the 16 years I have seen many such sightings, but this was the most impressive. From such a vantage point I could see the object had built out of a long, tall, oval shape. It had turned quite red in the haze of the setting sun. I believe the object had disappeared somehow to the north, unlike larger and closer nor disappear in the distance. I think by but a mile or so.

I called the Detroit News and was told that there had been some 25 calls during the past half hour. The speaker gave the explanation that appeared in the press, namely, and this: a control would not exist, progress, turn side to end and back again. I still believe, however, that the object was a disc. Later he called my sister-in-law, who was with me, and told her that calls had come in from a distance from the phenomenon in the windows of the News.

I talked with my neighbor-in-law and found that she had watched the thing from the south. She looked west on 8th Street at about 12 miles to the south. She described it as a tremendous white object, as a first sign of it. An application* was made to my left as I first saw it. An angle between a line of traverse at an azimuth between thirty and sixty miles. A radio* measurement at arms length would give a ratio of one fourth inch to 30 feet, between eyes and its proper place. This ratio placed the object of a size somewhere between .3 and .5 miles in length, with a

sickness of some quarter or what incredible length. As I talked in my school today with the librarian, "Miss ___" she told me that at times she has seen to be a long thin streak she had seen to a phenomenon from a place in Canada some thirty miles south and west of Detroit.

The contrail idea is preposterous for a number of reasons. In the first place, the contrail would not be an isolated, short timing streak. It would not change color with a distance and have effect, and certainly could not sustain a brightness that would dim and resume original position. I could not travel with a 16 mm or a long distance in a raid time. For a contrail to travel would imply a high wind force which would quickly dissipate to a contrail cloud. I am certain, as they seemed to appear in the sky without any mass as to height or distance.

I am certainly not writing this with any idea as to notoriety or claim to fame or argument, but from interest. Since a mysterious sighting of two strange luminous objects in the same area, I was concerned. I was interviewed by an official. Citing details, I have been interested in a matter of unexplained flying objects that in my trial to observe these as closely as I could. I have other time can see no reason why I believe what I was in 1953 that if a man could walk so well on so-called UFOs seen at night in west. In this case, any reasonable explanation accompanied a tonne-increase-skeptic, as if any writer were unwilling to accept calling, and hope to demonstrate what? Two or three things come to a person who call for a home. I am give willing to affirm this in any way you might request. It is no hoax, but perhaps no writing could substantiate.

Sincerely,

Evaluation of Source Reliability: PROBABLY GOOD

Analysis and Conclusions:
THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING IS PROBABLY A NON-PERSISTENT CONDENSATION TRAIL. THE WITNESS REPORTS THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO MAKE TRAILS AND MOVE AS A UNIT. THE MOTION OF THIS CONDENSATION TRAIL IS AN ILLUSION IN THE INSTANCE OF NON-PERSISTENT TRAILS THE AIRCRAFT IS GENERATING AT THE ONE END AND THE TRAIL AT THE DISSIPATING AT THE OTHER. THIS GIVES THE ILLUSION OF MOTION. IN THE OBSERVED CONDITION THE AIRCRAFT IS MOVING THE END COLOR REPORTED BY THE WITNESS IS
