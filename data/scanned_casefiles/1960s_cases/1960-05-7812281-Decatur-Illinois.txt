B. M. on located on the east
corner of the entrance of
U.S. Route 36 - first road east
of Lake Decatur.

The proof of the existence
of three properties (short) chemical
plants - is plainly - shown where
the line has been shot past lines
of limits - The limits are
rather shown entirely of classes
to the lines' official classified area.

Of great importance also seem
to be these beams - from my
immediate area - that are swing
towards the U.S.R. 36 - the bridge
over the Lake -

I want to mention just what
the Sheriff's office last year
saw the pictures of these chemicals - some pictures
(pictures put little) preferred
to elline - The chemical plans were
brought with the city of the pictures

2. [Redacted] letter is quite lacking in detail regarding the situation under which the photos were taken.

3. If [redacted] could forward the negatives and the color photos which she mentions as well as information concerning the camera designation, exposure details and the exact time and date that each photo was taken it is possible that an explanation could be made.

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFIL
ATTENTION: Major Kelly

SUBJECT: UFO Inquiry - Miss [redacted]

1. It is recommended that no reply be sent in answer to Miss Hott's latest letter addressed to President Eisenhower, and the file on this individual be marked closed.

2. Miss [redacted]'s letter is completely disjointed and indicates a great amount of hysteria on her part concerning various objects she sees in the sky.

3. If you feel you must reply to Miss [redacted] in order to return the photographs she has again submitted through the White House, you might again state that the original negatives of the photographs are needed together with the information stated in our letter of 26 July.

4. In this instance, it probably would be much better to file all the correspondence together with the photographs and mark the file "closed".

Representative William Springer
House of Representatives
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I live at the east corner of U.S. 36 and North Country
Club Rd. This is east of the Lake, North of U.S. Route 36, from
this immediate area (1 mile Sq & larger) I've seen continuously
for the past approx year & a half chemical flares shot towards
major industry's including our Signal Corps area, R. R. terminals
I've taken many pictures of these flares in flight. I took my first
picture the night the flares were in such numbers and of such size
and going towards the airport. The naught air port that night burnt
down. The flares were being shot from the west corner of our
intersection here and across the lake NW of here. These flares
are also aimed at airplanes in flight. I've reported them to the
Illinois State Security office, local police, and sheriff's office --
and the civil defense office (and apparently the sheriff's office tho
seeing the pictures still did not believe this was so).

Here recently I've tried to take some more pictures of flares
going towards the planes at night and I had odd results. All my
pictures are having the same result. I'm enclosing these pictures and
believe it's really subversive at work in our country, and they seem
to be trying to affect a fake radiation score. I've had these pictures
examined and they tell me in a picture of a "hot object" I told them
I did not understand the meaning of heat - hot - I did get stings and
deep muscle cramps from these areas and they said I would if exposed
to them.

My dogs apparently have tracked this prowlers at night and
now these beams are hitting my dogs and cat. One dog's eyesight is
affected. The 2nd dog has been developing tumors that, are possibly
cancerous on his tail, and now my cat's eye is affected. These beams
at all levels are colors of orange, blue, white, pale beige and a few
red and greenish beams also the beams are distinctly aimed at
"J. G. Route 36 additionally. I've encountered such things all the way
to Springfield, Illinois, and here recently when I flew to St. Louis
I've seen chemical flares enroute and all around the Springfield airport.
I aimed at the Capitol bldg and we have such flares around our local
airport. I'll be glad to go further in detail to any defense agency, you
would suggest, Mr. Springer I want to add at times of election these
previously named conditions increase terrifically I believe this is a
very serious interference with our American way of living. I would
appreciate a reply. Very sincerely, Dorothy A. Holt
