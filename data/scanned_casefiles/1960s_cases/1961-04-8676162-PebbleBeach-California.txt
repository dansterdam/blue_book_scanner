10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object like a very bright star with ring of
red and green. Stationary about 3 times normal star. Slightly larger
than a normal star. Seen from Pebble Beach
object first noticed was over Pebble Beach over
water about 30 deg above horizon. Initial
observation object seemed stationary. About
5 minutes later the object disappeared to the
North, still at same observation.

11. COMMENTS
Object could not have been a balloon as
the direction of motion was against the
wind. No a/c would have been over a small
warning area, and should have appeared to
gain altitude as it moved toward the
observer. The plan t. Jupiter was in the
position indicated and had a magnitude
of -1. The witness probably observed
the planet Jupiter.
