FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 66                                                                    21 Oct 63

The affair happened on a very isolated farm situated 3 km. from the town of Trancas and about 78 km. north of the Provincial Capital of Tucuman.

Three were the people in the house, the seventy-three-year-old Senor Antonio Moreno, his wife aged sixty-three, three of their adult daughters, three sons of one of these daughters, and a fifteen-year-old servant girl. It must be remembered that Moreno family are not paranormal folk, but important people in the Province, their son Dr. Moreno being a consultant to the municipal government of Tucuman City.

It was 9:30 p.m. on October 21, 1963, and the household were preparing to go to bed, when the matter began. Dora Martin Guzman looked over towards the tracks of the Belgrano Railway Line, which passes at a distance of about 200 yards from the house. Suddenly, and something intensely bright began walking across the garden towards the house.

At this point there is some discrepancy in the various reports. Some say that Senora Julia and her mother Dora Teresa Karina de Moreno both began walking across the garden towards the front gate, while others say that the daughter was, however, turned back again to get a lantern, and set this up some where near the gate, presumably intending to venture out further in the direction of the mystery.

In the meantime they had seen something decidedly odd happen on the railway line, for it seemed as though one half of the luminous "train" suddenly shot away from the rest. If few, just skimming above the ground, for a distance of half a mile or so, and could clearly be seen to consist of three circular objects. Nor one of the accounts is very clear at this point.

Meanwhile, as soon as the women had set up the lantern, and as though in response to it, one of the brilliant beams of light emanating from one of the machines on or above the railway track at once turned from white to violet, and was switched round so as to play upon the two women in the garden. They immediately were overcome by a sort of paralysis, and predicting or tingling sensations in the body, and were obliged to run back into the house.

The beam now turned from violet to red, and was playing steadily upon the house. Inside, the terrified family proceeded to hide the children in different places in the house, and for the next forty minutes they all covered there in too. In brief, it looks as though the Trancas case was a defensive rather than an offensive or a manhunting operation.

But why this penchant for landing on our railway tracks? There have already been quite a number of cases with this feature, and I hope that some of our scientific friends are thinking about it.

One thought occurs: Is this a SALTA-CORDOVA-BAHIA BLANCA Magnetic Zone? (See map.)

Is this one of the ferromagnetic elements? Is it this that draws them to our railway lines?

San Andrés (Province of Tucumán)
According to the daily La Gaceta, of October 29, a certain Señor Roberto Capdevila was driving home on the previous evening when, on National Highway No. 9, he beheld a luminous red object suspended above the side of the road. He estimated that it was at about 60 metres from the ground and about 150 metres distant from his car, and he had under observation for about four minutes. He described the object as looking "like half an orange". It eventually disappeared slowly towards the south.

FLYING SAUCERS ON THE MOON: The following is quoted from an incredible account that saucer researcher Guy J. Cyc, S.M., has circulated to SAUCER NEWS and a number of newspapers.

"On Oct. 29th and Nov. 27th, 1963, Dr. James C. Greenacre and at least four other astronomers at Flagstaff, Arizona, clearly observed on or near the moon 31 'spots,' which turned out to be huge spaceships. After much published breath-to-witness and especially the Air Force, he finally published the details. At a time, these 31 craft were gigantic, ranging in size from about 1,000 feet across to three miles. Yet, from the observers' words, and sketches, it is obvious that at least some of these ships were moving while they were being watched. They were symmetrical and of various colors, which at times were brilliant. These circular, cylindrical, diamond-shaped and U-shaped 'spots' are grouped into five different geometrical formations and oval, two circles, and two double-test-tube patterns, one of which lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes.

"And that's not all between these 'spots' there were 'tiny dots.'

The expression, of course, is very misleading, for these so-called 'dots' had to be at least 500 feet across since they were discernible. They were white, and they had the larger ones which at times were ruby in color. Dr. Greenacre said that the display reminded him of one of our own man-made controlled set of electric lights going on and off according to an intelligently planned rhythm. Yes, in spite of his well-known adamant former skepticism in regard to reports of changes on the lunar surface, he had enough honesty and courage to acknowledge that this constant show on the moon consisted of a moon sign made up of red and white lights 'chasing each other' across it.

"A few scientists had queried that these phenomena were not clouds of any kind...."

DISC SUBMERGED IN BRAZILIAN RIVER

(Continued from Page One)

ely. If the disc sank through the water had in turn the mud as the boiling up
of water and then mud seem to indicate,
it may have proceeded through the muddy river bed to solid rock underneath.

In order to fully assess the meaning
of this incident which is pretty well established as having occurred, we must
take into consideration all of the factors.

Although time detectors were used in
the Brazilian equivalent of the Civil Engineers attempted finding a landing
site, reports do not give us any trace
of any kind, not even the location
of the disc.

We must consider the possibility that
the disc, after setting to the bottom,
either proceeded through locomotion of
some sort away from its initial resting
place and is not now in the original spot.
It is, if could be anywhere in that river.
Also, the size indicates that it may have
been manned and if so perhaps repairs
could be effected under water and escape from the river and the mud accomplished during the night hours, at some

spot more isolated than where it originally sank.

UFOs of various types have been seen
going into and coming out of the water
so we must not assume that this particular disc is necessarily trapped even
though it is a tempting assumption to
make. Time will tell and it may be that
the disc will be pulled out of the river
eventually. It may be, too, that other
UFOs have already come to the disc's
aid and have otherwise salvaged it.

The only similar incident we have logged in APRO files is the incident which
took place off the coast of Venezuela on
the 13th of December 1958. A Swedish
ship wired the harbor control at La Guaira saying that a strange, cone-shaped object was falling vertically into the sea.
That it was very brilliant and gave off
"strange glares." The time was 9:50 p.
m. and the object was seen by the Captain and several of the crew. When the
object hit the water an explosion was
heard, then the sea where the object fell
became brilliantly colored. After the colors subsided the sea became very disturbed with a "boiling motion," which continued for some time.

It is not known whether or not the object was in trouble in this incident but
there is a similarly between the foregoing sighting and the disc which fell
into the Peropava River.

On the 31st of October 1958, Rute de
Souza, 33-year-old daughter of Elidia de
Souza who live near Igarape, Brazil, heard
a strange and increasing roar and on
looking to see where it came from, was
terrified to observe a silvery object coming from the sky. The object was a disc
object soared over her house, then above
her, struck a palm tree near the top and
began to "writhe" and struggle in the
air above the river. Then it fell into the
Peropava River near the opposite shore.

Rute began to run to her house to tell
her Mother, and met her Mother coming
out. Mrs. de Douza had also heard the
roar and ran to investigate. Shortly Raul
de Soura, Rute's uncle, came upon the
scene. He, too, had heard the roar where
he was working about 500 feet from the
house. All three stood in amazement as
they watched the water "boil up" in the
spot where the disc had fallen. The water
continued to surge up, followed by an
eruption of muddy water and then mud.

On the opposite shore of the river fishermen including Japanese Tetsuo Yoshigawa had witnessed the event and it was
from their testimony that the local reporters obtained sufficient description
that led to the estimation of size of the
object—about 25 feet in diameter. All
described the disc as like polished aluminum and shaped like a "wash basin."

The object appeared to be at about 20
feet altitude when it hit the tree. It was
in level flight until that time and after
it struck it began its gyrations which led
to the conclusion of the witnesses that it
was experiencing trouble of some sort.

During the ensuing weeks, divers of
various sorts began to attempt a salvage
operation. At first, divers using only face
masks tried but failed, to be followed by
Scuba divers and eventually a professional deep sea diver with full diving
suit and air compressor came to attempt
to locate the disc but according to their
report, nothing had been found out. All the divers coming to the attempt at the bottom of the river. The Peropava is 12 feet deep at the point where the disc sank and has a muddy bottom
comprised of about 10 feet of mud and

A BRAZILIAN MYSTERY

The following account is taken from the A.P.R.O. BULLETIN for January, 1964, published from 4145 E. Desert Place, Tucson, Arizona U.S.A. and is reprinted by permission. The FLYING SAUCER REVIEW's latest information is that because of the difficult conditions the search has had to be abandoned.

ON October 31, 1953, Rute de Souza, 8-year-old daughter of Elida de Souza who live near Itajai, heard a strange and inexplainable roar and on looking to see where it came from, was terrified to observe a silvery object coming toward the river near her house. The object soared over her house, then above her, sinking a palm tree near the top and began to "write" and struggle in the air above the river. Then it fell into the Perpava River near the opposite shore.

During the ensuing weeks, divers of various sorts attempted to recover the disc. Professional deep sea diver with full diving suit and air compressor came to attempt to locate the disc. At last report, nothing had been found and all the divers complained of the happening effect of the mud at the bottom of the point of the river where the disc sank and has a muddy bottom compared of about 15 feet of mud and clay. If the disc sank through the water and in turn the mud as the boiling up of water and then through the muddy river bed to solid rock underneath.

In order to fully assess the meaning of this incident which is pretty well established as having occurred, we must take into consideration all the factors. Although mine does not represent the Brazilian equivalent of the Civil Engineers attempted finding and salvaging the disc, it does not indicate any success of any kind, not even the location of the disc.

We must consider the possibility that the disc, after settling to the bottom, either proceeded through locomotion of some sort away from its initial resting place and is not now in the original spot. If so, it could be anywhere in that river. Also, the size indicates that it may have been rumored and if so perhaps remains could be affected under water and escape from the river and the accomplished during the night hours, at some more isolated than where it originally sank.

Argentina

Andes

The Tucuman Clarin of October 25, 1963, reported the highly mysterious affair of the three-surveyed Hotel Termas, a summer-season resort in the foothills of the Andes, which, so it seems, was totally destroyed at 6:05 a.m. after previously. Some rumors said it had been hit by an avalanche, while others blamed a huge meteorite or aerolite.

All that is known is that residents of the neighbourhood of Malaigue were awakened by a tremendous detonation. Workers at the nearby Ethel Mine confirmed this, and added that the explosion was accompanied by a vast bluish light that lit up the whole sky over the area of the hotel.

CODONI tried to investigate, but the only explanations that they could extract from the local Gendarmerie Headquarters, and from the Airport Director, was that a meteorite had fallen. (Andes, 69° 58' S, 69° 50' W. The hotel lay at approximately 38° 30' S, 69° W, not far from the Cerro Overo Peak which is 15,700 feet high.)

UFO Observed From Home

Mary C. Kimball of Dover-Foxcroft, Maine (APRO member) saw a bright starlike object while looking out a window of her home on the night of October 1965. After the first few moments, the UFO moved from its original path in the sky toward her vantage point, passed over her house and out of view.

The UFO was of an undefined shape but was described as a bright one on the upward part and gray in color underneath. The witness felt that she had seen what possibly resembled windows. It made no noise during its passage, the time of which was about 11:00 p.m.

Hunters and residents of Arkansas
County, Ark., observed a strange-shaped
UFO between 4:30 and 5:00 a. m. on
October 1, 1963. As viewed from widely
separated spots the object was described
as shaped like a "question mark," a cylinder with a shaft projecting downward"
and a "boomerang".

Seeing conditions were good as the
sky was cloudless. After appearing southeast of Dewitt, it hovered for several
minutes and then sped away.

Monte Maiz, Argentina

Monte Maiz (Province of Córdoba)
FLYING SAUCER REVIEW for January-February
1964 gave a brief outline of the case of the 47-year-
old Argentine truck driver, Eugenio Douglas, who
had an alarming encounter with gigantic UFO
entities. Many more details of the affair have since
come to light, and we now appreciate the full
case I am sure that readers will want to have
everything relevant recorded.

It was 2:50 a.m. on October 12, when Señor
Douglas was taking a load of coal along the road
between Monte Maiz and Isla Verde, bound for
his home town of Venado Tuerto. The Province of
Entre Rios is subject to violent rainstorms, and
when, at a point about 8 km. beyond Monte Maiz,
he was suddenly enveloped by a powerful light,
he thought it might be some vehicle with full head-
lights, but soon perceived that there was only one
beam.

He now felt a burning and prickling sensation on
his face, as though from "fiery needles". An
intense heat accompanied the approaching beam
of light, and it seemed that the inside of his
eyeballs were burning. He could, half fainting,
over the wheel, and his lorry was in the ditch.

Climbing out a few moments later, dazed but
otherwise unhurt, he perceived that the source of
the blinding light was an oval or round object
which hovered the road. He could make no estimate
of its size, but it appeared to be at least 30 ft. high.

The pouring rain hampered his vision to some
extent, but what now follows is quite clear and
indeed.

Suddenly another light, less blinding, appeared
at the side of the object. It was a door opening,
and from it three emerged three enormous beings
whom he described as "robots". Their height was
perhaps 2.50 meters, or even more.

Their clothing, of a nature and appearance
which he was unable to describe, seemed to be
"stuck to their bodies". On their heads were
helmets, from which emerged short antennae. Like those of a snail. (Douglas has no
recollection of the exact details of these features,
but feels that they cannot have been too accurate,
as, for although he felt fear, he emphasizes that
he felt no revulsion whatever.)

Seeing him the beings held his truck, the entities
shone a beam of red light at him. Or rather, as he

described it, it was not so much one beam of red
light as many red lights, of tremendous power,
which seemed to irradiate his skin as they struck
him. The beams were burning him, and in his
confusion and terror he drew his revolver and
fired three or four shots at them, then fell in panic
back down the road to Monte Maiz, still feeling
himself pursued by the burning red light.

When he had first left the burning and prickling
in his face and eyeballs while still in the truck, he
had tried to shield himself with his poncho, and as
he fled down the road he now tried to wrap his
head as best he could in the blanket. Having gone
some distance, he looked back, and saw that the
creatures were going back into the machine, the
series of drives at him on the road, and at each drive
he again left the burning and prickling in his body.

At the very moment while this was happening, a
number of residents of Monte Maiz were taking
part in a vigil beside the body of a Señor Ribas
who had died that day. Suddenly they all noticed
that both the lights in the rooms and candles in the
funerary chamber were changing color, At first
they became a bright red, changing then to green,
and finally, began to give off an asphyxiating gas,
which forced them to rush out of the house.

Arriving on the street outside, they at once beheld
the strange spectacle of the truck driven by Señor
Douglas running madly towards them. Waving a
revolver in the air and with his other hand going
out of breath and exhausted, he was uttering
piercing cries for help.

The house where the wake was in progress was
on the outskirts of Monte Maiz, and close by was
the beginning of the street lamps, marking the
who had just registered a strange light, a bright
red light in the sky and saw the same changes
taking place in the street lamp, which turned red,
then green, and began to give off the same inexplicable gas.

By now there were many people who were
witnesses, all this. For example, there was a
family of the name of Sosa, who were among
those who saw the truck drive with its lights
covered with mud and holding his poncho, was
running wildly round and round one of the lamp
standards.

All these people, with the Ribas family, and a number of participants in the wake, now accompanied Douglas to the Police Station, where
he was at once interrogated and examined. Other
witnesses also told what they had observed with
the street lamps and the candles, and the Police
realized that this story was entirely true, because,
the very time in question, a number of residents of

Robots Terrorize
Truck Driver

Robots . . .
(Continued from Page One)

As Eugene Douglas was driving his commercial truck toward the end of the night of 13th of October, 1963, he also drove toward the most startling event of his life. Suddenly his truck was bathed in brilliant white light and he felt an uncomfortable prickling sensation, much like the feeling of muscles returning after being "asleep". The light was from a disc-shaped object about 25 feet in diameter which hovered over the road.

The companion to the light and the prickling sensation caused him to lose control of the vehicle and the truck went into the ditch at the side of the road.

Douglas got out of his truck and by that time the disc had landed on the roadway and coming toward him were three "indescribable beings". Douglas later referred to as "robots". Drawing a revolver which he habitually carried to ward off possible hijackers, Douglas fired four shots point-blank at the approaching beings, then turned and ran toward Monte Maria, a fast as his feet would take him. Then he turned around and looked at the "beings" and saw that they were going toward the object in the road which took off and in the space of a few seconds was pursuing him. Douglas tried to keep close to trees, etc., for cover but the disc managed three passes over him, and each time it passed over, he felt the heat and prickling sensation again. Then the disc left. He eventually arrived at Monte Maria where he reported his experience to the police.

The police at Monte Maria later told the Agora paper, "Accion" that Douglas was hysterical but in other respects all right when he came rushing in to tell his story. A physician who examined Douglas said that he burns on Douglas' marks were wells. It was attributed to the light from the disc.

Examination of the ground where the
(See Robots—Page 2)

object was reported to have landed yielded nothing but police said they expected nothing for the incident had taken place during a rain storm which had continued for some time after the event and therefore any marks would have been washed out.

On the day after the Douglas encounter with the robots, several county people who had been attending a burial in the area where Douglas saw the beings, told police they had spotted a brilliantly lit disc-shaped object flying through the skies the night before. The time coincided with the time of the Douglas encounter.

In the fall of 1962 an Argentina ranch woman was hospitalized for hysteria after seeing robot-like creatures near her ranch. The Douglas incident seems to correlate generally with that of the woman's experience a year earlier.

they could stay there, they were afraid
to leave because of the menaces hover-
ing outside, so Senora de Moreno instruct-
ed all to be as quiet as possible.

After forty minutes of this discomfort
and fear, the witnesses, who had watched
the proceedings outside all the time, saw
the object at the railroad tracks elevate
and move away, followed by the discs
which surrounded he house. Just before
taking off, the light on the two closest
discs went out and they followed the
others off in the direction of the neigh-
boring farms. Where the two closest discs
had hovered there remained a misty
smoke-like deposit for several minutes.

Several hours later a reporter for
"Clarín", a newspaper at Cordoba Prov-
ince, also providing information for
France Press Service, visited the de Mo-
renos. He later reported that the strong
sulphur smell was still apparent both
around and inside the de Moreno house
and the inside of the house was still suf-
focatingly hot when he arrived there.

Corroboration

Corroboration of the presence of the
discs in the area between 9:30 and 10:20
was furnished by Francisco Tropuano,
who, not knowing of the de Moreno in-
cident, had reported seeing a formation
or "squadron" of lighted disc-like shapes
moving through the sky at about 10:15
p. m. when the de Morenos said the discs
were leaving their area.

The presence of the heat and odor
were testimony together with the Tro-
puano testimony corroborating the discs
claimed they left, seem to indicate that
this incident is true, especially in view
of the good reputation for integrity and
honesty of the de Moreno family.

At 9:20 p. m. on the 21st of October,
Senor Antonio de Moreno was an employ-
ee at his ranch near Tranca, Argentina, by
a 13-year-old employee who told him
there had apparently been an accident on
the railroad tracks about a half mile dis-
tant as there was a lot of light and peo-
ple moving around at that location.

De Moreno, 72, wakened Senora Teresa
Kaires de Moreno, 63, and they both
looked out the window. Over the railroad
track just a few feet in the air there hov-

projecting light to the ground where the
de Morenon saw "people" walking to and

nora de Moreno then spotted another
similar object very close to the house.
She could see a dome-shaped structure,
about 23 feet in diameter, as well as
windows or ports around the circumfer-
ence of the object. This object also was
but a few feet off the ground. The Se-
nora got a flashlight and shone it toward
the disc, whereupon it shot a bright-white
tubular beam of light at the house. Al-
though she slayed fairly calm through-
out the whole episode, Senora de Moreno,
not knowing the meaning of the incident,
rounded up the children in the ranch
house, with the help of her sister, and
hid them. Then the de Morenos began
a systematic check of all the windows
and shortly discovered that there were
five discs near the house—three stayed
about 210-220 feet distant, and two, ex-
cluding the nearest one which she saw
first, were within only a few feet. One
shone the white tubular light at the
house, the other a reddish-violet tubular
light.

House Heated Up Like Oven

Shortly after the lights struck the
house, the inside of the house began to
heat up until it was "like an oven" and
there was a strong smell of sulphur in
the air. Although the heat became so
intense that the occupants didn't think
