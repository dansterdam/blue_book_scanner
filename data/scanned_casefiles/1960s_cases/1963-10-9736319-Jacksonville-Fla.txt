FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 65

The incident happened on a very isolated farm belonging to the Davidson family in Jacksonville, Florida. There were 6-7 people in the house, the evening of January 3, 1963, when they started watching something in the sky. There were four children, ranging in age from 5 to 12 years old. The house is about 25 miles from the city of Jacksonville. A 13-year-old servant girl (a Negro) was the first to see it. She ran into the house and called all the others out to see it. They all witnessed the object.

They said it was round, about 40-50 feet in diameter, and aluminum-colored. It hovered over their field for about 10 minutes, then shot straight up out of sight. The object gave off a red glow on the way up. Husband and wife examined the field the next day, and found four circular indentations about 10 feet apart. The object did not come down or land, but seemed to lift straight off the ground.

The family was greatly disturbed and upset about the incident. The husband, Joe Davidson, who is about 45-50 years old, as is his wife Dora, talked it over very carefully with his wife and children. They are all very reliable and creditable people. The whole family is well known in this area and have an excellent reputation. The husband, who is a tenant farmer on a peanut farm, seems to be a very intelligent man.

The Moreno family, living only a mile from the Davidson farm, also saw the object that same evening. They confirmed the Davidson's story. Several other people in the area also reported seeing the object.

Next day, a police inspector was sent from Jacksonville to investigate, and he seemed satisfied with the report. He said these people were of good reputation and that he could find no evidence of hoax or fabrication.

San Andreas, Calif., Jan 23, 1966

A retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Colonel, La Gasta, of Ukiah, Calif., reported that while driving along California Highway No. 9, he beheld a luminous red object suspended about 1000 feet above the ground. It remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then took off at a high rate of speed towards the south.

FLYING SAUCERS ON THE MOON: The following is quoted from an article in the "Information Only", Volume 1, No. 7, March, 1965.

"Last for over sixty years without being sighted again." On Oct. 29th and Nov. 27th, 1954, 8:30 p.m., Dr. James E. McDonald, professor in the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Arizona, Tucson, saw two brilliant circular, lenticular, diamond-shaped and U-shaped objects hovering and maneuvering across the sky for over three miles. They performed incredible formations and feats across the sky at a distance of about 500 feet. They were visible for about 10-15 minutes. These circular, elliptical, diamond-shaped and U-shaped craft were silent and made no sound and appeared to be under intelligent control. They were almost 700 feet in diameter, clearly visible, and occasionally seemed to merge in and out of each other. At times they left a trail of light and sparks behind them, and at times they were absolutely silent as they moved. 

"And that's not all between these 'spats' there were missilings for these so-called "spars" or "spats" were either going to at least 500 feet and since they were discernible, They went back and forth across the sky. I saw a great metallic lights going on and off according to an initial pattern and just blotting out the stars behind them. There was an utter absence of noise or sound, and of course, this is the main thing that can be deduced from a sight like this. These craftsmen behaved in ways which astonished me in their technical features capability of advanced maneuvers, speed, and courage to acknowledge that this is strange and not-according-to a normal pattern of aviation. I was convinced that I was witnessing beyond any shadow of a doubt a manifestation - and a rather awesome one - of unidentified flying objects."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document titled "A BRAZILIAN MYSTERY" that provides an account of an incident that occurred on October 31, 1963 in Rue de Santos, Brazil involving a river, a house, and some unexplained observations.

A BRAZILIAN MYSTERY

The following account is taken from the A.P.R.O. BULLETIN for January, 1964, published by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, U.S.A., and is reprinted by permission. The information is that because of the difficult conditions the search has had to be abandoned.

On October 31, 1963, Rua de Santos, 8-year-old Elias de Sousa, who live near the river bank, heard a strange noise and went down to the riverside to investigate. He saw water bubbling up from the bottom of the river. The water rose to the level of the bank and then subsided, leaving many fish dead at the point where the disturbance had occurred. The eldest son-in-law of the owner of the house, who was nearby, also witnessed the occurrence.

About half an hour later, Mr. de Sousa heard the roar again and ran to investigate. He saw a portion of the river about 300 feet from the house. All three members of the family watched this phenomenon, which appeared to them like a "wash basin." The object remained at the surface of the water for about 15 minutes, then submerged. As it did so, a great quantity of muddy water and fish mud was displaced.

After this incident, the family members became convinced that something unusual had occurred and decided to report their observations to the authorities. In the meantime, they made preparations to salvage some of the dead fish and tend to the sick animals. In the event and it was from looking at what the investigators discovered later, that the object was metallic and disc-shaped, measuring about 50 feet in diameter. It was also apparently partly submerged in the mud. There were marks and indentations on the ground around where the object had been resting, suggesting that it weighed a considerable amount.

We must consider the possibility that this disc may have been a Brazilian equivalent of the "flying saucer" type of aircraft, both in construction and in the maneuvering ability it displayed. The location and terrain were very suitable for a landing or hovering flight, and if so, it is not inconceivable that repairs or adjustments were being made, and if so, perhaps supplies could be obtained from the nearby town.

UFOs of various types have been reported in the area and it may be that this incident is related to other sightings. It is possible that the craft was damaged or disabled in some way and had to rest there to effect repairs. The only similar incident is the Ubatuba case of 1957, a Swedish ship sank near the location in 1956. We can only speculate as to the purpose of the visit and the identity of the occupants. But the fact remains that the phenomena was observed by competent and reliable witnesses and the indications are that it was a metallic disc-shaped craft of unknown origin.

The observation was reported at 8:35 p.m., 10/15/63 when the observer's attention was attract
ed to a light in the sky. The object was observed for about 3 minutes and then disappeared. The observer described the object as being round, brilliant white in color and approximately the size of a basketball. The object was traveling at a rapid rate of speed and then suddenly came to a dead stop and hovered for about a minute. It then accelerated and disappeared from sight.

The text states that on October 23, 1963, the Tucuman Observer reported a "highly mysterious affair" of three objects that were observed high in the sky over Tucuman, Argentina. The objects were described as being totally destroyed at 6:35 a.m. after being hit by avalanches. Residents of Malagueno were awakened by the disturbance and confirmed the incident. The report indicates that a restricted area was established, and the Air Force provided a statement on the event.

UFO Observed From Home
Mrs. G. Kimball of Dover-Foxcroft, Maine (APRO member) saw a bright star-like object while looking out the window of her home on the night of October 9, 1963. After observing it for some moments, the UFO moved from the original position up in the sky toward the east and disappeared. The UFO was of an undefined shape and was described as being of a bright and gray color underneath. The witness felt that she had seen what would normally resemble a window. It made no noise and was visible for approximately 5 minutes, which was about 11:00 p.m.

Odd Shaped Object
Seen in Arkansas
The following was observed by witnesses in Arkansas on 1 April 1963. As viewed from the ground, the object was described as a "disc" with a skirt projecting downward and "boomerang shaped". The witnesses stated the object was first observed at an estimated elevation of 30 degrees above the horizon. The object hovered for several minutes and then sped away.

On the day after the Douglas encounter with the Caoma, another incident occurred in Argentina in which police said they had spotted a brilliantly lit object near the ground. Flying machines like this one had been seen at the time of the Douglas encounter.

About the end of 1962 an Argentine woman was hospitalized for hysteria after seeing creatures near her home, similar in some ways to the beings seen in the Douglas incident a year earlier.

FAMILY BESEIGED BY DISCS
Besieged - (continued from Page One) 
According to the report, a family in Tioga, Florida, was forced to leave their home because of the machines hovering above an area near their home for an extended period.

After forty minutes of this discomfort and fear, the witnesses, who had contacted authorities, reported that the object at the railroad tracks about a mile away suddenly vanished. The objects that had been hovering over the home also departed shortly thereafter. 

The family went out and they followed the lights off in the distance as they departed their home. After returning home, the house and yard were saturated with a strong sulphurous odor, providing information for onsite physical services. The presence and departure of the discs was corroborated by a number of other people in the area between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m. on the night of the incident, had reported seeing a formation of lights in the sky that then departed. The objects were reported to be leaving their area.

The presence of their heat and odor, this corroborated man's testimony concerning the discs leaving, and showed that the time the incident took place as true, especially as far as the size and reputation for honesty of the family involved.
