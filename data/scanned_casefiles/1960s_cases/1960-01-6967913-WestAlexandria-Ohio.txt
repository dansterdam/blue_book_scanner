To Whom it May Concern:

I awoke this morning at 6:00 and looked out the window and saw an extremely bright light in the S. E. At first I thought it was a star but after watching it for a while I noticed it moved around. I don't believe in those flying saucer stories but there must be some explanation. The object appeared to be apprx. 130 S. of compass N (just a cheap compass) at apx 2 o'clock. Last seen at apx 6:35.
