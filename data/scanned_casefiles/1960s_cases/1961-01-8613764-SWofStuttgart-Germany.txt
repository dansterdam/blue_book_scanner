7. SOURCE: Military

8. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 min

9. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Top unit was rectangular and reflected a bright orange-yellow color. Trailing or a bright exhaust that was coming from a round shaped object became at first enough to plainly discern the separation. Point high pitched whistle heard before object passed Zenith and then died out after passage.

11. COMMENTS: Attempted to indicate that the color of a "fireball" is consistent as to shade. Fireballs very in color and shape. The sighting lasted just less that 3 min, yet only one report was made. The information is very limited and general, precluding a valid conclusion.

12. CONCLUSIONS: ☐ Was Balloon ☐ Probably Balloon ☐ Possibly Balloon ☐ Was Aircraft ☐ Probably Aircraft ☐ Possibly Aircraft ☐ Was Astronomical ☐ Probably Astronomical ☐ Possibly Astronomical ☐ Other ☒ Insufficient Data for Evaluation ☐ Unknown

1. The following is the report of an UFO submitted to the USAF
Air Division Detox, 7th Army, Stuttgart, Germany, 1300 & Jan 61.

Shape of top unit was rectangular in reflected a bright orange
yellow color similar to a rocket exhaust that was coming from a round
shaped object beneath it. For enough to plainly discern the mechanical
trend high pitched whistle heard before object reached the Zenith and
then died out after passage. Size not known as nothing of altitude
for comparison is available. It was much larger than ever seen before
in passage. Cloud cover was such that objects would have been less
than 12000H high at time of observation. Course was south west to
North East. The first observed object and called attention of observer to the object. Length was recorded about 600 south of
observer. Object moved in a straight flight path. No returnig
constantly moved through a 900 flat trajectory back and forth. After
objects reached 45° past Zenith toward North East, bright orange flare
seemed to explode from the fire ball or meteorite object.

So catch fire starting at tip vertically moving toward North. Fire
was more red than fire ball flames. At this boundary progressd the
ball and rectangular started to separate rapidly. The ball disappeared
from view point lower at about 300 above the horizon while the second was still visible burning and breaking into many flaming pieces.
Estimate that the whole sighting took place within three minutes.

Object was observed from the ground outside by optical sides. Time
of observation 1740-1743. Sky condition at 1800: can soon reached
100% overcast. (An expert at nearby Kelterhofen (airfield) sighting
was a purely beneath clouds as object did not disappear and was passing through clouds observed where after could be seen. Location of sighting was Ehingerstrasse, ... of Stuttgart, Germany, 480 30' North
900 00' East by 90 & Allied Fs. Johnstone, USAFSS(P), 1st Lt, Provost Marshal Office, Bldg 6, Patch Barracks, Patch Hill: 1179.
