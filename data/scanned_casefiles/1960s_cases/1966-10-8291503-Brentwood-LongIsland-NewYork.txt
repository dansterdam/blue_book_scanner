11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer saw a stationary object in the west. The object remained stationary. A large cloud moved in a bright blue-white light was noted. It either shone a spotlight down on the object or the bright light was emerging from the object. The object speeded off at a very fast rate of speed. The witness said that he took pictures to the Air Force for their investigation but that he only saw the one object, but in the picture there was another object that he could not explain. The witness took the pictures, but there was no physical evidence received.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text describing some observations about the lateral variations in the path and images of stars.

CONTENTS:
The lateral variations in the path match exactly on all four tracks they are clearly the images of stars, formed as the camera was slowly panned past them. The stars are the three "well" stars of Orion, followed by something, but succeeded only in recording errant background material. There is no evidence of any intentional fraud.

I Saw
Space
Spectacle
Over LI
BY LEONARD VICTOR
Rewritten and photographed
from an undisclosed LOF o
observer's account.
And although I did not
really see the close detail I
should have liked to, I did
obtain three clear shots of
the UFO I was photographIng. They show some of
the mysterious aerial objects
that have been seen in the
area in the last few days.
At the same time I was
watching and photographing
the UFO, a friend who
drives a jeep stationed on a
hill overlooking the area was
also watching and photographing the same objects
and other sightings in the
eastern sky. But strange as
it may seem to some, he's
not going to believe it.
You see, what I observed and
photographed was so close
and so brilliant that the
"UFO's Are Coming" theories
are no longer theories.
They are face.
WHAT I first saw was a
brilliant white object, much
brighter than the surrounding stars and at least ten
times their size at the
same time.
It was brilliantly luminous, and at the same time
the whole shape was clear
in the color of an old silver
dollar.

Koreans Give LBJ A Wild Reception 

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - President Johnson was welcomed today by an enthusiastic throng of 50,000 Koreans who broke down metal fences around American Embassy and surged forward with shouts and cheers to get their first glimpse of the visiting U.S. leader.

Shouts turned into thunderous applause as Johnson emerged from his car in the City Square. The President responded by waving and blowing kisses to the flag-waving throng. Once the tumultuous crowd began to subside, buses carrying the President's party pushed slowly through the crush of people toward a reviewing stand.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A sharp-looking pictures of the crashed UFO in the Longsland UFO.

The sharper eye could tell that the bright oval was not a star or a place. It was stationary and was not travelling but hovere. The shap pictures seem to show now that it was some kind of odd-shaped craft, like an elliptical oval. The sharper pictures reveal more details and show that it was a structured craft of some kind and artificial in design. The Longsland UFO Report describes the craft as elliptical in shape and shiny. 

As it passed me. I think of be a matter of minutes and seconds. It seemed to be moving at a fast rate of speed, perhaps 600 mph or more, and appeared to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. It made no sound that I could hear. I think what I saw could best be described as a disc-shaped craft, circular in nature, with a slight curvature on the top and bottom. The color seemed to be metallic or aluminum in nature, and it reflected the sun's rays in such a way that it appeared to almost glow.

Dad's Efforts Fail, 2 Children Die

The fire was said to have started in the basement of the home of Thomas Stettner, 25, of East Stroudsburg. Stettner, with his wife Margaret, 23, tried desperately to reach their children - Alan, 4, and Marjorie, 2 - who were upstairs, but the flames drove them back.

The image contains a set of four photographs, which appear to be part of a UFO report document. The photographs show different views of what is described as a sighted object, including views in the western sky, the southern sky, and two views in the eastern sky.

The text in the document describes the witness's sighting, including details about the object's appearance, movement, and comparison to an aircraft. The text also mentions that the witness took photographs of the object "as best humanly possible".

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 Oct. 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As I was driving westward on the Long Island Expwy. I noticed a colored object stationary in the western sky. The initial sight was about 2230 EDT, and involved a sighting of an oval object. It nearly caused me to have an accident as I could not believe my eyes. The object appeared to be bluish-green and also changed color a little. It just hovered there in the sky, no sound, nor any sign of propulsion. Moments after the cloud covered the object I stepped on the brake, and the object was seen again after the cloud covered it. It suddenly proceeded forward at an extremely fast rate of speed. 

The pictures showed things that the witness claimed he did not see at the time. He said at the beginning was a very long oval object. The apparent light shining down from the object, nor the wall light that appeared on the photographs.

Two last two pictures were taken:
object as it traveled at a very high rate of speed off into the east.

Photos: Taken holding camera as most humanly possible
2 in the western sky
3 in the southern sky  
1 in the eastern sky for 2 second exposure
1 in the eastern sky for 5 second exposure

In about four seconds the object covered approximately 40 degrees. 

Object could have compared with the Goodyear blimp, but the fast rate of speed at the end of the flight path discounted this conclusion by witnesses. After the object came from behind the cloud it was moving so fast toward the east; then it seemed to be slowly climbing as it went toward the horizon. Also an aircraft was spotted at the bottom could have been the object viewed but again the high rate of descent shown in the pictures as a possible explanation.

Other witnesses reported different colors visible but ungraded on speed and flight path of the unknown.
