11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer saw a stationary object in the western sky that was yellow in color. The object was oval in shape and remained stationary. A large cloud moved in front of this object. Yemans after the cloud covered the object a bright blue-white light was noted proceeding toward the east. At first the speed was compared with that of an aircraft. But toward the end of the sighting it suddenly speeded off at a very fast rate of speed. Photos were taken of the object. Observer said that he would sent the pictures to the Air Force for their investigation. Personal contact with the witness was made. He stated that he only saw the one object, but in the later pictures he could not explain the additional three objects. When the witness took the pictures he only saw one object.

COMMENTS:

The lateral variations in the path match exactly on all four tracks: they are clearly the images of stars, formed as the camera was slowly panned past them. The stars are the three "belt" stars of Orion, followed by the star Rigel. It seems that was trying to photograph something, but succeeded only in recording irrelevant background material. There is no evidence of an intentional fraud.

'I Photo
Space
Spectacle
Over 11
By LEONARD VICTOR

I saw and photographed a UFO - an unidentified flying object - in North Brentwood late Saturday night.

And although I did not see them, the final time of exposure I took clearly showed three contrails streaks of light in formation, east of the UFO I was photographing. They may have been three more of the mysterious aerial objects that have been roaming Long Island's skies in recent days.

At the same time I was visually and photographically tracking the UFO, Press Photo Staff were also receiving the same sighting in Smithtown and Centerport. I suspect a lot of people aren't going to believe it, but what I witnessed has nothing to do with the so-called "UFO's Are Serious Business" that starts today on page 15 of The Press.

WHAT I first saw was a motionless object, much brighter and at least ten times as large as any planet or star in the sky that I could see at the same time.

It was brilliantly luminous and its pale-yellow shade was close to the color of the ends of your classic field telephone book.

Caption for first image: A closeup of the UFO, with what may be the edge of a cloud at left veiling the outline.

Flying Convict
Took Off Again
WINNIPEG (UPI) - Kenneth Leishman, the "flying
convict," flew the coop
again last night - but only
for 3 1/2 hours.
Leishman, who is awaiting trial in the $83,000 gold
bullion robbery from Winnipeg International Airport
last March, broke out of
Jail but was recaptured at
a suburban parking lot.

Federal authorities conferred with Hentel yesterday on the probe, which is
expected to dig into activities of Minutemen, an extreme right wing, secretive
nationalist organization
dedicated to militantly combatting "left wing and liberal groups."

The three camps, which
Hentel refused to identify,
reputedly are training centers for left wing groups.
Hentel said yesterday's arrests of 20 men headed off
armed attacks on the camps.

The men, including six
from Queens, six from Nassau and four from Suffolk,
were to be arranged today
in Kew Gardens Criminal
Court.

AS A security measure,
the 20 were jailed in wide
by scattered police precincts.

The extraordinary precaution was taken, authorities explained, to prevent
the prisoners from exchanging information during the night.

The charges, although
not necessarily against all
of the men, included possession of dangerous weapons, conspiracy to commit arson, and unlawful assembly.

The 20 were seized in a
series of raids beginning
at 5 a.m. yesterday by 110
law enforcement officers
who swept through
Queens, Nassau, Suffolk,
Brooklyn, the Bronx and
two upstate areas.

THROUGHOUT the day
truckloads of weapons,
ammunition and equipment rolled up to Hentel's
office in Kew Gardens.
Hentel described the ar-

senal seizure as "the biggest haul of weapons and
destructive material ever
recovered by an agency in
the memory of veteran police officers."

Police said the weapons
and ammo were recovered
from homes, dug up from
yards and wooded areas
and located in several undisclosed places.

Police said that when
they arrested Jack Lynn
Boyce, 10, at his farmhouse
home in Katonah, in West-

chester, officers found so
many weapons that a truck
was filled. They said the
arsenal included 10 machine guns and a number
of bazookas.

A newsman at the scene
said the Minutemen flag -
a duplicate of the Betsy
Ross version with 13 stars
in a circle - was flying atop
the house.

Hentel said the investigation began last January
when New York City police
received confidential information. Several individuals
were put under close surveillance, "secret meetings"
were infiltrated by undercover agents, codes were
broken and hidden cameras
and other spy-type devices
were used, according to
Hentel.

The prosecutor said yesterday's raids were the result of massive coordination between various county police and detectives,
laboratory and tech squad
specialists and state troopers. "Operation Minutemen" was coordinated at
the top by New York City
Chief Inspector Sanford Garelik and Chief
of Detectives Frederick
Leahy.

Koreans Give LBJ
A Wild Reception
SEOUL (AP)â€”President Johnson was today welcomed to South Korea today by an estimated two million people who broke down metal fences, swarmed around police and clung to rooftops for their first glimpse of the man hailed in a typical banner as the "Great Texas Giant."

Seoul turned out the big-hearted, friendliest crowd of Johnson's seven-nation tour around the eastern rim of Communist China.

The President responded by popping out of his car with a dozen times to mix with the crowd, tossing, flag-waving throng. Once he climbed down a roadside embankment to a muddy rice paddy to inspect a newly harvested rice. An aide used rice stalks to wipe the soggy gray dirt from Johnson's shoes.

Gaping massed crowds estimated by police at 350,000 in City Hall Square, the President voiced concern for the safety of those who pushed, shoved and trampled each other in an effort to get a better view.

Whatever it was, it was stationary enough so that I was able to get two very sharp-looking pictures of its outline. What my eyes saw was roughly a horizontal oval. The sharper eye of the lens showed a weirder shape with weaker cones of light below and above the object, indicating between the time I took the first and second pictures.

A slim bank of low-hanging cumulus clouds, nudged by the chilling early winds we had late Saturday night, moved in front of the UFO.

WHEN IT reappeared, the object was in motionâ€”from west to eastâ€”and its yellow shade was swiftly disappearing, replaced by a blush-purple color.

As it passed me, it looked as if it was moving on a straight and level course. It seemed to be going no faster than the typical one-motored private planes that I've flown out of Flushing, Zahn's and other Long Island airports.

As it continued eastward, the UFO seemed to be picked up speed. When I passed south of me as I stood on the Long Island Expressway border, the "whatever-it-was" was doing about 20 miles an hour.

BUT AS it got further east, the speed went up dramatically. The last two experiences made out an object many miles away, show a pair of much longer strides than those made when the UFO was close to me. This means a fantastically high-speed of travel.

Actual speed calculations, from examination of the (Turn to Next Page)

Dad's Efforts Fail, 2 Children Die in Fire
A young Massapequa father was critically injured yesterday when he tried to rescue two of his children from the flames that destroyed their home.

His efforts, however, saved the lives of his wife and another child.

When firemen arrived at the home of Thomas Storjohann at 6 Fairfield Road at 6:10 a.m., they found the one-and-a-half story building in flames.

Volunteer fireman Richard Chichester, 23, threw a garbage can through a Storjohann out before the intense heat and flames prevented further rescue work.

Still in the bedroom was Storjohann's 15-month-old son, Michael. Storjohann had collapsed at the foot of his infant son's crib after fighting his way through the blaze to rescue him.

Also in the house was Storjohann's 6-year-old daughter, Margaret, who had locked herself in a closet in an upstairs bedroom in a fruitless flight from the fire.

Two other members of the family, however, were saved. Storjohann's quick-witted wife, Margaret, 25, and his 3-year-old son, Thomas Jr., escaped.

Young Thomas' life was saved when through chance. He had gotten up in the middle of the night, spotted a light in his parents' bed room and climbed into bed with his mother.

When Mrs. Storjohann saw the smoke, she ran from the bedroom and found the boy in flames. She rushed him into the room and carried him through a window.

She tried to get back into the house to save the others, but both doors were blocked. Then she and the firemen officials.

Storjohann was taken to Mid-Island Hospital, Bethpage, where he was reported in serious condition.

More Raids At High

The Long Island house wife's battle to lower prices showed signs of spreading today.

As pickets continue to march outside two groups, two groups hastily formed over the weekendâ€”plan to hold a protest rallies tonight.

Rallies are scheduled for Huntington by Shoppers Against Deception USA and in Hollis by a new affiliate of the Bay Side-Rosedale Paines Civic Group.

The affiliate is led by M-

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As [redacted] was driving westward on the Long Island Expwy he noted a yellow colored object stationary in the western sky. The initial sighting was at about 2310 EDT, and involved a sighting of an oval object. [redacted] stopped at a nearby rest area and tried to take pictures of a stationary object.

[redacted] took two pictures in the western sky before a large cloud moved in front of the object. Moments after the cloud covered the object a bright blue-white light was noted proceeding toward the east. At first the speed was compared with that of an aircraft but towards the end of the sighting it suddenly speeded off at a very fast rate of speed.

The pictures showed things that the witness claimed he did not see. All he saw at the beginning was a yellowish oval object. He could not explain the apparent light shining down from the object, not the wall light pattern that appeared on the photographs. The last two pictures were taken of the object as it traveled at a very high rate of speed off into the east. The last picture was taken at about 2314 EDT.

Photos: Taken holding camera as most humanly possible

2 in the western sky
3 in the southern sky
1 in the eastern sky for 2 second exposure
1 in the eastern sky for 5 second exposure

In about four seconds the object covered approximately 40 degrees in the sky.

Object could have compared with the Goodyear blimp but the fast rate of speed at the end of the flight path discounted this conclusion by the witness. After the object came from behind the cloud it was no bigger than a bright star. The object had a straight and level flight path as it went toward the east, then it seemed to be slowly climbing as it traveled at the high rate of speed. Also an aircraft with some type of light on the bottom could have been the object viewed but again the high rate of speed at discount this as a possible explanation.

Other witnesses reported different colors visible but agreed on the speed and flight path of the unknown.
