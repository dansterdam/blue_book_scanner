This whole episode took place in about forty-five minutes and ended just about dusk. If it were not for the fact that all four of us observed this event, I would hesitate to bring this to your attention. However, the enclosed clippings are what prompted me to write to you relative to the same. Newark Valley is about fifty miles South of/and I must admit the report from there sounds weird, but then, our experience appeared the same to us.

During World War II I was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and all my flying experience was within the Continental limits of the United States. In all that time, never once, night or day, observed anything unusual in the skies. Now, at age 43, I have observed phenomena which are beyond my comprehension, and which tax my sense of reasoning and credulity.

Respectfully,

Inc.

SUMMARY OF PRINTS

Print I.
At first sighting of the dark end of the formation it was not giving off any material. This happened as it neared the cloud formation and the vapor drifted to the North according to my daughter. However, I thought it drifted to the South as it dissipated and we can not agree on the North direction.

Print II.
The vapor trail from the object was a great deal wider than an ordinary jet trail and after Print II had disappeared and should be disregarded in the subsequent prints.

Print III.
New object appears moving from left to right and at arm's length I could cover the object with my two forefingers so this must have been a very large vehicle.

Print IV.
A very short time lapsed as object moved rapidly from left to right and then from right to left back again as shown in the sky.

Print V.
There were no signs of other planes or jet trails in the sky during any of these sightings.

Print VI.
As the object was dividing into two parts shown in closeup, the whole operation was very smooth and absolutely positive in action.

Print VII.
No. 6 Print VI became 4, and subsequently 5 as shown in closeup on Print VII. Object 5 should be more distinctly a pencil-shape and not curved as shown.

Miscellaneous
At Print I the object did not continue to fall but seemed to be suspended and then disappeared into the cloud bank.

At Print IV object shot forward a distance of two inches (approximately) on horizon if measured with ruler held at arm's length.

Dark end of object at very first sighting in Print I definitely appeared to be of material substance and not just a cloud formation.

Distance object traveled from Print III to Print II where it first FORWARD appeared to be about seven inches on a ruler held at arm's length.

Dr. [redacted]
[redacted], New York

Dear Dr. [redacted]:

I am still very much interested in the sighting which you made last April, but I am no closer to a solution than I was before. I write this to remind you that you promised to send the sketches of the sighting that I believe you said your wife made.

You were not certain whether the original sketches still existed, but you indicated that if they did not, you would prevail upon your wife to reproduce them as best she can from memory. I hope that you will be able to favor me with this in the near future. I would like to include these in the case file.

I trust that everything else is well with you and that you are carrying your camera around with you!

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

You will soon fire me because instead of solving unidentities, I appear
to be adding to the. I believe you got a copy of a letter that was sent
to me by _______, Philadelphia, New York, which apparently was never
duly reported to your office. It was officially reported to me, so I guess in a
way that counts as being official. Incidentally, the sighting occurred on
April 1, 1964 at 9:30 P.M., apparently Eastern Standard Time, as the
witness was setting vehicle a mile to the west. If you do not have a
copy of the letter, I will send a copy of my "loose" copy. I think I
think I sent the original on to you.

At any rate, I got around to talking and had a fairly long conversation
with ______. He still has reservations to _______ because he had seen the account of
the investigation in Goshen and seems quite well with other witnesses.
He will send me a copy of his letter which will help me understand
it, of course. Doubling back with the State Dept and half here were deep
into this sighting in all his life. The author gives one air overview,
and comes out in the same way. The problem is that he has a number
of rough a number of points have generated the similar form of ____
(which also marked the several world) and of the facts have essentially
drawn all. The phone conversation was mainly useful in that he gave a
view that the _______ would like to see if it will play afternoon role to be
studied. The typical reaction seems to be to get the facts and ______
stated. Make, which is one of the types he knows. The one or two message
was his wife and two children, aged fourteen and her respectively. There
was a south wind blowing exactly to 14 S. The meeting was in a
place _______ was a large _______ lot. The control, two more or
less _______ to somewhere and talked not to me. The contrails, two ______
came more up quite rapidly. Blows that there are all important so ______
further.

saw a kind of a brief effect of the action, sun. However, if this had been the
case, it should have been the eastern part of the trail that not only flows,
I was at this time that he can so observe it with six-meter binoculars
and ______. He was using or had some kind of a ______. He was originally

can in the movies view a plane like that. But with this city, just

PHYSIOTHER
CORTLAND, N.Y.
May 15, 1964

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Director, Dearborn Observatory
Northeastern University
Chicago, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek

I can appreciate that you probably receive hundreds of letters of this type, but if the information submitted herein assists you in any way in your research of matters of this sort, I am happy to submit it to you.

On April 11, 1964, my wife, two children [redacted], age 10, and [redacted], age 14) and I were having a picnic supper on a hill 1800 feet above sea level, about ten miles Northwest of Homer, New York. It was 6:30 p.m., wind out of the North about 5 miles per hour, and the day was crystal clear with just a few stratus clouds on the Western horizon. At about 6:00 p.m. several jet bombers had left vapor trails up high, traveling from West to East, but these trails quickly disappeared.

As I looked up in the sky a little to the Northwest of us at about 6:30 p.m. there appeared what I thought was a very large jet trail from Northeast to Southwest. It was very white and wide and at the Southwest end there was a break on the trail of about 1 mile. Then a very black spiral formation of what appeared to be smoke appeared about 1 mile long. We remarked that the white trail was unusually wide for a jet trail and apparently the black portion looked dark because of the angulation of the glow of the setting sun behind the Western hill several miles away.

The white vapor trail hung in the sky and gradually drifted to the South, slowly dissipating. Up to this point we were observing what we believed to be a normal situation, except for the abrupt ending of the white trail, the space and the continuation of the black spiral tip.

Approximately ten minutes had now passed and it suddenly occurred to me that the black spiral cloud had slowly moved to the West while the white trail had drifted Southward. Also, the cloud became much darker and we all observed this. At this point I took 6 & 25 binoculars to observe it and was shocked to see wisps of smoke actually streaming out of the black cloud...almost boiling out. It

was now slowly approaching the distant stratus cloud formation silhouetted against the Western hill. Suddenly the black cloud, still retaining its spiral shape, changed from the horizontal position to a vertical position with greater smoke activity and resembled a smoking plane slowly falling from the sky, at the same time assuming a shape not unlike a banana. Then it no longer seemed to be falling, but simply stopped and hung there for two or three minutes and then very slowly seemed to sink into the clouds and was obliterated.
Everyone of us observed this strange phenomenon plainly with the naked eye.

After about three minutes had elapsed while we were all wondering if our eyes had played tricks on us, my daughter suddenly exclaimed "there's another one". It appeared as a horizontal pencil shaped object. It was impossible at that distance to determine the length, but it could have been as large as a submarine. It moved from the left on the horizon to the right. We could not agree as to whether this was the original object or another rendezvousing with the first object, as this second sighting appeared to the left of where the first object became obliterated by the clouds.

As I was observing it with my binoculars, there was a flash of white light from the rear of it and it shot forward with incredible speed for a distance of about five times its length and a suddenly stopped, still maintaining the pencil shape, apparently hovering. My son described the incident as it happened while I watched it with the binoculars. It became thick in the middle and with a cloud of smoke seeming. From it, shot backward as rapidly as it had gone forward about the same distance. Again it hovered and then began to shorten in length until it appeared saucer shaped, fat in the middle.

Then the most incredible part occurred..., from the saucer shape it became almost perfectly round and slowly divided into two parts, one above the other, very much as a single cell does under a microscope. The top object slowly became smaller as it appeared to fade off in the distance, while the second object headed downward at a 45° angle toward the apex, where we had seen the second object disappear. At this point it divided in two again but the bottom object now assumed a vertical pencil shape while the top oval object slowly faded away. We realize the pencil shape could well be a disc observed from the side. Then the pencil shaped object also faded from sight.
