10. CONCLUSION: Pure hazy white solid object observed from 20 seconds in flight from SE to NW. Photographed. Photo analysis shows that the image edges are not sharp where both foreground and background images are. Nothing appears to indicate a solid object. Image appears to be caused by a drop of developer on the emulsion and then wiped off.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Considering the apparent moment of the camera, one would expect the object to be blurred in the photograph, unless the source was graded. There is little indication of camera motion.

INVESTIGATIVE ACTION: (During period 20 Aug - 19 Sep 65)
When the object was first sighted, the witnesses cut the first two frames, which apparently had apparently been exposed to sunlight. This action showed that the sight frames matched, that they were in apparent normal. There was one frame which duplicated the last two frames. These evidence was not saved.
All the investigative related to this case was negative. The print has not been "dodged", as the negative can be printed without any difficulty. The three large prints that are now available have not been explained. They appear identical to those which could appear on a print which had been made from an unexposed negative.

Neither the negative nor the print took normal. However, no positive proof of the cause of the UFO image and other marks could be found. It was thought to be noticeably than the original. Over 1.5 times the original area.

Microscopic (300x) photographs of the negative did not reveal any evidence of a composite picture, double exposure, etc. Three labeled.

Four additional plates (also examined) of the UFO negative were made under various lighting conditions. The plates appear uniformly dark and turned to a UFO record.

One logical explanation was developed to explain how the photograph of the negative was done. When developing the negative, a drop of developer could have caused localized uneven wiping. This would have produced a faint, uniform image. This sequence could have been developed, fixed, and washed as the negative could have been developed. This sequence would have produced a slightly darker than normal negative. Once the negative was fixed and washed, the steps could be reproduced to produce the UFO effect in this manner.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document, possibly a report or summary from Project Blue Book, discussing an investigation of a purported high-speed object observed in the sky. The document describes attempts made to gain access to the "photo lab" and obtain any photographs that may have been taken, but it seems no photographs were ultimately obtained. The text is detailed and provides information about the investigation and the reasons why no photographic evidence was available.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would:

This does not explain the picture, it does not explain the story. unlike it is an indication that this was a hoax, this was not a photograph. it was a rapidly high speed object with a camera having a slow shutter speed, the phenomena itself indistimating larger image motion for camera.

The investigating officer believes that this is an attempted hoax; however, it is necessary to have a picture to substantiate individual - quite unlike many of the "books" who frequent the Los Angeles area.

Attempts were made to gain access to the photo lab and personnel concerned where this film was allegedly taken. For possible significance was obtained from an executive in the corporation. It is stated that their in-house facilities for processing film was not permitted, but that a bootlegger could have handled this work or request someone else. The film was permitted at technical and that to paid the normal price to have this film processed.

The image shows a landscape photograph depicting a body of water, possibly a lake or ocean, with mountains or hills in the background. The image has a grainy, black-and-white appearance, suggesting it is an older photograph.

Transcribed text from the document:

On 9 March 1965, at approximately 1835 hours, a bright light was observed over the Pyramid Lake near Sutcliffe, Nevada, by Miss Arlene Sloan, a resident of Sutcliffe. The light was first observed moving over the lake from the northeast to the southwest, then it stopped and hovered for approximately 5 minutes. It then moved to the northeast and disappeared from sight.

Miss Sloan described the light as being quite bright, about the size of a basketball, and making no sound. She also stated that the light seemed to cast no reflection on the surface of the lake. The object was observed through a window of Miss Sloan's home.

The weather at the time was clear and Miss Sloan had an unobstructed view of the lake. The light was observed for a total of approximately 10 minutes.

The image contains a photograph of a UFO frame. The analysis report states that the print shows a rocky ground with a large hill on the right side, and the sky appears to have a large oval-shaped image. The report also notes that there is a slight trail on the complete image. The analysis indicates that the object in the photograph was far away at the time the photograph was taken, and there are no details or any kind of markings visible on the object. The report was approved by Charles F. Anspach and Robert L. Bise of the Photo Analysis Division.

PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-107 from Major Quintanilla Jr. (TDEW/UfO) to analyze one photo taken near Sloan, Nevada on 20 March 1965. The following analysis was performed by the Photographic Interpretation Division (DPT)(Photo Processing).
ANALYSIS: The print shows rocky ground with a large hill on the right side. The sky appears to have a large oval-shaped image. A dome appears on top of the oval. The complete image has a slight trail.
CONCLUSION: No further processing from the negative is possible. The photo is about as good as it can be. There is no detail or marking of any kind visible on the object that could help in identifying it. This type shutter would not smear an image. This image appears to be a genuine object. Any distortions that may be seen could be caused by a drop or developer on the emulsion, then wiped off.

The source of this UFO report visited the SPO PIO Office (SSI) on
12 August 1965 and provided the below information: Captain Charles
D. Keller, Commanding Officer at that time, conducted the interview.

Mr. ---- was employed by the ---- , Los Angeles, California.
On 20 March 1965 he was driving alone on U.S. Highway 91 about 20
miles out of Los Vegas. Going westward (arm of Sloan, Nevada) at
about 1930 hours he stopped the car on the road for some reason and
noticed a light off to his left in the direction of mountain area.
After stopping the car for about 10 minutes, an object 1000 to 1500
feet in altitude was observed. It appeared elliptical with a single
light intensity steady burning emission, relative to his car (estimated bearing about 150°). The UFO travelled in a northwesterly direction as he observed it.

He saw the object for the first seeing the UFO, took a camera which he had in
the car, but as he prepared to take a picture it turned towards him,
then turned away, and he did not take a picture. He reports that he
snapped the picture without using the viewfinder. It is the opinion that
he might be having memories of UFOs he reports to disappear." The sighting was
clear with no clouds or haze.

When the UFO first sighted it was at an angle of about 30° - 40°
above the horizon. It moved across the sky in a horizontal path and
passed in front of the car at an estimated distance of about 800 -
1,000 feet. The object then made a sharp turn and climbed in an arc
passing over a small hill which can be seen in the photograph, it was at
an angle of less than 30°.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

There was no sound, no heat, no changes of color or other phenomena noted. The object appeared to be of pure, hazy white, definitely solid-looking, and did not appear to have any observable structure. It was under observation for about 20 seconds. Mr. Brown's camera, with which the picture was taken, is an old type which has no shutter, but merely has the lens opened and then closed again, with an estimated time of a fill and a fixed speed of about 1/20th of a second. It uses size 120 picture film which was used to take the picture.

The Technicolor company also has facilities for the processing of motion picture color footage and offers special rates to its employees. Because of this, Mr. Brown had his film developed and prints made by the company. The UFO encounter resulted in some unexpectedly clear prints which showed an indication that the print has been "doctored." The print showed no characteristics which could be interpreted as being related to any known air object. The object gave the subject a sense of motion. Mr. Brown said the negatives were cut and not one continuous roll. The UFO photograph was one of the last frames.
