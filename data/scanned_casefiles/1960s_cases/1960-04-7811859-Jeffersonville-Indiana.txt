SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object, Jeffersonville, Indiana, 14 April 1960, Sighted

TO: ATIC (AFCIN-4E2)

1. The following information reported by [redacted] 15 April 1960 to the Louisville, Kentucky Detachment Office of the 5th District Office of Special Investigations, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is furnished for your information and any action deemed appropriate.

a. [Redacted] to a Field Representative (Fire Inspector) with the Grain Dealers Mutual Insurance Company, 1752 North Meridian, Indianapolis, Indiana. His residence address is [redacted], Illinois.

b. At 0145 hours 14 April 1960 he was traveling north on Road 31E at Jeffersonville, Indiana and as he approached within approximately 250 yards south of the intersection of 31R and Road 62 he observed an object entering his vision at approximately 30° on the horizon. The object was traveling from his left to right at about 20° to the left of his center of vision and downward at an angle of approximately 30° to 35°. It appeared to be moving in a rather flat trajectory and did not seem to have a curving or turning motion.

c. The object was in a burning condition for the first half of the time he saw it. It was then invisible for approximately one-fourth of the total time he witnessed its descent. It reappeared and then disappeared after completing another 4 to 5° of the arc. [Redacted] estimated that approximately seven to eight seconds elapsed from the first time he saw the object until it disappeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon. He did not see any explosion or impact with the ground.

d. The object seemed to have a length six to eight times its width and was pale green in color for the most part, however the leading part reflected changing colors which appeared to be from red to brown. The trailing end, although mostly pale green, also had a coloring of brownish red. The object's intensity in light would become very bright and then would dim, and the shape of the light would change.

e. Because of its great intensity in light and size [redacted] pointed that the object would have lit up the entire countryside but since the object only lit up the sky he estimated it was probably several miles from him. As the object appeared to come closer to the horizon its light

reflected so that he could see the outline of trees in the distance.
The object gave the appearance of being consumed as the edges, which
appeared to be of a brownish color, seemed to be eating away and
trailing sparks like debris falling after fireworks had disintegrated
in the air.

6. The speed of the object seemed to be a little slower than a
meteor. Further causing [redacted] to believe it was several miles
from him. The object impressed [redacted] as being of considerable mass.
He believed the weather conditions to be rather light, a full moon,
and partly cloudy.

2. [redacted] went on to say that two women and a man whom he had picked
up earlier also witnessed the object. He left the two women in New
Albany, Indiana and the man, a transient truck driver, in Louisville,
Kentucky. He could furnish no identity of these people other than
the older of the two women, who was forty to forty-five years and
about 5'2", had mentioned working as a waitress at Waldo's Cafe and
Beck's Tavern in New Albany, Indiana.

3. [redacted] added that he was not a sky watcher and did not imagine he
had seen any more meteorites than anyone else. He resides on a farm
close to Edgewood, Illinois and as a boy observed meteorites and has
seen them on other occasions. He said that by living on a farm in a
small community he felt he was able to better observe meteorites
which would not normally be seen by people living in cities because
the bright lights would distract their observance.
