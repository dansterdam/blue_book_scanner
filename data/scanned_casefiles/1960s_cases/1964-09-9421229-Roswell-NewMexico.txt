OCT 26 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

We are providing the following information in response to your letter of 18 September 1964.

Since there are over 8,000 UFO cases in the Air Force files, it would not be possible to "send a brief report of almost six out of nearly several." We have, instead, enclosed a Fact Sheet to you in August of this year. It provides information on analysis procedures and how reports are evaluated.

We do not have any photographs of unidentified flying objects. Some photographs have been submitted to us from time to time, but they have been determined to be hoaxes.

The bright light that you have observed on many occasions has the characteristics of a satellite. The satellites most commonly observed are ECHO I and II.

Sincerely,

MASTON H. JACKS
Major, USAF
Chief, Pictorial Branch
Public Information Division
Office of Information

September 4, 1964

Dear Sirs:

The information I received is not to what I would like to know.

I ask if you could send a brief report of almost 6 out 20 reports, hoax, balloons, etc. and some information on your analysis procedures are conducted and how you evaluate reports. If you possibly could send a photograph or two of some U.F.O.s.

I have been mystified by a flight of object which I watch on some clear nights.

It comes in the view of just under the big dipper. Its motion varies in speed it slows down for about 20 sec. and then it speeds up again.

In 5-6 sec. intervals it is changing brightness from real bright to a very dim so dim you could hardly see it. It travels from the NW to SE and then it gets very bright and then goes so dim its never seen again. It goes out of site near the planet Saturn.

1. Reference the attached letter from (redacted), dated
   4 Sep 64, requesting information on unidentified flying objects.
   This office has received previous correspondence from Mr. Lehman
   in Aug 64 and at that time he was forwarded one copy of the Fact
   Sheet.

2. The following information is provided to assist in answering
   the attached letter:

   a. Since there are over 8,000 UFO cases in the Air Force
   file it would not be possible to "send a brief report of almost
   6 our of 20 reports, boxes, balloons, etc." The Fact Sheet provides information on analysis procedures and how reports are
   evaluated.

   b. Due to the large expense involved in duplicating photos,
   they are not available to the general public.

   c. The bright light that he has observed on many occasions
   has the characteristics of a satellite. The satellites most
   commonly observed are ECHO I and II.

August 4, 1964

Dear Sirs:

I'm very much interested in the current UFO problem. We have had many UFO reports which I have studied from the news papers, books and my friends.

I am only 15 years old and know enough about science and the universe to know and understand what I am reading.

I would like to know if you could send some information of the UFO report, project 1947 when Apolold spotted Hying saucers, while on a mercy mission up to date on 1964.

Yours truly,

[Signature and identifying details are redacted]
