NEWARK EVENING NEWS, SATURDAY, JULY 14, 1962

Flying Ad,
Not Saucer

"It appears that those unidentified flying objects reported by scores of central New Jersey residents earlier this week may have been nothing more than an electrified advertising sign being towed by an airplane.

At least that is the latest story as to the object which had been described by anxious persons as a flying saucer. Large top or bottom lights spinning around it.

The 36-foot sign has 245 electric lights which flashed message exciting the nerves of an excited state Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.

The plane and sign are owned by a Wyncote, Pa. firm."

NEWS BRIEFS: Contrary to popular belief, saucer reports are not really becoming less frequent. Here 'n northern New Jersey, a brief "flap" occurred on July 11th. There were rather routine sightings in Clifton, the Oranges, and West New York, N. J., all of which received scant mention in the local press. The next New York sighting, in which several teenagers saw a glowing, spinning object high in the sky above a diner, was personally investigated by Mr. Robinson...

On the evening of July 10, 1962, I saw a very unusual aircraft. Thinking it to be an experimental aircraft, I observed it for a period of time and then proceeded with my previous activities. This morning, however, The Newark Star Ledger carried a front page story of a similar sighting the following evening in another part of New Jersey. By the description given in this article of the aircraft, it appears to me that I saw the same thing. The description given of the aircraft in the article, however, is very vague in my opinion. To add some information which might clarify this incident, I am sending you a brief resume of what I saw. I am sure this information will be of value to you.

1. I saw the flying object on July 10, 1962 at 11:20 P.M. ( Eastern Daylight Saving Time ).
2. The area where the sighting took place may be designated by the following:

U.S. Route 1     Popes, New Jersey
Hares Road       "        "
Burhan Drive     "        "


- page 6 -

3. I am fairly certain that I saw the object for at least five minutes.

4. Sky conditions: a. No trace of daylight
                   b. Many stars visible
                   c. Bright noon

5. The object was brighter than the background of the sky. The object's brightness was like automobile headlights at a distance of from one to several blocks from my vision.

6. The object, to the best of my knowledge, did the following:
   a. Remained stationary in space
   b. Accelerated at least once during the period
   c. The object changed from a small formed blurr to a definite tangible object
   d. Appeared to be revolving

7. The object moved in front of or above a passenger aircraft
8. The object remained to be solid
9. The object was seen at all times through opera glasses and for a period through a windshield.

10. To the best of my knowledge, the object made no sound; the object first appeared as well formed, off white "blurr" with a characteristic form and then moved in a possible, somewhat visible structure with definitive areas of light so does ending to a color similar to yellow with a range small end of a road 1/2.

12. More was one object:
13. The object was contrasted to the airplane which passed it, appeared to be considerably larger than the airplane, however.

14. When the object was closest to me, it was about the size of a baseball.

15. I first sighted the object while traveling in my car along a stretch of countryside adjacent to a housing development.

16. At the time of the sighting, I was negotiating a right hand turn off of the northbound lanes of U.S. Route 1 (roads, for Jersey).

17. Unidentified because of its quick appearance, size, and brightness.

18. Then I began to look at its position, location, north, the object then traveled toward the northeast; the object was approximately 1/2 degrees above the horizon.

19. At last set the object, it was traveling due east.

20. At the time of the sighting, there was a clear sky, little wind.

21. The object which I saw in the air possessed an amazing persistence to the plane and which was solid, have you noticed, appeared in straight lines, no papers, etc. of space stations or platforms.

22. The object was of advanced design apparently operating on a
23. At its closest position to me the object appeared to be from
3000 - 5000 feet very from me
24. Information concerning myself:

                                                        January 4, 5274
                                                        I am a male, 20 years of age
                                                        I am currently a senior at Rutgers
                                                        University

The following is a more detailed statement of the sighting with
sketches to elaborate on various facts:

[The image contains two hand-drawn sketches labeled "SKETCH 1" and "SKETCH 2" with various lines and trajectories drawn, but the details are not clearly legible.]


- page 8 -

I was traveling north on US Route 1 at approximately 11:00 P.M. July 1, 1962. I was approaching Newark from Route 1 at first sighted the object at point A (sketch 1) after completing the turn at Blowe's stone at one end of the short cut that leads to Chestler. Sketch 2. The bottom section of the object was cylindrical in shape and a-crossed about 30% of the width of the object. A very faint line of demarcation (A) appeared to be the top of the bottom (B) from the bottom. The object appeared to be a very dense gaseous mass but its form was too distinct to be a gas or cloud. 10% of the object (such as (d)) were irregular (fuzzy) such as the unbroken (A) area in light. The object in its entirety was not burning. The object was a bright white-gray. The object approached from nowhere and traveled on the course, initially, indicated in sketch 1. The object was low and traveled at the speed of a passenger aircraft, however, since it was so low I must have been much lower than a commercial aircraft. As the object proceeded along the designated course, I followed it up Paxas Road. At this time the object was only accelerating a little faster than I was. Upon seeing Burlin Drive, I observed the object to proceed to a position directly in line with Burlin Drive. At this time I went up Busher Drive to see. At this time I had not able locate the object. While traveling up Busher Drive, I could see the object hovering over the area opposite Busher Drive. In my side view mirror, at point B on Sketch 3, I saw Friedman joined me and we proceeded down Busher Drive.

After turning around to go down Durban Drive, I temporarily lost sight of the object. Then I saw it reappear and changed. It was at position A high in the air. It now had the appearance of a large aircraft but it's height still over it (as if it was covered with windows) and a bright red light shown from above the craft. An airplane past from south east to north west passing the object at same time. At this point I could not see the plane near it but it seemed to be in back of or above the object. It is my opinion that someone on the plane must have seen this same thing. I saw only very much closer. At this point, I compared the plane and the object. I knew the plane was a B-47 jet military craft. I parked at point X at which time I got my best look at the object. As soon as I was at the object traveled from point A to point B on Sketch 3. At this position the object was no more than 5000' to 3000 feet above the ground. I looked out of my front windshield at an approximate angle of 30-40 degrees to get a good view of the craft.


- page 10 -

It appeared that props B and C were circular and were revolving counter clockwise. Two windows in B and C were the most prominent features on the circles. The windows were all about the same size with yellow light coming out of them. I then stepped out of my car and got the best view of the object. Around B and C were indeed rings since the areas surrounding the windows was opaque and the windows were revolving upon something which forms a postcard sized circle from where I was looking. Area A appeared to be a void between the rings but was observed.

The red light and pole located by D were placed in the same position in relation to the rest of the distance (approximately the same inner antenna right hand side). The poles and red light seemed to act as a stabilizer or axis of rotation for the revolving rings. It appeared that a very dark area noted by B lies from the rings to the red light and pole in a narrow strip, but this was not conclusive to configuration. The impo tent thing about the ship was its constant gyroscopic motion in one plane around the red light and pole axis. After a short period the ship reappeared to the east (C), returned to (D) and continued to (2) and into the east beyond eyesight.

I am convinced that this was an aircraft of some kind. Its design is evidently much more advanced than any I had ever seen in operation, BUT IN SOME WAYS IT SEEMED MUCH LIKE A CRAFT OF UNUSUAL CONFIGURATION AND CHARACTERISTICS. I BELIEVE DOUBLY THAT THIS SHIP HAS PROGRESSED BEYOND OUR CURRENT STAGE OF AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT ITSELF IN ITS EXTREMELY GYROSCOPIC MOTION.

I would like to receive information that may be of help to you. I would appreciate your writing to me for observation concerning this particular "space craft".

Sincerely,
