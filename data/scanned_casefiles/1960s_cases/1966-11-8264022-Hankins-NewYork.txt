11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer has seen on several nights red, green, orange, and white lights in no definite formation. The objects had blinking lights and were seen in all quadrants in the sky. The objects were moving in a straight line with no erratic maneuvers. The objects would disappear behind the hills.

Investigating official talked at length with the observer. He feels that the lights reported as alleged UFOs were normal air traffic in the area.
