The image appears to be a grayscale photograph, but the details are very faint and indistinct, with mostly gray tones and no clear objects or features visible.

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

1/1/62

SW MIAMI, FLA. 26 JAN 62 OLCO/63002

The rest of the document appears to contain scattered letters and numbers, but they are too faint or blurry to confidently transcribe. The document looks like a heavily degraded or poorly scanned page with various letters (primarily A, B, D, E, P) and numbers scattered across the page.
