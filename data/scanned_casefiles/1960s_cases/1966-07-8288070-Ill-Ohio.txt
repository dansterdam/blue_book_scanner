American Meteor Society Report

The color of the fireball was white perhaps with a bluish tinge, but during the last part of its flight, when lower in atmosphere, it turned red. Its train was yellowish or red, but duration of this most uncertain. The fireball itself showed a distinct disk, but no certain numerical magnitude can be given. Estimates of duration, leaving out impossible long ones, are from 1 to 25 seconds. Probably the longer ones refer to duration of train. Using the average of 53 estimates, the duration was about 7.3 ± 3.1 sec. Velocity of 36 km/sec, which is obviously most uncertain. The object was observed or more places near end. Estimates of brightness vary widely, but under broke into two groups. Comparing the reports which seem more accurate its magnitude as seen from Chicago would have been -6, which incidentally would be near the zenith at once recorded most of the reports by telephone, while what they had seen was fresh in the observers' minds. The usual numerical data follow. A.M.S. No. 2338 observed on August 16 1936.

Date: 1961 Aug. 10.6
Sideral time at end point: 268°.55'
Began over: A = 88° 40' W, θ = 41° 03' N at 110 ± 34 km
Ended over: A = 88° 24' W, θ = 43° 23' N at 48 ± 24 km
Projected path: 256 km
Duration: 7.3 ± 3.1 sec
Observed velocity: 36 km/sec
Radiant uncorrected: a = 280°
Curvature correction: a = 4°
Parabolic zenith correction: h = 14°
Radiant corrected: h = -10°
                   h = -9° 2'
                   h = 3° 48'
                   h = -43°
                   h = -20°
Parabolic orbit: a = 4°, q = 1 A.U.

FIREBALL OF 1966 July 6
A.M.S. No. 2393

A very bright fireball was reported on this date at approximately 10:58 p.m., E.S.T. from stations in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa. However, the Illinois report must be of another fireball, almost simultaneously, as its path does not agree with other data. We then have available reports 6 kindly sent in from Wright-Patterson AFB. Considerable care from fully saturated solution in trying to secure a good solution, what is here given is from three observer reports. Three observers report its brightness was comparable to the Moon's, one that it can distinguish shadow, two gave its magnitude as -6. We may assume its zenith magnitude was about -8. Its duration was 2.75 ± 0.5 sec. 8 observers. Its color was blue green. No long enduring train was left. It flared once. The usual data follow but no orbit is computed due to the relative uncertainty of the atmospheric path.

Date: 1966 July 6.68
Sideral time at end point: 254° 46'
Began over: A = 85° 35', θ = 39° 40' at 134 ± 24 km
Ended over: A = 89° 24', θ = 40° 16' at 85 ± 33 km
Projected length of path: 164 km
Length of path: 171 km
Radiant uncorrected: 62 km/sec
Radiant corrected: a = 280°
Radiant corrected for curvature and zenith a = 280°
                                            h = -327°

h = 17° 12'
h = 15° 34'
h = -3°

Project Blue Book
Wright Patterson H.F.B.
Dayton, Ohio

On July 7, at about 10:58 or 10:59 P.M. I sighted a bright object in the sky. It was traveling from the South-east to North-west direction. As I watched it disappeared over Cut Municipal Airport in Vandalia, Ohio. As if it had disintegrated. It was a Blue-Green looking light, ranging from a deep Blue-Green to Light green and the tail almost white looking, with a green cast.

I observed the object for about 2 seconds before it disappeared. I had just getting off work. That's how I figured the time. I spotted it.

(P.S. I also believe in Flying Saucers. But I don't think the object I saw was one.)

Thank you

The officer observed the object heading west, it was like a real bright meteor, about one second observance. Arc headed toward the ground, it tailed out before it got 15 deg above the ground in sparks. It appeared as a rather bright meteor. He called to help confirm the observation of a meteor.

A lady from Vandalia, Ohio called to say that she too had observed the meteor for approximately two seconds, a few minutes before 11pm. She will send us a short description of what she observed. We explained that we would like to send her information to Dr. Olivier who is head of the American Meteor Society. She said that she knew Dr. Olivier and has read a great deal about him.
