This page contains a document with a detailed description and analysis of a fireball sighting that occurred on July 6, 1966. There is no photograph included in this particular page of the document.

The text in the document is as follows:

AMERICAN FIREBALL REPORT
MAY
The color of the fireball was a bluish color, as observed most of the time of its flight, when lower in the atmosphere. It seemed to have a bluish corona around it, but during the last part of its duration the color brightened considerably. The brightness was much greater than the full moon. 
The path of the fireball was such that it descended toward the northwest at an angle of possibly 30 degrees or more from the horizontal. Using the average of 38 estimates, its total duration was about 3 to 5 seconds. This type of observation is somewhat unusual and not normally encountered, although there are quite a number of reports which seem more accurate as to magnitude as seen from Chicago would have been about magnitude -7, possibly brighter. The distance from Chicago would have been approximately 250 miles. Fireball reports which seem more accurate as to magnitude and duration are not uncommon, and the usual numerical data follow. An examination of them will show marked similarities to A.M.S. No. 2308, of August 16, 1956.
Observed time at end point....1902 July 6-66
Elapsed time.......................3 to 5 seconds
Ending point...................30° 45' W, 6 = 41° 03' N at 110 ± 34 km
Radiant point.................28° 40' W, 6 = 45° 22' N at 98 ± 24 km  
Path..............................356 km
Apparent Velocity.............6.8 km/sec
Angle of sight from Chicago...40°
Curvature correction...........= 4°
Parallactic angle............h = 14°
Radiant altitude correction....h = 8°14"
Parallax correction..........p = 3°15"
Parabolic orbit.................a = 25°0'
                           q = 0.7 A.U. , w = 318°, ! = 64°.1 A.U.

FIREBALL OF 1966 JULY 6 
A.M.S. No. 2302

A very bright fireball was reported on this date at approximately 10:52 p.m. E.S.T. from several locations including Illinois and Indiana. The Illinois reports must have come from near Danville as reports indicate the fireball appeared in the northwest and traveled in a southeasterly direction. No reports have as yet been received from Eastern states which would verify how far from Chicago the phenomenon was observed.
The data given here are based on a solution using the method of Jacchia and Whipple. Two given magnitudes of about -7 indicate the fireball was highly brilliant. We may assume its central magnitude was about -8 to -9. The duration of the phenomenon was quite short, the fireball appearing and disappearing within 3 to 5 seconds.

Date..........................1966 July 6-66  
Observed time at end point....1902  
Elapsed over.................3 to 5 seconds
Ending point...............30° 45' B, 6 = 40°16' at 83 ± 23 km
Length of path................151 km  
Radiant..................28° 40' W, 6 = 45° 22' N at 98 ± 24 km
Velocity......................6.8 km/sec
Radiant uncorrected...........62 sec/arc
Radiant corrected for curvature and parallax...19°17' 
Radiant corrected for altitude...18°34'
Parabolic orbit..............a = 25°0'
                            q = 0.70 A.U., w = 318°, ! = 64°.1 A.U.

Subject: Vallance, Mrs. C.
Date: 7/8/66

On July 8, at about 10:55 p.m., a sighted a bright object in the northwest. The object appeared to be oval-shaped, with red and blue lights flashing, and was observed for about 15 minutes. The object moved from the northwest to the north, following a zigzag course. As it moved, it appeared to get smaller in size. The document states that the witness called the sheriff's office to report the observation.

(P.S. I also believe the object I saw was one. )

Transcription of the text:

DAYTON, OHIO 6 Jul 66 7/01552

Officer Baldridge of The Dayton Police Department called on 7 July 1966 have reading the morning edition of the JOURNAL Herald Newspaper. He had observed a meteor on the night of 6 July 1966 at approximately 12:55 am. He was sure that he had observed the same object as was mentioned in the newspaper. The newspaper clipping stated that the Air Force at Wright-Patterson said that the object a lady had observed was a meteor streaking across the sky. The officer observed the object heading west; it was like a real bright meteor. About one second observation. Are headed toward the ground, it tailed out before it got 15 deg above the ground in sparks. It appeared as a rather bright meteor. He called to help confirm the observation of a meteor.

A lady from Vandalia, Ohio called to say that she too had observed the meteor for approximately two seconds, a few minutes before 12pm. She will send us a short description of what she observed. We explained that we would like to send her information to Dr. Olivier who is head of the American Meteor Society. She said that she Rev Dr. Olivier had read a great deal about him. Object she observed was definitely a meteor and would be most happy to send it to us for transmittal to Dr. Olivier.

The image contains a compass rose diagram, but no other photographs.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve: this is how high the object was above the horizon (sky/line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "AT" on the compass where the object was first spotted, and a "LT" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on July 7, 1966 in Ohio.

Mrs. -- called on 7 July 1966 to inform us that she had also observed the meteor last night at approximately 10:55. Mrs. -- was driving west on Siebentholer, approaching the intersection of Philadelphia Avenue (which runs N to S). She was looking towards the Elder Beerman Store (slightly to the side). She suddenly saw what appeared like a falling star, arcing towards the ground (going west). Mrs. -- felt the object was approximately 400 - 500 feet when it exploded, object started to disintegrate when she was looking at. "The object came so fast, it looked quite near, disintegrated in the air." The color was whitish, bluish to red. Round then had a conical shape with tail. Could not hear any noise, though this might be due to the heavy traffic in the area. At Wright-Patterson AFB, was also riding in the car and she too observed the object. She said that it did appear as a meteor, just a little brighter than usual. Object was observed for approximately 1 - 2 seconds.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a hand-drawn sketch and diagrams. The sketch appears to be a geometric representation of an object moving across the sky, with instructions for the observer to mark various positions of the object. The diagrams include a compass rose and instructions for drawing the motion of the object. There is no text visible in the image that would require OCR processing.
