11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted a star like object white in color traveling toward the northern sky. The object was moving about the speed of an aircraft. Upon disappearance the object was in the west. The initial sighting was of an object traveling toward the north. The object then made a sharp turn toward the NW and proceeded toward that direction for a while. The object then became stationary over the town of Smith-town which was west of the observation point. The object was not in constant observation.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. In regards to the observation of the stationary object in the west it appears that the star Arcturus was being watched.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn is this form with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
