Arcturus was on an Az of 286 degrees and an El of 10 degrees at approximately 1900 hours local.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers noted a star like object white in color traveling toward the northern sky. The object made a sharp turn toward the north. The object then made a sharp turn toward the west, and then proceeded toward the west. The object then became stationary over the town of Smithtown which was to the northwest of the observation point. The object was then watched for a long period of time.
The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. In regards to the observation of the stationary object in the west it appears that the star Arcturus was being watched.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing the regulations covering UFO reports according to AFR 200-2. The document provides some general guidance on how to handle UFO sightings, including encouraging prompt reporting and thorough investigation of any sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 299-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your DD report in the morning.

One final note: Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings which are obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CIAC. But if the evidence seems more than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
