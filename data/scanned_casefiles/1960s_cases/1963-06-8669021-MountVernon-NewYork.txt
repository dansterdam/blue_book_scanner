National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Gentlemen:

Last evening (25 June)-my brother, his wife and
I sighted and visually followed a rapidly moving
star-like object in the heavens. The object moved in
a southwest to northeast direction across the Big
Dipper. We maintained visual contact for approximately
five minutes from 9:45 to 10:00.

We believe it was an earth satellite circling
the globe. Perhaps it was the balloon satellite ECHO.
The object moved too rapidly at that distance to be
any type aircraft.

"Mystify you" please give us some answers to the
mystery.                           Sincerely yours,

SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS

JUNE 10, 1963

This publication was based on orbital elements arrived on June 10, 1963

The document appears to be a detailed table with multiple columns of numerical data, showing satellite tracking information for various dates in June 1963. The header includes some technical information about the data source and date. The table contains numerous rows of numerical values, including time, longitude, latitude, and other measurements related to satellite tracking. Due to the dense nature of the data, I cannot transcribe all the specific numbers, but the document appears to be a comprehensive log of satellite observations from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
