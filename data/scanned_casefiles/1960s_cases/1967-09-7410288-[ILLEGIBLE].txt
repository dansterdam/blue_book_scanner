11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer saw a light that changed colors, white then moving steadily and blue when passing. The light was brighter then stars and passed behind western sky. The object 5 of the 164 was blank on elevation. Gradually to west. Caused no elevation as 35 degrees.

Some parts of the text are partially illegible or cut off, so I've transcribed only the clearly readable text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 28 Sept. 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

It looked like it might have been searching for something. It would stand still a while and then slowly move to one side or up down. Also at the top right hand side of the movie screen was a small white light which disappeared at the same time. We were facing east. Whatever it was was in the south eastern sky.

As far as I know it moved too much to be a satellite. It was also in east too long.

It seemed as though when it finally decided to leave it just sort of went up into the atmosphere.

I read a lot of scene fiction but I do not think this was my imagination as my sister saw it first and pointed it out to me.

1.  Attempts are made to comply with all provisions of AFR 80-17 and -17A. The majority of sightings reported to this base are received from off-base callers who are unable to furnish complete information. Buckley ANG Base is always contacted for corroboration of information; however, due to the small number of radar and control tower personnel at Buckley, the assistance rendered in this area is extremely limited. In the past, law enforcement agencies have not been of material assistance in determining reliability of witnesses.

2.  Reference paragraph 3, your letter, the reading of 35Â° referred to elevation of the object.

3.  This office will continue its efforts to furnish all possible information on each sighting reported.

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
FTD (TDETR)
Research and Aerial Phenomena Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio 45433

Dear Major:

In reference to your request for comments on the observation of Mrs. Catherine Manter made on 2 September 1967, at Boulder, Colorado, I would say that the evidence clearly points to the planet, Saturn. The "lead giveaway", I believe, is given in item 26: "A star, but with no rays".
The planet Saturn would be quite bright, but would not twinkle as stars do.

The fact that the object was in view for one hour and forty-five minutes, appeared as a "star but with no rays" and that the night was essentially clear, leads me to consider Saturn to be the stimulus for this report. I discount the statement that the object moved in several directions since nothing is said of the magnitude of this motion, and could easily be ascribed to the well-known illusion which arises from watching a point source of light for a protracted time.

The report has several minor inconsistencies in it but, all in all, there is nothing in the report that would seriously contradict the evaluation of the planet Saturn. The statement that the elevation was 35Â°, whereas Saturn was approximately 20Â° elevation, I believe, another example of the general tendency of people to estimate horizontal angles greater than they actually prove to be.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature of J. Allen Hynek]

The document appears to be a log or data table with multiple columns, showing dates and times from 2 SEP 67 to 4 SEP 67, along with various numerical codes and values. Each row represents a specific date, time, and set of data points. The document looks like a military or scientific log, with precise time stamps in the format like "01:02", "02:02", etc., and a consistent identifier "72469" repeated across many rows. The right side of the document has some dark smudging or damage that makes some text on that side difficult to read completely.


- page 15 -

The document appears to be a technical log or data sheet with numerous alphanumeric codes, numbers, and sequences. The text is primarily composed of numerical and abbreviated codes, with some recurring patterns. Some visible elements include:

- Repeated sequences like "2469 PB" at the start of several lines
- Date-like notation "03/09/67 33 UJ"
- Various numerical codes and groupings
- Some lines contain long strings of numbers and letters
- Parentheses appear at the right side of the page

The document seems to be a technical record or log, possibly related to military, scientific, or telecommunications data. However, without additional context, the specific meaning of these codes is not immediately clear.

The text is fully legible, though the meaning of the specific codes and sequences is not readily apparent from this view.

The document appears to be a data table or log with multiple columns of alphanumeric codes, numbers, and coordinates. The text is primarily composed of numerical and abbreviated codes, with some repeated patterns. The document seems to be a technical or scientific record, possibly related to astronomical, meteorological, or military tracking data. Due to the dense and repetitive nature of the text, it would be challenging to transcribe every single character, but the general structure involves rows with various coded entries across multiple columns.

The document header shows some recurring patterns like:
- 2469 PB
- 33/09/67
- 33 UW
- Various time/coordinate notations like 17.8x 39.26N

The right side of the document contains additional coded sequences, but the specific meaning of these codes is not clear from the image alone.

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of
10 September 1967.

2. If the object is as large as you say (six match heads to cover
the object) and you observed it for thirty minutes, why didn't your
girlfriend's mother and sisters also see the UFO?

3. We accidentally forwarded you two copies of PID Form 164. However,
you may do as you wish with the additional form since we have also
forwarded [ILLEGIBLE] a questionnaire.

ROCHESTER, N.Y. 14606
NOVEMBER 2, 1967

COLONEL MANATT,
I'VE JUST RECEIVED YOUR LETTER TODAY. I'LL
BE GLAD TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

QUESTION: WHY DIDN'T YOUR(MY) GIRLFRIEND'S MOTH-
ER AND HER SISTERS ALSO SEE THE UFO?

ANSWER: DEBBIE'S MOTHER WAS PAYING MORE ATTENTION
TO DRIVING THAN TO WHAT WAS IN THE SKY. IF SHE DID
NOTICE SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A JET. HER (DEBB-
IE) SISTERS WERE FOOLING OK PLAYING AROUND IN THE
CAR. THEY DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE IT.

WHEN EVER THERE'S A CLEAR NIGHT (THATS WHEN I

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 Oct 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Question 30:
The objects in the Washington D.C. area were also traveling south. They were of similar size and then speed. Appeared to be extremely fast. They held a similar formation - more of a cross or X shape though. Length of time under observation was around 7 or 8 seconds - instead of moving out of sight they made a 90Â° turn (toward ground) and disappeared from sight.

They were not white - an amber or yellow color. Height seemed to be similar to the ones in Colorado - if the size was close.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

On the night of Sept. 28 at 9:00 P.M. Three of us were sitting on the bank of the Colorado River, we were facing west. The night was very clear and bright, we could see through Spear to our right. The moon was directly behind us but had not risen yet.

We were at the 33 mile marker, 33 miles below Hoover Dam, 8 miles below Eldorado Canyon. Then directly across the river and at a distance of about two miles this bright object suddenly appeared, we all saw it at the same time. It was a clear and bright as a television screen. The object was silver white, extremely clear and bright, it had a small bright light in the center that shined like a diamond. The object was exactly square.

My first thought was to get the binoculars, they were in my boat which was 50 feet away. I got the glasses, to all took turns watching. The object remained stationary and bright for about five minutes, then it seemed to give off a blue green haze that came from the lower left side of the object. The haze kept becoming more bright and formed into an object about the size of the moon. As this was formed the bright white object seemed to slowly disappear, but the blue green object remained and became very bright. We could see the reflection in the river, it looked like the moon. Then from the lower right side of the object a bright beam of light shined down to ground. In the binoculars we could plainly see moving smoke or dust in the beam, also there was some kind of light coming up from the ground at this time. This object remained stationary and bright for about 20 minutes then slowly it faded away. Our estimate of the distance was not accurate, but it definitely was under five miles as there was a high mountain range about five miles away, and it was definitely between us and the mountain.

The following day when we returned to Las Vegas I reported this incident to Nellis A.F.B. later I talked to many people in Las Vegas who had seen the same object the same nite at the same time, but they had seen it higher in the sky and moving; slowly at a westerly direction. I was so interested in the object that the following week I went back to the area in the daytime and hiked in two miles to see if I could find any evidence of anything on the ground. We did not make a good search, we found nothing, but we did see areas where you could hide a battleship.

In August of 1965 I was fishing 100 miles east of Las Vegas, I was with [REDACTED]. At about three in the morning on a bright moonlight night we were both looking up at two extremely bright stars, suddenly one of them started slowly moving, to the right, then it came straight down, very slowly, when it neared the ground it went to the left and slowly went alongside the lake. The object was very bright, lots of color, blue, green, orange. We had binoculars and took turn watching it for about five minutes, then it went behind a low mountain and seemed to land there. NNE of there we were. About an hour later we saw an enormous explosion which looked as if it could be an atomic blast, this seemed to be about 10 miles away, the east wind would be near Parowan, Utah, remote country.

When I returned to Las Vegas I phoned the newspaper and told them what I had seen and I asked if any planes had been reported missing as I thought the explosion could have been a plane crash. There had been none.

Exactly two weeks later in the same spot we saw three more U.F.O.s. Two were silver and one was the color of the first one seen and it followed the same general pattern except it came from another direction to the east, but it seemed to land more the first one landed. The silver ones did not land and flew from west to east. We were in an area where many planes flew over we could always hear their motors and they were clearly different.

1. All were seen on a clear moonlight nite.
2. All were seen in totally remote country.
3. They could not have been an airplane.
4. They were not a falling object.

These last two sightings were on Lake Mead in the area past Ice Box Canyon in a spot called Pauls Snake Cove. I would gladly take someone in and spend the night with them. Most fishermen who have spent nights on the lake have seen similar objects.
