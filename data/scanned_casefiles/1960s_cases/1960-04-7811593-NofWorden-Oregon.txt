D'ENTREMONT HELICOPTER SEARCH OF AREA OVER WHICH OBJECT DISAPPEARED WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS EXCEPT A LARGE WHITE EMPEROR SNOW GOOSE RECENTLY KILLED IN FLD 1NM SOUTH OF THAT INDICATED BY THE OBSERVER. IT APPEARS MOST LIKELY THAT THE GOOSE WAS SHOT BY A POACHER AND WAS OBSERVED BY MRS. THE FLD IN WHICH IT FELL IS VERY MUDDY, HAVING BEEN RECENTLY FLOODED FOR IRRIGATION PURPOSES, HOWEVER, THE GOOSE IS STILL VERY WHITE WHICH TENDS TO SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT IT HAD BEEN RECENTLY KILLED. THE APPEARANCE OF BLOOD COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE IN COLOR DESCRIBED BY THE OBSERVER AND THE RESULTING CLOUD OF WHITE
