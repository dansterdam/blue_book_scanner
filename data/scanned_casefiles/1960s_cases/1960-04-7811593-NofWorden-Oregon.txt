FROM SEARCH OF AREA OVER WHICH OBJECT DISAPPEARED WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS EXCEPT A
LARGE WHITE EMPEROR SNOW GOOSE RECENTLY KILLED IN FID, 1100 SOUTH
OF FLD. OBJECT OBSERVED ON THIS OBSERVER, IT APPEARS MOST LIKELY THAT
THE GOOSE WAS SHOT BY A POACHER AND OBSERVED BY HRS FLYING
THE FLD IN WHICH IT FELL IS VERY MUDDY, HAVING BEEN RECENTLY
FLOODED WITH IRRIGATION PURPOSES, HOWEVER, THE GOOSE IS STILL VERY
WHITE WHICH TENDS TO SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT IT HAD BEEN RECENTLY
KILLED. THE APPEARANCE OF BLOOD COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE IN
COLOR DESCRIBED BY THE OBSERVER AND THE RESULTING CLOUD OF WHITE
MATERIAL.
