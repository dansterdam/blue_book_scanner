1. This replies to your recent letter in which you submitted a photo-
graph of an unidentified object which was taken on April 15, 1965.
An informal analysis has been performed on the print that you submitted.
The "object" appears to be the result of a chemical smear on the print.

2. Further analysis was not completed since you did not forward the
original negative and also, you did not observe an object. Thank you
for submitting your photograph to the Air Force.
