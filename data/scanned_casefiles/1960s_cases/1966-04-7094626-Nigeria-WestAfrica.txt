Dear Sir,

Please forgive the lack of direction in the above letterhead. I trust if I will be enough.

On Saturday, 2 April, as I was watching for satellites, a most unusual device crossed directly overhead on an easterly course.

The time was 18:24 G.M.T. and two things made it most unusual.
The first was its speed. In the 50 to 80 degrees of arc through which I observed it, not more than 2 minutes elapsed.

The other was that it blinked very brightly at a rate of about two per second. It seemed to be invisible apart from its blinking. Its brightness seemed to be at least that of a first magnitude star and when directly overhead, much brighter.

The color of the light was about that of a white star.

I have more than 4,000 hrs flying time, including U.S.A.F. fighter jet time (F-84g).

It is very quiet here and high flying jets are easily heard. There was no sound whatever.

I would be very interested to hear from you if you have any information on this. I have seen many satellites and in my opinion this object was 'neither a satellite or an aircraft.'

Sincerely,
Bob Edger
