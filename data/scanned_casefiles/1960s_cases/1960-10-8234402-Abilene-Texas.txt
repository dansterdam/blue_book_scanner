Dear Sirs:

At 0:10, or possibly a minute or two later, C.S.T., this morning, I was sighting my telescope on the great nebula of Andromeda when I became conscious of a light object moving in the sky, rather rapidly, in that immediate area. The object appeared to be of about fourth or fifth magnitude, and I judged that it had crossed the Milky Way about half way between Cygnus and Cassiopeia. It was traveling in a direction somewhat south of east, and passed close to the great nebula of Andromeda, a little south of the Pleiades and south of the Hyades. At which point I took my eyes away from it and could never find it again. Its course would have taken it very close to Rigel, possibly just a little to the south of it.

When I first noticed it I thought that it was an air plane and took my head away from telescope to watch it better. It was moving too fast to be an airplane flying at an altitude great enough to be individuals. It was velocity was not as great, as that of most meteors. After taking my head away from the telescope and finding the object, and then watching it an instant, I was still able to count to ten or twelve (not rapidly, but at a faster rate than one-second intervals) before losing it among the stars.

Sincerely yours,

c.c.- McDonald Observatory
