10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Elliptical, size of grapefruit. Color was very similar to a star, very bright. Obj was traveling on a steady course, seemed to bounce every five seconds. First observed angle 45° and azimuth 295°. Disappeared on an approx heading of 60°.

11. COMMENTS
Obj was probably planet Venus. On day of sighting planet was of magnitude -4.3, as bright as it ever gets. Planet was low on horizon and in a direction which coincides with that reported by witness. Obj disappeared with setting of planet. Description of obj favorably matches that of objects which are distorted and given apparent motion by atmospheric refraction.
