Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

CHISHOLM, MINNESOTA
25 SEPTEMBER 1965

At 0755, observer noted five orange colored objects in the western sky.
These objects appeared for about thirty seconds and were moving toward the north,
at an elevation of about 30°. All of a sudden three of the objects made an abrupt
turn toward the southwest and the other two seemed to just disappear. During the
entire time of the sighting the objects seemed to keep the same altitude. Observer
also stated that the objects were moving much faster than a jet, which she had
watched before. Particular attention was given, by the witness, to notice if there
were red or green lights which she had seen on distant planes flying at night, but
stated there were none.

COMMENTS
The observation has characteristics of being either aircraft or a balloons;
however, certain factors conflict with such a conclusion. A weather balloon from
Duluth would have been in the area at the time of the observation, however, the
duration conflicts with this conclusion. Since the witness insists that the
objects traveled much faster than an aircraft and made extremely abrupt turns, aircraft
are ruled out as an alternative. Also, there were no reported aircraft in the area.
As such, the case must remain in the unidentified category.


- page 7 -

A call was made on January 14, 1966, to Miss [redacted] of Chisholm, Minnesota. Reference to sighting of 25 September 65.

Report remains in unsatisfactory condition owing to absence of quantitative data. Almost entirely possible that it was that of an aircraft. As long as the witness insists that the lights traveled faster than that of an aircraft and made a extremely abrupt turn,

The case must remain in the unidentified category.

Some text appears to be very faint or partially illegible. The document seems to be a form or report with numbered lines, but most of the specific text on those lines is not clearly readable.

At the top of the document, there appears to be some header information, but the details are not distinct enough to confidently transcribe.
