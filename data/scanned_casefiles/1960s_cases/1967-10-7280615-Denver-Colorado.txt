35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Just a recap of the information covered in the questions above:

I was in a deserted parking lot talking with Ron Weiner and for no reason looked up into the northern sky and saw this (these) object. It passed much faster than a bird or flight of birds making no sound and holding a formation so perfect that I cannot personally accept the idea that I saw a flight of birds of any kind - also I have never seen birds which reflect light without having it vary in intensity as they moved away from the light source - in fact I have never seen a bird reflect light in any manner.
