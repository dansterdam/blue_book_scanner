PLACE: VISTA, CALIFORNIA
10. CONCLUSION: Possible (HOT AIR BALLOON)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an object that was a bright gold color. The shape was like that of a car cupola and the edges were sharp, but light extended beyond the craft's edges/halo. COMMENTS: Originally the report was given for 3 Feb 63 by a young boy. The boy's mother was given a witness to the event so a 117 was sent to her. She stated on her complaint form that the sighting had occurred on 2 FEB 63. Surface winds for Vista at 2000 hrs. were from 010 deg. at 05 knots and at 2100 hrs from 010 deg. At 2200 hrs. the winds were 010 deg. at 5 knots. It is felt that a hot air and an hour later had a westerly it is felt that a hot air balloon and an hour later had a westerly explanation for the observation.

ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.
ACCORDING TO MY SON (WHO ARRIVED HOME BY CAR) they first saw the object while pulling up to the curb and then got a better view as they drew closer to it. I say an object which was somewhat larger than a star and stood still over the city in an area about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon. It gave off a faint light and passed over the sky in about 5 to 10 minutes.
Since my husband had a (pretty much so) similar experience as did my son, I will make this for both of us.
