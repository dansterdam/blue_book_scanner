1. DATE/TIME GROUP: 3/0587

2. LOCATION: Vista, California

3. SOURCE: Civilian

10. CONCLUSION: Possible (HOT AIR BALLOON)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-8 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: W

8. PHOTOS: ☒ Yes   ☐ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes   ☒ No

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an object that was a bright gold color. The shape was like that of a car cupola and the edges were sharp, but light extended beyond the craft's edges(HALO effect).

COMMENTS: Originally, the report was given for 3 Feb 68 by a young boy. The boy's mother was given a witness to the event so a 117 was sent to her. She stated on her completed form that the sighting had occurred on 2 Feb 68. Surface winds for Vista at 200 hrs. were from 010 deg. at 02 knots, at 2100 hrs calm and at 2200 hrs from 100 deg. at 04 knots. Since the wind both an hour before and an hour later had a westerly it is felt that a hot air balloon is a possible explanation for the observation.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVE PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Approximately 9 p.m., my son and his father arrived home by car. They had both seen the object while pulling up to the curb and my son came in to get me. I saw an object (about the size of a dime at arms length) of a bright gold color come over a hill and pass over the sky in about 5 to 8 minutes. It then went over the other horizon.

Since my husband had a(pretty much so) similar experience as did my son, I will make this for both of us.

Main source for illumination was moon, streetlight, houselight

12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT
REFLECTED LIGHT OR WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND "WAS" COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER
IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER IT MOVED OR STATIONARY. DESCRIBE SHAPE. IF LIGHT, HOW BRIGHT DID IT

The UFO appeared to be solid, was very bright gold color. The object was sharp but light extended
beyond craft's edges (halo effect). Its shape was like that of a car cupola. Its source of light seemed to be itself, brighter
than moon.
