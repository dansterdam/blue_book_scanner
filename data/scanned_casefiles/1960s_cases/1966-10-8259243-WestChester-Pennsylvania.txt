11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers were watching TV when a loud noise was heard outside their house. They rushed outside and observed an object traveling slowly west to east on a very slight southeast course. The object was reported to have had various colors. One witness said that the object looked like a star and was moving very fast. Another said the object was a crawling ball of fire. Still another said the object was flying; very low and had red and blue lights. The red light was blinking off and on. The object was described as being larger than a shooting star in one case and as a star like object in another.

The data is inconsistent in several ways; particularly in color of the object and the description of the object.

I turned to the house and called Middletown PA to see if they had any reports at this time. Then asked was negative. Then called "Home Missile Base Brecknock PA" to see if they could tell me if they saw anything on their radar. Stat also was negative. They said they were working on a field problem with their radar at that time and some has previous. Then I called:

Phila International Airport to see if they could give me any information if they were notified. Told me to call Wilcox Group near Allentown.

The next day I discussed from who called and told me that they had called someone else who said they saw the UFO. They said they were for a description and tape it for me. Afterwards, they played it, they had calculated that they had seen it also.

Enclosed please find paper and names of all others that witnessed the UFO with me.
