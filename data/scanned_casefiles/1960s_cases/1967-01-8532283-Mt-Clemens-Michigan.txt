11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two witnesses watched a dark gray colored, disk shaped object
hover at a low altitude and finally move off very fast to the
southeast. Photograph was taken of the alleged UFO; however
detailed investigation of copies of the original indicated
a possible hoax.

The case is being carried in Air Force files as insufficient
data. For evaluation since the original photographs were
never analyzed by the Air Force.

FORM
FTD SEP 63 0-329 (TDE)    Previous edition of this form may be used.

The original photography would provide a basis for determining a range of sizes for the object. Knowing the size of the image within the photo format, the focal length of the camera and applying the observers reported range to the object from the camera a gross determination of size can be determined.

The original photography would permit a comparison of edge sharpness between the helicopter and the unidentified object. It was reported that the object was further away from the observer than the helicopter. If this is true the edges on the object would not be as sharp as those of the helicopter. The enlargements provided indicate that object is nearer than the helicopter but we don't know if the enlargements are at the same magnification, therefore ruling out this check on the reported information.

INVESTIGATION OF LOCATION OF SIGHTING

The area is on the shore of Lake Saint Clair just south of the mouth of the Clinton River. The pictures were taken through the 2½ inch pipe structure shown in picture #5. The object was reported as being "directly east out over the ice about ¼ mile away."

Picture #1 was taken with an identical camera (Polaroid Swinger) standing in the same spot. The horizontal line across the lower portion of the picture is the edge of the ice cut on the lake. The horizon and the opposite shore are not visible.

Picture #2 was taken in the same spot with the lens at maximum opening.

Picture #3 was taken with the lens at minimum opening.

Picture #4 was taken to show the relationship of the pipe and tree to the observer. A diagram and measurements are shown on attachment #1.

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

The family was very reluctant to talk or give up the original prints of the pictures. The boys stated that "about 5 minutes after the saucer left, they took a picture of a helicopter." However, the numbering on the back of the prints indicated that at least one picture of the object was taken after a picture of the helicopter had been taken.

Picture #4 was claimed lost, but they stated that it also showed the object. (It has since been found but not seen by the investigator.) Permission to examine the originals cannot be obtained. However, the originals were examined by Mr. [redacted] who stated that they showed no evidence of tampering or alteration.

LEO (250)

DETROIT JAN 16 (AP)--ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING EXPERTS ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS SAID TODAY THAT PHOTOGRAPHS OF A FLYING SAUCER TAKEN NEAR HERE LAST WEEK ARE APPARENTLY AUTHENTIC.

ALLEN HYNEK, CHAIRMAN OF THE ASTRONOMY DEPARTMENT AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, ALSO SAID THE PICTURES WERE STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO OTHER PICTURES OF UFOs HE HAS INVESTIGATED.

HYNEK, A CONSULTANT TO THE AIR FORCE'S PROJECT BLUE BOOK, WHICH COORDINATES ALL UFO REPORTS FOR THE MILITARY, COMMENTED IN AN INTERVIEW THAT HE HAD EXAMINED NEGATIVES COPIED BY THE NEWS FROM THE ORIGINAL POLAROID PRINTS TAKEN LAST WEEK NEAR THE DETROIT SUBURB OF MOUNT CLEMENS.

"ANALYSIS SO FAR DOES NOT SHOW ANY INDICATION OF AN OBVIOUS HOAX,"

WHAT STRIKING THINGS TO ME IS THE SIMILARITY THESE PICTURES HAVE TO OTHER PREVIOUSLY REPORTED UFO SIGHTINGS AND ALSO TO SEVERAL DESCRIPTIONS I'VE TAKEN FROM ORIGINALLY WELL-KNOWN CASES OF A DISC-SHAPED OBJECT. IT'S INTO A DEFINITE UFO CLASS, HYNEK SAID.

"AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THESE PHOTOS SHOW A METALLIC, DISC-SHAPED OBJECT," HE SAID.

THE PICTURES WERE TAKEN AROUND 2:30 P.M. LAST MONDAY BY TWO HARLEM TOWNSHIP YOUTHS, GRANT JAROSLAV, 17, AND HIS BROTHER DAN, 17.

HYNEK SAID THE YOUTHS TOOK FOUR PHOTOS OF THE UFO AND ONE OF AN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER, WHICH REPORTEDLY WAS IN THE AREA AT THE SAME TIME. ALTHOUGH ITS CREW REPORTED SEEING NOTHING.

THE YOUTHS SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND IN A FIELD AT THE TIME THEY PERMITTED THE OTHERS TO BE REPLACED AFTER TAKING THE PHOTOS.

THE BOYS' MOTHER, MRS. BETTY JAROSLAV, SO FAR HAS REFUSED TO LET THE AIR FORCE HAVE THE ORIGINAL PRINTS.

COPIES OF THE PRINT ARE BEING STUDIED BY THE AIR FORCE.

Attn: Dr. J. T. Ratchford

REMARKS:
Dear Tom,

Please see if you can get some expert opinions with regards to the size -? the alleged flying saucer. As you can see by the enclosed photo analysis report, our people at Wright-Patterson are very reluctant to offer a guess or opinion. If at all possible please expedite because the news media is clamoring for an expert analysis of the photographs. If your friend can come up with some definite measurements the only thing I will say is: That photo analysis indicates etc, etc, and I would not mention the organization. Many thanks for your help and I will be waiting anxiously for some sort of conclusion. If anything definite is derived from the photos please call and the paper work can follow later.

IN TURN

1. Reference your request for information on an unidentified flying object sighting of 9 January 1967, Mt. Clemens, Michigan. The report was investigated by Major Nyls, Selfridge AFB, Michigan. Major Nyls has requested the original prints of the photographs taken, on three different occasions; however, to date the family has been very reluctant to talk or permit the original prints to be viewed by the Air Force.

2. Analysis of the available photographs failed to provide any definite information pertaining to the identification of the unidentified object. The original photographs are required to ascertain whether or not a fruitful analysis can be made. Copies of the original prints were made by the Detroit News and provided by a reporter, Mr. [illegible], to Major Nyls.

3. The original photographs would permit a comparison of edge sharpness between the helicopter and the unidentified object. Witnesses reported that the object was further away from the observer than the helicopter. If this is true, the edges on the object would not be as sharp as those of the helicopter. The enlargements provided indicate that the object is nearer than the helicopter but we do not know if the enlargements are of the same magnification, therefore, ruling out this check on the reported information.

4. Contact was made with Dr. J. Allen Hynek regarding his statements which were carried over the wire service 16 January 1967. Dr. Hynek informed our office that the only told the Associated Press that the photographs appeared to be of an authentic image. He claimed he was misquoted when the AP said that he, Dr. Hynek, stated the photographs were apparently authentic.

5. An evaluation of the original prints is essential in making a comprehensive evaluation on this sighting.

Memo for the Record:
10 Jan 67

Call was received from Major Nyle, Selfridge AFB, Michigan (ex-3115) in regards to a UFO sighting over Lake St. Clair. He said that photos were taken of the object by two men as they were out in their back yard. The object was about a quarter of a mile away and hovered before speeding away. He said that he would send copies of the pictures as soon as he could with camera data. Major Nyle said that he had contacted SAFOI and told them of the sighting. The sighting should have a lot of public interest.

Memo for the Record:
11 Jan 68

Contact was made with Major Nyls (ex-3115) in regards to the sighting. He said that he had gone out to the scene of the sighting and had seen the original pictures. He said that the family was very reluctant to talk about the sighting. "It was a very funny Family". Major Nyls stood in the same spot and looked in the direction that the picture was taken. The pipe and tree branches that were in one of the pictures were only about four feet from the camera. These two things were in fairly sharp focus. The camera would have been at about a ten degree angle with the ground. Major Nyls contacted the helicopter pilot but the pilot saw nothing out of the ordinary. There was ice on the lake which ruled out the possibility of the object being a boat of some kind. Major Nyls looked for a boat but did not see any. The family's back yard looked like a junk yard. Major Nyls looked around the yard for something similar to the object that could have been thrown up into the air, but could not find a thing.

Major Nyls was asked to go back to the scene and take a picture which would correspond to that taken by the observers, and to obtain additional information. Particularly was asked to make measurements of the distance between the camera and the pipes and tree branches. He said that he would send the photos right away.

Major Nyls called and said that the photos should arrive at WP AFB by T-33 aircraft at approximately 1800 hours. He said that he thought that the photo could have been faked by hanging something from the pipe that appears in the pictures. He would try to obtain the original pictures for our use.

12 Jan 67

Major Nyls called to say that he would try to obtain the original pictures. He was puzzled by the fact that the boys said that they took all the pictures before the helicopter was seen, but according to the numbers on the pictures the helicopter was seen before the last picture. Major Nyls also said that he had noticed a coarser texture of the grain on the helicopter picture. The helicopter was supposed to be closer and higher than the alleged object.


- page 14 -

Memo for the Record:    26 Jan 67

Major Nyles called from Selfridge AFB in regards to the Mt. Clemens, Michigan photograph of 9 Jan 67. Major Nyles was convinced that this was a hoax. He said that the young boys only took pictures of a UFO and a helicopter. The pictures clearly indicate that the helicopter picture was taken in the mist of the pictures of the UFO. The numbering scheme on the photos indicates this fact to be true.

The boys said that they saw the helicopter five minutes after the UFO had left. He said that from his calculations picture number 5 was taken from a kneeling position. The camera was definitely lower in picture 5 than the rest. The object in picture 5 is higher in relation to the tree branches than other pictures. If the object was suspended from the tape it would have been higher in the kneeling position.


- page 15 -

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:   17 April 67

Conversation with Major Nyls revealed that he made the model with about 4 inch diameter basal wood. The top and bottom were painted a light gray while the band around the middle was a darker gray. Four pound test monofilament fishing line was used to support the model. He built the model as close as he could to the actual photograph's alleged UFO.

STATEMENT

As of 1200E, 13 January 1967, I have been unable to obtain any of the original prints of the UFO sighted near Selfridge AFB on 9 January 1967.

On 10 January, I personally visited the site and requested these prints from the boys' Mother, Mrs. to facilitate in the investigation. She stated that she did not have them and that they were in the possession of the boys' Father. The boys' Mother and Father are divorced.

On 11 January, I called Mrs. and requested permission to re-visit the site to take measurements and photographs for investigative purposes. I also requested the permission to see or borrow the original prints. Permission was given, but I was still unable to obtain permission to see the prints. Although I advised her of the importance of these prints to our investigation, she stated that she would think about it and call me.

On 12 January, I was called by Mr. who was the reporter originally contacted by Mrs. stated that he and the boys' Mother had agreed to give the Air Force one of the original prints. After receiving this information, I again contacted Mrs. and stated that she had not agreed to this and that she would think about it and let me know. I then contacted Mr. who stated that he thought the Air Force should be given at least one of the prints and he would attempt to convince his former wife of this.

On 13 January, I called Mrs. to offer her a complete set of enlargements in exchange for one of the original prints. She stated she was supposed to get a set of enlargements from the Detroit News but she would call me back on this.

I feel that further contact at this time could produce unfavorable results; therefore, I am awaiting her call.

1. Attached is some technical data obtained at the site of UFO on 9 Jan
67 near Selfridge AFB, Michigan. This information was obtained on 18 Jan
67 at the request of Dr. Hynek.

2. The "A", "B", "C" in lower half of the drawing represent camera positions for the three pictures. The center of each frame is drawn to a datum line which represents a plane through the pipe framework. Angles of intersection, distances to datum line and pole and distance from pole to intersection of center line and datum line are shown for all three pictures.

3. Method used was to position camera on tripod as near as possible to exact position held in photographer's hand when originals were taken, then take measurements shown. Position of camera was obtained by duplicating exact relationships between the branches on the tree to each other, the pole and to the edges of picture frame. Camera used was a Polaroid Swinger.

I was watching my favorite T.V.

T.V. went crazy. My two

Bubbling there and on the floor
I could. It was awful. I turned
2 T.V. a tiny 12" set on for detect
2 minutes.
What caused it. I have no idea
I know there nothing wrong with
either dogs ears. I had them checked,
But neither is my T.V. set wrong,
But in stead a zig zag on it. It
went like a rack of wire turn loose
like this on it. & it made
a funny noise.

Only reason I am writing about it my husband was a det west army man with 12 years air force service.

I have two values along & if something is wrong with them I mock surely want to know it. so since there was nothing caused he found I thought you might be concerned.

Their Saucer Photograph of Jan. 9 Made With Polaroid Camera—AP

MADE OF BALSA WOOD

Officer's Saucer Photo
Like Those of Two Boys

By JACK JONES
Daily News Staff Writer
An Air Force Investigator, probing a January flying saucer, has come up with a photograph similar to that taken by two Michigan youths.

Maj. Raymond W. Nyls, operations officer at Selfridge Air Force Base, said the photo was taken during his investigation of the sighting near Mt. Clemens, Mich.

THESE BOYS, Dan Jaroslaw, 17, and his brother Grant, 15, unidentified, flying over hovering area over Lake St. Clair within sighting distance of self-edge AFB.

Note: The rest of the text is partially cut off or illegible in the lower portion of the document.

The image contains two black and white photographs:
1. A portrait-style photo of two young men
2. A blurry photograph of what appears to be a UFO or flying object

Some parts of the text are illegible due to the low quality of the scanned document. I can partially make out some text, but cannot confidently reproduce entire paragraphs or sections. The document appears to be a typewritten report with multiple columns, but the resolution makes comprehensive OCR challenging. I recommend using a higher resolution scan for more accurate text extraction.
