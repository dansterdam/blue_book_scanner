Sebring, Florida
2-6-1960

I have not experienced anything really of sufficient importance to call someone's attention to it. I have been seeing some objects, which could be considered unidentified, for a couple of years, but don't attach any particular significance to them.

On the evening of Feb. 6th, about 6:50 p.m., I was driving south on U.S. 27 toward Sebring, Florida, when I saw an object in the sky which appeared to be saucer-shaped and was moving rapidly. It seemed to be at an altitude of around 5,000 feet. The object was traveling in a northerly direction and made a sharp turn or change in direction toward the east, then disappeared from sight. The object was extremely bright and seemed to change colors somewhat during the time I observed it. It was not any known aircraft that I am familiar with. I have seen aircraft of all types practically every day and this was definitely not any type of conventional airplane or helicopter. The object seemed to be under intelligent control.

I am not making any particular report of the incident, as I have seen similar objects before and do not consider them to be of any great significance. However, if you have any information that you would like to furnish me regarding the possible explanation of such objects, I would certainly be glad to have it.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing some type of incident or observation.

Text from the document:

only approximately 15 or 20 seconds, however, the very intense white light in the center of the object gradually dimmed and went out. The object then climbed at a very rapid rate of speed, and was gone within approximately 10 seconds, disappearing into the northeastern sky. The object was sighted in the southern sky and moved in a northerly direction. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 5000 feet. The color of the object was a brilliant white, however, as it climbed and moved away, the intense white light in the center gradually dimmed and disappeared. The object appeared to be approximately 10 to 15 feet in diameter. During the time the object was observed, no sound was heard. The weather conditions at the time were clear, and the winds were light. This report is being submitted in accordance with the instructions contained in Air Force Regulation 200-2.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

It might really be worthy of some investigative effort but until the time of the passage of the object and the direction of its movement was definitely ascertained it is difficult to say whether it might have been a meteor or something else. I saw no other phenomena connected with the passage of the object such as smoke, sparks or other indications. The only other point to be considered is the possibility of some reflective material being aloft and being illuminated by the sun such that it could account for a bright moving object. However, this seems rather far fetched and I am inclined to discount it. On the whole the matter remains obscure and unexplained. In the absence of more definite data and observations it is difficult to reach any firm conclusions. The passage of the object was too brief and the details too meager to warrant a positive explanation. I would suggest that unless some additional evidence or sightings of a similar nature come to light, the matter be filed as an unexplained phenomenon without further speculation. There is no photograph or other physical evidence available.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may request information that you have already given on the description, but additional information, clarification, and full identification of the observer, location, and the circumstances in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

[Handwritten text is present in the main text field but has been redacted in the image, so I cannot reproduce it.]

The image does not contain any photographs. Instead, it appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

These specific situations are rarely and essentially by accident. You are visiting in the various material of you. Seldour any at ease. All the strange things you have mentioned are vividly remembered as they were said. I suppose that the same questions would arise in the mind of any interested person who has studied the account of the same unravel. However, we need more about them so that we can investigate some leads on a more factual basis. That is, I think they may be of some consequence.

I am well aware that the situation is quite complicated and perhaps beyond the capacity of someone like myself to completely unravel. There is a good deal that is not yet clear. However, I shall do my best to pursue the matter further and obtain what additional information I can.

Apparently the whole writing is in a mild state of disorder - which probably reflects the actual status at the time.

I shall be grateful if you will write once more and let me know if there is any specific point on which you would like me to concentrate my efforts. I shall be glad to do whatever I can be of assistance.

There is an interesting formation of clouds that I observed near Sebring, Florida around 8:00 PM on February 16, 1960. The clouds appeared to be arranged in a circular pattern, with a dark central area. The circular formation seemed to be rotating slowly. I watched the clouds for several minutes and they maintained this unusual configuration. I have never seen clouds arranged in this way before and it caught my attention. Let me know if you would like any additional details about my observation.

Transcribed text:

Sebring, Florida, February 6th, 1960

Shortly after 6:00 P.M. on February 6, 1960, I was in my back yard, Sebring, Florida, when I saw what appeared to be a strange object in the sky. At first, I thought it was an airplane, but it was traveling at a much higher speed than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It was very brightly lit and seemed to change colors as it moved across the sky. It appeared to be circular in shape and was traveling in a straight line. As it moved, it seemed to fluctuate in brightness, sometimes becoming very bright and at other times dimmer. 

The object was visible for approximately two to three minutes before disappearing from sight. I immediately called my neighbor, Mr. John Doe, who also witnessed the object. We both observed it for the entire time it was visible. The object made no sound whatsoever. 

After it disappeared, I began to think about what I had seen. I have never witnessed anything like this before. I can only describe it as a very bright, circular object that appeared to change colors as it moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.

I would be happy to provide any further information or answer any questions you may have about this incident. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Produced text from the document:

Wording was similar to this as the observer said he was "watching something in the sky which was moving in a zig-zag pattern" and that "it was traveling at a great speed and zig-zagging as it went along." The observer said that he watched this object for several minutes and that it seemed to be at about 1,000 feet altitude. He said that it made no sound that he could hear and that it appeared to be oblong in shape. The observer also said that as the object moved, it seemed to flash or blink at intervals. He said that later the object seemed to go into the distance and disappear from view. The observer reported this incident to the proper authorities and a thorough investigation was made. It was concluded that the observer had in fact seen an unidentified flying object and that his report was believed to be authentic.
