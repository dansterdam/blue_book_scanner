57. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Another Incident -
One day, October 8, 1967, my Mother and I were standing out on the back porch facing the same hills. It was only mid afternoon, the sun behind us and the sky very blue. In the back of the hills very far away, my eyes caught a very fast moving object speeding at a reasonably quick rate across the blue sky. It was a black disk.

And nights before, only 3 times, I had watched a bright light similar to the one I have told you about, but these just sat very low in the sky, lights very bright and appeared to land on the hill. I never thought too much about it although once could tell it was unusual.

5/9 1st Sept. 6, 1967

Dear Mrs,

I used to think all this flying saucer bit was just a lot of static but since last night I have changed my mind considerably.

The time in a valley, 45 minutes from San Francisco.

Last night my dog got me up. It was 3:50 in the morning, and still very dark.

As I said, open the glass door, my eyes caught some thing. In the way about the hill across the street,

stood absolutely transfixed
for about 7 minutes then
suddenly the great bright
light that had been so

crazy? I knew I saw the

    off, but not at a fast pace. The light did NOT change color.

The light was big and bright.
I could tell it was no ordinary light.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The first 5 minutes or so it sat still on top of the hill. The intensity of the brightness did vary at moments. The last minute and 1/2 I watched it slowly raise off the ground as if suddenly coming alive. It seemed to travel at a very steady rate of speed. Being that it was not far away, I couldn't seem to see if it was hiding my way. It appeared to stay low, even in trees - as if feeling around. I finally dropped it curved. It (might) dropped or disappeared.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

No. If "Yes", describe: [Some additional text appears to be written but is partially illegible]
