Memo, TD-8 (Major Friend), 25 Sep 61, (U) Request for Review
1st Ind (TD-8/a/Mr. [illegible]/4201)                                   28 September 1961

TO: TD-8 (Major Friend)

1. The relatively low speed and high altitude of the subject UFO, coupled with an erratic course (including hovering), appear to rule out a normal aircraft target and favor some such target as a weather balloon.

2. It is suggested that if it is desired to pursue the investigation further, a check might be made of activities in the area responsible for launching and tracking weather balloons.
