34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 NOVEMBER 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I FEEL CONFIDENT, HAVING READ COUNTLESS ACCOUNTS OF UFO SIGHTINGS, FROM THE RIDICULOUS TO THE SINCERE, HAVING OBSERVED MANY SHOOTING STARS, HAVING BECOME FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH THE PRESENCE OF SATELLITES AND THEIR APPEARANCE TO THE NAKED EYE, AND BEING RELATIVELY FAMILIAR WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE CONSTELLATIONS, THAT WHAT I WITNESSED ON OCT. 14 WAS THE COMMON PASSAGE OF A SATELLITE, AS WAS STATED IN THE LETTER ACCOMPANYING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

At the top of the document, there is a handwritten "Over 13" notation.

The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns of numerical data, with some header information at the top that is partially illegible. The page seems to be from a technical or scientific report, with precise numerical entries arranged in rows and columns.

The document is a black and white scanned page with a slightly faded and grainy appearance typical of older documents. The text and numbers are dense and appear to be from a typewritten or computer-generated report from the 1960s.

While I can see there are numbers and text, the resolution and density of the data make it challenging to transcribe specific text with complete accuracy. The document looks like a detailed log or record of some kind of measurements or observations.

Gentlemen:

Several days ago I witnessed a puzzling phenomenon in the sky which held my curiosity.

Okt 6:18 PM local time, 5:18 PM Washington time (10:18 PM GMT) I saw what looked like a bright star travel very rapidly, headed in a direction about 5 to 10 degrees north of South East.

The object brightened and dimmed 3 or 4 seconds.

Thank you in advance for a information you may have on this matter.

Yours respectfully,

[Signature and name are blacked out]

October 30, 1963

Dear Mr.

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported seeing an unusual phenomena in the sky around the period 20-25 October 1963.

We are inclined to believe that what you saw was the passage of ECHO I which was in the Halifax area on October 24th 3:54 a.m. (GMT), 10 above the city, traveling in a southeasterly direction. However, since we do not definitely know the date of your sighting, we are enclosing a form (TWD 164) which we request you execute and return to this office. This will better enable the Air Force to evaluate the sighting. You will be notified upon completion of the investigation.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
