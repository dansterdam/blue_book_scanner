As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
DECEMBER 5, 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

FEEL CONFIDENT THAT SIGHTING WAS GENUINE.
ACCOUNTS OF UFO SIGHTINGS, FROM THE RIDICULOUS
TO THE SINCERE, HAVING OBSERVED MANY STARS, HUMAN
SIGHTINGS OF STARS, HAVE COME TO CONCLUSION THAT WHAT
WAS OBSERVED WAS NOT A STAR, BUT A SELF-LUMINOUS OBJECT
APPEARING TO THE NAKED EYE AND HAVING A RELATIVELY
FAMILIAR MOTION WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM. BUT WHAT I
SAW DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE STAR SYSTEM, THAT WHAT I
SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AND WORTHY OF NOTE.

AEP OCT 29 1953

National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen:

Several days ago, I witnessed a prolonged observation in the sky that I think deserved my curiosity.

On Oct 9, 1953, at 6:15 PM local time, I was engaged in observing the sky. At 6:30 PM, I noticed a very rapid, irregular movement in one direction about 10 degrees north of south. The object brightened and dimmed intermittently as it moved very rapidly, heading in all directions over an area about 15 degrees in extent.

The object brightened and dimmed intermittently, and I am convinced that it was not an airplane or any known type of aircraft.

I am forwarding this information for your files, in the hope that it may be of some value.

Yours respectfully,
[Signature redacted]

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The image shows a typed letter dated October 30, 1963, addressed to "Mr. [redacted]" and signed by "MASTON M. JACKS, PUBLIC INFORMATION DIVISION, OFFICE OF INFORMATION" regarding a UFO sighting report.

OCR Text Output:
October 30, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported seeing an unusual phenomena in the Saint John, New Brunswick area on September 30, 1963.

We are inclined to believe that what you saw was the satellite 1963-36C (EXPLORER XVIII) which was making a reentry in a southeasterly direction. However, since your observation does not definitely coincide with the satellite's passage, I am requesting that you provide some additional details regarding your sighting to complete the investigation.

When we receive this information, we will be able to evaluate your report and determine the nature of the phenomena you observed. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
PUBLIC INFORMATION DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION

[redacted], N.B.
