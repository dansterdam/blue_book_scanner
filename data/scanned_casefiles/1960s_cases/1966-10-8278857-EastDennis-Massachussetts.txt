[Handwritten note appears to be additional commentary]

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The object was of a spherical shape being about 2 feet in diameter. The object was compared to that of a mercury light in color with a brightness of approximately 20-30 x10^2 Lumens. A nearby swamp area was lit up by the object. The observer was in a hydraulic basket lift 30 feet above the ground checking a power transmission line. The object appeared to be about 50-60 feet above the ground and about 100 yards away.

The investigating official stated that the object was observed in the area of a power transmission line. Considering the area being in close proximity to salt water and the description and characteristics are consistent with these reported and fairly electrically charged cerenas, such is a possible and probable explanation.
