11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted a round beam shaft of light about the size of a star. It was white blue green. It was balloon-shaped with long tail which increased in size. There was a sound and the object seemed to vaporize and leave a contrail. Object traveled in a straight line to the west. The time of the sighting coincides with the launch of a Minuteman missile from Vandenberg AFB. There appears to be an unusual amount of visual phenomena associated with this particular launch.
