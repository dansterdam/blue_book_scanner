Your recent letter to the Central Intelligence Agency regarding your film of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) was referred to this office for reply.

This program is carried out under the designation, "Project Blue Book." The enclosed brochure explains our program since its inception in 1947.

The Air Force would be very interested in evaluating the film which you took. It will be necessary for us to have the original negative and/or photos. Your film will be returned to you, undamaged, with our evaluation. Also, the following camera data is necessary:

a. Type and make of camera.
b. Type, focal length, and make of lens.
c. Brand and type of film.
d. Shutter speed used.
e. Lens opening used; that is, "f" stop.

Dear Sirs:

On the night of February 28, 1967, I spotted some strange object in a field across the way from my house. Upon examination I found it to be some form of aircraft. I took four rolls of film (32 pictures) of this thing-the last couple of it taking off.

If this is some kind of secret vehicle or something I will refrain from acting on the issue. If, however, you have no knowledge or explanation for this, I will see to it that these pictures are published in every major newspaper and magazine.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]
