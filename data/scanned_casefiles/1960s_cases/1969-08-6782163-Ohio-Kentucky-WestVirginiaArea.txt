[Handwritten response]:
I noticed like a blue torch and the way the fire comes from a point in a blue torch were similar. The outline of the object was more solid than that of the fire from a blue torch though. The blue torch has fire being pinpointed on an object while the fire from the object spread over an area too wide to look like a blue torch.

My first time who was with me at the time helped me complete this questionnaire. Together we have tried to be accurate although it is hard to remember all details because it was unexpected and happen so fast.

Item 21 D discuss with Mr. Case. He seems to think he had a noise. I can't recall having any. I was driving the car on the color to me it appeared to be very bright white light in center to a green or turquoise on the outer edge.

There definitely was a round shape object such as a ball in front of the light.

'Meteorite' Causes
Stir In Much Of
Northeastern Ohio

MASSILLON, O. — (AP) — An object believed to be a meteorite caused a stir in much of northeastern Ohio early today, prompting numerous telephone calls to authorities.

The Ohio Highway Patrol said the flaming ball passed over the area on a northwest to southeast course. It was spotted here and in Akron, Medina and numerous other cities.

The object also was reported over Central and East Central Ohio skies.

An astronomer at an observatory in Cleveland said the object was a meteorite.

A Fairborn policeman and Greene County deputy sheriff reported sighting the "meteorite" about 1:35 a.m. Tuesday. No sightings were reported to Springfield police, the local State Highway Patrol or Clark County sheriff's office.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:    TDFT (UFO)

SUBJECT:    UFO Observation, 5 Aug 1969

TO:

Reference your UFO sighting of 5 Aug 1969. The stimulus for this sighting has been identified as an extremely bright meteor called a fireball. We would like you to complete the attached AF Form 117 on your sighting of the fireball and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Your report along with others will then be forwarded to Dr. Charles Olivier who is the head of the American Meteor Society. The data contained in these reports will then be used to compute the trajectory of the fireball and the probable impact point of the meteorite. Thank you for your cooperation and for reporting this incident to the Air Force.

After "explosion" reached max. dispersion, total viewing time of nucleus was approx 5-6 seconds. Trailing debris extended rearward throughout observation at a distance equal to approx. 6-7 times the diameter of object.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

TO: [Redacted]
Paris, Kentucky 40361

Your name has been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office as having seen an extremely bright meteor, called a Fireball, in the early morning hours of 5 August 1969. If this is true, we would like you to complete the attached AF Form 117 of your sighting and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Your report along with others will then be forwarded to Dr. Charles Olivier of the American Meteor Society. The data contained in these reports will then be used to compute the trajectory of the Fireball and the probable impact point of the meteorite. Thank you for your cooperation.

Specify gaze off own light.

Phenomenon appeared as a streak of light moving at faster... speed from South to North, without sound. It seemed to give off its own light - the front of the streak having a very small bright white lighting; this was followed by a brightly sectioned of blue light and by green light. (I cannot remember the order, whether blue preceded green or vice versa.) These two colors made up the majority of the streak. The tail of the streak was yellowish-orange, in color. The phenomenon seemed as if it would explode and did not.

Dear Sir,

Maybe this letter will be of interest to you. I don't know exactly how to explain, but I will tell you the best of my knowledge.

On August the 5th of 130 AM in the morning I was returning home from visiting some friends, and just before I got home while still on US Highway 22. A wing bright light came on over the while earth from where I was traveling in my car, it blinded my I almost ran my car out of the road. I almost come to a stop, I looked up at the sky in the east from where I was. I seen a bright red flame coming out the rear of a long black thing, with such was a long as a fence for the flame turned from red to blue like a causing a length, the thing that I was seeing the earth which I was looking many times on it.

with Pete and my wife at the
time we saw this thing I mean
told any one about then. But
today which is the 8 th day of August
I was talking to a friend officer
seeing this thing. So he told one
that another few who lives about
10 miles from me but told him
that he was returning home from
work and had seen the same thing
and he said the windshield got hot
on his car. it was the brightest
light I had ever seen I know that
they weren't because one at
that time wouldn't believe. One I just
might have known what its thought. But
I have straight long this thing ever
since I saw it and I think it
so may easy to report it and
I surely hope what ever reads this
