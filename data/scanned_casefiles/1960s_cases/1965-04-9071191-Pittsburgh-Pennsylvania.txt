Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

Reference is made to your letter of 27 April 1965 regarding an observation by your daughter of a certain object which could not identify.

The Air Force regards all reports as sincere. We have been engaged in investigating reports of this nature for 18 years, and we have on file more than 5000 objects or phenomena which the observer could not identify. Only a very small portion has been determined to be beings, warlike reports, hallucinations, etc. The attached brochure indicates the results of the Air Force project on this phenomenon to date.

Since the information regarding your daughter's observation was insufficient for an evaluation, it is requested that the attached PD Form 164 be completed as fully as possible and returned to this office. I can assure you that her name will be held in confidence, and in no way will she be subject to ridicule.

Sincerely,

2 Atch
