Dear Sirs:

On August 15, 1967, at approximately 7:55 PM, a number of objects were seen in the sky just north of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, by observers. The objects were approximately 9-10 in number, varying in size, and appeared to be saucer-shaped. They maneuvered in a very unusual pattern, accelerating rapidly, then stopping abruptly, and generally moving in a way that seemed to contradict the laws of physics as we know them. Onlookers thought they might be new aircraft or missiles, but the maneuvers seemed to rule out any known flying vehicles.

The objects were still visible when the observers had to discontinue their observations, as it was getting dark. I lost contact with the observers at that time, and I have no further information.

I hope this report is helpful. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
