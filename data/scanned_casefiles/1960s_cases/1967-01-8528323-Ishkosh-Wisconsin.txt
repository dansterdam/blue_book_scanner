Attention: Project Bluebook

Dear Sirs:

One morning in January I was looking out of our front window. It was approximately 7:20 am. I saw numerous circular objects. I went away thinking they were just clouds and saw that the objects were gone but the cloud that there around the objects were still there. I hope you will consider this very much if you would send me a copy of the blue book. Looks on back.

Sincerely,

{Send 164 and information}

Thank you!

The document also contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a hexagonal or octagonal object with circular markings, surrounded by several cloud-like shapes.
