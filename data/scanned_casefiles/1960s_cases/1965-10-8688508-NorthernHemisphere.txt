Photographs
of Comet
Ikeya-Seki

These few pages of Comet Ikeya-Seki photographs record its changing appearance during the two weeks following perihelion passage. Only a small sample of the pictures that were obtained by SKY AND TELESCOPE can be included here.

Above: On October 26th, only five days after perihelion passage, Comet 1965f was observed to have a 17-degree tail, from Table Mountain Observatory in California, operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. J. Young and C. Capen started this 15-minute exposure at 12:11 U.T. with a 155-mm. telephoto lens.

Left: Note the spine in the tail in Mr. Capen's Table Mountain picture on October 27th (18:00-18:04 U.T.) taken with a 6-inch f/15 refractor.

Below: American amateur J. Ruiz obtained this picture while visiting Tonantzintla Observatory in Mexico. The tail was nearly vertical as his latitude of 19 degrees north. This exposure is one minute at f/2.8.

Right: On October 28th, R. Minton, observing from a place 15 miles east of El Paso, Texas, recorded 20 minutes of tail on 35-mm. film with a 50-mm. lens.

Here is the text from the document:

Above: A starlike coma supporting a wide curving tail is captured in this picture by Eugene X. Harlan, Mount Hamilton, California. He took it at 1:16 P.M., October 29th, when Meigs Seki was 11 million miles from the sun and 17 million miles from the earth. In this remarkable photo, the comet shows a tail 3-4 degrees. Note the central bright core of the tail (also well shown in the inset). The picture was taken with a bright wide-angle lens, supporting a bright starlike appearance near the head. The pair of bright stars near the head are (left) Eta and Delta Cygni. Mr. Harlan used a small Schmidt camera for this remarkable exposure.

Above right: Taken at 12:00 UT, only an hour before Mr. Harlan's picture, this one by Glenn W. Shaw shows almost imperceptible motion of the comet. The El Paso, Texas, observer used a Nikkor-S F camera with an 1/2.5 lens of 50-mm. focus for this 20-second exposure.

Right: In the southern part of the horizon, the comet was more difficult to see. Observer John Richard Davis of Santee, Massachusetts, took this five-minute exposure at 9:50 UT. He used an 1/2.5 Aero-Ektar lens.

Here is the text from the document:

Above: At Los Cruces, New Mexico, Gordon Solberg, jr., used a reversed Moon-
watch telescope (his f/2.8 camera lens) to obtain this picture of the comet and the zodiacal light below Leo. The 10-minute
exposure on October 31st was started at 1151 UT.

Right: Alan McClure's record on November 1st from 12:13 to 1224 UT. At his
site on Mount Pine, he used an f/18 Zeiss lens of 10 inches focal length.

Below: October 31st large and small-scale views by Everett Kleiner, Scottsdale,
Arizona. At left, with a 135mm f/3.5 lens, the hour angle exposure began at
1233 UT; at right, 55-mm, f/5.6, six minutes exposure at 1220 UT.

Early-Morning Rising Necessary

Newly-Sighted Comet Visible Here

The newly-discovered Ikeya-Seki comet, named for two Japanese astronomers who first sighted it Sept. 16, has been sighted and photographed by Virgin-Patterson News base aerospace engineer Harold Schwartz of 1095 Boston court, Xenia.

Schwartz said the comet with a Polaroid camera mounted on a tripod at the roof of his home can be seen from about 3:15 a.m. to 5:15 a.m. each morning and should be visible through the end of this month. Residents would need to drive out of the city and be at an elevated location to sight the comet, but added that residents of Dayton area suburbs may be able to see the comet from their homes.

The last comet visible to the naked eye was sighted in 1954, and "The World Almanac" says that barring any other unexpected event, such as the appearance of the Ikeya-Seki comet, the next visible comet will be Halley's which will be seen in 1986.

Schwartz, an amateur astronomer, said no one knows now when the Ikeya-Seki comet will be seen again. This will depend on its orbit. He explained, "orbiting it won't reappear in this lifetime."

Comet At Xenia
Termed by astronomers the most spectacular comet seen near earth in more than 50 years, the Ikeya-Seki comet is shown here as photographed by Harold Schwartz from the roof of his home at 1095 Boston Court, Xenia. The flecks of light throughout the sky are the paths of stars recorded in this time exposure which was taken at about 5:30 a.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Mrs. [redacted] called 20 Oct 65 regarding the comet which supposedly can be seen at the present time. Sgt. Moody said that it is difficult to be seen because of the weather. It is also difficult to see without binoculars. Sgt. Moody suggested that she call again Friday about 10 o'clock.

Comet Keyes-Seki

FAVORABLY PLACED on the celestial sphere, October 2024 viewed a comet so brilliant that it could be seen with the naked eye in broad daylight, if the sun was hidden behind the side of a house or even an outstretched hand. This beautiful phenomenon is rare. The most recent day light comets had been 1927 IX, 1910 I, 1901 I, and the great comets of 1882, 1843, and 1811.

Many more professional and amateur astronomers viewed Comet Keyes-Seki at the dawn sites of late September and October 1965 with great interest periodically from day to day. And after perihelion passage on October 21st, the comet's tail became three-quarters of the earthspan distance in length. It was seen curving upward from the southeastern horizon during morning twilight.

At observatories around the world, great comet of 1965 gave an eagerly awaited opportunity to apply new methods of observation. The account herein, Mardon tells of this work by professional astronomers.

His account supplements the description on page 281 in November of the comet's discovery and early observation history.

Also in this issue is a portfolio of photographs of Keyes-Seki during the fortnight after perihelion passage. International material reported to us by various observatories indicates that much of Keyes-Seki is reserved for our January number. That is scheduled to contain a roundup of amateur reports.

During December, Comet Keyes-Seki will be visible with small telescopes in the southern sky in the middle hours of night, as it travels from Aquila through southern Pavo (Puppis). However, the strong southern declination limits viewing from the United States.

The following data are extracted from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from the orbital elements by L. E. Cunningham (page 332). Given here for an Universal time at five-day intervals are the comet's right ascension and declination (1950 coordinates), and probable magnitude:

November 26, 110°36'4, -29° 55', 64; 26, 106 22'7, -32° 57', 6.8.
December 1, 100°29'1, -34° 42', 7.2; 1, 96 55'5, -35° 33', 7.6; 1, 93 29', 7.9.
December 2, -37° 50', 8.2; 2, 90 30'2, -38° 48', 8.6; 2, 87 31', 8.8; 31, 77° 40'8, -37° 30', 9.1.

During December, the distance of Comet Keyes-Seki from us increases from 112 million miles, while its distance from the sun grows from 121 to 174 million.

So far, the path around the sun followed by Comet Keyes-Seki has been quite close to a parabola, but deviations be gin to indicate that it is in fact a very elongated ellipse.

Here is the text from the document:

The motion of Comet Ikeya-Seki within 67 minutes is evident in these daytime pictures taken October 21st in Japan, or Tokyo Observatory's Norikura station, 9,100 feet high. The sun is behind the 0.57-diameter black disk, which is the comet's head. The tail is projected far behind the comet's head along the sun line, because the comet's velocity was much greater than that of outflow along the tail. F. Moriyama and six observers took these pictures at 12:27 and 12:27 with a 12-inch 1/2.5 anastigmat in 1/250 second exposure. Tokyo director H. Hirose writes, "Observers at the comet station say these pictures are the best showing the comet."

The Great Comet of 1965
BRIAN G. MARSDEN, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

"A SCIENTIST'S COMET" was how most expert feel I. Withrop Hagar, describing the comet that brightened the sky in one of history's most spectacular displays on the hazy afternoon of October 20th. Report had been coming in to us all day of fruitless predawn vigils by people looking for the comet's tail, but on the other hand of new and important scientific observations.

Although a great disappointment to most of the general public as it neared the sun in October, Ikeya-Seki was a spectacular display for amateur and professional astronomers. So far, its performance has been so similar to that of the great comet of 1882 that it is unlikely its performance is now over. Even in December, Comet 1965f may be a very striking object in the morning sky, for the first time perhaps.

As told on page 281 of last month's issue, two Japanese amateurs, Genichi Ikeya and Sshiro Seki, on October 18th by two Japanese amateurs at San Shizuoka prefecture telescope, had found a new number of a comet. Excitement has been building up, and it was announced last week that the comet would become bright.

1965f was brightening in accord with expectation, and that the compact nucleus of the comet seemed to be telescopically visible. Even now it was only a few million miles from the sun.

On the morning of October 3rd (local date), the staff of the Smithsonian station at Woomera, Australia, noted that the tail was 4° long; three days later it had grown to 8°. The early photographs showed a typical "gas" tail with characteristic straight streamers.

By October 20th, the head of Comet 1965f was large, very bright, and almost round or shorter exposures, such as those taken at Lick Observatory by S. Vasilevskis and E. Hamid, at the Mexican National Observatory by M. Mendez, and at Table Mountain Observatory in California by C. Capen and J. Young.

For this 41-minute exposure on October 6th, G. Capen and J. Young, at Table Mountain Observatory used a telephoto lens of 250mm focal length, especially from the Northern Hemisphere.

Even in the southern continents, morning twilight masked most of the tail, and on October 15th, just 50 hours before perihelion passage, Woomera astronomers could see not at all, although the local was at a bright magnitude several times.

On October 20th, although haze prevented observations through the telescope in the eastern United States, Reysades was a conspicuous object with the naked eye or binoculars in broad daylight at many locations in the southwestern areas and across the Pacific Ocean.

At National Observatory in Texas, the comet was easily seen with the naked eye at noon (1800 UT), when only 2° from the sun, G. de Vaucouleurs writes that in mountains the appearance was remarkable.

Just half an hour later, Norbert Roth and Darrel Fendel saw the comet from the Smithsonian station at Organ Pass, New Mexico. Approximately 1° long and slightly curved, the tail seemed of about the same brightness as the 5½ day old moon visible at the time.

At Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, Stephen Maran compared with 16 x 50 binoculars from within the shadow of a 24-inch black disk erected to hide the sun. "The most splendid thing I have ever seen." he notes. From a distance of 125 feet behind the disk he successfully photographed the comet with an Exacta camera mounted on a Questar telescope.

At 0:90 UT (of October 21st) Elizabeth Roemer, judged the local to be moving -16 or -11; the nucleus was stellar and the 2' tail showed marked curvature.

That same afternoon, though he could not see the comet without binoculars, G. Van Biesbroeck in Honolulu noted the development had taken place since morning. Exact details were not striking, object from the background was a faint stellar-like nucleus in Pasadena.

Left: The comet on October 15th (left) and 16th. For these short exposures, Capen and Young used a 16/15 refractor at the Table Mountain Observatory near Wrightwood, California. By the time of the second picture, Comet Ikeya-Seki was near the sun.

Just 1½ days before perihelion passage, Comet 1965 appeared as a spectacular object. On October 16th, 18:10 UT, it was near Wrightwood with an 1.5 lens of 150mm.

With his unaided eye, David Meisel made these daylight sketches from Flagstaff, Arizona, as the great comet approached perihelion. The drawing at left was made October 20th at 2100 UT; the other two hours later. He saw about 2½ degrees of tail and a coma two minutes of arc (or less) in diameter.

Few observations have been reported during the following few hours; this is believed to be due to generally cloudy conditions. Clear skies in Prague, however, enabled Oldrich Hlad to observe the comet with the comet's unaided eye shortly after sunrise. According to L. F. Carrington's harm's calculation, the comet should have passed within a quarter minute of arc of the solar disk at 5:25 UT.

That morning in France (9:00 UT on October 21st), Haute Provence Observatory reported the tail was only one minute arc long. A few hours later at Bordeaux Observatory, West Germany, the daylight comet was estimated as of magnitude -6 or -7. A similar estimate was made in Czechoslovakia, using Eastern standard time (14:00 UT), when only the bare beginning of a tail was visible.

In the clearer skies of the western United States, 1965f was again a naked-eye object on October 21st. At about 17:00 UT, McDonald Observatory astronomers judged the magnitude as -3, and took black and white and color photographs. South African observers at the Table Mountain tracking station also made observations in broad daylight have been reported from Organ Pass, Flagstaff, and other locations.

Telescopic daylight viewing was also possible on October 22nd, when the comet's magnitude was estimated as zero at 17:15 UT from Lowell Observatory, and at -2 three hours later from McDonald.

The earliest observation in the dawn sky following perihelion passage was made at the Pretoria, South Africa, Moonwatch station on October 24th, and the next morning at Organ Pass, Flagstaff, with the naked eye. On October 25th, the Smithsonian station in Arequipa, Peru, a tail 20° long and 3° wide at its extremity tapered out from a head of magnitude -2.

Daytime drawings by Gerard de Vaucouleurs at McDonald Observatory:
Right: October 20, 22:30 UT with the 10-inch finder of the 82-inch reflector.
Left: October 21st, 16:00 with the 4-inch finder of the 96-inch telescope.

Swirls in the tail are noted on the 27th at Organ Pass and in Florida. By the 29th, the tail was readily noticeable an hour or so before sunrise in the climatically less favored New England states, but in the succeeding dawn the head could not be seen without binoculars or a telescope. During the first week of November the tail was still visible as it moved away from the sun.

The "atlas" tail spread over an length corresponding to 70 million miles.

The nucleus had become double. However, Point found on November 5th with the 36-inch (1/15 reducer) at the Astronomy Department of the U. S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Arizona, he observed visually and photographically a second nuclear condensation, situated about 15 seconds of arc on the tail spine, from the first, and about 13 magnitudes fainter than the first. The tail was about 8,000 miles long.

A possible third condensation was suspected, twice as far away as the second, and more than three magnitudes fainter than the first. Other astronomers reported additional nuclei, probably transient in nature.

Contrast the perihelion aspect at left (October 20th, 22:01 UT) with the perihelion one (October 21, 15:30 UT). Observers at Sacramento Peak Observatory, where the photographs were taken, noted that the tail foreshortened, most likely due to projection. Nonetheless, the tail length was well shown.

On October 21st at 18:17 UT, Adler and L. Chase saw the 15-inch and 12-inch with the 12.5-inch equatorial, noting some effects of the tail, well shown in the photographs.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The comet's nucleus appeared elongat-
ed on November 5th (top) and definite-
ly on the next day. The first continuous
exposure on the 5th began at 15:14
UT, the one on the same day at the 6th at
13:23. C. Capen and J. Young used the
6-inch Table Mountain f/15 refractor.

In the case of Comet 1882 II, one
month after perihelion passage, five sep-
arate condensations were seen along a
40-second arc. See a picture of them in
February, 1960, Sky AND TELESCOPE, page
204.)

The professional astronomers, Comet
Ikeya-Seki provided a very welcome op-
portunity to observe the spectrum of a
great comet as a small heliocentric dis-
tance. The last comparable chance was
in 1882, when spectroscopic techniques
and interpretations were both very primi-
tive.

In the visual spectrum of an average
comet, the most conspicuous features are
three bright bands—the Swan bands, due
to the diatomic carbon molecule, C2.
Most comets also show a pronounced
continuous spectrum, often with super-
imposed dark lines, much like the solar
absorption spectrum.

Photographic spectra began
in 1881, leading to the observation of
new bands toward the violet. These in-
cluded features due to triatomic carbon
(C3) cyanogen (CN), and the CH radical.
Then, in Comet 1882 I the sodium D
lines, fat 5896 and 5890 angstroms were
observed in emission, and these have
since been recognized as a normal feature
of comets at relatively small distances from
the sun.

Later, in September 18, 1882, the first spectro-
scopic observation of a comet in daylight
was made by Ralph Copeland and J. G.
Lowe, with a visual spectroscope attached
to the Lick telescope of Director Aitken's
observatory, in Scotland. They secured the

because similar lines were never found
in subsequent comets. But then, no inter-
esting comet was observed so close to the sun,
until now.

In an article published early in 1966,
the well-known Belgian expert on com-
etary spectra, Polydore Swings, expressed
his belief that traces of calcium and other
elements would eventually be found in
comets of very small perihelion distance.
His hopes have been realized.

On the morning of October 20, 1965,
A. D. Thackeray at Radcliffe Observatory,
in South Africa, obtained spectrograms
of the nucleus of Comet Ikeya-Seki, then
only eight million miles from the sun.
These showed bright lines of neutral
iron, and also the H and K lines of
ionized calcium. (Continued on page 2)

The comet over Maui, Hawaii, at about 15:00 UT on October 28th. A 35-mm
camera was used for a continuous exposure by personnel of the Baker-Nunn
tracking station of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Probably an
artificial satellite made the trail.

This unusual photograph of Comet Ikeya-Seki (1965) was taken by Alan McClure on the morning of November 1, 1965, at 1 a.m. Honolulu time, again at 12:13 Universal time. Well seen low on a large scale in the small hours, and the azimuth in the tail near 1c. At that time, the comet was about 51 million miles from the sun and 96 million miles from the earth. On this opportunity, one well-spaced photograph was taken of the comet from the 8,500-foot level near Mount Pinos in California. Mr. McClure used an 1/2 Zeiss aerial lens of 35 inches aperture and a panchromatic emulsion.
