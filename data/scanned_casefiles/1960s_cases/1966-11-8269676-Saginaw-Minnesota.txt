REPLY TO
ATTN OF: 29JIN                                                    10 November 1966

SUBJECT: Follow-Up Report on UFO Sighting (29ADV Msg, 290IN 11007, 10 Nov 66)

TO: JID (IDERJ):

1. The observer, [redacted] was driving home near midnight, Tuesday, 8 November 1966. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] own a small boarding house off a country road, about twenty miles west of Duluth, Minnesota, off Highway 33.

2. On the morning of 9 November, Mrs. [redacted] called the Air Base, and the call was routed to the 29th Air Division (NORAD) Intelligence Office. Mrs. [redacted] gave the names and telephone numbers of several people in the area who had sighted the light on previous occasions. The Intelligence Officer telephoned Mrs. [redacted], who said she and her husband had seen it at the same place (see drawing) that she saw it. She could not remember the time of the sighting, only that it was "a few weeks ago". The [redacted] had been driving west at the time, approaching their home on Highway 33. A Mrs. [redacted] said she saw it from her house, in the distance, looking southwest towards the [redacted] home. She had seen it "a few nights ago". These were the only people the Intelligence Officer actually spoke to, but they all said that many other people in the area had seen it on numerous occasions, always late at night.

3. On the afternoon of Wednesday, 9 November, personnel from the Intelligence Office visited the area and interviewed Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] was not present, and has not been questioned by Intelligence personnel. The area was forest of birch and fir, with low ridges roughly at right angles to the unpaved road. There were a few inches of snow on the ground and the road, and there had been snow the night of the sighting. Prior to that time, the only snow fall in the Duluth area that didn't melt before covering the ground was an eight inch snowfall 15 October, and this was all gone in less than a week. Hills and trees completely block the house from the UFO sighting point. Now was the house visible from the hill the car was on when the UFO was seen. No other cars were in the area at the time of the sighting, and the only power line was the one west of the house (see drawing). No other houses are on the road east of the [redacted] home, and no light sources of any kind. Highway 33 is not visible from the house, the UFO sighting point, or the low hill where the observer's car was. The trees average 25-35 feet in height and are fairly dense.

4. The [redacted] class and both [redacted] probably in their late fifties, but seem to be of average intelligence.

Here is the text from the document:

none of the people interviewed had any explanation of the light. They
were obviously not saucer cultists.

5. Mrs. [redacted] said her son heard nothing when he saw the object, but
later that night he was kept awake by a whirring sound which no one
else heard.

6. The light has only been seen in recent weeks, and some of the
sightings occurred when there was no snow. It did not melt the snow.
