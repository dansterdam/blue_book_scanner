35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The same feeling came over me that one before I sighted the UFO. It was flying so to go to bed and I looked out the window at the stars. It was like something wanted me to look outside. I looked out the window at the stars - the North Star was just stirring. Then caught something in the trees. We stopped; then 3 times it gave off big flashes like 20 flash bulbs. It moved in the direction of wind down and then went off like some camera turned the light switch off.

Like something draw me out to outside.
