I would like to report sighting a U.F.O. moving North to South at about 1,100 M.P.H. It looked metallic and was tremendous in size.It was as bright as a strip of magnesium ribbon burning.
It was completely silent as it moved across the sky except for one time when it went up about 200 ft. and it stayed that way for about 2 seconds and then very quickly dropped back to the same altitude. I studied it started at.I saw it at 11:30 Saturday the 4 of October; and I might add that it was an extremely clear night.
I would like you to investigate this.

Yours Truly,
