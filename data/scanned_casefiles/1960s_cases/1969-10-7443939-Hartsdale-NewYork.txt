I would like to report sighting a U.F.C. moving North to South at about 1,100 M.P.H. It looked metallic and was tremendous in size. It was as bright as a strip of magnesium ribbon burning. It was going straight all the way across the sky except for one time when it went up about 200 ft. and it stayed that way for about 4 seconds and then very quickly dropped back to the same altitude. I saw it at 11:30 Saturday the 4 of October; and I might add that it was an extremely clear night.
I would like you to investigate this.

Yours Truly,

[Signature area blacked out]

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
