8 FEBRUARY 1961
SAN ANGELO, TEXAS
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

PERIOD OF INVESTIGATION: 8 FEBRUARY 1961

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED SIGHTED

1. SUMMARY OF BASIC INFORMATION:
On 8 February 1961, the undersigned investigated a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of San Angelo, Texas. The investigation was prompted by a telephone call received from a civilian observer who reported sighting an unidentified flying object on the evening of 7 February 1961.

2. DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION:
The civilian observer, a Mr. John Doe, reported that at approximately 2015 hours on 7 February 1961, he was outside his residence in San Angelo, Texas, when he observed a bright, stationary object in the sky. Mr. Doe stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a steady, bright light. According to Mr. Doe, the object remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

3. CONCLUSIONS:
Based on the information obtained during the investigation, the reported sighting of the unidentified flying object could not be explained or identified. The object's behavior, as described by the civilian observer, is consistent with reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. No further investigation is recommended at this time.
