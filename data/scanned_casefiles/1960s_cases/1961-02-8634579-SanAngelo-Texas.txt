10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Reflective light. Very similar to Echo I in appearance. Object noticed at a position due S. Azimuth 70-75°. Object was moved on a heading approx 360°. Disappeared 45° above horizon. No maneuvers.

COMMENTS: Satellites in a N and S orbit are too small to be seen with naked eye, and light conditions prevalent at time of sighting could prevent a small satellite fm being seen. Balloon possibly launched fm a position S of observer's location unknown to reporting officer. Balloon was possibly reflecting rays of sun which had already set. However, due to lack of corroborating witnesses, this report is evaluated as Insufficient Data.
