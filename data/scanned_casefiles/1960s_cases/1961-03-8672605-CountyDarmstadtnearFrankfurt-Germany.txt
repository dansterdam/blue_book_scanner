Dear Sirs!                                                 April 4, 1961

I want to report to you a flying unknown object which I have seen in County Darmstadt near Frankfurt (Germany). The day I can't remember too good it must have been in the week from the 20th March to the 25th. But I think it was the 20th March. The sky was 100% clear. I spotted this object with my 12x50 binoculars. The surrounding area was full of woods and mountains, but a lot of hills. The sun shone bright and she was a little in back of me, but not too much time. 11 A.M. The object shape was from round to oval and had a milky glowing. I followed it move a couple of seconds, then it gained speed.

and I started to turn it color to orange, then it moved faster and the color went to light orange or yellow. When the object color went back to white and then to orange it went suddenly a different direction, now the object was slowing down and the color turned to white (milky). Then it arranged the same happening over again till to the yellow color and disappeared. A human being could never hold out the pressure which I think the object recorded. So therefore I assume it could have come from another planet of our solar system or a different system which is very fantastic to believe!

How I have seen this object
Eye     Binocular 11x50

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch depicting the movement and characteristics of a UFO sighting, with annotations describing its behavior and the observer's location.

The image appears to be a document with a large black redaction/censorship mark across part of it. There is a faint signature or text in the top right corner, but it is mostly illegible due to the poor image quality and black redaction. The document looks like an old envelope or letter with diagonal lines/creases visible. Most of the text is too blurry or obscured to read clearly.

The document also contains a "Mit Luftpost" (Air Mail) stamp and appears to be an envelope or letter.
