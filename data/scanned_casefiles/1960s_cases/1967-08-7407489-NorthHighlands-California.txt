PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 27/05/52
2. LOCATION: North Highlands, California
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6-8 minutes 
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-air
7. COURSE: North to South
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Possible SHOT AIR BALLOON

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers saw different lights similar to aircraft landing lights or artificial satellites. After the observer had watched the objects for about 30 seconds, the objects intentionally disappeared abruptly. A few minutes later, the objects reappeared and remained visible for some time. The description is exactly as would be expected for a shot air balloon. However, the observers give the direction of travel roughly SE, but wind was (considered) to be NW, which seems very possible that the objects were carried bag.

1. Reference letter FTD (TDET/UFO), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, with two attachments from the Security Police Division, McClellan Air Force Base, California, dated 1 September 1967. This letter records an observation of a UFO on 26 August 1967.
2. Inquiry revealed that at 2056 hours, 26 August 1967, the Security Police Division, MCCV, received several telephone reports from concerned citizens; however, no one at the time was able to locate the objects. As a possible stimulus for those reported sightings, a newspaper article #SR183 035854 dated 25 August 1967 in the Sacramento Bee could be considered.

The object was sort of round or oval shaped. It appeared to be very high in the sky and was reflecting the sunlight or a brilliant reddish-orange color. It seemed to be moving slowly and silently across the sky. It was about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It stayed in sight for over 5 minutes. The object did not appear to do any unusual maneuvers but just continued at a steady pace until it went out of sight.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 Aug, 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: 

"My thirteen year old daughter was in the front yard and saw a very bright light in the sky. It was stationary and seemed to be hovering. The object was oblong in shape, rather large, and appeared to be approximately 30 inches across the horizon. The brightest part of the object was in the center. Rays or beams of light were emanating in various directions from the center. These rays changed in color from orange to reddish orange to red. The rays seemed to illuminate the ground and the object. After a few minutes, the object suddenly took off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing in the distance. The entire sighting lasted approximately 4 minutes. My daughter was completely unnerved by the experience and came running into the house very upset. I rushed outside to see if I could observe the object but it had already left the area. We did not hear any sound from the object as it hovered or as it took off. The only sound was the crying of my daughter. The time of the sighting was around 10:00 pm. As I said, the object was stationary and seemed to be hovering for some time before it suddenly accelerated out of sight at a tremendous rate of speed. That is the extent of the information I can provide. I hope this will be useful to your investigation. Please let me know if you need any additional details."

Here is the text from the document:

To men who have study the matter more carefully than I, the case of the unidentified objects in the sky often referred to as flying saucers) has long been a matter of deep interest. Many of us have been fascinated by the reports which from time to time have come to us, and have sought diligently to discover some satisfactory explanation for them. This has not been easy, and I am convinced that the matter deserves further and more thorough study than it has yet received.

I am aware that there are many competent men—scientists, military and other authorities—who have examined these reports and have concluded that at least a considerable proportion of them can be accounted for as misidentifications of ordinary phenomena such as balloons, airplanes, planets, meteors and the like. And there is no doubt that this is true in many instances. But when all such cases have been eliminated, there still remain a number of reports which are difficult to explain on any such basis.

I do not feel competent to pass final judgment on this matter. I can only say that it seems to me that the official attitude of summary dismissal of the whole subject as mere superstition or hallucination is not warranted. I believe the problem deserves serious study by competent and open-minded investigators.

1. This refers to your correspondence on your unidentified object sighting of August 26, 1967.  Although we have written to you other times about similar sightings, you indicate that other reports have been received on sightings of garment bag hot air balloons. These balloons are similar to the objects you describe, and are the most probable explanation.  The upper dull glowing object is the garment bag, and the reddish and yellow pulsing lights are the burners which control the lift of the object. Some times the object is mistaken for something more exotic when the garment bag and as it rises, sparks and pieces of burning debris fall from the unsealed bag before they hit the ground.  Sightings of these objects have been reported throughout the country and the colors of these balloons are red, orange, yellow or white.

2. All of the above should be consistent with your sighting.  However, on your form you indicate that the objects traveled from the northeast.  This is the route these balloons are usually launched from the southwest.

3. We would like to know if you are positive that the objects were traveling toward the northeast. Could the objects have been traveling from the southwest?

Any additional information you have on your sighting may be helpful in clarifying this matter.  Thank you for your assistance in this fascinating matter.
