PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE TIME GROUP
26 Aug 67 27/0530Z

2. LOCATION
North Highlands, California

3. SOURCE
Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
Possible (HOT AIR BALLOON)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Two

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers sighted 2 different lights similar to aircraft landing lights or artificial satellites. After the observer had watched the objects for several minutes what seemed to be drops of molten metal started to fall from the trailing object after about 30 seconds of this, the objects intensified considerably then went out completely. A few minutes later the other one disappeared in a similar manner.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
8 - 10 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
NNE to ESE

8. PHOTOS
[ ] Yes
[X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
[ ] Yes
[X] No

COMMENTS: The description is exactly as would be expected for a hot air garment bag balloon. However the observers give direction of travel, roughly SE, but the wind was (according to the TWX) blowing toward the NE. Despite the conflict this still seems very possible that the objects were garment bag balloons.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    17    Dec    1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My thirteen year old daughter was out in the front yard and saw - a light moving across the sky, the place at it was being almost all north when she first observed it at approximately 30° above the horizon. She watched it moving towards the EAST when she first saw that might have (first) she thought it was an airplane with one landing light on. Later she thought it was a satellite, but then it occurred to her that the light was too bright. She then ran into the house to tell us to go look. By the time the object was visible only from our backyard part all five of us were watching. The two objects (now) seemed to alternate their speed - as judged by the distance between them. After watching for about 45 minutes my son said "Look" the back one as something dropping something. The rest of us then saw what seemed to be a copy of motion midair falling away from the trailing object. After about 30 seconds of this, the object's light extinguished accidentally, then went out and completely. There did not seem to be an explosion through. I went in the house at their time and called the Air Force.

to notify them of the phenomena. In the meantime my friend watched the leading object appear to stop. They then thought of who attempting to decide about it were through to return to the place where the trailing object disappeared - It also then started slowing some miles - again hovering like motion partial - and then it also disappeared.

I should also mention that this is the second time I have observed such a phenomenon. The first time I was alone and obtained a series of intricate movements by about six, seven degrees after morning in an approximate Southwest to Northwest direction. It was a clear, cloudless night about six years ago at about 2:30-3:00 AM. The location was approximately 11 miles Northeast of my home, in Roseville, Calif. Because the lights were in a tight formation, I made intricate more notes and moved from overhead (where I first observed them) to the horizon - it caused not have been search lights.

NOTE: I wanted appreciate hearing from your office if you could an unbiased helpful answer to this matter. Thanks you.

1. This replies to your correspondence on your unidentified
Observation of August 26, 1967. Although we have written to
six other instances on your sightings, you were the only one
to reply. Your description is similar to other reports we have
received on sightings of garment bag hot air balloons. These
balloons usually appear as two objects, one on top of the other.
The bottom object (brighter than the other) is the heat source,
and the upper object glowing object is the garment bag. Some-
times the heat source is birthday candles. When the candles
burn down, the platform catches on fire causing the object to
rise, and as it rises, sparks and pieces of burning debris fall.
We usually turn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after
the sparks start to fall, the object disappears. The usual
colors of these balloons are red, orange, yellow or white.

2. All of the above is consistent with your sighting. However,
on your form you indicate that the objects traveled from the NE
to SSW, but the surface winds were roughly from the southwest.

3. We would like to know if you are positive that the objects
were in the direction as indicated on your form. Could the
objects have possibly been traveling toward the northeast?

4. Any additional information you have on your sighting may be
returned in the attached envelope. Thank you for your assistance.
