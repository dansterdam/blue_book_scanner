UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: 2 MI. E. of Escanaba, Michigan
Date: 2 April 1960 Time: (EST) 19:22
Description: Object out of sight, vertical, approx. 40 sec and fading. Red colored, no sound seen. Moving rapidly, rather erratic motion, gaining in altitude. Estimated height 10,000 ft. and rising. Craft circular in shape and approx. 15 ft. across as seen at distance. Directed to the N. and was gone in about 40 sec. Witnessed by 2 adults and 2 children.
Direction of Motion: Ascending
Description (Witness) (AGNCY-982): There was a pulsating, flashing light reported.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planets, etc.): None
Radar Analysis (AFOFI√è-461): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): None
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Ruled out
Other: 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Fairly reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The extremely small size and short duration of the sighting rules out any astronomical or conventional aircraft type as the explanation. It is not understandable due to the type of object, or its motion, or its manner of disappearance. Further investigation may be required.
