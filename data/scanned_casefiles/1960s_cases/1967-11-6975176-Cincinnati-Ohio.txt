sweatly 9:20 I noticed another UFO. This time I moved it when it was on center as it went across the sky and it was 8:33 when it went out of sight. I at was flying rather low about 5 to 6 on the scale (say) and was flying from north to north. It gave off no noise. It was shaped like this:

[A hand-drawn triangular shape with white lights]

It wasn't blocked by anything all the time it was on full. There was not a cloud in the sky and the stars were very light. I was standing on a small hill and with no lights near to affect my night visions I had a fairly good view of it. It looked blank except for the lights, one on each corner and the thing in the middle. I was about a mile where I cited the other 2 UFOs and on an east-west street. It passed right over head and I had a good view of it this whole time. There was a service station right [illegible word]

To whom it may concern,

On the night of Nov. 5 at temp. was returning from a play near my home. page (illegible). They were traveling like this. By figuring out the time when I left the home it took about 5-6 minutes to cross the sky. It was a little before 7:40 p.m. and I left the home and a little after 7:45 at time I got home.

It was part of a phiffing color chain, I was moving, it looked like a blue-white color, and a flashing red and white. When they were playing a man met thought of was a satellite yet, reflected sun light refracting through the atmosphere causing the shifting lights. And if it was a satellite it would take on to count the facts they were going no slow and they gave off no spinning. But when they stopped and started flashing the scale while lights we know they were satellites. We watched it setting their and then he went off, and I managed the street to get the rest of my family got to see it, but they were no where to be found when they came out.

Here is the text from the document:

It looked about 500 o times larger, Charge a star so I glanced because of that else that it could be a satellite

This diagram shows the net type of my neighborhood and where the UFO went across. I didn't notice him until he was about where he is on my diagram.

Thank you
