Unidentified Flying Object report  
March 2, 1963

Gentlemen:  
This sighting was made Saturday morning, 5:15 to 5:17 a.m., 6/8/63. The object was observed above the horizon due East of Huntington, W.Va.  
This star is not known to me. But it may be following it followed the late morning hours about midway around the horizon between the Morning Star and the Big Dipper. It is a fairly rapid traveler, reaches about 30Â° above the horizon between 5:15 and 5:45 a.m. Staying the morning star as not in size, brilliance and visibility, the star was a poor N.W.  
The U.F.O. was visible to me as a point of light about the size of a car headlight. It was motionless and unblinking, a twin of the star tuse as a locator point.  
I first noticed the U.F.O. when looking at the star and wondered about a star like object in line with it, then it moved across the sky at an angle, slightly south of it, then it moved across the sky at an angle from South and East to North and West, passing the horizon in a bank of fog.

Transcribing the text from the image:

So, as I could estimate, it covered about 10-12 seconds on my stopwatch and moved westward along the two minute time.

Weather conditions: Clear, cold, half-moon, a number of stars, but the item was blue and moved very low, just over the treetops.

Observation point: An East window, top floor, main office, the W.Va. Works, Conners Steel Division of H.R.E. Regional Inspection Supervisor's Office.

Note: this U.F.O. was visible only a present to light, it was too far away to make out a tail or superstructure. It did not pulse or dim out. It did not vanish or appear to change direction or speed at any time. This report in December of 1963.

Text found in the document:

Perhaps they have an improved model which does not brighten or change color as tell-tale evidence of sudden speed-ups or ultra-high speeds. 

Sincerely,
Huntington, W.Va.
