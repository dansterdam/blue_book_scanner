Thing in sky appeared to be star but was flashing red and green. After long time started to move to NE back a near star to side and then up over top of it. I called nearby TV station & police dept., getting no explanation I tried to contact weather bureau but got no answer. Finally got explanation from Dan Claire Police. Sighting probably weather balloon reflecting city's lights.

Socially, the man at the airport was a man with child on about an hour talk & was to meet a star blinking up and give white. He a student to the Wisconsin State College of Eau Claire. Although I was not an outstanding scholar, I have tried to reason out these occurrences relatively, especially since the thought of any happening occupying another limit would seem to oppose my religious teachings.

Dear Sirs:

The letter will find is the same one I sent to General Mills' Balloon and Aerospace Systems Department in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I received an answer from [redacted] statement which read as follows:

"I have read with considerable interest your letter of September 6 in which you describe many strange sights which you saw in the sky in recent days.

"The General Mills Company, the University of Minnesota, the G. T. Schjeldahl Company, and Raven Industries, all within a few hundred miles of Minneapolis, have been releasing many balloons. We released two on September 6. It is entirely possible that the sights you saw were these balloons, except that your description does not fit the payloads that we happened to be flying. I wonder whether you are aware of the fact that the U. S. Air Force has been investigating for years reports by citizens of this country on strange objects in the sky. They call these sights 'UFO' or Unidentified Flying Objects. Many intelligent and responsible people have sworn to seeing these sights. A book has been written about this, in fact it has been the subject of a television program and articles in Life magazine.

"I am taking the liberty of returning your letter which you sent to us and I suggest that you send it to the U. S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and get their statements. Good Luck."

I hesitated quite a while in sending this letter in the hope of gathering additional information. In my clear nights now we are able to see some things in the sky which are similar to our previous sightings in every respect except one--they no longer move. In has been explained to me that these things could be stars with air currents causing the flashing; and so they could be, but that about the ones that moved? Up until this year, I have never seen stars flashing such distinct colors. Even through 7 x 50 binoculars the colors are very distinct.

I would like to add that I have not since seen anything to resemble the thing with so many lights that went over our house.

I hope you have some answers to these questionable occurrences and that you will send them to me as soon as possible.

Thank you,

I am writing to you at the suggestion of our local police department to answer a question which has several of us extremely curious. It's about some objects we've seen in the sky.

It all started about four weeks ago. We were watching a thing in the sky which appeared to be a star but was flashing red and green. After a long time it started to move from below a near star to the side and then over the top of it. Being very excited I called the nearest TV station and the Chippewa Falls Police Department getting no explanation. I tried to contact the La Crosse Weather Bureau, but got no answer. Finally I got an explanation from the Eau Claire Police Department which satisfied me. An officer told me that it was more than likely a weather balloon reflecing a city's fluorescent lights. I couldn't think of any city in that direction large enough to do it, but I left it go at that anyway.

About three weeks later we saw the same thing in the same direction, about NNE. After watching it for a while we started looking around to see if there were others. Then we saw what appeared to be the same type of thing only quite a way farther off in the opposite direction, about SSW. After standing still for about 15 minutes it suddenly started to move very rapidly. We saw it racing in an easterly direction faster than any jet plane I've ever witnessed. It moved a long way and was still moving when we left for home to call somewhere to tell what we had seen. I contacted the airport in Eau Claire. The man there said he could see the one in the north, was uncertain as to what it was. He suggested that it might be a weather balloon too. When I told him of the speed of the second one he said it may have gotten caught in a jet stream (to me it seemed to move too fast for that). He then said I should call him back if anything else developed, as he had to make a weather broadcast. I went outside only to see another one as bright as the first, shining in the west. I called him back. He told me if I really felt that it was serious enough I should call the Civil Defense Unit in Minneapolis, or else the Minneapolis Weather Bureau. My mother suggested I let someone else worry about it. About three nights later on a somewhat cloudy night four or us noticed two such objects slowly for about two hours after the clouds began breaking up. We didn't do anything about it.

Tonight is the clincher. I looked to see if there were any such objects, and sure enough, there was one shining bright in the north. I pointed it out to my mother. Then I saw another in the west. I called the airport. They told me to get the number of the nearest civil defense unit from the Eau Claire Police Department. A police officer told me to contact Paul Boley, head of the civil defense unit in Eau Claire. Being unable to reach him I again called the Eau Claire Police Dept. and described in detail what we had seen. The officer suggested that I call the local police in Chippewa Falls requesting that they send a squad car to witness what we were seeing. I didn't know whether to do it or not. Both my mother and I went back out to see if the object in the north was moving. It was then that something happened which I don't think you'll believe. I hope you don't consider this a crackpot's imagination or some sort of a mirage, although I probably would were you. Non-the-less, this is what happened.

Something caught my eye going overhead at about a 75° angle to the open porch. From where we stood, I pointed it out to my mother exactly. At first glance I thought it was a plane. It seemed to be closer than 1000 feet from us. It was moving at a moderately fast speed. It was all lit up with yellowish orange lights. It looked like an enormous passenger plane with several windows, with its interior lights on, although we couldn't make out its shape, except that it was big and long. Quite unusual was the fact that none of its lights were flashing. They all burned a steady yellowish glow. It had lights on the rear which was turning a bright orange. I always thought planes had no bars a red light on one wing and a green one on the other, both flashing. This craft had no such lights. We watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds as it traveled out of sight. We listened to see if it was a plane. It made no sound! If it had been a plane as close as it appeared, it would have made a tremendous roar.

as it seemed, surely we would have heard it.

I went back into the house and phoned for a squadcar. Two officers were amazed when I showed them how there were now two objects in the north and one in the west, all flashing red and green and moving. They got another officer to look at them - he, apparently more familiar with such problems than the others, told me again that these objects might be weather balloons and that one that moved fast may have gotten caught in a jet blast. He said he wasn't sure, but that this would be the only explanation he could think of. When I asked him to explain the other thing with its many yellow lights and no sound he couldn't. He pointed out that unusually passenger planes don't turn on their landing lights after they're off the ground. He said the only way to get any sort of concrete answer would be to write to you.

I'm not sure about all the dates of the sightings, but as I started writing this letter at about 11:45 P.M., September 6th, there were visible. At 12:30 they were all gone. On September 3rd we spotted two. About 2 or 3 days before that we saw three, SSW, and about 3 weeks before that we saw one. They have been appearing in the NNE, SSW, and in from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

Incidentally, the man at the airport said a woman had called in about an hour before I did to report a star flashing red and green lights. I'm a student at the Wisconsin State College of Eau Claire. Although I'm not outstanding, a scholar I have tried to reason out these occurrences rationally, especially since the thought of any happening occupying another planet would seem to oppose my religious teachings. But frankly, I'm at my wits end. I hope you can help to answer these questions which have aroused my curiosity.

Another thing I forgot to mention may be merely coincidence, but I'll point it out to you anyway. The day following our first sighting the radios carried the story of Russia's test in the atmosphere with a large explosion. The day after the third sighting my girlfriend told me the radios were announcing that Russia had made a second atmospheric blast. I'm wondering what kind of story the radio will carry tomorrow.

Enclosed is a self-addressed, stamped envelope. I hope you will send me your answer as soon as possible. I'm sure there must be some sound explanations for these happenings.

Thank you,

Chippewa Falls, Wis.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TD-E/Major Friend

SUBJECT: Request for Analysis of UFO Sighting

TO: Hq USAF (SAFOI-3c - Major Coleman)

1. FTD has received a letter from [redacted] Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, reporting the sighting of strange lights, occurring over at least a four (4) week period. The information reported is too general in nature precluding a valid conclusion.

2. From the limited information reported, it is possible that one or more of the objects could have been balloons, either large upper-air balloons or smaller weather balloons. Other objects could have been aircraft lights, stars which appeared stationary, or which appeared to move as broken clouds moved with the winds.

3. Due to the fact that this sighting occurred approximately two months ago and did not prompt any other reports to the USAF, FTD does not intend to pursue it further.

Dear Sir:

The letter you will find is the same one I sent to General Mills' Balloon and Aerospace Systems Department in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I received an answer from which read as follows:

"I have read with considerable interest your letter of July 6 in which you describe many strange sights which you saw in the sky in recent days.

Dear Dr. [redacted]:

Your recent letter to the Office of Aerial Phenomena has been referred to this office for reply.

Your descriptions of the objects you saw are too general and lack specific information, thereby preventing a valid conclusion. However, it is possible that one or more of the objects could have been balloons, either the large research type or the smaller radio-sonde and cosmetic types. The larger balloons (over 300 feet) might and 250 feet in diameter) sometimes carry running lights which do not follow the configuration you have seen on aircraft.

Also, aircraft lighting do not always fail. The pilot can select either steady beam or flight, bright or dim. Navigators make it a practice to carry instrument cabin lights on at all times from takeoff till after landing.

Since your sightings occurred approximately two months ago and did not prompt any other reports to the Air Force it is not possible to pursue them further. However, I am enclosing several questionnaires for you to complete following your next sightings. Once you complete them and forward to us, the better chance we will have in reaching a conclusion.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

I might you saw on these following:
cycl that your description does

whether you are aware of the
fact that the U.S. Air Force

call these sights "UFO" or "Unidentified
Flying Objects". Many intelligent and

I hesitate quite a while in
sending this letter on the hope
of getting additional information.

On any clear night now we are able to see some things in the sky which are similar to our previous sighting, very respect except one. They move longer more. It has been explained to me that these things could be stars with air currents causing the flashing, and so they could be, but what about the ones that move up until this year, I have never seen stars with such distinct colors. Each through 7 x 50 binoculars the colors are very distinct.

I would like to add that I have not once seen anything to resemble the thing with so many lights that went over our house.

I hope you have some answer.

Dear Lois:

I am writing to you at the suggestion of our local police, who desire to answer a question which now seems of extreme curious. This about some object we've seen in the sky.

I shall related what four weeks ago. We were watching a thing in the sky which appeared to be a star but was rising red and green. After a long time it started to move from below a war star to the side and in up on the top of it rising very swiftly. I think the market TV station and the Chippewa Falls Police Department getting no explanation. I think to contact the various places.

Finally I got some explanation
from the Eau Claire Police Dept
which satisfied me. An
officer told me that I was more
than likely a weather balloon
expecting a slight movement of light.
I couldn't think of my city in
that duration long enough to
do it, but I left it off that
anyway.

About three weeks later we
saw the same thing in the
same direction, about 9:45
watching it for a while we
started looking around to see if
there were others. Then we
saw what appeared to be the
same type of thing only quite
a way further off in the
opposite direction, about 556
after standing still or about
15 minutes at steadily started
to move very rapidly. We were
all racing it on chasing direction.
