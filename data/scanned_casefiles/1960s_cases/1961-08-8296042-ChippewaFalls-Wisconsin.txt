Text from the image:

To say me is not that it possible. The world has no opinion of mine and has not yet known of our visit. I believe that I cannot tell what we tried as a secret of what we have seen - The secret suggestions that we have are known of each other, and we only represent from a higher representative entity. I do not know all that. They cannot confirm the event with me because we only want truth which is not found to me as a thin truth. They will with which it is certain that some time if they all which is can not say definitely the eventuality's recognition at sometime. It is certainly a mistake if it will not come to me as a message. I will strongly receive it.

Now the sighting took place so what happened is
we were camping at about a 75 angle to the observing
vehicle. The light or object in the air came
from the south and then turn to the east, then we
noticed it appeared to be divided into three distinct
parts, equally spaced, and yet we thought it was not
a real object but seemed to be shaped like an ear of
corn. The light divided and made the three separate
and distinct parts. I can't say much about the color 
except it was not bright or glaring but of a mellow
kind of light and it moved rather slowly in relation
to the speed one would expect of a shooting star or
flare. It was not a conventional object and definitely
not a meteor or flare. We watched it for several min-
utes as it proceeded slowly across the sky moving east-
ward. We are quite certain it was not an aircraft or
any known conventional object. There was no noise
whatsover and the light appeared to be under some
intelligent control as it made an abrupt turn and sep-
arated into three distinct parts. This is the substance
of our report.

As an OCR system, the text in the image is as follows:

"It was about 2:45 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. when I first saw it. I was driving along the road into Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, at the time. It seemed to be about 60 feet up in the air and hovering. At first I thought it was just a bright star, but as I watched it, it seemed to be getting bigger and brighter and changing shape, almost as if it were pulsating. I stopped my car to get a better look at it. As I stood there watching, the object suddenly went straight up in the air at a great rate of speed and disappeared from sight. What I saw was a bright light, almost blinding in its intensity. It did not make a sound and was definitely no airplane or any other craft that I have ever seen. I am at a loss to explain what it was that I saw. It was very unusual and I was quite frightened. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this, even though I am out on the road at night quite often. I have no idea what it could have been, but I know it was not an airplane or any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. It certainly was not a helicopter or weather balloon or anything of that nature. It was simply a bright light that hovered, changed shape, and then shot straight up into the air and disappeared completely. I am quite certain that it was not an optical illusion or my imagination. I have reported this incident to the proper authorities and hope that they may be able to shed some light on what I saw."

This would be the only thing in the sky. So that there would be no other known craft or objects as close at hand. They had no explanation for what they saw. They were a mile and a half from the object. They waited until it left, but did not see it go. They did watch it for about 15-20 minutes. It seemed to be hovering or stationary - whatever you want to call it. They could not estimate the size, as they had no point of reference. They did not hear any noise at all. The object seemed to be glowing or illuminated in some way. That is about all they can tell you. There is a man involved with this report, but we have been instructed not to identify or name any individuals in the images.

Text extracted from the document:

We 55 and we scan
Observed, probe with interest an oblong
Cigar shape in the sky
Craft moving steady in a straight line
Changed direction at will toward horizon
Moved off at a high rate of speed
Observed only a few seconds
Caught the attention of all observers
None of us was able to get a satisfactory explanation 
Unusual but fascinating experience
It seems strange that no one has heard of any other incidents involving such a sighting when presumably an occurrence like this should be of interest toothers in the vicinity
We are all reliable witnesses and respectable community members in our town
Would be pleased to learn of any other sightings similar to what we observed
Have searched local newspapers to no avail
Would appreciate any information you can supply
Thank you for your attention

"it will be noted that at about 4:50 e.m. the assistant was going 
around the yard to see if anything unusual was occurring as she 
had been informed on the previous evening that something might 
take place. As she went around the corner of the garage she heard 
a very strange sound which at first she thought was a car engine 
starting, but as it rapidly increased in volume and intensity she 
realized that it was not a car. She hurried around to the other side 
of the garage to get a better view of what was causing the sound and 
as she did so she noticed a brilliant light in the sky. This light rapidly 
increased in size and brilliance until it seemed to fill the entire
sky. The sound was now so loud that it seemed to make the very air
vibrate. As the light reached its maximum intensity the sound ceased
abruptly. The light then seemed to fade rapidly and disappeared from
view. The entire episode lasted only a matter of seconds. She had the 
impression of a round or oval shaped object which gave off a brilliant
light and which made the most intense sound she had ever heard.
She was greatly startled and frightened by the incident and hurried 
back to the house to inform her husband who was still asleep. She
was so agitated and disturbed that she found it difficult to describe
the incident to him."

Dear Sirs:
The letter you will find is the same one I sent to General Mills Balloon and Research Station, as indicated in paragraph third which read as follows:
"I may be told with considerable interest your letter of September 6 in which you describe many strange sights which you saw in the sky in recent days."
The General Alluminum Company, and Raven Industries, all within a few hundred miles of Minnesota. We inspected the sites of the September 6 sighting. We find that these unexplained sightings have been in the air of this area for some time.
I am making the liberty of returning your letter which you sent to us and I hope you will find success in securing more information regarding this matter. Good luck.
Dear Sirs:
I am writing to you at the suggestion of our local police department to answer a question which has several of us extremely curious. It's about some objects we've seen in the sky.

This page from the Project Blue Book report does not appear to contain a photograph. Based on the text of the document, it seems to be a descriptive narrative of a reported UFO sighting near Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin in 1961.

The text of the document is as follows:

It all started about four weeks ago. We were watching a thing in the sky which happened to be a star and it started to move from below a near star to the side and then go over the top and fall down the other side. Today it had the same thing happen but the motion was reversed. It seemed to start from the bottom and go over the top to the other side. We then got no answer. Finally I got an explanation from the local civilian defense director, who came out there, that it was an experimental rocket or guided missile test from the Twin Cities. Last night was the same thing but apparently it was a different location. I don't think of any city in that direction large enough to do it, but I left it go at that.

About three weeks later we saw the same thing in the same direction, about the same time and it looked the same as before. While we were looking around, somebody said they had heard about some unusual objects down in that direction about six weeks before over the airport. After watching still for about six minutes, it suddenly disappeared from our view as though it had been moved straight up or else the curvature of the earth had hidden it from us. It was a long way and was still moving when we left for home to call somewhere to tell them what we had seen. While talking on the phone in town, my son-in-law called to let me know that it had reappeared again. By this time it had gotten quite a distance off, and when I told him what I thought it might be, a weather balloon too, he said that it only went up and down and not across the sky. No other explanation developed, as he had to make a weather broadcast. We felt that someone on the first night might have listened in to the civil defense unit in Minneapolis, or else the Minneapolis Weather Bureau. My father-in-law mentioned they had seen something unusual in that area four different times over the period of about two hours after the clouds began breaking up. We didn't do anything.

Tonight is the clincher. I looked up to see if there were any such objects, and made another check there were none. Suddenly whatever it was appeared, this time very bright and clear, and started to move very rapidly past the airpark. This led me to get the number of the nearest civil defense unit from the East Claire Police Department. A police officer came out and I told him what we had seen. The officer suggested that I call the civil defense police dept. and described in detail what we had seen. The officer suggested that I call back later to see if they had received any other reports of the object in the north area. I went back out to see if the object was still visible, and by this time it had disappeared, although it probably would have been visible to you. Non-the-less, this is what happened.

I should add that on the first occasion when the object was sighted, it appeared very bright, about 75 feet wide, elliptical in shape and traveled very rapidly eastward across the sky. I thought it was a plane. It seemed to be closer than 1000 feet as it passed. It made no sound. If it had been a plane, it would have made some noise, but there was none. Later that night, the same object was seen for about two hours after the clouds began breaking up. We didn't do anything.

as it seemed, surely we would have heard it.
I went back into the house and phoned for a "squadron" of officers was
amazed when I did receive them and they told me that something in the sky was
so large that it apparently more than blocked out the moon and went into two
schools, its appearance being lighted up with many brilliant lights brighter than the other
star-like objects referred to in the radio report. They claimed they saw it tear across the
sky as they arrived at the school about 12;30 AM and that it was so brilliant they could
see even their shadows, and that it would be the only explanation they could think of, when it seemed to
stop suddenly, hover about the sky, and then slowly disappear. He said they were off the ground. He
said the only way to get to the witness station is about a mile and a half straight ahead and that
they're off the ground. He said the only way to get my sort of course concrete
observations would be to visit the witness myself. I'm afraid I shall have to ask you some more questions.
I'm not sure about all the dates of the sightings, but I started writing
this letter about 6:30 AM on September 5th. There were no visible. As 12:30
they were all gone. On September 3rd we spotted two. About 2 or 3 days before
that they were there again about 3 to 3:30. I hope this information may be of
some help to you. They have been very cooperative.
incidentally, the man at the airport said a woman had called in about an hour
before to report a huge illuminated red green lights. I'm a student at the
Wisconsin State College or Eau Claire. Although I'm not an outstanding scholar,
I believe I did fairly well in meteorology and astronomy courses. The
lights, that I and four others saw, seemed to be far above the atmosphere. The
religious teachings. But frankly, I'm at my wits end. I hope you can help to
unravel this observation which have completely my community.
Another thing I forgot to mention may be merely coincidence, but I'll point
it out to you anyway. The day following the second sighting the following
night, about 2 or 3 in the morning, I turned on the radio and listened to a
sighting the radio carried the story of Russia's test in the atmosphere with
their experimental new rockets. Now it does seem rather strange to me that
almost simultaneously we see these strange objects and then the atmospheric
blast. I'm just wondering what kind of story the radio will carry tomorrow.
Enclosed in a self-addressed stamped envelope. I hope you will send me
your answer as soon as possible. I'm sure there must be some sound explanations
for these happenings.
Thank you.
CHIPPEWA FALLS, WIS.

1. PID has received a letter from 2nd Lt. ... requesting analysis of a UFO sighting reported at Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin on 8 August 1961. The sighting occurred at approximately 11:30 p.m. and was reported to be too general in nature to provide a valid conclusion.
2. The report indicates that the object(s) observed were approximately the size of a baseball, spherical or slightly elongated in shape, and were observed to move as broken clouds moved with the wind.
3. Reports were received about two hours ago and did not establish positional fixes other than the USAF, 7th does not have photograph evidence.

Dear Sir:

This letter you will find is an answer to your general Miller, Ballston and Argyraeus systems. I regret that I missed your call. I received an answer from which a digest of the department follows.

I have read with considerable interest your letter of September 6 which you presented many strange things that occur in the sky in recent years. The Aerial Mail Company has received many reports, like yours, of peculiar objects in the sky, it seems likely that the observations are authentic and possibly merits investigation.

It is entirely possible that the

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter on official Air Force letterhead, addressed to "Mr. Gus Richard", from "WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., MAJOR, USAF, 1424 Information Projects Officer, Public Information Division, Office of Information".

The text of the letter is as follows:

7 November 1961

Dear Mr. Richard:

Your recent letter to the Office of Aerial Phenomena has been reviewed by this office for a reply.

In your letter you make several observations that require some comment. Your sighting is not possible due to the general and well-known characteristics of balloon flights and ground illuminations. The objects could have been either balloons or ordinary aircraft, reflecting sunlight or being illuminated by searchlights at night. In many instances these are reported as "objects" rather than identified with certainty.

Since your sighting occurred approximately two months ago and you did not report it to the Air Force at the time, it is not practicable for us to attempt any further investigation. If you complete them and forward to us, the better chance we will have in reaching a conclusion.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

"I would like you to know that your discovery has been noted and added to my files. 

My department has a keen interest in any phenomena associated with flying objects or strange appearances in the sky. 

Reports by citizens of this country are carefully studied by research groups in this field. Many intelligent and responsible people have seen the flying objects that have been reported over the past few years, and there is no doubt that some of these sightings have been the object of a planned program and vehicles of a mysterious nature. 

Returning your letter, which you wished me to retain, I suggest that you keep a careful record of any additional information of this nature that may come to your attention. Such data is valuable to the continuing study and evaluation of the subject.

Sincerely yours,"

Dear Sirs,

A most interesting letter has come to my attention in the past few days concerning an observation made on the evening of August 6. This observation was made by 2 adults and 3 children who were apparently standing in their yard and observing unusual activity in the sky over Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

According to the information received, these observers spotted what they described as a large circular object, approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter, that was maneuvering in the sky at a relatively low altitude. The object was reported to be emitting a bright light that illuminated the surrounding area. It was stated that the object made several passes over the observers before ascending rapidly and disappearing from view.

I believe this incident warrants further investigation, and I would appreciate it if you could provide any additional details or documentation that may be available regarding this sighting. Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

"Volume, but you are Dandelion family, it seems a long time since we had a meeting or serious discussion about what appears to be a copy of a very interesting eye witness account of a close encounter with a bright light about size of an automobile that passed over a witnesses car and that the witness believed to be moving at a very high rate of speed. Other than that it would be difficult to determine just what the witness could have observed. Some directors are about as worthless as a bricklayer would be at designing an atomic reactor. Of course there are some exceptions. Those who seem to be afraid to rock the boat have no place at all in this work. If we can not be open and honest with ourselves, how can we expect the public to have confidence in what we are doing - and we must have that public confidence, even the skeptics and scoffers. Without it we might as well close up shop. This has been going on for too many years already. We can and must do better."

"This was just about the middle of one course, all of a sudden a light appeared, and seemed to be from a "machine". It remained stationary for a short time and then moved to the north-east at a very high rate of speed. I watched it for a few seconds and then it seemed to disappear. I notified my instructor at the time and he seemed quite interested as well as several other students who had also observed the same phenomena. 
I saw it on 26 Aug 57, about 8:00 pm over Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin."
