AKRON, OHIO
A large, luminous object was observed in the sky which abruptly changed directions and moved away at a high rate of speed on September 13,.... 7:15 pm
The object was described as disc-shaped, luminous white in color, and approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 15 minutes, during which time it did not move continuously but made several abrupt stops and changes of direction. At one point, the object appeared to alternately brighten and dim. Its brightness diminished until it was no longer visible.
The witness stated that it did not make any sound and that if it had been an aircraft of any kind, it would have been identified as such. It was observed to the left and above the witness. The witness was certain that the object and its maneuvers were not characteristic of any known aircraft.
It was further reported that the object was seen by several other persons in the area, and its presence was confirmed by the police. The report indicates that the case was investigated and the object remains unidentified.

COMBAT REPORT (RCS: JCS-C-3065)

The witness was a private citizen residing in the Murfreesboro, Tennessee, area. On the evening of 9 September 1963, at approximately 2030 hours, the witness was outside his home when he noticed a bright light or object in the sky to the north-northwest. The object was shaped like a mushroom and was giving off a brilliant white light. The object seemed to be hovering or floating in the sky, and the light given off by the object was so intense that it seemed to illuminate the surrounding countryside. After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly shot off to the west at a very high rate of speed, nearly disappearing from view. The witness stated that the object's disappearance was very sudden and abrupt, and that it seemed to accelerate to an extremely high speed in the blink of an eye. Attempts to locate further information or witnesses to corroborate this report have been unsuccessful.

UAO'S UPPER TV RECEPTION

Volume 11 of the UFO reports
indicates in May, 1963 that on
the 15th of September, 1962,
several people watched an object "fly
across the sky and disappear over the
trees. This occurred around 7:30 p.m.
on the 15th of September 1962.

Two Airman Tom Looney, 19, said the
object flashing on and off like an aircraft light but it was many times bigger
and brighter and moving slower than a
plane. His friend informed his parents who
in turn informed their parents who spread the
word. A party of six persons journeyed
to Woodside Park Research Society headquarters
to investigate. The following is the
Information related here to Arthur J.
Rodeffer, editor of the Murfreesboro
newspaper reports. 

John Lanner added to his statement:
"The object was traveling in the sky
at a tremendous speed. We all lost it
for a few moments as the haze
covered it. I ran inside to the wife and told
her to come on out, that a flying saucer had just
flown over. When she came out and had a look she changed her
mind."

Doyle Grubbs, a truck driver from South
Nashville, said he was returning home about
that time and while the object was still flashing on and off brightly, the strange object moved over the trees and disappeared. During the 30 minutes it
was about, every TV set in Woodhesll
and South Nashville suffered temporary interference. Some persons reported a double picture, others only
lines and some saw just "snow".

Miss Sylvia Sutton and Judith Milligan
of the Woodhesll area as reported in the
newspaper reports. John Waters, 17-year-old student, saw two objects on Saturday night. One appeared first,
traveling in an arc but not stopping and
the second object came over a little
later and followed the same trajectory.
Des Pugh, 15, saw one object on 24-

They and several of his flam-Ames to
saw one object on Wednesdry, Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday nights. Fence
saw two objects on Saturday night. Mr.
Chris Jolly, retired farmer, saw one
object on Saturday night. All sightingc
were that the time was about tho
same - 8:00 p.m.

Prior to the newspaper reports, at
about 5:15 p.m. on Thursday, 19 Sep
tember 1963, this office received a call
from a man at Mt. Juliet. He described
several sightings by blinking lights trav-
eling in a south to southeasterly direc-
tion. He and his family watched until it
disappeared. This man asked if there
had been any other reports given to
Mrs. Sutton, the lady from whom this
office received the call from his home
on Saturday. South would have been in
the direction in which the objects were
observed. The Weather Bureau, the
Civil Aviation and the Aerospace
Light Aircraft and established that
other aircraft or helicopters were
flying in that area at that time.

Mrs. Sutton also related in her re-
port, when she showed a dismayed object
pass very swiftly near Willow Grove in
Glieson District, there were numerous
sightings in that area when farming op-
erations were interrupted to watch the
passing of the object(s). In the Gippoland
District in Victoria, Australia, there are
reputedly large deposits of uranium and
tin, and the area is regarded as strategic
for the State of Victoria's power needs
because of these minerals. The there
pointed out that UFOs appear to be pre-
occupied with locations of scientific
and industrial importance.

Egg-Shaped Object in Ark.

Mr. Frank Hudson, from his home near Hoxie, Arkansas, made an interesting observation of an egg-shaped object in the sky at 5:55 p.m. CST on September 1, 1963. The object was moving very slowly toward the southeast, about 10 degrees above the southern horizon, and was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object appeared as a bright and steady light. Through binoculars the object appeared as an egg-shaped form. A dark spot near the top or large part of the object, was a dark area which was thought to be the middle part or midway between the two ends. As time passed the object faded and turned to a reddish color before it disappeared. However, a student said the object appeared to be glowing, and the possibility that this object may have been a satellite of some kind has neither been confirmed nor disproved. Hudson has seen similar objects in May 6 and 19, 1963.

The image does not contain any photograph. It is a textual description of a "Bright Sphere Near Home In Me." The text describes an event that occurred on September 24, 1963, where a bright spherical light was seen from the front porch of a Mrs. James Patterson's home near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The light was observed by a total of three people, and the text states that the object disappeared after the witnesses saw the light.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Bright Sphere Near Home In Me.

At about 19:30 p.m. on September 24, 1963, a bright spherical light was seen from the front porch of Mrs. James Patterson's home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Two neighbors, Powell Price, Jr. and R. W. Stumpff, a total of three people witnessed the object when it was first seen, Sherrow, the light quickly disappeared. They saw the light but upon approaching it the object disappeared.

Dear —,

This office is in receipt of the item you recently forwarded us. We are unable to identify any special significance in this matter and are enclosing it for your continued information. The Air Force still believes that this was only an aerial phenomenon and was not any manufactured object of foreign or domestic origin. Some ballistic data seems to indicate there could be a significant amount of time lapse during the initial phase of the observation, and the location indicated is approximately 75 degrees above the horizon.

Sincerely,

CHARLES T. VAN VLIET

The shared image contains a full-page text document with two star charts. The text is written by James Stokley and is titled "Four Planets Appear in Sky". The star charts depict the night sky and label the locations of various planets and constellations.

Text from the document:

Four Planets Appear in Sky
By JAMES STOKLEY
Two backward strolling planets, Jupiter and Saturn, shine in the September evening skies while Mars and Venus, just barely visible, appear low on the horizon.
In the early twilight of that evening, with the color brilliant against the darkening sky, Venus is about 15 degrees above the horizon in the southwest. To the left and higher, Mars, though dimmer, can be seen. Those who look closely may see Jupiter and Saturn farther to the east, about 35 degrees up from the horizon.
In the evening gloom, along with the color-brilliant Jupiter and Saturn, the reddish Mars and the brilliant Venus form an interesting group as they sppear in their slowly changing positions in the sky.
Venus is brighter than any star in the sky at present, shining with a steady white light that immediately catches the eye. It is the brightest object in the evening sky after the Sun. Mars is duller, but still easily seen, more orange in color.
Jupiter, the third brightest of the planet trio, is yellowish-white in color, while Saturn, lower in the sky, is more creamy in hue.
These planets have been in this arrangement in the sky for several weeks, and during the latter part of September they form a more compact group low in the southwest as the evening ends.
In early evening, Venus sets shortly after the Sun, and Mars follows it down over the horizon a little later. But Saturn and Jupiter remain aloft until the morning hours.
Saturn, after September, begins its rapid retrogression - it appears to move westward among the stars. Jupiter also was retrograde earlier, but its westward drift is now becoming more rapid. These two giant planets of the outer solar system provide an interesting celestial spectacle for September skywatchers.

OUTPUT TEXT:

THE FIELDS: Nature's Best Mousetrsp
Mr. Clark's Snapping Bill 
Nature's Best Mousetrsp

This bill was given to me by Mr. Clark of the Tennessee, Murfreesboro Rural Route #2, and is dated August 27, 1963. Mr. Clark said this was given to him by a farmer who had it in his possession for several years. 
This bill which is entitled "The Fields" shows a drawing which indicates the death of someone whose head was partially buried in a field. The bill which is about 9x5 inches in size has a printed message on the reverse side which states in part "To the Tennessee Farmer, whose crops were destroyed by the unwelcome fields mouse, we offer this, our product called 'Nature's Best Mouse Trsp' which we guarantee will absolutely destroy all the mouse population in your field." The bill is signed by F. L. Harrell, President. 
I have no further information on this matter, but it seems to me that this "mouse trap" bill was possibly a cover-up or hoax for some other type of incident. The drawing on the bill appears to be inconsistent with a normal mouse trap. I would appreciate any information you might be able to provide on this particular item.
Sincerely yours, 
Raymond S. Fowler

Kent visitor
The flying object, which is shaped like a flying saucer, was sighted by Mr. Joe T. Blackwell, of 1019 Jones Blvd, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on September 10, 1963. Mr. Blackwell reported that the object was hovering over a wooded area at about 500 feet altitude, and had been observed for about 20 minutes. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, and was silvery in color. It had no visible means of propulsion, and made no sound. After hovering for several minutes, it moved off rapidly over the trees and disappeared from sight.
Mr. Blackwell is president of the R.A.F. at Smyrna, has a good reputation, and is considered a reliable observer. This report is considered genuine by the investigator. The object was not detected on radar.

The text reads:

Southampton mystery
On August 11, 1963, a letter which
attracted widespread attention was
received by the "Daily Mail". This
letter, written in a feminine hand,
stated that during the night of August
9, 1963, a very peculiar object had
been seen hovering over Southampton
Water, and that photographs had been
taken of the object. The writer of the
letter stated that he/she had deliberately
delayed sending the information to the
press until the following day, as he/she
feared that if the information was
released at once, "certain people" might
take steps to prevent it from being
made public. The letter went on to
state that the photographs would be
sent to the "Daily Mail" the next day.
However, the photographs were never
received, and to date no further
communication has been received from
the person who wrote the original letter.

A large meteorite which flashed across the skies of Southern Colorado into daylight Sun on September 3rd was the object of an intense search by scientists, who were hopeful of finding in it fossils that would prove the existence of life on other worlds. Previous claims of fossil finds in meteorites have been doubted or discounted because the meteorites were found long after impact, allowing time for earthly contamination to continue the deception. This one, seen by hundreds of people before it crashed in rugged mountain country, had not been disturbed at last report.

8 September, 1963
Lancashire, England

Lancashire sky puzzle
On the evening of Sunday, September 8, 1963, a married couple who live near Pendlebury, Lancashire, witnessed a strange light in the sky which they described as unusual.
The light appeared at about 8:30pm in the west, just above the horizon, and moving slowly towards the northeast. It seemed to be about the size of a large star, but much brighter. The light also appeared to oscillate up and down slightly as it moved.
The couple watched the light for about five minutes before it disappeared behind trees. They said the light gave an impression of being solid and substantial, not like an ordinary star, and obviously closer than the stars. It seemed to be under intelligent control and did not flicker or twinkle like a star.
The light was definitely not any known aircraft, either civil or military. It moved in a very slow, unconventional manner quite unlike any aircraft. When it disappeared, it simply faded out, rather than going out of sight in the normal way that aeroplanes do.
The couple are reputable people and their evidence is considered reliable. They had no reason to invent or exaggerate what they saw. This phenomenon, whatever it was, has not so far been satisfactorily explained.

Texas Tower Men See Light
Nineteen men aboard Texas Tower IX reported sighting a bright light and smoke in the distance, which appeared to be the nautical equivalent of a flying saucer, a Coast Guard investigation was requested. The Coast Guard sent a plane to investigate, but the object seen by the tower personnel had vanished before the plane arrived. A subsequent search by plane which took over an hour revealed nothing.
The Coast Guard told the State that they, the Tower personnel, say it had a controlled white appearance.
