UFO Observation, 4 November 1967 (four ltr 1 Dec 1967)

589th ACODO
Hanscom AFB, New Hampshire 01301

1. Your letter of 1 December 1967 indicates that you completed an investigation on the unidentified observation of 4 November 1967 near Hanover, New Hampshire. Unfortunately, there is no evidence in your report that the sighting was investigated.

a. Angle of elevation and azimuth of object when first observed, angle of elevation and azimuth of object upon disappearance, description of flight path, manner of disappearance, etc. are necessary part of any report.

b. Weather and wind data were not given.

2. Your comments on the sighting indicated that you had no explanation for the phenomena. It is helpful to our analysis if you would include those areas that you have checked, such as:

a. RADAR PERSONNEL - whether they had any identified or unidentified blips at the time of the observation.

b. CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL - statement as to whether the control tower operator observed anything unusual at the time of the observation.

c. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES - Often, they can provide information as to the reliability of the witness. Also, they may have received a UFO report, or additional information they provide you with the stimulus of the observation.

3. It is important that you provide the above information so as to not duplicate your investigation. Since we are trying to close out 1967 cases we would like this information as quickly as possible.
