The same morning June 24, I discussed this further with Chief Radarman Warren Nielsen, Ret., who lives on Washington Island but teaches Radar in the East during the school year. He explained some of this phenomena, (the buoy from the Escanaba area), as the bending of light rays over the water as a possibility.

During the day we also heard a report of a huge barn fire in the Sturgeon Bay area which also is some distance to the south over open water. Whether this accounted for the fire-like sighting on water level I have no idea.

On Friday June 25, 1965 Mr. Nielsen heard over the news on radio from Marinette, Wisconsin that an additional similar sighting had been reported at 2230 Thursday June 24 in the area of Escanaba, Michigan. That same evening, June 25, I called the Escanaba Coast Guard Station inquiring of EM/1C Silver about later sighting on Thursday PM (June 24). He had not heard about this and suggested I call Truax Field and report my sighting, which I did immediately. Your Lt. Patterson requested that I file this report which I am submitting forthwith.

Following this call I had a chance meeting in the village of Washington Island with the Specialist 1/C and his Chief from the Plum Island Coast Guard with whom I had talked on Thursday AM at the time of the initial sighting. Both he and the Chief, my wife and I discussed this further. The Chief said they had searched the area in small craft during the daylight hours of the day I made my report, Thursday June 24, to no avail. All was reported in the log book on Plum Island, according to the Chief. I told them of my conversation to Truax Field.

We have made an attempt to sketch the objects as seen, plus the slides enclosed for your evaluation. We have also enclosed maps of Washington Island are and of the whole Door County area, for your information.

In closing I would like to give my interpretation of what this could have been.
This would appear to be a spacecraft, approximately 100 ft. long x 20 ft. in diameter with
flat ends. From the apparent individual actions of the lesser objects it would seem to
be some kind of homing (?) and/or monotoring device launched from above.
If we can be of further service please contact us.

We are both in good health, both have good vision, and for the purpose of the
sightings our naked eyes served very well,

Yours very truly,

The season begins with the perch run about mid-April, just as the ice leaves the harbors. Northern Pike, Rock Bass and Small Mouth Bass till the fisheries fine spring through autumn in the natural spawning grounds of this area.

The harbors and forests are great places to explore. For the nature lover, the woods abound with wild flowers, a variety of song birds, animals and wild game. An added dividend is finding the rare Calypso Orchid - LOOK but don't TOUCH! Because deeply - it's FOREST ART!

From childhood, the natives are taught conservation and take pride in the Scandinavian Festival in August. Islanders are noted for their delicious cooking as exemplified at Smorgasbord - time. Should you miss the annual festival, the Scandinavian Dances are offered for your entertainment on Thursday evenings at 8:30.

Gorgeous foliage, migrating birds and cool crisp nights make September and October ideal vacation months for those seeking perfect rest.

Potato Harvest season presents its own wonders as everyone joins in the picking.

A fresh snowfall over Washington Island is a sight you will long remember.

On the island, you will experience a warmth of friendliness, so rare in the hustle and bustle of city life. Symbolic of Scandinavian hospitality is the huge coffee pot near the ferry dock, handpainted with the Norwegian inscription "COFFEE IS THE BEST OF ALL EARTHLY DRINKS".

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

23 Oct 65
Mr [redacted] Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Mr [redacted] noticed a shadow on the negative.

Mr [redacted] had called the Coast Guard. Called Escanaba and filed a report to Madison. He understood that there was another report in the area. He was out on Washington Island and there was no breeze.

Mr [redacted] said this thing appeared North-Northwest about 10,000ft. from an unscientific approach. It was travelling Northwest-after 10 seconds it started down. The whole thing lasted in the area of 15 to 30 minutes including the phone call to the Coast Guard.

He was facing West. The thing came out of a right angle. Approached him 1/2 to 1 mile or 1½ mile - came at him about 5 to 8 seconds. There was quite a loud roar. Sounded as if he were near 50 to 60 feet from a jet motor. At the point it was still hovering he called the Coast Guard.

Triangular flare - 2 degrees to 3 degrees to the left - good 200 yards - facing West. The object swooped South and to the East-hovered 2 degrees to 6 degrees to the left and 1 or 1½ straight in front of him. He was a flare to the immediate right pointing North bound. The following day one of the fairies was crippled. This fairlie had hit something of a submerged nature.

Director of Intelligence, O. I. C.
Truax Field, Wisconsin

Subject: U. F. O.

To Whom It May Concern:

After much preparation, film developing and discussion with my wife, 

I wish to report the following sighting on the morning of June 24, 1965 at approximately 0235 to 0255 at Sunset Resort, West Harbor Area, Washington Island, Door County, Wisconsin. We were vacationing in the area.

At this time and prior, I had been observing the heavy star cover with 7 x 35 binoculars, also chanced a possible shot with a Rikon 35mm camera with flash by laying same on ground, wide open 30 ft. to infinity, 1/25 second setting. I hoped that I might capture in silhouette some adjacent cedar trees. #10 slide is the result with stars only visible.

At approximate hours mentioned above I observed a bright orange cylindrical object in the direction of Gills Rock to the Southwest. Slide #19 pinpoints the area at intersecting orange lines. The object was proceeding in a N-NW direction, at approximately 10,000 (?) feet. From the 5 to 10 seconds or so that I observed this until the following occurred, it appeared to be decreasing speed, (near stop condition). At this time the object (clearly visible with naked eye), spewed a pod of five or six lesser objects from the forward end, simultaneously scattering in various directions, one of which arched in my direction and came straight in. No exhaust was visible from any of above at any time. I lost sight of main object as this whitish smaller object approached me, turning to bright orange as it got closer.

This lesser object came to a near stop position and hovered over the Green Bay area pinpointed by intersecting blue lines also on Slide #19.


- page 17 -

From launch to hover position approximately 5-8 seconds. This lesser object now bright orange, emitted a sound similar to rocket (a roar) as opposed to a jet, e while), continuously. Upon putting the field glasses on same, the orange solid mass seen with naked eye appeared as a circular orange mass with rapidly oscillatin vertical electrical waves; three or four multi-colored.

This orange mass filled up most of the outer lenses of the glasses thus its assumed short distance away (1/2 to 1 mile).

At this time I awoke my wife who confirmed the above through the glasses.

While we were observing the above, the following was also observed at water level approximately 1/2 mile to the right of the arm of land (north) as seen on slide #19. Directly west of the Resort where we were staying and just south of a red marker buoy presumable from the Escanaba area there appeared a large bright orange bonfire shaped (▲) flare at water level. This area is pinpointed on slide #18. You will note there are no islands in the area, no arm of land and Escanaba is approximately 48 miles Northwest. During all this, I attempted with to capture all on film.

Slides 11 and 12 though framed appear blank, at least through held viewer and slide projector. Perhaps specialized equipment at your disposal can see something on these or #13 and #14 which came back unmounted. #13 and #14 DO have silhouettes visible at an angle to the eye with daylight and magnifying glass although nothing shows on the projector. These slides could prove the best results of this sighting.

At approximately 0300 I called the Coast Guard Station on Plum Island and reported some detail of the sighting to the Petty Officer on duty, assumedly while the foregoing was still in progress. He checked the radar scope while I waited at the phone and reported nothing, and said than that he would enter our conversation in the log book. After my call, I no longer could see anything further (about 10-15 minutes later, and it was getting light so I retired.
