SUBJECT: Radar UFO Sightings (U)

TO: TDEW (TSgt Moody)

On 14 July 65, radar targets on the scope were evaluated, and it is the opinion of this office that the targets are real and in all probability are high-altitude balloons. This analysis is based on the following facts:

a. The speeds of the targets (indicated only once) are too low aircraft and are typical for high-altitude balloons.
b. The altitudes of the targets are too high for normal aircraft, but are readily attainable by high-altitude balloons.
c. It is understood that at least two high-altitude balloons had been lost just previous to the radar sightings.

This page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a report describing a sighting of an object over Findlay, Ohio that was detected on radar. The report provides details about the object's size, speed, and altitude, as well as the timeline of events and the communication between the various personnel involved. The text of the report is as follows:

Sgt Gross from Bellfountain AS called on 14 Jul 65. He may be reached on ext 121 or 214. He is confused on how the following should be handled: 
Bellfountain received a call last night from Radio Station at Lima, a man had observed an object over Findley, Ohio a few minutes later Bellfountain's radar picked one object up on radar, then lost contact, regained contact for 18 minutes. He called Duty Officer, Maj Teasgarden at Lockbourne. One hour later they had a call from Lima radio who had an eyewitness account on tape. Bellfountaine arranged a conference call with Lockbourne and while Lima played tape Lockbourne made a recording of it. After this Bellfountaine had two objects on radar. Duty Officer will not be on duty until midnight tonight and he is confused as to what type of report should be made.
They had no scope photos as they had no scope camera. Please advise this afternoon, 14 Jul 65, what action they should take.
Maj Quintanilla spoke with Sgt Gross and was satisfied that the object sighted over Findley, Ohio was not the same as on radar. Radar objects would not be reported as a UFO. Told him he should forward a report through TO ADC. The object at Bellfountaine at 0505Z, 14 Jul for one minute, 62,200 ft, it traveled four miles and at 0552Z made another contact, traveled 60 miles in 15 min... 73,000 ft went up off scope which was above 75,000 ft. At 0604Z until 0655Z had two objects at 84,500 till 95,800 ft. This information was also given to Major Quintanilla by Sgt Bruce from SAC Command Post at Lockbourne.
