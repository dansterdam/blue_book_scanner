11. COMMENTS
Motion contrary to satellite observation
in view of JW heading. Object was
observed at azimuth of 240 deg.
Motion to S could have been interpreted
as moving away from observer and
related to a westerly component.
Obj may have been moving SE instead.
In view of pilot's belief that
object was satellite case carried as
such. ATIC schedules not available.
