27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

We had been invited to talk with a Girl Scout group on stars/constellations, but on early fog blotted out the sky at the time set.

Shortly after, the sky overhead cleared, the moon was visible and we decided to do some star gazing by ourselves. Mars, Arcturus, Pleiades were visible as well as the Big Dipper.

It was when we turned to the north that the object caught our attention. We have seen weather balloons, but they didn't move in the North-West, South direction as this did. We have seen satellites, but their movement was slower and in a straight course. It turned to the same place and lined the sky about the same time on several nights thinking that this might be a scheduled object, but we did not see it again.

TDPT (USO)
UFO Observation, 25 July 1969

Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]
Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania 15845

The description you have provided of your UFO sighting of 25 July 1969 is similar to others we have received of Garment Bag Hot Air Balloons (see attached description). However, since surface and upper air wind observations are not available for the area in question, this is only a tentative evaluation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Gentlemen:

We would appreciate your help in identifying an object we observed in the sky Friday, July 25 at about 10:00 P.M.. We think it must have been a weather balloon but we are puzzled about the direction it was moving.

My husband and I were observing stars in an open field along Route 646 between Johnsonburg and Ridgway Pennsylvania. There had been heavy showers earlier in the evening, but at the time, the moon was shining and overhead some of the larger stars were visible.

The object first attracted our attention in the north, just below Mizar in the Dipper-- probably 45° above the horizon. It appeared spherical, shining with a steady, blue-white light. It was larger than any satellites we have watched and its apparent speed was faster.

It moved silently towards the west at the altitude of Arcturus, then bore to the south until we lost sight of it in the light of the moon which was much diffused by a rising ground fog. During its course, it made several slight, sudden changes in direction without changing its speed. We have not seen it again although we have returned to the same spot at about the same time of night a number of times.

We have delayed reporting our observation because we hoped to come upon some information that would make this inquiry unnecessary.
