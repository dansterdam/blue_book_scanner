This is a reply to your letter reporting an aerial object.

We have reviewed the information you submitted concerning an observation on 24 June 1965. At 10:15 pm on this date, you were visible in a field near your home. If the time you stated is correct, you probably saw the planet Venus. It was visible in Daylight Saving Time instead of Eastern Standard Time. If the time you mentioned is correct, another possible explanation of your sighting.

(written at New Germany
Recreation Area,
Savage River State Park,
Grantsville, Md.)
July 2, 1965

Gentlemen:

I wish to report the following sighting, which I recently experienced.

LOCATION OF VIEWER: On the Lower New Germany Rd., about 4 mi. South of U.S. Route 40 - this location would be approx. 10/10 mi. S.E. of Grantsville, Md.

DATE & TIME: Sunday night June 27 approx. 11 pm, or a few minutes earlier

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: Object had the general size, color, & brilliance of a medium-size star - somewhat brighter, whiter, and steadier in brilliance than a star.

PATH & DIRECTION: Object followed a seemingly straight course, with no perceptible tilt bearing, that took it almost directly overhead of my position; course followed was approximately west to east.

Baltimore 9, Maryland

RATE OF TRAVEL: The object passed through approximately half (or 90°) of the overhead heavenly arc of 180°, in a period of 5 to 10 minutes. When I first noticed it, was about 25°-30° west of a point directly overhead; when I stopped observing it was about 55° west of point directly overhead. I had no way of estimating height of object, but my impression was that object was at least several miles high, and perhaps very considerably higher.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: Brilliantly clear.

Re: OBSERVER: Sober. I stopped my car (Convertible, with top down) on this fairly high mountain road, to enjoy the view, looked at the heavens, and noticed object:

Will appreciate a reply to this letter, advising me of object sighted in a known weather balloon, satellite, etc.

Sincerely,

[Signature and identifying information redacted]
