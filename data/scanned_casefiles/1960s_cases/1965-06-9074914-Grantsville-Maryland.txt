There is no photograph present in this scanned document from Project Blue Book. The image is a handwritten report describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

RATE OF TRAVEL: The object passed through the air at a very high rate of speed, much faster than a conventional aircraft. The observer estimated the object's speed to be around 500 mph.

APPEARANCE: The object appeared to be silvery or shiny in color and considerably higher in the sky than the observer initially thought. The observer had no way of estimating the exact height, but their impression was that the object was at least several miles high, and perhaps considerably higher.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: The weather was brilliantly clear at the time of the sighting.

OBSERVER: The observer was a sober, reliable person who reported the sighting in a straightforward manner. The observer would appreciate any response or explanation regarding the object they observed, which they described as being similar to known weather balloons, satellites, etc.
