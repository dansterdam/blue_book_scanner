1. (UNCLASSIFIED) N/A

k. 

(1) A check with FAA, NORAD/SEADATS and Alaskan NORAD Region Combat Center (ANRCC) failed to reveal any known or unknown unclassified sightings or ESUS that could account for the sightings. In addition the possibility that an unidentified electronic was seen in the discovered because a check with BAR and FTM ESM line sectors reveal that no radars were out during the time of the sighting, plus our winds 30 minutes. The Arctic Ice Island reported negative balloon releases for this period.

(2) A check with SAC/Eielson and the ATWG Liaison Officer revealed no U-2 aircraft were flying in the Mackenzie Bay area between 31/1300Z and 31/1300Z March.

k. Capt W. T. Wilson,

Possible Explanation: After a high altitude weather balloon with white light or a classified ESV. Due to the high elevation of the object, ESV is believed more likely of the two.

2. (UNCLASSIFIED) This report is classified _______ because it reveals _______ close unclassified operations.

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for February 24, 1962

Springtime Stars Appear
With the arrival of March, new groups of stars typical of the spring season appear in the east before the winter constellations are out of view, James Stokley reports.

WITH THE COMING of March the evening skies reflect the lengthening arrival of spring. This occurs, in the Northern Hemisphere, on Tuesday, March 20, at 9:30 p.m. EST (6:30 PST, 7:30 MST and 8:30 PST). At that moment the sun, which has been moving northward in the sky since last December, will be directly over the equator.

In the evening, the familiar winter constellations are still on view, although destined soon to be replaced by the western horizon. New constellations are becoming prominent in the east.

These are shown in the accompanying maps, which depict the skies as they look about 10:00 p.m. your own local time, at the beginning of March; and your earlier or the middle of the month, depending on how early or late you get an early.

In addition, planets are returning to view. Earlier than last year at this time that are visible to the naked eye or with a small telescope. Mars could not be seen very easily. But now Venus has moved to the east, so it remains in the western sky for a little while after sunset. By the end of March it will be more than an hour behind the sun; you will be able to see it as a brilliant star very low in the west after sunset.

In Morning Sky
And, in the morning sky, Jupiter and Saturn are making their appearance low in the east before sunrise. At the first of March Saturn rises about an hour and a half ahead of the sun, and by the end of March 31, it is equal to a first magnitude star in brightness. Jupiter, even more brilliant, comes up a little later—about an hour before the sun at the end of the month.

As for the stars of the March evening sky, the bright stars are in the brightest skies in the southwest. In Canis Major, the big dog. Above it is Canis Minor, the little dog, with the bright star called Procyon. Still higher are the twin, Gemini, and to the right of Canis Major is Orion.

To the right from Canis Major is Orion, the various, with two stars of the first magnitude. Betelgeuse is above and Rigel below. Between them is the row of three fainter stars that form Orion's belt. And further to the right stands Taurus, the bull, with the bright red star Aldebaran, a ruddy red in color. Above this group is Auriga, the charioteer, in which Capella shines brightly.

These are constellations that were prominent on winter evening; those on spring.

Here is the text from the document:

bright star called Canopus. This is the second brightest star of the migitating sky, exceeded only by Sirius, it can be seen from the southern stars. When Sirius is on the meridian (i.e., directly south) as it is in March at an earlier hour than the times for which the maps are drawn, Canopus is almost directly below it.

                                        RECENT NEWS STORIES

BIG SAUCER "FLAP" IN SOUTH AMERICA: A sensational series of saucer sightings has been taking place recently in Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay. This "flap" has apparently been going on more or less continuously at least since July, when our already large coverage to include South America as well as the United States. The more sensational sightings are as good as or better than those in the U.S. Southeast during November 1957. Of the many dozens of reports we have received, lack of space prevents us from giving you more than a few of the most interesting ones. It is of special interest to note that the "flap" has been almost completely ignored by the U.S. press and the only worthwhile report is an English news clipping from a Rutland, Vermont newspaper, dated November 17th. An authentic-looking UFO photo is included, but is too poor in photographic quality to reproduce here. With the picture is the following story:

Louis Moyers of Brattleboro, Vermont, received a letter from a long-time friend in Cordoba, Argentina. Two Italian exchange students at the University of Cordoba had the opportunity of taking pictures of a UFO. Both were building a T.V. antenna on the roof of their home when they saw a shadow. It was about noon and the sky was clear. When they looked up, they noticed a disc-like object, approximately 1,700 feet above them. The object hovered for 10 minutes or so, during which time they took their pictures. The UFO then departed. Leaving a dark red trail, this incident occurred back in March of this year. Unfortunately, the complete story is not available, but it is apparent from the letter and picture that the saucer was seen in more detail than the vast majority of sightings.

Bolten revisited

In the Manchester Guardian, 1962, issue, the FLYING SAUCER review published a critical review of the action in connection. The article by Nigel Calder was over-flying Wigan and was describing a new sighting over this town.

A bystander couldn't believe his eyes. He was standing near a lamp-post, watching something hovering over the town. Went at 6 per. [JAAFH]

"I gazed at it for several minutes as it hovered. In the sky. It appeared slightly tilted. But I could see the shape was not a disc but appeared to be a dark, silvery thing."

"Jane made a quick sketch of the saucer, and her drawing was like the conventional bulging disc."

When Jane told me about it, I thought at first that it was a figment of her imagination, and I questioned her father, Mr. Maurice Barnett, of 9 Greenhalgh Lane.

"But I questioned her at considerable length, and I am quite sure she must have seen something. It wasn't a hoax or anything like that."

On March 9, 1962 a pear-shaped UFO was photographed over Lieui, Hawaii by a newspaper reporter.
