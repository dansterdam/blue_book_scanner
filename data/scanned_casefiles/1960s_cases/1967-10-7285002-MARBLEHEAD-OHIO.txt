At that time the local papers carried a story that Mr. Warren Myers, 7005 E. Bay Shore Road, Marblehead, Ohio, had sighted unusual objects in the area.

We are not aware whether planes or blimps were in the area at the stated time, although the local air-port is only 5 miles west of the Myers home.

REPORT ON UFO SIGHTING

October 13, 1967.        10:20 am   MDT    On Colo Hwy 96 W of Ordway
Elev. 4500 ft.           Road bearing S, 50 deg W. Inclined to SW 10
deg from N horizon.      Sky clear & blue overhead.    High flight
clouds to far north & south.    Slight haze in Arkansas R. valley.    Mts
to west. (about 60 miles) dark & clear against a clear sky.

I went around a slight curve where Hwy 96 straightened out on a long
stretch of a few miles.    Down this length, at a low level, was a dull
shaped object.    Color was dull aluminum.    There were occasional flashes
of bright light.    Shape resembled two pie plates with edges together
but top & bottom quite rounded.    The object was visible down the stretch
of pavement, but slightly left of the center.    Vertical angle was low,
almost zero as the object was visible against the lower part of the
mountain range west of Pueblo, actually the Wet Mountain I was looking
almost directly toward the area where several UFO have been reported
in the San Luis valley.

Because of this I made careful notes of all conditions that
might have any bearing on the sighting.    As I drove SW at a speed of
about 50 mph I watched the object instantly and constantly.    As it
remained within this lines of the right of way I could do this safely.

I estimated the distance as possibly a few miles at most.    The
object appeared to be approaching me at a fairly light speed.    By noting
the perspective narrowing of the pavement and estimating the distance I
assessed the diameter of the object at 50 to 100 feet.

As it approached it maintained a remarkably constant elevation
but it seemed to sway slightly horizontally.    However it definitely
remained in view above the pavement, slightly left of center, as if
it was following the road.    I watched it for many seconds and it
was approaching rapidly.

Suddenly the aluminum color and the flashes of light disappeared
in a split second.    Instantly the color changed to a dark, almost black,
and the size decreased to a fraction of the first appearance.    I realized
it was very close and moving swiftly.

I slowed down to about 20 mph and watched the dark object
closely.    It began to move in higher, or the vertical angle was increasing.
I could see that it soon would be above me.

Suddenly it was just above me.    I stopped and looked out of
my truck window.

The LEO was 3 brown insulators on a guy wire between two
power line poles, one on each side of the highway.    The 3 insulators,
in tandem, were slightly left of the center of the road.    They were
perhaps 12 inches total length overall and about 16 feet above the
pavement.    Brown ceramic with a high polish.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

ON THE 20TH OF OCT. I WAS CALLED OUT SIDE BY MY WIFE TO SEE AN OBJECT THAT PASSED OVER THE HOUSE. I SAW THE OBJECT DISAPPEAR IN THE S.E. AT APPROX. ANGLE OF SPEED UPWARD AT APPROXIMATELY 60° ANGLE FROM THE HORIZON. ON THE 21ST OF OCT. AT APPROXIMATELY 6:45 P.M. I HAD ADJUSTED AND SIGHTED IN THE CITY OF SANDUSKY WHICH IS APPROX. 15 MILES AWAY WITH MY 10-50 POWER BINOCULARS. MAKE OF BINOCULARS PROBABLY JAPANESE, NAME OF BINOCULARS DIAMOND - 10X50 - # 12581 - 262 FT AT 1000 FT.

THE OCT. 21, 1967 SIGHTING WAS MADE USING EYE GLASSES ALONE. I IMMEDIATELY PICKED UP THE OBJECT WITH MY BINOCULARS BUT HAD TO READJUST THE BINOCULARS FOR A CLEARER VIEW OF THE OBJECT. (SEE)
