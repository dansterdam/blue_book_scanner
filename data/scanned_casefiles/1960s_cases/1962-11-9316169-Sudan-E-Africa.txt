Dear Sirs:

I thought you might be interested in a strange phenomena we witnessed over-head on the 1st of this month. Also, perhaps, you could give us some information or explanation of what we saw. I shall try to explain it.

About 7:30 p.m. we noticed what at first seemed like a small cloud arise in the West. It gradually worked its way overhead, then seemed to change course and go Northeast, it gradually disappeared from view, though it had only gone a little ways North. From the time we first saw it until it disappeared was a time lapse of possible twenty minutes.

It was a round mass, much like a cloud and stayed together. The night was clear and starry with a silver of moon. To get an estimate of size we held up a 6 inch saucer and moved back to where we could see it just covered the mass. From where we stood to the same view we could see it had no idea of the height of the formation, though it was much higher than clouds and appeared somewhat like a moon though it did not retain one constant shape. As far as colour it appeared almost as colourless, or a smokey silver.

The sun had set at about 5:30, our time, which would be 1530 GMT., thus was two hours down when we first noticed the "cloud". I supposed that it was travelling Eastward around the earth and as it came overhead was getting out of the rays of the sun, hence was disappearing to our view, but why would it appear to travel north before it disappeared?

Could this have been the "cloud" formed by water that was released by you in one of your tests? That seems the most logical explanation, however, we wondered if it could have been a mass of radioactive fallout from a recent test? It did not disintegrate when disappearing, the last we saw of it still retained the same size and shape.

We are missionaries in the Republic of Sudan, situated about 10 degrees above the Equator.

The reaction of some of the local people was somewhat humorous. Some thought it was a "spirit" of some kind and were scared out of their wits. Many came running to ask what it was. We'd like to be able to tell them definitely, if you would have any ideas.

Thank you very much,

Sincerely yours,
