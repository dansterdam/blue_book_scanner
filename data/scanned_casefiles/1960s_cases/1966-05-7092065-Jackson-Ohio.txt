Dear Sirs,

The object in drawing no. 1 I saw through my bedroom window down to the 2nd object is what I saw when I went outside to pick up the trail of the first object.

If I had remained inside at my window I would have seen the 2nd object 22 ft. closer. However it would have been going faster.

If I am correct thinking you would probably be most interested in the first object. It was hovering with its big end toward me. Within seconds it made a move, which would

Be: described in one of three ways. (1) it had a blinksky or (3) hostile. It headed directly down and forward in my direction. Actually it stopped three times -- moved closer -- stopped -- jerked again -- moved closer -- stopped -- jerked again -- moved closer -- stopped.

If it had turned -- moved broadside it can I could have given you a more detailed drawing. But instead it went in reverse and up a little higher so quickly that it looked like a small balloon closing upward a few feet.

Nope, it went up and to the right -- down and to the left -- etc. again it moved -- the small

end swing around and the Ray and Bitted.
At this point I went into the next room to let my brother in on the big event. We returned to the window and door looked the circling dot. My brother didn't seem interested in the swirling dot. I made a few remarks about John Glenn and had being up there and left my room.
Next this object made a high rising movement and sped away toward the northeast. It was now just a pinhead of light moving quickly but I went outside dizzyhead. I already told you what I saw outside. It was like silvery white.
I'm no pilot. They're screwy shots or they were pulling my leg.

P.S. I told my him, etc. that I saw a W.D. but I didn't give them the details. I don't think they would like to know in this house. Perhaps myself. I have a little trouble myself.

Dear Sir,

If the object I saw outside was 6' wide and 15' high then the moon was 18' wide. I watched it for some time. The size of that moon, & he moon was growing been side large.

That moon wasn't round. Its sides didn't bulge. I was outside from 9:15 pm until the after mid of night talking to the relatives. If there were meteors we saw it as we were outside. I was just a few.

I'm not able to keep an eye 2 moon while most maps cut some time between now (and) it's wide and 13 1/2 wide and 15 high.

Sincerely,

The document appears to be an envelope with a postmark from Jackson, Ohio dated August 26, 1966, addressed to a military address at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. There is also a "Via Air Mail" stamp with wings on the envelope.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Note that there is a black redaction bar covering some text in the middle of the document.

On the right side of the page, there appears to be some additional text that is partially cut off or illegible, which seems to read:

The document also contains a hand-drawn sketch/diagram of what appears to be a rectangular object with some internal divisions or details.

Dear Sir,

[The rest of the text is partially illegible. Some words can be made out, but not the full content of the letter. The handwriting is cursive and somewhat faded, making complete transcription difficult.]

The text begins with "Dear Sir," and then continues with text that is not fully clear. Some words are discernible, but a complete and accurate transcription cannot be provided due to the illegibility of the document.


- page 18 -

The text I can read on this page is:

"Pole at home
inside it..."

The rest of the text is illegible. The image appears to be a hand-drawn technical sketch or diagram of some kind of structure or framework, with horizontal and vertical lines and some small circular elements.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[First few lines are partially illegible]

Some words are difficult to read due to the image quality, so I've noted where text is unclear or partially missing.

[First line is partially illegible]

There is also a hand-drawn circular sketch/diagram in the center of the page, with some additional text near it that appears to say "Miles altitude" or something similar.

The text is handwritten and somewhat difficult to read in parts, so some words are uncertain or missing.


- page 21 -

From the image, I can partially read a circular stamp/mark that appears to say:

JACK
1966
AUG 9

There are also some vertical lines/hash marks at the top left of the document. Most of the page appears to be blank white/gray space. A faint curved line/coffee ring mark is visible near the center of the page.

The text in the circular stamp is partially illegible, so I have only transcribed the parts I can confidently read.

I've figured it out. You've probably known it's all along.

I sent you two drawings thinking what I had seen different objects.

The second object was merely, she electrified small end of the first object.

I know what she lighting effects are controllable. Because of the way it did spread.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 1st object shud off some flight when it changed from lot to pinhead.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
It moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound    None
b. Color    Silver-white, yellow-white between ends

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? It is 2½ times as long as it is high if it is seen. These don't believe that it was much bigger than a helicopter.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
