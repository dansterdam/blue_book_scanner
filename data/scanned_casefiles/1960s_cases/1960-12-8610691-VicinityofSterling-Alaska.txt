10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Size changed. Alternating red, green and white. Appeared and disappeared 60° SE side of Mars. Pulsating movement side to side, up and down and slow circles, returning to original position. Some movement 10-15 min later. Clouds obliterated object to SE.

11. COMMENTS
Object was visible for 45 min, then it was obscured by clouds. The only movement noticed was an apparent tip and down, side to side movement, which was probably due to this crisp cold atmosphere. The bright star Arcturus was in the vicinity proper for the object, and was probably the object observed.

☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical Arcturus
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
