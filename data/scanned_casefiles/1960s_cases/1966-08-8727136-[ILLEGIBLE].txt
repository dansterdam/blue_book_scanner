Dear Mr.

Reference your unidentified observation of 21 August 1966. Analysis on your sighting has been completed and we believe you and other witnesses observed one of the many visible satellites that are now in orbit around the earth.

According to the Star Catalogue there are at least thirty satellites and satellite components which are visible to the naked eye. The length of time for which these satellites are visible varies with the the altitude at which they are orbiting the earth. This debris in the skies is increasing at a steady rate and has accounted for many of the recent "ancer sightings". All space vehicles and components follow regular paths. To naked-eye observers, the motion of a bright artificial satellite consists of tiny zig-zags rather than a smooth curve across the sky. This familiar illusion has been ascribed "to the fact that we do not move our eyes continuously, but in little jerks".

Because of the large amount of space debris in orbit, it is extremely difficult to determine the actual object that was viewed.

Thank you for reporting your observation with detailed information.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Unidentified Flying Object

Hq FFD (TDFC)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. Following incident reported to FFD's "Man in Saigon", 23 August 1966:
marine pilot flying at 15,000 feet altitude at a position 240 degrees and
30 nautical miles from Da Nang, NVN, observed a sausage like form with
lights along the side. The object approached the aircraft on a collision
course - turned and flew parallel to the aircraft for about three minutes -
then suddenly veered north and vanished.

2. Review of the sparse information available reveals similarity to pre-
vious instances recorded occurring in the United States. Observation pos-
sibly caused by reflection of pilot's own aircraft from clouds or other
air masses. Perturbations in an air mass many times cause what appears to
be radical maneuvers.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

When I saw these lights I thought that maybe it was an signal flare. Then my imagination began to get all sort of things. After getting a reasonable grip on myself I could briefly say it was a "watched like a plane falling".

I didn't want really anything to do with it or about it at first I am concerned. But, the only reason I did tell you about this is that I was afraid that there might be someone over these who are in troubles, needed help. My imagination had a clear picture of shooting off flares to attract help.

This "low thing" wasn't a plane, a space ship, or anything else in the place area. It was just a light.

I feel now that my call probably should have been directed to the highway patrol or the local sheriff, because I feel I've got you all to a lot of trouble over a light feeling.

Nevertheless, thank you for being interested.

After it went back the object just hovered there, then three disks appeared around the object (which we finally noticed was a cigar like shape).

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My 12 year old son called to me as he came from a baseball field to come and see what this was. I was in my kitchen decorating a cake and George Butler (park ground director) who stays also at the table. I went out, saw the object and called George. My son ran and got his binoculars and George and Daniel viewed it through them. I could not adjust the binoculars to my glasses.

We watched it moving around for about 10 minutes (maybe) and there was a small light bobbing around on the side of it. It seemed to be trying to connect up or capture the smaller one. Then it flashed a long streak of light on fire toward the small one and they became connected up. When this flash of light went out the lights in the home and street went out. We lighted a candle and learned the next day (by my electric clock being behind) that it was probably off 15 minutes. After the flash of lightning or fire the object went off toward the west (toward Cass) real fast. I do not feel this is my kind of

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I answered the questions from what is saw of the objects. David said that before his mother and I came out the lights had moved very fast and then apart and then consolidated back into two lights. There were only two lights when I was observing. The lights drifted towards us in a southerly direction at a constant speed (not fast). They got almost directly over us and hovered for a few seconds and started drifting off to the West. One light moved back and forth around the other light. The more stationary one seemed to stay in a constant path. Sparks darted from one light to the other. I seemed like mainly from this light that was moving around the constant moving light. There were as many as five at one time. They was a light haze encircling the two lights. As they started drifting Westwardly, one of us watched somewhat brighter than the other and at that time (probably just a coincidence) the lights went through what looked like a cloud. Lights through the circulars as they were just starting to drift to the West. Surely walked through them for two or three minutes.

Dear Sirs:

August 15th, 1966
Hollytree Terrace
357 Clinton
6N 203

On August 9th, about 9:30 p.m. I observed an object in the sky. This was just south by the McPherson County State Lake (Kansas) This appeared to be in a group of stars and was stationary for at least forty minutes. I had studied the stars for that long. It suddenly moved eastward and continued at the same speed until out of sight (about eight minutes).

Since this was very high and stayed stationary for so long a time I decided it should be reported. Sincerely,

[Name redacted], Kandar

The object was there when I retired. I had observed the sky for at least 40 minutes when this object suddenly spread away from it's nearest star. It started and continued at the same speed to the east. It seemed heavy and did not alter it's course. It seemed to have a definite-planned course.

It was not pointed as one would draw a star-- but a solid mass.

Springfield, 4505, Ohio
September 9, 1966

Dear Sir,

A friend of mine told me to write to this address in order to report to the night persons what my son and I saw one evening. I could have written sooner but I did not know who to report to, and therefore did nothing other than call the News-Sun to see if anyone else saw something like we saw. They put a brief report in the column for Springfield Review, but I cannot find a similar report because they did not include any information in the paragraph concerning other reports.

On Thursday evening, August 11, 1965, my 12 year old son, Warren and I were leaving home to go to Riverdale Dairy about 8:50 pm. The sky was somewhat overcast and only a few stars high in the sky were visible to us. We thought it might rain later in the evening, however we were wrong and within about an hour the sky was very clear. Anyway I drove up to a stop street at Rutland and Nagley Avenues, and as we glanced down the street to look for any oncoming cars a bright object took both of our attention immediately and simultaneously. We watched out over the Southern Village Shopping Center a few blocks to the Southwest of our position and as we watched, a glowing ball, appearing about the same size as the Village dampbulbs from our viewpoint, rose up from behind the Village lights at probably a 60 degree angle after turning sharply into a straight course across the horizon, which to our view looked low, maybe about 15 degrees up. At this point, the glowing ball seemed to get a long narrow look, still glowing brightly. As the glowing object got to the point where it was almost opposite from where we were, it appeared to be two lights combined, with the end pointing North glowing steadily, and the South end, on back side pulsating from a fairly bright light to a very bright lights. We have a CB set and I tried to call my husband so he could look out at the object, but he did not have the base radio on the air, so we decided to go back around the block to tell him. At the point that we decided to leave, the object made a sharp 90 degree turn, straight up into the sky disappearing in the overcast. We could not see or find anything like it after that. We heard a faint whirring sound as if it came from the object and sounding similar to the sound of your snow tires. There was only an amber cast to the lights, no colors, other than that.

I suppose I am reporting something you already are aware of, and possibly it was an experimental craft night from the base itself. This was an amazing experience for us and it was definitely something we have never observed before.

Within a matter of minutes we saw another plane going North over our house, which would have been far to the East of the objects, when we were around the block to tell my husband.

We hope this report will be of some small value to you.

Sincerely,
Mrs. [Redacted]

It appeared initially as a satellite floating across the heavens, and we were watching it casually. Suddenly, after about ten minutes, it stopped. Self of us can acclaim that. Then it suddenly zigged to its left (our left, if we faced it). Then, of moments, hesitation, and a zig to the rights, then another hesitation, and to the left. The pattern continued, then the object left our sight.

It was its motions, back & forth that attracted our attention.

Inquiries--Objects in the Sky at Night
Federal Aviation Agency
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

Although this inquiry may be misaddressed, please assist me in directing it to the proper department.

I would like some information that might explain the following occurrence: On Friday night, August 12, 1966, from 9:45 until 10:03 EST, a group of us were star-gazing and constellation-identifying near a moving highway, or star, a peared directly above us, in the vicinity of Vega. It was traveling at an incredible rate of speed. That is, it moved very quickly. There was no way to could say that it was slower or faster than anything, except to say that it moved at the same rate an airplane might move, were an airplane flying. This object, however, was, or appeared, to be a moving star, and was silent.

It it had kept on its course, none of us would have thought it curious. We have all seen such things before, and this appeared to be simply another "satellite". However, soon this star did a curious thing: it stopped for a brief second or two, then veered (from its easterly course to a north-by-north-easterly direction) it traveled then for only a few seconds, then stopped again for a second, and veered dramatically. Its course, size, pattern continued for at least fifteen minutes, and, unable to verify any longer, my companions and I went inside.

I include with this letter a rough map, or chart, that may further elucidate.

Could your agency explain what happened? Could you tell us what it was? Of must we assume that perhaps this was an unidentified satellite (UOS)? If this satellite, or star, has a name, we are certainly curious. The newspapers have made no mention (to our knowledge) of such a happening. Certainly it is an on the national interest for the Government to know what goes on in our skies at night. I am awkwardly trying to say that this letter is sincere, and that we feel (our group) that we deserve an answer.

We anxiously await your reply.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

24 August 66

Conversation with 160th ARG Clinton County AFB, Ohio concerning use of Prop Wash refueling track over central Kentucky on 17 August 66 at approximately 2100-2200.

Conversation revealed the 160th ARG was scheduled to use the track; however, they had received a TWIX stating that the 97th BW at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas would be using the track on the night of 17 August 1966.

Contact was made with the 97th BW. They had 14 135s and 52s using refueling track Prop Wash during the time of the sightings. 52s took off at 18/0145 from Blytheville AFB and proceeded to the central Kentucky area. These aircraft would have definitely over the area at approximately 0200 refueling. These aircraft flying Prop Wash would be on a flight path that would take them from London, Ky. to New Hope, Ky. New hope is approximately 15 miles SSE from Bardstown. These aircraft would have several runs on their particular mission, passing east to west south of Bardstown, then traveling north of Bardstown before making a turn that would take them around to the London area.

KC-135 aircraft are equipped with a fuselage mounted wing illumination light which is turned on at various times to facilitate observation of the wings at night.

Dear Sir,

I have just received a newspaper article which appeared in your paper on 13 August 1966. The newclippings provided various descriptions of unusual lights observed by persons attending the Stephen Foster play at Bardstown.

As Assistant Chief of Project Blue Book, the Air Force office for investigating reported UFO sightings, I feel I can offer a valid conclusion as to the culprit in the majority of the observations on 17 August 1966.

After having spent a full day in investigating, I offer the following comments:

There were a total of 14 B-52 and KC-135 bombers and tankers flying approximately 15 miles south of Bardstown on the night of 17 August 1966. These aircraft were participating in a night refueling mission and would have been refueling over central Kentucky on an east-west flight path. Several different passes were made in this east-west direction south of Bardstown.

A night refueling mission such as this would provide a most unusual display of lights which would have accounted for the "follow-the-leader" pattern. The white boom light and the red rotating beacon on these aircraft would account for those colors being observed.

I am sure that the numerous persons at the play observed this refueling mission; they definitely should have, since these aircraft flew to within 15 miles of Bardstown. The distance would account for the lack of noticeable sound.

Sincerely,

Dear 

Reference your letter of 30 August. The small bits of metal, which you submitted to the project office, are common "Chaff". Chaff is frequently used in radar jamming exercises "Chaff". Chaff is cut to try to confuse the radar operators. Chaff are specific wave lengths and is dropped from aircraft in bunches.

2 Hocking Countians Among Hundreds
Sighting Big Fireball In Sky Over Ohio

A big fireball or meteorite was seen last night in many parts of Ohio, and at least two Hocking County residents were among the observers.

Most of the sightings were in northern Ohio, where Akron police, several county sheriffs and area newspapers received hundreds of telephone calls.

Harold Alter of near Gioisonville, pm, sitting outdoors at 11:50 p.m. when he heard a "swoosh" and saw a strange object in the sky which appeared to be about 20 or 30 feet long. He said it was orange and red at one rounded end but tapered down to a point with a white light at the narrow end.

After said he watched the object as it traveled from the east until treetops hid it from view.

Donald Schultz, city fireman, was returning from Columbus on U.S. Rt. 33 when he saw a strange light in the sky at the same time. He described it as a "brilliant bluish - green light" which lit up the entire "northern part of the sky near Enterprise."

Reports from northern Ohio were similar, and came at the same time. Radio station WAKR at Akron said it was swamped with calls from people, some of whom were convinced if had landed in their yards. It flashed for about five seconds at 11:50 p.m. EST, appearing about 40 degrees above the horizon before burning out at 20 degrees' sighting and all in Summit and all adjoining counties, as well as in Southeast Ohio.

Mark Candusse of Akron, in charge of United Flying Object Investigations here, was quoted in Alliance at the time, where he declared it without question was a large fireball or meteorite.

Similar sightings were made in the Youngstown-Warren area and across the state line at Sharon, Pa.

There is a handwritten note at the bottom of the document, but the text is not clearly legible.
