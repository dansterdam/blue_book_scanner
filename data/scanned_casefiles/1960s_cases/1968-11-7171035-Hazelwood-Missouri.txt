SIR:

WISH TO STATE THAT I SAW A UFO WHICH WAS HOVERING AND WHO STATED: SHE SAW THE SAME THING. IT WAS A WHITE LIGHT, WITH IT CHANGING TO A REDDISH AND THEN A GREEN AND BACK TO WHITE.

THE UFO WAS FIRST SEEN AT APPROXIMATELY 5:16 IN THE SOUTH EASTERN SKY AND THEN MOVED IN A NORTHLY DIRECTION AT A VERY SLOW SPEED.

THE LAMBERT AIR PORT WEATHER STATION SAID IF THEY HAD RELEASED A WEATHER BALLOON LIGHTS ON IT. WEATHER BALLOON HAS NOT BEEN AND NEGATIVE RESULTS WITH THE RADAR.

Continued questions 28-3. Since at the beginning

I did not pay much attention
to this, I signify I don't say at
what time it appeared and at
what time it disappeared. Beside it appeared more
than once. What you
say is that during the two
sightings, it lasted, I mean the
time, I was about 7:35 to 8:15 each
night deluding itself some minute.
Sometimes it would feel out. But
come later earlier when it seems
clearer, we would just see it
about to disappear over the
horizon.

Answer to question 18: I would estimate that it hovered at about 2 miles in aspect of 90°. Sang a jet travels on a straight line and then object traveled in a slang shaped line, that is what it seemed.

Answer to question 19: If a plane were traveling at a height of 25,000 ft. from the ground, it then the object was flying at the height of 50,000 or 60,000 ft. of some the 1/2 ground.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FELL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

This object may be known but since officials in the White House in Washington, D.C. couldn't give me an explanation, perhaps you can. I just want to know what it is.

This object was first seen by me in the later part of November. This object looks like a star and shines like a star. During the course it took every night, it would give a slight jerk to the right or left and continue on its journey. It first appeared on the South side but traveling from East to West until the last night, when it would come out in the North, but still traveling from East to West. Every night it would travel about 15 degrees as shown in the drawing on question No. 6 in the questionnaire. It would take about 8 minutes to travel across the sky.

Then when it appeared again in the later part of February, it was traveling from West to East. This time it would come out on the North Side. We only saw it this time for about 4 nights because the rest of the nights were cloudy.

If it does appear again, I would think it will come around the last part of May first. I have estimated this from the first two sightings.

If some of the questions in the questionnaire are wrongly answered, it is because I misunderstood them. I have tried to answer them as best I can. Some I might not have answered because they refer to an object seen only once and I saw this one several nights.

June 11, 1969

Headquarters U.S. Air Force
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Attention: B.M. Ettenson
Colonel, USAF

Dear Colonel Ettenson:

On April 2, 1969 you answered a letter I wrote to the White House on a UFO I had been seeing. You sent me a UFO questionnaire to fill out because you were unable to give me an explanation. I filled out the questionnaire and sent it in the envelope you attached which was addressed to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. I have not received an evaluation as of this date even though I know it takes time.

On May 13, 1969 I wrote to Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla here in Puerto Rico to see if they could give me an explanation because I had not received an answer from Wright-Patterson AFB. Before I received an answer to that letter, I started seeing the object again on May 18. I immediately wrote then a letter to let them know so that they could be on the look-out for it. I didn't telephone, first of all, because we do not have a telephone or one nearby us that we could use. Besides we have a car in case of an emergency. Second, because that object takes ten minutes to travel across the sky and by the time I get a call through and they launch an aircraft to investigate, it will have disappeared.

It seems that the letter I wrote on May 13, 1969 to Ramey Air Force Base was forwarded to New York and I received an answer from there. The return address was as follows: HQ 72d Cmbt Spt Gp (DC) APO New York 09845. The one who answered this letter was James T. Brothers, Colonel, USAF, Base Commander. He stated in the letter that they were unable to give me an explanation of my sightings and that if I should see it again to let a call through to the Puerto Rico Air National Guard in Isla Verde Airport here in Puerto Rico so that they could launch an aircraft to investigate. As I told you before, I am unable to do so. I have not received an answer to the second letter on May 19 in the morning. On May 20 during the night, it was cloudy and I was unable to observe the object but I did see an airplane travel in the exact direction I had indicated to them. I am almost sure it was an Air Force plane because it made a tremendous noise like a super-sonic airplane.

Washington, D.C.                                                   Page 2                                                   June 11, 1969

Believe me, I wouldn't give it a second thought to call if I had a telephone nearby.

The object has since disappeared for this time. I had stated in the questionnaire that it would appear again in May and it did. Now from my other sightings, I expect it back in August.

I also write this letter because since this object has disappeared during this last sighting, we have seen three more going in different directions even though not in the same night. One in particular traveled very fast. We know they are not airplanes because their lights are like stars and airplanes travel at night with a red light. Am I right?

There are people who have told my brother that they had seen the object during this May sighting two hours and forty-five minutes later during the same night. At which time it would appear the following night and came a half hour earlier. Our relatives, neighbors, and friends have commented on these objects with us but they say they have not written to anybody or given it much attention.

Last night I saw one travel from North to South in a dome-shaped direction. I am going to watch for it tonight.

I write to you because in my belief these objects aren't being given the attention they deserve here in Puerto Rico. I am giving the Air Force my fullest cooperation and yet I see no results.

I know you have a lot of work to cope with but this is a concern of the Air Force.

Perhaps you might like to forward this letter to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. It might help them further in the evaluation. I would have written them a letter but when I sent the questionnaire, it skipped my mind to write down the address in case I should have more information for them.

Forgive me for intruding on your time but I feel it is my duty to supply such information.

Thank you for your time and cooperation.

Cordially yours,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Sirs,

About a month ago several residents of Manchester saw a unusual craft. The craft was very silent, had red lights on it turning around the craft, its other colored lights, and a huge spotlight on the bottom of the craft.

There were several cases. One was with some ladies were coming home from bowling. The craft hovered over their car and turned on its light. Another case was when the craft hovered over a house, turned on its spotlight and lit up the house.

I, I. Name, heard that this craft is an experimental aircraft that will be used for jungle night flying. I do not believe this. I want to know the truth about this craft. I read books and then say that yours not very good in giving answers.

I have a map on the other page. I will show you the general direction that the craft went.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES NOV. 4 -10, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map.

An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publi-

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the weather patterns shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES NOV. 18-24, 1968

The charts in this publication are a
continuation of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau publication,
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar
Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temper-
atures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation
Chart. All of the charts for one day are
arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the
National Meteorological Center, Weather
Bureau. The symbols used on the
500-Millibar Chart are the same as those
used previously in Daily Weather Map.
An explanatory sheet is available, and
single copies may be obtained without
charge by writing to: Environmental
Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville,
Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also
be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50
copies. Checks should be made payable

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and analysis for 7:00
a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows, the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding map time are indicated by
small black squares enclosing white
crosses. Areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and on
which the analyses are based. Occasionally apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from those station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the
height-contours and isotherms of the
500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t.
The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are

shown as dashed lines, and are labeled
in degrees Celsius. The arrows show
the wind direction and speed at the
500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum
and minimum values for the 24 hour
period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The
names of the reporting points can be
obtained from the Surface Weather
Map. The maximum temperature is
plotted above the station location, and
the minimum temperature is plotted
below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation during
the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m.
Amounts in inches to the nearest
hundredth of an inch are for the same
period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth
of snow on the ground in inches as of
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from open National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau maps used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map.

An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public, Attn: Meteorological Services, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses may result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amount Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches are to the nearest hundredth of an inch for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

There is no readable text on this page, only meteorological maps and charts with various lines, contours, and grid patterns. The page appears to be a series of weather maps or atmospheric pressure charts with different projections and scales. The maps include curved lines, grid lines, and some labeled points like "HIGH", but the specific text is too small or blurry to be legibly transcribed.
