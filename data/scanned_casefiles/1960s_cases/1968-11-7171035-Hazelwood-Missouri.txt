Text extracted from the image:

THIS INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

This object may be known but since officials in the White House, Defense Building, give no explanation, perhaps the Air Force does not know what it is.

This object was first seen in the latter part of November. This object looks like a star and shines like a star. During this sighting of the object, it would sometimes give a slight flash. It was first observed the last of the day and continue on its journey. It first appeared to the northwest and would travel across the sky but still traveling from East to West. Every night when it would travel about 15 degrees as shown in the questionnaire. It would take about 3 minutes to travel across the sky.

Then when it appeared again in the later part of February, it was traveling from West to East. This time it would come out on the North side. We only saw it this time for about 4 nights because the nights were getting warmer.

If it does appear again, I would think it will come around the last part of May from what I have estimated. I estimated this from the first two sightings.

If some of the questions in the questionnaire are wrongly answered, it is because in this business you sometimes are unable to answer because they refer to an object seen only once and I saw this one several nights.

June 11, 1969

Headquarters U.S. Air Force
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Attention: D.R. Ettenson
Colonel, USAF

Dear Colonel Ettenson:

On April 2, 1969 I wrote to the White House on a UFO I had seen and was unable to give an explanation. I filled out the questionnaire and sent it in the envelope you instructed which was addressed to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. I have not received an evaluation as of this date though I know it takes some time.

On May 13, 1969, I wrote to Ramey Air Force Base in Arundel, Puerto Rico to see if they could give me an explanation because I had not received an answer from Wright-Patterson. I started seeing the object again on May 15, so I immediately wrote another letter to the Commandant asking them to please hurry the evaluation. I didn't receive anything back from them, so I told them that we could not have a telephone or one nearby us that we could use. Besides we have a car in service of an emergency. So could, because this object takes ten minutes to travel across the sky and by the time I get a telephone and they launch an aircraft to investigate, it will have disappeared.

It seems that the letter I wrote on May 13, 1969 to Ramey Air Force Base was forwarded to New York and I received an answer from Lt Col Retund: the one who answered this letter was Capt Sgt GC (RC) AFO New York 09845. The ones who answered this letter was the one that commanded in Puerto Rico that I had written to first, and indicated in my sightings and that if I should see it again to get a call through to the Puerto Rico Air Force here in Puerto Rico so that they could launch an aircraft to investigate. As I told them in my first letter, I have no way of contacting them quickly. Now I wrote them this second letter on May 19 the morning. It was cloudy and I was unable to observe the object but I did see an airplane travel in the exact direction I had indicated to them. I am almost sure it was an Air Force plane because it made a tremendous noise like a super-sonic airplane.

Transcribed text:

USAF
Washington, D.C.

June 11, 1969

Believe me, I wouldn't give it a second thought to call if I had a telephone nearby.

The object has since disappeared for this time. I had stated in the questions that it would appear again and it did. Now from further sightings, I expect it back in August.

I also write this letter because since this object has disappeared during this last sighting, we have seen three more going in different directions even though not in the same night.

One night another neighbor watched very fast. We know they are not stars and airplanes travel at night with a red light. Am I right?

There are people who have told my brother that they had seen the object during this sighting who heard and forty-five minutes later during the same night. They did some arithmetic to see it would not appear as they followed the following night and suddenly disappeared and reappeared. And they have commented on these objects with us but they say they have not written to anybody or given it much attention.

Last night I saw one travel from North to South in a dome-shaped fashion. I am going to write to you because in my belief these objects aren't being given the attention they deserve here in Puerto Rico. I am giving the Air Force my fullest cooperation and yet I see no results.

I know you have a lot of work to cope with but this is a concern of the Air Force.

Perhaps you might like to forward this letter to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. It might help further in the evaluation of questionnaires I should have more information for them.

Forgive me for intruding on your time but I feel it is my duty to supply such information.

Thank you for your time and cooperation.
Cordially yours,

Dear ,,

About a month ago a qoneral disturbance attractod very unusual craft 1 his craft Irna seen at least 5 different plocos in and around Dono/sue, Ohio. There were several calls to the craft and a phone report to the F.A.A. control tower at I-St. I,ouis municipal airport. 

Those iristances caused quite a stir and, in my opinion, warrant further investigotion. There wore several reliable witnesses who said that this craft hovored at timos and then took off at trrntendous speed disappearing from sight. Some said there was a red rlot-like glow around the top of the craft and that it semod to be controlled by some sort of remote device. 

One man said that he approached to within 300 to LOO yards of the craft and could see very definitely that it was circular or disc shaped. e
said it was very mach larger than a normal aircraft and made no sound at all.

About this craft, a friend works for the F.A.A. control tower and he said there was quite a lot of activity on their scope which couldn't be identified. lie thinks this part of the country is seeing quite an increasing number of these unidentified flying objects.

I hope I may on the other page.

I'll have a full roport written up soon and will send it to you.

Please acknowledge this report. I've tried to give you the highlights as accurately as possible.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an unclassified document from the Department of the Air Force, Staff Message Branch, with details about a UFO reported by witnesses to the Air Defense Direction Center. The text describes the sighting of a radio-controlled balloon ascent and descent, with a transmitter package visible in parachute. The document discusses the movement, appearance, and disappearance of the light, likely due to passage through scattered clouds and changes in wind direction. It also notes that weather observers who launched these balloons made similar inquiries.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. It contains a diagram labeled "WHAT TO DO" and a heading that says "DIDN'T MOVE". However, there does not appear to be any photograph present on this page.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

WHAT TO DO

If a UFO sight is observed, a careful record should be made of the time, duration, direction, size, shape, color, speed, altitude, and direction of movement, as well as any unusual characteristics of the object or phenomena. If possible, the UFO should be sketched or photographed. The observer should avoid making any sudden movements which might cause the object to alter its flight or disappear. If the UFO seems to be approaching the observer, the best action is to remain calm and continue the observation, recording as much detail as possible. Inform the nearest Air Force base immediately if the object is thought to be of a hostile nature.

DIDN'T MOVE

The image contains a form or questionnaire titled "FLYING SAUCERS". The form appears to be part of a document or report related to the Project Blue Book investigation of UFO sightings. There is no photograph present in this particular page.
