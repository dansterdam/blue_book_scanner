Dear Sirs:

I hesitate to write for the second time, but I read in a book about getting when I first heard of this U.F.O. business and I thought it was nonsense, but now others who had read books about them and had experiences seems to think otherwise. A white glow in the sky over the area one night is what they said to look up at and examine, but that only lasted a very short time and seemed to die out and nothing more was reported about it, and a man who spoke of it said that the entire thing was unlike anything he had ever experienced, and that there was something toward a southeasterly direction.
I would say that it picked up about 30 k.p.h. and in 2 seconds it was not to be seen, and it made no sound whatsoever. I am very much interested in any information you can make available for your latest investigation. Thank you for your kind consideration.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Write soon if possible.
