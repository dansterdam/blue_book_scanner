27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY, PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I am positive of what I saw or what I thought I saw. This could be an illusion or any thing else. I am not saying it was a flying saucer but I'm saying it was anything else either.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Sirs:

I hesitate to write for the second time, but I read in a book about getting information on U.F.O.'s at this address and I am very interested in this information.

When a friend of mine was in the U.F.O. business I thought it was nonsense but about two months ago I was in Louisiana with my mother who had recently, me and a couple of other boys were in our backyard playing a game and one of them said to look up at the sky. Glancing light in the sky over the sugarcane field. I looked up and saw it, but about the time I looked up it started moving to my left and as it speeded up it turned to a bright orange. After it left slightly me and a companion was talking about it and he said that about nine months before he and his friend saw an exact sighting of it at one point. It was one and possibly two, approximately 50 to 200 feet off of the ground and moved toward a southeasterly direction.

I would say that it pitched up about 30 M.P.H. a second and in 5 seconds it was going about 200 or more M.P.H.

I am not sure of what I saw or what I think I saw but I am still interested in any information you can send.

Thank you for your time and please send some information.

Yours truly,

MY ADDRESS:

Write soon if possible.

AFR 50-17(C1)

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
