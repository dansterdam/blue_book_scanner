AT 2315 GMT 27TH OCTOBER 1962 EN ROUTE TO NEW YORK FROM PUERTO CORTES, IN SIMILAR OBSERVED POSITION LAT.28.28'N LONG. 79.34'W AT A DISTANCE OF 50 MILES DUE EAST OF CAPE CANAVERAL

WE OBSERVED ELSE OF ROCKET SATELLITE. AT FIRST THERE WAS VERY BRIGHT BALL OF ORANGE LIGHT ON THE RED HORIZON. LOW CLOUD PERMITTED US TO SEE ONLY THE FIRST TWO DEGREES OF FLIGHT

BUT A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE ROCKET WAS OBSERVED AGAIN THROUGH A BREAK IN THE CLOUD AND IT WAS THEN AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 40 DEGREES AND APPARENTLY ON A DUE EAST COURSE. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT WE ALL OBSERVED THAT THE TAIL OF LIGHT COMING FROM THE ROCKET ASSUMED THREE DIFFERENT COLOURS: RED WHITE AND BLUE - RED BEING THE LEADING COLOUR, ANOTHER MOMENT LATER IT WAS OBSCURED AGAIN BUT WAS FINALLY SEEN AS A FAINT WHITE STREAK OR LIGHT IN THE EAST.

OBVIOUSLY A VERY LUCKY CHANCE ENABLED US TO BE IN THE VICINITY TO WITNESS THIS WONDERFUL SIGHT.
