13 Aug 1965

Report received approximately 10:05 p.m. from Mr. Haden, a resident of Beaver, Pennsylvania, reporting a UFO sighting which occurred. The sky was clear and the moon bright. As he stepped outside his home, he noticed a bright light in the sky about 300 feet in diameter at an altitude of about 800 feet. The object was traveling in a northerly direction, silently, and had about 6 to 8 bright lights. Mr. Haden's guess being between 200 and 250 of them.

As this happened, the orange lights around the rim of the object were blinking on and off. The light was a bright blue. The blue light lasted for about 5 to 10 minutes. Then, the blue light went out, and there was only the blinking orange lights. The object then continued on its northerly course and disappeared. The force which almost knocked him down and noticed the intense heat was like a wave passing over him. Some 20 minutes later, he experienced severe burning of his face and hands. He lost sight in both eyes for several hours. He had no vision in his right eye and hazy vision in his left eye. 

The doctor examining him said would indicate the presence of an intense radiant heat. This would indicate the UFO emitted intense radiant heat which affected him in this manner.

Report received from L. Houck, 2 miles north of Baden, Pa. The object conditions were clear, no wind, no haze. Altitude of the UFO from one-half to three-fourths of a mile. The color was a bright amber, first clockwise then counter clockwise. The object seemed to lie stationary for a few seconds, then shoot straight up. Mr. Houck, age 30, is employed as a tool maker for the Tevis Company. He said that he has been seeing some similar objects in the area for several days previous to this. He has photos of these objects which were published in the local newspaper. He plans to go into the house and await developments.
