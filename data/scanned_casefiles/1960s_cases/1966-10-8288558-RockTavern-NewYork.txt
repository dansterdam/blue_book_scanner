1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 20 Oct. 66 21/0002
2. LOCATION: Rock Tavarn, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian
10. CONCLUSION: Other (Locomotive brakeling)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer watched a round, bright white light that appeared to project a spot of some hills. The light disappeared instantaneously behind the mountains. The observer compared the unknown light phenomenon to a locomotive headlight. The light never appeared to be overhead.
Investigating officers' conclusions are that the observer saw a light that, based on terrain features, and pinpoints the spot where the observer was, was probably a locomotive headlight. All traffic in the vicinity at midnight. The NY State police indicated that there were none located on the trestle near where the observer claims the light turned out to be a rail traffic on the trestle.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
(1) Captain Stephen Levine, USAF, Rated Pilot/Navigator
(a) Preliminary analysis of facts obtained from my investigation has led me to deduce that Mrs. observed the light on a railroad locomotive. A train whistle, terrain features, and pin-pointing the spot of her observation support this conclusion. The following are statements and evidence in support of my analysis:
(a) When interviewed, Mrs. stated that she saw me on telephone poles 100 yards south east of her trailer between which she observed this light. She also estimated that the light was four or five miles away on the north east end of Schnecmunk Mt.
Based on this information, I have drawn a plot on the attached map accompanying this report.
(b) Mrs. stated that the light never appeared to become completely airborne; the only time she feels it may have left the ground was when she saw it flickering through the tops of trees. She also thought that there were possibly two beams of light emitting from the same source, one straight beam resembling a headlight, the other a bobbing beam of light. Her description matches perfectly with the headlamp of a locomotive.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: None

(c) One mile east of Salisbury Mills (a) visible on the plot and trails from the observatory, is a very high railroad trestle almost one mile long. This is part of the Erie Railroad tracks. Rail traffic usually passes on the trestle in the vicinity of midnight. The NYState Police at Monroe stated that they have had numerous reports at different times of the same phenomena observed by Mrs. in all cases, this has turned out to be rail traffic on the Salisbury Mills trestle.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
17 October 1966
ROCK TAVERN, NEW YORK
Investigator: Mr. James McLeod
Date of Incident: 17 September 1966
Time of Incident: Approximately 0200 hours
Location of Incident: Rock Tavern, New York
On 17 September 1966, at approximately 0200 hours, Mr. Jacob Freeborn, a resident of Rock Tavern, New York, reported observing a strange object in the sky over his home. Mr. Freeborn stated that he was awakened by a bright light outside his bedroom window. Upon looking outside, he observed a large, disc-shaped object hovering approximately 100-150 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be approximately 30-35 feet in diameter and was emitting a bright, pulsating light. 
Mr. Freeborn stated that the object hovered silently for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view at a high rate of speed. He immediately called the local police department to report the incident.
An investigation was conducted by local law enforcement officials, who were unable to determine the nature or origin of the object. No other witnesses were identified in the immediate area.
This report has been forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation and analysis.
