Office of the Secretary

Washington 25, D. C.

Dear [redacted]

Things were so rushed last Tuesday in Washington that I simply didn't get a chance to call you. My editor and I worked the whole day in trying to rush the manuscript of the book through. We still hope that it can be out in the Spring.

I talked some more with the principals in the "Diamond Case" but get little else that was new. From a rough check, it seems that the parallax of the object was quite large and that whatever it was, it was flying quite low. He still said that he felt that a helicopter was ruled out since the object was obviously low and yet showed no signs of vanes or props. Also no navigation lights and no noise. He was of the opinion that it was too low for the radar to get out of the hush of the city and the pilots coming in for a landing are too intent combatir own problems to see anything other than that which is directly in their pattern. He is a flier of some years experience and so perhaps this should be given some weight, although I am in no position to judge this.

I certainly hope that you and [redacted] can come visit us in Evanston sometime. In the meantime, very best Christmas and New Year's wishes.

Cordially,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle One) (Yes)   No

37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? I think that the object was exactly what it appeared to be. A type of aircraft capable of moving thru the air without the use of conventional wings, rotors, jets, propelling devices, or noise. Object moved somewhat erratically and was or any sign of a craft itself. I have not been able to reconcile what I saw with any known object which would give any similar likeness if put in the air.

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One) Yes No No know factors to estimate from...
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One) Yes No

NAME: [redacted]
(Please Print)

SIGNATURE: [redacted]

DATE: January 20, 1962

Time and location as hereinbefore stated. While stopped at stop light I saw an object about 45° above the horizon slightly to my right and moving toward my left. I realized immediately that the object was of no uniform shape so I stepped out of the automobile in order to determine unobstructed view. The object continued on a straight line course toward my position and passed directly overhead.

(In the meantime the traffic light had changed to "GO" and the automobiles behind me were so busy blowing horns and trying to get around me that no one took the time to look up.) As the object approached I could see no wings, protrusions of any type, or exhaust trail. As the object passed directly over my head I saw that it was diamond shaped, dark gray in color with a pulsating brown-orange glow in the center portion - absolutely no noise could be heard above the noise. I estimated the object to be between 1,200 and 1,500 feet above me. As the object passed to watch it - it appeared to have thickness in proportion to its size which I judged would be approx. the size of a Piper Cub aircraft if it were "spread out". I watched the object until it disappeared behind the easterly building horizon, approx. 30°. The object was very clear against the sky at all times - darker than the sky which was cloudless. Edges were sharp.

(OVER)


- page 21 -

At no time while I had the object in view did it change course or altitude, or move behind or in front of something and reappear, or change in color. The motion was smooth and speed seemed constant. I saw no port holes or other openings. The orange-brown glow in the center portion seemed to puke at rather a rapid rate. I have stopped at the same place several times since the sighting and moved my head across the same flight path of what I estimated the speed to be, and I end up with just about 1 min. for time in sight.

I am convinced that the object I saw was as I have described it and could not have been any conventional heavier, or lighter than air craft, any phenomenous caused by temperature inversion mirage, or sun reflection.

NOTE: Enclosed is a sketch of an idea of what the object might possibly look like in section if the lines referred to in sketch on page 3. were stepping toward the center.

This image appears to be a black and white map of Washington D.C., showing a detailed street grid layout. Some legible street names include:

- Wisconsin
- Chanel (appears to be near the bottom left)

The map shows a grid of streets, blocks, and what seem to be government or institutional buildings. There are curved roads, intersections, and what looks like a river or waterway on the left side of the map. The map appears to be from an older era, likely from the 1960s based on the filename context, with a slightly faded and grainy appearance typical of documents from that time period.

Sections of the city are designated as N.W., N.E., S.W. and S.E. Numbered streets run north and south, lettered streets east and west, and an imaginary line extending from the Capitol. The Washington Monument is located near the center of the city. Numbered base lines and colored to show the limits of the four sections.

Numbered streets run north and south, lettered streets east and west. House and building numbers are shown. For example: the 700 block on G St., N.W., is between 7th and 8th Streets, N.W. The 700 block on 10th St., N.W. is between G and H Streets, S.W.
