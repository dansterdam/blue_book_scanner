Round white-bluish object came from South hovered over Bellingham and preceded to the NE fading over the horizon.
In sight for 4 minutes.

COMMENTS: Sighting consistent with either a/c or Satellite observation based on description and flight as well as duration. No identification of a/c lights, therefore it is more likely that a Satellite was observed. Not ECHO I or Pegasus I. No schedule for ECHO II. Likely that the object was ECHO II or one of the brighter Satellites such as Centaur 2, Satum 5, or Tyros 9.

Mrs. Hunt/man/SAFOTC/72842/9 Sep 65

Dear Mr.

Our office maintains satellite schedules for the Pegasus and Echo satellites only. Echo II was over Seattle on the night of 30 July 1965 at 11:27 p.m.; however, it was heading northeast and should have been east of the city.

We are attaching a list of satellites and space debris of the third magnitude or brighter which were visible as of 22 May 1965. This list, of course, increased due to more recent launches. The sighting which you reported is indeed similar to many reports of satellite observations.

Should you desire a positive identification, perhaps the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Star Catalog Department, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138, would be of some assistance.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

I will begin by saying that I do NOT believe in "flying saucers" or little green men from other planets spying on us. However, I do have some definite information that our government, as well as Russia, has put numerous satellites up in the sky and that these are visible from time to time. My only question now is confirmation of my sighting and which of these I may have seen.

On Friday evening, July 30, between 11:00 and 11:15 p.m. I was driving home and saw a lighted, moving object moving due south at about 45 degrees up in the sky. I went in the house and called for my wife to come out and see it and we watched it more nearly in a line to the south. It alternately changed from red to yellow-ish orange. It was not a plane as a plane's lights will not flash in the manner that this did. I attribute this changing of lights to the tumbling action of the satellite.

I may be slightly off in my estimation of the time but I am wondering you have any information regarding a flight of a satellite at approximately that hour.

Sincerely,

[Signature is blacked out]
