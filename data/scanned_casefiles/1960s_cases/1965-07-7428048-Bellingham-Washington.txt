The text in the document is as follows:

1. DATE & TIME GROUP: 5 JULY 65 06/06302

2. LOCATION: Bellingham, Washington 

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual  

7. COURSE: NE

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: SATELLITE

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Round white-bluish object came from South hover Bellingham and proceeded to the NE fading over in sight for 4 minutes. COMMENTS: Sighting consistent with either s/c or observation based on description and flight as well as duration. No identification action or s/c lights, the more likely that a Satellite was observed. Not Echo II. Likely that was Echo II or one of the brighter Satellites such as Saturn 5 or Tyros 9.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Our office maintains satellite schedules for the Air Force and would appreciate greatly if we could over Seattle on 30 July 1965 at 11:37 p.m. However, it was decided that the city was not visible at that time.

We are attaching a list of satellites and space objects visible in Seattle or locations which were visible as of 1 July 1965. This list, of course, increased due to more satellites or smaller which you reported is indeed similar to satellite observations.

Sincerely,
JOHN P. SPAULDING

HEADQUARTERS
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 30 Jul 65, Bellingham, Washington

TO: HQ USAF SAPICES (Mrs Hunt)
WASH D C 20330

Reference the attached letter from your request 
for information on the unidentified observation of 30 July 1965. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Our office maintains satellite schedules for the PAGASUS and ECHO satellites only. Echo II was over Seattle on the night of 30 July 1965 and its position at the time of your reported sighting indicates it was behind the horizon and should have been past of the city.

We are discussing a list of satellites and space debris of the third magnitude or brighter which were visible as of 22 May. This list, however, did not contain this sighting which you reported is indeed similar to many reports of satellite observations.

Should you desire a positive identification perhaps the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 would be of some assistance.

Commanding Officer
Blaine Air Force Base
Blaine, Washington

Dear Sir:

On Friday evening, July 30, 1965 between 13.00 and 13.15 pm
I was driving home and saw a lighted, moving object moving very fast across the sky. It went at the house and I saw it and watched it move southerly. It was almost a plate like form. It was extremely high, I may be slightly off in my estimation of the time, but I am wondering you have any information regarding a flight of a satellite or something that may have been visible that evening.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
