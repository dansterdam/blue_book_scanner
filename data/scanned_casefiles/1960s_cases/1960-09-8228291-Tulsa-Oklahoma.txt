10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two witnesses observed object at about 20°
above western horizon, when traveling
parallel with horizon, appeared oblong. However
when it was traveling away from witnesses, it
appeared U-shaped. When first observed, it was
close; made complete turn and headed south
for approx 1 min; then turned against base; in
subsequent journey traversed area generally
14 not wide; appeared soft or glowing. Did

11. COMMENTS
Available information indicates strong
probability any reflection or sunlight or
an a/c. Fact that the witnesses live near
an airport does not necessarily mean
inability to identify. Might be light-flying a/c with sun-

SUMMARY:
On or about 15 September 1960 at 1900 hours, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] East King Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma, were in a back yard at about twenty degrees above western horizon. The object, when traveling parallel with the horizon, had a distinct long appearance. However, when it was traveling at an angle, it appeared to be L-shaped. When the object was first observed, it was traveling in a northerly direction. It traveled for about four minutes, then turned south again and traveled south for about four minutes, then turned north again and disappeared shortly thereafter. The object appeared to be a silver color. It did not resemble any known aircraft. It had no wing and left no contrails. The total time elapsed in which the object was in view is estimated at eight minutes.

Proving Agency: Provost Marshal, Tinker AFB                                    Report No. 1                                    Page 2 of 2 Pages

On 28 September 1960, Special Agent Robert M. Atkinson, Detachment 1105, of the Office of Special Investigations, Tulsa, Oklahoma, was contacted by [redacted] who stated that [redacted] of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma, had sighted a strange object in the sky on approximately 25 September 1960. She would not elaborate on reporting the sighting to the CIA, saying she would up as air foolish.

On 29 September 1960, Atkinson interviewed Mrs. [redacted] at her residence. She stated that about noon two weeks ago, on or about 15 September 1960, she was at her home, 650 East Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her husband were driving west in the block just west of the Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The sun and her husband observed an extremely red object in the sky.

After traveling north for a short time the object made a complete turn and headed south, traveling south over a period of some time, then turning due north again until it disappeared. The object was in view from five to eight minutes. When traveling north and south it had a different color appearance, however, when it went into turns, it appeared to be U-shaped. It had no wings and left no contrails. The object appeared to be silver in color but did not glare nor reflect the sunlight. It appeared to be quite thin and traveling about the same speed as Echo 1. No adverse was in the air during this time the object was in view and the object did not resemble any known satellite.

Mrs. [redacted] attempted to determine the exact date the object was sighted. She stated that it was the same day that a new satellite was launched. She recalled that she was referring to the first major satellite launching following the satellite as called Cocoa. Mrs. [redacted] contacted the local newspaper and verified the satellite was called Cocoa. Mrs. [redacted] stated that she had called a newspaper, weather bureau, and a Government office the day after she sighted but no one appeared to be interested.

Mrs. [redacted] is a heavy set woman about fifty years old. Her husband is a truck driver. Both have and have close work classes and arrived at that both have excellent vision at a distance. She appears to be an open-minded, her conversational approach was rational. However she took offense to questions if she could interest that was doubting her story. Neither the husband nor the wife made any attempt to contact the Tulsa Municipal Airport all of their lives. Her home at present is approximately two miles from the Tulsa Airport.

The foregoing information was received in the Provost Marshal Office on 13 October 1960, contained in a letter from the Commander, 4th District Office Special Investigations.

This report is submitted in accordance with paragraph 4, AFR 200-2, dated 14 September 1959.

Analysis and Conclusions: THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE REPORT IS VERY LIMITED BUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT THE SIGHTINGS POSSIBLY RELATE TO REFLECTION OF SUNLIGHT FROM AIRCRAFT. THE FACT THAT MORE THAN ONE WITNESS COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEIR REPORT IS INCORRECT. THE MOST POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING IS AIRCRAFT.
