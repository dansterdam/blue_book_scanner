UFO Observations, 29 August 1967

American Meteor Society
Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072

Dear

The Aerial Phenomena Branch is investigating two unidentified flying object sightings in the Dayton, Ohio area on 29 August 1967 at approximately 10:00 pm EDT. The observers reported the object as a bright fiery object that exploded into fragments. However, they also estimated the time duration as thirty to sixty seconds.

Any information that you can provide regarding this sighting would be appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Attention: TDET/UFO
Dear Major Quintanilla:                                                1967-10-10

In reply to your letter of Oct. 5, an examination of the fireball file shows nothing whatever for August 29 at any hour. However, reports often reach me very late and something may yet come. Incidentally I regret that my Ohio observers were less active than usual in 1966 and 1967, so less reports have come in generally. If any do turn up for about 10:00EDT Aug. 29, I will be glad to let you have copies.

Most sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:                                        1 September 1967

Subject: UFO Sighting, 29 Aug 67
Mr. [redacted], Kettering, Ohio 45420 (base extensions)
[redacted] observed what he thought was a satellite breaking up.

Satellite looked like it came from west and then it looked like a fireball with a portion flying north and part going east, saw it for approximately ten seconds. Not too certain of the time element, saw it approximately 0950 pm. The satellite was firey and falling apart saw it for about ten seconds then it faded out. [redacted] requested he be sent a form 164 to help us in evaluating this sighting and others for the same night. [redacted] also requested that he be notified of our findings.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
