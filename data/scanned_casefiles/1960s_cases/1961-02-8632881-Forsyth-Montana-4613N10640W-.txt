1. DATE
6 Feb 61

2. LOCATION
Forsyth, Montana (4613N 10640W)

3. DATE-TIME GROUP
Local 2105
GMT 0704052

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE
Military CIVILIAN

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
30 Min.

7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
1

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Farther away it got, it turned red.) 2 times bigger than star. First observed 80° elevation 20° azimuth. Disappeared down to horizon 40°

11. COMMENTS/POSITION OF OBJECT
by witness coincides w/Venus to time and date. Info for position of Venus is taken from 1961 Almanac. FM witnesses position planet would have set at 0435z.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
Was Astronomical
Probably Astronomical Venus
Other
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

It is FTD conclusion that witnesses was viewing Venus and that atmospheric refraction and extreme brightness of planet (magnitude -4.2) were contributing factors to misidentification. A/c reported to be in general area at time were probably contributing factors also.
