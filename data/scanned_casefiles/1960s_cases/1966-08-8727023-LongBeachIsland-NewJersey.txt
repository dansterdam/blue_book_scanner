Oct. 16, 1966

Dear Sir:

On August 7, 1966 at about 3 or 4 A.M. my husband, my son and I, saw two bright lights in the sky over the ocean, at Beach Haven, Long Beach Island, N.J.

They were lower than the poles yet too high for lights from boats, and looked like two naked lights with a twinkle. We saw it with the naked eye and with binoculars. They did not send 164

The only text visible in this image is the letter "H" located in the center of the topmost circular shape in the hand-drawn sketch. The image appears to be a simple black and white line drawing with curved lines and arrows, but no other legible text is present.

Here is the text from the document:

Drive that faded away with the coming of dawn.

We also heard a whistling sound as of many airplanes. It was not the sounds of the ocean.

Pictures that we took with our first camera did not clearly show.

Have you had any other reports of such a sight at that time?

Yours truly,

P.S. My husband is Director of Police at Elizabeth, N.J. and my son is 16 years old.
