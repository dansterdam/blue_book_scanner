2. LOCATION: Fairborn & Dayton, Ohio

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 0200

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS: No

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 8-15 min

7. SOURCE: Civilian

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 3

9. COURSE: N-S

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: 3 lights, not particularly bright, moving slowly, appearing to be moving counterclockwise.

11. COMMENTS: Subsequent to these reports, it was discovered that a gasoline station just opening up in a parking lot had men in search light for advertisement at 1 or 2 nights. 3 people in the area said they had witnessed this phenomenon. 1 of 3 persons saying that a searchlight was only a gasoline station. Data could not be verified. This witness may or will not be seen, only reflection on clouds. The witness in both cases said the lights were due to clouds being broken, therefore appearing as more than 1 object.

Extract from Duty Officer's Report                                     3 July 1961

ATIC-4X2, Maj Priand

The following, extracted from 1/Lt Kimball's Report dated 1 July 1961, is quoted for your information:

0930 hours, The 376th Command Post, Lockbourne AFB called to report UFO sighting by local resident, Mrs. [redacted] of 1890 Fairwood Ave., Columbus, OH 69733. The [redacted] reported, according to the 376th OL, a strange light in the sky at elevation approximately 45 degrees. Time of sighting unknown but presumably about 2230 to 2330. Lockbourne tower personnel indicated possibility of Venus as the position in the sky. 376th recorded incident to 1st Lt Ash AT 1253, WGAD. Later called 376th and asked them to call ATIC. Did not think it necessary to alert Aerial Phenomena Group at this time.

0315 hours, Received call from local resident concerning UFO. Details contained on attached Form 164. Since caller indicated that UFO was still in sight, he was asked to check it out. Look at it. He stated that he thought no further action was necessary.

0415 hours, Received call from USAF Command Post, Major Hall, who stated that they had received a wire from Florida stating that a Florida resident had seen a UFO at about 0342, 2 July 61. Details given were similar to those reported by Dayton resident. I requested that a copy of the message be sent to ATIC and Major Hall stated that he would do so.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line so show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
