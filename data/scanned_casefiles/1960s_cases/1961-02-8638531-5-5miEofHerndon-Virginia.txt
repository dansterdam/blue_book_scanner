Oval-shaped, dull yellow light, size of pen. Obj first sighted above horizon as a red glow, which changed to yellow, orange, and white. Sighted about 10° above horizon, azimuth 4900 mils. Disappeared at 3° azimuth 4900 mils. No maneuvers noted except obj appeared to rise rapidly in 10° to approx 14°, then moved directly W to 3° and disappeared.

11. COMMENTS
Apparent slow movement tends to indicate that obj was an astronomical light. Sighted obj possibly a planet. Venus was in astronomical position for obj, and planet was at its brightest. Color change and apparent rise was probably due to it being near horizon.
