Dear Mr. [redacted]:

We thank you once again for another fine observation report.

It is, of course, virtually impossible to determine the nature of the object you saw with only one report to evaluate. We are therefore forwarding your letter to:

Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center
United States Air Force
(AFCIN-4E2x)
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

so that your report may be compared with any others which may have been received there.

If you should experience further sightings of the object, please report directly to the above address.

Thank you for your time and interest.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Thank you for your reply of September 23, regarding my letter of 21 August also info on the Star Charts.

This may be of interest to you. Last night September 26 at between 7:55 and 8:40 PM while observing the South pole of the Moon a peculiar image of a dark shadowy elongated mass was seen. I am not sure whether it was a shadow on the moon or the actual rocket orbiting the moon. I will attach the same. It was near to the earth's rotation. It could be a rocket on the way to the light. This was observed at 250 power. The place of observation was near San Antonio. This is all the info I have.

Cloud cover prevented observation for three hours. I watched after that for an hour but not able to see it again.

Thank you I am deeply interested in the hobby and the welfare of this Nation.

Sincerely,
[redacted]

Cambridge 38, Mass.

Dear Sirs:

I am rather interested in reporting what I observed, on to be verified.

Since I started amateur observer here many things I do not know, I do scan the skies with my 3 inch Refractor, used as a PTT 200.

On the morning of August 22, 1960 - 1:45 AM CST - Lat. 32 Degrees -

(while waiting for Sun) A light appeared in the area of Declination 43 degrees, RA 270, rising at a fast rate when it reached the position:

Approx. Declination 29 degrees, RA 270, it slowed down, during its slowing down it seemed to have a slight lateral motion, after that it moved very clearly and almost motionless.

Although and took a position in the KAPPA, ALOES and ALMACH group. The magnitude at the beginning was 2-3 long, after its lateral motion its magnitude became 0 step 1.

I was unable to observe on August 23 because of cloud cover. I have not been able to find it again.

There are four possible (1) U.S.A. Satellite (2) U.S.A. Nose RE Fixed (3) Orbit Satellite above earth (4) USAF Space Cabin which carried the cargo returning to earth.
