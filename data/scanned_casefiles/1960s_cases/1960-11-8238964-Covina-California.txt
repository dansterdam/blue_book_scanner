The text on this page is very faint and partially obscured by black redaction marks. I can partially make out some text, but much of it is illegible. The visible text appears to be a handwritten document with some words discernible, but not enough to confidently transcribe a complete sentence. There are three horizontal black redaction bars covering portions of the document.
