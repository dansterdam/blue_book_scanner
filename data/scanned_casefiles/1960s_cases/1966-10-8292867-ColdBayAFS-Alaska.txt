11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
[partially obscured text] reported observing a white colored object approach the runway at approximately 50-75 feet above the ground. As runway lights were turned up to better determine the object, the object then accelerated so fast down the runway, that the observer was unable to use his field glasses. The object then veered southwest and climbed. It was not sustained not blinking although it appeared to move up and down slightly as if affected by air. The light was observed for about three seconds to turn and climb during the last second. There were no reported aircraft in the area; however, it is possible that an aircraft on a special mission is responsible for this sighting.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   20   DEC   1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

NOTE: 1. Date and time are on file at Cold Bay, Alaska Flight Service Station in the daily log. I do not recall the exact time. If you feel it's important, I feel sure you can obtain a copy of the log by writing the chief of the station and requesting a copy.

At the time of the sighting I was at work and I had an air carrier estimating Cold Bay shortly beginning an approach. As was my custom I had the lights in the cab turned down low. I got up from the console and looked out the window to make a visual check of the runway. As I looked to the north end of the runway I saw a light coming down the center of the runway. My first thought was, I had an aircraft on approach that I didn't know anything about. The light was moving at about the speed of a large aircraft landing. It was 700 ft. high. The light continued down the center line of the runway at about a height of 50 feet. The Cold Bay Airport is equipped with high intensity runway lighting. The lights were on step area (3), the lighting control panel was located to the right and behind me. As the light reached a spot just a little north of my position I reached around and flicked the lights to see for (1) hoping to cause a reflection off the body or to check as I was still some 10 sec a while. Then a light even brighter made a right turn and started to climb increasing speed extremely fast, clearing Frosty Mountain in a second or two, (elevation over 5,000'). At this time I lost sight of the object in a second or two level off and start rising behind the mountain. At this time I called Cold Bay "radar" site (Decline) and asked them to take a sighting. They advised nothing sighted.

The weather station at Cold Bay released a balloon at about the same time as the sighting. I checked with the weather station and they advised they released their balloon in about the same time I saw the light. In looking to the approximate path I have indicated, at least in portion coming down the runway). I point this fact out to advise you I know of the balloon release before you may ask me about it. I am familiar with balloons, release procedures, etc. The light was not a balloon light, nor was it any aircraft that I know about.

(no other thing which I for to point out above). When the light turned and started to climb it did so sharply, ex. when and airplane turns or climbs it makes an arc when this light turned and started climbing it made an angle as I have indicated in the drawing.
