J. THERE WERE WEATHER BALLONS LAUNCHED FROM JACKSON, MISS.,
MOBILE, ALA. AND NEW ORLEANS, LA. THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE WIND
WAS BLOWING MAY HAVE CARRIED THE BALLONS FROM JACKSON, MISS. OR
MOBILE, ALA. INTO THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. THESE BALLONS WERE
LAUNCHED AT 102 7 SEP 65.

K. RUSSELL J MAERING JR, 1ST LT, USAF, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER,
3RD TACTICAL FIGHTER WING. BOTH REPORTING INDIVIDUALS SEEMED
COMPETENT AND SINCERE ABOUT WHAT THEY SIGHTED. THE WEATHER WAS
CLEAR WHICH HELPED TO MAKE GOOD IDENTIFICATION. BOTH OBSERVERS
STATED THAT SEVERAL AIRCRAFT WERE SPOTTED ON THE SAME EVENING AT
LOWER ALTITUDES. THE OBJECTS MAY HAVE BEEN AIRCRAFT OR A HIGHLY
REFLECTIVE SATELLITE.
