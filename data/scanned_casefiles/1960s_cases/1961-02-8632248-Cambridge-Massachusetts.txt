10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright silver-colored object, between size of pea and head of pin. Sat looked almost like a star. 80° elevation when first observed. Disappeared toward horizon.

11. COMMENTS
Object improbably for planet Venus. It is not unusual for the planet to be seen in the daytime and it was very bright during this period having a magnitude of +1.1. It is surprising however that the witnesses did not report the shape as a small moon since the planet was in a position which resulted in this appearance. Setting time of planet coincides with disappearance of object. This object was probably planet Venus.

☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☒ Was Astronomical VENUS
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
