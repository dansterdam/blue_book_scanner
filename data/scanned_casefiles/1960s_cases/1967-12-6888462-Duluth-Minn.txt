INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

(2) CAUSE AND SIGHTING: On 4 December 1967 at approximately 8:30 p.m., my wife and I observed a strange light in the sky over Duluth, Minnesota. It appeared to be larger than a normal aircraft light and was moving in a erratic manner, changing directions rapidly. It appeared to remain stationary at times, then move in a straight line, and then suddenly accelerate and change directions. The light was very bright, almost blinding, and seemed to be self-illuminated. We observed it for approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared.

(3) FURTHER DETAILS: I am a former Air Force officer and have considerable experience in observing aircraft. This light behaved in a manner that I have never seen before with any conventional aircraft. It did not resemble any known type of aircraft or other celestial object. The movements were completely unexplainable in terms of known aerodynamics or propulsion systems. I must conclude that what we observed was some type of unidentified flying object. I hope that this report will be of use to your investigation of this incident.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

We were invited to investigate a sighting of a UFO which occurred in Duluth, Minnesota, on the evening of December 6, 1967. The observers were Mr. and Mrs. R--, who reside at 2605 East Second Street, Duluth, Minnesota.

According to their report, at approximately 7:00 PM, CST, they observed a very bright light, estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, hovering over a hill or ridge about a mile distant from their home. The light was described as being bright white in color, and was pulsating or flashing on and off at irregular intervals. At times it appeared to be sending out beams of light in various directions.

The object remained in the same general area for about 20-30 minutes, during which time the observers watched it intently. Occasionally it appeared to move slightly, but always returned to the same position. Finally, the light suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

The observers stated they were quite certain the object they saw was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. They believed it to be some type of unconventional aerial phenomenon. The weather at the time was clear, with only a few high clouds present. There were no other reported sightings of the object from other sources.

We conducted a thorough investigation of this incident, including interviews with the observers and a field investigation of the area. Based on the information gathered, we have concluded that the object observed was most likely an unidentified aerial phenomenon of an unknown nature. We were unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the object, and our investigation has left us with more questions than answers. Further study and analysis would be required to gain a better understanding of this incident.

Many irregularly shaped, bluish-white lights moving slowly, changing course and altitude. At one point a group of 5 or 6 lights were hovering in one spot for several minutes before moving away again. The lights appeared to be larger than stars. They appeared to be about the size of an automobile headlight at a distance, though the actual size and distance could not be determined. The lights were brighter than the surrounding stars and moonlight made it difficult to determine the exact color, though they appeared bluish-white. The lights moved slowly and silently, unlike any airplane or other known aircraft.

House in Duluth, Minnesota, on December 6, 1967 at approximately 10:15 p.m. Clear night with a few scattered clouds. I noticed a bright light in the sky, yellowish-white in color, which seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. The light appeared much larger than an ordinary star or planet. It seemed to fluctuate in intensity, sometimes appearing very bright and then fading. It remained in view for approximately 15 minutes. I called my wife to observe the object, but she was unable to see it from our house. The object then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.
