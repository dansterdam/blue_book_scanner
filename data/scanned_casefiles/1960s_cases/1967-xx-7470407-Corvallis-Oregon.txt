    Observers watched a round ball of fire about the size of a small plane travel across the sky and disappear on the western horizon. The object blinked 4 or 5 times then disappeared from view. The surface winds at the time of the sighting were from 120 degrees at 7 knots.

    The description is consistent with that of a sighting of a hot air balloon.
