PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 12/05002

2. LOCATION: Corpus Christi, Texas (one witness)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 hr-20 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual Tx

7. COURSE: Stationary

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Both Jupiter and Sirius were rising just before the sighting. Sirius on an azimuth of 205 degrees and Jupiter on an azimuth of 70 degrees.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer noted a round shaped object climb slowly in the eastern sky. The object was compared to that of a large star. Various colors were noted during the observation. The object did not disappear but was still there 20 minutes later.

Although both Sirius and Jupiter were rising on the eastern horizon it is difficult to actually say which was responsible as the alleged UFO. It is more probable, though that Sirius was responsible for this particular astronomical event. Sirius is the brightest star in the sky and has often been mistaken for a UFO.
