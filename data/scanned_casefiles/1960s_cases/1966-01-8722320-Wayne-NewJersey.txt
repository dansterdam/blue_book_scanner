MEMO for the record: 24 Jan 67

Contact was made with Major J. J. O'Donnell, McGuire AFB, New Jersey, in response to a request that some UFO Police officer take several policemen into a large auditorium and tell them they were to report on anything out of the ordinary occurring. The only sighting that was investigated by McGuire on 11 Jan 1966 was from a civilian who reported seeing a white light maneuvering in the sky. Major O'Donnell said that he could not confirm that any sighting or report of an individual. All the information was taken over the phone, and Major O'Connell would not consent to having the name and address of the individual who made the report.

Contact was made with Lt. KING (ox-720) at Steward AFS, New York. He said that without a specific date he could not check the sighting. He would try to have a record of any reports he might have received.

Call made back to Lt. King with the correct date of the sighting. He was requested to check on any aircraft out of Steward that could have been in the vicinity. The policeman claim that after the Lt. O'Connell sighting 11 Jan 66, the sighting was lowered in to the area.

Major Harris called from Steward AFS in regards to the initial questions posed to Lt. King. Major Harris said that there were no reports of any aircraft from Steward and that he had checked the records and could find no account of the Jan 66 sighting being reported to the Air Force. He said the Oct 66 case was investigated by Steward.

Contact was made with Air Police at Willow Grove NAS, Pa. in regards to anyone from that base going to investigate in Jan 66. Conversation with Mr. George Albert, Chief Security Police, revealed that no one from Willow Grove was sent to investigate the sighting.

The text on the page discusses the contents of the report and mentions Major Ross, Police Art, Wayne, New Jersey, and that there were no photographs included, but that of course could not account for the sighting.

Below is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

MEMO for Record

At 0315, 12 January 66, the Duty Officer received a call from the City Desk, Area Code 212, COT-1222, who stated that he had received a call from the Mayor and Sheriff.  was concerned about a UFO reported over Waraque, New Jersey. He stated it was observed from 1930 to 2030 on 11 Jan 66 and reappeared at 0220 on 12 Jan 66 and continued for the rest of the night. He said the citizens lodged and begged and stated all they could when they were looking into it. He requested we check it out and call him back. Sighting was not officially reported to the Air Force as a preliminary investigation was made within the office on the information received from the Duty Officer. The following could have been the result at to the sighting.

1st Observation: SATURN on 11 Jan 66, at 1930 EST was on a azimuth 245 degrees, elevation of 15 degrees. At 2030 on a azimuth of 255 deg, elevation of 7 deg.

13 January 1966
Wayne, New Jersey 

From the description and other available information it appears that the witness observed an aircraft. The only description given was that of a bright blue-white light that was traveling toward the northwest with an erratic flight path. The witness himself compared the light to the brightness of an aircraft strobe light and estimated the speed of the unidentified object to be that of a jet aircraft. Considering the high density air-traffic in the New York area it is felt that an aircraft was observed. Without additional information to eliminate a possible aircraft evaluation the case is being carried as such.
