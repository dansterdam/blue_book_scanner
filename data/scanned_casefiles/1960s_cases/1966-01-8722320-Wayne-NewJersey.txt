MEMO for the Record:  24 Jan 69

Contact was made with Major O'Connell, McGuire AFB, New Jersey in regards to accusations that some Air Force officers took several police officers into a large auditorium and told them they were crazy. This supposedly occurred back in Jan 66. The only sighting that was investigated by McGuire on 11 Jan 1966 was from a witness by the name of [illegible]. The information was taken over the phone by the major director and forwarded to Major O'Connell for his study. Major O'Connell said that he nor anyone from McGuire went out to personally interview the individual. All the information was taken over the phone. Major O'Connell wanted to know what auditorium did this happen in and if the policeman did not get the officers name they were rather poor.

Contact was made with Lt. KING (ex-720) at Steward AFB, New York. He said that without a specific date he could not check the air activity records. He would try to help locate The UFO investigator at the Jan 66 sighting.

Call made back to Lt. King with the correct date of the sightings. He was requested to check on any aircraft out of Steward that could have been in the Wanaque, New Jersey on 11 Oct 66. The policeman claim that after their 11 Oct 66 sighting 5 or 7 helicopters and 10 to 12 jet aircraft came into the area.

Major Harris called from Steward AFB in regards to the initial questions posed to Lt. King. Major Harris said that there were no aircraft from Steward AFB in the area of Manaque at 2100 hrs 11 Oct 66. He said he had looked through the past UFO records and could find no account of the Jan 66 sighting being reported to the Air Force. He said that neither the Jan 66 nor the Oct 66 case was investigated by Steward.

Contact was made with Air Police at Willow Grove NAS, Pa., in regards to anyone from that base going to Wanaque in Jan 66. Conversation with Mr. George Albert, Chief Security Police, revealed that no one from Willow Grove goes out to investigate UFO sightings. He knew of no time when anyone from the base went out into the field to investigate a sighting.

Contact: Maj. Ross [ illegible AFB] ex 2717

Memo for the record:

Contact was made with Major Ross, McGuire AFB, New Jersey (ext. 2717). Major Ross said that there were no helicopters stationed at McGuire. There were no aircraft from McGuire that were in the area at the time of the sighting. Major Ross said that a P-106 crashed back in May 66, in that area, but that of course could not account for the sighting.

SECOND HAND REPORT

MEMO for Record

Managua, N. J. (assumed)
11-12 January 1966

At 0515, 12 January 66, the Duty Officer received a call from a [redacted], City
Desk, Area Code 212, CG7-1212, who stated that he had received a call from the
Mayor and Sheriff. [Redacted] was concerned about a UFO reported over Managua,
New Jersey. He stated it was observed from 1930 to 2030 on 11 Jan 66 and
reappeared at 0220 on 12 Jan 66 and continued for the rest of the night. Mr
[Redacted] said he called McGuire and Stewart AFB's and stated all they told him they were
looking into it. He requested we check it out and call him back. Sighting
was not officially reported to the Air Force so a preliminary investigation was
made within the office on the information received from the Duty Officer. The
following could have been the result to the sighting. [Partially illegible]

1st Observation: SATURN on 11 Jan 66, at 1930 EST was on a azimuth 245 degrees,
elevation of 15 degrees. At 2030 on a azimuth of 255 deg, elevation of 7 deg.

2nd Observation: JUPITER on 12 Jan 66, at 0220 EST was on a azimuth of 265 deg,
elevation of 38 deg.

11 January 1966                                                Wayne, New Jersey

From the description and other available information it appears that the witness observed an aircraft. The only description given was that of a bright blue-white light that was traveling toward the northwest with an erratic flight path. The witness himself compared the light to the brightness of an aircraft strobe light and estimated the speed of the unidentified object to be that of a jet aircraft. Considering the high density air-traffic in the New York area it is felt that an aircraft was observed. Without additional information to eliminate a possible aircraft evaluation the case is being carried as such.
