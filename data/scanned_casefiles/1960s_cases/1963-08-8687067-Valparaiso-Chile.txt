SUMMARY:
This report forwards translation of a sighting of unidentified flying object which was seen near the City of Valparaiso on 28 August 1963.

1. The following is a translation of a report made by the Astronomical Society of Valparaiso on 28 August 1963.

"On Sunday, 11 August around 22.00 hours local time, on the Eastern side of Observatory of Paso Hondo (latitude 33° 02'4 longitude 71° 29'3) W of Greenwich - 14 hours) there was observed in the sky an incandescent body which was not given any importance believing that it was an aircraft from the "El Bolson" Air Base which is close by.

23.16. The best observations of this body were made between 23.00 hours and 23.16.

This unidentified body was making circles between the headings of 0700 and 0800 and the altitude varied between 130 and 210.

The circles which this object was making represented a slight inclination over our horizon in such a manner that they appeared ovals of 90 in amplitude.

If these ovals were partitioned in its two diameters with the times running N-S, E-W, the subject body appeared in the N increase in magnitude towards the Western point, diminishing towards the South until it disappeared completely and again reappearing in the N.

It was obvious the Western point was the nearest to the observer and the factor of -4, reaching a factor of -7 to reappear with an increased brilliance of a maximum factor of 1 to 7.

In one of its first observed rounds between the hours of 23.10 and 23.16 it appeared between West and South and its trajectory was accompanied by a microscopic luminous points in its proximity. This was seen from a portable telescope by our director, Mr. Juan Frutos and his wife, both of which are recognized to observe our skies.

The colors were from yellowish red at its greatest magnitude, and while it was losing its brilliance it reached a color of pale yellow, in its greatest intensity the colors observed were shades of golden reaching to bright red.

Considering:
That our director, Mr. [redacted] of Valparaiso) is experienced and zealous, that immediately upon noticing that this body was not an aircraft he telephoned El Belloto and gave his observations to the Officer of the Day, Lt Cabezas, asking him if it would be possible to obtain information regarding Antofagasta and altitude, etc., since Lt Cabezas was at that moment observing the unidentified objects with the knowledge that there were no aircraft at that time.

The observations of Lt Cabezas supported the visual sightings of Mr. [redacted]

There were some differences in the altitudes observed by the two individuals, this was due to the geographical span between El Belloto and the Observatory in El Paso Hondo, even though they were very close to each other.

In addition the observations made by [redacted] and those made by Lt Cabezas were made with binoculars.

This information furnished has been the product of a verbal investigation in which all the antecedents will be presented only after writing of this report.

Comments: This unidentified flying object is believed to have been a NASA DC-4 which was flying in Chile at the time of this sighting. This aircraft was flying in this area to calibrate the tracing system of the NASA station located at Peliehue, Chile. The aircraft accompanied this tracking by means of a very brilliant light which is pulsed by radio time signal emitted from the ground station. The radio beacon on the aircraft is similar to the beacon in an artificial satellite. Thus with the radio measurements made by the equipment at the ground station plus a picture of the time-coded flashing light against a dark background, the NASA personnel are able to calibrate the combined tracking system. This beacon light on board the aircraft is of extremely high intensity and it has been agreed by NASA officials in the area that this light was the object sighted by members of the Astronomical Society of Valparaiso. This report is hereby submitted to preclude the listing of a similar report by another agency.
