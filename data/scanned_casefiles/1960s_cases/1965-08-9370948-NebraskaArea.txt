Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)

Reference: AFR 200-2, as amended. The following described unidentified flying objects are an addition to our report of

2. Description of Objects: The reported objects are plotted on the attached map. The descriptions as gathered in subparagraphs below:

a. The objects were observed by civilian witnesses and reported to the United Army troops who assisted in their investigation. The sighting began at about 1535 CST, and the objects were in view for approximately 15 minutes. The size of the objects was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter, and they were observed at an altitude of about 2,000 feet above the ground.

b. The objects were observed from several vantage points and were seen by nine witnesses. See plot number 3.

c. The objects appeared as rotating, glowing objects, whitish in color. The first object was observed to change shape from a circular to a diamond-shaped configuration, and the last object observed had a tail which appeared to follow it behind.

d. The objects moved in a zig-zag pattern at a rapid rate, about 50 degrees per second, and disappeared from view apparently due to the size of the objects and the distance they traveled.

e. One of the objects, which appeared to be the size of a pinhead, seemed to project a beam of light which illuminated the objects under observation. This occurred when the objects were observed through 7x50 binoculars.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing typed text describing unidentified flying object (UFO) observations.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the following text from the document:

FIVE successive sightings of the object, which came and disappeared to the west of the observer.s location, and was observed by other observers, but as it moved the object changed color from bright red to dark blue, and white lights as a dome on top.

4. A Sergeant and two civilians, the latter two being employees of a local telephone company, observed the object, about 60 to 80 feet in diameter, brilliant blue-green in color and about 500 feet altitude, for ABOUT 10 MINS., as this object is estimated at a weather balloon. Object was also observed by 10 others, as this object is estimated at a weather balloon. Object was also observed by 10 others. See plot number 6.

5. On last was observed by group of eight Young-adults/late teens in area of Cheyenne, WY group also carried a 22/100 telescope. Object moved from west to east, somewhat higher above horizon. Seen for about 10 Mins. During this period, two additional, somewhat higher above horizon objects appeared, making a total of three such objects. See plot number 7.

6. Objects viewed by several persons. at Gulf, who informed two officer launch site. The objects appearing as twin lights, about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, climbing at a high rate, and can present a serious hazard to air traffic.

7. The remains of the UFO were found by air force surveyors. The core sample revealed an extremely dense material and can present a serious hazard if approached.
