THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. YOUR MAIL WILL NOT BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. RETURN TO AIR FORCE (ATIC) (TEIER), WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433, (AS SHOWN IN ITEM 17 ON ADDITIONAL SHEETS ARE NEEDED FOR NARRATIVE OR SKETCHES)

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON?
DAY 11 MONTH Jan YEAR 69

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 2:15 TIME 13 MINUTES □A.M. □P.M.

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 2:45 TIME 25 MINUTES □A.M. □P.M.

4. TIME ZONE:
□EASTERN □CENTRAL □DAYLIGHT SAVINGS □MOUNTAIN □PACIFIC □STANDARD □OTHER

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A MAP. DRAW WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS. IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY, YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

AFR 80-17(C1)

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THIS COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
