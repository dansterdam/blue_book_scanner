1. Interception, attempted after report of 1 December. Call received from Major Sichling, 7277th Air Division, and was in evidence for considerable time, indicating this to be a legitimate incident. F-102 military aircraft, sighted at 17,500 feet, flying in almost precise circle and doing some maneuvering. At 17,500 a civilian AEC aircraft was observed also at 3,000 feet, allegedly about the same time. Evidence that these two objects may have been observing each other.

Low Level (2500 and below) Air Defense Command Intercept area, and appeared to maneuverable operating in the 2500 - 5000 ft Altitude high speed routes, VFR. Visual contact only, and speed indicated as Mach conversely high, speed routes.

2. Comments of present day review with original observer (F-102 pilot). Pilot confirmed sighting, however described the object as changing shape from circular to one that appeared to dwindle into window, the little girl pointed the object out from the horizon - she varying descriptions as to shape. The object did make a climbing maneuver without changing configuration, the said maneuver the pilot felt was sub-standard jet-type performance. Object disregarded as a legitimate sighting, the said maneuver the pilot felt was sub-standard jet-type performance. Object disregarded as a legitimate sighting, the pilot reassessed that report to the state governor as mistaken, and that a personal would feel similarly. This reassessment is concurred on by officials, and only this pilot's original report would stand as a designated military training area. Not only would it represent a considerable risk violation FAA airspace regulations, the numerous other pilots involved would substantiate a different conclusion.

I. None.
