that she had in May, said it was in the first- two weeks. I said I would call her back. Called her back and told her it was 3 May she wanted to know if it was solved and I said yes it had been evaluated as the satellite ECHO II.

She said that was not the one she meant, the one I was talking about was the first satellite she had ever seen. The other report she and her sister made had three observations and would I please look it up and tell her what the evaluation was.

Called her back and informed her that her sighting of 18 May 65 was an aircraft. She then talked to Major Quintanilla regarding the UFO program in general. She wanted to know why the DOD turned down Maj Q's request to be on Greg Wallaces show. Maj explained that there were too many requests for this nature for just one person to handle and that yes he had told Greg that he would be on the program if DOD approved. But DOD said that if he did it for Greg then he must do it for all the others. Major explained that there were only the four of us on the project.

She wanted to know if we thought she was a crackpot. Replied no. She wanted to know about satellites and why they sometimes appeared irregular lighting when passing overhead. Major explained that some of these were rocket boosters, fragments etc and that they were tumbling and that the light did not always show on them when they did this. They were quite satisfied with the answers Major Quintanilla gave them.

The sky is open above my house and yard. Trees surrounding the property are quite high. I would say about sixty feet.

I thought I saw a pipe, gray or dark on the first light. I'm not sure so didn't include it on the drawing. I can't remember if I saw while looking through the Binoculars or not.

Heard the rumble of jets.

The stars were clearly visible, but some streaks of cloud mists,

Would have answered some but now very busy.

Explaining the light I saw, I have hardly can air past for few years, with an air route over my house. I have watched them turn on these lanklights on countless times which look like they sweep the ground and then rise straight ahead of them.

The light that come from the object come straight down, the color was legit gold and was only on about a or 3 sec. and then went off.

The pipe with I will call it coming from the light was a spray or brown was not lite up. and was only seen through binoculars of the other a object so were identical but seem to be smaller or higher.

Mr. [redacted] called and gave me the information described in this form. As he said it looked like a light on an airplane but had no wing lights, or better yet it looked like a satellite. Then he asked if we had any satellites in the area tonight because that is sure what it looked like. I got all of the information from him that I [redacted] thought was required to complete the form. [redacted] The weather listed was obtained from the Patterson weather station at 21:55. Mr. [redacted] did not ever call the light an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO). He seemed more interested in finding out if we had any satellites out in the area tonight.
