Called and wanted to know when her sighting was that she had in May, said it was in the first two weeks. I said I would call her back. Called her back and told her it was 3 May she wanted to know if it was solved and I said yes it had been evaluated as the satellite ECHO II. 

She said that was not the one she meant, the one I was talking about was the first satellite she had ever seen. The other report she and her sister made had three observations and would I please look it up and tell her what the evaluation was. Called her back and informed her that her sighting of 18 May 65 was an aircraft. She then talked to Major Quintanilla regarding the UFO reports. She wanted to know why the USAF turned down her request to be on Greg Wallace's show. Maj explained that there were too many requests for this nature for just one person to handle and that yes he had told Greg that he would not do it for others if he did it for Greg when he must do it for all the others. Major explained that there were only the four of us on the project. She wanted to know if we thought she was a crackpot. Replied no. She wanted to know about satellites and why they sometimes appeared irregular lighting when passing overhead. Major explained that some of these were pocket beacons, fragments etc and that the light did not always show on them when they did this. They were quite satisfied with the answers Major Quintanilla gave them.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a diagram and instructions for sketching the motion and path of a UFO sighting. Specifically, it asks the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects and any changes in direction during the course of the sighting.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass diagram to show in what direction the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

25. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The sky is open above my house and I would say about sixty feet. I thought I saw a pipe, gray or dark on the first light. I'm not sure so I didn't smell it or the drawing. I can't remember if I must while looking through the Binoculand or not. 

I heard the rumble of jets. 
The stars were clearly visible, but some streaks of cloud mist.
Would have any answered sooner but was very busy.

Explaining the light I see, I have dated an air photo that has been years, with an air density over my house.

On the 27th of theses marked items they sweep the ground and then rise straight ahead of them. The light that came from the object came straight down; the color was light green and was only on about a 3 sec. and
The pipe which I would call it coming from the light was a longer brane was not like tip and was only seen about 1/2 min. I seem as not a get up a perfect one for it. But something strangely and extremely differ.

This image appears to contain a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes an illustration with instructions for marking the position and movement of a UFO sighting. There is also a compass rose illustration and handwritten text describing the reported sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

20. Draw a figure of the path a that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

NORTH TO SOUTH. ACROSS AS NOTED ABOVE. ASTOUNDING PATTERN.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _____ Day _____ Month _____ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting.

[Redacted] called and gave me the information described in this form. As he said it looked like a light on an airplane but had no wing lights, or better yet it looked like a satellite. Then he asked if we had any satellites in the area tonight because that is what it looked like. I got all of the information from him that I thought was required to complete the form. The weather information was obtained from the Patterson weather station at 21h55. He did not ever call the light an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO). He seemed more interested in finding out if we had any satellites out in the area tonight.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn schematic diagram and text. The schematic diagram appears to show the motion of an observed object, with labels indicating the object was "sighted in the northeast, moved due south, and disappeared moving due east". The text below states that "ONE ONLY" object was observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please draw on the curved line to show how the object was moving from the horizon (skyline) Place a "+" on the line to show where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show where you last saw it. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
OBJECT WAS SIGHTED IN THE NORTHEAST, MOVED DUE SOUTH, PAUSED AND DISAPPEARED MOVING DUE EAST

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? ONE ONLY
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
