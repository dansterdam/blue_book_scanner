Dear Major:

I finally got around to calling who turned in the sighting of May 26, 1964. The sighting was made from a location I am fairly familiar with myself---the parking lot at Sears in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was just a few blocks from the Observatory. On a very clear day, one could see the aircraft from Logan Airport and also from Bedford. He indicated that this was a very clear day with about 0.4 cumulus coverage. He was in the parking lot with his young two year old son and had been watching some Fairchilds high in the sky, and since his son had been restive in the car, he suggested that they both look up at the sky at the airplanes, and it was at that time that he saw this strange elliptical object go across the sky from about ten degrees to the northeast of the horizon to about forty degrees above the southwest horizon where it was cut off the roof of the Sears stores. The duration of the sighting was only three or four seconds, and the object moved about fifty or sixty degrees during that time. The statement made in his original letter that the object was moving from 1000 to 3000 seconds of arc per second at a time is erroneous; he was basing that on any misalignment of Baker-Nunn camera tracking rates.

He had been one of the men I employed as a satellite tracker in Iran; he is a very reliable fellow and not excitable. The net result of the rather long phone call with him is simply that the sighting still remains unidentified, and there is no basic discrepancy between the data contained in his letter of May 29, 1964 and that given many months later by telephone. Although there was one witness, he is entirely reliable and was actually trained as an observer, was a pilot, and operated a satellite tracking camera for three and one half years in Iran. It is for this reason that I took the time to talk with him as closely as I did. In my phone call he talked entirely from memory and had no notes since he no calls caught him entirely by surprise. Yet, except in minor points, the account was identical with that given in his original interview. For the record, it might be good to go over a few of the essential points. He said he was fairly cynical about the nature of flying saucers although he had experience with a man who had seen, just a few months prior to that, a fast, flat object which hovered in the sky and had a falling leaf motion but wasn't falling.

[Handwritten note at bottom of page appears to read: He was a little mixed up in his directions - but not 13 great everywhere - 180° out of place]

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Immediately after he had this experience in the Sears parking lot, he made rough pencil notes and later made a more extensive resuming which he included in the letter. The time he stated was 1943 but this was Z time. It was actually 3:43 P. M. Eastern Daylight Saving Time under very good conditions of visibility.
Here are some items:

The trajectory was completely straight. It did pass behind cumulus clouds but did not leave a contrail. At about the same time, there was a contrail that was left by a high flying plane. There was no noise and no trail whatever.

At first he thought it was a plate in a thermal. However, he decided it couldn't be a plate because it passed behind a cumulus cloud. Further, he couldn't see where the thermal would have come from, and the object wasn't flipping as it would in a thermal. He thought he could see an edge to the object which was not fuzzy. It seemed cocked toward him, and there seemed to be a demarcation between top and bottom. When asked what he would have put up in the sky to simulate the object, he said he would have put up two pearly white picnic plates glued together. He said object had no bumps on it at all. He has no idea at all of what it might have been. He said that if it was an aerodynamic in nature, it should have been in a turn because of its cocked position, but it flew in a completely straight line. He tried visualizing it as a sweptback plane but could not. The hind end was just about the same shape as the front--- a pretty good oval. He looked for a trail, and he looked for an apparent change in shape. He could see aircraft at great distances and identify them. He saw three twin-engine Fairchilds. He saw transports coming in towards Hanscom and he heard a transport shortly afterwards but no sound from this object. He did not observe through a window but was leaning out of the car trying to point out the transports to his son.

As far as color is concerned, he said the object was exactly the color of a metallic surface reflecting cumulus clouds. He put the cumulus at between 2500 and 8000 feet. Although he realizes he cannot tell distances and sizes, he had the intuitive feeling that the object was fifteen to twenty feet in diameter. As far as apparent size was concerned, it was one-third to one-half the size of the full moon. In appearance, the object appears a very thin ellipsoid with a major to minor diameter ratio of approximately 3.5 to 1.

He is naturally curious as to what the object might have been and wonders whether we could at this late date check radar. I informed him that there was very little chance of that, but that this could have been done had we had immediate capability and if the sighting had been reported immediately.

I quizzed him about the 1000 to 3000 seconds or per second, and he admitted that this was a gross miscalculation since this would give only about two degrees for the total duration of the sighting, and this is entirely out of the question. He also quickly dismissed the idea that it might have been a gull riding a thermal. He said this occurred to him at the time he was making the sighting, but it did not jibe with the facts.

So we have another unidentified that falls in the general pattern of rapidly flying discs in straight trajectories. Despite the shortness of observation, consider

There is a handwritten note at the bottom of the page that appears to read: "I know could not himself! Perhaps not too reliable"

weight must be given to the excellence of the observer who, in this case, was
trained for specific tracking of objects in the sky.

He will be in Washington during his State Department training, and if any further
questions arise, I can get in touch with him there.

Sir:

On Wendsday May 26 I observed something which I can only class as an unidentified flying object. Below given are the notes I made immediately after the sighting:

Place: Car-park in front of Sears & Roebuck Store, Mass. Ave., Cambridge.

Time: 19:43 hrs. [I checked my wrist-watch against WGBH time signal at 20:11 hrs. after the sighting.]

Met. Conditions: Estimated 5/10 cumulus, base est. 2,500', 1,000' vertical development. Visibility unlimited.

Appearance of object: Very thin ellipsoid as seen, major to minor diameter ratio approximately 3.5:1. Would estimate length of major axis between 1/3 to 1/2 full-moon diameter but did not see moon out at the time so it is a memory comparison.

Altitude: Object definitely was above the cumulus. Object was dead white, indicating reflection of cloud upper boundary, also I saw it disappear behind cloud. As base of cloud was definitely gray, were the object to have passed below the cloud it would have shown white against the background.

Course: Estimated ENE. [Position of north estimated from Sun-wrist-watch combination, allowing 15° for correction from DST.]

Speed: Appeared equivalent to 200 mph at 1,000'. Estimating from a different datum I should guess it between 1000 to 3000 seconds of arc per second.

Time visible: Disregarding short periods when object appeared behind clouds I probably tracked it for 35 to 40° of arc at which point it disappeared behind the roof edge of the Sears store.

I had sufficient time for observation to determine that the object was not a paper plate or cup being carried up in a thermal nor that it was an aircraft. During the entire time of observation the outlines of the object did not change indicating that it was maintaining its orientation in space. Its course was parallel to the major axis of the ellipsoid - this destroyed my initial hypothesis that it was a sea-gull in a thermal. A dawing of it is sketched in below:

[A small hand-drawn sketch of an oval/elliptical object with a dotted line suggesting an edge]

The dotted line is a suggestion of an edge or something and was in the position shown. It was not of great contrast to the rest. Generally the small visual angle of the object and the brightness of the white coloring or reflection was such that detail was difficult if not impossible to see. The whiteness was of the same quality as the bottom of an aircraft over snow or clouds; I saw a jet high up (leaving a contrail a few minutes before the sighting) with the same brilliant white reflected and had similar difficulty in trying to pick out engine pods.

There was no smoke trail from the object, nor did I hear any unusual sound. There was somewhere within the aural range a reciprocating engined aircraft, which I didn't see, but which was the cause of my looking up.

Three Fairchild military transport planes in formation were seen just before the sighting located probably over Woburn and turning left in an easy turn, presumably to join the Hanscom AFB landing pattern. They were out of aerial range but plainly identifiable under the clouds - this should give an idea of the visibility at the time.

My qualifications as an observer are as follows: Qualified RAF pilot in 1945, with approx 200 hours and holder of private pilot's license. College graduate, holder of a series of jobs in armament research and the aero-space field, both in design and production.

I also spent three and a half years in Iran as a satellite observer for Smithsonian Institution/NASA. We were operating there an optical tracking station equipped with a standard Baker-Nunn tracking camera. I am presently a writer-evaluator with MIT as shown on the letter head. My eyesight, last tested in a rough test was 20-20.

I am available (after Thursday, June 4) by telephone: [redacted]

Sincerely
