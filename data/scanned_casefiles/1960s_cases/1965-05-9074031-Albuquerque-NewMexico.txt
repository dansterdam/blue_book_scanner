Dear Sir, Forgive 
I am conscientiously your letter in regard to our report of the U.F.O. on May 23, 1965. There were no clear visible object, but there were some shine visible. They appeared to be moving very fast. They seemed to be of metallic material. They were seen by other observers also. I should like to give you more details if possible. Please let me know if you need any further information.
Yours very sincerely,
[Signature]

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text document. The document appears to be part of a report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

OCR Output:
There seemed to be between 8 to 10 single bright lights, flying approximately south, slowly. They ranged in altitude from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 feet. At times the objects changed directions radically, the some times turning 180 degrees without apparent difficulty. There seemed to be some sort of connection between the lights, much as if they were strung together. The time was approximately 9:00 pm on April 24th. The objects continued to be seen for maybe 20 minutes. There are positive things about the sighting, in that the observers were credible people, and the sighting was made over a considerable period of time which lends it validity. The same time (9:00 to 9:20 pm April 24th) a number of other people in the Albuquerque area also reported seeing similar objects.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document containing detailed text.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

The text states:
This case appeared to be authentic, even though the description of the object was very sketchy. The witness was a good observer and related a credible account. He claimed the object was a brilliant light source that made no noise, and hovered for ten minutes about 500 feet in the air. The UFO was observed by Charles, who was working in the field, and by his family members.

He was completely baffled by Charles' report and made routine inquiries. No further developments occurred.

Mr. Kelly believed the witness to be truthful, but emphasized that this was strictly a routine investigation and nothing more. It appeared to be a legitimate report, but there was insufficient data to draw any definitive conclusions.
