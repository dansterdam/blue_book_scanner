Rec from Dr. H                                    20 Sept 66

22/1829/165                                       Mar. 21, 1966

Dear Mr. Thygalk,

I am answering yours letter in regards
to our report of the U.S. on May 22, 1965.

1. At the time of our observation there
were no stars visible. The sky was
overcast. The objects were different
from a star in that they were
egg-shaped & did not twinkle or
shine. but glowed from within.

They flew in a V-shaped formation
- broke this formation only to al-
most halt, make a turn, & then
move northeast.

2. The objects covered only a small
portion of the sky as if there were
maybe 5 large objects flying
together in formation. Closest to
same as we would have it
covered. There was no sound.

There was no window & the sky
was overcast & your earlier note
details of the objects were very
large & far away & if you can

[Note: The last line appears to be cut off]

This is a handwritten document with cursive text. Here is the text I can read:

This is now substantiation of this object as they passed closely over water surface...

There seemed to be between 5 to 7 but they passed so quickly it could not be sure. They like would approximately the same size & shape, but again the outside the position...

Their glow was not surge but...

Since the observation, no solution has entered our minds. We are positive they were not planes. Because we had seen the south of us about the same time (nearly) with described their flight...

Some words are partially illegible or cut off at the edges of the page. The text appears to be describing an observation of some unidentified flying objects.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

the lines slowly approached sun west
of the southern "sky circle". They
went out of sight northwest of
view. We were sitting changing our
forms. Chairs saw we were there
looking into the sky as we talked.
It was completely dark as we
probably would not have seen
them.

4. We have not witnessed anything
similar to the event before or
since.

We are glad to be of assistance to
you. If there are further questions
our office will place the help. The people
that were here at the time feel
the same. They were Mr. & Mrs.
                    5625 N.W. Albuq.

My other story was mentioned again
among. I believe they meant
and wife instead of
Friendly
                    Yours
