May 19: Capt. RCE Ainsworth, commander of an Air Traffic Airways Comet jet is reported that he and his crew had seen a flying saucer while flying across the Sedan that morning.

Capt. Ainsworth said he saw the "saucer" just after dawn. It was flying parallel to the Comet aircraft.

"It was like a very large green fire with a shower of red sparks behind it," he said. He called his navigator, first officer and engineer officer, who all saw the object and agreed it was either a large, luminous green object or a meteor.

May 4, Dll City, Pa. -- Mr. and Mrs. Claude and others sighted a missile-like object about 8:30 p.m. which appeared to be controlled. At Mayfield Heights, Ohio, (about 30 miles from Cleveland) a model rocket-like object was followed closely. At another place a bright object changed in color from a bright fire-red to green.

And here is a dark, drawn-out light over the area. There also seemed to be a large ball-like section in the scene of action. The higher it climbed (towards the w/w), the longer it appeared in shape.

The UFO was visible 5-8 minutes.

Two hours later in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, (about 30 miles from Cleveland), Marilyn Kimberly, a biology student, and her father observed a very bright, yellowish-white object from E to W.

No Case (Information Only)                                   7 May 1961

Astronomers at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia were
seeking a solution to the mystery of a photograph taken of a strange
object seen glowing with blush in the night sky near
Gundagai on May 7, 1961. Assistant N.S.W. government astronomer
Mr. J. Hale said he could not explain what it could be. I after having seen the photograph: "I don't know
what it was." The photograph was taken by Naval rating
mechanic, a four minute exposure shot with a high quality camera.
The shape of the object was generally circular with a "nose" effect
pointing upward.

World Chronicle on Mysterious Celestial Objects, the OVNI in Poland (continuation)

1. Flying Saucers in the Karpathian regions
Source: extract from the book FLYING SAUCERS by Yanosh Tora(?); original text in the Polish language

At the end 1958, a weekly D. S. published a series of articles on the subject of flying saucers. The direct cause of the publications was news that arrived from the Karpathian region. The majority of the inhabitants of the village of Melorca (gp. ?) and Sarecech (gp. ?) saw some flying saucers. To check up on these observations the editorial office sent to the spot a crew consisting of several persons. Some of them were believers in these things and others were against the idea.

A number of stories by eye witnesses were published. We will sight 2 of them.

1. the Testimony of Mr. R. G.

We were living at the time in M. near Z. afternoon of January 1957 my wife called me to the garden. I saw in the sky to the mountain, directly in front of me in the direction of the village East Edna, three clear balls. They were of the same size and geometrically arranged. The next day my wife called me to the balcony a second time. I saw the sun located in an unusual place. At first, it was very difficult to determine which of the two balls one of the strange balls, however, was another color--blood red, and colored everything around it. I do not remember any longer when and how this phenomena disappeared.

2. the testimony of Mrs. K.

All of a sudden Mrs. K. perceived a flying object, round and silver-white, bulging out on the bottom similar to a hat. It was flying towards the village in an oscillating motion and was shining like a mirror exposed to the sun. Mrs. K. supposed that it could be at an altitude of about 500 meters and have a diameter of about 20 meters. (* bulged cut above) The object was completely flat on the bottom and in Mrs. K. could not distinguish any detail on the rounded upper part. At a certain moment the object turned around and went very high in the direction of North East towards the village of Bora Zubra (gp. ?) at a very high velocity. It then disappeared between two mountains and Mrs. K. astonished, supposed that it was a new kind of aircraft, not having heard anyone speak about flying saucers.

6:00 in the evening.

1. It was a case of an object of cylindrical form like a cigar which remained suspended, without being over the village of Galisk Mouseveski (?) situated at 40 kilometers to the west of Warsaw. The object was very brilliant, blinking, after a time, it began to move slowly. It changed its position to horizontal (ly) and shifted towards the west. The observation lasted about a half an hour and it took place over the center of the railroad switching yards. //This report was edited by one of my acquaintances, Madam Stenestava Roskowitz who was a witness to this observation along with a number of other persons.

As far as I know the Astronomical Observatory of Warsaw has some details concerning this object, but I do not know what twaddle they invented to explain this apparition.
