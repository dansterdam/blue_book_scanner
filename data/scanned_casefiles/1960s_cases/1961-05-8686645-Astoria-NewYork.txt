10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj. was stationary and appeared to have a run rectangular shape. After a few minutes a much smaller obj. seemed to "shoot" out of bigger obj. It was heading NE. Came out very fast then slowed down. Large obj. was pink and seemed to disintegrate.

11. COMMENTS
Witness reports this obj. was observed for 30 min in a lightly populated area. He was apparently the only person who saw it. Witness also states that the "significant" in a both eyes, which could account for impressions of witness. Due to the nature of corroborating testimony, this sighting is evaluated as insufficient data.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical

□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation

Tuesday, May 23, 1961, observed from windows, third floor, 35-11, 28th Avenue, Astoria, Long Island, New York, between 5:15 AM and 5:25 AM was a round light east of observation point; stationary, and centered in area of Dilor Stch Company, 75-20 Astoria Boulevard, Jackson Heights, opposite at First to be a star, although not high enough in atmosphere.

The sky ceiling was blue, clear; visibility extensive. It appeared as if man were circumventing upper part of "sighted globe". ILLUSTRATION EIGHT

[A hand-drawn sketch of a circular object is included]

Felt it was an optical illusion. To verify assumption turned eyes away from "globe" for few minutes and then returned vision to same. It still revealed impressions of same half circumference and sides of "globe", at 5:20 AM an unidentified object was released from west side of "globe", travelling northwest at the direction of Port Schuyler. Oral and written reports (action similar to sheet target release), gliding to a normal aerodynamic glide in descent to earth, or final destination. From observation point will remain in shape, brighter in color.

Dear Sirs:

This letter is being written at the suggestion, and recommendation, May 24, 1961, Public Information Division, Secretary of Air Force, New York, at "China data telephone" on Tuesday, May 23, 1961. The directive given over the phone was that report should be addressed to:

Before reporting observed object with to point out that writer is far-sighted and possesses astigmatism both eyes.

Tuesday, May 23, 1961, observed from windows, third floor, 35-14, 26th Avenue, Astoria, Long Island, New York, between 5:15 AM and 5:25 AM was a round light east of observation point; stationary, and centered in area of Blvd. Patch Company, 75-29 Astoria Boulevard, Jackson Heights, appearing at first to be a star, although not high enough in atmosphere.

The sky ceiling was blue, clear; visibility extensive. It appeared as if ILLUSTRATION BELOW:

[A hand-drawn sketch of a circle with "North", "West", "East", and "South" labeled]

Felt it was an optical illusion. To verify assumption turned eyes away from "globe". For few minutes and then returned vision to scene. It will revealed impression was half circumventing sides of "globe", Gravsline (graveline?) at 5:20 AM an unidentified object was released from west side of "globe", traveling northeast. In the direction of Fort Schuyler. Grid similar to a normal merplane (?) from incest to earth, or final destination. From appearance in color, released "disc" appeared round in shape, brown in color.

Coinciding with object release, a flock of pigeons (approximately twelve) flew from the direction of New York City northheast toward Port Schuyler at normal commercial plane height. Simultaneously, west of observation point an aeroplane, unidentified, at commercial transect levels, came from the west heading in direction of/and underneath the lighted "globes". To the naked eye, the plane was not seen in transit, red flashing, red lights blinking but could be heard to have what appeared to be helicopter propellors.

In viewing the lighted "globes" between 5:20 A/M and approximately 5:45 A/M it struck in size and started to shift to another observation point.

During dismissal in 5:55, entry fill an newspaper lighted "globes". This film form obtained, in observed a mind, that what First Purely appeared to be a beam circumventing "globes", could have been a chemical helium either mechanically tied for release of flying "disc", or perhaps an outside coating of lighted "globes" contacting atmospheric elements.

Not being mechanically, or scientifically trained, hope this detailed report will prove of interest and benefit.

Yours very truly,
