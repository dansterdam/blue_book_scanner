Dear Sirs:

At about five to seven, (Central Standard Time) age 14, who lives at out of his house and saw a cigar-shaped object to the S.W. (some north east) at a sixty degree angle. We show in the following a drawing of the objects.

The object was of whitish silver in color and about 30 to 40 feet in length at what we could tell at its altitude which in my opinion was close to a thousand feet. The width (width) was from 15 to 20 feet from what we could tell.

The speed of the object is unknown, depending on the speed of the object, but is guessed to be about one hundred miles an hour. The object hovered, then jerked and then sped away in an easterly at about a thousand miles an hour.

Mike, then came to my house where he showed me the object. The object disappeared after about two minutes just below the roofline of a house across the street.

We ran to the corner which took about ten seconds to again see the object. Just before it disappeared completely from sight, just before the roof line of the house mentioned, the object hovered, dropped a few degrees and gained speed rapidly. There was some connected with the object, and I.

are both Boy Scouts in Troop 73 of Richardson and we give you our scouts honor that this is not a hoax or optical illusion. The sky was clear and three was a stiff wind easily visible. We believe it is not a weather balloon because of the wind direction and the sky.

If you want more details either call or write to.

Thank you for reading this letter.
Sincerely yours,
