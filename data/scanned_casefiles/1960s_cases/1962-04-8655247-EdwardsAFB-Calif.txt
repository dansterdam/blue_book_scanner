X-15 PILOT SHOWS HIS FILM
How Joe Walker nearly broke the news

[The rest of the text is partially legible, but I'll transcribe what I can clearly read:]

I [first few words illegible]... that when he developed a film, there were spots on it which he could not explain. Joe Walker, after this, went to the North American Aviation Company and showed the film to some people there.

[Several paragraphs follow, but significant portions are difficult to read completely]

At the bottom of the page, there's a note that appears to read:
"JOE WALKER HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED AS UFO SIGHTING OFF A US AIRCRAFT, ANALYSIS OF FILM INDICATES UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON TOP OF X-15 LED TO INVESTIGATION"

The page is numbered "3" at the bottom center.

AUGUST 1962 Forging Military Spacepower

Record X-15 Flight Brings White New
Earns AFSC Major First
Astronaut Wings In Comd
And 2nd 'Primus' Honor

When Maj Robert M. White, famed
X-15 pilot, pushed his tiny rocket
powered research craft to an altitude of
314,750 feet, he became more than a
weekend pilot; he became a national observer
His more obvious accomplishments
included becoming the first man to
qualify as an astronaut in a winged
aircraft and becoming the first Air
Force Systems Command member to
wear astronaut wings

To earn the astronaut wings, Major White had to reach
an altitude of 50 miles. He bettered
this mark by 9.6 miles in a flight which
lasted only 11 minutes after the X-15
was released from the B-52 mother aircraft.

The historic flight shattered an earlier
X-15 altitude record jointly held by
Major White and National Aeronautics
and Space Administration test pilot Joe
Walker. The previous record was in the neighborhood of 250,000 feet.

As Major White figuratively gave the
X-15's 57,000 pounds of thrust a kick
in the pants, he nosed the craft upward
in the sharpest angle of climb yet attempted in the X-15's program. The
liquid fueled rocket engine burned 71
seconds and a maximum speed of
3,784 mph was attained at an altitude
of 116,000 feet.

The flight had been originally
programmed for 282,000 feet with a
maximum speed of 3,500 mph. The
flight as planned would have reached
an altitude of 53.4 miles, more than
enough for the award of astronaut
wings.

Shortly after the flight, Major White
was flown to Washington, D. C. where
he was awarded his astronaut wings by
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Curtis E.
LeMay in a Pentagon ceremony on
July 18. Mrs. White was present for
the occasion and pinned on the major's
new wings.

On the same day, President Kennedy
presented the major and three other
X-15 pilots, Scott Crossfield, Joe
Walker, and Robert M. White, the
National Collier Trophy for outstanding achievements in the X-15
flight.

EDITORIAL

Effects Of Nuclear Weapons

One of the reasons for this year's series of US atmospheric nuclear tests, as President Kennedy said last March, was to advance our knowledge of nuclear weapon effects. This knowledge is extremely important to the Air Force Systems Command. Because our weapon systems must operate effectively in a nuclear environment and they must be effective against enemy weapon systems.

A clear understanding of nuclear effects is necessary to solutions of problems related to survival of the retaliatory force's hardened missile and communications sites, to destruction of enemy re-entry vehicles, and to hardening of our re-entry vehicles against enemy actions.

When the moratorium on nuclear testing began in 1958, it was, of course, necessary to redirect the Air Force Special Weapons Center's nuclear effects research program. Faced with urgent requirements for effects data, the Special Weapons Center had, where possible, to find ways other than by actual testing, to provide the needed information.

The Center made significant progress in finding new sources of effects data during the moratorium years. A great many theoretical investigations were conducted with the aid of high speed digital computers. Laboratory simulation techniques were developed as a relatively inexpensive means of studying certain effects.

Literally hundreds of experiments, which could be considered as small scale effects tests, have been conducted at the Center. The experiments all have been non-nuclear and have taken place under controlled laboratory conditions. Many more will take place in the months to come as we begin operations in our new nuclear warfare research laboratory.

Nuclear effects research has had and will continue to have an impact throughout AFSC. As President Kennedy said: "We are spending great sums of money on radar to alert our defense and to develop possible anti-missile systems . . . on the communications which enable our command and control centers to direct a response . . . on hardening our missile sites shielding our missiles and warheads from defensive action and providing them with electronic guidance systems to find their targets.

"But we cannot be certain how much of this preparation will turn out to be useless, blacked out, paralyzed or destroyed by the complex effects of nuclear explosions."

Along with full scale tests like those conducted in the Pacific this year, Small Weapons Center nuclear theoretical work and laboratory effects simulation will help provide the certainty the Air Force may need to survive and operate in the environment of a nuclear detonation, whether on earth or in space.

Building Best Enlisted Leadership
Is Role of Senior NCO Academy

Since 1955, more than 4,000 non-commissioned officers have graduated from the Air Force Systems Command AFB in Albuquerque, N. M.

Advanced and military training are combined at the academy in a hard-hitting program designed to equip noncommissioned officers with Air Force responsibilities at a time in history when demands on leadership, moral responsibility and military know-how are the greatest of all time.

More than seven years ago, the Air Force recognized the need for further professional training for NCOs. Such training began at the Air University's Extension University Programs at the Squadron Officer School, Air Command Staff School, and the Air War College.

With the dawn of the ballistic missile and space age, already breaking, it was apparent that the Air Force was going to need the very best NCOs with the very best training.

Headquarters USAF authorized academy training for NCOs, with the scope and nature of courses to be determined by the Air Training Command. The commander of what then was the Air Research and Development Command such-ized establishment of a Senior NCO Academy for the science, engineering and testing arm of the Air Force.

Kirkland was selected as the academy site because of the base's central location and availability of adequate dormitory and classroom facilities.

The first class of 62 master sergeants entered training in January, 1955. They were the first of more than 4,000 men who have come, not only from the Systems Command, but from the Air Force Academy, Air Defense Command, Headquarters Command, Air Force Communications Service and even the Army.

Today the academy graduates eight classes, or 600 men a year. Courses are six weeks long.

The basic concept of the academy is that the noncom needs professional skill, not only in technical fields but in leadership, management, human relations, moral responsibility, pride in the service, and concern for the welfare of his colleagues and subordinates.

Six weeks at the academy are no vacation. There's hard work and lots of it. A military atmosphere prevails throughout the course. Academy instruction is vital to stimulate thinking, to develop initiative, to conduct after graduation. Emphasis is placed on correct military dress, appearance and bearing. There is instruction in drill and ceremonies, Air Force customs, courtesies and protocol.

Academic objectives are achieved through instruction in effective oral and written expression, problem solving, leadership techniques, management principles and techniques of leadership, interpersonal relations, USAF and Systems Com-

Other outstanding graduates receive achievement certificates. Each graduate receives a distinctive diploma, symbol of achievement through diligent individual application to a demanding course of study.

A student's work day begins at 5:15 in the morning. Until five in the evening, he is busy with drill, academic instruction and sports. Evening study hours are from 6:30 to 9:30. Students have to be in quarters at 11:30 each night except Saturdays and evenings preceding academy recognized holidays.

Saturday begins at 5:15, but students normally are free from duty by noon.

The academy is staffed by two officers, 15 noncommissioned officers, two civilian secretaries, supply, administration and in the audio-visual program, and two civilian secretaries.

Commandant is Lt. Col. John S. Albright, who holds a BS degree from the University of Maryland, and MA degrees from Maryland and Denver Universities.

(Continued from page 1)

over the more glamorous and spectacular news, the exclusive AFSC Aerospace Primus Club quietly announced another significant first for Major White. He had become the first man twice honored by that organization. The announcement received little notice.

A charter member of Aerospace Primus Club, Major White's membership on the basis of an altitude record he made with the X-15 on August 12, 1960, he reached an altitude of 136,200 feet, less than half his recent record.

Known as the most exclusive club on earth, the Aerospace Primus Club was established Aug. 26, 1960 by Gen. B. A. Schriever, AFSC commander. There were 12 charter members, and new members have been added.

Objectives of the club—stated in its charter—are to promote original accomplishment in the discovery, development, testing and use of techniques and equipment in furtherance of the aerospace program and to honor first individuals to attain or participate in notable achievements deemed to be of historic significance.

Membership in the club is restricted to military and civilian members of the Air Force who have accomplished significant aerospace firsts. A special Primus Club team, made up of top military and civilian officials at HQ AFSC, meets as required to consider new members. All nominations are submitted to the AFSC commander for approval.

Charter members of the Primus Club were recognized for three spectacular aerospace accomplishments during the period of Aug. 9-19, 1960. Speaking of that brief period, General Schriever said, "We have achieved more important aerospace firsts than at any time in history."

The first of these was with the successful launch of Discoverer XIII into orbit. On Vandenberg AFB, Calif., the following day, the Discoverer XIII capsule became the first object in history to be recovered from orbit. On the same day, there were three successful Polaris launches.

On Aug. 16, Capt. Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., performed a second breaking parachute jump for which he received his second Distinguished Flying Cross. The next day, a Bomarc missile sought and destroyed a QB-47 drone aircraft.

The period of unprecedented success reached a climax on Aug. 19 when Capt. Harold E. Mitchell's C-119 crew made the first successful aerial catch of an object returning from space, the Discoverer XIV capsule.

In addition to Major White, the period saw the first parachute descent by a capsule with metal recovery and Captain Kittinger were selected as charter members of the Aerospace Primus Club.

General Schriever personally praised the individuals singled out and presented them with inscribed plaques on Aug. 26, 1960.

The first which brought Primus Club recognition was Capt. Harold E. Kittenger's first step that was followed by a 102,800 foot descent to earth. Stepping from the open gondola of a balloon high above the New Mexico desert, the plucky captain free-fell 85,300 feet before his parachute opened. During the free-fall period, 4 minutes 38 seconds, he reached a speed of 614 mph.

DFC in 1957 when he rose to an altitude of 96,000 feet in an enclosed bal-

loon gondola. His 1960 parachute descent shattered a jump and free-fall record he had established in November 1959 when he was awarded the 1959 Harmon Trophy.

The much publicized aerial catch of the XIV capsule earned C-119 aircraft commander Captain Mitchell and his entire crew Primus Club honors. Colonel Alvan N. Moore, 6594th Test Wing commander, also became a charter member of the club for his part in the historic space recovery mission.

Members of Captain Mitchell's "Pickle Nine" crew included Capt. Raymond A. Apaka, co-pilot; Lt. Robert G. Grams, navigator; Tsgt. Louis F. Banning, SSgt. Augustine Harmon, SSgt. Arthur P. Hurst, SSgt. Wendell King.

On Aug 12, Major White set a new
force record in the X-15 and an Air
Force communications balloon, Echo,
into orbit.

On August 16, Capt. Joseph W. Kit-
tinger, Jr., performed a record breaking
parachute jump from a height of 102,800
feet, using a new type of gondola bal-
loon gondola. His 1960 parachute
record he had established in November
1959, For that accomplishment, he was
awarded the 1959 Harmon Trophy.
The much publicized aerial catch of
the XIV capsule earned C-119 aircraft
commander Captain Mitchell and his
crew high praise. The crew included
Alvan N. Moore, 6594th Test Wing
commander, also became a charter
member of the club for his part in di-
recting aerial recovery operations.

Members of Captain Mitchell's "Pol-
lux" Mercury crew included Capt. Rich-
mond A. Apsis, co-pilot; Lt. Robert
G. Coats, navigator; NSgt. Louis P.
Beaulac, MSgt. Alphonse Herron, NSgt.
Arthur P. Hurst, MSgt. Wendell King.

The feat which brought Primus Club
membership to Captain Kittinger started
with a first step that was followed by a
102,800 foot descent in earth. Stepping
from the open gondola of a balloon
high above the New Mexico desert, the
dusk captain free-fell 5,300 feet be-
fore his parachute opened. During the
descent, which lasted 4 minutes, he
reached a speed of 614 mph.

Captain Kittinger received his first
DFC in 1957 when he rose to an alti-

tude of 96,000 feet in an enclosed bal-
loon gondola. His 1960 parachute
descent was the first of its kind and
earned him a top rung on the ladder of
space flight accomplishments.

AIC George W. Donahue, AIC Lester
L. Beals and A2C Daniel R. Hill,
Capt. of the Discover capsule—
crewmen of the Mercury capsule's
17th Polar orbit—was accomplished at
an altitude of 8,500 feet. Captain
Mitchell sighted the capsule parachute
dead ahead of his aircraft at an altitude
of about 16,000 feet.

A total of about 10 minutes were
available to make the catch within the
limits of the aircraft's operational alti-
tude. The capsule's descent was just
heart breaking six inches.

A second attempt, hastily executed,
missed by as much as two or three feet.
But, the third time was a charm and
luckily so. Two decks of scattered
clouds at about 7,000 feet could have
made a fourth pass impractical.

Three of the new members honored
at AMD, TSgt Lenore M. Vigars and
SSgt. William V. Vargas and Ray E.
Sego, were recognized for their out-
standing service. They were selected for
membership on the basis of being the
first paratescue scuba team to recover
a space capsule.

Shortly after the Discover XXV
capsule plummeted into the Pacific
Ocean, on June 18, 1961 the three ARS
scuba divers performed its 1st from an
altitude of 23,000 feet and at a speed of
535 mph on June 6, 1961. He was the
first Air Force member to perform this
operation. In addition to Primus Club
recognition the feat earned him a DFC.

The fifth and final man of those re-
cently selected for Primus Club mem-
bership, Air Force Capt. Virgil I. Gris-
som of NASA's astronaut team, has not
yet been presented the distinctive club
plaque.

Patrick AFB Solves Problem
Of Holiday Road Hazards

Each year during Labor Day week-
end a staggering number of Americans
become accident fatalities as they hurry
about to have one last summer fling.
Whether it's a trip to the beach for
swimming or fishing, or a visit to rela-
tives several hundred miles away, most
families use the highway to some ex-
tent during this period.

This increased traffic, fatigued drivers
who try to travel too far and the holi-
day spirit all add up to a deadly week-
end. Statistic prove the statement.

Last year concerned officials at Air
Force Missile Test Center came up with
a plan to give assigned personnel an
opportunity to really celebrate the long
weekend without adding to the already
of extensive travel.

A Labor Day sports festival was con-
ducted with competitions in fishing,
ping-pong, tennis, horseshoes, swim-
ming, diving, pool racing, bowling,
golf, baseball, softball, and yes, even
a water skiing show.

According to Col. Henry Dittman,
Patrick AFB commander, the program

could only be classified as an outstand-
ing success. More than 3,500 partici-
pated in the wide range of events.
Practically all base personnel, not a
single traffic accident involving AFMTC
personnel was reported and there were
no injuries of any type.

Rocket Club Announces
Annual Essay Competition

The National Rocket Club has an-
nounced its 13th annual national his-
torical essay competition on the his-
torical development of rocketry and
space exploration in the United States.
The Dr. Robert H. Goddard Historical
Essay Competition, in honor of the
famous American rocket pioneer.
Goddard, is open to all students and
members of the committee will serve as
judges for the contest.

The essay should cover any
significant aspect of the historical de-
velopment of rocketry and astronautics
and will be judged on originality and
scholarly merit. The may bring new in-
formation to light, or may cast a new or
different light on events or indi-
viduals influencing rocket technology
in the U.S.

The Rocket Club said essays should
be submitted by Nov. 1, 1962, to the
Goddard Historical Essay Competi-
tion, National Rocket Club, Suite 32,
1743 K Street, N.W., Washington 6,
D. C. Winner of the competition will
be announced at the Robert H. God-
dard Memorial Dinner on March 15,
1963, and a prize of $200 and an ap-
propriate trophy will be awarded.

Graduation Time

Commencement exercises for the
1962 class of residents and interns at
the USAF Hospital at Lackland AFB
recently were held in the hospital audito-
rium.

Twelve dental interns and 14 medical in-
terns, was the largest to complete train-
ing at the Lackland hospital since its
inception as the Air Force's first teach-
ing hospital in 1957.

AFMTC Donates Surplus
To Florida Schools

More than a million dollars worth of
electronic and related electrical equip-
ment was recently donated by the Air
Force to educational institutions by the

Schools, colleges, and universities
from all parts of the state benefited
from the $1,164,000 worth of surplus
property, most of which is earmarked
for educational use under a program
Under a program directed by the De-
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare, some Federal surplus property
may be acquired by certain institutions

OPERATIONS

Man's 'Pressurability' Tested
In Sealed Capsule Experiments

What is the optimum atmospheric composition and pressure for a variety of space flight mission profiles?

That question and others concerning man's respiratory intake and emission are under careful study in an environmental test cell in the Respiration Section of the $570th Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

The cell is a fabric structure built for AMRL by Goodyear Aircraft Corporation. Seven feet in diameter and 12 feet long, it is enclosed in a large pressurized chamber which simulates various reduced atmospheric pressures. The 850-pound cell was constructed under a contract with the Air Force agency.

Scientists are seeking to learn the optimal atmosphere processes necessary to keep astronauts and equipment operating efficiently and reliably during Project Apollo and other space missions. AMRL said. Prime areas of study deal with the possible variation of the gaseous environment with respect to the length of the trip or to effect a reduction in system complexity with subsequent improvement of reliability.

During testing, both chambers are pressured to prescribed points. The test cell differs only one-half pound of the standard sea-level chamber pressure, but could withstand different ratios to five psi, Goodyear Aircraft engineers said.

A 36-inch window in one end of the cell is used for without and within. The window is used by scientists to study the reactions of the test subject and by these inside to watch television.

Because of the composition of certain test atmospheres, a television set can be used inside the cell. A TV set is wheeled up to the window when the test subjects wish to watch it.

Fabricated at GAC's plant in Arizona, the cell was designed and assembled at the main plant in Akron, Ohio.

AF Academy To Get
Basic Research Lab

The Air Force will activate a basic
research laboratory at the Air Force
Academy near Colorado Springs, Colo.
on Oct. 1. The laboratory, under the
supervision of the Air Force Office of
Aerospace Research, will be the first
such facility to be established at a service academy.

The new laboratory will serve a dual
purpose. It will increase in-service
capability to conduct necessary basic
research programs and will provide a
means for select members of the
Academy's faculty and outstanding
cadets to collaborate with OAR scientists in actual research programs of interest to the Air Force.

Of the 131 members of the Academy's science faculty, 24 now hold
graduate degrees, 107 per cent
have master's degrees. Twelve per cent
of the latter have completed their doctoral course requirements. (AFNS)

RADC Man Gives
New Solution For
Radio Puzzler

A trans-horizon radio propagation
phenomenon that has puzzled radio engineers has finally been explained, thanks
to the research of Lt. Richard P. Cassman, assigned with Rome Air Development Center at Griffiss AFB, N. Y.

The solution came after Lt. Cassman
suffered from a paper presented by Lieutenant Cassman at the spring meeting of
the International Scientific Radio Union,
held at Georgetown University, Washington, D. C. Attended by world leaders in the radio field, the scientific
meeting was sponsored by the United
States National Commission of the International Scientific Radio Union and the
Institute of Radio Engineers.

Lt. Cassman is an electronics officer
in RADC's Electronic Warfare Laboratory, presented a paper titled "An Investigation of Anomalous Trans-horizon
Radiowave Propagation Over Irregular
Terrain."

His paper covered investigation of the
highly irregular trans-horizon radio
propagation phenomena which was observed for the past several years in
tropospheric scatter experiments held at
Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.

None of the theories previously proposed to explain anomalous propagation—or irregular extending of radio
energy waves—were able to explain this
particular phenomena. Additional research and experiments were necessary.
The necessary research, under sponsorship of the Air Force Cambridge
Research Laboratory at Bedford, Mass.,
was undertaken by Lieutenant Cassman
while working on his master of science
degree at Cornell University.

Cancer Detection
Seen As By-Product
Of Research In Human Speech

A yellow Springs engineer, Robert
G. Cameron, assigned to the Aerospace
Medical Division's Aerospace Medical
Research Laboratories was recently
credited a special act award for work
resulting in savings to the government.

The Air Force has awarded the Martin Company's Denver Division a $41,499 contract to design and test an
experimental prototype which eventually would be used to develop a solar
prolonged space flight.

The contract provides for the aerospace division of the Martin-Marietta
Corporation to conduct research, design
and development work on the proposed
photosynthetic life support system
for spacecraft.

A diagnostic technique which may
well lead to the effective detection of
early stages of cancer of the vocal
cords has evolved from a recently completed Air Force Cambridge Research
Laboratories pilot study involving research into the anatomy of human
speech.

While not a replacement for a physician's normal throat examination, the
procedure may serve as a screening test
for pathological conditions involving
growths of the larynx.

A patient would merely record his
voice, using an ordinary microphone,
reading standard phrases. Analysis of
the speech wave form by techniques
developed by AFCRL research Laboratories would sound the alarm in this
medical early warning system.

Tests were made which involved cooperation of 12 speakers selected
with the cooperation of Dr. Ralph M.
Gable of the Washington Medical
Center, Washington, D. C.

Cameron, an engineer in the training
staff, branch of the Behavioral Science Laboratory, worked evenings and
weekends, without pay, to place in
operation quickly a facility for visual
data processing.

He voluntarily designed a contract for electrical circuitry for the
laboratory's new program. Cameron
installed the job himself. The visual
data processing program involved
standard Air Force gunnery trainer,
using parametric amplifier, computer
vision system and relative position
computer, all of which were developed only for a complete flight simulator.

The contract, with volumes of data

testing and checkout of the entire
the equipment, despite omission of

Aerospace Medicine School
Of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks AFB,
Tex., is sponsoring agency for the
study.

Aerospace Division's School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks AFB, will
deliver a complete solar illuminated
photosynthetic experiment to the Air
Forces by the end of the year.

Work will be supervised by Dr. R. D.
Giffels, chief of Martin-Denver's life
sciences section. Dr. Gafferd started
last summer with the Arctic Aeromedicai Laboratory on a project called
POSE—Photosynthetic Oxygenation Illuminated by Solar Energy. The present
contract is an extension of that work.

Great Pains Taken To 'Prep' Man-Orbiting Atlas Boosters

When Col. Walter M. Schirra lifts off on a six-orbit space flight, scheduled for next month, his Project Mercury capsule will be boosted by a 120,000-pound thrust Atlas rocket. The shakedown, thorough and exhaustive to the limits of human and electronic capability.

Such a shakedown is necessary to provide maximum reliability in boosters used for the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's manned space flight program.

Every test, among the multi-thousand components that make an Atlas function, has been checked, tested, retested, and checked again. The some 100 "key" components - those which by a single failure could jeopardize the mission and the safety of the astronaut - are specially selected, specially handled, and examined before the unique Mercury flight.

It's a safe bet that an Atlas rocket wearing the Mercury decal has earned that label. It's equally certain that the US astronaut who gets a 360,000-pound thrust into orbit can depend on the maximum that engineers and controls can power to be as totally reliable as possible.

Consideration, painstaking Air Force-contractor team seeks to that end through the Project Mercury office undertakes the guarantee.

The man behind the desk behind the Atlas boosters for the Mercury program is Lt. Col. Robert H. Brundin, a West Pointer and veteran of B-52 and D-model Hound Dog test programs.

"The Atlas wasn't designed to boost a man," the says. "To gain the reliability we now have, we've had to go back and redesign the Atlas, do a lot more testing, and provide for more redundancy throughout the system. There hasn't been time for any of that."

"We chose to stay with the existing Atlas configuration as closely as possible," he says. "That way, we could take advantage of the testing already done to prove the Atlas as an ICBM."

Intensive and extensive Air Force testing has been, it hasn't measured up to Mercury requirements - or to the Air Force's satisfaction. A Mercury Atlas not only takes twice as many man-hours to fabricate as a Titan missile, it also gets more than three times the normal checkout time and attention.

Broadly speaking, the care lavished on Mercury boosters averages 60 to 90 days of nit-picking scrutiny. An ordinary Atlas, by comparison, undergoes about 20 days of tests.

Routed to Cape Canaveral, the Mercury-destined Atlas goes through shift testing operations on the pad, blue suites in the SSD Mercury directorate admit that there is a limit to the degree of reliability that can be attained in a system as complex as the Atlas. Random failure, for example, is a constant threat.

Because a margin between practical and theoretical reliability does not exist, Air Force officers and contractors managing the booster portion of the Mercury program have come up with an important "plus" designed to bridge that area of marginal reliability. This is the Mercury short-sensing, and monitoring system - "AS IS" in Air Force parlance.

"We've been shooting for a 99.5 per cent reliability in this system," Colonel Brundin says.

American astronauts know that the Atlas boosters used to push them into orbit are an early perfect as human engineering can make them. An Atlas marked for use in the Project Mercury program becomes a special bird and receives exhaustive series of tests from Air Force professionals.

The Project Mercury crew at the 6555th Air Gp, grappled with Astronauts John Glenn and S of Complex 14. The group picture was taken during the preparation for the MA-7 mission.

AFSWC Scouting Group, S To Sponsor Aerospace Edu

Three hundred outstanding New Mexico high school science and math students have a better understanding of AFSWC's educational requirements for the aerospace age, thanks to the Air Force Special Weapons Center.

Coming from cities and villages throughout the state which was the center of nuclear and missile technology, the teenagers spent three days with AFSWC scientists and engineers in Albuquerque during Armed Forces Week. They were the guests of the Center and Boy Scout Explorer Science Conference.

The about sensing was designed to safeguard the astronaut in the event anything malfunctions during powered flight. When trouble is detected, AS-IS activates mechanism that separates the spacecraft from the booster and parachutes the pilot to safety.

At Cape Canaveral, birdwatchers of the Air Force's 6555th Aerospace Test Wing stay with the Atlas and, along with the contractor representatives, make sure the batteries of tests conducted on the site. Colonel Brundin's Florida counterpart, Lt. Col. Robert R. Hull, takes charge of the blockhouse and is launch director for the countdown.

But with all the tests and the unrelaxing ascent on safety, an Atlas booster is never ignited in support of Mercury without a final review by the Safety Review Board, chaired by Capt. James Chamberlin, who has reviewed all the pertinent to that booster and subsequently certified that it is ready to put a man into orbit.

Second AF Symposium On Bionics
To Be Held In Dayton Next Year

A second Air Force-sponsored symposium on bionics will be held in Dayton, Ohio, Mar. 19-21, 1963. Sponsored jointly by AFSC's Aeronautical Systems Division and the Aerospace Medical Division, the three-day meeting is expected to attract more than 50 researchers from government, industry, research foundations and universities throughout the United States and Western Europe.

More than 50 researchers will discuss advancements in the new science of bionics at the first ASD sponsored symposium held in Dayton in September, 1960.

The science of bionics is the search, bionics is the science of applying knowledge of biological functions and principles of living organisms to the solution of engineering problems. This knowledge derived from living organisms is translated into mathematical terms, functions for use by engineers in modeling functions of living systems.

Bid Let To Develop
Weather-Safe System
Of Aircraft Control

A compact air traffic control system to guide pilots to safe landings in all types of weather in remote areas of the world moved closer to reality recently with award of a $6 million contract to the Radio Corporation of America, Burlington, Mass., by the Electronics Systems Division of the Air Force Systems Command.

The contract calls for one system being a precision air traffic control requirement for three systems, all to be completed by the summer of 1963. The Air Force visualizes a total requirement of 14 such systems for use at fields around the world.

Brigadier General Charles H. Terhune, commander of the Air Force's Emergency Mission Support System will give the Air Force a probe compatible with the FAA air traffic control system. With EMS, air traffic control communications and navigational aids will be ready for fast deployment in any emergency. Responsible for this project is AFSD's chief, Martin F. Peterson.

Each EMS will be housed in six vans. Each van will have its own electrical power supplies, air conditioning, initial spare parts, and inter-communication equipment. The system will be able to direct and land all types of modern aircraft every 2.5 minutes, under conditions of ceiling and visibility as low as half-mile visibility despite fog; moderate rain or snow.

A total of 24 aircraft will be under positive control over an airport under bad weather conditions and be able to land without delay.

The air transportable system will include a precision approach radar, ground control approach radar, flight rules (VFR & IFR), tower vans, communications, and a government-furnished, van-mounted TACAN navigation (AN/TRN 17).

'Face-Lifting' To Add
Radar Tracking Power

The Air Proving Ground Center will double the power of its prime radar tracking stations within the year. It was recently announced by Hq APGC.

Located on Eglin's Site A-20 will increase its power output to five megawatts following an electronic face-lifting later this year. At the present time, the 12-foot "dish," designated the FPS-16, has a peak power capability of one megawatt.

Mercury man-hours to the men who operate the Mercury man-to-space tracking work. It is the 17th, and last, station American astronauts pass over before making earth re-entry from orbit.

On the critical last orbits of the Friendship 7 and the Aurora 7 space capsules, the G and S Radar radar tracking stations provided vital information on the re-entry path of the astronauts.

The new increase in power for the FPS-16 will give a corresponding increased tracking capability to the station.

War College Associate Courses At
ASD Termed Highly Successful

The Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is one of four organizations originally selected to participate in a six-month test of the Air University's new accelerated War College associate course. Other bases involved were Langley AFB, Va.; Lincoln AFB, Nebr; and Maxwell AFB, Ala.

The volume, program, and the executive course was established for selected service duty senior officers and civil service employees of the Air Force. Since its beginning, the informal course has proved highly successful. It is now officially approved by USAF and is being implemented on a larger scale. Twenty new seminars were established in January 1962 and more are to follow.

The War College associate course is based on the premise that individuals who participate in the program have a desire to learn in order to improve their capabilities and qualifications for positions of greater responsibilities.

With this in mind, the course was designed to be more selective rather than a directed basis. Students who participate are permitted, as much latitude as possible in deciding the manner in which the course is conducted.

The course consists of four semesters of five months each, followed along the lines of the War College resident course. Each semester of the associate course seminar includes 20 chapters. Students study each lesson individually, and then meet for a weekly two-hour seminar, where the study assignment is discussed by all participants in the course.

Seminar discussions groups are conducted under a rotating chairmanship of the students and under permanent faculty guidance. Most of the Military participants are lieutenant colonels and above and civilians, grade GS 14 and above.

In addition to directed studies, student members must make two 10-minute oral presentations during each of two turns of study. A written report on suggested subject of 5,000 to 3,000 words is required at the end of each volume.

Upon finishing the course, students are given a year for completion of a thesis, which must be approved by the Air University. The complete course takes approximately two years.

Seminar number 3, at ASD, has completed the first three volumes and is scheduled to commence the last volume this summer. It will be among the first five in the Air Force to receive recognition for outstanding achievement in military education.

The chief reason for the associate course is that many senior officers would not have an opportunity to participate in the War College program because of the limited number of courses available for the resident course.

This accelerated course reduces the regular course from five to two years. Some of the areas studied under this program include international relations, strategy, current and future military strategy.

Lt. Nicolai Graduates
SOS With Distinction

Lieutenant Leland M. Nicolai, of ASD Directorate of Advanced Systems Planning, was honored recently upon graduation with distinction from Squad ron Officer School, Maxwell AFB, Ala.

Nicolai was one of 42, in a class of more than 900 students, who graduated with distinction.

Assigned to ASD's Flight Dynamics Division, Nicolai had previously attended the University of Oklahoma under AFIT program and received his M.S. degree in aeronautical engineering. He had received his bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1957.

Upon his return to ASD, Lieutenant Nicolai was assigned to the design analysis section of the aerospace vehicle design branch. In this assignment, he conducts design studies of futuristic aerospace vehicles.

Lieutenant Nicolai received commendations from Lt. Gen. Tromp Miller, Jr., commander of Maxwell AFB; Maj. Gen. C. H. Mitchell, vice commander of AFSC, and Maj. Gen. W. A. Davis, former commander of ASD.

Lt. Nicolai Graduates
SOS With Distinction

Lieutenant Leland M. Nicolai, of
the Directorate of Advanced Systems
(AFSC), was honored recently upon
graduation with distinction from Squd-
ron Officer School, Maxwell AFB, Ala.
Lieutenant Nicolai was one of 42, in a
class of more than 900 students, who
graduated with distinction.

He received the ASD Flight Dynamics
award by the Aerospace Research and
University of Oklahoma. Lt. Nicolai
is an aeronautical engineering officer
assigned to the Electronic Systems Di-
vision at ASD.

Upon his return to ASD, Lieutenant
Nicolai was assigned to the design sec-
tion of the aerospace vehicle design
branch. In this assignment, he
will be working on studies of futuristic
vehicle designs.

Lieutenant Nicolai received commen-
dation from Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Mor-
ris, commander of Maxwell AFB.

Contract To Develop Deep
Space Tracking Ability
Announced By Air Force

The Air Force recently announced
award of a $2.8 million contract to
Philco Corporation of America, Palo
Alto, Calif., for development of a criti-
cal surveillance device which will enable
the Air Force to detect and track man-
made satellites orbiting out in the dis-
tant ranges of the stars.

Personnel of Electronic Systems Divi-
sion's System 494 (popularly known
as Space Track) will handle procure-
ment and manage development of the
new deep space tracking system.

Besides a powerful telescope, the
project will employ the photo-
sensitive surfaces of an image orthicon
(TV-like) tube, coupled with data cor-
relation techniques to get a fast readout.

The system works like this: The
portion of the sky observed through the
telescope is focused on the face of an
image orthicon tube. The tube's sur-
face is made up of multiple photo-
sensitive cells like a checkerboard or
honeycomb or the TV tube, with each
section receiving independently to the
amount of light hitting it. Electronic
circuits, reading to each individual
section, instantaneously relay this mea-
sage.

The new tracking technique, "read"
this message and store it. The incred-
ible swiftness of electronic replicas the
former slow development of a chemical
printer. Further, the star background
is canceled out electronically. Then the
computer "brain compares one "look"
(scan) with the next so that any move-
ment of the star can be detected.
Extending the range of radar detec-
tion, the special device would not nec-
essarily be restricted to earth satellites.

ESD's Anthony Salvucci, 4961, pro-
ject scientist, said, "The optical-detec-
ting device will utilize electronic tech-
niques of analysis in order to give a
real time answer to the satellite sur-
veillance problem at long range."

So far, the system has tracked a
dozen wide ranging Air Force electronic
projects centered at Hanscom Field, til
dealing with the problems of command
and control of aerospace forces.

Rocket Society Speaker

Carl O. Horst, the X-15 research
plane's chief engineer at the Aeronau-
tical Systems Division, recently ad-
dressed the Northeast Ohio Division of
American Rocket Society at Cleveland,
Ohio. He spoke on the contribution of
the X-15 to testing and aerospace.

Horst told the group that the X-15 is
a blend of the ballistic missile and
winged aircraft and that it is made from
high-temperature materials like a metal
used in automobile exhaust pipes.

He has applied for a patent for an
aircraft wing based on bird flight
mechanisms and has published a book
titled, "Flapping and Soaring." He is
also past president of the Dayton
Audubon Society.

Inventory Transfers Net
Millions For Taxpayers

Transfer of articles of military in-
ventory from one service to another
has resulted in the savings of millions
of dollars for the taxpayers' money,
according to a report made by Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara to
President Kennedy on July 5.

Procurement of needed articles by
one of the services from the inventory
of another has proven to be a goal
mine, according to Mr. McNamara.

Instead of trying to procure a needed
article from civilian contractors, the
Army and Navy will first search the
inventory of the other service for the
item. This practice was described by
Secretary McNamara as "one of the
most fruitful ways to reduce the pro-
curement of inventories."

A sample of how the "transfers"
work was revealed in the recent Air
Force requirement for 323 new silver-
plated roller bearings. An overhaul
work would have cost $25,862. A search
among the inventories, however, showed
that the Navy had a supply of them
which were transferred to the Air
Force.

Education Pays

A scholar's dream has come true for
Carl D. Simmons, 34, a supervisory
aeronautical research engineer for the
Air Force's Flight Test Center at Ed-
wards AFB, Calif.

He recently started a year of salaried,
full-time study at the University of
Southern California for a master of
science degree, under an Air Force
career development program for pro-
moting civilian workers.

A Fresno State College graduate
(1955) and father of two, Simmons is
taking advantage of the Air Force's
the full-time study award in the three-
year-old Air Force career development
program.

For the last two years he has super-
vised various key test projects involving
the four-jet supersonic B-58 Hustler,
the Air Force's fastest bomber.

Simmons, a native Texan, has grown
up in Fresno since June 21, 1955 from
his job a bachelor of science degree in
mechanical engineering and mathe-
matics.

Research Pilot School At Edwards AFB
Grooms Students For Top Space Roles

Two large glass doors opening into a squat green building labeled with the words, "United States Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School," are the USAF gateway to space.

At the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB, Calif., selected test pilots are training to fly or work with tomorrow's aerospace craft.

The school offers two courses. One is the Experimental Test Pilot Course, which has been taught at Edwards for several years. The second, the Aerospace Research Pilot Course, is a new nine-month program designed to give highly advanced technological training ever offered in the Air Force, and is probably the most advanced and exacting formal aviation school in the world.

"What we are doing," Lt. Col. Robertson said, "is preparing pilots and project officers for this nation's future manned space program."

The school's students will undoubtedly fly in space and may well be eight leading future aerospace vehicles. Some will be associated with the many aspects of profect management for extreme altitude flight.

Applicants for the advanced course, which is the Aerospace Research Pilot Course or the US Naval Test Pilot School, are test pilots. They must be on active duty in the grade of lieutenant colonel or below and currently on flying status at a pilot. A minimum of 2,000 hours flying time and a degree or equivalent in engineering, a physical science, or related field is required.

"Instruction" is divided into four phases: Colored Howe said. "These are academic lectures, flying, simulation, and bioastronautics. The academic phase is conducted by military and civilian instructors with advanced degrees. Flying training is conducted in advanced aircraft, some of which will be modified to exhibit ballistic control, stability, and variable stability characteristics."

"For those areas of future space flight which cannot be demonstrated in present day aircraft, we have added the simulation phase where electronic flight simulators will approximate space conditions for the student."

Bioastronautic training will be conducted at the School of Aerospace Medicine, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Students will be familiarized with the physiological implications of flight in aerospace craft, and space, and related biomedical techniques.

"Finally, field trips will provide the student an opportunity to familiarize himself with allied space work being done by the military, US industry, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."

The article continues with details about a "Declaration Symposium" and mentions some specific individuals and their roles.

There is also a photograph of a young woman (identified as Blonde Wendy Capps, a Desert High School senior) and another photograph of an older man (identified as Col. Charles E. "Chuck" Rogers).

ACCENT ON PEOPLE

Determination, Drive And AF Aid
Help BSD Officer To Academic Top

Climaxing a 20-year climb to academic eminence, Ballistic Systems Division's Lt. Col. Vincent J. Bracha received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Southern California, graduate school of business administration.

The dark-haired, soft-spoken colonel was the only student in the school's graduate class of '62 to earn that distinction. His is the first Air Force officer ever to attain a doctorate from USC in the business administration field.

But most remarkable he reached that scholastic pinnacle through a self-imposed program of persistent education. In getting the "third degree," Colonel Bracha capped a program begun in 1942 when he entered pilot training on the heel of just two years of high school education.

Climbing steadily, he has not only earned a high school diploma but has polished a BS and an MBA in night school and has carried out an impressive array of military assignments, including combat flying in World War II.

Some people sit and rock and dream of objectives. Colonel Bracha says, "But they never take the first step. Once you start toward a goal you just keep going." Persistence becomes a habit.

Bracha met all BSD's material and technical requirements. Colonel Bracha began working on his PhD in 1958, immediately after his assignment to Los Angeles.

In less than four years he completed 80 credit hours of graduate work in business administration, economics, industrial engineering and management. He wrote a lengthy dissertation on "Analysis of Reliability Management in Defense Industries" and on May 14 passed the final comprehensive examination certifying him for the degree.

The 43-year-old officer is quick to admit that his Air Force service has made his extensive education possible.

"We goes to school some three years on a full time basis," he observes. "Without my Air Force background," Colonel Bracha, who maintained high academic standards while pursuing his realistic programs, says it is hard to identify the precise motivation behind his relentless pursuit of knowledge.

"I started out wanting to be a medical doctor," he reflects. "Then I became keenly interested in the sciences. But I feel I have gotten what I wanted. In the opportunity to read and to excel in some field."

"If I had started out with a doctorate in mind," he says, "I probably would have been overwhelmed by the immensity of the task. But the idea is to take first things first, to achieve one objective at a time. I think that's the secret to any long range goal."

Bootstrap Captain One Of 22
In Eglin Advanced R & D Class

by Mike Lucas

Kentucky farmboy to space-age scientist since the close of World War II, that's the real life story of Capt. Kenneth L. Mosby, now at the Proving Ground's experimental research and development school.

The graduate school, unique to the Air Force and operated at Eglin AFB by Florida State University full-time professors, was born three years ago with only physics and mathematics students enrolled. It was an successful that research is now expanding to the Research and Development Installation.

If his recruiter of 17 years ago had suggested that he would earn a master's degree in business administration, Captain Mosby would have been skeptical, amused. The captain, now an electrical engineer with Eglin's 3205th Test Group, has since distinguished himself with one of the 17 civilians with GS-13 ratings and up.

Among his many accomplishments, working with the Armed Services, Mosby has written technical articles plus studies on "Differing Motivations of White Collar Workers" and "Accounting Theory and the Large Corporation."

He points to a magazine article. It covers, "Every year 50,000 technical journals covering the physical and life sciences will be published along with 600,000 research reports."

"No man can read at that pace," Suojanen stresses. He leaves little doubt that this is the Age of the Expert who must depend upon other specialists. The doctor cannot read all medical journals, the fact that technology is vital today, but that quantum management of men, materials, machines and money is even more decisive.

The Air Force estimates it costs $14,000 a year to send a scientist or engineer to a college campus. The Eglin program, run on a seminar basis with outside speakers in addition to Dr. Suojanen, cuts the expense to a mere seventh, or $2,000.

With the summer session recently over, Captain Mosby's class is currently engaged in the task of thesis research and writing. The captain will explore the management aspects of airborne instrumentation. Before next April, the class will have completed some time on the Tallahassee campus for fulfil residency requirements.

Up-East 'Hillbilly'
Adds To His Fame
On Florida Radio-TV

Airman William "Billy" Cole picked up a guitar at age 15 and has been strumming ever since. His rich, deep voice has won him many honors, including eight trophies.

Much of Bill's music is original, and has been praised by professionals. He has performed on stage with a number of professionals, including such notables as Don Gibson, Cruz Wilbur and others.

Although his hometown is in the northeastern part of the US - Batavia, N.Y. - his specialty is country and western style music.

During overseas assignments, "Billy" played most of the clubs in Goose Bay, Labrador and Soundstrom, Greenland.

Now at Patrick AFB, Bill has performed many times at the Cocoa Ser-vice Club. He represented Patrick at the AFSC talent contest held in Patrick AFB, winning first place in the Country-Western category at that show.

Patrick duties didn't permit him to make the trip to Edwards AFB for the AFSC contest.

ECMR Employee Given Top Award
For Work In Scouting Activities

An employee of the Hartford, Conn.
Air Force Contract Management Office
has been given national recognition
for outstanding service to the Boy Scouts
of America.

The highest award any Boy Scout
Council can present to an adult for
distinguished service, the Silver Beaver,
has been presented to Charles B. John-
son, assistant and chief of quality control at
Hartford.

The award was official recognition of
Johnson's long and outstanding career
of dedication to the youth of America.
Over the past 15 years, he has served as
cub master, scoutmaster, neighborhood
commissioner, district commissioner and
district chairman. At present he is
chairman of the Maverick District of
Connecticut, a major of the district
and council training staff and an active
participant on the health and safety
and scout advancement committees.

Johnson spends most of his free time,
including his annual leave, striving to
make better citizens out of the young
people he works with. Each year he
spends two weeks at a waterfront in-
structor at the Girl Scout and Boy Scout
camps, teaching swimming, water safety,
sailing, boating, canoeing and first aid.

Within the greater Hartford area he
runs courses for the American National
Red Cross in water safety, boating
safety and first aid. The crippled and
blind children of the area benefit greatly
from a special 12 weekend training pro-
gram he conducts for them in swimming
and other activities.

One of the highlights of Johnson's
scouting career was the Pioneer Trek
to undivided last summer. He organ-
ized and led a group of 36 scouts and
explorers on a 21-day trip from Hart-
ford to Cimarron, N. M.

Special buses were painted to simu-
late covered wagons. Scouts rode in
each bus and at each base, the Air Force
provided food and lodging.

At the Air Force Academy the scouts
were treated to a realistic presentation
of an aerospace career and the part

three days prior to an actual flight. The
cadets put on a special physical fitness
display and conducted a parade for the
scouts.

At their destination, the Philmont
Scout Range at Cimarron—127,000
acres of rugged country on the slopes
of the great Rocky Mountain Range, the
group put to use knowledge of their
emulated their American pioneer fore-
fathers by living off the wilderness with
their belongings on their backs.

They hiked some 150 miles through
the land of Kit Carson and the Indians
to the great peaks of the Rocky Moun-
tains. As their leader, Johnson's respon-
sibilities were heavy. Yet the whole trip
was completed without a single mishap
of any kind.

Johnson lives in Windsor Locks,
Conn., with his wife, Inez, and their
two children, John, 15, and Mary, 13.
The whole family is interested in out-
door activities and the children are

active scouts.

ASD Man Earns Award
For IFF Systems Work
Robert W. Stanford, of the Directo-
rate of Operational Support Engineer-
ing, Aeronautical Systems Division,
recently received a special act of serv-
ice award of $300. The award was
presented by Col. William Mark Mack
(HQ) Systems Command.

Stanford was one of two representa-
tives for the Air Force at a series of
technical meetings lasting 18 months.
At the conclusion of the meetings,
the "Serfin Fix," developed by Mert
Stern, Rome Air Development Center,
was adopted for use by the United
Kingdom. Critical Saran military and
civil IFF systems were evaluated and
chosen over a number of other inter-
national proposals.

Stanford also has been recommended
for the Federal Civilian Service
Award for his part in obtaining joint
agreement on military characteristics
of the IFF system. He was instrumental
in securing conference members that
would help develop the IFF system
geared into USAF airborne sets.

An electronics engineer in the tele-
communications branch, he started his
career at ASD in 1941 as a chief navi-
gating aide in the Aircraft Radio Lab-
oratory.

Four Commands Cited
For Savings Program
As 'Money Tree' Ends

Four major commands were presented awards on July 12 by Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, USAF Chief of Staff
at a Pentagon ceremony which officially closed Project "Money Tree". Gen. Mark E Bradley was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his part in this program, which resulted in savings of more than $100 million on everyday Air Force maintenance and management operations.

The net savings to the Air Force were cited by Brig. Gen. Thomas D. White, Asst. to the Chief of Staff, Gen. Bradley in November 1960 when he was deputy chief of staff for systems and logistics. The savings were part of a final summation is committed by Air Force fiscal officials.

While the immediate savings were approximately $100 million, officials said the long-range results will be considerably higher with a "potential saving of a half billion dollars."

The "Money Tree" program made the Air Force systems and logistics efficiency and readiness more effective by eliminating duplication, increase work efficiency and reduce the cost of maintaining the highly diversified Air Force operation. While it preceded by several months a similar project put into effect by the Department of Defense, it followed the principles of the DOD economy and good management program. Concurrently, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara recently reported to the President that the DOD program resulted in substantial savings in all areas of Defense operation.

Aerial counterinsurgency, the tough training program underway at Hurlburt Field, Fla., for the Air Force's 4900th Training Squadron, will be used to train highly trained commandos of allied nations in the free world.

The mission of the Air Force's commandos is not to engage actively in conflict but to instruct allied air crews in all phases of aerial counterinsurgency missions and tactics, as well as the techniques of aerial counterguerra warfare.

Training in low level troop and supply drops, close air support, interdiction raids and night detection techniques are among the things to be imparted to airmen of allied nations by the USAF air commandos.

Although principles and techniques used by both ground and air commandos are similar, the newly-formed air commandos will be trained to make greater use of air operations.

Upon completion of their training, the Air Force commandos will help train commandos of allied nations to develop units of their own.

SOCIAL SIDE

57 Lady Volunteers Lauded For
Hospital Red Cross Service

Capping and recognition ceremonies for Red Cross volunteers at the USAF Hospital Lackland were recently held in the Twenty-one Gray Ladies and Youth Service program.

Fifty-seven ladies were marking the end of their training period and 36 workers received service awards. Principal speaker for the occasion was Brig. Gen. James W. Humphreys, Jr., hospital commander. The capping ceremony was performed by Lt. Col. Mary T. Giles, chief nurse.

Among those honored were five Red Cross Gray Ladies. They are Mrs. Richard P. Klocko and Mrs. Kerry Klecka, Mrs. Oakley R. Park and Mrs. Carolyn Park, Mrs. Robert J. Wachsmann and Mrs. Elizabeth Woolverton, Mrs. Victor T. Steinhauser and Mrs. Collins Machwitz, Mrs. Thomas E. Todd and Mrs. Patrick Trimble.

Service awards went to Mesdames William H. Beeler, Thurman A. Glasgow, Lois Herron, Sidney H. Luther, Harold Norris, William A. Woodie and Robert J. Wachsmann; Misses Donna J. Evans, Sharon M. McBee, Donna Faulkner, Mary L. Garcia, Ellen M. Gilbert, Rosa M. Gonzales, Haidy Guerrero, Barbara J. Haddock, Anita L. Henderson, Cheryl Kent, Connie Kentner, Kerry Klocko, Stacy Klutz, Rosemary Ledgerwood, Peggy A. Mooney, Donna L. Menefee, Stephanie Monk, Barbara J. Nichols, Cynthia L.

VA Child Benefit
Facts Available

The Veterans Administration has put out a reminder for your reference on the legal definition of "orphan" and what it can mean in college educational benefits to your children.

The VA says that there are five major areas of misunderstandings which keep eligible children from applying for benefits rightfully theirs.

For the benefit, an "orphan" is a child whose natural parent has died as the result of a wound, accident or illness, attributable to service.

The VA says that the dead parent had to have been in service at the time of death or the death was the result of a service-connected disability.

Patrick Wives Club
Gives 4 Scholarships

Four students recently received scholarships totaling $1,150 from the Patrick AFB Officers Wives Club. Marlies Dunlap, daughter of Msgt. and Mrs. Elwyn B. Dunlap, received a $300 scholarship to SFC Robert M. Rhodes, son of Capt. and Mrs. Robert M. Rhodes, and plans to attend Brigham Young University, and plans to apply his $300 grant toward a course in either chemical or aeronautical engineering.

Lorna Butler, son of Msgt. and Mrs. William F. Butler, plans to use his $150 at the University of Florida where he will study civil engineering.

Final selection for the scholarships was made by the superintendent of Brevard County Schools, and a committee of educators.

If the veteran-parent's death resulted from the performance of duty or from extra hazardous service during peacetimes, the child is eligible.

3. The fact that they are married does not affect their eligibility for "children."

Any son or daughter of a serviceman, whose death is attributable to his service, is eligible for the educational benefits provided he or she is between 18 or 23 years of age.

4. The fact that their living parent and other step-father has legally adopted them, makes some children believe they are ineligible.

The marriage of the living parent and the subsequent adoption does not affect the eligibility of the children.

5. Although training for a high school diploma is not permitted, eligible children may take vocational courses and other non-college training that will help them earn a living.

The VA says it will be glad to spell out details of the program. (AFNS)

RECENT UFO SIGHTINGS

More high altitude UFO sightings. It seems that almost every American naval or high altitude coast flight is accompanied by UFO's of one sort or another. On our trip we reported in Capt. John Shean's dispatch, which were also seen by Russian passenger Shchedrin Shcherby. More recently, a pilot filed a report with a coast guard district, case reported five or six disc-shaped or cylindrical-shaped objects. Some were vertical, some horizontal, some history-making flight. Still later, another AID flight, this time by Roger M. Jost, tumbling in 1954.

The XB-52 sightings have been more or less substantiated at base or tracking area in the Unites States. A recent official Air Force report, consisting on the Wilber and Glenn incident, concluded in following: "Technically speaking, the sighting was a natural phenomenon, though several possibilities have been suggested. In any case, rather than attempt to draw any definite conclusions, the report left the matter completely open. The wording here is very significant, pointing possibly to the UFO's very non-threatening, but completely mysterious phenomena of some sort.

SPACE

Glenn Reports on Flight

THE BRILLIANT LIGHT from the "Firebell" Astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. saw peeping the window of his space capsule was observed by more than 1,400 scientists at a symposium in Washington, D.C. Astronaut Glenn, describing his orbit, during flight, clearly revealed reflections of the burning chunks of retro-pack, flying off the space capsule's heat shield.

The astronaut's silvery suit, his face, and features around him in the cabin were clearly visible through the window every time a chunk went past the window. The retropack is generally flung off the heat shield after its braking rockets have been fired. A fairly accurate and shown film of the flight has been made, the astronaut and he was therefore considered not to release the retropack, which might help hold a loose heat-shield extra tight.

However, Astronaut Glenn was not interested in making much of the film's about the burning chunks. Showing of the film, he said that he expected it more advisable to keep the pilot updated "on each bit of information," rather than waiting for a final discussion of the ground-based observations.

The astronaut also showed color slides taken with his 35 millimeter camera while light from the sun.

He had hoped to study an area close to the sun while above the atmosphere, but this would require a period of dark adaptation prior to sunset.

An eye patch had been developed for this purpose. It was to be held in place by a strap around the head during the flight.

The plan had been for the astronaut to use the eye mask patch while still in the daylight and to look with the dark-adapted eye after he passed into the dark zone.

If the eye patch can be made to work out, the next step, the astronaut may get valuable information from the eye just as close to the sun just as it passes below the horizon. It is also possible that one of the future astronauts in the two-man Gemini capsule could use a mask such as a good dark-adapted eye patch, which takes over to minimize the sun's glare.

ASTRONOMY

X-15 for Star Research

THE HIGHLIGHTING research airplane, the X-15, will be used as a platform for studying the stars from above most of the earth's atmosphere.

A new role for the X-15 - base for experiments in aeronautical and space sciences - was announced by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington, D. C. Work on one of the primary projects, an experiment in ultraviolet photography of the stars, has already started.

University of California, Dr. A. D. C. De and T. F. Hoeck plan to test current views pertaining to the origin and nature of stars using the ultraviolet and infrared photo-spectrographic techniques. The high-flying X-15 can climb above 99% of the atmosphere, but light is obscured by atmospheric ozone, but the X-15 can fly above this layer.

One advantage of the X-15 is that the aircraft can be oriented to face the stars. Another is that it can return and repeat the experiment.

Instruments for the "star tracker" include a gimballed platform containing four cameras, to be mounted in the X-15 instrumentation bay behind the cockpit.

The new program for the X-15 is planned to make use of its capabilities for extremely high speed and altitude. Beyond all but a small fraction of the earth's atmosphere, it adds at least 35 flights to the schedule originally for X-15 research and may take two years to complete.

There will be a successor to the X-15. No money has yet been allotted in the budget, but plans for this year include completing the study and design of the plane.

The plane, unnamed so far, is expected to have a combination of the ramjet and turbo-rocket. It will be a non-air-breathing engine that will have some ability to cruise, which the X-15 does not. The plane is expected to be capable of flying higher and faster than the X-15 which once achieved a record height of 217,000 feet and a speed of 4,000 miles an hour.

Joe Walker (Craig, May 30). White is
the most serious flyer in the N.A.s group.
He and his pretty wife Doris live with
their three children in one room, two doors
from the Air Force base at Edwards Air
Force Base. He is a test pilot who flies
where White sits a desk when he
is not jockeying X-15s and jets. They
entertain only infrequently, take off for
the Los Angeles beaches every chance
they get.

New Mystery. After the sky-stabbing
flight May 10 last week, Karl White
—White Walker, North America's Test
Crossfield and Navy Commander Scott
Crossfield—journeyed to Washington
where President Kennedy gave them the
Robert J. Collier Trophy, presented annually since 1911 for outstanding achievements in flight. But for White and his
follow X-15 pilots, the greatest reward
is their work: the satisfaction of solving the mysteries inside the sky. In his
week's flight Bob White found a new way
to fly X-15 tricks: through a new territory for scientists to puzzle over; through
the X-15's thick left (parts unknown, he
saw a strange sight. "There are things not
there." he said dramatically over his
pipe. "Absolutely." A White later described one "method one can't talk
about." But he had been up 65,000 to
50 to 40 feet away. I haven't any idea
what it could be."

Most Serious. White drew the spotlight after X-15 assignment in 1958. When
Captain Iven Kincheloe died in an F-104,
crash the month after White moved up
to top Air Force pilot on the X-15—which
has been a flying test bed for developing
systems used in today's jets. From
1955 until 1956 he trained intensively,
often flew jets on "chase" missions.
Other pilots were testing the X-15. Pilot
rally, in April 1960, he took the X-15 up
for the first time. Within five months he
had flown it to its first world altitude
record (65.5 miles); since then he has
piloted the X-15 to half a dozen new
world altitude marks.

Less Rambunctious Follow Test Pilot

THE PROCESS OF EDUCATION
With President Kennedy already set on
a tax cut this year if he can get it, the
Administration last week moved to clear
some obstacles out of the way—or at least
to chart them carefully for future reference. While deliberately downplaying any
idea that the U.S. might be on the brink

of another recession—a task that becomes
increasingly difficult as more sharply
economic indicators come out—it began
the process of "reducing" the Congress
and the people to the need for a tax cut.
The first lesson: public hearings on whether the tax is desirable now.

The Administration launched Wilbur
Mills, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee and a reluctant tax
cutter at best, to hold the hearings this
week. Since Kennedy was publicly for a
tax cut—and may not until August, after
he has seen the economic figures for July
and August—the Administration officials will appear at
the hearings. Instead, the hearings will
call economic specialists from the C.I.O.,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the Brookings Institution, plus business men who have to meet payrolls and
are presumably more aware of a tax cut's
potential effect than Government economists. One invited witness: Federal Reserve Bank of New York Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr.

Risky Tactic. To find out how Congress
now feels about a reduction, advocates
were busy quizzing Democrats, members
on their attitude toward a quick $5 bil.
lion to $7 billion cut that would include
individual and corporate income
taxes. Their findings: somewhat more than
half of the Senate and House members
such a cut, but only under a variety of
ill-defined conditions. As well as educating the public, the Mills hearings are
intended to overcome such congressional
indecision.

The soundings also revealed a tendency
among some powerful congressional Democrats to oppose a tax cut unless it is accompanied by a reduction in the Government's budget deficit—a deficit that final figures released last week showed $1.6
$6.3 billion for fiscal 1962. That was $700
million less than Administration expects

GENETICS

Space Changes Heredity

• CHANGES IN HEREDITY of organisms can come from space flight. Some scientists reported at the Third International Symposium on Space Biology in Paris. However, the adverse physical effects in men and dogs when exposed to space do not appear to be permanent or pathological in nature.

Both Cosmonauts Gagarin and Titov experienced unusual sensations during weightlessness. Gagarin's flight has been cited to hamper the performance of his duties to space.

Titov, during the transition from active flight to the ground, suffered headaches, dizziness and nausea. This was followed by giddiness and nausea which increased with the head movements.

His appetite suffered and his first sleep was restless. "There are reasons to believe that giddiness, nausea and the decrease of working capacity were the results of the neuro-regulatory mechanism" which appeared under "extra-gravity" (centrifugence) due to the interaction of a number of different systems, the Soviet scientists said.

Titov's discomfort lessened when he limited his head movements. Experiments further showed completely different reactions which accompanied his return to earth.

Soviet Academicians V. V. Parin and O. G. Gazenko reported on the Russian biological space program. On the basis of USSR studies, they urged the necessity for

Explore Solar Flares

• MANMADE radiation on earth has yielded to the development of new tools and techniques for exploring solar radiation with satellites in outer space. Dr. Herbert Friedman of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory said in an interview at the Third International Space Symposium in Washington, D. C.

Experiments at the Lockheed Observatory (OSO), to be launched next year, to measure the temperature and density of gases in nuclear reactors will be used in studying Solar flares. These experiments may yield clues to the flare's origin.

Solar flares are the emission of high energy particles that appear to explode or flare out from the surface of the sun. Scientists want to study their origin, composition and weather. The ability to predict solar flares is essential for the safety of man in future deep space probes, and indeed, is vital to better communication.

They originate, according to present theories, from electrical discharges, or thermal reactions. Heat and density measurements will help explain the flares, although it is possible that the flares are more complex.

Experiments are being planned to map the sun and observe its corona with satellites. Scientists will be able to make more observations of the corona in a day than less previously been possible.

SEISMOLOGY

Mexico Quake Largest Since Disaster in 1957

• THE EARTHQUAKE which shook the southern states in Mexico on May 11 was the worst in that area since 1957 when 68 persons were killed, many injured and considerable damage was caused in Washington, D. C.

The quake struck nearly half way between Mexico City and the famous resort town of Acapulco. The shock resonated around the world for several hours.

Buildings collapsed in Chilpancingo, Iguala, and other towns. Landslides and fissures, light poles and buildings fell in Acapulco and Mexico City. An electric power plant was knocked out in Mexico State and some of Mexico's worst roads were reached by the quake in the Mexico City Federal District.

The quake, centered 7 miles or 12 kilometers from Acapulco, had a 7 magnitude on the Richter scale, compared to a 7.3 reading for the 1957 shock.

This disturbance is quite significant, at a moderate point only, since 1 magnitude is multiple 64 times in intensity.

John Glenn
and His Day of Miracles
Condensed from TIME

THIS WAS the moment. He had worked toward it for three years. Now he was alone, flat on his back on a form-fit couch in side the instrument-packed capsule Friendship 7. In an incredibly mat- ter-of-fact voice, Lt. Col. John Her- schel Glenn, Jr., began to count: "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six . . ."

A great yellow-white gout of flame spewed out from the Atlas-D missile. For nearly four seconds, it seared rooted to its pad. Then, at-

1962 JOHN GLENN AND HIS DAY OF MIRACLES 65

like all of you who worked on it to
feel that I am your representative.
I'm getting the attention for all
the thousands of you who worked
on it."

In terms of national prestige,
Glenn's flight put the United States
back into the space race with a
vengeance, and gave the morale of
the entire free world a huge and
badly needed boost. Contrasted with
earlier Russian shots, it was a great
victory for the open society. This
produced Glenn—and proved the
wisdom, in terms that Woodrow
Wilson might have used, of "open
skies openly viewed."

Technically, it justified and redeemed the long, labors, careful
planning and exacting standards of
the U.S. space program, into which
the nation has hopefully poured
several billion dollars.

For man himself, it produced
some valuable lessons. Because the
Russians released little data about
astronauts Gagarin and Titov, the
world now knew with certainty
for the first time that, at least for
the period Glenn spent in space, a
healthy and well-conditioned man
can face the forces of gravity and
weightlessness with no ill effects. By
taking over the controls himself and
proving that man can "fly" a capsule
through space, Glenn also struck a
blow for man's genius and versatility, answering the critics who

claim that instruments can do anything better in space than man. Said
Glenn, "Now we can get rid of some
of that automatic equipment and
let man take over."

The Enormity of Space. For the
United States Glenn's flight is only
the beginning. After at least four
more three-orbit flights, U.S. space
officials plan to send an astronaut
on an 18-orbit shot sometime late
this year or early in 1963. With more
powerful rockets, under development, the United States hopes to
launch two-man capsules by 1964,
keep them in orbit for as long as
two weeks. (U.S. scientists estimate
that the Soviet Union may try a two-
man orbital flight almost any day.)
Most ambitious of foreseeable U.S.
space flights is Project Apollo, which
aims at putting three men on the
moon—and bringing them back by 1968.

At his first press conference, John
Glenn emphasized the point that the
exploration of space is still in its
primitive stages. If the diameter of
the earth were scaled down to about
80 inches, he said, his flight had
brought us only 1 1/3 inches above
it. "If you think of the enormity of
space, it makes our efforts seem
puny. But these are all step-by-step functions we go through. The
manned flights we've had to date
have added information. This flight,
I hope, added a bit more."

Race Discrimination
With a Union Label

While union constitutions boast of brotherhood, hundreds of local councils Negroes to the lowest jobs and, in many cases, exclude them from work entirely

By Lester Velie

On the battle ground on which the Negro fights for equality, the unions, which control his daily bread, limit him more.

Union constitutions exclude Negroes. Union lobbying battle for civil-rights laws, but most unions in the building trades—the electricians, plumbers, sheet metal workers and others—exclude Negroes. So do the printers and engravers, and many locals of the machinists.

This means exclusion from a job. For although the Taft-Hartley Act outlaws the closed union shop, under which a man must show a union card before he can work, it is the unions that control the hiring in these trades. The contractor who needs bricklayers or electricians calls the union hiring hall for them.

In Washington, D.C., Negro families can now send their children to integrated schools, eat at any public restaurant or put up at any hotel. But no Negro has yet gained admittance to the plumbers local there, or to the electricians, steamfitters, sheet metal workers, stone cutters or a dozen others.

For two years after Negro electrician James Holland came from Detroit to Washington, he was unable to get a construction job; the all-white Washington Electricians

Clue to "Glenn Effect" In Astronaut's Pocket

THE CLUE to the identity of the luminous particles observed by Astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. may be in the pocket of the next orbiting astronaut.

A scientific mystery of what happens in space should solve the mystery of the "light spots" known as the Glenn effect, are, Dr. Charles M. Herzfeld of the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency said in Science 136:1021, 1962. Dr. Herzfeld believes that the color of these spots, their luminosity and the period of visibility indicate that they are condensed nitrogen and possibly oxygen irradiated by the sun.

Other scientists have theorized that the spots may be a film of ice from the capsule. The yellowish green color of the particles rules against the ice theory.

Dr. Herzfeld told Science Service: "Let when flying over the sun side," he said, "luminous nitrogen is light yellow-green. He gives no support to the pure film hypothesis.

The ARPA research scientist believes that a nitrogen and oxygen released by the capsule became luminous when the rays of the rising sun hit them. (Glenn had observed the particles after each sunrise on his orbital flight.)

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is seriously considering Dr. Herzfeld's suggestion that a spectroscope in the equipment of the next astronaut would show whether the luminosity lies in the spectrum for nitrogen and oxygen atoms.

SEATTLE (AP)--TEST PILOT JOE WALKER SAYS FILM TAKEN DURING HIS RECENT FLIGHT IN THE ROCKET-POWERED X-15 EXPERIMENTAL PLANE TO A RECORD HEIGHT OF 65.5 MILES SHOWS SOME UNEXPLAINED OBJECTS.

IT WAS THE THIRD REPORT OF UNEXPLAINED OBJECTS AT HIGH ALTITUDES.

WALKER, AS NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS TEST PILOT, REPORTED SIGHTING STRANGE OBJECTS DURING ORBITAL FLIGHTS AROUND THE EARTH.

TALKING TO A PANEL OF NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PEACEFUL USES OF SPACE, WALKER DISCUSSED EXPERIMENTAL FLIGHTS. GLENN ALSO WAS ON THE PANEL.

WALKER SAID THE FILM WAS FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE FUSELAGE OF THE X-15 AND POINTED TOWARD HIS REAR. HE SAID THE OBJECTS APPEARED AS THE PLANE ROSE TO A HEIGHT OF 65.5 MILES. HE ADDED, "I DON'T FEEL LIKE SPECULATING ABOUT THE NATURE OF THESE OBJECTS."

WALKER, WHO REPORTED SEEING FIRST-LIKE OBJECTS DURING HIS THREE ORBITAL FLIGHTS, SAID THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF CONDENSED CRYSTALS OF WATER VAPOR FROM HIS CAPSULE -- SNOWFLAKES.

"I DON'T FEEL THEY ORIGINATED FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULE," HE SAID. "I DON'T FEEL THEY ORIGINATED FROM THE CAPSULE AT ALL, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY MOVED."

HE SAID THE OBJECTS WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FIREFLY AND ABOUT THE SAME COLOR. THEN, ABOUT 3 TO 10 FEET APART, TRAVELING SOME THREE TO FIVE MILES AN HOUR RATHER FASTER THAN THE CAPSULE.
