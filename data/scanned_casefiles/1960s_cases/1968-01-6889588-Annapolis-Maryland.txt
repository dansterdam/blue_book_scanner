Object just appeared in the sky moved along like a plane and disappeared out over the bay. I did not come up from the ground, it just suddenly appeared moved right along, disappeared out onto the bay, then another appeared at the same spot and continued on out over the bay. Reflection was white or silver, shaped as below:

Phenomenon was at one height and moved along like plane, only more frequently, one after another and disappeared over the bay out of sight.

When first noticed we thought they were rockets being discharged from Nike Sight which is about a mile from residence, but on second thought could not comprehend rockets being shot out of the bay.

13. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
Had just returned home with grandchildren, built a fire in the fireplace, children requested we turn off lights, which we did, it was then that the children noticed the things in the sky. At first we thought they were planes, but then it became apparent they were too frequent and went in one direction.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Went out over the bay. As soon as it disappeared, another appeared, and continued in the same path.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                5 Feb 63

UFO OBSERVATION: 24 January 1963

Mrs. [redacted] of [redacted], Annapolis, Md 21401
on 8 Feb 63,
called to inform us of her UFO observation. She didn't think too much
of it until there were items about it in the newspaper.

The objects were flying about the same rate of speed as that of an
airplane, about five minutes. One of the captains on a steamer
on the bay noticed it over the bower's helm of the ship and radioed
into shore. Saw them at about 930 pm flying across the bay, one
after the other, they weren't airplanes. There a NIKE site nearby
and until we found out that there were hundreds of reports by the
Bay Police we began to wonder. The objects didn't come from the
earth, they went out over the bay, about every three minutes and
disappeared, white round, flew at one level and just saw them and they
disappeared.
