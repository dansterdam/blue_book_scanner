1. PROJECT LOG RECORD
2. LOCATION: Annapolis, Maryland
3. CONCLUSION: Probable Object (Reflection of SearchLight)
4. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer sighted numerous white or silver fuzzy elongated lights, appearing to be a plane and disappearing over the bay. Then another light was observed under the lights and disappeared soon after. The Annapolis Police Dept. received no reports of unusual sightings on this night. A cold front with rain and snow showers was moving just off the coast, and the unusual lights were probably reflections from searchlights on the clouds.

The text in the document is as follows:

10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE RELATED.
One after the other, that is when we decided it was not airplanes, as there were too many and too frequent.

Object just appeared in the sky moved along like a plane and disappeared out over the bay. It did not come up from the ground. It just suddenly appeared, moved right along, disappeared out onto the bay, then another appeared at the same spot and continued on out over the bay. Reflection was white or silver, shaped as below:

CAPT/Lt Col Smith
Request information on the amount of cloud cover, height and type of clouds over Annapolis, Maryland for 21 January 1968. Anytime between 2030 and 2200 hours would be fine.

We are interested in seeing if there are cirrus clouds that might have reflected a ground searchlight. Your comments on this occurring would be appreciated.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
UFO OBSERVATION: 2 January 1968
Mrs. [redacted], Annapolis, Md 21401
called/to inform us of her UFO observation. She didn't think too much
of it until there were items about the observation in the newspaper.
The objects were flying about the same rate of speed as that of an
airplane, about five minutes. One of the captains on a steamer
on the bay noticed it over the bow's her lm of the ship and radioed
into shore. Saw them at about 930 pm flying across the bay, one
after the other, they weren't airplanes. There a NICE site nearby
and until we found out that there were hundreds of reports by the
Bay Police we began to wonder. The objects didn't come from the
earth, they went out over the bay, about every three minutes and
disappeared, while round, flew at one level and just saw them and they
disappeared.
