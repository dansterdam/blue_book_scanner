9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Obj size of baseball, reportedly constantly, apparently disappearing during maneuvers. Obj appeared in 2600' approx. proceeding in NE track, turning to E, proceeding SW along same track as inbound sighting. Initially appeared in horizon, and was under visual observation until it disappeared over horizon.

10. COMMENTS: Witness sighted what they thought left by a/c. There were 2 B-52's in area at time and with a flight path closely paralleling that of reported obj. Witnesses probably saw 1 of these a/c and incidentally heavy contrails could have been caused by layers of air of slightly different temperatures. It is therefore concluded that obj reported was probably 1 of a/c in area.
