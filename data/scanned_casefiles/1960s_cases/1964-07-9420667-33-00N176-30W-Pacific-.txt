Text from the document:

THE FLEMINGTON, NEW JERSEY LANDING: ABOUT JULY 14, 1954, A. NEWSPAPERMAN FROM FLEMINGTON, N.J. REPORTED A STRANGE OBJECT WHICH HE SIGHTED IN THE SKY OVER HIS COMMUNITY. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, SILVER IN COLOR, AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRPLANE WING. IT HOVERED BRIEFLY OVER THE TOWN AND THEN SHOT AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW ALMOST INSTANTLY. HIS ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT WAS PUBLISHED IN A LOCAL NEWSPAPER. HOWEVER, DESPITE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN A CLIPPING OF THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE, NO COPY COULD BE LOCATED, EITHER IN THE NEWSPAPER FILES OR IN THE POSSESSION OF THE WITNESS.

Saturn Shines in South
The planet Saturn, visible all night in the southeast, and the brilliant star Vega, in the northwest, brighten the summer evening skies.
By James Stokely
TO CONTINUE FOR MORE ON THE
ASTRONOMY OBSERVATION BY JAMES 
STOKELY:
"SATURN SHINES IN SOUTH"

The text describes the visibility of the planet Saturn and the star Vega in the evening sky during the summer. It provides details about their positions in the night sky and the brightness of Saturn.

The two maps or charts show the positions of celestial objects, likely related to the observations described in the text. One chart appears to depict a broader view of the night sky, while the other is a more detailed view of a specific region.

There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, containing textual information.

FIELDS

C3-F PAINS CAUSED BY GENERAL INFECTIONS

Observations of the fields of force have been made and as a result the field patterns ot' the human body have been analyzed and charted, These fields appear to be disturbed in certain diseases and infections. During general infections, there appears to be a decrease in the intensity of the fields, particularly over the infected regions. This decrease seems to be proportional to the severity of the infection, and when the infection is cleared up, the field returns to normal.

BIRTH CONTROL CHEAPEST
It appears that birth control can be cheapest of all controls. The annual birth rate of 20 in the United States costs the government about $6,000,000,000 annually! A very large percentage of this cost could be saved if all births were controlled and planned.

WEATHER COMPUTER FEES
FOR NON-PROFIT USE

WITH THE RAPID development of weather information and its increasing importance, especially to the shipping industries, the Weather Bureau has been forced to establish a new schedule of fees for weather data and forecasts supplied commercially. However, non-profit organizations such as educational institutions, libraries, and other non- commercial groups will still be able to obtain this data and service without cost.

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a page from an old document, specifically a celestial timetable for August. The text in the document contains a schedule of celestial events and activities for the month of August.

PUBLIC HEALTH
SUMMER CAMPS AND FLIES 
carried from Houses

Fly-breeding and feeding places must receive careful attention and the risk for food contamination during the summer months.

Careless disposal of garbage and refuse, uncovered garbage cans, and human excreta may provide breeding and feeding places for flies, which may carry the organisms of many diseases. 

While houses other than those where fly-breeding is directly under control may be sources of flies, the conditions of houses on the site itself should be carefully inspected and improved to the fullest extent possible. All garbage and refuse should be disposed of in a sanitary manner, and every effort made to eliminate breeding and feeding places for flies.

Fly control should be undertaken as a public health measure in the interest of the health and comfort of both campers and staff. Flies are a serious health menace and should be controlled by careful sanitation, screening, and other means available. Efficient fly control will prevent the transmission of intestinal diseases, dysentery, diarrhea and even typhoid.
