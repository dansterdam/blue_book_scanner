Flemington, New Jersey

Hd. a newspaper article from Flemington, New Jersey, dated July 30th, tells of a local man on a farm in a field near his home. Jack Hall was driving his home one night, he saw a strange glow, high up in the sky. Shortly afterwards the object began in the middle of a 1-acre field. Mr. Hall walked toward the object, it started moving toward him, causing him to panic and run. About 300 feet from the object, he described the thing as white, egg-shaped, and at least 30 feet in circumference.

THE FLEMINGTON, NEW JERSEY LANDING: About July 30th, a resident of Flemington, W. J. named Jack Hall approached Chase, while driving home late one night. He saw a UFO land in the middle of a rural field. Hall parked his car in his driveway, nearby, and walked toward the object. When he got to within about 500 feet of it, the UFO started to move toward him, at which point Hall retreated and ran. He described the thing as white, egg-shaped, and at least 30 feet in circumference. It had a glow coming from underneath it, and this light was seen by Hall's wife and daughter who were inside his house. States Jack Hall, but a tour of the neighborhood turned up nothing unusual.

ASTRONOMY

Saturn Shines in South
The planet Saturn, visible all night in the southeast, and the brilliant star Vega, directly overhead, brighten the summer evening skies.

By JAMES STICKLEY

FOR THE PAST 10 days since last week, the giant planet Saturn, now on view in the evening sky, has been a first-magnitude star and visible all night. On Aug. 15, it will be directly opposite the sun. Its distance from earth will then be 813 million miles.

Coming into view in the southwest, in the constellation of Aquarius, the water carrier, is also on the accompanying map. Here, expect the sky as it looks about 11:00 p.m. some clear night in late August. The star map shows two characteristic constellations of the summer sky: Sagittarius, the archer, and Scorpius, the scorpion.

Vega Directly Overhead

Directly overhead since the brightest star in the summer evening sky is Vega, the lyra. Just below, low in the east, is Cygnus, the swan, with Deneb, the brightest star on its northern and partly on the southern sky map. High in the southwest—about half way from Vega to Saturn—is another bright star, Altair, the eagle in it is the bright star.

All these stars rank as first magnitude and are approximately similar in brilliance. And once more of similar brilliance shine in the west. This is Antares, a bronze, the brilliant star. A good way to find this star is first to locate the big dipper. In the northwest corner of the star map, the big dipper's rotation guides you to Saturn, the gold star.

Following the curve of the big handle of the dipper brings us to Arcturus, a yellowish star.

Coming into view in the east is a well-known summer constellation, Pegasus, the winged horse. Although not a constellation, the "Great Square" is a striking star figure. The star called Alpheratz which marks one of the corners, is actually, in the western part of the constellation Andromeda. These three stars form a famous pattern for Pegasus and Cassiopeia were the king and queen of an ancient Ethiopian, and Andromeda was their daughter.

By mid-August the planet is about 12 times brighter than a first magnitude star. Saturn now traces its orbit in Gemini.

Generally a meteor first appears about 50 miles above the ground, and often shows about 30 miles. The length of the streak path may be a much as several hundred miles, depending on the angle at which the meteor enters the atmosphere. The meteor's speed is about 30 miles per second, but varies above and below depending on whether it meets the earth head-on, or has to catch up with it.

Romoan Meteors Visible

On any dark night, if you watch long enough, you will see a few random meteors like at certain times of the year, particularly about Aug. 12, you may see many meteors perhaps one every minute or two. Then if there are no clouds, look head-on, sweeping up all the sky. In a few evenings only, those meteors moving fast enough to catch up will be seen.

A meteor is commonly called a "shooting star," but it is actually a small bit of rock, moving through space at high speed. When one enters the earth's atmosphere, encounters may vary air molecules, which are relatively numerous even at such high altitudes. These encounters cause the meteor until it evaporates. Then the eye-perceived atoms collide with more atoms which give off light. These form the visible meteor trail, which briefly arcs the sky and that has a distinctive touch longer than the original solid meteor particle.

FIELDS

Cleft Palate Caused by
Prenatal Injections

FINDINGS of a series of tests on substances in pregnant mice have provided clues pointing to a possible cause of cleft palate, University of Michigan researchers reported.

Environmental stress, in the form of a deficiency diet, malnutrition, or a deficient diet and water, together with a particular hormonal offering in experimental animals, may be a causative factor in the development of cleft palate, which arises one out of 800 births. The study was conducted with Dr. Peter Gruen, both of the School of Dentistry, and Dr. Alexander Barry, professor of anatomy.

MILITARY SCIENCE

U. S. Cotton Spray
Goes to Vietnam

THE SAME CHEMICAL sprays used by foresters in this country for defoliating forests from boiling coquihaling machinery are now being used in Vietnam. This is the first time that defoliation by spraying has been used by the United States Army in Vietnam, and it is merely one of the latest applications of chemical warfare during World War II.

MEDICINE

Birth Control Cheapest
With New Plastic Coils

CHICAGO (AP) - A new, cheap, long-lasting method of birth control using a nickel-provide the greatest hope for birth control in underdeveloped countries, a graduating class of physicians was told.

In the next 10 years, Dr. Aaron Rovinsky, responsible for much of the development of this method in the world, Dr. Nicholson Eastman, Ford Foundation, and others believe this method of birth control will almost double the population.

Although contraceptive pills have been successful in economically developed countries, they are too expensive for use in underdeveloped areas. The new method is a plastic coil, a method that will give practically nothing to the user and will remain in the uterus for up to five years.

TECHNOLOGY

Weather Computer Free
For Non-Profit Use

WEATHERNET - who have a research problem that would like to use a computer to solve it - can now get computer time free or at cost.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colo, is freeing some computer time for non-profit organizations. Problems in such diverse fields as radioastronomy, meteorology, oceanography, and the transfer of heat by radiation can be handled by the computer.

GENERAL SCIENCE

Measles Vaccine Too New
Health Officials Say

AT THE NICEST PRODUCT meeting of the American Medical Association here, medical experts said that no public health officials yet feel that the public should get mass vaccination of the new measles vaccine.

There was an epidemic of German measles in the country which at most "perhaps 5 percent" of the population contracted. There is not yet a vaccine available for it.

AERONAUTICS

Plane Flies 35 MPH,
Takes Off in 75 Feet

A NEW "channelwing" airplane can take off vertically at speeds as low as 35 miles per hour.

The plane, designed by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Hagerstown, Md., has two conventional wing tips on the possible lift. Instead, the two engines are suspended in "channels" in the wing, with the propellers pointing downward.

By drawing air through the channels, vertical lift is possible at speeds much lower than in a conventional plane.

Here is the text from the document:

a railroad, these seem to converge in the distance; this happens in August to be in the direction of the stars of Perseus.

To see the Perseids at their best, you need a dark sky, preferably away from the glare of city lights.

It happens to be a few days past the full phase, it will be shining brightly in the sky when you want to see the meteors. Its share will be out all but the brightest.

But this year the moon is new on Aug. 7, so on the 11th it will still be a crescent.

So take advantage of this opportunity if you can in the night of the 10th, or even later.

It takes several days for the earth to go through the shower.

PUBLIC HEALTH

Summer Ants, Flies
Evicted from Houses

> TIGHTEN THE LID of your garbage
can and do not let food sit out during the
summer months.
This removes breeding and feeding
grounds of the obnoxious house fly, one
of the most pestiferous insects, according
specialists in the new bulletin, "Controlling
Household Pests," recently published by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.

To keep the mosquito population down,
drain or fill any standing water areas so
that any uncovered water is not standing
around the home or garden in ditches,
pails, buckets or other containers. Stagnant
water is the home for the young mosquito
larvae.

You might also look for the wiggling
mosquito larvae in the water in flower
vases, U.S. entomologists suggest. Look for
them also in water that collects in saucers
under potted plants. Even some inch bowls
and aquariums may have the baby mosquitoes swimming around. Drain or destroy
the wigglers.

The new folders point out that it is easier
to keep pests out than to get them out. The
best preventive is good housekeeping.
This means proper care of garbage, careful
of food, clothing and other household
articles susceptible to insect damage.

The bodies discusses habits and control
of common household pests such as ants,
termites, rats, mice, centipedes and even
bats.
