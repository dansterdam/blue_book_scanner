Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear sirs,
Queen June 23, 1960

Chicago 1963, 020

Dear Sir:
I would like to report a sighting of an unidentified flying object which I observed on the evening of June 23, 1960. While driving from Fairfield, Illinois to my home, I noticed a peculiar light in the sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched it, I realized it was not an ordinary aircraft. The light was moving in a very erratic manner, making sharp turns and changing direction rapidly. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. 

Between this peculiar light and another light about 1/2 mile away, there seemed to be some kind of connection or relationship. The two lights would move together, one appearing to follow the other. At times, the lights would join together and then separate again.

I watched this display for about 15 minutes before the lights disappeared from view. It was a clear, moonlit night and the lights were easily visible against the dark sky. I have no explanation for what I saw, and I would very much appreciate any information you could provide about this sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"It appeared to be a large disc over the barn, It was moved 3 flashing lights on the bottom 2 were pulsating real fast - the other was a steady beacon. It hovered over the area about 10-15 minutes. I watched it through binoculars as long as I could see it. The object seemed to come closer to the ground, got larger and then shot up out of sight real fast. It then came back and hovered again over the same area. I checked to see if there was any aircraft in the area and later called the U.S.O. and reported this sighting. Certainly from everyone. The paper said that the U.S.O. and reported this had already called the F.A.A. 

I looked at it later with my relatives and can swear on a stack of bibles this was not terrestrial aircraft. It was discoidal in shape with flashing lights and moved with no apparent sound. It was larger than the middle and seemed to glow as though lighted from within. It was certainly a mystery to me and I am convinced that what we saw was not of this world."

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten letter or document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

"My car friend and I saw the same thing he described at about the same time as he related seeing it. We saw the bright light in the sky and it seemed to engage the same time as the time he related seeing it. I watched the light go into the clouds and then disappear before it came out again for a short time and then disappear again. It had the same characteristics as he described.

I have been very much impressed by the U.F.O. taken from the area and seen in conclusions from the time. He wished to remain anonymous and more could possibly be learned.

Thank you,"

October 21, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in response to your recent letter in which you report seeing an unusual light in the skies over Fairfield, Illinois on August 10th.

The sighting which took place at Fairfield was definitely established as two objects, light emanating from the ground to the sky, such as searchlights or the beams of powerful spotlights. These beams of light were observed lifting off from the ground and ascending into the skies, stopping, and then descending to the ground, repeating this action over and over. Some witnesses reported observing more than one set of these light beams performing this maneuver.

It is impossible to give you the exact route followed by the Air Force investigators during their investigation of the incident, but they have reported that the sighting was not considered by them to be an unusual occurrence, and these phenomena are often quite easily explainable.

It is noteworthy to give you the exact route followed by the Air Force investigators during their investigation of the incident, but they have reported that the sighting was not considered by them to be an unusual occurrence, and these phenomena are often quite easily explainable. 

Since there are only a minute percentage of cases which have remained unsolved, and these only because the information given to the investigators was too sparse, it may be assumed that your sighting had a logical explanation, such as BOZO statistics plus a searchlight.

To date there has been no evidence submitted
to our office by the Air Force indicating
significant scientific developments beyond the
range of our present day knowledge in the
principles known to this office. The vague way in
which officials describe these sightings indicates
that many of these unidentified aerial objects
were extraterrestrial vehicles under intelligent
control.
