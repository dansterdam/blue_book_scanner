Charge 006.13, JEC

Sir:

I am seventeen and I live in north Chicago. I traveled to Fairfield Illinois last August tenth. I read of a U.F.O. and I saw one. I turned such muscle. A boy friend was with me and he saw it also. We parked on a hill one mile north of Fairfield and we could see, just that you.

Between the hour of nine thirty and ten thirty we saw a flash of light darting from side and traveling to the south. It held a stream of white light behind it and slowly disappeared. It stopped clear and then I lost it. I looked into the same direction and I darted across again and stopped clear. For the third time I saw it plank across the sky like a white ship, and then it stopped clear.

Here is the text from the document:

I watched it for an hour, it did
not move. I kindled up with
the stars and it stayed on one
set position. I looked thru a
shifty powered telescope and
saw three colors on it. The front
was pointed and red. The middle
way larger and it was white.
The end was as large as the mid-
dle and it was blue.
While they was moving through
the sky, lights, from the east on
earth were flashing back and
forth into the sky. Claimed as
if it was signaling the U.F.O.
At the same time I heard dogs
barking from everywhere. The
people said that the U.F.O. on
Jupiter made them bark. But they
went together.
I looked at it late with my
naked eye and saw a smaller
dim light pass this other object.
It blinked on and off completely
and then at disappeared

My boy friend and I saw the same thing that night and two persons cannot imagine the same thing at the same time.

I would like to have you write out starkly your investigators route.

I have seen foots of the U.F.O. taken from the paper and seen conclusions from the party. If you wish to learn of this seven, send me a letter and I will write them and more as soon as possible.

Thank you

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in response to your recent letter in which you report seeing an unusual light in the skies over Fairfield, Illinois on August 10th.

The earlier sighting which took place at Fairfield was definitely established as two objects. First the moon, and then the planet Jupiter. Your sighting is very characteristic of a large beam of light emanating from the ground to the sky, such as a searchlight or kilies light. Such a beam, when shifting from a distance, gives the appearance of darting around the sky, stopping, then retracing its long sweep, then stopping again with no apparent pattern except that chosen by the person or persons who control the light at its source. Due to refraction, this light or lights may give the appearance of changing color. Atmospheric conditions also give strange appearances to otherwise easily explainable phenomena.

It is impossible to give you the exact route followed by the Air Force Investigators during their investigation of the original Fairfield sighting. They traversed the original route reported by the young man whose first saw what was considered an unidentified flying object, but they also went over the entire area, so that it would be difficult to report any constant route which might have been taken.

Since there are only a minute percentage of cases which have remained unsolved, and these only because the information given to the investigators was too meager to provide enough evidence for investigation, it may be assumed that your sighting had a logical explanation. You may have seen more than one object, such as Echo satellite plus a searchlight.


- page 8 -

To date there has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that unidentified sightings or perpetual technological developments or principles beyond the range of our present day scientific knowledge. There has been nothing in the way of evidence or other data to indicate that these unidentified sightings were extraterrestrial vehicles under intelligent control.

Sincerely,
