10. CONCLUSION: Balloon (possible)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers noted while object with black marking or spots on lower half. At first object appeared to be an open parachute at quite a high distance, but with the naked eye no strange attachment. Through binoculars it reminded me of two open parachutes fastened together, with black spots on lower half.

Description is consistent with a balloon.

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 3-4
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Westward

8. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes ☒ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes ☒ No

10. CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT
Base Operations confirmed that three helicopters departed W-P AFB at 2153 EST. These choppers were on their way to Texas, thus accounting for their westward flight path. The choppers could have been the objects observed.

11. IN BRIEF SUMMARY: Four objects were observed traveling over the Dayton area ~2200.
When the observers first saw the objects they were stationary, then they moved and stopped and started again in a westerly direction. The objects were in front of some clouds during part of their flight. The colors of the objects were compared to red traffic lights.

Dear [redacted]

Reference your unidentified observation of 24 August 1966 of several unidentified flying objects over the Dayton area. Contact was made with Base operations regarding your observation. We were informed that three helicopters landed at Wright-Patterson AFB to refuel at approximately 2030 on 24 August. At 2153 these helicopters departed the base with a final destination of Texas. These helicopters would have been over your area at 2200 hours and heading westward.

According to the description you provided, it is felt that you observed these craft departing Dayton.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

craft of lights were of the explain nature they would have had to been something which could travel, stand still, move slightly up and down, and travel on again.

Contact was made with the FAA at WP AFB, Ohio (70042). They only have records of aircraft that have filed an IFR record. There was a Lockheed Electra that took departed the Dayton Cox Airport at 2158. This aircraft would have proceeded toward the north. There were no aircraft flying in formation that the FAA knew of at the time of the sighting.

3 helicopters landed at WP to refuel. They took off at 2153, departing to the west with a final destination of 7 seas. These are would have been reported over the Dayton area at 2200 and heading westward. The description of the objects reported is consistent with that of a helicopter with its lights on.
