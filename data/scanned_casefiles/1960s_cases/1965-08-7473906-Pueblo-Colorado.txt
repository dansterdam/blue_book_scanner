GENERAL DIRECTION. THIS ELIMINATES POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTS
COMING FROM THAT SOURCE. WIND ATA NOT AVAILABLE FROM
PUEBLO HOWEVER PATTERN IN GENERAL SHOULD AGREE WITH
THAT OF COLORADO SPRINGS. THE WINDS AT COLORADO SPRINGS
PAGE 5 RUMFVFA0299 UNCLAS
DO NOT SHIFT AROUND TO A DIRECTION THAT WOULD CAUSE A
PIBAL TO DELIFT SOUTHWEST UNTIL 20000 FEET, HOWEVER THIS
DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH POSITION AND ESTIMATED ALTITUDE
AND SPEED OF REPORTED OBJECT. COLORADO SPRINGS GENERAL
AREA HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL VERY CLEAR NIGHTS RECENTLY
DURING WHICH STARS WERE UNUSUALLY BRIGHT. IT IS POSSIBLE
OBJECT SIGHTED WAS A STAR, AS DIRECTION AND RATE OF
MOVEMENT WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THIS. HOWEVER INFORMATION
AVAILABLE TOO MEAGER TO ARRIVE AT A FIRM CONCLUSION.
