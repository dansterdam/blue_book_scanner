Centre Nurses Report
Strange Lights In Sky
Seven St. Clair County Medical Center nurses reported seeing strange flashing lights in the sky early this morning, according to those reported by deputy sheriffs Nov. 12.

THEY SAID the lights appeared to be high in the air about town miles of their base, and in color, green, red and white in color, in the same as those reported north of Port Huron last month.

The object was first sighted by two of the nurses, Miss Carol Koltz and Miss Judith Bailey, who saw the lights as they drove on M-21.

They returned to the Centre Medical Point Hospital and told other nurses, Mrs. Ballentine, Miss Helen Hicks, Miss Alice Himmelmann, Mrs. Rosemary Ruck and Mrs. Dorothy Hicks. All seven told deputies they saw the object which was a white, red and green flashing light.

After driving about two miles, they stopped, turned off the motor, and shined the car spotlight on the object, which then zoomed out of sight.

One of the nurses said she thought she heard a humming noise like that of a motor, Miss Rosemary Hicks told The Times Herald today.

Deputies Kenneth Kobs and Robert Parker were dispatched to the scene, but by the time they arrived, the lights were gone.

Some believe that the objects sighted may be helicopters, but military installations in the area report no such lights last night.

The non-commissioned officer in charge of base operations during the night at Selfridge Air Force Base said that there were no helicopters from that base in the area last night.

A spokesman from Grosse Ile Naval Air Station said there was no flying activity in the Port Huron area last night from the base.

A Constance Andrei, addressed to Unknown, called the Sheriff Department at about 12:30 a.m. Friday saying an object similar to that seen by the nurses.

In Sky
(Continued from Page One)
Shoulder of the road and sighted
at what they said was "a flick-
ering light in the sky."

They said it seemed to be
hovering over the apple orchard
near Kesswildin.

Baker, with a service behind him,
said he could make out no size
or shape to the object other
than it was a flashing light that
could move in an direction.

He said there was a time that
was a big divided window in the
middle of the flashing light, but
I couldn't be sure." Deputy
Baker said.

He said the object came low
about the height and distance
of a City block.

"As it came, the object
seemed to move out toward the
north east and we attempted
to follow it," Baker said.

THE OFFICER said they reached, peeks up to 75 miles an hour, but the object just ran away from us.

They said they lost sight of the object on Lake Shore Drive, because of Street lights, but when they turned down Metcalf Road and were in the area of Vincent Road they sighted the object again.

This time, the officers turned out the car lights and shined the spotlight of the patrol car on the blinking light in the sky. They seemed much closer to them.

The officers then turned on the flashing light on top of the patrol car and in a few moments they said the object not only had a flashing white light, but it seemed that it was changing a red light back.

Deputy Baker said the object this time seemed to be standing still in the sky and he could hear the sound of motors.

The patrol car was stopped and the ignition off when the officers heard the sound of motors.

It seemed to idle and then a sudden loud noise came louder and more powerful and began to move off into the north west section of the sky, he said.

THE OFFICERS said they watched the mysterious object disappear into the heavens until it was just a speck lost among the stars.

The officers were not sure what first they had seen and heard what they did.

At first they were not going to say anything about what happened, but they decided it would be best to let someone know.

Maybe there was something and maybe there wasn't - a trick of the imagination, or perhaps, but never the less officers Clark and Baker had seen something that they will not soon forget.

16 Nov 63
Port Huron, Michigan

CLOSE SAUCER SIGHTING IN MICHIGAN: Two deputy sheriffs in Port Huron, Michigan, had an unusual encounter with a UFO at about 5 am. November 12th. They observed what seemed at first only a 'flickering light' hovering in the sky. As it got closer, it seemed at times that there was a big divided cloud of the flashing light, but the officers could not be sure.

The UFO eventually approached to a height of only a few hundred feet above the ground, reaching speeds up to 75 miles per hour. The deputies attempted to follow it, retracing speeds up to 125 miles per hour. In the chase, but most misunderstood their, they lost sight of it completely for a while. It then reappeared and the officers stopped the car, turned on their headlights, and shined spotlights onto the object. They then turned on the flashing light on top of the patrol car, and in a few moments the UFO not only had a flashing red light back at them, as if in an attempt at communication, but the UFO appeared to again be standing still in the sky at that time, and they could hear a low sound of motors. Suddenly the motors grew louder, and the object disappeared rapidly out of sight.

'STRANGE LIGHT' OBSERVED

Deputies See Object In Sky
By JOHN F. BROWN

"People will say we are crazy," Deputy Sheriff Robert Baker and Merle Clark said today when they were asked to explain what they saw early today.

THEY DIDN'T say they saw a flying saucer or any little green men, but they did say they saw something out of the ordinary.

The officers were very matter-of-fact about their experience, for today a person who says he sees or hears something out of the ordinary, especially from a "nut" by his fellow man.

But remember when they thought the World was flat -

Even this Times Herald re- to his companion, "There is something odd."

When shortly before 8 a.m. Deputy Sheriff Jack Foster asked if he had heard about the officers' experience, Baker said, "I've 'seen and heard'."

And when he returned to The Times Herald, he was not great with any bows or boasts about his associates' experience.

The officers were on Twenty-fourth Avenue. The sky was extremely dark. It was about 5:15 a.m. A small white silver strip of the moon, which rose at 3:30 a.m. was above the officers.

Just south of Keewahdin Road, Officer Clark remarked to his companion. "There is something strange for the sound was very high-pitched and one that I had never heard before." Mr. Kemp

The officers pulled over to the Continued on Page 11, Col. 3

3 Others Also
See 'Object'
Three other persons have corroborated the story of the Deputies who o b s e r v e d a strange object in the sky early today.

Robert T. Kemp, 3063 Sylvana Drive, Lakeport, who was on his way to work at St. Clair Community Hospital, said that between 5:15 and 5:20 a.m. he saw something that drew his attention skyward.

There was a flashing white light that moved in the direction of Lake Huron.

"It was very strange for the sound was very high-pitched," Mr. Kemp said.

John E. Jordan, 15, of 4357 Keewahdin Road who was walking out of a barn with his father after feeding some horses about 5:30 a.m. said he and his father also saw the strange light.

The light was flashing and it moved to the north. It was very high in the sky and it sure looked a scary feeling about it, young Jordan said.

Strange Object In Sky
Remains A Mystery

The unidentified flying object observed by two St. Clair County deputies and at least 10 other persons about 5:15 a.m. Tuesday will remain a mystery.

It was theorized Tuesday afternoon that the object could have been a jet or turbine-powered helicopter from Selfridge Air Force Base, Mt. Clemens. All agreed the object was a strange one. Deputy Baker said the object seemed to hover and then became more powerful and disappeared into the heavens.

COL. CALES P. Moberly, commanding officer of Selfridge, ruled out this possibility today.

"We have five helicopters, two jet and three U.S. Army regular helicopters, but at the time in question Tuesday they were on the ground at Selfridge," Col. Moberly said.

Jerome Laesmann, information officer, said there was a slight possibility that the object could have been a craft from another military installation, but it wasn't very likely.

A column of features and
opinions by members of
The Times Herald Staff

Rumors of flying objects and strange noises may be
returned again this week in and around Port Huron!
However, before people start calling the police, The
Times Herald or neighbors, they are advised to blink
their eyes a few times, make sure their glasses and
their first Fighter Wing, Air Defense Command, from
Selfridge Air Force Base, will begin an extensive week-
long night flying program today.

"Night flying is one of the many means of training
base personnel current in all phases of air de-
fense," said Capt. B. Kelly, Commander, First
Fighter Wing.

Through the exercise, new and better ways to plan
air defense of the United States are devised to preclude
any attack upon this country by a hostile air power.

ALL IN A DAY
Nobody Believes In Sky Objects, Do They?
By LOUIS J. DUNN

There are many of us "wise" mortals who believe these stories of flying saucers, sky objects and what have you, but did you ever notice how those are the very stories none of us ever misses when reading the paper?

It was that way here in the Times Herald office even before reporter Jerry Brown's story on the sky lights observed by the two deputies, Bob Baker and Marie Clark, got into the paper last Tuesday.

NONE OF US experts believe it, of course. After all, flying objects with motors and flashing lights? Phooey.

But everybody was

knocking everybody down trying to get a chance to read proofs of the story.

Sure, nobody believes in such things . . . but.

Jerry grabbed a nice needle from history to help put the story across. "Remember when they thought the world was flat?" . . . he wrote.

Although not there at the time, we do recall reading in the history books how they all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he set out to prove that the earth was not flat, but round.

There was just one major difference between Chris and this saucer-from-mother-planets business.

Chris could prove he was right, whereas, for now anyway, man is having one tough time proving or disproving anything about what's growing what vegetables on what planets, if any.

Someday perhaps man will be able to soar out there and provide the answers, but right now we just have to sit here and wonder.

THOSE DEPUTIES, and the other persons who also said they saw lights, are level-headed people. Certainly they saw something. We must remember too that none of them would go beyond what they actually saw in describing the incident to the reporter - they didn't speculate, or deal in guesswork. They just told what they observed. No more, no less.

There are some phenomena resulting from the aurora borealis, that ghostly display of northern lights which has been visible of late. The aurora can take the form of strange arcs, bands, curtains, draperies. Sheets or patches that seem to shimmer and flit across the sky, according to William L. Donn in his book, "Meteorology."

But neither of the deputies tells of such draperies or streamers, or anything like that. What they saw was a strange-acting light. Perhaps it was a reflection, from some light on the ground some distance away. Light reflections have been known to bounce skyward with weird results. It could have been from something like that. Nobody's arguing the point. It couldn't have been. What is so frustrating is that no one wants to get off the negative, and become positive. What was it?

IF THOSE LIGHTS were more-driven space vehicles, one might think of a better place for them to make their first touchdown in the U.S.A. than in beautiful St. Clair County where sites are available for industrial expansion, all bridges are now in good condition, the Flats are winning and 1,364 soon will be opened.

The only suggestion we would make is to choose a time other than 5:15 a.m. (when the deputies saw the light) to make the landing.

DALLAS, Tex. (AP)—Did the nebulous mass with two sec-
ondary sections, whose fantastic energy in-
dicates a source far more pow-
erful than nuclear reaction.

More than 100 of the world's
most distinguished scientists be-
gan pondering that question to-
day in the opening sessions of
a three-day symposium on "The
gravitational collapse and oth-
er relativistic topics."

Radio astronomy developed
from the electronic advances of
World War II made possible by
the discovery of an object JC273

Hovios of Cambridge University
and Prof. William A. Fowler of
the California Institute of Tech-
nology, put forth the theory that
the gigantic radio energy of the
galactic radio sources could be
caused by the shrinking, or
gravitational collapse, of a su-
per-star.

Dr. Hoyle says this theory,
yielding a hundred times more
energy than the most powerful
nuclear reaction — hydrogen to
helium, is "the most exciting
which has attracted the interest
of scientists over the world,"
prompted the Southwest Center
for Advanced Studies to arrange
the three-day symposium. Co-
organizers are the University of
Texas and Keehiva University

Despite its tremendous bright-
ness and energy, object JC273
is about 1,500 million light years
away—and light travels at a
speed of 186,234 statute miles
per second.

Theories based on the assump-
tions of a space explosion or
collision could not account for
the tremendous radio energy
which continues to pour forth
from outer space.
