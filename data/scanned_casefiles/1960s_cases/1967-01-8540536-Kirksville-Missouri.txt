11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a M shaped object which was lighted by several colors of lights travel toward the north then make a turn toward the western horizon. The object was displaying red, gold, green, silver, and white lights. The object also appeared to have lights shining from it toward the ground. These lights were of an extremely bright nature. The object disappeared because the observer had to make a turn.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. Although the FAA reported no IFR traffic to their knowledge in the area an aircraft on VFR could have been responsible for the observation.
