SUMMARY.

State your own personal evaluation of the report. What do you think the object was? Do you think something other than the sighting motivated the caller? Do you include anything which may add to the objectivity of the report. Include your evaluation of the caller's reliability.

ACCORDING TO THE CALLER'S DESCRIPTION
HE DID PHOTOGRAPH SOME TYPE OF
OBJECT, RATHER THAN AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION. I WOULD NOT HOWEVER, EXCLUDE
THE POSSIBILITY OF UNCOMMONLY SHAPED HIGH
OR MIDDLE CLOUDS. I DID NOT FORM ANY OPINION
OF SOME OTHER MOTIVATION FOR CALLING.

I DID NOT ONE APPARENT CONTRADICTION; HE
SAID HE WAS JUST PHOTOGRAPHING A BEUTIFUL
SUNSET, YET HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOS
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE, IN FACT,
BEEN SHOOTING AT THE OBJECTS.

I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT
THE OUTCOME OF THIS REPORT IS AND WHAT
ACTION (IE ANY) IS TAKEN.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                27 Aug 63

Sub.: Photographs

Lt Conway from the Information Office at Suffolk County AFB called
Col Quintanilla on 27 August 1963 at 1445 hours. Lt Conway said
he had a UFO report that seemed rather important. He said the
problem was that a man inadvertently took a photograph of a UFO
while taking pictures of the sunset. The man claims they are
valuable photographs and will not send them into the Air Force because
they are so valuable and he has had numerous money offers from
magazines. He does want somebody from the AirForce to come out and
look at them though. Lt Conway said they did not have anyone there
who could go out and look at the photographs. Col Quintanilla
informed Lt Conway that the original negatives would have to be
looked at by photogrammetry personnel. Therefore, if the gentleman
wishes to have the Air Force look at the photographs he will have
to send the original negatives in and also provide the data required
in AFR 80-17. Col Quintanilla told Conway that this man is probably
trying to get the Air Force to say that his photographs are authentic.

Well all photographs are authentic, but the UFOs aren't. The man
who took the photographs is M[REDACTED] a New York Advertising
Agency and is a professional photographer. Col Quintanilla told Lt
Conway that if he speaks with Mr [REDACTED] on the telephone to insure
that his secretary is on the telephone to verify the conversation.

Lt Conway will inform the man that the Air Force cannot perform an
analysis without the original negatives and that he will be happy to
forward the original negatives to the proper personnel in photo
analysis.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                       23 August 1963

Subj: Photographs taken by Mr [redacted]

Mr [redacted], President of the Metro-Market Advertising Agency called Lt Colonel Quintanilla on 28 August 1968 regarding some photographs of unidentified flying objects that he accidentally took. Mr [redacted] informed Col Quintanilla that he had spoken with Lt Conaway at Suffolk County AFB with regards to the photographs. Mr [redacted] said that he and his other professional members had never seen anything quite like this, they are quite extraordinary. Mr [redacted] said he had never been interested in UFOs.

He said he had some of his top people study the photographs and knew it wasn't reflections, lens flares, inversions or birds. He said the objects are reflecting off of the sun, they have structural shape. He blew them up to 1ft in diameter with a projection screen. There is a good deal of details, with indentations, they have domes. Mr [redacted] said that since he thought there was no one more familiar with photographs than the Air Force than the Blue Book Office, he wanted to forward them to Wright-Patterson for analysis.

Col Quintanilla informed Mr [redacted] that he would turn them over to his photo analysis personnel. Mr [redacted] said he was sending them to Suffolk, Lt Conaway and Lt Conaway was going to send them to Wright-Patterson. Lt Conaway had asked him some questions over the telephone but they weren't very detailed.

At the time the photographs were taken they were crossing the Delaware River Bridge to New York, with a night camera he was taking pictures at 1/500 a second. Mr [redacted] wanted to be assured that he would get the full results of the photo analysis if he turned them over to the Air Force. Col Quintanilla informed him that he would receive the full report. He said that there company attorney thought he shouldn't send the original negatives into the Air Force but with Col Quintanilla's assurance that the original transparencies would be returned in the same condition that he forwarded them to the Air Force.


- page 17 -

he said he would go ahead and forward them to Lt Conway. Col Quintanilla
told Mr [redacted] he could mark the originals in any manner he wished so that
he could readily identify them as being the originals, especially since the
Air Force has been accused, in the past, of not having returned the originals
to observers. Mr [redacted] said he would not mark since he had viewed them
many times and was very familiar with the photographs. Mr [redacted] tried to
stress the fact that they were not quacks but were professional personnel, and
are not looking for publicity. Col Quintanilla informed Mr [redacted] that the
analysis would take 6 to 8 weeks, may be longer, may be shorter. It all
depended upon the fact that the photo analyst personnel must work on the
Southeast Asia work first. Mr [redacted] said this would be okay as long as
they had complete access to the analysis that would be accomplished. Mr
[redacted] then said he wanted to briefly explain the photographs. We were traveling
to Washington to take photographs of Resurrection City. In advertising we
are always taking photographs and we have a whole roomful of pictures, thus
the reason for the camera. Leaving New Jersey Turnpike when I noticed a
beautiful sky and the sun was setting into it. I had the camera outside
the car window and we were traveling approximately 65 mph. I was simply
snapping away. My vision was quite limited since we were in a small sports
car. I continued to take pictures while we crossed the bridge. It was not
until after the photographs had been developed and we were sitting in the
projection room that we say a series of very bright lights f that were over
the bridges. We just stopped and looked at them. There were two here and
two there. I have a pilots license and have never seen anything like this
before. Then then put the next photo on the screen. This shows the [redacted]
objects passing over the bridge, and perhaps it is 2 - 300 ft above the bridge.
These objects were disc shaped, with some with indentations. Very clear and
they look [redacted] metallic. The next photo shows them leaving the bridge,
going south, following the f path of the river. I had decreased the lens
2


- page 18 -

Opening, the objects are reflecting the light of the sun. There are three photographs. This is it more or less. There are three photographs, the first shows the outside of my car/the bridge is about 1½ miles in the distance, the next photograph we were on the bridge and the next photograph we have just about left the bridge.

Mr [redacted] phone number is [redacted] area code 212 and office phone is area code 212
