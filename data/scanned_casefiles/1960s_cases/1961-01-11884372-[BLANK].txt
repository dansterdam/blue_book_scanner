This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which was a program by the U.S. Air Force to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: Project BLUE BOOK (Close Book)
TO: APCIN-DE (Colonel Wyatt)

1. Project BLUE BOOK (Unidentified Flying Objects) program which was established and designated as 'Closed' following a much publicized place in view change in the objectives of the project.

a. To determine if unidentified flying objects constitute a threat to the security of the United States.
b. To determine if any scientific and/or technical information can be gained through the sighting of UFOs.
c. To identify and/or explain all UFO sightings.

In February 1949 the code name of the project was changed to 'GRUDGE' which was later changed to 'BLUE BOOK' in March 1952.

2. The directives which are applicable to this program are JANAP 146 and AFR 200-2 which require the collection, reporting and evaluation of the reports of sightings. The program is under the command and control of the Director of Information Services at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base who is responsible for releasing information on sightings and for coordinating with various agencies regarding the UFO program.

3. From June 1947 to date, December 1960, the Air Force has received a total of approximately 12,618 reports of which 10,147 have been explained and 2,471 remain unidentified or without explanation.

4. Allen Hynek, Project BLUE BOOK's Scientific Consultant and Head of the Astronomy Department, Northwestern University, stated that in his opinion the percentage of unexplained sightings, approximately 20% (2,471 out of 12,618), indicates that there is still a basis for continued scientific concern and that he is of the opinion that some of the reports received do contain substantive information which merits continued investigation.

The text appears to be a summary of the Project Blue Book program and its findings regarding unidentified flying objects.

AIR FORCE REGULATION
NO. 200-2

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

This regulation establishes the policies, responsibilities, and procedures for reporting sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and for conducting inquiries and investigations of such sightings.

SECTION A - GENERAL
Background Information

1. Background Information: The United States Air Force is directly responsible for the protection of the United States and its possessions against attacks by any missile, aircraft, or other aerial objects.

2. Definitions: To insure proper and uniform interpretation, the following definitions apply:
a. Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, and which cannot be definitely classified as a known object.

to be reported under this regulation as
the 3 types of flying objects mentioned
in paragraph 26.
(3) Pilotless aircraft and missiles.
Unidentified flying objects, regardless of
their characteristics or unusual features, does
not come within the scope of this regulation

and above.

3. Implications. Air Force interest in UFO's
is directed toward the security of the United States and its forces;
and, Air Force efforts in this field are limited
to the identification and evaluation of all such
sightings for any hostile or potentially hostile
implications, in accordance with the procedures
in paragraph 25.
as. As Defense, The basic security of flying
vehicles or objects of revolutionary configuration or propulsion characteristics may be of inter-
est to the United States, and the Air Force
maintains a continuing study of this field. However, it is emphasized that the basic interests
in this field are not related to the scientific
evaluation or publicity, but rather an essential
function of the Air Force, the detection of any
possible hostile or potentially hostile vehicle or
object, as defined in paragraph 25.

4. Technical and Scientific. The Air Force
will continue to collect and analyze any information on objects or phenomena of an extraterrestrial or unusual nature, which may be
returned from projects or activities. Such information will be properly evaluated and handled
in accordance with the following factors:
(1) The results of scientific or technical
examination should be published or made avail- able only when it is determined that the full
potential and significance of such findings have
been exploited for any possible hostile implica-
tions or intelligence value.
(2) Information on new or unique air
vehicles or phenomena should not be released
to the public, if such release might jeopardize the
national security.
(3) Knowledge gained from the scientific
study of the upper atmosphere, astronomy, and
the study of aerial phenomena may provide in-
formation on the nature of such phenomena. How-
ever, the full exploitation of such knowledge for
any possible hostile implications should be the
prime consideration. The scientific or technical
phenomena may provide.
(4) The potential of such apparent factors
as nuclear propulsion, special materials, new
guidance and control systems, advanced aero-
dynamic analyses and conclusions of UFO
sightings.

5. Reporting. Base commanders will report
all information available about UFOS sightings
immediately through channels to the Air Tech-
nical Intelligence Center (ATIC), Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Ohio. The necessity for rapid
and accurate reporting cannot be overstressed. (See section 6.)
Every effort. The command of the Air Force
will take every reasonable step to insure that
the reporting and investigation of such sightings
is carried out with the utmost discretion and
security. A UFO sighting will be handled with
the same degree of professional interest and
security consideration accorded any other intelli-
gence operation. (See section 6.)
The determination whether the reported
sighting is of enemy or friendly origin will require
a complete investigation. A BLUE BOOK message
will be sent immediately to ATIC advising of the
sighting and the progress of the investigation. A
final report will be submitted promptly upon com-
pletion of the investigation. (See paragraph 6.)
Appropriate action. The ATIC will analyze and
evaluate the information and evidence collected
in each case. The ATIC will conduct any further
investigation deemed necessary, and will be re-
sponsive to specific requests by the reporting
agency. The ATIC will provide the reporting
agency with the results of the analysis and eval-
uation. The ATIC may conduct or request any
additional investigation it considers appropriate.

6. Public Relations and Information Serv-
ice. The Office of Information Services, Air
Force, has the responsibility to represent the
Air Force officially on all public information.
Requests for information from the public regard-
ing UFO's will be referred to the Air Force
Office of Information Services. No officer, air-
man, or civilian employee of the Air Force will
comment publicly on any phase of the UFO
problem except under the specific authority
and control of the Air Force Office of Infor-
mation Services. See paragraphs 7 and 8.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text.

Here is the text from the document:

Legislative Liaison will:
(1) Be responsible for coordination with the ATIC and/or the various agencies when necessary, insure that the inquiries for information or assistance are answered promptly.
(2) Forward these inquiries which are assigned to the ATIC for the information to be obtained and the ATIC will return the information to the Legislative Liaison.
(3) Insure that the sources in accordance with AFR 12-5 are checked and all available services will be utilized to obtain the necessary economic and prompt success of inquiries and eliminate delay in transportation and other assistance.

A. Guidances:
The thoroughness and quality of investigations and reports depend only by the skill and resourcefulness of the personnel handling the initial inquiries and/or any report or investigation. Following the receipt of an inquiry or a report, the subsequent action depends on the nature and seriousness of the situation.

A careful study of the logic, consistency, and probability of the observers' reports are especially valuable in determining the degree of validity that should be given to the observer's age, occupation, and education, and to condition under which the object was observed. Thoroughness and completeness of the interview with the observer and the history of the observer's reliability, when available, should be completely familiar with certain aspects of a sighting in this or her specific qualifications should be evaluated.

The theodolite measurements of changes of azimuth and elevation and similar astronomical data are extremely valuable, if appropriate and within the scope of the investigation.

Control and warning (AC&W) units, pilots and ground control agencies should be alerted at the time and place of the sighting and requested to carry out special observations. The ATIC may require additional narrative statements, photographs, or other visual, electronic, or other documentation.

and charts, and other required data, whic
can reasonably be expected to reveal the
Air Force activity that made the initial re
port. When communication is authorized
tween ATIC and the public the details of
the sighting will be furnished to the indi
vidual concerned. In this event, the ATIC
Information Services will provide such re
lease.

SECTION B - PUBLIC RELATIONS
INFORMATION SERVICES
7. Maintaining Public Relations. The Office
of Information Services is responsible for
maintaining all liaison and coordination
with the press, radio, television, and other
media, and for releasing information on
UFO sightings and investigation findings to
the public, subject to the general policy...

8. Releasing Information. All information
conceDnhng UFO sightings and investigation
findings will be released only by the Office
of Information Services. Information re
quested by the public, press, radio, or tele
vision concerning UFO sightings or investi
gations will be referred directly to ATIC and
other Air Force activities by the Office of In
formation Services. No other Air Force per
sonnel or agency will release any information
on the subject of UFO sightings.

9. Responses. In response to local inquiries
or letters, any UFO reports in the files of an
Air Force base, information regarding Air
Force experience with UFO phenomena, or
reactions to statements regarding UFO sight
ings, the response will be limited to a state
ment that the information has been forwarded
to the Office of Information Services, ATIC
for appropriate action. Care should be exer
cised that to reveal any details of the sighting
or to comment on the reality of the sighting
would be in conflict with the provisions of
this regulation.

10. Release By Non-AF Persons. When indi
viduals, such as publishers, writers, or radio
and television commentators, request infor
mation or interviews on the subject of UFOs,
the response will be that all such inquiries
and allegations of these individuals will be
referred to the Office of Information Services,
ATIC, Brooks AFB, Texas. No Air Force per
sonnel other than the Director of Information
Services, or a designated representative, will
comment on UFO sightings or investigations,
except on a "need-to-know" basis.

SECTION C - REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
12. General Information. Reports of UFO
sightings and the results of investigations
will be submitted in accordance with the pro
visions of this regulation. The format will be
as prescribed in Attachment 1, and guidance
for reporting will be as contained in para
graphs 13 through 18. The details of reports
of aerial objects and phenomena, and the
results of investigations, will not be made
available to the public by any Air Force per
sonnel other than the Director of Information
Services or a designated representative.

crs, and the public in general, by
correspondence, telephone, or per-

sonal interview by military person-
nel, are major sources from which
UFO reports are received.

(2) Generally, UFO reports received from
civilian and military sources contain
the following basic information:

(a) Date and time of sighting.
(b) Location of observer.
(c) Description of object or phenomenon.
(d) Actions taken such as, reporting to
next higher headquarters, attempted
interception, or further investigation.

13. Methods for Transmitting Reports
a. Included in the military reporting system
is the requirement, in addition to the other
mandatory reporting, all information on UFO's
will be reported promptly. Reports may be
telephonically or radio transmitted, and will be confirmed by a written report within 72 hours as
a minimum procedure.

b. Civilian sources - As a general procedure, written reports should be submitted on AF Form 112, Air In-
telligence Information REPORT, and AF
Form 112A, Continuation Sheet. (See paragraphs 14 and 15); however, their use
should be left to the discretion of the official
receiving the reports. Other sources, including
telephone or telegram, telegrams and personal
contacts may make follow-up investigations difficult, since basic information may be lacking
or incomplete.
