October 7, 1966, between the hours of and 8:43 P.M.

I and my wife were traveling from East direction, to the East it traveled across the sky about 10 seconds, at first the only thing we saw was a bright light, out of sight, behind trees, come. This was our neighbors too, and to us the object, to a halt they just slowed. I then discouraged, went outside, and look again, but then went back to the middle of the sky, it made toward us, this gigantic red object appeared, moving very fast away the believing object. We looked at it as a red green, and yellow lights sort of around the middle of it, then as this object stop it had a white flash of light from it, about 4 or 5 minutes later it moved up the sky to the west that was the last we saw of it.

Sincerely yours,
