Dear Sir:

On October 7, 1966, between the hours of 8:10 P.M. and 8:45 P.M., and my self saw what we believe to be a U.F.O. we followed it from a pair of field glasses it was traveling from Southeasterly direction to the East, it traveled across the sky in about 10 seconds, at first the only thing we saw, was a light, blinking off and on rapidly. Then it went out of sight behind some hills. We went to a neighbors house, and to use the phone to report it, but they just laughed. Then discouraged we went outside, and saw it again. It went Southeasterly then went back to the middle of the sky. It stop, it move toward us, then zig-zagged up to right, then it move toward the East. Then a such object appeared moving very fast away from the blinking object. We looked at it clearly and a red glow and yellow lights sort of rotating went the middle of it. Then as the object stop it had a white flash of light coming from it. A bout five minutes later we looked to the Southwest, and saw it again. It move up the down, the to the west, and that way the last we saw of it.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature and name redacted]
