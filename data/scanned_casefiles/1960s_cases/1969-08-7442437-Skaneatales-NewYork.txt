[Top of document header section - partially illegible]

IF A FULL MOON FLASHED ON IN 1-2 SECOND INTERVALS WT WOULD APPEAR VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TWICE AS LARGE AND A LITTLE BRIGHTER, BUT THE COLOR AND SHAPE IS VERY CLOSE.

[Bottom section of document]

WHEN WE ARRIVED AT STEVE'S WE WERE KEPT FOR THE OBJECT AGAIN AND THEN THEY SAID WE WERE WATCHING. THAT IT WAS JUST OUR IMAGINATION, WE DID HEAR A LOW RUMBLING NOISE COMING IN SIMILAR INTERVALS AS THE PHENOMENON, AND THAT WAS FOR CERTAIN, BECAUSE IT WAS COMING FROM A DEFINITE DIRECTION WE DISREGARDED IT.

WE DID NOT SEE THE GROUND THAT IT WAS NEAR.

August 27, 1959

U.F.O. Headquarters
Colorado Springs, Colo.

Dear Sirs,

We are writing this letter to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Skaneateles, New York, on Aug. 26 at 12:15 A.M. These are the circumstances surrounding the sighting:

Three of us were approaching East Lake Road on Woodland Road when two of us noticed a bright flash near the horizon. It was a road form about two miles from the full moon and perhaps some 10 degrees in color. The flash lasted about a second, then faded out. We knew it was not a meteor because the moon was behind us and the object was much brighter. Also, the object was off the ground, about 10 degrees up from the horizon.

About fifteen seconds later we saw a second flash. This time the object appeared to be moving into a low cloud bank. Only a small part of the cloud bank was lit by the flash. Leaving us to believe that it was not lightning. Flashes appeared at irregular intervals as the object seemed to continue moving eastward. It was too bright, in our opinion, to be a beacon or search light.

We took one of our friends home because he requested it. Leaving the car at his house we thought we saw the flash reappear and still were not certain. Our friend noticed a low, rumbling sound at irregular intervals. We discussed the sound a moment because it seemed to be coming from a definite direction.

Returning to Woodland Road we again, looked for the object. We thought we saw a similar light from the same direction coming from below the horizon. We then drove to the top of a hill on Cisco Lake Road, that listened point around, but we saw nothing.

On returning home we recounted our experience to our parents and we were advised to write this letter. We checked the local newspaper but, apparently, no one else had noticed it.

If we can be of any other assistance our addresses follows:

Thomas Owens

Two or my friends were out about midnight one ride home from a town near my house. My other friend was staying at camp that night. We were quite late. After going to a joint for about 15 minutes, we were quite late up by the incident. Wanted to be taken home. I did not want to drive, so I drove him to his camp. We were a summer camp about 4 miles up the lake from camp.

Quite two and a half miles out of King Village (Skaneateles), by the time we reached camp, we had all settled down enough that we got out of the car to see if we could still see the object. We thought that we saw the object flash from behind the clouds through a tree, but we cannot be certain.

We did not definitely hear a sound come from the direction of the object.

I returned to the camp site in my driveway but were unable to see or hear anything. We then drove to the top of the hill over which we had first sighted the object. This was on Tibbo Lake Park, otherwise known as Forest Hill Park. We also saw a road nearby. Returning home, we recounted our experience to my mother.

The following day I look in the local newspapers and listened to the news but hear nothing of anyone else spotting the object.

Within the next few days, wrote our letter to Air Force requesting the sighting.

Then you yours truly.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON?
DAY 26   MONTH AUG   YEAR 1964

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 12   MINUTES 15   AM ☒   PM ☐

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 12   MINUTES 40   AM ☒   PM ☐

4. TIME ZONE ☒EASTERN ☐CENTRAL ☐MOUNTAIN ☐PACIFIC ☐STANDARD ☐OTHER

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A MAP WHERE YOU WERE. IF IN THE COUNTRY, DESCRIBE WHERE YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO GIVE A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME LANDMARK.

WE WERE ON WOODARD ROAD (RN. WATCH) LEADING TO LAKE CAMP ON SKANEATELES LAKE (HWY. RT. 41)
WE WERE APPROACHING EAST LAKE ROAD (HWY. RT. 41)
WE WERE APPROXIMATELY 50 YARDS FROM THE MAIN HIGHWAY.

[The document includes a hand-drawn diagram showing an angular measurement, with a handwritten note: "A,B (THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE RISING UPWARD.)"]

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

[Top compass diagram text]
INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION.

[Handwritten text on right side of compass]
9.8 CASE HEARD,
THE OBJECT
DID NOT APPEAR
TO BE MOVING
EITHER
DIRECTION

[Bottom text block]
IN THE NEXT BLOCK PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THIS IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT OR CURVED. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

[Handwritten text on bottom right of image]
THE ONLY MOVEMENT I WAS ABLE TO DETECT WAS THAT SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM 15° WHICH, BECAUSE ACTED NO OTHER SHIFTS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STEADY.

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

[Form Checkboxes]
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON:
X IN CAR
X AS PASSENGER

[Directional Checkboxes]
NEAR AIRFIELD
FLYING OVER CITY
FLYING OVER OPEN COUNTRY

IF YOU WERE IN A VEHICLE, COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING:
WHAT DIRECTION WERE YOU MOVING: APPROX. 20MPH, ON DIRT ROAD NEAR OLD SALT PLANT
WHAT WAS YOUR SPEED:
EAST
WEST
NORTH
SOUTH
NORTHEAST
NORTHWEST
SOUTHEAST
SOUTHWEST

EXPLAIN WHAT SUCH MOVEMENT AFFECTS IN TERMS OF SKETCHES IN ITEMS 3 AND 4:
NO, IT WASN'T AS I SAID ABOVE. HE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY
AFTER HE SAW IT. WE WERE IN AN OPEN TYPE OF TERRAIN ON BODY OF WATER YOU TRAVERSED DURING
INCIDENT. WE WERE IN A 1964 FORD SCORPIO ON A DIRT ROAD. WE SAW THE OBJECT THROUGH
WINDSHIELD (OTHER WILLING WERE UP)

NAME: [Illegible]

LENGTH OF TIME: IT LASTED FOR 1-2 SECOND
INTERVALS

HOW WAS TIME DETERMINED: THE FLASHES WERE VERY SHORT SO WE DETERMINED

THIS WAS DUE TO OUR MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE HAD STOPPED THE FIRST TIME WE SAW THE OBJECT. IT HAD A DEFINITE
CIRCULAR SHAPE BUT QUICKLY FADED OUT. AROUND IS SECONDS LATER WE ACTED THE FLASH AGAIN BUT THIS TIME IT
HAD NO DEFINITE SHAPE BUT WAS STILL AS BRIGHT. IT APPEARED BEHIND A "COLD BANK" THAT TIME SO WE ASSUMED
THAT IT MAY BE MOVING ALONG FROM US. WE WERE PERHAPS IN THE SAME FLASH AT LEAST FIVE TIMES OR 2 SECONDS.

PAGE 10 OF 3 PAGES


- page 20 -

AFR 200-2(C1)

WE ONLY SAW ONE FLASH AT A TIME SO WE ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ONLY ONE PHENOMENON

[Detailed table with cloud conditions, sky conditions, etc. with some boxes checked]

IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?
[Various options checked, including "BRIGHT MOONLIGHT"]

IF SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE? [Checked: NO]

LIGHT SOURCE DESCRIPTION:
TO THE RIGHT ABLE AND A LITTLE BEHIND THE CAR IT WAS MUCH LIKE A HEADLIGHT, SOMEWHAT BRIGHTER. APPEARED AS A POINT OF LIGHT. INDICATED COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS.

THE FIRST TIME IT WAS BOLD WITH SHARP EDGES, VERY BRIGHT AND LARGE YELLOW IN COLOR. IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE THEN AGAIN THAT MIGHT YET IT WAS LIKE THE SIZE OF IT AND MUCH MORE UNCLEAR. IN OTHER WORDS LIT THE SKY MORE, WHERE THE FLASH HAS SO KEPT IT WOULD BE HARD TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS TRANSPARENT OR NOT, YET THE FLASH WHERE IT HAD DEFINITE SHAPE APPEARED TO BE SOLID. IT FADED INTO YELLOW BANK (THE ONLY ONE IN THE SKY) AND THIS HAD NO DEFINITE SHAPE.

PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES


- page 21 -

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

[Checklist section at top with various boxes checked/unchecked]

NOTICED THE ROUND SHAPE AS WE WERE DRIVING UP WOODLAND BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO THE OTHERS BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING THINGS. WHEN THE SECOND FLASH APPEARED WE ALL NOTICED IT AND OF COURSE WERE ALARMED. AS WE BEGAN TO DISCUSS IT I FOUND OUT THAT AND NOTICED THE FIRST FLASH TOO. IT WAS DIRECTLY CUT OF IT SUBSIDED SO WE UNANIMOUSLY HAD TO NOTICE IT.

WE DON'T KNOW [REDACTED] (THE 3RD PASSENGER IN THE CAR) REQUESTED THAT WE TAKE HIM HOME. HE WAS RATHER SHOOK UP BY IT. WHEN WE GOT TO HIS PLACE (ABOUT 4 MILES DOWN THE ROAD) WE LOOKED FOR IT AGAIN BUT COULD NOT SEE IT. WE HAD LOST OUR PERSPECTIVE AND IT WAS HARD TO GET THE DIRECTION OF IT AGAIN. BACK AGAIN CLOSE TO THE GROUND [PARTIALLY ILLEGIBLE]

IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM US INTO A LOW CLOUD BANK, THE ONLY CLOUDS IN THE SKY. THIS IS WHY IT ONLY HAD A DEFINITE SHAPE ONCE, THE LIGHT HIT THE [ILLEGIBLE] END OF THE CLOUD BANK, NOT THE WHOLE THING. THAT IS WHY WE DISREGARD IT AS LIGHTING (AS WELL IS FOR OTHER REASONS)

PAGE 50 OF 3 PAGES


- page 22 -

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

A PICTURE IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE IT HAD A DEFINITE SHAPE CALL CRUCE AND WE ARE POSITIVE OF THAT DESCRIPTION - A ROUND CIRCULAR FORM, CHANGE IN COLOR. IT HAD NO WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS. IT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT ANY SMALL DETAILS COULD NOT BE DETECTED.

IT WAS APPROXIMATELY TWICE THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON. IT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A PENNY AT ARM'S LENGTH.
