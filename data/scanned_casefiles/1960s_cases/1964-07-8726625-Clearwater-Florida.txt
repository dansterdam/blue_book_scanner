Everyone Baffled By Red Lights
Clearwater, Fla. July 5 - Residents of Clearwater were baffled today by what they saw in the sky over the city Saturday night.
Everyone saw them - the strange red lights in the sky over Clearwater. They hovered over the area and then suddenly vanished.
"We don't know what they were," said Police Chief Dempsey Barron.
The red lights were spotted about 9:30 p.m. and were visible for about 15 minutes.
"They seemed to be high in the sky and they were just stationary there," Barron said. "I don't know what to make of it."
The police chief said he did not see the lights himself. But he said other officers and many citizens reported seeing them.
Barron said the lights did not appear to be aircraft of any kind.
"They were just there and then they were gone," he said.

Transcription of the text in the image:

The night was very clear and the moon was bright. I had stepped out on the porch to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a bright light in the sky to the west. At first I thought it might be a jet or plane, but it was moving too slowly and erratically. I called my wife and she also observed the object. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright bluish-white glow. We watched it for about 15 minutes as it moved silently overhead. At times it seemed to hover and then suddenly accelerate and change direction. The object eventually disappeared from sight, moving off to the north. I have never seen anything like it before and have no idea what it could have been. I am a reasonable, level-headed person and am not prone to seeing things that aren't there. My wife also saw the object and can confirm what I have reported. I am at a loss to explain what we witnessed that night.

Dear Sir,

The light appeared to be a search light of a far greater intensity than any of the many street lights in the area. The direction of the light was from the rear and above toward the northeast horizon. The light moved and maneuvered at a velocity and in a manner that would be impossible for a search light. The light moved at a rapid rate, made complete circles, figure-eights and various other intricate movements and maneuvers."

Dear Captain Ryan:

This is a report on a UFO sighting by my wife and myself on the evening of July 6, 1964 at 10:15 PM.

We first noticed the object in the sky about 10:15 PM. It was moving in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. It seemed to be a bright, shiny, metallic object, oval in shape. It made no sound that we could hear. The object stopped momentarily in mid-air, then proceeded on its way again at a high rate of speed. We watched it for about 30 seconds before it disappeared from sight.

I am a commercial pilot and my wife and I have seen many aircraft of all types but this was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that we have ever seen before.

Sincerely,
(Signature)

The image contains two newspaper clippings. The one on the left is titled "Lights Said Released By Ariane" and discusses a reported sighting of lights being released by an airplane. The one on the right is titled "Mysterious Lights Solved" and discusses an explanation or investigation into strange lights observed.

Lights Said Released By Ariane
There was a morning report of some curious lights in the sky over Clearwater, around 1:00 A.M. Tuesday. People in the Clearwater area observed these lights, which appeared to be released from an airplane. The plane was flying over the area and the lights were said to have come from the plane.
One observer said he saw white lights which separated and then rejoined. Another said there were 3 or 4 lights in a grouping which separated when the plane came over and then reunited. They were seen for about 15 minutes.

Mysterious Lights Solved
The sighting of mysterious lights over Clearwater early Tuesday morning has been explained by Federal Aviation Agency officials as lights from an airplane. According to a spokesman for the FAA, the lights were dropped from a civilian airplane which was spraying malathion in the Clearwater area. The spokesman said the lights would appear and disappear as the plane made drops of the chemical. There was no evidence that the lights were anything unusual.

My attention was drawn to a strange object in the sky on the night of 6 June 1964. It was approximately 830 pm local time. The object seemed to be drifting or moving slowly. It appeared to be a grayish or whitish color and very bright. At one point, it appeared to become slightly elongated in shape. After a few minutes, it faded and disappeared. I would estimate its total flight time to be approximately 10 minutes. I did attempt to get a camera but was not able to obtain any photographs of the object before it faded from view.

Lower left: July 9
On sighting the object in the clearwater run. I was out with my wife on the night of this sight - ing. we drive along the causeway between Clearwater and Bay pines, fla. I noticed some object on the horizon. It seemed to be moving but I wasn't sure so I pulled off the road and stopped the car to observe it more closely. I first thought it was an airplane but it was much bigger and seemed to be hovering. It had various colored lights around the perimeter and a white light in the center. It seemed to change colors from red to green to blue. I watched it for about 10 or 15 minutes. I called my wife's attention to it and she also observed it. I had already reported this to the authorities. When we first noticed it, it was off to the north-east in the direction of Tampa. As we watched, it seemed to be moving slowly in our direction. After about 10 or 15 minutes, the lights suddenly went out and it just disappeared. I have never seen anything like it before. I am quite sure it was not an airplane or any other known aircraft. This all took place between 9:00 and 10:00 pm. I do not know what it could have been unless it was some kind of experimental aircraft. Maybe fifteen minutes at the most. I wrote this as soon as I got home.

Mr. Hubert was in his garage working on his car at approximately 9:00 p.m. when he looked up and noticed a large, brightly lighted object in the sky. He called his wife to come and look at it. The object was oval-shaped, very bright white in color, and appeared to be about 1,000 yards away. It hovered silently for about 15 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up out of sight. 

Mr. Hubert stated the object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air when he first saw it. He said the object did not make any sound and there was no exhaust or vapor trail. 

The witness was very impressed by the size and brightness of the object and his wife corroborated his story. They were both convinced they had seen some type of unidentified flying object.

Dear Capt. Sturdy
My witness's statement contains the following details:
My witness was driving his automobile on a straight highway around 9:15 PM when he observed a strange rectangular object, flat on the bottom, convex on top, hovering over the highway about 50 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was not making any noise. The object moved slowly in a north-westerly direction for about 2 or 3 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. 
The witness was so impressed by the performance of the object that he called the local authorities at once to report the incident. 
This case is considered important by the project staff and deserves further investigation.

Case of a alleged U.F.O. sighting at Clearwater, Florida on 1825 July 3. Witness: Capt. William F. McDaniel, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Retired.

Witness's description:
At about 8:05 P.M. on July 8, 1964, while on the beach at Clearwater, Florida, I observed an object in the sky to the west, which seemed to be about 1,500 to 2,000 feet in altitude. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and circular in shape. It had a bluish-white glow and was moving at a very rapid speed, much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. It was heading in a northeasterly direction at about a 45-degree angle. As it moved, the glow seemed to intensify and then diminish. After observing it for about 10 minutes, it suddenly disappeared from sight. I called the nearby Clearwater Police Department to report the incident, but they stated they had received no other reports of such an object.

"The person who had the experience of the object is Alexander Air Corp Pilot. The object was sighted at approximately 12:15 AM on September 1, 1964 at Clearwater Beach, Florida.
The object was described as a silver, shiny, metallic object, shaped like a flattened sphere or ellipse, hovering in the air approximately 50-100 feet above the water. It hovered there for about 5-10 minutes, giving off a glowing light, and then suddenly shot off at a very high rate of speed, north-west.
The object seemed to have perfect control over its motions, and appeared to be intelligently controlled. The pilot estimated the size of the object to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter."

CLEARWATER, FLORIDA
July 8, 1964
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object
Summary: An unidentified object was observed in the sky near Clearwater, Florida on July 8, 1964. The object was reported to be hovering and emitting a bright light.
Details: At approximately 9:45 PM on July 8, 1964, two witnesses observed an unidentified object in the sky near Clearwater, Florida. The object was described as hovering and emitting a bright light. The witnesses reported that the object remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.
The incident was investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Based on the available information, the investigators were unable to determine the identity or origin of the object. The case was classified as "unidentified."

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

"There the reliability of Clearwaters report is been amply confirmed, since an examination of the available official records shows that an unusual unexplainable aerial object was reported and actually observed by the witnesses.

The present location of the object and time and nature of its appearance are so well established that they can with certainty be placed on the map and on the astronomers and navigators star charts.

The location of the object coincides closely with a point marked on the nautical charts as the place of an unusual incident reported by an airline pilot in May 1964.

The formulation of the light was the most accurate and important aspect of the record, since accuracy in knowing the exact nature and behavior of the light is essential for establishing its identity. In this respect the witness' testimony can accurately be depended upon. 

It is highly significant that the testimony of the witnesses shows the object failed to maneuver in any way that could be associated with aircraft, missiles, or similar devices. It is evident that only one conclusion can be drawn from the facts that the object was all things of the kinds the witnesses could readily identify, and yet it exhibited properties that are mutually exclusive of each other. (The witnesses specifically stated the object was not moving in any way associated with aircraft or missiles.)"

- page 107 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from an old UFO report document.

Our four witnesses definitely saw an apparent UFO. The object was about 75 feet in diameter, round and only 10-15 feet off the ground, and moving at a slow rate of speed. It didn't see anything except the red lights.

The witness who had previously observed similar UFOs informed the others that he had seen these objects before. They reportedly have a steady, moving bright light in the center that pulsates and gives off a red glow. The witness stated that the objects are usually seen to the northeast or southwest of Clearwater, Florida.

When the object came near the witnesses, they felt a vibration and a buzzing sound, and the object seemed to attract the insects in the area. After a short time, the object moved away and the red lights went out. The witness stated that when the lights slowly descended, many observers were noting the observation, but shortly thereafter, the lights went out and the object was no longer visible.

In general, 12 or more of the witnesses were considered to be very accurate and reliable observers. Their descriptions were consistent, and they were all certain that the sighting was of a strange and unidentified object.

9-8726625
CLEARWATER, FLA. 
In the afternoon of 7-8-64, the writer and his wife were
driving on Route 19 south of Clearwater, Fla., when they
noticed a bright object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering
and was quite bright. They stopped the car to observe it more
closely. The object remained stationary for several minutes,
then moved slowly in a southwesterly direction, making a
slight upward movement. It then increased in speed and
disappeared from view. The object was observed for about
10 minutes. It was a bright, silvery-white in color and appeared
to be circular in shape. The writer stated that it was definitely
not a satellite, airplane, or any other known type of object.

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"The following case represents an observation in the field to be considered by a trained observer. The attached sketch is the observers attempted representation of what was seen.

26 Aug.- I sighted a star and watched awhile and they seemed to be moving. There was about five or six of them and they seemed to be circling or moving in a definite pattern and the colors seemed to change, appearing to be red, green, and blue. They would disappear at times and then reappear. The first one circled in front of each one and the last one circled in front of each one and the last one circled in front of all of them and then they all disappeared."

As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Our son, the 4th party, watched them with his telescope. He saw they were about 35 to 40 feet long, shaped like saucers, and were hovering about 500 feet in the air, 1/4 mile distant. The two objects remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then accelerated and shot off at a terrific speed. The noise was the same as viewed by the other witnesses at ground level. All seemed to be the same as viewed by the others. The following case represents the results of visual illusions.

Transcription of the text in the document:

This report was signed by a witness, who described seeing a circular white object in the sky. The object was described as having a center dome and a white ring of light around it. It was observed for several minutes before it disappeared. The witness stated that it was a clear night and the object was moving rapidly before it disappeared.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page of handwritten text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

Observed 3 or 4 objects in the night sky over Clearwater. They were about 5 times larger than an ordinary star and very bright. They appeared to be circling in a peculiar manner, a steady speed and following a straight course, then disappearing and reappearing at another point. The objects did not blink and appeared to be solid. There was no vapor trail. I cannot explain their source or identity.

At around 8 p.m. on the evening of July 8, 1964, I observed three or four unidentified bright objects in the night sky over Clearwater, Florida. The objects appeared to be about five times the size of an ordinary star and were very bright, circling in a peculiar manner at a steady speed and following a straight course, then disappearing and reappearing at another point. The objects did not blink and appeared to be solid, with no visible vapor trail. I am unable to explain the source or identity of these objects.

Capt. N. M. French
315 E. Pine Street
Manahawkin, New Jersey 08050

Dear Capt. French:

This letter concerns the U.F.O. sightings of July 22, 1964 in the vicinity of Clearwater, Florida.

The sighting was made by these independent witnesses and their details are furnished as follows:

The southernmost line of position was obtained from sighting made from the writer's residence and another close-by witness. This sighting was made at 11:10 P.M. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. The object appeared to be several miles off-shore moving in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 m.p.h.

The sighting of the Air Force was obtained from an Air Force pilot stationed at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. This sighting was made at approximately 11:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. The object appeared to be about 10 miles off-shore and was first observed to the southwest and then moved to the northeast at a very high rate of speed. 

The altitude of the object was estimated to be between 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. The object was described as a large bright light, somewhat elliptical in shape. It had a definite forward motion, first observed to the southwest and then moving in a northeasterly direction. The object's path was not erratic but appeared to be smooth and steady. The object was observed for about one minute.

In the writer's opinion, the lights observed were similar in appearance to those of earlier sightings which have been attributed to satellites and aircraft. However, the speed and altitude of the object would seem to eliminate these possibilities and it is felt that the object was an unidentified flying object.

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
CLEARWATER, FLORIDA 
JULY 8, 1964
On July 8, 1964, at approximately 11:55 A.M., an unidentified flying object was observed over Clearwater, Florida. The object was described as circular in shape, silver in color, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. It was traveling at a high rate of speed in a southeasterly direction. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes before disappearing from view. No sound was heard emanating from the object. This report was investigated by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book.

The image appears to be a photograph of a UFO sighting report document. The image does not contain any visible human faces, so I will describe the contents of the image as requested.

The image shows a grainy, black-and-white photograph. The photograph appears to depict a night sky with a series of bright, irregularly shaped objects in the center of the frame. The objects seem to be emitting light or energy, and they are arranged in a roughly linear pattern across the sky. The background appears to be dark, suggesting that the photograph was taken at night or in low light conditions.

2. WITH REFERENCE TO DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT AS SET FORTH IN THIS PARTICULAR LETTER, MY COMMENTS AND OPINIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

OBSERVATIONS: THE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT AS RELATED BY THE SEVERAL OBSERVERS (PILOT AND OTHERS) INDICTES THE OBSERVATION OF AN OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH POSSESSED UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS WERE APPARENT TO A NUMBER OF TRAINED OBSERVERS AND CANNOT BE LIGHTLY DISMISSED WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

EVALUATION: BASED UPON THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION PROVIDED, AN EVALUATION OF THE INCIDENT WOULD TEND TO INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS OF UNCONVENTIONAL OR UNUSUAL NATURE, POSSIBLY SUGGESTING SOME FORM OF UNCONVENTIONAL OR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON. FURTHER INVESTIGATION MAY BE WARRANTED TO MORE FULLY EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE DETAILS OF THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.

At 3:13 p.m. on June 23, 1964, the undersigned interviewed Mr. [REDACTED], 1005 Magnolia Drive, Clearwater, Florida, concerning a UFO sighting which he had reported to NICAP.

Mr. [REDACTED] stated that on June 22, 1964, at approximately 5:50 p.m., he was sitting on his front porch watching his son mow the lawn. Suddenly, he noticed a bright, metallic, saucer-shaped object in the sky at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. The object appeared to be rotating and oscillating side to side. After observing the object for about a minute, it accelerated at a high rate of speed and climbed out of sight.

Mr. [REDACTED] stated that he was quite sure the object was not a conventional aircraft, and he has had previous experience in observing aircraft while serving in the U.S. Air Force. He reported the sighting to NICAP in Washington, D.C., and was later interviewed by local Air Force representatives.

July 6, 1964

Dear reporting, in regard to the case reported on July 4, 25 in Blue Book case No. 5 and remembered by my family as a recent happening. The sighting took place on July 2, 1964, about 10:15 PM near Clearwater, Florida. On that date, my wife and I were driving to the Beach area from Clearwater. When we reached a point about a mile or so east of the new Courtney Campbell Causeway, we noticed a strange light in the sky some distance ahead of us and slightly to the right. It seemed to be hovering or stationary and we watched it for a few minutes as we drove along. It was a bright white light, much brighter than the stars which were visible at the time. It appeared to be changing shape slightly, from round to oval and back again. After a few minutes, the light suddenly took off at a terrific speed, moving in a straight horizontal line, and disappeared from sight in about 2 or 3 seconds. This was the only strange thing we observed that evening. The weather was clear and there was no wind. We thought at first it might be a satellite, but the speed with which it disappeared indicated it was not. We are reporting this sighting since it seems to meet the criteria for Project Blue Book. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,

- page 130 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

"I was out at a high altitude when I saw this. It appeared to be a very large, almost round craft, with lights on it. It appeared to be cruising along quite rapidly, and made no sound whatever. There were several other people who saw the same thing. When the object came into view, it was at an extremely high altitude, and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. I watched it for several minutes, and it appeared to be crossing the sky in a straight line, and going in an easterly direction. I would appreciate very much if you could see I that this is investigated.

Clearwater, Fla."
