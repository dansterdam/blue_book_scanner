Everyone Baffled By Red Lights
Clearwater, Fla. July 5 - Residents of Clearwater were baffled today by what they saw in the sky over the city Saturday night.
Everyone saw them - the strange red lights in the sky over Clearwater. They hovered over the area and then suddenly vanished.
"We don't know what they were," said Police Chief Dempsey Barron.
The red lights were spotted about 9:30 p.m. and were visible for about 15 minutes.
"They seemed to be high in the sky and they were just stationary there," Barron said. "I don't know what to make of it."
The police chief said he did not see the lights himself. But he said other officers and many citizens reported seeing them.
Barron said the lights did not appear to be aircraft of any kind.
"They were just there and then they were gone," he said.
The police chief said no one has been able to offer any explanation for the strange sight.

Transcription of the text in the image:

The night was very clear and the moon was bright. I had stepped out on the porch to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a bright light in the sky to the west. At first I thought it might be a jet or plane, but it was moving too slowly and erratically. I called my wife and she also observed the object. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright bluish-white glow. We watched it for about 15 minutes as it moved silently overhead. At times it seemed to hover and then suddenly accelerate and change direction. The object eventually disappeared from sight, moving off to the north. I have never seen anything like it before and have no idea what it could have been. I am a reasonable, level-headed person and am not prone to seeing things that aren't there. My wife also saw the object and can confirm what I have reported. I am at a loss to explain what we witnessed that night.

Dear Sir,

The light appeared to be a search light of a far greater intensity than any of the many street lights in the area. The direction of the light was from the rear and above toward the northeast horizon. The light moved and maneuvered at a velocity and in a manner that would be impossible for a search light. The light moved at a rapid rate, made complete circles, figure-eights and various other intricate movements and maneuvers."

Dear Captain Ryan:

This is a report on a UFO sighting by my wife and myself on the evening of July 6, 1964 at 10:15 PM.

We first noticed the object in the sky about 10:15 PM. It was moving in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. It seemed to be a bright, shiny, metallic object, oval in shape. It made no sound that we could hear. The object stopped momentarily in mid-air, then proceeded on its way again at a high rate of speed. We watched it for about 30 seconds before it disappeared from sight.

I am a commercial pilot and my wife and I have seen many aircraft of all types but this was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that we have ever seen before.

Sincerely,
(Signature)

in the sky. The object moved slowly in a

gold-colored glow around the outer edge,

visible lights or wings. The witness 
stated that the object moved silently. 
After observing the object for several

The image contains two newspaper clippings. The one on the left is titled "Lights Said Released By Ariane" and discusses a reported sighting of lights being released by an airplane. The one on the right is titled "Mysterious Lights Solved" and discusses an explanation or investigation into strange lights observed.

Lights Said Released By Ariane
There was a morning report of some curious lights in the sky over Clearwater, around 1:00 A.M. Tuesday. People in the Clearwater area observed these lights, which appeared to be released from an airplane. The plane was flying over the area and the lights were said to have come from the plane.
One observer said he saw white lights which separated and then rejoined. Another said there were 3 or 4 lights in a grouping which separated when the plane came over and then reunited. They were seen for about 15 minutes.

Mysterious Lights Solved
The sighting of mysterious lights over Clearwater early Tuesday morning has been explained by Federal Aviation Agency officials as lights from an airplane. According to a spokesman for the FAA, the lights were dropped from a civilian airplane which was spraying malathion in the Clearwater area. The spokesman said the lights would appear and disappear as the plane made drops of the chemical. There was no evidence that the lights were anything unusual.

My attention was drawn to a strange object in the sky on the night of 6 June 1964. It was approximately 830 pm local time. The object seemed to be drifting or moving slowly. It appeared to be a grayish or whitish color and very bright. At one point, it appeared to become slightly elongated in shape. After a few minutes, it faded and disappeared. I would estimate its total flight time to be approximately 10 minutes. I did attempt to get a camera but was not able to obtain any photographs of the object before it faded from view.

It seemed to hover for a short period, then decreased in size and brightness and finally disappeared from sight. The witness estimated the total time of observation to be about one minute.

Lower left: July 9
On sighting the object in the clearwater run. I was out with my wife on the night of this sight - ing. we drive along the causeway between Clearwater and Bay pines, fla. I noticed some object on the horizon. It seemed to be moving but I wasn't sure so I pulled off the road and stopped the car to observe it more closely. I first thought it was an airplane but it was much bigger and seemed to be hovering. It had various colored lights around the perimeter and a white light in the center. It seemed to change colors from red to green to blue. I watched it for about 10 or 15 minutes. I called my wife's attention to it and she also observed it. I had already reported this to the authorities. When we first noticed it, it was off to the north-east in the direction of Tampa. As we watched, it seemed to be moving slowly in our direction. After about 10 or 15 minutes, the lights suddenly went out and it just disappeared. I have never seen anything like it before. I am quite sure it was not an airplane or any other known aircraft. This all took place between 9:00 and 10:00 pm. I do not know what it could have been unless it was some kind of experimental aircraft. Maybe fifteen minutes at the most. I wrote this as soon as I got home.

Mr. Hubert was in his garage working on his car at approximately 9:00 p.m. when he looked up and noticed a large, brightly lighted object in the sky. He called his wife to come and look at it. The object was oval-shaped, very bright white in color, and appeared to be about 1,000 yards away. It hovered silently for about 15 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up out of sight. 

Mr. Hubert stated the object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air when he first saw it. He said the object did not make any sound and there was no exhaust or vapor trail. 

The witness was very impressed by the size and brightness of the object and his wife corroborated his story. They were both convinced they had seen some type of unidentified flying object.

This sighting was a relatively close encounter with a very bright, oblong-shaped object observed visually and through 7x50 binoculars for a duration of approximately 15 minutes.

It was described as being luminous, glowing white in color, about the size of a baseball held at arm's length, and elongated in shape. The sighting was investigated by two detectives from the Clearwater Police Department.

Dear Capt. Sturdy
My witness's statement contains the following details:
My witness was driving his automobile on a straight highway around 9:15 PM when he observed a strange rectangular object, flat on the bottom, convex on top, hovering over the highway about 50 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was not making any noise. The object moved slowly in a north-westerly direction for about 2 or 3 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. 
The witness was so impressed by the performance of the object that he called the local authorities at once to report the incident. 
This case is considered important by the project staff and deserves further investigation.
