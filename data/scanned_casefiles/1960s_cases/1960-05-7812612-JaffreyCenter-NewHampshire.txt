PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 20 May 60

2. LOCATION: Jaffrey Center, New Hampshire

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2005022 May 60
   Level: 0002
   GMT: 2005022 May 60

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Air-Visual

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. PHOTO: No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 min

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

9. COURSE: SW

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Very bright and deep gold, about 3 times as large as a planet, size similar to the sun seen high through thick cloud. Clear-cut circle or disc. Motion was plainly visible as it crossed a window approx 5 ft x 3 ft high diagonally from top to bottom. Appeared E of S, high in sky. Disappeared W of S, low in sky, seemed to be descending.

11. COMMENTS:
The investigator believed that the object of this sighting was probably a reflection, however there is no sufficient data to support this claim. If the object had been a balloon it probably would not have crossed the area covered by the window so quickly and as a/c would probably have crossed much faster. This case contains insufficient data to reach a conclusion.

12. CONCLUSIONS: (All boxes are unchecked)

Evaluation of Source Reliability UNKNOWN

Analysis and Conclusions: IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS MERELY A REFLECTION, HOWEVER SOME OF THIS CLAIM CANNOT BE SUBSTANTIATED. IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE OBJECT HAD BEEN A BALLOON. IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE CROSSED THE AREA COVERED BY THE WINDOW SO QUICKLY AND NO CORRELATION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CAUSED MUCH FURTHER INTEREST. THIS CALL CONTAINS INSUFFICIENT DATA TO REPORT A CONCLUSION.
