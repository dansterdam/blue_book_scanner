Dear Sir,

This is to notify you of the observation of a UFO incident that occurred in the Roxbury, New York area on July 9, 1964. The estimated distance of the object from the observer was 200-225 yards, and it was observed for approximately 5 minutes. The object was described as a brilliant incandescent sphere, estimated to be 30 to 35 feet in diameter, hovering about 75 feet above the ground. It was then seen to ascend rapidly and disappear from view.

Clark was about a 5-6 man car on return. Gave a strong orange glow and appeared smooth and glassy. It went southeast about 15 seconds and disappeared at about 30 degrees elevation.

It was spherical in shape and about 30 feet in diameter. There was no sound. It had an orange glow.
