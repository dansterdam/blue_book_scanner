Here is the text I can read from the document:

Rec 22 Sept 66
From Div 16

L. Citizen & wife
to weather observation, lightning south,
west strown, darkness, 6:00 P.I.

[The rest of the text is partially legible, with some words and phrases discernible but not completely clear. Some parts of the text are difficult to read with full confidence.]

The document appears to be a handwritten report, with some header information and a description of an observation, but the full details are not entirely clear due to the handwriting and image quality.

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

There is a large black redaction bar in the middle of the document, and some words are partially illegible or difficult to read with complete certainty.

SIGHTING NOT SUBSTANTIATED BY OTHER REPORTS OR DATA
FROM NORAD COC, SPADATS, FAA CENTER AND CONTROL TOWERS
AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, HOWEVER NEGATIVE
REPORTS FROM THESE AGENCIES PRACTICALLY ELIMINATE
POSSIBILITY OF OBJECT BEING AN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITE,
