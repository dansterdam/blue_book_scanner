The object did not move in a southerly direction along time but moved up, down & north.
The first sighting was over Minerva and got a very vivid description of it as aimed to follow us. Disappeared behind horizon after stopped at someone's home. I waited for 5 min until it disappeared behind horizon.

3rd. I was with my girl friend & she got pretty upset after people have been talking about sighting during this past week so I thought I'd better report about 20-25 people have seen - something.
