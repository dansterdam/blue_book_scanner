34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   3    March    1967
    Day            Month       Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

An object similar to the one described in this questionnaire was sighted between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m., EST, traveling from west to east over the east end of Frankfort, Kentucky, at a speed estimated by my husband to be 600 mph and an altitude (also estimated by husband) of 2,000 - 3,000 feet. We were in an automobile, and husband first saw it about 10 miles - more than 10 seconds. However, it struck me as so similar, except that it consisted of three very bright yellow lights flying altitudinally but in a reasonable sequence. I can give no other details except that it appeared to me to be closer than my husband estimated (I would guess between 1,000 and 1,500 feet), and was moving very rapidly.

Dear Mr [redacted]

Your letter of January 26, 1967 concerning several unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings by your husband and other individuals was referred to this office for reply.

Our office has received several reports of a blue-green cloud on the morning of January 15, 1967. These other reports were from Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. A detailed investigation into the matter revealed that Eglin Air Force Base, Florida was engaged in an upper atmosphere research study at the time of the sightings. A two stage Nike-Iroquois rocket which contained a vaporized barium payload was launched at approximately 5:43 a.m. CST January 16. At an altitude of approximately 100 miles, the barium payload was ejected. This produced an enormous green vapor cloud which was visible for several hundred miles. The Eglin Information Office has informed our office that this cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field and was visible for approximately 30 minutes.

The description in the news clipping you provided is quite similar to those we were already received concerning the January 15 early morning observation. Upper atmospheric research studies this past year have been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

As for the other sightings, I can offer no comments without additional information. If you and your husband would complete the enclosed UFO Form 164 on your successive UFO observations, an evaluation will be attempted.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Gentlemen:

On the evening of January 18, 1967, I telephoned your office regarding several 50 sightings by my husband, a friend, and me. In the verbal report, I mentioned that I had observed strange-looking objects on three successive nights (January 16-18) and that the one I came closest to was near the community utilities power plant, located between Lawrenceburg and Frankfort.

Because of my curiosity about the object's proximity to the power plant, I have since returned to the area of the sighting and discovered that the power lines running was located exactly one-tenth of a mile from the power lines which cross over the highway at that point.

You will notice in the clipping I am enclosing (from the January 26, 1967, Frankfort State Journal) that all witnesses, excluding the report of an object near the Shewfelt substation prior to the power failure there, noticed the objects they saw as moving in the direction of Lawrenceburg.

You will notice, too, that one witness described the object she saw as looking to be "about the size of one of those big water towers". In my report, I used same analogy to describe the object I watched near the DP plant on January 18.

Several other reports, similar to the ones I am enclosing, have come to my attention during the past week, and one of those reports is similar to the one I am preparing to send you. The person described the object he saw to me as similar to "a bluish-green cloud with three tips". This was seen in Scott County on January 15 at 7 a.m., and it was in the sky in the direction of Lawrenceburg.

The similarity of all of these accounts is striking, I think, and I felt that you would receive this additional information. Perhaps it will be of some help in the study being made concerning UFOs.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching? If so, how?
It suddenly sped off, climbing gradually but rapidly, until it was beyond our visual range.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - no sound at all.
b. Color - The only visible part consisted of two red and two yellow lights.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and not how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The head of a match would have easily obscured each individual light. Then assuming an outline from the arrangement of lights, the object appeared to be the size of a compact car.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:     3     March     1967
                                        Day     Month     Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

My husband and I were in the area of the sighting described herein as a result of an incident which occurred the previous evening, when a friend and I watched some unusual-acting lights for almost three hours. (That report was filled by me by telephone, January 18, 1967.) Upon studying detailed maps of the county in which we were located and also the county line near the strange lights, we were able to approximate the location, near the point from which my friend and I had viewed the lights, we also observed subsequently that the red light on the Fox Creek Rural Electric Cooperative tower is visible (a distance of approximately ten miles), which gave us a good idea as to the location of the erratic lights we had seen.

For this reason, my husband and I drove to that area. It was at this time that we were armed to see not only the light on the tower but the peculiar arrangement of lights described in this report.

These lights were above the treetops 100 yards or so from the highway. Upon seeing them, my husband slowed the car. I rolled down the window to get a better look and to see if there was any noise. Proceeding past the object, we pulled into a driveway or some type of road to turn around and go back to the object so that we would be on the same side of the road as it was. While waiting for an on-coming car to pass, we could pull onto the highway again, the object suddenly sped off, ascending gradually and moving out of sight within 5 seconds or so. Just before it went out of sight, I noticed that the few lights now appeared to be arranged almost in a straight line rather than two under the other two as they were when we first watched it. The one red light was still blinking furiously.

I might add that had we not known the area and had we not been looking for some prior night's sighting, the object would most probably not have been perceived. Our attention, as I did not move at all until we were waiting for the other car to pass could go back for another look.
