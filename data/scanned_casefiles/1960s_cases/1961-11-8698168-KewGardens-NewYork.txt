16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound NONE
b. Color THE OBJECT CHANGED FROM BLUE TO RED AND RED DARK TO BLUE AS IT BEGAN TO MOVE ITS BRIGHTER WHITE LIGHTS LIST FADED.
17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch of an object with annotations including "NORTH EAST", "WHITE BRIGHT", "OBLIQUE SHAPE", "WHITE BUT BRIGHTER THAN THE REST OF THE OBJECT"]

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

e. Other: IT WAS SHARP OUTLINED AND CHANGED FUZZY AS IT MOVED.

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[A hand-drawn diagram showing an object moving from North East to East]

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? I DON'T KNOW.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? I DON'T KNOW.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching? If so, how? IT STARTED TO DISAPPEAR AS IF IT WAS SLOWLY MOVING INTO ANOTHER DIRECTION IT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I NEVER SAW AN OBJECT LIKE THAT BEFORE AND I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER OBJECT THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME APPEARANCE.

Dear Sir,

On Nov. 26, 1961, at 11 o'clock PM I worked out the window and saw an object in the sky, white with two bright lights and went to my wife & telescope (UOVO) to get a better look. The object changed color from white to red to a size like a star to seem stationary in the sky. Then it started to move very slowly sideways from the last Q side was that I saw it.

I am two witnesses who say I saw it and I am investigating chemical sidelight out
