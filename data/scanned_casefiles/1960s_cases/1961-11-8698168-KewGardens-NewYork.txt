The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing questions and text fields for the observer to fill out.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? I COULD T.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? K NO.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? I STANTLY TO
DISAPPEAR APPEAR AND REAPPEAR VERY RAPIDLY AND DID NOT NOTICE
ALTITUDE CHANGE OR DIRECTION OF FLIGHT.

24. In order that you can give a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words some common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. 
A SPHERE ABOUT 20 FEET IN DIAMETER THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME
APPEARANCE.

This image contains two sketches, but no photograph. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above it marked with an "A" to illustrate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene, with a person silhouetted in the foreground and a mountainous horizon in the background, as well as a smaller inset sketch showing a different landscape perspective.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Dear Sir,
Nov. 26, 1961
I received a report on Nov. 25, 1961 at 11:20 p.m. from a resident of Kew Gardens, New York. He stated that on that date at approximately 11:10 p.m. he observed a bright light in the sky which moved rapidly for a few seconds, then remained stationary for about 2 minutes. The light then disappeared. The observer said the object was round and emitted a white light which was brighter than the surrounding stars. No sound was heard. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds.
