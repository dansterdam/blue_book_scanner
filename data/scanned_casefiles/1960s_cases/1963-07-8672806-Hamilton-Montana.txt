Dear Sirs:

I am inquiring into what I viewed at 9:35P.M. on the evening of the 4th of July. A friend and myself were watching a fireworks display with binoculars from a distance. When they were completed I asked him if he had ever looked at the moon through binoculars and he said that he hadn't. He was quite surprised to see the moon jump up as close as it did with 7 x 50 binoculars. Be then asked me how the stars looked with them, as I had the glasses again at that time, and I said I'doubt if it made them any more than just brighter. I picked out what I thought was the brightest star at random and viewed it through the binoculars. I thought my eyes were deceiving me, but after close observation, the star that I had picked out was moving steadily across the sky. He watched and said yes, that it was moving and I could then make it out with my naked eye. It was on a approximate 450 tangent in relation to the horizon and moving from West to East in the Southern hemisphere. It looked exactly like the the nation that in an earlier year reflected light back to earth. I had heard not mention of this in the radio or read of it in the paper, so I would be interested in knowing what this object was, that is if you don't mind going to the trouble of checking back. I thought that this was pure luck the way that I happened to spot it in the first place. Curiosity has nagged at me until I had to write this letter and find out what it was I was looking at. Thank you very much for the trouble it might take you to find this information out for me.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature area blacked out]
