Sighted object in the west at approximately 35 deg above horizon. Object was clear shaped and not very bright, its color was alive. Seemed to appear and disappear twice. Observed, assumed the object was going up because it appeared to be getting smaller. The moon was in the same position as the object and would be visible in the daylight. Also it would appear to be just as the object was described. Clear shaped since it is in its last quarter. As the sun rises higher in the sky the moon would appear to dim to the point where it would no longer be visible.

At all, it was like a long silver bar could this have been an U.F.O. and can they stand still in the sky and should it have called you immediately. Then I saw this object?

I feel so partly about this. I was that 3Â½ miles north of Greenville on state route 49, and this object was in the sky. West of us and not very high up.

I feel as much better that I have told you this so I am very sincere about it, and sorry I didn't write at once.

Thanking you so much for sending the letter.

Sincerely,

Greenville, Ohio 45331.

March 23, 1966.

Dear Sir:

Please forgive me on the liberty from taking up writing you but this has been on my mind for at least a month. I feel I should tell you of the object I saw in the sky.

It was a beautiful long-slender looking bar, not very wide. I saw it from my kitchen window, and could see in the sky as I went out side, + there at first so beautiful, it made me afraid. I kept watching it, and finally like so well covered it at disappeared. It did this three times, the last time, it must have went on up out of sight - so it didn't go forward or backward.

This happened in the morning just before 10:00 clock. Now I know this time, I had the Back to the Bible Broadcast on radio, it comes on from 9:30 to 10:00 o'clock. It was during the week in February 15th 16th.

I was out of time, but to explain in the sky, they claim they can see a shape, but this wasn't to a shape.
