November 14, 1961

This is in response to your letter of October 17 in which you describe observations of an unidentified flying object near Duluth, Minnesota.

As you may know, a number of similar observations have been receiving attention from the United States Air Force through Project Blue Book. The Air Force has concluded that most of these sightings can be explained as natural phenomena.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has asked the Air Force to study this matter further. Your interest in reporting your observation is appreciated.

Very truly yours,

Gerhard W. Tückmantel
James E. McDonald, Executive Secretary
Investigations and Observations Branch

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn illustration and accompanying text describing an observation of unidentified objects viewed in the sky on October 11, 1961 in Duluth, Minnesota. The illustration depicts two circular objects labeled A and D, with additional shapes labeled B and C. The text provides details about the observed objects, including their appearance, movement, and relative size.

Objects viewed in the sky on October 11, 1961 at 7:45 pm in Duluth, Minnesota.

This has been drawn diagonally to get them on the page. They first appeared like spheres and then they were like this for 15-20 seconds. After that they appeared like spheres again.

Sphere A was 15-20 times larger than Sphere D, and when they were directly overhead, B and C were the same size then.

D seemed to be ducts.
Sky was visible at points marked x.
This approximately shows the proportion of the A to B projection.
