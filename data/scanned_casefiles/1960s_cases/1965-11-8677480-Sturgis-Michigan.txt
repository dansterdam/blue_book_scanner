Mr USAF SAYCIOC (Mr Hunt) 

We have received a report from Dr and Mrs. RUSSELL BRIGHT, 24 Larch Drive, Sturgis, Michigan that they believe they have observed a celestial object which has been determined to be the planet VENUS in the reported position of this object for the past month. However, they inform that the appearance of astronomical bodies are frequently distorted by atmospheric conditions such as inversions or haze.

1. Description of the Object:
a. Circular in shape.
b. Approximately one-hundred feet in diameter.
c. The object was a first green illuminated with a dim green and darning light.
d. There was one object only.
e. The object was first sighted with an intense greenish light, similar to the light of a mercury arc lamp. This area lighted was about thirty-five percent of the total area. The remaining portion of the object was not illuminated but in a sense viewed as though it was transparent. In these viewings this light has reappeared.
f. There was no trail, exhaust or visible.
g. There was no audible sound.

2. Description of Course or Conduct:
a. The observer walked to the window to look out and he noticed the object.
b. The azimuth and elevation of the object at first observation was two miles south-southeast and about one thousand feet in elevation.
c. The azimuth and elevation of the object at disappearance was two miles east-southeast and about two thousand feet in elevation.
d. On first observation the object hovered, slowly descending and made one very rapid tilting movement to the west, about one thousand feet.
e. The bottom light began to descend. The upper light remained steadily but the bottom light fluctuated rapidly, indicating a rotation of the object, though there were no external appendages visually observed.
f. On a subsequent viewing the object hovered about the same station and remained in this position for at least five minutes. On more recent viewings the object seemed higher but maintained the same course, of course.
g. The bottom light is no longer visible.
h. The object descended down to just above the horizon and shot off to the northeast at high speed and was no longer visible.
i. The object was originally visible for approximately five minutes but has been viewed for up to an hour.

8. Position Titles and Comments of the Preparing Officer:
a. For Position and Remarks of Preparing Officer:
General Manager of the Sturgis Chemical Company, Division of Runer Industries, states: This job obviously requires vast technical knowledge despite the fact that he has no more than a high school education. After seeing this object on several occasions I feel confident that there is nothing about it that would identify it as being a known celestial object. I feel confident that the object is something strange and I have been unable to obtain any further information on the position or identity of this object.
