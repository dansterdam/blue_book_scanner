There was no radar contact or known air traffic in the area at that time. The object was first sighted and its distance away examined for over 3 minutes. However, a definite size appreciation cannot be obtained due to the lack of known points for comparison. No sound was heard nor physical evidence left. Briefly summarized, the phenomenon was about 3 ft in diameter and about 200 ft away when first sighted. The object's speed was estimated by the observers at 1/4 to 1/100 of a second. However, there is some question in the minds of the observers as to the accuracy of this estimate because the object displayed a pulsating or fluttering motion reminiscent of auto headlight reflections.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers stated that they sighted and photographed a luminous object which they estimated to be about 3 ft in diameter and 200 ft away when first sighted. The phenomenon was about 3 ft in diameter and about 200 ft away when first sighted. The object's speed was estimated by the observers at 1/4 to 1/100 of a second.

While at the station, Lt. Anderson asked me to watch by the desk while he was busy on the phone. During this time a couple came in and reported a sighting of a bright light. The man said he was parked south on 26th street and saw a bright light pass over the house across the street to the north, and then come back by again. The light seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet off the ground. The witness seemed very sincere, and said they had never seen anything like it before. They gave the following account of the incident:
They were in their car and were parked on 26th street. They first noticed the light coming from the southwest and passing over the house across the street to the northeast of them. They were sure it was not a plane or helicopter, but rather a round, bright white light. After passing over the house, it turned and came back again. They watched it for a couple of minutes. They said the light was about 40 to 50 feet off the ground, and that it seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. It was a very bright white light, not blinking. They said it did not make any sound. After watching it for a couple of minutes, it suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed in a southwesterly direction and disappeared from sight.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF OFFENSE, PROGRESS OF INVESTIGATION, ETC.

The two boys stated they both seen a reddish bright object in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be a distance. The object came up first at about a 30 degree angle and then after it got up a ways, it went to the north northwest and came down again at a very low altitude. It hovered for a short while and then zigzagged up higher and higher until it disappeared. This is shown in the two pictures. They were asked as to the color of the object and they stated it was reddish or orange in color. There was no blue light, no green light. There was no other color lights to the object except natural bright red.

We went out to the location and the subject showed us where they were when they saw this object. It was about 3/4 of a mile from the boys location where the object first appeared and where it came down at a low altitude. The ground in the area where there was some of the plowed ground sticking out and small snow drifts as all covered with icy frost.

Colonel Jackson, Commander of the 119th Combat Support Group at Hector Airport was called and he stated that he would contact Grand Forks Air Force Base and see if the Air Defense Command would be notified to see if the object could be identified. No further information is available at this time.

2-26-67 - Went the area where the object was supposedly located and could not find any indication of where an object may have landed or been close to the ground. Mark Arndt came and looked at the area but found nothing.

PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-88, submitted by Major Ulmaniec-Czarniak, regarding photo analysis of photographs taken of a UFO in the vicinity of Fargo, North Dakota.
ANALYSIS: The "unidentified object" appears on each of the referenced photographs. On the first exposure the image appears as a white light, near circular in shape, with a star-like emanation from the base. No other details are discernible. On the second exposure the image is slightly larger and more distinct. However, there are no additional details observable. The source's estimates of size (five feet in diameter) and distance (approximately 200 feet) are considered the photographic evidence, however, as no scale or reference points are available, the exact size and distance cannot be ascertained due to the lack of necessary detail for such calculations.

However, this traveling on the highway in the background and as much the photos would indicate likely that the answer to the question is 1/15 of a second. It appears to be related to some sighting of an object. The temperature was reportedly high and the object was bright; it was observed for a short time. If the sighting is not a hoax, the stimulus could possibly have been a plasma of some type.

Reference: Sighting of 23 February 1967 at Fargo, N. D. See Report of 16 March 1967 from Grand Forks AFB, N. D.

On November 14, 1967 I interviewed the two boys concerned in the sighting of 23 February 1967 at breakfast. M--, a student, and the other observer object some - who along with M-- saw the object. 

I was favorably impressed by the boys, who told their story in a straightforward manner. Afterwards, and before dark, I was taken to the site of the sighting, where we found no traces or indications that anything unusual had taken place. 

No color photographs were taken at the time, but I will be furnished if requested.

The boys had been in West Fargo earlier for the purpose, among other things, of answering any questions I might have as to how it happened that they had a Polaroid camera (as reported) and hand why it was that they had it with them that cold February evening. They reported that they were about to turn along the frontage road to a house which they wished to photograph when the object turned and then came towards them, at which time one of them took a picture. They observed the object for a short interval and then said, "Hey, what's that light over there?" to his companion. It was hovering over the ground and seemingly not far away.

- page 24 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text only.

Transcription of the text:

"any case, between them and the town. The boys described how they got the car off to the side of the road as soon as possible. How they had run to the sheriff's office and told of the incident. The deputy sheriff was notified and he went directly to the scene, but by the time he got there, the object had disappeared.

As described by him, in his excitement, he pulled his pistol and fired several shots at the bright glowing object, but it disappeared from sight before he could get a good aim at it. The glowing object was much higher in the sky and presumably farther away.

I think one of the remarkable things about the boys themselves is that they admitted freely to the incident and it is unlikely that on a cold February night, a hoax would have been perpetuated by them. Lions would not have been playing a trick. They have no reputation for such things, and the report first went to the police station, which still leaves the possibility of a hoax doubtful. There was no particularly rough terrain around, and the flight of the object seemed to the boys to be approximately 50 miles away.

Note is made of the statement that a deep inversion existed - this was below freezing, so well above freezing. It is estimated that the object was at approximately 3000 feet. The object emitted a bright glow and apparently was reflecting the strong moonlight at the time.

The interrogation of the boys was good as far as it went, but the local UFO officer should have had the boys accompanied by someone at night, at the same spot, and he himself, using the same camera, should have taken photographs under the same conditions. The exposure time could thus have been verified. The ASA rating of the film was stated to be 400 and may have been too fast to obtain the sharpness that was desired. I believe an effort to obtain the town lights would have been worthwhile.

The long streak at the bottom of the photograph apparently indicates that the object was reflecting light."

Request for UFO Information

1. It could be a hoax: 
Lyvern College Observatory
60 Martin Street
Cambrige, Massachusetts 02139

2. Reference your letter of 15 July 1963. Please excuse the delay in reply.

3. We have forwarded a copy of the 3 February 1967 listing from our project Blue Book files. This also includes material received since the date. 

4. Inclosures: In view of our evaluation card for a sighting from Blachly, Alaska, where one of the four observers were aircraft personnel, we think the "report" was slight to suspect.

6. We also have a very interesting case for the late evening of 25 Sept. 1956. The observers (apparently were very capable and reliable people) sighted a large delta-wing aircraft hovering and then silently disappearing. They left no doubt of their conviction that the object was not an aircraft. However, the object did not show on the moon but did see a star.

5. Incidentally, we do not know anything about the decay or any similar unusual case indians in late June or early July 1956. There was simply nothing to our knowledge that was unusual in our records for that period.

Dear Colonel:

Thank you for your letter of the 22nd of October regarding the UFO sighting. I simply cannot add to the information contained in my prior report. I simply cannot add to the information that I might take out of the more serious worries of the world. Seriously, the observation was made and reported, and I have no further supplementary information to add. I hope you can understand the dilemma.

I would, as a complete stranger, say that on the record, I would say that the time spent in looking for a confirmation or contradiction of the finding is less than a waste of time. Other fields of investigation will appear that the Air Force is not, now, considering as being so fruitful. I hope that one can see my position: I can offer nothing more definitive, and I am, as you know, in no position to assess the implication of the incident. One can only speculate on what the answer will be. Incidentally, I was surprised to hear of the outcome of the meetings. I still was under the impression that no significance was attached to the affair as a whole.

I am sorry that I cannot provide any more assistance. But I was busy myself on the weekends of 11 October and therefore deserved, but far too restrained.

The investigation of UFO reports at Harvard is undertaken cautiously and with full respect for the difficulty of the field. But I was busy myself on the weekends of 11 October and therefore deserved, but far too restrained. Following that, I spent the week in Colorado.

I was most interested in the Condon investigation report. It is almost certainly so. Elmo's fire, as you surmised.

The text of the document is as follows:

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla -2- October 26, 1968

With reference to the 25 February 1967 sighting at Fargo, N.D., which was made the subject of Project Blue Book's investigation, I put the "object" seen in the northwest was almost certainly the Planet Venus. 

On 2 March 1967, "Venus" at magnitude -3.4, is striking in the evening sky, for it sets well after dark. I noticed the chances of color were the same as that mystery object, and I don't believe that there is anything else that could have been the same thing, but made an error in their determination of direction. That is very easy to do, especially if the mind is working.

I am not very much impressed with Rynick's investigation of the phenomenon. The makes the basic assumption, which I believe is a serious defect of many such investigations, that the two separate objects then it was the same one, beyond question. The boys might have seen something different.

There are lots of questions that I could ask, which apparently were not touched on, or if they were, the results did not measure up to the standards I believe should be required. But when one is taking such pictures of small bright objects in the night sky, control does not function satisfactorily, nor are the spots on the pictures as sharp as I would judge they should be against the background. I would judge that they were not of high quality and therefore the significance of the pictures has to be taken carefully. How can one minimize the effect of controlling the apparatus when making a fairly long exposure? There was nothing in the record to indicate that the object photographed was the same object seen.

No, in regard to the case of 14 August 1968. After reading the report, I am completely convinced they were seeing the moon. It has happened before when a person says, "I know what I saw", and it turns out to almost always be "the moon." This would not be the first time that people have called the moon a UFO. I think they should take the statements of the witnesses at their face value. Under such circumstances, I subscribe to the motto that "People are Dumb!"

I would also concur with the identification of the [REDACTED] sighting of 11 July 1968 as the moon.
I had some interesting discussions with [REDACTED], the Dutch astronomer, who was the chief individual working with me in naming certain more or less conventional objects as "Open Air." Are you familiar with it? If not, you certainly should be, because it develops every phenomenon of meteorological origin, if you desire to get one.

He told me that he had discovered a number of extremely reliable observations of multiple images of the sun or moon, which in terms of instrumentation are no simple explanation for these phenomena. But he was quite sure that something peculiar is the degree of instrumentation, possibly in proportion.

Sometimes I get discouraged at the situation. I have worked pretty hard, as you know to some extent, into this area: I know of no possible exception of Hytek. But something definitely has happened to some individuals, but as part of a broad pattern. Apparently he feels that much more could be learned if conditions were generally more edifying, since he keeps his findings, as yet, quite tightly to himself, probably for fear of adverse reactions and attacks, to keeping files and dealing with cases solely on an individual basis. This is rather strange inasmuch as knowledge, like a lone duck in a shooting gallery, can nearly always be shot down by an ad hoc, frequently contrived explanation.

I don't mind his reference to me in this fashion. In fact, I consider it a compliment. But it shows him somewhat over-cautious, I think, and on its own merits. For there are now published investigations and on its own merits. For there are now published investigations and observations on UFOS enough by Hynek and others to clearly establish their reality. People can solve their own problems, but you cannot solve them if you take them in a group. But why should my individual's attention be diverted from an important, simply because they may not always dispose to data in keeping, independent sighting? Frankly, I feel much more confident in my recognition of UFOS nature by Hynek and others, who have to deal with them professionally, than in mine.

With thanks and best wishes, I am Sincerely yours,
Donald H. Menzel

Attn: 	TDPT (UFO)

Reference:	Your letter of 14 February
To:	Lt. Col. Rector Quintanilla

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases you requested. I believe these cards are unduly brief. My notation on my copy of the case calls for additional investigation of my opinion that the four cases represent only a single case.

2. I regret also, from your standpoint, that all four cases must in my opinion be classified as "unknown".

3. I would rate the 12 July 1968, Omaha, Nebraska, case as the weakest in this category, and the ones of Gerlach, Wisconsin, the strongest. I obtained a good tape recording in the Omaha case, and will send you a copy of the classification of the witnesses as part of my summary. Except for one or two points, particularly the matter of the sighting possibly being caused by the ejection of a seaplane, I would hold that transponders show a good case.

k. Comments of the preparing officers:
(1) The two boys who reported sighting the UFO appeared to be reliable. Their estimates of the distance from the object (approximately 2000') and its size (approximately 200') are inconsistent with the evidence of the photographs. I talked with the lieutenant and they have to offer is incorporated in this report. The two boys, of course, have no scientific background.
(2) An inspection of the scene of the sighting indicated that the surface below the approximate point of the first sighting did not reveal any burns or disturbance of any kind. Generally, the ground was dry and snow covered, with substantial areas of plowed and frozen earth exposed. No craters or depressions of any kind were located, nor was there any evidence on the map. The most noticeable characteristics of the field were the telephone and high tension wires surrounding it. (See attached map.)
(3) We have no information that any aerial test, experimental aircraft, rocket, or missile was near Fargo at the time of the sighting.
(4) Although our information indicates that no aircraft account for this sighting, I feel it should be noted that Hector Airport line approximately due north of this field, and it is quite possible that the photographs were taken in that direction as conventional air traffic approached or departed from the airport.
(5) Also enclosed is a Fargo Police Department Report, which reached this office 15 Mar 67, concerning an object sighted on the same date, 25 Feb 67, at 6:55 p.m.

Air Force Checking:
2 Fargo Youths Take
Photos Of 'Object'
FARGO, N.D. -  A mysterious photo of an unidentified flying object was taken Sunday night by two Fargo youths, and the Air Force is investigating. 
The youths, who were identified only as juvenile males, said they saw the object while traveling in a car on North University Drive. They stopped the car, took two pictures, and then drove off, afraid to get a closer look.
The boys, both about 17 years old, said the object was bright reddish-orange and appeared to be suspended in the air. They said it hovered for a short time, then disappeared.
The Air Force has the two photos and is checking into the incident, but a spokesman said no further information would be available until the investigation is completed.
The boys said they were afraid to get closer to the object and reported the incident to the Air Force office here Tuesday.
