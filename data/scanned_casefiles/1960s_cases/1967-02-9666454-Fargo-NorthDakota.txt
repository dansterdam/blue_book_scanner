There was no radar contact or known air traffic in the area at that time. The sources estimate of the and distance are consistent with the photographic evidence, however, a definite size appreciation cannot be obtained due to the lack of necessary detail for obtaining a scale factor.

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
2 - 4 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
NE

8. PHOTOS
Yes

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Yes

SUMMARY
The observers stated that they sighted and photographed a luminescence "blob" that rose from the ground and accelerated away in a northerly direction. The phenomenon was about 5 ft in diameter and about 200 ft away which they first sighted at 1.5.

COMMENTS CONTD: Shutter speed was estimated by the observers as 1/15 and 1/100 of a second. However there is some question as to the nature of the streak of light at the bottom of the first photo. Dr. Hynek feels that it could have been the result of other aerial light on photographic film, possibly reflecting an embankment.

While at the station, Lt. Anderson asked me to watch by the desk while he was busy on the phone. Two parties came into the station and stated that they had a couple of pictures that they wanted to show. The two were Ardent Lee, age 16, of 646 and 8th, Fargo, N. Dak., and Steve Wray, age 18 of 1046 and 8th, Fargo, N. Dak. These two boys showed me a couple of pictures that they had taken. They gave the following account of the incident:

They went to west Fargo and on the way back, they turned off of I-94 onto the intersection of I-29. They then took the frontage road along side of I-94 to 26th Street. They told me they were just to the south side of I-94 at 26th St. where they were just to the bright of the light. They went to the north of the I-94 overpass and pulled across the Polaroid camera out of the trunk of the car and ran a little further and just about to the Milwaukee RR tracks and the object started to light up from the ground. A little too soon and then took another right away. This picture is attached as picture #1. Another picture is attached as picture #2. I pulled out another picture and the object was quite some distance away. This picture is attached as picture #2. See Supt.

OFFENSE: UFO
COMPLAINANT: [Redacted]
ADDRESS: Fargo, N. Dak.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF OFFENSE, PROGRESS OF INVESTIGATION, ETC.

The two boys stated that the object took off in a northeasterly direction. It was going up (first at about 150 degrees) and then after it got up a way, it went to the north in easterly direction. They stated that the object went out of sight quite fast. It did not appear as the UFO went real fast but as it got up a little higher it kept on getting smaller and smaller quite fast. This is shown in the two pictures. They were asked as to why big the object might be and they stated it looked an the two pictures approximately 3 to 5 feet in diameter, was somewhat of a disc shape, quite round and was all lit up with a plain white light. The whole object was lit.

We went out to the location and the subject showed me where they were when they saw this object. We checked out in the field to the east of 25th St. and south of the Milwaukee RR tracks. While some area was checked but to no avail, as it was quite hard to see in the area as there was some of the plowed ground sticking out and small snow drifts, all around.

Colonel Johnson, Commander of the 119th Combat Support Group at Hector Airport was called and he stated that he would contact Grand Forks Air Force Base would be called to see if the Air Force would like to check on this incident. See Suppl. by M. Anderson reference the call back from Grand Forks Air Force Base.

2-26-67 Checked the area where the object was supposedly located and could not find any sign of where an object may have landed or been close to the ground. Mark Arndt came and checked also and Officer C.M.K.

P NRS 2 original prints (B&W)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-58, submitted by Major Quintanilla TEST/UF, requesting photo analysis be accomplished on two photographs of an "unidentified object" to determine what the object may be. The photographs were taken in the vicinity of Fargo, North Dakota.

2. ANALYSIS: The "unidentified object" appears on each of the referenced photographs. On the first exposure the image appears as a white light, near circular in shape, with a short trace or trail. On the first exposure light emitting from its base. No other details are discernible. On the second exposure, the image appears only as a small white light again, and there are no details discernible. The source's estimates of size (five feet in diameter) and distance (approximately 200 feet) are consistent with the photographic evidence, however, a definitive size appreciation cannot be obtained due to the lack of necessary detail for obtaining a scale factor. Although the photography appears to be authentic, the "object" could not be identified from the available evidence.

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 25 February 1967 and subsequent photographs.

2. Your photographs were submitted to photo experts for their evaluation. Although your photographs possess no image, a definite identification is not possible since only a bright light is visible. In such cases the image appears as a white light, more circular in shape. Other than the light, there are no discernible features.

3. Before making our final conclusions, we would appreciate additional information concerning the weather conditions.

    a. Were there many clouds in the area of the sighting?

    b. Were any stars or the moon visible at anytime during the sighting?

    c. Did the object move in front or in back of a cloud at anytime?

4. This additional information would be quite helpful in our final analysis.

5. Inclosed are your original photographs. Upon completion of analysis, we will advise you of our findings.

1. We thought that the enclosed sighting from Fargo, North Dakota on 5 February 1967 might be of interest to you since it isn't the usual run of the mill sightings that we normally receive.

2. We requested additional data from the witnesses on 3 July. Since they have not responded to date, we are again requesting additional data from them, including an AF Form 117. If this information is received we will forward it to you. Also, we have not included copies of the photographs. We hope to have additional prints in the near future and will forward them to you at that time.

however, this analyst feels that it is more likely the result of the headlights of an auto that was traveling on the highway in the background and in some such the photos would represent time exposure in which the shutter was open considerably longer than the reported 1/15 of a second. The second analysis from 50 miles away is probably of the planet Venus was twice requested from the Fargo Observatory but failed to respond as of 7 Mar 69. There was a temperature inversion that night, surgace winds were from 150 deg at 20 knots. A light snow was reported in scattered locations. There are a large number of telephone and high tension wire in the area of the sightings. It is felt that if the sighting is not a hoax, the stimulus could possible have been a plasma of some type.

Reference: Sightings of 25 February 1967 at Fargo, N. D. See Report of 16 March 1967 from Grand Forks AFB, N. D.

On November 14, 1967 I interviewed the two boys concerned in the sighting of 25 February 1967 and on the following morning I interviewed his wife, who along with his wife reportedly saw the same or similar object some ½ hour earlier, approximately 50 miles to the Northeast.

I was favorably impressed by the boys, who told their story in a very straightforward manner, but not at all as though it had been memorized. Afterwards, and before dark, I was taken by local newsmen to the locale of the sighting, and I was able to re-enact the circumstances of the sighting and will be furnished if requested.

No contradictions developed between the report originally submitted and the statements the boys made to me, but they were able to furnish additional details which follow.

The boys had been in West Fargo earlier for this, to take Polaroid pictures of the Beatles who were appearing on TV. This was in answer to my question of how it happened that they had a Polaroid camera so conveniently at hand when the incident occurred. The camera itself was in the trunk of the car. The object was turned as they were about to turn along the frontage road which one of the boys sighted just at first, and which then crosses Interstate 94, and which then crosses some RR tracks. One of the boys sighted it first, and told me he watched it for a short interval and then said, "Hey, what's that light over there?" to his companion. It was hovering over the ground and seemingly not far away--in

any case, between them and the town. The boys described how they got the car off to the side of the road as soon as possible, how one of them had run to the trunk and retrieved the camera as fast as possible; how he had run a short distance in front of the car and took his first photo. He described how, in his excitement, he pulled the Polaroid film out too far after waiting the prescribed 10 seconds, thus wasting the second film. After he had corrected that, he took a second picture; by this time the glowing object was much higher in the sky and presumably farther away because it decreased both in apparent size and brightness.

I think one of the remarkable things about the boys themselves is that upon reaching town they first reported the event to the police. In the highly improbable event that the sighting was a hoax perpetrated by them (it is unlikely that on a cold February night, a hoax would have been perpetrated, especially since the timing would be wrong-the boys were returning from another town) I is as unlikely that they would report first to a police station. This still leaves the possibility of a hoax done by others; the wind direction was approximately correct for a hot air balloon, but not only does the coldness of the night, and the roughness of the terrain argue against this (as does the sighting 50 miles away) but the light must have been quite intense to have produced so dense an image in a small fraction of a second.

Note is made of the statement that a deep inversion existed; this I believe is an error--a difference of from +11 deg. on the ground, to -47 at 5000 feet, or well above freezing, is a situation that cannot occur in reality. Perhaps it should have been +17 instead of -47. The actual weather record show no inversion at all.

The interrogation of the boys was good as far as it went, but the local UFO officer should have had the boys accompany him, at night, to the same spot, and he himself, using the same camera, should have taken several exposures, with the car headlights on, as I believe was the case, to see just how the distant lights showed up under test conditions. The exposure time could thus have been verified. The ASA rating of the film was stated to be 200; this is not fast and it may be that a test would have shown that a time exposure was necessary to obtain the town lights. The long streak of light at the bottom of the photograph apparently coincides with the road embankment, which apparently was reflecting light.

I would recommend that the local UFO officer be asked, even at this late date, to repeat the exposures to check on exposure time. Little can be done further to establish the reality, or unreality, of these photographs without such a test series of exposures, using the same camera,

and the same film. This exercise would have another spin off: further check could be made of the reliability of the boys under questioning after this much time has elapsed. If the Project so desires, I can make contact with the boys, and with the local officer, and ask that some exposure be made.

1. Reference your letter of 15 July 1963. Please excuse the delay in replying.

2. We have reproduced a copy of the 29 February 1967 sighting from Fargo, North Dakota, for you. A copy of the file was sent to you on 24 November 1967, however, the attached case notes include material received since the 24th.

3. Enclosed is a copy of our evaluation card for a sighting from Fargo, N.D., 15 Aug 63. Three of the Four Observers were aircraft controllers, and they all estimated that the "object" was eight to ten miles from them initially.

4. We also have a very interesting case for the late evening of 14 August 1963 or early morning hours of the 15th. The observers (apparently three very capable and reliable people) sighted a large terrain object that moved about in the sky, had a definite odor, and made a creaking noise. There was a strong inversion that night and the observers did not see the moon but did see stars. However, the moon should have been visible and in roughly the same position as the 1900. We have not evaluated this case yet because we are still trying to convince Dr Mynez that the moon may have been the culprit. We would appreciate your comments on this case.

5. Incidentally, we do not know anything about the decay of any terrain rocket body or its Indiana in late June or early July 1963. Also enclosed is a copy of a letter that we recently received from Point Fenwick, since it apparently involves a close fly, we thought that you might be interested.

Dear Hector:

Thank you for all of the interesting data you sent. I had seen the Condon article. I simply cannot understand Hyneck. I could support the idea of an international UFO project only on the idea that it might take our mind off of the more serious worries of the world. Scientifically, the idea is of course nonsense. I know not seen the notice in the Electronic News for September 30. I agree with you.

In 1969, am completely disgusted. Off the record, I would say that if I were in your shoes, I would terminate the consulting agreement forthwith. Otherwise, it will appear that the Air Force is now, through a special panel, endeavoring to pass judgment on the Condon Report. This would be completely untenable and embarrassing. One knows in advance from the personnel involved what the answer will be. Incidentally, I was in New York while the Astronomical Society was holding its meetings, and was surprised to hear of the UFO Panel being conducted there. I have no information, though, as to what transpired. Because I was busy otherwise, I think your censure of 11 October is certainly deserved, but far too restrained.

I apologize for not having replied earlier to your letter of 10 October and its interesting enclosures. But I was busy myself on a part of the International Astronomical Union, mainly crafting notes on the far side of the moon. Following that, I spent the week in Colorado.

I was very much interested in the Czechoslovakian report. It is almost certainly St. Elmo's fire as you surmised.

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla                -2-                October 28, 1968

With reference to the 25 February 1967 sighting at Fargo, N.D., I don't know what was "the boy's say." But the "object" seen by [redacted] in the northwest was almost certainly the Planet Venus.

I quote from 'Sky and Telescope' for March, 1967: "Venus, at magnitude -3.4, is striking in the evening sky. For it sets well after twilight ends." The changes of color and the rays are all consistent with the identification. I'd be inclined to think that probably the boys saw Venus.

I am not very much impressed with Hynck's investigation of the phenomenon. He makes the tacit assumption, which I believe is a serious defect of many such investigations, that the two separate groups saw the same "object." Well, if it was the same object, then it was the Planet Venus, beyond question. The boys might have seen something different.

There are lots of questions that I could ask, which apparently were not touched on. I'd like to know what the model of the Polaroid was. How did they determine the exposure time? Polaroid's have automatic controls for equalizing the exposure. But when one is taking the picture of a small bright object at night this control does not function satisfactorily. Are the spots on the picture stars? I would judge that they are not, because of their irregularity. I think pictures should have been taken under similar circumstances, to check the significance of the scratches seen at the edge of the film. How can one minimize the effect of camera warble for what must have been a fairly long exposure? There was nothing in the record to indicate that the object photographed was Venus. My point is not been a plane. The case is interesting, but the investigation leaves much to be desired.

No, in regard to the [redacted] case of 14 August 1968. After reading the record, I am completely convinced that when I passed the moon. It has been my experience that when a person says, in effect, "the sighting reminded me of...." but it could not have been ... because...." then it almost always is "...," since the "because" is invalid. This would not be the first time that people have called the moon a UFO. I think that many of the UFO investigations have failed because the investigators take the statements of the witnesses at their face value. Under such circumstances, I subscribe to the motto that "People are Dumb!"

Here is the text from the document:

I would also concur with the identification of the [redacted] sighting of 11 July 1968 as the moon.

I had some interesting discussions with [redacted], the Dutch Astronomer, who was the chief individual working with me in naming craters of the far side of the moon. He is the author of a delightful book, "The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air." Are you familiar with it? If not, you certainly should be, because it discusses many phenomena of meteorological optics. There is an inexpensive Dover edition, if you desire to get one.

He told me that he had discovered a number of extremely reliable observational multiple images of the sun on moon, which in terms of reflection go up to 3 1/2 degrees! There is no simple explanation for these phenomena, but he was quite sure that something peculiar in the way of meteorological optics is responsible.

Sometimes I get discouraged at the situation. I have worked pretty hard, as you know, to get some sense into this area. I know of no other scientist that has gone as deeply as I have into the matter, with the possible exception of Hynek. But sometimes definitely has happened to him and I don't know what it is. He now seems to regard the cases, not as individuals, but as part of a broad pattern. Apparently he feels you must solve the entire problem. In a letter to Condon he states: "Project Blue Book has limited itself, largely because of lack of funds and staff, to keeping files and dealing with cases solely on an individual basis. It is clear that each case, taken by itself, like a lone duck in a shooting gallery can nearly always be shot down by an ad hoc, frequently American approach."

I don't mind his reference to me in this fashion. In fact I consider it a striking of a compliment. But it shows his bias. I think each case has to be solved independently and on its own merits. For there are numbers of different kinds of stimuli, vastly completely unrelated. To me it sounds completely nonsensical to say that you can solve individual cases, but you cannot solve them if you take them in a group. But why should my individual solution of two or three cases, simply because they may not correspond to data in another, independent sighting. Frankly, I feel much of our present ignorance of UFO's must be laid at Hynek's door step, with his unimaginative approach to the subject. Lie, also, must take the blame for the fact that the Air Force questionnaire is so bad.

With thanks and best wishes, I am
Cordially yours,
Donald H. Menzel

k. Comments of the preparing officer:

(1) The two boys who reported sighting (the UFO) appeared to be reliable. Their estimates of their distance from the object (approximately 200') and its size (5') are internally consistent with the evidence of the photographs. I talked with both boys, and believe that all the information they have to offer has been incorporated in this report. The two boys, of course, have no scientific background.

(2) My inspection of the area of the sighting indicated that the surface below the approximate point of the first sighting did not reveal any burns or disturbance of any kind. Generally, the ground was partially snow covered, with substantial areas of plowed and frozen earth exposed. The object apparently first was seen over a concave section of the field shown on the map. The most noticeable characteristic of the field was the large number of telephone and high tension wires surrounding it. (See attached map.)

(3) We have no information that any aerial test, experimental aircraft, rocket, or missile was near Fargo at the time of the sighting.

(4) Although our information indicates that no aircraft could account for this sighting, I feel it should be noted that Hector Airport lies on a course approximately due north of the point at which the photographs were taken.

(5) Also enclosed is a Fargo Police Department Report, which reached this office 15 Mar 67, concerning an object sighted on the same evening, 25 Feb 67.

(6) Physical evidence report pursuant to paragraph 12, AFR 80-17.

(a) Photographic:

(1) Still photographs: Taken at 1950 local time 25 Feb 67, at the location of the sighting near Fargo, NDak approximately 46°51'10"N, 096° 49'00"W. (See attached two pictures and map.)
