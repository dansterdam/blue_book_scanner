I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low contrast, blurry document with extremely small text that is largely illegible. While there are rows and columns of text visible, I cannot confidently OCR the specific words or characters. The document seems to be a form or data sheet with multiple columns, but the details are not clear enough to accurately transcribe.
