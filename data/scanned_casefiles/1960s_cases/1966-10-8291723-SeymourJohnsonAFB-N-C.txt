16. Comments of Preparing Officer: I am unable to determine the source of the reported lights. There was no air traffic in the area and the RAPCON MPN 14 radar did not "paint" anything at all. The artillery range at Camp LeJeune, some 50 miles to the southeast of Seymour Johnson was being used only for small arms fire. There were two distinct flights of misratis these observed at approximately the same time as the reported lights. The airfield rotating beacon was on and rotating. There may be some remote possibility that the beacon reflected the flying geese or the scattered clouds in the area. The moon is not considered a factor as it was in phase Gibbous, declination 15° 4.7' S with a local hour angle of 54° 47.6'.
