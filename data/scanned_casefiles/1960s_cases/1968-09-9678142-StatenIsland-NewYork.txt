Dear Mr [redacted]

This replies to your letter of September 30, 1968, in which you reported that you had seen some unidentified flying objects (UFO's).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our medical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Such base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an in-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

Dear Sirs:

I saw four U.F.O. yesterday. It was a clear night, nothing much but the ships. It went straight across the sky at about 40 knots. The closest was about 1 mile away.

Yours Truly,

first four nil rest light white
