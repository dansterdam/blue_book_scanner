TRANSCRIPT:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Very, we used very to the instant.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - Like humming sound very unusual.
b. Color - bright light.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Part of one of the lights

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image does not contain a photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document, containing a sketch and instructions for the observer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 6? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I was awakened shortly after 10:30 P.M. on March 15, 1967 by a bright light shining through the bedroom window. I arose to investigate and observed a luminous disc shaped object hovering about 50 feet above the ground. Its brightness was that of a large spotlight and it seemed to be rotating slowly. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. The object hovered motionless for about 2 minutes and then accelerated at a terrific rate of speed, climbing at a steep angle and disappearing from view in about 5 seconds, and made no sound whatsoever. There were no other witnesses that I'm aware of, and this is the first and only such experience I have had. I am a registered nurse and am quite familiar with various aircraft operations, and I can assure you that this was no conventional aircraft of any kind. I hope this additional information is of some value to your investigation.

The image does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Statement, included at Blue Book, to the effect that the subject was not moving except when the witness would travel in an automobile. It is believed the object was stationary and only vibrant, almost as vibrant as the automobile was approaching me it had only vibrant red light that was visible, which reacted to the light. Witness "knows the object, or that I've ever seen with red lights that were as vibrant or brilliant".

Finally, witness became frightened because object appeared to so close and then disappeared and there was no sound at all. Unless one is willing to call this an absolute hallucination, that there was no physical outfit present whatever, the "aircraft" simply won't hold up.

This case is sufficiently interesting for me to interview the witness, as there were more details to gather one as stated. I made this personal investigation and report later.

23. 3 April 1967, Roseville, Michigan.
I would agree with the evaluation of possible birds, but I suppose to be fair we should also add, possible unidentified (data insufficient, no follow-up). The card indicates one object, and observed flying in V formation. This actually strengthens the "possible birds" evaluation.

24. 4 April 1967, Wheeling, W. Virginia. 
This is not in my files.

25. 5 April 1967, Westminster, Colorado
Since the 164 was not returned the evaluation "insufficient data", I suppose to entirely concurs. But the case itself is interesting in that there were 13 witnesses. Here is one case the Condon Committee should have looked into it particularly since there were 13 witnesses. Also the object was visible for 12 minutes, and it was observed through binoculars. Though also the object was worth a closer look, as a matter of fact, when I am in Boulder this July I will look into it myself, but for the statistician, the evaluation "insufficient data" certainly holds.
