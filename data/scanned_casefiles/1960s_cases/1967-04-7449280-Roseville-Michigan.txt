Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, so it went into the west.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Like spinning aerial noise around perimeter
b. Color: White lights

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
part of one of the lights

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch shows a curved line of circles moving from West to East, with an arrow indicating the direction of movement]

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

West B Straight A Fast

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 April 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Just was waiting my neighbor across the street that night and when I came out of the house, I had a noise in the distance. I didn't pay any attention to it until I approached the driveway of my home. I turned around and looked when the noise seemed to be coming clean overhead. When I first saw it I couldn't quite define a shape until it was almost directly overhead. Then it was very clear and the noise was clearly audible. I hope the information I have supplied can be of some help. I have answered the questions as clearly as I can remember to the best of my ability.

P.S. When I left my neighbors it was a couple minutes before 10:30

Statement, included at Blue Book, to the effect that the "object was not moving except when the witness would travel in the" is absolutely incorrect; if the witness is to be believed at all, it is stated that the object suddenly sped up and rushed away after "when it was approaching it had only vibrant red light that was visible".
With respect to the light, witness stated, "There is not a know of, or that I've ever seen with red lights that were as vibrant or as brilliant".

Finally, witness became frightened because object appeared so close directly over her car, and yet said there was no sound at all. Unless one is willing to call this an absolute hallucination, and that there was no physical outfit present whatever, the "aircraft" simply won't hold up.

This case is sufficiently interesting for me to interview the witnesses, as there were two rather than one as stated. They were independent and talked about it only after each had seen it separately.

I will make this personal investigation and report later.

23. 3 April 1967, Roseville, Michigan.

I would agree with the evaluation of possible birds, but I suppose to be fair should also add, possible unidentified (data insufficient, no follow-up). The card indicates one object, and the report, however, clearly indicates that 10 to 12 lights were observed flying in V formation. This actually strengthens the "possible birds" evaluation.

24. 4 April 1967, Wheeling, W. Virginia.

This is not in my files.

25. 5 April 1967, Westminster, Colorado

Since the 164 was not returned the evaluation "insufficient data", I suppose, is entirely correct, but the case itself is interesting in that there were 15 witnesses. Here is one case the Condon Committee should have looked into, since it was right at their back door. They should have looked into it particularly since there were 15 witnesses. Also the object was visible for 15 minutes, and it was observed through a telescope. Even at this late date this might be worth a call. As a matter of fact, when I am in Boulder this July I will look into it myself, but for the statistics, the evaluation "insufficient data" certainly holds.
