k. (1) Capt. Thomas C. Alfsen, Assistant Staff Judge Advocate, Contracts Division.

I was Officer of the Day on the 19th of February 1962 at which time I received a call from Capt. Russell Ford of the 693rd Radar Sq. indicating they had received a report on a UFO. I then contacted the two individuals who reported making the observation and interviewed them extensively as to what they had observed. Both men appeared to be qualified and reliable witnesses and during the course of the conversation, did not appear to be prone to exaggeration.

Mr. [redacted] who is a commercial fisherman, indicated that he had been a fisherman all of his life and that he had observed many natural phenomena in the sky, however, he had never seen anything comparable to the object in this instance. He indicated that he had observed sunspots or "sunspots", as he called it and he had also observed reflections upon aircraft right after the sun has set. However, he stated none of these would explain the present phenomena.

Mr. [redacted] on the other hand, indicates he has never really observed any object in the sky in the past.

The 693rd Radar Squadron, which is located at Dauphin Island, was contacted and they indicated that they did not pick up anything on the radar screen at the time this object was observed. Further, no other witnesses observed this object.

1. (1) None

SUBJECT: Supplement to UFO Report of 21 February 1962

TO: Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Subsequent to the telephone conversation with your office, the undersigned again contacted the 693rd Radar Squadron at Dauphin Island relative to the subject UFO. At this time it was learned that there were two additional witnesses to this observation. The first was Airman Second Class _______ and the second was Airman Third Class _______ both of that squadron. They indicated to me that they were on their way toward Mobile, which would be due North of the Island, traveling by private vehicle at about 2400Z when they observed this object. In the sky. They indicated that it was due West, or at 270°. The date of this observation was, of course, 19 February 1962.

2. I reviewed the information obtained from Mr. _______ and Mr. _______ and he verified that data and had this additional information to add in that he thought the object was approximately thirty (30) miles away and his personal feeling was that it was too large to be an aircraft.
