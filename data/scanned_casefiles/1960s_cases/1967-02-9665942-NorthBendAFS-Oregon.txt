Observer was driving PDV westward when two objects were following in line, separated by a distance approximately 10-12 times their own length. Both objects were glowing orange. Sequential flashing or blinking lights were noted. Objects looked like a flashlight through opaque orange plastic. Some kind of some kind.

Preceding night a hot air balloon was observed in the area. The description is consistent with that of a balloon (hot air) observation.

(4) TWO.

(5) FOLLOWING IN-LINE, SEPARATED BY A DISTANCE EQUAL TO
    APPROX 10-12 TIMES THEIR OWN LENGTH, CO-ALTITUDE.

PAGE 2 RUNBDF3304 UNCLAS

(5) SEQUENTIAL FLASHING OR BLINKING LIGHTS ON BOTH, AT OR
    NEAR THEIR BOTTOM EDGE. LIGHTS WERE NOT CONVENTIONAL AS
    WE WOULD CUSTOMARY THINK OF THEM, BUT APPEARED TO BE A
    MUCH BRIGHTER SPOT THAN THE REST OF THE OBJECT. LIGHT SOURCE
    APPEARED TO BE WITHIN THE OBJECT AND GAVE MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS
    BLINKING A FLASHLIGHT THROUGH AN OPAQUE ORANGE PLASTIC, WITH THE
    FLASHLIGHT BEING HELD A SLIGHT DISTANCE FROM THE PLASTIC. THE
    FLASHING LIGHTS, BELIEVED TO BE EIGHT IN NUMBER FOR EACH OBJECT,
    WERE BLINKING IN A 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, SEQUENCE.

    OBSERVER IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIGHTS WERE (1) IN ONE
    PLANE, BLINKING FIRST IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN REVERSING AND
    COMING BACK ON THE SAME PLANE, OR (2) BLINKING AROUND THE PERIMETER
    OF A CIRCLE, WHICH, AT A DISTANCE, WOULD GIVE MUCH THE SAME EFFECT.
    LIGHTS IN ONE DIRECTION APPEARED TO BE VERY SLIGHTLY DIMMER IN ONE
    DIRECTION, LENDING CREDENCE TO THE LATTER OF THE TWO ABOVE STATED
    POSSIBILITIES.
