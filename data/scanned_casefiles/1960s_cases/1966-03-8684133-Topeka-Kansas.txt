The image contains a photograph analysis report for an "Unidentified Flying Object Analysis" conducted on March 30th, in Forbes AFB, Kansas. The report indicates that a single negative print (5 x 7 inches) was analyzed and the results are presented in the report. However, the report does not contain an actual photograph, only the analysis details.

The text in the report is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-33
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ANALYSIS
LOCATION: FORBES AFB, KANSAS
DATE: 30 MAR

PHOTOGRAPHY:
A: 1. Negative, 1 (5 x 7) Print
1. PURPOSE: This report is written in response to Work Order Number 66-3, analysis to be performed as to what the unidentified object may be.
2. ANALYSIS: The analysis was conducted jointly by the Photo Analysis Division, TDDFP. The image which appears on the negative and the photograph is of insufficient definition for accurate analysis as to what the apparent object may be. The lack of background density and the absence of format outline, coupled with the presence marks simulated inedited on the image indicates this is possibly a hoax.
