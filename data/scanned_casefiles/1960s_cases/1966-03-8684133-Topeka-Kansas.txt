TENT/Maj Quintanilla, Jr/70916/h1/6 Oct 66

UFO Sightings, 30 March 1966, Forbes AFB, Kansas

Base Operations
Forbes AFB, Kansas

Reference UFO sighting 30 March 1966 submitted to Project Blue Book by your unclassified message, 838 AD 12332 April 1966. Enclosed is original negative that was submitted. Request negative be forwarded to A/3C H. Y. Yonemura, Jr, Forbes AFB, Kansas along with enclosed enlargement and the following Project Blue Book evaluation:

a. The image which appears on the negative and the photograph is of insufficient size and definition for accurate analysis as to what the apparent object may be. Any definite statement is precluded by the absence of exposure and processing information. However, the noticeable lack of background density and the absence of format outline, coupled with the presence of pressure marks superimposed on the image indicates this is possibly a processing aberration rather than an actual image.

Deputy for Technology & Subsystems

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ANALYSIS
LOCATION FORBES AFB, KANSAS DATE 30 MARCH 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF IR QUALITY
P NRS 1 Negative, 1 (5 x 7) Print

1. PURPOSE: This report is written in response to Work Order Number 66-34 requesting photo analysis be performed as to what the unidentified object may be.

2. ANALYSIS: Analysis was conducted jointly by the Photo Analysis Division, TDDPA and the Photo Processing Division, TDDPR.

3. The image which appears on the negative and the photograph is of insufficient size and definition for accurate analysis as to what the apparent object may be. Any definite statement is precluded by the absence of exposure and processing information. However, the noticeable lack of background density and the presence of format outline, coupled with the presence of pressure marks superimposed on the image indicates this is possibly a processing aberration rather than an actual image.
