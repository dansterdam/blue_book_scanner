1. The following report is submitted in the interest of the USAF:

At 2330, [redacted] of Bastrop, Texas, called the MOOD at Bergstrom to report an unidentified object. This call was made 10 June 1964.
At 0345 hours, 11 June 1964, MSgt Wills Mason of the Office of Information called Mr. [redacted] to obtain further information. Here is the text of Mr. [redacted] report:

At 1130 hours, I saw a bright green light. I was up from the horizon, loop bright, then settle down behind some trees. He stated the light was so bright that he could still see it behind the trees. He stated that the object seemed approximately the size of a penny held at arm's length. It was, he estimated, six miles northeast of Bastrop, which is located some 40 miles southeast of Austin, Texas. He stated that the object was in sight approximately 10 seconds. The sighting now appears to be inside the Bastrop State Park which is closed at that hour. He further said that the object reassembled at "flare" in all respects except the manner in which it moved.

2. Mr. [redacted] address is Bastrop, Texas, his telephone number is [redacted]
