PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 2 May 1962

2. LOCATION: SW Ohio

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 2000

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS: No

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 Seconds

7. SOURCE: Military and Civilian

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

9. COURSE: B-W

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Witnesses in SW corner of O. viewed an object moving S-W at great speed. Object was vari-colored, red-blue-green, but more blue-green. Several witnesses reported more than one object in cluster and moving together. Object reported very bright (brighter than brightest star). Witnesses now sure of size. Reported generally that it was big. Object disappeared by dimming and going out. Like light. Object described as 5 act. shiny, like atom & diamond formed. One witness report cloud with object.

11. COMMENTS:
Describes all characteristics of classic fireball (meteor). Duration, color and speed noted. Object was traveling in the opposite direction from earth's satellite (artificial). Sighting indicates no potential threat to national security. Sighting contained no evidence indicating object was not a fireball.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
[Checkboxes include: Was Balloon, Possibly Balloon, Was Aircraft, Possibly Aircraft, Was Astronomical Fireball, Possibly Astronomical, Other, Insufficient Data for Evaluation, Unknown]
