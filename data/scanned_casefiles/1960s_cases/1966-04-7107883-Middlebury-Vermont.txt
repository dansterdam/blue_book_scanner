11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Objects were star like lights, yellow to white, red, green at different times. Appeared 20-30 degrees off horizon in the east. Disappeared in the NE. Object hovered for 15 minutes in the NE. Initially the sighting was of an aircraft. A B-52 bomber on oil burner project at 7,000 ft heading west then 180 degree turn to east was in the area at the time of the sighting. Secondly when the aircraft lights disappeared the observers picked up a bright star, JUPITER. This would account for the one minute disappearance.

Handwritten notes at bottom: "Jupiter not in N.E. - Arctic"

DISTANCE AS WEATHER AFFORDED EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND
NO NOISE WAS HEARD. THE REPORTED TURNS AND CIRCLES WHICH
MADE BY A MANEUVERING AIRCRAFT WOULD GIVE OBSERVERS A
VEIN OF DIFFERENT NAVIGATION LIGHTS (FROM WHITE TO RED
PAGE 5 RUEDMA1632 UNCLAS
TO GREEN) DUE TO A CHANGE IN FLYING ALTITUDE OF AIRCRAFT.
LIGHTS WOULD APPEAR/DISAPPEAR WHEN FUSELAGE, WINGS, OR
TAIL BLOTTED OUT VIEW FROM OBSERVERS. THE STATEMENT MADE
BY ONE OBSERVER THAT ONE LIGHT VANISHED, AND THAT THE
OTHER LIGHT SEEN AS HOVERING, BY THE OTHER OBSERVER,
WAS ACTUALLY ONLY A STAR, LENDS CREDENCE THAT THE
AIRCRAFT'S NAVIGATION LIGHTS HAD FADED OUT AND THE ONE
OBSERVER HAD VISUALLY TRANSFERRED HIS ATTENTION FROM
AIRCRAFT LIGHTS TO A STAR. AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, IT
WAS REPORTED THAT A B-58 BOMBER ON E/W TURN OVER
PORT HENRY RES STOCK FARM - OIL BURNER SORTIE WAS IN
THE AREA. ALTHOUGH AT AN ALTITUDE OF 7,000 FT, THIS
AIRCRAFT MANEUVERS COULD HAVE BEEN OBJECT/ LIGHTS
SIGHTED, HOWEVER, THIS REPORTING OFFICER ASSESSES
SIGHTING AS SOME WELL LIGHTED AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA,
