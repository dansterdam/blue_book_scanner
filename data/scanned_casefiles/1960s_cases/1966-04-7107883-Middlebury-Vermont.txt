The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an official document titled "PROJECT 10073 RECORD". The document provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on April 22, 1966 in Middlebury, Vermont, as reported by 2 witnesses.

The text of the document is as follows:

DATE - TIME GROUP: 22 April 66 23/034/52
LOCATION: Middlebury, Vermont (2 Witnesses)
SOURCE: Civilian
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1 
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 minutes
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
COURSE: -
PHOTOS: 1 (DXNR?)
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None

CONCLUSION: Objects were lights, yellow to white, red, green at different times. Appeared 20-30 degrees off horizon in the east. Disappeared in the west. Object hovered for 15 minutes. Apparently the sighting was of an aircraft. A B-52 bomber on a training flight at 20,000 ft heading west then 180 degrees turn to east was in the area at the time of the sighting. Secondly, the aircraft lights disappeared as the observers picked up a bright star, probably JUPITER. This would account for the one light disappearing any the other sighting to hover for 14 minutes.

MADE BY A MANEUVERING AIRCRAFT WOULD GIVE OBSERVERS A
VIEW OF DIFFERENT NAVIGATION LIGHTS FROM WHITE TO RED

BY ONE OBSERVER THAT ONE LIGHT VANISHED, AND THAT THE
OTHER LIGHT SEEN AS HOVERING, BY THE OTHER OBSERVER,
WAS ACTUALLY ONLY A STAR, LENDS CREDENCE THAT THE
AIRCRAFT'S NAVIGATION LIGHTS HAD FADED OUT AND THE ONE
OBSERVER HAD VISUALLY TRANSFERRED HIS ATTENTION FROM
AIRCRAFT LIGHTS TO A STAR. AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, IT
WAS REPORTED THAT A F-89J ACKER ON PVT. TURN OVER
PORT HENRY RES STOCK FARM - OIL BURNER SCRIBE WAS IN
THE AREA. ALTHOUGH AT AN ALTITUDE OF 7,800 FT, THIS
AIRCRAFT MANEUVERS COULD HAVE BEEN OBJECT/LIGHTS
SIGHTED, HOWEVER, THIS REPORTING OFFICER ASSESSES
SIGHTING AS SOME WELL LIGHTED AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA.
