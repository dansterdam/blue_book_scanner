Transcribing the text in the document:

Bronx 8 Nov 1965
Had a report from a friend of information concerning a Flying
object which he saw 15.11.1965. Deleterious details were about 5570 ft
of a field where he stood. He saw 3 round objects, which made a noise not
like a helicopter but with a feeling of motion to them, as they did a
sudden move and stopped. Object was about 17 feet long and white in color.
He said it came closer to him for a sudden change of place
and again was in other place. It stayed about 15 to 20 minutes and then
went straight up and out of sight.
One can see that the details in the information, given by
the witness are indicative of a serious sighting rather than imagination. 
I recommend that this matter be investigated further, as the witness appears
to be reliable character. I ask that this information be given urgent
consideration.
Yours faithfully
