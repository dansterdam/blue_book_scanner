I have some information concerning my U.F.O. sighting on the night of Nov 18, 1965, I took my detail was about 5:40 pm, and I was on my way to the Backyard to do as (Duty) Patrolman at the 4th Precinct was about 5:15 pm.

I had a feeling or notion to look up. I saw a sudden I seemed to be a sudden I seems flying something (flying objects) was in view for about 40 seconds. The (flying objects) were in a very peculiar way. Still flying over the building of the 44th Precinct. I was flying at a very fast speed. I was seeing the flying objects very distinctly. I was about 2 streets away. I was seeing very clearly. I may be surprised I was seeing what I saw. I put the power on this in about 2 or 3 blocks. I put the power on flying about 2 or 3 blocks. I could hear the flying objects. The flying objects seemed like the street & the flying objects that were together (flying) that were together like this (20-30) I was going to write about this at the direction of Nov 18th 1967 that I thought I might tell believe me, that I thought this information will be of some value to you.

Over.
