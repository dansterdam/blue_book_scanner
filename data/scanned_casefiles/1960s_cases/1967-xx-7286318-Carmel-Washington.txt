Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir:
Enclosed is a letter explaining my reason for this letter to you, regarding UF.O.

On Wed morning Oct. 4th, at 4:30 A.M. I had awakened and looked out of the bedroom window, facing south, to see a most unusual object in the sky, which was unlike any plane, or telling star, meteor, etc. I have ever observed.

It was oval shape, with extremely brilliant white light emanating from the outline of the "saucer" shape. I must have observed it for 20 seconds or thereabouts, as it proceeded west over the ocean. We live in Carmel area, three miles east of highway #1 in Carmel Valley. It disappeared from sight into blackness. The thing had a brilliant white vapor trail.

The next day I phoned the newspaper and police and fd found that another observer had telephoned in, with the same description and time. He was a fisherman in the Monterey peninsula area for years and as we compared notes he said he had never before observed anything of the sort, and was also shocked by what it seemed to be.... Inexplicable.

His name is [redacted], of Monterey. I am Mrs. [redacted], and we would like to report the sighting and inquire as to whether any information is available regarding same. Please advise, if so.

Thanking you in advance,
I remain,
Yours truly,
[signature]
Pebble Beach.
