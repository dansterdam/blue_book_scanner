Dear sirs:

It was only recently that I saw your address mentioned in a magazine. I wish to report four UFO sightings I've made this year.

The first one occurred on the night of February 12th, 1961. My family was just returning from an out-of-town trip and we were traveling on a highway going in a southeasterly direction. The time was 7:30 P.M. and it was dark out. I was sitting in the front seat of the car when I noticed the UFO. As I looked through the windshield, there was nothing unusual about the object at first. It was a white light I saw and I didn't see any body behind it. It moved from left to right and once flashed green. The object moved to the right, circled a few times, and returned to the left. It kept going and soon disappeared behind the scenery. I watched it for approximately one minute.

I don't remember the dates of the next sightings, but these are listed in chronological order. It was dark outâ€”between 8:45 and 9:00, I believe. I was taking the garbage out to the alley and strayed a few moments afterward as usual. Looking at the stars, I saw one of them was apparently moving. I got it fixed and ran two other stars and later on a view from a post close to me. I ran to the house to get my telescope. I returned to find the light indistinguishable from the stars. I stood there for several moments and finally went into the house. Both this sighting and the one above were made in clear skies. This light was heading in a southerly direction.

The third sighting I remember well. It occurred on the last day of school for the year. I was walking home and, as usual, was looking at the sky (I'll increase in UFO's and the like, so I observe whenever I have the chance). I spotted an object which seemed to be a dull-silver in color and was not at all shiny. It's altitude did not seem to be very high, and it was traveling at a low speed, I might say it was cruising. No sound. The date was June 3rd, 1961. Time: between 3:30 and 4:00 P. M. I don't wear a watch, but would guess I viewed it for at least three minutes. It was traveling in a south-north direction and I watched it was out of sight.

My last sighting was at 8:41 P. M. on June 21st, 1961. I was outside in the back yard looking skyward when I noticed a light, which I first thought to be red in colour, but it later

seemed white. I couldn't tell whether or the light was low or high in altitude. It seemed to be traveling very slowly, but not slow enough to be a satellite. It went from south to north and I viewed it for two or three minutes. When I first saw it, I ran into the house and got my 20x30 telescope. It (the UFO) was not very big, although larger than a satellite. I was out of my sight before I could get the telescope focused properly. I believe the sky was clear.

I didn't check these sightings with the air force here in town (which, by the way, is Carswell) and read of no other similar ones in this area. I really saw these things. This is not a prank.

Perhaps you'd like to know a little about me. This year I graduated from the ninth grade and am 15 years old. My grades aren't low and I neither smoke, nor drink. I have two hobbies. One is reading science-fiction and fantasy and corresponding with others interested in the same things. My other hobby is reading about UFO's and flying saucers. Yes, I believe in flying saucers, so you'll probably throw this letter away. A friend of mine recently wrote me that some persons he knows have spotted UFO's. If you like, I can write to these people and ask them to write to you.

Yours sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
