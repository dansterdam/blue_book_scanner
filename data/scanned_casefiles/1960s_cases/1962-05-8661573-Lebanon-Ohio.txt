Transcribed text from the document:

Gentlemen:
About 9:45 P.M. on Saturday, one 1/2 hour later, a rather brilliant light passed over at a considerable distance to the west going in a northerly direction. At first we thought it was a plane or satellites but it was much too slow and bright. It passed out of sight in a northerly direction. This was just as it was getting dark that evening. My wife and I were sitting on the porch and it was very plain and distinct. There was no sound and it moved in a straight line at a steady pace. I have seen many unusual things in the skies over this area, but this was the brightest and most distinct I have ever seen.
Very truly yours,
[Redacted]

Gentlemen:

About 9:10 P.M. (our time) Sunday May 6th I watched a daytime object go across our farm about 3 miles distant so bright it overpowered the stars and it took a good 5 minutes before it passed out of sight.
This time I have ever seen one so bright. Can you tell me what it was?

Thanks.

Text from the document:

23 May 1962

Dear Sir, 

Reference your letter requesting identification of an unidentified flying object sighted by you on May 23, 1962. The satellite seen could be a Discoverer satellite from the Lebanon, Ohio, area. This passed overhead from northwest to southeast. It is our conclusion that this was normal satellite activity.

I have included the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on this subject for your further information.

Sincerely,
