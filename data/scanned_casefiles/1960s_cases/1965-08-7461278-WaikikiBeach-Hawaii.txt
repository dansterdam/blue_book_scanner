REPLY TO
ATTN OF: PACAF Base Command (BDI)                   9 August 1965
SUBJECT: U.F.O.'s in Hawaii - 2 August to 5 August 1965

TO: AFSC (FTD)
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area, 2 August to 5 August 1965. Five UFO's were reported. One of them (part b) received widespread headlines in Hawaii resulting in increased reporting and publicity regarding UFO's.

a. On 3 August, 0600Z (2/2000 local) a family living in Waikiki beach reported bright lights moving across the sky at high altitudes and on various headings. The lights appeared to change colors from red to blue. During the telescope conversation with the family, I was able to observe the sky from a position approximately 7 miles from Waikiki. I saw nothing except some bright stars. Since no one else reported the lights, even though they reportedly were flying over a heavily populated area, I consider the report to be non-significant.

b. On 4 August, 0644Z (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky south-west of Oahu. The reports differed on the colors but all agreed that it was a very bright light. Two pilots who were flying at 31,000' on the 2609 radial 180 NM out of Honolulu VORTAC said it was bright enough to illuminate the cockpit as it fell to the north of them. Both pilots believed that it burned out before hitting the water. Observers from the Pacific missile range said it appeared to them to look like a re-entry vehicle. The two pilots said it finally broke into three pieces before burning out. Our investigation revealed that it could not have been from U.S. space operations - and it is unlikely that it was Russian. Tentative analysis is that it was a meteor or less likely, a decaying space vehicle, which fell approximately 100 to 150 NM southwest of Oahu at position 193N/159-36W.

Here is the text from the document:

c. On 4 August at 1230Z (approximately) the crew of a TAC C-130 enroute from Travis AFB to Hickam AFB observed a high altitude, high speed UFO pass directly overhead on heading 2290, Location of the aircraft was 125N to 123N-35N, altitude 20,000'. Object was a bright light.

(1) Ocean station November sighted the same object and reported that it lit up the whole sky as it passed overhead.

(2) Investigation revealed that it was probably an Atlas missile fired from Vandenburg AFB. The bright light over ocean station November resulted from a flash fire from fuel still left in the booster on separation. Time of the missile firing was 1243Z. This was 13 minutes later than the sighting report by the aircraft. However, the aircraft was not exactly sure of the time. Therefore, I believe the sighting and the missile flight were in fact one and the same.

d. On 5 August, at 1311Z, several aircraft at 28-33N/145W, reported a rocket firing from the surface of the ocean. The object climbed rapidly and flew into the clouds on heading 0490. One aircraft also reported a group of five ships within the area of the launch.

(1) A query to CINCPACFLT OPS PLOT revealed that the sighting was probably a navy operation being conducted in that area at that time.

e. Also on 5 August at 0500Z, a teenager reported a bright light in the sky. Since no other details were available, and no other reports made, the sighting was ruled non-significant and no investigation was made.

2. This information is forwarded as background information only.
