10. CONCLUSION
Astro(Capella)
Capella was on an Azimuth of 15 degrees at an elevation of approximately 6 degrees.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Approximately 20 persons watched a star like object in the northern sky for over thirty minutes. Red and green were the main colors noted. The light appeared to change color from red to green as if by slow rotating beacon. The object was brighter than a star. The object appeared to move only slightly both side to side and up and down. The object was still in the same spot after thirty or more minutes.

The one observer wrote back to report that they had seen the same thing in the same place for several nights. They now felt that the object was a star.

TEST, UFO (Maj Quintanilla)/70916/mba/26 Sep 67)
UFO Observation, 22 August 1967

Ely, Minnesota 55731

Reference your observation of August 22, 1967 which you reported to the Air Force. We appreciated your note containing your explanation. The Aerial Phenomena Branch did perform an investigation on your sighting and found that you probably observed the star Capella. At the time of your sighting, Capella would have been an azimuth of approximately 15 degrees. Capella, because of its brightness, has often been misinterpreted for an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Again, we appreciated your note in which you expressed your comments on the now identified flying object (IFO).

Director of Technology and Subsystems
