UFO Sighting, 27 Nov 65

Hq USAF SAFQICC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the attached letter from requesting information on his unidentified observation. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear

It is not unusual for meteors to appear with a green color; however, it is unusual for them to appear to land so close. We have had reports of meteors appearing to land in the next county, when in reality the same meteor was observed more than 300 miles away.

We have taken the liberty of forwarding your report to the American Meteor Society for possible correlation with other sightings which may have occurred in the New England area.

Gentlemen:

I feel like we said writing this but I am not even whether this would be of interest to your department in me.

Last night, around 8:15 my son came I was driving home from the local store in Mount Vernon within we noticed a light bright, green, mixed with yellow flame appear on the sky and fall in the near-by woods.

Feeling that this was a matter, we went out the morning to my land looked it but were unable to do so in the did time we were out. Since I found the green color strange, I was curious about the competition (perhaps) and felt that perhaps your department could tell me whether this is unusual or not. If there exists some leads to the matter, most of us would go to investigate this would welcome and look it over.

If this is any interest from your department, please advise.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]
