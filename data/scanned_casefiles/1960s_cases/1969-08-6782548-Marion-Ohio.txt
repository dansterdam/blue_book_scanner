DEPT (UFO)

UFO OBSERVATION, 23 AUG 69

Mr. --------
Marion, Ohio 43302

Reference your UFO observation of 23 Aug 1969. We feel that your report was of sufficient interest to warrant the following:

2:30 a.m. EDT, 23 Aug 69, an object was over 330 longitude and 40 latitude at an altitude of approximately 225 miles. The object traveled in a southerly direction and passed into the earth's shadow at approximately 2:35 a.m. EDT at coordinates 325 longitude and 39 latitude. At this time, the satellite was at an altitude of 218 statute miles. We feel that your observation was almost certainly of an orbiting satellite moving in a southerly course. After approximately 17.6 minutes the object became obscured from sight due to the earth's shadow.

DOCTOR, QUINTANILLA, JR., Lt. Colonel, USAF
