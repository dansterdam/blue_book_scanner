11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object that at a distance looked similar to the landing lights of an airplane. When closer however the object appeared roughly elliptical and had what appeared as windows along the side. The object had a steady floating motion and appeared yellow in color. The observer said he thought the object passed closer than permissible to an eastbound transport.

COMMENTS: The description of the object is similar to that of a garnet bag hot air balloon. However the wind was probably blowing toward the south during the sighting, not west. The duration and description could also be of satellite decay. Object #2951 described at 1200 plus or minus 12 hrs on 6 Oct. However it would not have been traveling westerly in its de-orbit. Since the object passed so close to the transport, one would expect the pilot to have seen the object. However nothing was reported to the volunteer crew.

FLIGHT NETWORK: Another possible explanation could be westbound plane with both its landing and anti-collision lights on.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letters of May 6th and May 7th.

In checking the VGN pilot report files I find no report for August 20th 1967 between the hours of 2300Z and 2330Z.

There is likewise no report for October 6th, 1967 anywhere near the Northeast area of the U.S.A.

A continuous check of the March files still show no report for March 24th, 1968 between the hours of 0103Z to 0115Z.

I am very sorry that I have been unable to help you with any of the above requests. Please be sure to write if there is anything further that I might be able to help you with.

Sincerely Yours,

H. W. Roth, Project Director

(U) Oct 6-1967

United States Air Force
Officer in charge of UFO
Investigations —

Dear Sir;

At about 4 am this
morning, in going to the state
room, I looked out of the
window to observe the two
Planets (2) now so clear on
the morning sky.

As I looked, I observed a
very bright flight behind
nearly trees, at least as
bright as a plane's landing
lights, and wondered why a
WESTBOUND plane (Apparent...)


- page 8 -

Here is the text from the document:

(out of Newark or Kennedy)
would have landing lights on.
As I watched, I was amazed
to note that the entire
"object" was aglow, and seemed
to "float" or glide rather
than move proved.

As it came closer, I
got this view (next page)
of the entire object—
Very clearly.


- page 9 -

Here is the text from the document:

Entire object approx

Bright on approach, but not when in
line with moon - Then about height
as full moon. No exhaust seen.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an oval or disc-shaped object with some lines around it, seemingly representing light or movement.


- page 10 -

Here is the text from the document:

The motion was similar to a satellite - but of course, for close, faster (to eye)

(VIEW # 1)

BRILLIANT
(BEHIND TREE)

VIEW # 2
(ELONGATING)

VIEW # 3 (as sketched)

At no time did it appear as a CIRCLE OR SAUCER
9 does not feel the square


- page 11 -

Lights and cabin lights on. The sudden disappearance of the object could also be explained by the pilot switching off his lights.


- page 12 -

Notes

Direction - East to West
Size - (Difficult to determine)
Altitude - (Est) 1500 Ft.
Speed - Same as Slow Plane
Flight - Steady, Even
Noise - None

The sky was unusually light with a slight haze, and
If it were a plane, 9 seem thus,
(Silhouette)

[A hand-drawn sketch of an oval/disc-shaped object with a small rectangular section in the middle is included at the bottom of the page]


- page 13 -

Here is the text from the document:

the sides were usually
windows.

Other factors:
(1) An Eastward Transport
was going over at a greater
altitude, and seemed clear
to the UFO than possible.

9 marker lights were flashing, and site markers could
have ruled any sound from
the UFO - No - No clouds,
reflection is out - plus, only
marker lights on Transport.

Respectfully
Submitted,
