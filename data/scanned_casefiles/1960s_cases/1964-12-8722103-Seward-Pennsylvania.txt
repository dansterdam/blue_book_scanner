Mr. [redacted]
Seward, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Thank you for your recent letters describing possible satellite re-entries. The objects which you have described are similar to either meteor or satellite decay reports.

Satellite decays are distinguished from meteor observations by the direction of flight and duration of the sighting. A satellite re-entry over Pennsylvania would hold an easterly component and the duration would be slightly longer than that described in your letter.

The Air Force appreciates your reported meteor sightings and is interested in observations of this type as the characteristics are very similar to those of satellite decay.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr.
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
