Dear Sir:

I would like to report a UFO I saw on the 7th of February 1969. It was a semi-circle white light within with pulsating light near the 9 o'clock position below). I first saw it at 8:15 PM moving northeast with no sound or exhaust trail. I watched it for about 3 minutes and it disappeared behind Barlow Lewis. I was about the size of a penny held at arm's length.
