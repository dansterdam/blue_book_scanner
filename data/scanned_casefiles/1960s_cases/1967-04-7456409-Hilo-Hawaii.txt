(5) Formation: None (None)

(6) Discernible features: Top appeared to be of parachute material, orange and white striped with light located below. Lights appeared stable but top appeared to be unstable and wobbled from side to side. (Top appeared to be transparent with 4 or 5 hula hoops above the lights in horizontal fashion.)

Comments:
(1) Possibly a plastic bag balloon. It could be possible that the object was a bigger plastic bag than is ordinarily used, with at least 20 candles instead of the usual one. However, it is interesting to note that the lights went out instantly and simultaneously, something that would be hard to

achieve with candles. Wind direction, while
not exactly in the same direction as the flight of
the object, was in the same general direction and
indeed may have been in the same direction at some
altitude below 10,000'.

(2) Another possibility: An ordinary weather type
balloon with battery powered light devices suspend-
ed under it. The hula hoop effect may have been
caused by the suspension lines cutting into the
balloon.

(3) Third possibility: A plasma of ionized air.
The orange color is about the same as a low energy
plasma. The manner in which the lights went out
might indicate the plasma suddenly lost its electrical
charge. However, the cross effect might not be
equated with a plasma phenomena.

(4) These ideas are pure speculation and at the
moment cannot be supported by evidence. Similar
lights, although not cross shaped, have been report-
ed over the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Oahu during
the last 3 years. In all instances they have been
listed as unknown since we could not find a reason
for them. Indeed, in most cases we ruled them
insignificant according to the criteria of AFR 80-17.
However, they are being seen by the public and we
cannot find a reasonable explanation. Some of them
may be hoaxes, but not all, because the locations
of some of the sightings, such as the remote sides
of volcanoes and over water areas between some of
the islands are not logical launching points for
pranksters.

(5) Attached is another man's opinion. Hilo has
just received CAB approval for direct flights from
the mainland.

Honolulu Advertiser April 28 1967
"Where You Say Da Kine Direct Flights Coming From?"

The image appears to be a cartoon with cartoon characters, a palm tree, a sign that says "Hilo", and a UFO-like object labeled "Reported UFO" with legs.
