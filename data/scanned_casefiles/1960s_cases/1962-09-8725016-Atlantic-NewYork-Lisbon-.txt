REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Telephone Call: Received by Major R. J. Hamer
Time: 1013 Hours, 28 September 1962
Place: Dover, New Jersey
Address: 

Resume of Conversation:
He (the witness) and his brother were at the USAGO station at the time of the sighting. They observed an object in the sky at an approximate elevation of 30 degrees and azimuth of 225 degrees. The object was at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet for a duration of approximately 5 minutes. The object appeared to be round or circular in shape, quite large, and was brightly illuminated, like a powerful spotlight. It passed at a tremendous speed with no noise or trail. It passed directly over the USAGO station and then disappeared from sight to the west. The witness wished to also report it to Picatinny Arsenal, as it may be of interest to them. He indicated that the object appeared to be originating from Russia inasmuch as it appeared to approach from that direction and linger at one point. He would be happy to discuss this further with Picatinny Arsenal personnel, if interested.

Subject: Report of unusual aerial phenomenon encountered during subject flight.

1. At approximately 2200Z on 8 September 1962, while in flight from New York to Lisbon, Portugal, at an altitude of 33,000 feet, the navigator observed an unidentified aerial object through the cockpit window.

2. The object was first sighted at a bearing of approximately 270 degrees relative to the aircraft's heading. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated at approximately 3000 knots. The object was observed for approximately 5-10 seconds before it disappeared from view.

3. The object appeared to be oval in shape, with a brilliant white luminous glow. No other distinguishing features were observed.

4. The navigator immediately reported the sighting to the pilot, who also briefly observed the object before it disappeared.

5. This report is submitted for your information and further investigation as deemed appropriate.
