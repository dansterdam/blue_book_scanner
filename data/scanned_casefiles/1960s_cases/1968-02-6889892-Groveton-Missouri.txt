11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer was awakened by several of his cows bawling. The observer rushed to his living room and sighted a craft that was estimated to be about 100 to 150 ft in diameter and had concave sides. A bright yellow-green light came from the concave side of the craft and the craft itself produced a pulsating sound similar to a piece of wire whirled at high speed, above a person's head. During this time, the cows were staring at the object which was about 100 to 200 ft away and about 25 ft. above the ground. Finally the cows whirled and ran into the barn. Shortly afterward the craft moved away rapidly toward the SW.

Missouri City, Mo. 64111

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am enclosing an article which appeared in Kansas City Star, on April 23, 1963. I was very interested because sometime during February I had my daughter and I heard the same kind of noise.

I was awakened one night about 2:30, by this pound. Please understand I saw not a flying saucer but I am very interested and feel rather believe not decisive but have an open mind. I have never heard a sound to compare with this, and interestingly enough, half awoke and rushing to the window, my first thought was "170" - I could see nothing, but my description of the sound is exactly the same as the one quoted in the article.

My daughter, who is 20, heard the same sound several nights later.


- page 3 -

Here is the text from the document:

Just by the time she awakened me, I could only hear it faintly, receding into the distance -

We mentioned this to some friends who told us perhaps this was a new device the police were occasionally using on their cars - We were finally able to hear this, and the similes to some degree, it was not the same thing by any means.

Roughly speaking, I think we heard these noises about the middle of February -

I had to write you, because I was actually disunfounded to read such a literal description of what I too, had heard but not seen.

Sincerely,
[signature is blacked out]

Air Force Asks St. Joseph, Mo.
Official for Report

St. Joseph, Mo. (AP)â€”Assistance in obtaining information concerning a reported unidentified flying object in the Gower, Mo. area at 4:30 o'clock in the morning, February 9, was asked of John C. Riley, jr., city aviation director, by the Air Force.

The request came from Maj. Hector Quintanilla, chief of the Aerial Phenomena office of the Foreign Technology division of the Air Force headquarters at the Wright Patterson base in Ohio.

The letter from the Air Force stated:

The Aerial Phenomena office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Gower, Mo. The observer sighted an object which appeared to be a noise. It sounded similar to the roar of a piece of wire, whirred, and had pulsating rhythm of some kind. Initially the object was moving toward the southwest, the noise was loud or these times louder and the speed above normal and more rapid.

1. Your letter subject as above, dated 17 April 1968, was referred to this office by the Public Information Office, Headquarters, Fort Leavenworth for action.

2. The description of the sighting does resemble, in an intangible way, the manner in which members of the lately described our helicopters. However, our helicopters seldom operate in the vicinity of Gower, Missouri. More specifically, our records reveal no helicopter flights on 9 February 1968.

3. Sherman Army Airfield Control Tower is non-operational during the period 2300 to 0700 hours, therefore, it was not in a position to receive any reports of unusual objects or noises. The airfield operations office is open on a 24 hours basis and no report pertinent to the alleged sighting was received.

COMMENTS: Several Police Depts. and Airports in the area were contacted to determine if they had received any reports; had themselves seen anything unusual; and if there were any helicopter activities in the area. No one else in the area seems to have seen anything unusual and although several people thought the description somewhat similar to that of a turbine helicopter no record could be found of any helicopter activity in the area.

NOTE: The observer is near sighted but did not have his glasses on at the time of the sightings.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Your memorandum of April 17, 1968, in reference to a reported UFO observation at Gower, Missouri, on February 9, 1968, was relayed to me by the Municipal Aviation Department.

Except for unusual incidents, we have disposed of our aircraft movement records for the concerned date. No incident similar to the UFO observation was recorded at the control tower.

Helicopter operations from this airport normally do not operate in the area or at the time involved.

The observations related in paragraph 2 of your memorandum give indication of low altitude operation of a turbine-powered helicopter. I would suggest contacting Sherman AAF, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and Marshall AAF, Ft. Riley, Kansas, for possible information. Those facilities are both southwest of the location reported and conduct extensive helicopter operations.

Sincerely,

To:   Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

1. In accordance with your letter of 25 March 1968 requesting that I contact Mr. and Mrs. Groveton, Missouri with reference to Mr. UFO sighting, I have the following to report:

2. [Redacted] is in the hospital with a kidney stone so I first talked with [redacted], who, however, did not seem very cooperative. The conversation revealed that she is a housekeeper of speaking and thinking. The conversation was quite casual. She mentioned that her husband works out-of-town. At first, she was not particularly helpful.

The following day I called Mr. [redacted] at the hospital and had an extended talk with him. No other significant facts concerning the sighting itself emerged from the conversation. His letter does not wish to fill out our questionnaire.

3. I feel that little could be added, and he pointed out that he nearly didn't. He feels that little could be added, and he pointed out that he nearly didn't. He feels that little could be added, and he pointed out that he nearly didn't write his letter in the first place so only because he felt the matter might be of some interest to the government. I questioned him on such matters as duration, angular sizes, recollections, and whether he did or did not see an object in front of any object but he thought to only have passed something behind two trailing trees. He said that he could occasionally see to the ground for about ten times as long as the duration of takeoff and disappearance.

4. Mr. [redacted]'s whole manner of speech was careful and he made no attempt to embellish his story, or to do anything other than stick to the facts. He seems to have no particular bias for or against the incident to anyone other than his wife. He feels no goal could come from talking about it. I would have to give him very poor ratings on so basically and unexpectedly.

He is, however, nearsighted and although he tells me he can drive without glasses he rarely does. Had he had his glasses on he feels he could have observed more details than he did.

3.   This case must be evaluated as unidentified. Since it is a one-witness case (it we exclude the cows as witnesses) we are up the familiar blind alley with the question as to whether there was an actual image on Mr. retina at the time of his sighting. There is always the possibility that this could have been a vivid dream or an outright hallucination. We do not understand under what conditions such hallucinations occur but in my recent visit in London I spoke at great length with a well-known psychiatrist who is doing research in hypnosis and he tells me the following:

One out of 20 people appear to be capable of deep trance hypnosis. In some five cases in which he had hypnotized the people who have had spectacular UFO sightings he has found that in all cases these people were capable of deep trance hypnosis. Dan Denes, our Defense Research Center psychologist, under suggestion by the hypnotist. The question remains whether they are also capable of hallucination without hypnosis. This is an interesting possibility and might go a long way toward explaining many of the single witness cases.

I questioned Mr. [redacted] as to whether he had ever been hypnotized and that he said he never had and that "sort of stuff was out of his field".

If we do not accept hallucination, and there is no a priori reason to accept it, we are faced with the generally unreliable conclusion that Mr. [redacted] had seen some sort of artifact, weather condition, aircraft, or mirage, etc., which would serve to explain this sight-ing.

Re: U. F. O.

Dear Sir:

I reside on a farm approximately 30 miles north of Kansas City, Missouri. The residence is approximately 1/4 mile back from the highway with a pasture in front of the dwelling. I am employed in town and operate a cow herd on an all grass farm. If there is a disturbance among my cattle, I arise to their bawling as would a mother to her crying child.

Last night I heard several cows bawl as though frightened or scared. I immediately jumped from my bed and ran to the picture window in my living room. It was a dark night but there was a distinct glow giving off considerable light immediately in front of the house (approximately 300 to 350 feet away). It made sufficient light for me to maneuver around a card table left in the middle of the room, and to see cattle in the pasture in a rough semi-circle to the left of the light now.

As my vision adjusted from darkness to this moderate light, I was able to see parts of what appeared to be a tremendous circular object, reproduced as best I can on the attached sketch.

The light was a yellowish green and came from the concave sides of the craft. I could not tell whether it came from a translucent surface or was reflected from the base of the craft against a shiny surface and then back to the ground. In any event, there was sufficient light to see the major limbs on some walnut trees, a stump, the cows, fence in the foreground and other details.

The object appeared to be at least 100 feet in diameter, and to be hovering 20 to 25 feet above the ground...although I could not say that it was not on

on the ground, or possibly higher in the air. There were definitely seven open-
ings or portholes in the concave center of the craft. Their spacing would indicate that, if the craft were in fact round, there were probably 16 of
these equally spaced around the craft. I could not see distinctly enough to
tell if they were square, rectangular, oval or round. It was difficult to arrive
at a perspective to judge their size but I would "guess" they were two feet to 30
inches in approximate diameter. I saw no door or distinct opening. I saw no
living thing enter or depart the craft. I have no idea whether I watched half a
minute or five minutes, I was so entranced by the sight.

I have been losing a cow or two now and then, undoubtedly stolen, without a trace.
My first reaction, on hearing the cows, was that someone was among them. On seeing the craft I remember thinking "No wonder I have found no evidence. They are
being hauled off by air." At that moment I had no thought of what I saw being
a possible U.F.O., but rather some monstrous helicopter or other craft.

Some of the cows were staring at this object from perhaps 100 to 200 feet away.
Cows with younger calves were bawling, and some of the calves were answering.
Finally one cow whirled and ran, with tail high, toward the barn. The others
followed and in only a few seconds there were no cattle in sight. The craft remained some little time after the cows departed, but I have no idea whether this
was half a minute or considerably longer. It was during this time that I concentrated on the object in an attempt to make out all details I could.

All during this time there had been a distinct noise that I have difficulty in
describing. It sounded something like the swish of a piece of wire which one
might whirl around above his head at high speed and yet it had a pulsating
rhythm of some kind. When the craft departed, this noise was two or three times
louder and the sound pulsations were more rapid. The craft moved away rapidly
tilted in my way from the horizontal position it had maintained at, or above,
ground level.

When this brief experience was over I had hot flashes and felt chilled at the
same time, and was perspiring all over. I went back to the bedroom and was surprised that my wife had not awakened. I then recalled I had not seen my dog
or heard him bark although he is usually quite alert to any disturbance.

I am 57 years of age, employed at [redacted] for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
Company in Kansas City, Missouri, and of sober habits. Last night I had attended
the County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, of which I [redacted]
I came home about a quarter to ten, watched the news on T-V and retired.

I certainly seek no notoriety or publicity of any kind. If I can be of any
