July 28-- Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph Dellessandro of E. Weymouth, Mass.
reported 5 bright circular objects over Rockesett, N.H.
It took 20 minutes for the formation to cross the sky with
the last object hovering for 15 minutes.

An extremely odd incident took place about July 26th, at 9:30 P.M., on a lonely road near Parana, Argentina. A 17-year-old youth was riding his motorcycle when the headlight fell on a weird-looking person standing on the left side of the road. According to the young man, named Ricardo Mieres, his motorcycle stalled to obey him, and went against his wishes to within a few inches of the creature. He described the creature as being over six feet tall, with a head "in the shape of a melon" and three eyes. The creature stood motionless, then suddenly reached out with its light hand and grasped Mieres' scarf. It then turned around in a strange manner, began to grow in size in a robot-like manner, leaving deep tracks in the dirt as it left. An evidenced white light was seen low in the sky in the direction toward which the creature was moving. Mieres drew his motorcycle at full speed to the center of the city, and returned to the spot later with several other motorcyclists. They found the scarf, and all saw the deep tracks which Mieres had described to his friends.

Northampton, O.         7/27/62
1030 FILTER...A group of
persons gathered outdoors,
observed a very slow-moving,
lighted object moving from 3
to 7. It was described by
observer as a dark, just-
visible, pencil-shape with 8
or 10 colored lights which
were perceptible at range
from observer. Within 5 min-
utes it moved out - these
lights seemed to be a part
of the dark shape and were
situated in the lower part
of it. In its path from E
to W the object was not en-
tirely of clear 2-300' but
changed its position two or
three times. It disappeared
from sight to 15°. The sky
was clear, no sound. Alti-
tude undetermined. Slightly
after dark. Brightly red bull-
like object full silently
towards its ground and dis-
appeared in mid-air...no
sound or trail.

...On the night of July 29th, a brightly-lit object was seen on and near the ground by many people living in the vicinity of Lincoln, Wisconsin. It seemed to have antennas, according to the witnesses. It was seen at a considerable distance, floating near the ground most of the time, and occasionally rising higher to do "U-turns" and other unusual actions in the sky...

Northampton, O.                   7/28/62
12:30 AM EDT......An object
which had two white lights,
one above, the other, moved
very slowly from W to W. The
upper one was somewhat re-
taining and larger than the
lower one. The object was
at an altitude of 7,000 ft.,
at an elevation of 25°. Its
color was a subdued white;
no lights. The object was seen
with 7 x 50 binoculars and ex-
tremely deliberate, and no sound
was heard. Through the course
of its flight, the object could
not be identified as an air-
craft. It was seen
for about 5 minutes in its
steady course. Two ob-
served further observation.

AFRO BULLETIN..........March..........1963

SIGHTINGS:    An object which changed di-
rection faster than would be possible with
a regular aircraft, was sighted by two
boy scouts and three staff members of
Camp Lakota in Illinois on 12 July 1962.
In a later addresaed to Prof C. Varez,
Physics Professor at Defiance College,
the J C Holley family of Defiance gave
this description:

    The first object sighted was like a
cigar with a pointed tail. The next ob-
jects seen were shaped the same, but were
smaller and appeared to come from the
larger one.

    Bob Easley, 11, reported the fol-
lowing information on a sighting which
was made on July 17:    The object was ci-
gar-shaped, didn't appear to have wings,
and changed direction too fast to be a
balloon. It blinked on and off, was a
yellow at first, then changed to light
blue and then back to yellow again. It
didn't give off a trail.

    Ronald B. Baringer, who has 3000
hours flying time and a commercial pi-
lot's rating, gave this account of his sight-
ing on July 30:    "It was much larger
than a star, was moving at about 1000
mph. It raised straight up to an alti-
tude of about 1,000 feet and lowered
again to 200 feet. This raising and low-
ering was done at speeds much greater
than any helicopter was capable of do-
ing. It moved unbelievably faster than
the fastest jet I have ever seen operate.

    "In the raising and lowering opera-
tion there was no flame but just a super
bright light and I could observe no de-
finite shape. On every forward motion
on a horizontal plane there was a jet of
flame about 3/4 the size of the object.

    "The object itself was a brilliant
orange-red color of light and the je-
made when traveling was more blue-white
and was not present when it hovered. I
have seen flares dropped at night, parachute
flares dropped at night, and other aerial
airplanes at night, jets at night, and
helicopters operate, and certainly none of these."

    Ronald B. Baringer, who has 3000 hrs
flying time and a commercial pilot rat-
ing, gave this account of his sighting on
July 30:    "It was much larger than a star,
was moving at about 100 mph.    It raised
straight up to an altitude of about 200
feet. This raising and lowering was done
at speeds much greater than a helicopter
was capable of doing. It moved unbeliev-
ably faster than the fastest jet. I have
never seen it operate.

    "In the raising and lowering opera-
tion there was no flame but just a super
bright light and I could observe no de-
finite shape. On every forward motion
on a horizontal plane there was a jet of
flame about 3/4 the size of the object.

    "The object itself was a brilliant
orange-red color of light and the je-
made when traveling was more blue-white
and was not present when it hovered.
I have seen flares dropped at night, parachute
flares dropped at night, parachutes
dropped at night, airplanes at night, jets
at night, and helicopters operate, and
this object was certainly none of these."

Barometers React
To "Meteor"

A mysterious bright object flashed across the western sky in Western Washington at 10:45 p.m. on 31 July 1962. The object was seen by numerous observers and was described as a bright light moving across the sky. Some witnesses reported that it was brighter than the full moon and left a trail behind it.
