No Case (Information Only)                                                 28 July 1962
Paraná, Argentina

P.s: On July 26th at 2135 a man traveling in a car saw an odd luminous object passing high overhead and heading in an ENE direction at a speed estimated to be several times faster than any conventional aircraft. The object was a very intense bluish-white color and was glowing brightly. It appeared to be circular in shape and had a diameter estimated to be about 15 to 20 feet. It seemed to be emitting a beam or ray of light from its underside, which caused the ground and trees below to be illuminated in a bluish-green color.

The witness stated that the object was noiseless, and appeared to change direction slightly during the course of its flight. After traveling for about 3 or 4 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated to an extremely high speed and disappeared from sight.

The witness stated that he has observed many aircraft both military and civilian, and that this object was unlike anything he had ever seen before. He described it as being a most peculiar sight, and stated that there were several other persons who also observed the object, and who confirmed his description of it.

10130 - 11:30 P.M. A. number of persons gathered outdoors, observed a very slow-moving, light-colored object to the southwest. It was described by the observer as a dark, just visible in the light, seemed to be round or oval, and was at an estimated altitude of about 1000 to 1500 feet. It moved very slowly and disappeared into the distance. No sound was heard. The object was observed for about 10 minutes.

Lincoln, Wisconsin

On the night of July 29th, the object was seen on and off by many people passing through the   
northwest part of Lincoln. Wisconsin. This object appeared to be of a considerably bright color,   
and at times it appeared to be the size of a car. It would remain stationary for a period of time and   
then occasionally rise higher "to do U-turns" and other unusual motions in the sky.

30 JULY 1962
ILLINOIS (A/W)

AFRO BULLETIN - - - - - - - -March 1962
On 13 July 1962, at approximately 1900 hours, Ronald B. Berringer, who has 3000 flying time and a commercial pilot's rating, gave this account of his sighting. He states that on 12 July 1962, he was moving at about 1600 feet above the ground at about 125 mph, near Camp Lakota in Illinois on 13 July 1962. Approximately two minutes later, he noticed a brilliant orange object traveling at a much greater speed than any helicopter was capable of doing. The object just 3 have seen some operations being performed, such as raising and lowering the landing gear, because there was a jet of flame about 3/4 the size of the object itself. The raising and lowering operations did not appear to impede the object's speed at all. The speed was so great and the object so brilliant that I could observe no details at all. It simply appeared to come from the larger object and then rejoin it again. The full moon was shining and I had ample opportunity to make a good observation. The object was estimated to be at least 1000 feet above the ground. It made no noise that could be heard from the plane. The color was a brilliant orange and the shape was not round but elongated. No sonic boom was heard at this time. The object either slowed down dramatically or stopped moving altogether when it apparently joined the larger object, which then appeared to hover motionless. The motion and appearance was unlike anything I have ever seen operated.
