Memorandum for Record

Subj: Treatment of Civilian Caller

1. At approximately 2100 hours EDT, 4 July 1969, Sgt Zaperich, FTD Command Post Controller, took a phone call from a Mr. [redacted], Southgate, Kentucky. Mr. [redacted] thought that he might be witness to an Unidentified Flying Object, and asked if there was any known aircraft traffic in his area. Sgt Zaperich referred Mr. [redacted] to Wright Operations, suggesting that they might be able to answer his question about possible aircraft.

2. At approximately 2125 hours, Mrs. [redacted] called the FTD Command Post, and was extremely irate because of the treatment her husband had received from Wright Operations personnel. She related that a man who identified himself as Mr. [redacted] had suggested that Mr. [redacted] was under the influence of intoxicants, that perhaps he had been picnicking too much, and that he should forget the matter of UFO's. Mrs. [redacted] stated that both she and her husband had worked at their regular jobs on 4 July 1969, and that neither of them used any form of liquor, either on that day or as a normal practice.

3. AF Form 117, Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire, was completed at the request of Mrs. [redacted] by the Staff Duty Officer, and an apology was made for the behavior of Mr. [redacted].

4. It is recommended that the Commander, FTD, bring the alleged behavior of Mr. [redacted] to the attention of the Base Commander for his action. In the opinion of the Staff Duty Officer and his controller at the time, Sgt Zaperich, the reported behavior reflects ill upon the United States Air Force at a time when it can least afford adverse publicity in any area of endeavor.
