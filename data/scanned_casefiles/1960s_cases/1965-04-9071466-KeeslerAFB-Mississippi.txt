KEESLER AFB, MISSISSIPPI
4 APRIL 1965

The time of the sighting was approximately 0405 CST. The observer sighted a black oval object estimated to be 40 ft. long and appeared to be the shape of a football with four lights evenly spaced from one end to the other on the underside. The lights were all white and of high intensity and looked the same when they disappeared as when they appeared. At first the witness only noticed four lights, but when the object got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the cloud background. There was a cloud layer at 1200 ft, and the object was below these clouds. The lights were first seen at approximately 15° elevation and 200° - 230° azimuth, in the southwest. The object passed overhead and headed northeast prior to its disappearance. It faded into the clouds 15 - 20 seconds later at approximately 300° - 45° elevation and 050° azimuth. The observer did not venture a guess on speed but stated that it was fast. Witness stated that there wasn't any sound, trail or exhaust observed.

COMMENTS

The observer at first thought the object was an aircraft and he called FAA; they reported no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. A balloon has to be discarded as a possible explanation since the wind was from 180° and the object was mainly moving cross-wise to the wind. A possibility exists for a reflection off the clouds, but observer stated that the object was quite different. There was a searchlight in use four miles away from the area; however, it was not very bright and never been the cause of bright reflections (stated by the observer).

Another possible alternative is a satellite sighting. The lights were the same intensity as satellites, but observer states that the object was too low and had four lights rather than one.

With such available information the case is carried as unidentified. All alternatives are not substantiated with conclusive data to warrant a definite explanation.

Conversation of Dr J Allen Hynek and A2C Corum (A.N.), Weather Observer, Keesler AFB, Detachment 1452, Twenty-Fourth Weather Squadron (MATS) regarding his observation on 4 Apr 65/1005z.

Corum was not aware of the fact that two naval air station personnel reported an observation 1/2 hour earlier; they saw a ball of flame.

Corum saw four white lights, they came in overhead, from Northwest and went Northeast. Cloud layer was 1200 feet and objects were below these. Scattered conditions, 5/10 thick to broke, varied. Object passed underneath the clouds, at the northeast 1/4 faded into clouds, went almost straight north, faded into cloud and then came back. Obj seemed to stay at same level, speed did not vary, Corum did not attempt to estimate speed, it was going east. At beginning it was approximately 1/5 degrees altitude, azimuth 200-220, passed just to the North of zenith, and disappeared at 30-35 degrees altitude 050 az. This gave object a total run of about 90 degrees.

Estimated time of observation as five to ten seconds. When he first saw object he called another observer, it was no longer visible when he came. When Dr Rynek asked Corum to re-enact the sighting for time, the time elapsed was seventeen seconds, coming to the conclusion that actually observation was 15-20 seconds. Then obj got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the cloud background.

Corum was asked if this might have been searchlights on the clouds. Reply "Never saw four searchlights like that." He didn't hear any sound, doesn't know where there would be searchlights like this. Light off water tower often reflects off the clouds, but this was quite different, he said. Still didn't think they were searchlights, there was no reflection. Lights were of high intensity, looked the same when they disappeared as when they appeared. Almost the same intensity as the satellites, kind of bright but not very bright at all, saw four lights. Was not a satellite, too low, and four lights rather than one.

Asked Corum if he had any idea as to what he saw. Replied that he was worried because he could't figure out what it was. Asked if he could compare it to anything and place it up in the air? "A large football with lights, this might look like what I saw." The outline was darker than the clouds and the object was dark except the lights, which were on the bottom, and were probably protruding from the object. All were white lights, no difference in intensity of lights, and lights did not twinkle. Compared to a street light that was on. Same intensity of street light which was approximately 120 yards away from weather tower.

Corum never saw anything that resembled it, was shaken up, first thought it was an aircraft and called FAA and they had no a/c in the vicinity at the time. Keesler has no flying at night, unless it would be Coast Guard a/c, everything on flight line is quite between 10pm and 6pm. And there was no sound.

Asked him if he knew of any searchlights in area, one report had mentioned searchlights in shopping centers. Told us that it wasn't a shopping center but at the Broadwater Hotel four miles away, they are not very bright and have never given bright reflections, not even as bright as the water tower which is 1/2 mile away.

Regarding angular separation: Thumb at arms' length did not cover the front and end lights. Lights were arranged one on each end, evenly spaced with two in the middle. Wind from 160 deg., Obj moving largely crossway to wind. Moonlight at times, only one layer of clouds for he could see stars sometimes.

KEESLER AFB, MISSISSIPPI
4 APRIL 1965

The time of the sighting was approximately 4:40 am, CST. The observer sighted a black oval object estimated to be 40 ft. long and appeared to be the shape of a football with four lights evenly spaced from one end to the other on the underside. The lights were all white and of high intensity and looked the same when they disappeared as when they appeared. (The intensity was compared to that of a satellite but the object was not a satellite because it was too low and four lights rather than one. At first the observer saw only the four lights, but when the object got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the cloud background. There was a cloud layer at 1200 ft. and the object was below these clouds. The observer first saw the lights at approximately 45 degrees elevation and 200 - 230 degrees azimuth, in the southwest. The object passed overhead and headed northeast. It faded into the clouds 15 - 20 seconds later at approximately 30-45 degrees elevation and 070 degrees azimuth. This would make a total run of 90 degrees. The observer did not venture a guess on speed but stated that it was fast. Also, no sound was heard and no trail or exhaust was observed.

COMMENTS:
The observer at first thought the object was an aircraft and he called FAA and they had no aircraft in the vicinity at the time. Keesler has no flying at night, unless it would be a Coast Guard aircraft, everything on the flight line is quiet between 10 pm and 5 am.

A balloon has to be ruled out since the wind was from 130 degrees and the object moving largely cross way to wind.

One possibility is a reflection of searchlights off the clouds, light of a water tower, which is 3 miles away, often reflects off the clouds. However, the observer stated that the object was quite different. Also there was a

searchlight in use four miles away but they are not very bright and have
never given bright reflections, not even as bright as the water tower.
Therefore, the case is carried as UNIDENTIFIED.
