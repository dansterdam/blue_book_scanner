KEESLER AFB, MISSISSIPPI  
4 APRIL 1965

The time of the sighting was approximately 0405 GST. The observer sighted a black oblong object similar in size to a football with four lights evenly spaced from one end to the other on the same underside. The lights were still, and of high intensity, and looked like the video as seen on the television. There were no wings, but when the object got closer, it looked like a dark oval, darker than the background. The object passed overhead and descended to about 1000 feet and then ascended to about 2000 feet in the southwest. The object passed overhead and descended to about 1000 feet and then ascended to about 2000 feet in the southwest. The object was as big as the moon, 15-20 feet in diameter. The witness stated that the object did not emit any sound, and he stated that it was fast. Witness related that there wasn't any trail or exhaust observed.

COMMENTS

FAA: The observer at first thought the object was an aircraft, and he called FAA. The FAA station has no record of the sighting. A radar check indicated no targets in the area at the time of the sighting. A telephone check with control tower at Keesler indicated they had no information on the sighting. This witness stated that the object was quite different from any aircraft he had ever before seen. There was a searchlight in use four miles away from the witness, and this may have had some effect, but it never before seen this type of object.

Another possible alternative is a satellite sighting. The lights were the same color and had four lights rather than one, and had four lights rather than one. With such available information, the case is carried as unidentified. All alternatives are not substantiated with conclusive data to warrant a definite explanation.

Conversation of Dr J Allen Hynek and A2C Corum (A.N.), Weather Observer, Keesler AFB, Detachment #20, Twenty-Fourth Weather Squadron (MATS) regarding his observation on 5/10/1952. 

Corum was not aware of the fact that two naval air station personnel reported an observation of white lights. They came in overhead, from Southwest and went Northeast. Corum saw four white lights, they came in overhead, from Southwest and went Northeast around 6700-8000 feet and were under cirriostratus. As the lights were fading into the northeast it faded into the clouds, went almost straight north, and then went into cloud and were lost to sight. Corum stated the lights were at an estimated 45 degrees altitude, azimuth 200-250 degrees, passed just to the North of zenith. The duration of the sighting was 7 to 8 seconds.

When the first object was called another observer, it was no longer visible when the same object was again sighted for a second time. The time elapsed between the first sighting and the second sighting was 15-22 seconds. When object got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the surroundings.

Corum was asked if this might have been searchlights on the clouds. He replied they didn't know of any searchlights like this, and weren't any water tower reflections which could distort the lights. The lights off water tower often reflects and looks almost the same when they disappeared as when they appeared, almost the same intensity as when they disappeared. The motion appeared to be a straight line path and then disappeared.

Corum was asked if he had any idea as to what he saw. He replied that he was worried as to what he could compare it to, and placed it up in the air, a large football with lights. This might look like a large searchlight calibration, could be described as an oval probably reflecting from the object. All were white lights, no difference in the intensity of the lights. He could not remember if the lights were blinking or rotating.

Corum never saw anything that resembled it. He thought it was an unknown. First thought it was an aircraft, but there was no sound or flashing lights. It seems between lights and weather conditions that night, Keesler has no flying at night, unless it would be Coast Guard a/c, everything on flight line grounded that night.

The text in the document is as follows:

KEESFTER AP., MISSISSIPPI  
6 APRIL 1965

The time of the sighting was approximately 12:00 a.m. The observer sighted a black oval object estimated to be 40 ft. long and appeared to be the shape of a football with four lights spaced from one end to the other on the underside. The lights were all white and of high intensity and looked the same when they disappeared as when they appeared. The intensity was compared to that of a searchlight but this was not a satellite because it was too low and four lights rather than one. At first the observer thought it was the four lights, but when the object got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the cloud background. Under this was a single layer as though it were a semicircle. The observer first saw the lights at approximately 45 degrees elevation and 200 - 300 degrees azimuth. In the southwest the object passed overhead and passed southeast at 40 to 45 degrees elevation.

The observer at first thought the object was an aircraft and he called SAC and they had no flying at night, unless it would be a Coast Guard aircraft, everything on the flight line is from 10 pm and 5 am. 

The wind at the time was from 130 degrees and the object moving largely across the wind.

The possibility is a reflection of searchlights off the clouds. The light of a searchlight which is 1 mile away, often reflects over the clouds. However, an observer noticed that the object was solid structure. Also, there was a noise.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of text from an old UFO report document. The image shows a handwritten text that discusses the characteristics of some unspecified objects, mentioning that they are "searchlights in use" and that they are "not very bright and have never given bright reflections, not even as bright as the water tower".

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image, the output is:

"searchlights in use four miles away but they are not very bright and have never given bright reflections, not even as bright as the water tower. Therefore, the case is classified as unidentified."
