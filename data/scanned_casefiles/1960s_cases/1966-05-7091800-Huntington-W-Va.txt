Dear Sir,

I have read lately about your Project Blue Book on UFOs. I am very, very interested in this matter.

I am asking you to give me some particulars and picture on a bit of your UFOs. We a make of that.

I have some clues that will help me solve the sky (its path).

I stopped at the a light that off flight right at this site. But it was willing blot on delicate 11 No. 11 was very clear across the Ohio Bridge, the time was about 9:08, 20. I hurried down to the city of children.

P.S. Because of my job of my UFO, I can not give it out as in the newspapers or any other of a kind. If you would like.
