[Handwritten text, partially obscured/blacked out in some areas]

In regards to the object in question, I cannot recall with any precision as reported to suggest. The object was brought to my attention by a telephone. I was from nine 13, 1967 approximately 11:00 PM. Made a statement at that time, and while in the investigation, that I saw a formation, such that we used to communicate a general opinion, if the known so. This line showing with it appeared to be approximately 250 in diameter and I made a study to the north west, just at the top of the trees, I distinctly saw it again... was close to me about 45 degrees. When seen no very exactly could be anything else substantiating about it.

h. Remarks
The above report was copied by unit Command Post and I was notified as per their instructions if object is still visible or there are photos available. Following the instructions as per the location of the object I observed the star Arcturus, bright with a slightly reddish-orange tint to it. This was the only object to fit the description that I was able to see. I performed my observation for approximately 30 minutes (with my wife an interested observer - "I always wanted to see how you professional investigators operate") and neither of us saw a moving object. Upon starting at Arcturus for some time, we were both convinced that it was moving, however, after taking our eyes away for a couple of seconds and then returning to it, it was still there. I am quite convinced that this is what the observer saw - the sky was completely clear and there were literally thousands of visible bodies.

The time at which he made his observation does not correspond to zenith transit of Arcturus and it would transit from East to West, but I have to other explanation. I am forwarding this report in the chance that if there was some other object that I did not observe, it may have been reported by some other station.

Contact was made with Lt. Liles, Corpus Christi NAS, Texas in regards to a sighting of a UFO. Liles number is 733-1790 ext. 341. He was called The NAS to report an object traveling down the coastline. He then called back to report that the object had turned 180 degrees and was now heading up the coastline. Shortly after that the Navy pilot called in his sighting of an object going up the coastline. Then the third civilian called in his sighting. It was also traveling up the coast. The pilot said that the object looked like it was level with his craft which was flying at 6000 feet. There was no radar contact made with the object or objects. Nothing unusual appeared on radar. There was a later report came in from Kingsville NAS in the south of Corpus Christi NAS. The report was of an object traveling up the coast. This sighting did occur before the other sightings. At approximately 2130 hours.

Investigation revealed that Echo I and Echo II were in the area at the time of the sightings. Echo I was over 914-35N at approximately 0308Z traveling toward the SE. Echo II was in the area of 914-30N at approximately 024.9Z traveling toward the south.

At the time of the sighting, 2200 CDT 14 July 1967, I was on a return flight from Little Rock AFB to NAS Corpus Christi. The following information is listed as pertinent to the flight:

Aircraft:           C-117D, BUNO 39061
Flight Plan:        Instrument Flight Rules
Position:           038° Radial/21 NM Palacios VORTAC
Altitude:           6,000 ft. (Indicated)
Altimeter Setting:  30.07" HG.
Heading:            218° magnetic
True Airspeed:      170 kts.
Ground Speed:       182 kts.
Wind at 6,000 ft:   030°/20 (estimated)

The object appeared ahead of the aircraft and traveled across our flight path from left to right on an estimated heading of Northwest, beginning at an elevation about 60° and ending about 10°, in a slightly curved flight path. Due to the brightness and size of the object I do not consider that it could have been been a meteor, but. It can best be described as a meteor, burning out as it reached an elevation of about - 10° ahead of our aircraft. Upon landing at NAS Corpus Christi, we did not initially report the sighting, but, when talking to the NAS Corpus Christi Operations Duty Officer found that he was compiling information on a sighting received from several ground observers in the Corpus Christi area, who had reported the sighting as being Northeast of Corpus Christi about the same time as we had observed it (2200 CDT).
