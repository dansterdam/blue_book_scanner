Attn: Major H. Quintanilla, Jr.                        Re: UFO of 18 December 1966, Bear Mt.
                                                        State Park, New York. Evaluated
                                                        originally as hoax.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

On re-examination, I find no substantiation for the evaluation of hoax, particularly in view of the photo-analysis report, No. 67-10, dated 20 Feb-ruary 1967, which contains no information upon which a hoax can be based.

To the contrary, the report states that close examination of the negative has negated double exposure and/or retouching. The photographs appear genuine insofar as content is concerned, however, no satisfactory explanation of the unidentified object could be made. The lack of a satisfactory explanation of the unidentified does not constitute sufficient reason to declare it a hoax. Further, the interviewer considered the witness to be a "reliable source".

After examination of the print by myself and by Mr. ████ of the University of Chicago, we feel that the original negative should be requested for further examination. Mr. ████, a qualified photo-analyst, disagrees with the photo analysis presented in the report as to the distance of the object. He points out that the depth of field extends much farther than indicated in the report. It will be noted, from the print, that the focus is poor in the entire periphery of the picture regardless of the distance; only in the center of the picture is the focus good, extending essentially to infinity. Consequently no judgment can be made as to the real size of the object, if this judgment is based solely on the quality of focus.

My recommendation is, therefore, that the evaluation by changed from hoax to unidentified.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

SUBJECT                 UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION                Lake Tiorati, Bear Mountain State Park, New York    DATE 18 December 1966

P NRS    1 negative, 2 prints (B&W)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request submitted by Major Quintanilla (TDSTR) to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the negative has negated double exposure and/or retouching. The photographs appear genuine insofar as content is concerned, however, no satisfactory explanation could be made of the unidentified object. The object appears to be circular in plan form, basically flat in cross section with a domed "superstructure". The object appears to be situated beyond the foreground trees, indicating a diameter in excess of eight inches, and the relative clarity indicates it to be substantially nearer than the background trees.

The object could have a diameter great as two or three feet. No attempt at "panning" was indicated as is evidenced by the sharpness of the general scene. The object exhibits some small degree of blurriness indicating motion, the direction of which could not be ascertained.

SAP-CIO/Mrs Cassel/br/7987/9/21 Apr 66

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Your photographs were forwarded to experts for a comprehensive evaluation. They found that the object appeared to be circular, basically flat in cross section with a domed "superstructure". The object was situated some 15 feet above the foreground trees, indicating a diameter in excess of eight inches; the relative clarity indicates it to be substantially nearer than the background trees. The object could have a diameter as great as two or three feet. The object exhibited some small degree of blurring indicating motion, the direction of which could not be ascertained.

The photographs do not substantiate the statement regarding the relative size of the object to be "very big". The object photographed was a maximum of three feet in diameter.

No other UFO reports were received from the northeastern part of the United States on December 18, 1966.

Thank you for submitting your observation to the Air Force for evaluation.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
