Dear [redacted]

Your Observation of 9 August 1965 is characteristic of re-entry of space debris into the earth's atmosphere. However no major object re-entered during this time. There are many smaller components of space debris on which a plot or track is not made. It is quite likely that you observed the re-entry of one of these smaller fragments.

Sincerely,

suggested reply:

a. Dear

Your recent sighting of 9 August 1965 is characteristic
of re-entry of space debris into the earth's atmosphere, however,
no major object re-entered during this time. There are many
smaller components of so called space junk on which a plot or
track is not made. It is quite likely that you observed the
re-entry of one of these smaller fragments.

Dear Sir:

On August 9th at approximately 9:30 P.M., I was sitting on my patio in the Hollywood Hills with my wife, my son, my step-son and a friend. I was looking through my Japanese telescope at the moon and the stars, being that it was an exceptionally clear night.

I looked away from the moon and yelled "there goes a falling star". However, it was not a falling star, as it did not dissipate as a falling star does. I put the telescope scope on it and it was like a big orange ball of fire as it crossed the horizon from the moon at a tremendous speed. It leveled off and went straight into the horizon. I watched it through the telescope for approximately 2 minutes. It did not change its direction or shape at any time -- it was just a round ball of fire.

I had thought perhaps it was a satellite, but could get no confirmation of same. I have always been a skeptic with regards to UFO, however, if this was not a satellite, it certainly was a UFO.

There were many airplanes in the sky above Los Angeles this night and you can be assured that this was not an airplane.

Very truly yours,

HB/bd
