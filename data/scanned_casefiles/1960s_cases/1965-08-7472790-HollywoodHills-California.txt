SEPT 5 1965

Your observation of 9 August 1965 is characteristic of many reports received by this office. The description of the object as a silvery, semi-transparent, cigar-shaped object which appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet long and 10-12 feet wide is typical of many such reports. The fact that it was observed to be revolving or spinning as it moved across the sky is also common to many UFO reports. The speed and altitude at which the object was observed is likewise within the ranges frequently reported.

While the object you observed may have been of an unusual nature, most such reports can be explained as misidentifications of known aerial objects or phenomena. Since we have no physical evidence or further information about the object you observed, we are unable to arrive at a definite conclusion as to its identity.

Sincerely,

Reference the attached letter from ____ requesting information on an UFO sighting of 9 Aug 65. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear ____

Your recent sighting of 9 August 1965 is characteristic of many reports we receive. It tends to indicate an atmosphere of abnormal activity in the area, however, any major objects reported during this period usually have a satisfactory conventional explanation. A detailed track is not made. It is quite likely that you observed the remnants of one of these smaller fragments.

Dear Sirs:

On August 9th at approximately 9:30 P.M. I was sitting on my patio in Hollywood Hills with my wife, my son, and my step-son and a friend. We were looking through my binoculars at the moon and the stars. Suddenly we noticed a strange object crossing the sky. It seemed to be moving at a tremendous speed.

I looked at it with my field glasses and yellow "there goes a falling star". However, it was not a falling star, as it did not disappear but got closer and closer to the horizon. It then crossed the horizon at a tremendous speed.

I watched it through the telescope for approximately 2 minutes. It looked just like a satellite, but could be directed at will. I have always been a skeptic with regard to UFOs, however, if this was not a satellite, it certainly was a UFO.

There were many airplanes in the sky above Los Angeles this night and you can be assured that this was not an airplane.

Yours truly,
