9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj observed visually about 50 mi S of Minot AFB by civilian pilot. Ground Radar picked up obj. Obj appeared as a light about 3,000 ft below a/c at 7,000 ft. Seemed to be following a/c. Radar at Minot (GCA) reported that an obj bearing 160 deg az was moving outbound and appeared to be orbiting in a five mile circle proceeding inbound toward station and then disappearing from scope.

11. COMMENTS
Unresolved and visual target not same. Reporting a/c 50 mi from base. Motion of radar target different from reported activity of air vis obj. Insufficient data for evaluation of air vis target. Radar return not complete, however pattern is consistent with a/c return. Odd radar return inbound, inversion at 16,000-17,000 may have effects on return. Radar portion cont-

EVALUATION OF UFO AT MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, 29 APR 64

Propagation anomalies and equipment malfunction can be ruled out since the target was observed both visually and by the radar.

The position of the target reported by the ground radar and the air visual report place it in the proximity of Minot International Airport, also, its speed and altitude are compatible with aircraft.

It appears that the most likely cause of the radar returns would be an aircraft, possibly waiting to land. This seems reasonable when the target's position, coupled with altitude and maneuvers performed are considered. The lights observed could be attributed to the aircraft's landing lights. The fact that no aircraft had been reported to be a civil aircraft, which would not report to Minot AFB, and for some reason did not report into the international airport.
