Dear Sirs:

The following are notes which I made of a certain object in the atmosphere and which looked to be fairly close, (several miles)

Nov. 24, '66 about 8:50'52 P.M., bright light blue (about color of cone in gas flame), took about 2-sec. to cross 27Â° diagonally a window pane, I was sitting about 11' from window. Object was from 6 to 7 inches in dia. perfectly round, had saddish-orange streaks in rear ending at a point about 2' in rear. Paint XXXXX on radio. I was looking almost directly north (magnetic); object was traveling from an easterly direction to westerly about 20 degrees from vertical. (downward)

Very truly yours,
