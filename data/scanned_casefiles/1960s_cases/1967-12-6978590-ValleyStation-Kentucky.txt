(BALLOON, WEATHER)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a bright light similar to a star or white recognition light on an aircraft that traveled in an erratic flight path. It passed through some thin layers of clouds, grew dim and finally disappeared.

COMMENTS: A weather balloon was launched from a nearby weather station at 0018 hrs. The observer did not think he saw the balloon because surface winds were blowing toward the SW and the object he saw traveled toward the ENE. However at 6,000 ft the wind was ENE and at 10,000 ft was blowing ENE. This type of balloon can be seen to about 10,000 ft and ascends at about 1,000 ft minute.

INDICATE WITH OTHER OBSERVATIONS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.
It (the object) appeared to be a point of light with (fuzzy) edges. Due to darkness and low cloud cover (3500 feet) overhead, which the object passed through in lower extremities causing a dimming effect, but never completely hiding the object.

The object was definitely self-luminous and gave off a white light.

Shape of the object is unknown, but is believed to be solid.

The only comparable objects I know which would be close are either a large star or a white recognition light on aircraft, but due to its very erratic flight pattern it could not possibly have been one or the other.

27. Information which I feel is pertinent but is not adequately covered in this questionnaire, alternatively provide narrative explanation of the sighting.

I was at the Twilight drive in theatre, Louisville, Kentucky, facing West, looking at the screen, when at 00126 hrs, 12/10/67, I and I spotted a light moving in a peculiar flight pattern and on a bearing of 70 degrees East Northeast at approximately 3500ft. It came into view at approximately 30 degrees elevation approaching us at a height rate of speed, and flying in a spiral or barrel role pattern. As it passed overhead it appeared to slow or stop frequently than resume speed and course. The object continued overhead and upon reaching 120 degrees from the Western horizon or 60 degrees from the Eastern horizon it put on a sudden burst of speed and proceeded upward and directly away from us on an angle of approximately 60 degrees from the Eastern horizon, growing dimmer and smaller until disappearing in to the overcast, at approximately 3500 ft.

The atmospheric conditions on the night of 12/9/67, and the morning of 12/10/67, were as follows: Cloudless completely overcast with light rain and mist. At time of sighting no rain was falling. Overcast was at 3500 ft. Wind was from the Northeast at 4 knots (5mph)

The object was in view approximately (2½) two and one half minutes, disappearing at 00:28 ½.

As the object moved across the sky, it occasionally passed through the lower layer of the cloud cover, causing it to dim but never completely disappearing.

The object appeared as a large star, or miniature self-luminous ball which would have been completely hidden by a matchhead held at arms length.

Upon seeing the object disappear I proceeded to a public phone and called the traffic control tower at Standiford Field and asked about aircraft in the area. I was told that nothing was on the radar screen and nothing was in communication with the tower at that time (12:30) or for a time previous. I asked if there were any weather balloons up and was told, "Nothing, no radar and no weather balloons were launched."

The man I was talking to told me to contact Wright-Patterson AFB and file a report. Upon hanging up, I did so. The officer I talked to, took a full report and my name and phone number and said that he would contact me later as this call was at my expense, ($2.20).

He called my home at approximately 01:15 hrs, and spoke with my father as I was not home at that time. He said that he would call back later on. At approximately 01:41 hrs he called again.


- page 17 -

The officer asked questions similar to those he had asked the first time we talked, and proceeded to go over the same questions for the second and third time. No task will be available to me at the time and said I would receive a form to fill out and return to the base. We finished talking at approximately 02:25 hrs, and hung up.

At 13:05 hrs, 12/10/67, [redacted] and I arrived at Standiford Field and spoke with the man in charge of the Weather Bureau. He gave us the information we requested pertaining to the area in which we made the sighting (3/4 mile north of the field). When we asked about air-craft in the area, we were informed that mysterious weather balloon had been launched at 00:18 hrs. Why this balloon had not been known about the night before or why it had not shown up on Radar just a few minutes after its launch, or why it was not reported to me when I asked about it.

I was told however, that the wind was out of the Northeast at 4kts. This would be blowing the balloon almost the opposite direction from which to object I reported came, and at more friction or the speed I indicated the object was traveling. Although my calculation may have been just a calculation, it could not have been that far off.

I went back to my location at the time of the sighting and took along my bi-noculars, a map of the area, a compass and protractor with which I plotted my exact position, that of where I first sighted the object and last sighted the object, relation to Standiford Field, plus the facts I got at the air-field and put them on the map. (this map is attached to these forms.)

I have concluded that the object I sighted could not possibly have been the uncertain balloon launched at 00:18 hrs.

Due to a bad accident to my right hand I was unable to get this report returned to you any sooner.

WEATHER BALLOON INFO. AS GIVEN BY SGT. COLEMAN
IN THE METEOROLOGY SECT.

Weather balloons are about 6to 8 ft. in diameter at launch.

At burst altitudes they may be between 35 and 40 ft. in diameter.

The burst alt. for the modern ones is usually over 100,000 ft.

They are usually launched 4min. before 0000, 0600, 1200, and
1800 hrs. zulu.

The time of flight of these balloons is usually 1 to 2 hrs.

The payloads are returned to earth on a small parachute.

Sometimes at night the operator attaches a small light to
the payload. This light is usually attached by a string to the
payload, and can be seen to about 10,000 ft.

THE RATE OF CLIMB OF THESE BALLOONS IS ABOUT 1,000 FT. PER MIN.
