Dear Sir:

Last Friday I received a phone call from Dr. J. A. Hynek, Director, Astronomical Observatory, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. We have agreed upon the mutually satisfactory date of April 4th, the earlier date suitable to Dr. Hynek having already been fulfilled.

I earnestly want to convey to you my sincere thanks for your very excellent assistance in arranging for Dr. Hynek's appearance in Troy and, speaking for our entire rotary group, extend to you an invitation to visit us as our guest whenever you are in our area. In fact, if you could advise me before hand of your schedule, we would be most interested in hearing from you about your work or on any other subject of your reference. Should you be in the area on April 4th in particular, I would be most pleased to have you join us.

Thank you again for the discerning interest you have given to our request.

Sincerely yours,
THE GUMMED PRODUCTS COMPANY

NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
DEABORN OBSERVATORY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

January 30, 1961

Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
Pentagon
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Colonel Tacker:

This is in reply to your letter of 9 January. I am sure that you would agree that I could hardly afford the time to make a special trip from Chicago to Troy for the purpose of a noon luncheon. Even were there a very handsome honorarium, I would still hesitate taking that much time from my professional life for these public relations purposes. However, should it so happen that Major Friend calls me for consultation on one of these dates, and if this requested talk were considered a part of my consulting services, I would be happy to be of service.

As I recollect, Troy is not too far from the base and if transportation could be supplied from the base to Troy and back again I would be happy to be of service to you and to the Rotarians.

I am sure that you understand my position; I simply could not justify in my own conscience spending that much time solely for the purpose of giving a popular talk.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
JAH/mdp

P.S. Apologize for the lateness. I have been away quite a while and only recently took up the correspondence. H.M.

Dear Mr. Heise:

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter
of 4 January requesting a speaker for the Troy Rotary Club
during the month of February on the subject of unidentified
flying objects.

I am endeavoring to obtain a suitable speaker for you
on this subject for one of the open dates mentioned in your
letter, and I will let you know as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

SAFOI-ELTCOL TUCKER/MBB/72291

9 January 1961

Dear Doctor Hynek:

I am enclosing a letter from the Troy, Ohio Rotary Club requesting assistance in February on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

If you can possibly do so, I would like to have you speak to this group. As a University scientist supporting the Air Force position, I think you would carry a great deal more weight than some member of the Air Force.

If you can handle this one, would you contact Mr. Heiss direct and let me know?

Sincerely,

This document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter from The Gummed Products Company in Troy, Ohio, dated January 4, 1961. The text of the letter is as follows:

Lt. Col. Lawrence J. Parker
Intelligence, Headquarters and Rocks Branch
Office of Secretary, Dept. of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last summer I saw a television program while I was vacationing in Michigan, which emanated from Lansing, Ann Arbor or Kalamazoo, Michigan and which dealt with the subject of unidentified flying objects. This was a program sponsored by the Air Force for public information. It was extremely interesting and brought to the account included the observation of our own Wright-Patterson A.F. Base Personnel. The Project was referred to as Project "Blue Book".

I have contacted the "field" in Dayton on this subject and have been referred to you. I would like to obtain copies of any films - either motion picture or stills - to talk to us about this subject. Last year we were given a very interesting account of this subject and we would be able to advise or assist someone from Dayton to speak to us on this subject if you would give us a February 21st or 22nd, 12:00 o'clock noon, with the program starting at approximately 12:00 and lasting about 50 - 100 Rotarians and guests in attendance from this area.

May I have an early reply and please be assured that we will appreciate your assistance in this matter or any suggestion for a program of this nature from Wright-Patterson A.F. Base.

Yours truly,
THE GUMMED PRODUCTS COMPANY
