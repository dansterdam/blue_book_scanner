I earnestly want to convey to you my sincere thanks for your very excellent assistance in arranging for Dr. Hynek's appearance in Troy and speaking for our entire Rotary group, extended to you an invitation to visit us as our guest whenever you are in our area. In fact, if you could advise me before hand, we would be very pleased to reserve a date for you to appear on our program schedule. We would be most interested in hearing from you about your work or on any other subject of your preference.

NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

January 30, 1961

Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
Pentagon
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Colonel Tacker:

This is in reply to your letter of 9 January. I am sure that you would agree that I could hardly afford the time to make a special trip from Chicago to Troy for the purpose of a noon luncheon. Even were there a very handsome honorarium, I would still hesitate taking that much time from my professional life for these public relations purposes. However, should it so happen that Major Friend calls me for consultation on one of those dates, and if this request talk were considered a part of my consulting service, I expect it could be arranged.

As I recollect, Troy is not too far from the base and if transportation could be supplied from the base to Troy and back again to the base, I would be happy to be of service to you and to the Rotarians.

I am sure that you understand my position; I simply could not justify in my own conscience spending that much time solely for the purpose of giving a popular talk.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

Dear Mr. Heise:

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 4 January requesting a speaker for the Troy Rotary Club during the month of February on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

I am endeavoring to obtain a suitable speaker for you on this subject for one of the open date mentioned in your letter, and I will let you know as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

9 January 1961

Dear Doctor Hynek:

I am inclosing a letter from the Troy, Ohio Rotary Club requesting a speaker in February on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

If you can possibly do so, I would like to have you speak to this group. As a University scientist supporting the Air Force position, I think you would carry a great deal more weight than some member of the Air Force.

If you can handle this one, would you contact Mr. Heise direct and let me know?

Sincerely,

TROY, OHIO

St.Regis                                                                 January 4, 1961

Dear Sir:

Last summer I saw a television program while I was vacationing in Michigan, which emanated from Lansing, Ann Arbor or Kalamazoo, Michigan and which dealt with the subject of unidentified flying objects. This was filmed presentation and was issued as an official Government release, I believe under auspices of the Air Force for public information. It was extremely interesting and a good portion of the account included the observation of our own Wright-Patterson A.F. Base Personnel. The Project was referred to as Project "Blue Book".

I have contacted the "field" in Dayton on this subject and have been referred to you by Technical Sergeant Bolidu. As Program Chairman of our local Rotary Club for February, I had hoped to be able to line up a speaker with or without films - to talk to us about this subject. Last year we were given a very interesting account of the SAC operation and Sgt. Bolidu indicated that you might be able to advise us or assign someone from Dayton to speak to us on this subject.

The open dates are February 14th, 21st or 28th. It is a luncheon meeting at 12:00 o'clock noon, with the program starting at approximately 12:40 and lasting on the average of 45 minutes, more-or-less, but usually more. As a rule there are about 90 - 100 Rotarians and guests in attendance from this area.

May I have an early reply and please be assured that we will appreciate your assistance in this matter or a suggestion for a program of this nature from Wright-Patterson A.F. Base.

Yours truly,
THE GUNMED PRODUCTS COMPANY

Research Director
