Ltr, TD-3, 25 Oct 61, Request for Analysis of Filmstrip
1st Ind (TD-4a)                                                                  20 Nov 61

TO: TD-3 (Major Friend)

1. The examination of the film has produced these findings.

    a. In addition to the bright ellipse, a similar separate
    faint image also appears in most frames. This is the only
    feature that is duplicated in the format.

    b. These images change position within the frame in a
    uniform manner while maintaining their same position relative
    to each other.

    c. The background also changes position within the frame
    but at a different rate.

2. Analysis of the report reveals the following:

    a. The gun was very high and slightly aft of the direc-
    tion of flight.

    b. The camera was aimed to the left and in a downward
    manner.

3. The only explanation we can offer is that the images
were caused by the reflection of a round window or light
within the aircraft. Such reflections on a double pane
window would produce a double image.
