PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 8-11-1960
2. LOCATION: Danbury, Conn.
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2050
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: 1 Ground-Radar
5. SOURCE: CAFTI
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 25 min.
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: Northeast to Southwest
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object was round, pinkish-orange in color, glowing, and traveling at a high rate of speed. It was observed by radar at a distance of approx 35 miles. Then sighting was in agreement with visual observation at nearby Mt. Catrigali.
11. COMMENTS: Suggestion responsible for this sighting was probably "ball lightning". It was described as a round shape with a reddish-orange glow, quite brilliant, and moving rapidly at an altitude of around 35,000 ft. This phenomenon can be fit in the sidereal description given by the witness. Disappearation of lightning may occur due to change of temperature which causes a color change, and an explosion may occur which causes the phenomenon to disappear. This is a doubtful case regarding the nature of the observation.

NO MOTION AT ALL

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

ESTIMATED 1/2 TO 3/4 OF FULL MOON

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the known object would the size of the sighting have covered?

A MATCH NO WIDER

IT APPEARED TO FADE FROM VIEW AND THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. IT MADE NO SOUND AND THERE WERE NO TRAILS OR EXHAUST VISIBLE. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH MANY STARS VISIBLE SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THE OBJECT VERY CLEARLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED.

CAPTAIN THOMAS L. CAREY, USAF
ASSISTANT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
HEADQUARTERS, AIR FORCE CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH LABORATORIES
BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
REFERENCE: YOUR LETTER DATED 11 OCTOBER 1961

I CAN ADD LITTLE TO THE REPORT I SUBMITTED A YEAR AGO IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE OBJECT I SAW THAT NIGHT SEEMED TO BE INTELLIGENTLY OPERATED, THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT NATURE OR SIZE. IT APPEARED TO BE ALMOST CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH SOME KIND OF CENTRAL LIGHT OR ILLUMINATION.

SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO DISCUSS THIS INCIDENT WITH SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ALSO OBSERVERS, AND THEY HAVE CONFIRMED MY OWN OBSERVATIONS. HOWEVER, NONE OF US WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE TRUE NATURE OF THE OBJECT. WE WERE ALL, QUITE FRANKLY, MYSTIFIED BY WHAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT.

I HOPE THIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION IS HELPFUL, AND I WILL BE GLAD TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA I CAN, SHOULD YOU REQUIRE IT.

SINCERELY, 
THOMAS L. CAREY

Transcription of text:
"STATEMENT OF WITNESS
Shortly after daylight on the morning of Sept. the 3rd 1961, I went to the rear of my home to feed 2 dogs. As I was returning to the house I happened to look up and saw an object in the sky which at first I thought was an airplane. However, as I watched it, I saw that it was no plane but rather some kind of mysterious aircraft. It appeared to be about the size of a small car and was circular in shape and of a bright silver or light metallic color. It was hovering motionless in the sky at an estimated altitude of around 1,000 to 1,500 feet. I watched it for several minutes and it never moved from its position. As I continued to observe it, I noticed that it appeared to be surrounded by a faint halo or glow. Suddenly, without any apparent propulsion or sound, the object took off at a tremendous speed in a horizontal direction and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I was completely amazed and puzzled by what I had seen.
Description of Object:
(1) No visible means of propulsion.
(2) Circular in shape, approx. 20-25 ft. in diameter.
(3) Bright silver or light metallic color.
(4) Surrounded by a faint halo or glow.
(5) Hovered motionless, then took off at tremendous speed in a horizontal direction and disappeared.
(6) No sound was heard.
Yours truly,
[Signature]"

During the elapsed period of time I have somehow misplaced your enclosed envelope. would it be possible for your office to forward it?
