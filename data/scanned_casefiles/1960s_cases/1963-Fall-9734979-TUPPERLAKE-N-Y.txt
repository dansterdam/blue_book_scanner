There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a project Blue Book record card, containing various fields such as "Date," "Observations Group," "Type of Observation," and "Conclusions." The record card seems to be for an incident that occurred in the fall of 1963.

Dear

Enclosed is the photograph with negative which you furnished to the Air Force for analysis.

A laboratory analysis indicates a positive explanation for this light phenomenon. The light appears to be caused by the reflection of the moon on the surface of the lake, which would in all probability result in the formation caused.

We are returning your photograph and negative as you requested.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

a. The light streak located in approximately the middle of the negative is the cause of your inquiry.

Transcription of the text in the image:

The object I am reporting was of a brilliant white color, oval in shape. It appeared from the north and was traveling in a southerly direction. It passed directly over my car, which was stopped at the time, at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. It was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared into the distance. There was no sound or trail of any kind. The night was clear and the moon was nearly full.

Dear Sir:

Thanks for sending LIFE your picture of an unusual cloud formation, which you said a friend witnessed. We're sorry we can't use the picture. There's a rule in the magazine that we can't print anything that might be interpreted as a flying saucer, but we can't say exactly what it is.

We're returning the photo to you herewith. You might write to the United States Air Force, Technical Information Division, for any information they may have on this sighting. Unusual cloud formations are sometimes mistaken for flying objects.

Faithfully yours,

For the Editors
