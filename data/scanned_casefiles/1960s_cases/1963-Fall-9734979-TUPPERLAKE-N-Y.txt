April 6, 69

U.S. Air Force

A few weeks back I sent a snapshot of a formation that looked like a jet plane and a negative. I wonder if you would be kind enough to return them to me.

Enclosed find stamp!

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a low-quality, grainy black and white photograph showing what seems to be a landscape or terrain with some indistinct lines or objects, but the details are very unclear due to the poor image quality.

Dear [redacted]:

Enclosed is the photograph with negative which you were kind enough to forward to the Air Force for analysis.

A thorough investigation by our photographic experts fails to disclose a positive explanation for this unusual phenomena. The 11-inch streak located in the middle of the frame resulted from a crease in the negative. The hazy form located on the left side could possibly be an unusual cloud formation caused by weather phenomenon or perhaps distorted wind blown vapor contrails. These are only possibilities and should be regarded as such.

We are returning your photograph and negative as you requested.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

1. Reference the attached correspondence from
requesting information on an unusual photo. The following is
provided to assist your office in answering his letter:

a. The light streak located in approximately the middle of
the frame resulted from a crease in the negative.

b. The hazy form located on the left side of the frame is
unidentified. However, there is a possibility that the object
was an unusual cloud formation caused by weather phenomena, or
perhaps distorted wind blown vapor controls. These are only
possibilities and should be regarded as such.

2. We are returning black and white photo and negative along
with one black and white copy made here.

March 16 64

Gentlemen:

Enclosed you will find
photo and negative of formation
I am upset that for the while I had
the UFO described the company
must have thought the report was
new a joke and that not from some
going over my negatives this year
I call this negative and remember
snapping this weird formation of
an celestial day and this
formation was the only thing in
the sky. Having been in the Air
Force I had no such thing as a
flying coffin but we got the
whole thing I had of I thought right


- page 8 -

Here is the text from the document:

Briefly this photo and tell
me what if you people think you
I know if you have seen so well
lot of wonderful things but tell
me I think you have developed
such a thing as a ghost from
nowhere if you could do me
a favor will allow this picture
of a little large

Hope this will not bore if you

Respectfully,
[Redacted name]

Dear [redacted]

Thanks for sending LIFE your picture of an unusual cloud formation, which you and a friend witnessed. We're sorry we are unable to help clear up the mystery. The shape of the cloud shown resembles a sweep-wing jet fighter, but we couldn't say exactly what it is.

We're returning the photo to you herewith. You might wish to query the United States Air Force Information Office at the Pentagon, Washington 25, D.C. They might be able to shed more light on this strange sight.
