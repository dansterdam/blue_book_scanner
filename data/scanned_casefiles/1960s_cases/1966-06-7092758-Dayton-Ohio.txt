Astro (Moon)

Moon was setting at 295° AZ at 2130 Local

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted object comparable in brightness to the moon. Bottom edge was convex, top sides irregular but size and shape changed during observation. There were red orange flashes noted. Object just faded from view. Observer reported clouds in the area of the sighting possibly accounting for the disappearance of the moon. On 20 June the moon was approaching the first quarter which would have been as the observer reported.
