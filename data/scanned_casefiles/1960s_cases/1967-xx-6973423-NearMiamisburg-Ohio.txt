PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE: 09/17/02

2. LOCATION: Near Miamisburg, Ohio (5 Witnesses)

10. CONCLUSION: Possible (AIRCRAFT)
Since the object was roughly NE of the observers it was probably over Kettering. Both the Kettering police dept. and the police dept. in Miamisburg were contacted. No one reported anything unusual to them on this day. There is nothing to indicate that the object could not have been a helicopter.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers sighted an object that periodically reflected sunlight. The object was going back and forth from a position to roughly ENE of the observers. When the object reflected sunlight it looked as if it were long and thin. Its size was approx that of a medium size star on a clear night.

3. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

4. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 Minutes

5. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

6. COURSE: Stationary

7. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [X] No

12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT REFLECTED LIGHT OR WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER IT WAS SOLID, TRANSPARENT, WHETHER EDGES WERE SHARP OR FUZZY. DESCRIBE THE SHAPE OR INDICATE IF IT APPEARED AS A POINT OF LIGHT. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

The object appeared to be very small and very high. It could be described as a medium size star on a clear night when it reflected the sun. Because it continually reflected brightly for a few seconds and then went to a dull or no reflection at all, it gave the impression it was spinning very slowly (about one revolution every 15-30 seconds). It appeared to be solid since it reflected light as might a high altitude small jet plane.

The object was the size of a medium size star, very small and very high, reflected the sun at times, appeared to be solid and a shiny metal. When the sun reflect off it surface it looked as if it were long and thin (cigar shaped). Comparable to a dirigible which is very high and very far away. The object remained stationary for several minutes at times. Because it was stationary and yet alternately went from bright to dull, it gave the impression it was rotating very slowly. At no time was the object seen to make a sudden or quick movement.

Because we moved from the window down twice for a short period of time, the object would flash bright for a few seconds and then go dull and then back to bright. This continued the entire duration of the time the object was in sight.

The object seemed small and to be sitting slowly, almost like the object would reflect slightly for a few seconds and then might dwell and at times not reflect at all. It moved slowly from position A to B, then remain stationary at point B, then move back to point A. At one point the red smoke from a foundry filtered the bright light and the object looks size shaped

Dear Sir:

In reference to your letter of May 7, 1968, to this department:

We have made a check of our records and the cigar shaped object you described was not reported to this department. No report of an unidentified flying object of any shape was made on or about that date.

The only information we have that would be of any importance to you would be the weather. The weather on that day and night was clear and temperature was in the low 40's.

Respectfully,
