PROJECT 10073 RECORD
2. LOCATION Near Miamishurg, Ohio (3 witnesses)
12. CONCLUSION Possible (AIRCRAFT) since the object observed apparently NE of the observers it was probably over battering. Both the observers stated that the object disappeared to the northeast. So one possible explanation for this case could be that it was an aircraft.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS There is nothing to indicate that this object could not have been an aircraft. It could not have been anything else based on the information given.
Observers sighted an object that periodically maneuvered back and forth from a position apparently to the northeast of the observers. The object was going back and forth for several minutes. Its size was approx that of a medium-sized aircraft on a clear night.

5. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREET LIGHTS.
The object appeared to be very small and very high. It could be described as a medium size star on a clear night when it reflected the sun. Because it continually reflected brightly for a few seconds and then went to a dull or no reflection at all, it gave the impression it was spinning very slowly ( about one revolution every 15-30 seconds). It appeared to be solid since it reflected light as might a high altitude small jet plane.

19. WHAT WAS THE SIZE ESTIMATE OF THE OBJECT?
The object, very small and very high, reflected the sun at times, appeared to be solid, and very shiny metal. When the sun reflected off it surface it looked as if it were long and thin (cigar shaped). Comparable to a dirigible which is very high and very far away. The object remained stationary for several minutes at times. Because it was stationary and yet alternately went from bright to dull, it gave the impression it was rotating very slowly. At no time was the object seen to make a sudden or quick movement.

20. IN ORDER THAT WE MAY OBTAIN AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, DESCRIBE IN YOUR OWN WORDS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE SIZE, SHAPE, AND DISTANCE FROM YOU; AND THE DURATION OF OBSERVATION:

The object was a round, light colored thing in the sky. It appeared to be stationary, remaining in the same position for several minutes. The sight was unusual and did not resemble any normal aircraft or known light source at all. It moved slowly and noiselessly, and then seemed to descend behind some distant treetops. At this point, it disappeared from sight. The object made no sound and appeared to be getting brighter rather than dimmer, not like a flare or searchlight which would normally get dimmer. The object presented an unusual appearance, being neither as bright as a star nor as dim as a satellite. Its steady, unwavering position was also unusual for any known aircraft.

Grasping from the shape of the object, it seemed that it was the size of a baseball, oval in shape, and moving very fast in a horizontal direction. Its movement seemed to be erratic, with sudden accelerations and changes in direction. This seemed to indicate the possibility that it was intelligently controlled. The object was visible for less than a minute before disappearing from sight. It seemed to be about half a mile away, and the speed was estimated at several hundred miles per hour.

The image contains two photographs. 

The first photograph is a compass rose diagram with directional labels. This diagram appears to be instructional, providing guidance on how to use the compass rose to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon.

The second photograph shows two sketches. The larger sketch depicts a landscape with a road or path leading towards a distant horizon. There is a small figure standing in the foreground. The smaller sketch shows a more distant, hilly landscape.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "O" ON THIS COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT WAS HEADING TO.

2. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IT WILL ALLOW US TO CALCULATE THE SPEED AND DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON.
