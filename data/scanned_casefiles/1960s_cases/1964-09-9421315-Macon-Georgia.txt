6. EVALUATION: SOURCE X INFORMATION 1
7. SOURCE: Macon Ga, Telephone numbers: [Redacted]
At approximately 0325 hours, 6 Sep 64, a source telephonically reported to Security and Law Enforcement Division, Robins AFB Ga, that while visiting the residence of Macon Ga, at about 0245 hours (Eastern Standard Time), 6 Sep 64, he observed an object that was reddish orange in color, glowing, egg shaped, with beam of light in front at about 55 degrees above the horizon. During the "visible dipping" and "morning star" phases, this described object was observed for only a few seconds and traveled about twelve inches from North to Southeast and disappeared. Seconds later, two objects that looked like stars were observed in the same location as the first object. These two objects moved up and down and side to side like the "latter sign". These objects were observed for about two hours and faded out in place at daybreak. AIC Lewis M. Swartzbaugh, AF1366511, Air Policeman, was dispatched to 1107 James St, Macon Ga, where the following information was obtained:
1a. Description of the single object first observed:
(1) Shape: Egg shaped
(2) Size compared to a known object: About the size of a ball point pen

Went to bank about 4:30 pm on the way to the garden to find out whether to contact FTD and my car stopped running 2/3 way there. Didn't think much about it being unusual, but 20 mins later the motor started again as I was driving to my gas station. Stopped again at the gas station, got gas and headed for home. Parked in my driveway and had normal evening. Next day I called FTD to report my car stoppage and they seemed interested that it happened near the time of the sightings. I had not reported my car stoppage before as I did not think it was related to the sightings. There was no damage to the car or any indication as to why it stopped. I have had my car checked and no mechanical problems found. My sightings were on: 6-19-64 at 8:15 pm - 2 bright lights - one went from East to West and one from West to East at a high rate of speed. 6-22-64 at 8:24 pm - 2 bright lights - one went from North to South and one from South to North at a high rate of speed. Both sightings were at low altitudes on a clear night. No sound from the objects. Rama
