COMMENTS: Witness later stated obj was 6-8°, 1961, but did not sketch. Worthless estimation was made. It is particularly impossible for anyone to estimate altitude of an obj in sky at night without knowing its true size. Probably Echo 1 late to direct, right path, duration, size, and color.

KEL A CHECK WITH CHADS WEATHER STATION DISCLOSED THE RELEASE OF
NUMEROUS BALLOONS AT 0500Z BY SPRINGFIELD, PEORIA, ST LOUIS, TERRE
HAUTE, DAYTON, AND OTHER WEATHER AGENCIES IN THE AREA OF LOUISVILLE.
A STRONG POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THE SIGHTING COULS HAVE BEEN A
WEATHER BALLOON RELEASED FROM A STATION WEST OF LOUISVILLE. THIS, IN
CONJUNCTION WITH A WESTERLY FLOW OF AIR ACROSS THE SECTOR COULD HAVE
POSITIONED A BALOON IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF LOUISVILLE AT THE TIME
OF THE SIGHTING. CHADS WEATHER STATION CONFIRMED A WESTERLY FLOW UP
WOND AT ANA ALTITUDE BELOW 80,000 FT. L. NONE. M. PILOT
OF DC-8 STATED THE OBJECT MIGHT BE AN OBJECT IN SPACE.
