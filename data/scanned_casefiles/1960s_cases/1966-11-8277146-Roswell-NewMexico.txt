UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT                                29 November 1966

Submitted to:   1st Lt. Robert D. Dubiel, Information Office, Walker
                AFB, Itfax, on 23 Nov 66 by "r.                Director
                Roswell New Mexico Museum.

NARRATIVE:  On Tuesday evening, 22 November 1966, Mr. [redacted] and
his assistant museum director were driving from Vaughn, New to Roswell,
Hilex on highway 285. Leaving Vaughn at about 1930 NST they noticed what
they thought was "an awfully bright" star after driving about 20 miles.
The "star" was about 35 degrees above the SE horizon and was a bright
white light. They drove on trying to figure out what state it was.

The light then moved west across the highway and dropped to 20 degrees
above the horizon, so they stopped the car to take a closer look. No
sound was made by it and it was described it then as a "pulsating
light that would dim out following by a blinking red light". After the
red light the white light would return and so on.

They watched the "UFO" all the way to Roswell arriving about 2100
hours NST. During the course of this trip, it moved in the following
pattern: after west across the highway it again moved east, then south
toward Roswell, then west, then east where they could no longer see it
because of trees, etc. It was east of Roswell when they arrived in Roswell.

The "UFO" moved at different speeds, but was not erratic. It made
sharp, quick turns when changing directions as opposed to gradual turns.
It was stationary at some points and seemed throughout the evening to
change altitudes. Being so far away Mr. Smith and his assistant guessed
that it was always south of Roswell.
