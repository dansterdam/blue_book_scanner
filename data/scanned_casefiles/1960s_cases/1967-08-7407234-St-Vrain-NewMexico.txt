10. CONCLUSION
1. Other: (MISSILE RE-ENTRY)
2. Possible (HOT AIR BALLOON)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer first sighted something that looked like meteors but didn't burn out. The observer then sighted a pale yellow light that was about 3/4 the size of the moon. The object was loosing altitude when first seen but then it gained altitude and disappeared to the SW.

COMMENTS: The objects that looked like meteors were identified as part of an Athena that impacted at White Sands. A temperature inversion existed at 18,000 ft. The second object could have been either an antcraft with landing lights on. (There are several airfields in the area) or possible a Hot Air Balloon.

The wind was blowing toward the south at 3 knots.

THIS OBJECT 10 MILES WEST OF CANNON AFB CLOVIS NM. OBJECT OVER FIRING RANGE. OBJECT'S (3) FIRST SEEN PASSED FROM SIGHT BEHIND FAR HILL > STILL STREAMING SPARKS AND FIRE. DID NOT BURN UP AS METEORS USUALLY DO WHEN THEY ARE THIS SMALL. THESE FIREBALLS HAD TO PASS AHEAD THE LARGE OBJECT "GLOBE" RESEMBLED A COMET, WITH ITS TAIL GLOWING BEHIND. THEN PARALLEL AS IT MADE A TURN. IT WENT HORIZONTALLY FOR ABOUT A MINUTE THEN MADE ANOTHER TURN J AND AS WE WATCHED, IT GOT SMALLER, DIMMER, FADED TO A FAINT GLOW AND FINALLY FADED.

I AM SURE ABOUT THE TIME AS WE USE TACHOGRAPH CHARTS ON CLOCKS AND WHEN I SEE THE GLOBE I LOOKED AT THE CLOCKS AND WROTE MY CO-DRIVER UP. WE WATCHED THE OBJECT UNTIL IT FADED.

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS, I HAVE MY OWN OPINION, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVED.

Called SSgt O'Donnell at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. Asked him to callboth
Holloman AF Range and White Sands and find out if any missile activity at
the time of the sightings. We were particularly interested in cloud releases.
Sgt. said he would call back as soon he found out info.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

21 Sept. 1967

Sgt O'Donnell called
No missile activity at all from Melrose.

White Sands had two re-entry vehicles
1st 070972 25 Aug.
2nd 0532 25 Aug.
(They had one rocket launch that morning but it was not an
orbital shot of any kind.)

Sgt. O'Donnell said the civilian at White Sands said that while
they were watching for the re-entry vehicles that were
disturbed by a bright white light (in a different section of the
sky than that expected for the missiles) that came quite near the
earth. Sgt. O'Donnell said that they had no idea what the light
was.

Called White Sands.
did not actually see the light
himself, but a Navy Commander
Commander McBurney did see it.

Memo for the Record
Subj: UFO Observation, 25 August 1967

Lt. Marano spoke with Navy Commander McBurney regarding the unidentified observation of 25 August 1967. A couple of us were watching what was flying around. I didn't call in the range surveillance because at about that time the Athena came in and it came in over the range and it completely slipped my mind about the UFO. It couldn't have been observed for over 45 seconds, it was more or less stationary.

I would estimate the object to be 25 or 40 miles from where I was sitting. I personally thought it was an airplane. The airspace was cleared for the Athena but, at times planes do get in. We had five aircraft in the area at about 40,000 ft altitude. The athena came from very high and fell from that distance then appeared to fall very slow, a very bright light. Since there are mountains in the background I doubt that surveillance radar could have picked it up, they don't do a very good job. The second stage of the Athena looked like a meteor, red in color. the second stage was ninety seconds behind the third stage. The third stage sparkled because it still had fuel burning.

f. Identification of Observer: Civilian
Lubbock, Texas, phone: [redacted]. A reliable observer. At time of sighting, was [redacted] had a friend in the vehicle with him who also observed the object. I did not interview him, his name is [redacted], Lubbock, Texas.

g. Weather Conditions:

ALTITUDE    WIND DIRECTION    VELOCITY    TEMPERATURE
Surface     South             3 Knots     63°F
6,000       South             25 Knots    62°F

Ceiling and visibility: Clear 15 miles. No cloud cover or thunder storm in area. Temperature gradient was 116 degrees (normal)

h. Any unusual activity or conditions: At approximately 18,000 feet there was a temperature inversion of approximately 2 degrees.

i. Interception or Identification Action: None

j. Local air traffic conditions: None in the area at time of sighting.

k. Report prepared by: James O'Donnell, SSgt, Intelligence Specialist, 27th TRG, Cannon AFB, New Mexico. Duty extension 2639 or 2613. Home phone: [redacted].

Due to the information available to the Investigator, it is not possible to determine the cause of this sighting. Investigator does believe that the reflection of lights of the temperature inversion which existed at 18,000 feet in the area of the sighting may be responsible, at least in part for the report.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
