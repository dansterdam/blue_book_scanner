PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 25 August 67 25/07/16
2. LOCATION: St. Vrain, New Mexico
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. MANNER OF OBSERVATION: Sighting
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 14 minutes
6. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
1. Other: MISSILE RE-ENTRY (POSSIBLE ICBM AIR LAUNCH)
10. CONCLUSION: (1 Witness)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer first sighted something that looked like meteors but didn't burn out. The observer then sighted a high yellow object which was coming straight down and was losing altitude when first seen but then it gained altitude and disappeared to the south.
CC-CENTS: The objects that looked like meteors were identified as part of an air launch that impacted at White Sands. A temperature inversion in the area may have caused the high yellow object to appear to lose and then gain altitude.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
23 Sept. 1967

Called Sgt. O'Donnell at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. Asked him to call both Melrose AFB Range and White Sands and find out if any missile was fired between 1815 - 1855 hrs on 23 Sept. 1967 as he was notified of a bright light seen in the area. He said he would check and advise if any tests or firings could be disclosed.

Mr. J. O'Donnell called.
He made a visit to all from Melrose.
White Sands had two re-entry vehicles

(They had an official record of this but it was not an official crash)
Mr. O'Donnell said the civilians at White Sands said that while
they were watching for the re-entry (which was scheduled) they noticed a pulsating light that appeared to be approaching different sections of the sky. Mr. O'Donnell said that that exepted for the mission) that scene quite near the was observed by O'Donnell, that they had no idea what the light

Memo for the Record
Sub.: UFO Observation, 25 August 1967
Lt. Jerome people with very commander Memory regarding the unidentified observation of 25 August 1967. A couple of us were watching what was flying around. I didn't call in the range surveillance because at about that time the helmet came in and it came in over the range and it completely slipped my mind about the UFO. It couldn't have been observed for over 45 seconds, it was more or less stationery. I would estimate the object to be 25 or 30 miles from where I was sitting. I personally thought it was an airplane. The airspace was cleared for the Athens but, at times, planes do get in. We had five aircraft in the area at about 40,000 ft altitude. The Athens came in very high and fell from that distance then appeared to fall very slow, a very bright light. Since there are mountains in the background I don't think surveillance radar could have picked it up, they don't do a very good job. The second stage of the Athens looked like a meteor, red in color. the second stage was nearly seconds behind the third stage. The third stage sparked because it still had fuel burning.

The image contains a compass rose diagram and some handwritten text, but no photograph. Based on the instructions, I will not attempt to identify any humans in the image.

The text in the image reads:

27. In the direction that the object or objects moved, place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

WE SAW TWO OBJECTS STARTING FROM ALMOST THE SAME POINT MOVING A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND THEN THEY STARTED MOVING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND FROM TOP TO BOTTOM MOVING AT VERY RAPID SPEED THAT THEY BECAME INVISIBLE JUST AS QUICK AS THEY APPEARED FROM THE SAME POINT AS IF THEY WERE SOME KIND OF MECHANICAL DEVICE THAT FLEW IN FORMATION ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE ON A CABLE OR ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER IN SOME WAY.
