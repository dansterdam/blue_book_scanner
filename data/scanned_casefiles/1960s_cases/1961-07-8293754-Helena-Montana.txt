10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two round bright objs in trail three minutes apart observed by B-52 crew with eye & extent 3-4 times as bright as satellites. Size of stars. Steady flight, straight & level. Initial observation 4 degs below moon rapidly at estimated 25 deg elevation. Into sun at 10 deg elev 260dgr azimuth. Observation through sextant did not reveal additional features. A/C was heading 098dgr. Speed 140 knots, WX clear visibility unlimited.

11. COMMENTS
Observation prior to dusk. A/C on J-80 inbound to Billings. Rptd obj moving West. Initial sighting along 7-7 at about Whitehall. Two jet a/c on this route enroute to Malstrom at Great Falls, Montana would present this configuration. Objs would appear to be moving West in reality they were at greater alt/than 38,000ft moving North at about same or greater speed than observers A/C. Case evaluated as A/C.

1961 UNCLASSIFIED

21 JULY, 1961  Helena, Montana.  The 22/X0326

Report received from Glasgow AFB, Montana on 25 July using AFR 200-2 Format.

Two round bright objects in trail three minutes apart, observed by F-102 crew while naked eye and centaur. Objects were 3-4 times as bright as a white light in color, round, and small magnitude. Observed was possibly white, initially stationary, then moving rapidly. Increased and then decreased in size below the moon, objects moving rapidly. Estimated azimuth 52 degrees, above horizon at 15 degrees above the horizon, 250 degrees azimuth. Observation through eastern 053 degrees at a speed of 4-6 knots.

Weather was clear, visibility unlimited.

Movement from East to West rules out celestial possibilities. All characteristics are on file at Glasgow AFB. Further analysis, flight pattern, and speed are consistent with this analysis. Reasonable features of the case when looking at other distances were often when objects were heading toward the sun. Although sighting was near dusk and the objects were heading into the sun, the witnesses should have been able to identify some features of the objects. Lower of the observers qualifications this case is considered unidentified.
