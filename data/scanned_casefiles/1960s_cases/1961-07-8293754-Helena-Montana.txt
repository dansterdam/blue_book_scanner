PROJECT BLUE BOOK CASE RECORD
CAS  FILE NO: 1961-00293
DATE/TI:.E GROUP: 25/2030Z
LOCATION:  Helena, Montana
REPORT RECEIVED FROM: Glasgow AFB, Montana ON 25 July was FLTR 220/02024
SUBJECT: AIRCRAFT SIGHTING
OBJECT DESCRIPTION:  Aircraft was described as large and silvery in color, appearing to have a triangular shape. It was apparently moving at a high rate of speed and making no sound. Object was observed for approx 2-3 minutes.
DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:  Two witnesses, TSGT John R. White and A2C Melvin E. Hage, were on duty at the Glasgow AFB Control Tower at the time of the sighting. TSGT White described the object as large and silvery in color and appearing to have a triangular shape. He stated that it was moving at a high rate of speed and was making no sound. The object was in sight for approximately 2-3 minutes. A2C Hage corroborated TSGT White's account of the sighting.
INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:  Aircraft was heading approx 330 degrees and at an estimated altitude of 25,000-30,000 feet. Due to the high altitude, speed, and lack of noise, it is considered unlikely that this object could have been a conventional aircraft.  The sighting is therefore classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
