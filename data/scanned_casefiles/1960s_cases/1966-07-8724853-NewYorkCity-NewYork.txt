No Close, Info Only
Put in 29 July Manhattan Case

29 July 66
Manhattan N.Y.

UFO Was Just
Copter Flares
NEW YORK (UP) — Thousands of Manhattan residents saw an "Unidentified Flying Object" hovering over the State of Liberty early today. Police headquarters received numerous reports of light that occasionally dropped "pieces of fire" into the Hudson River.

The Coast Guard later detailed the alarm. This was a rescue helicopter dropping flares in search of a man reported overboard from a sinking boat.
