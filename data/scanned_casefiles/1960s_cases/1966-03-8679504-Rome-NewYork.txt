Gentlemen:

Reference is made to your letter of 4 April 1966. There is a slight misunderstanding on your part as to who saw the unidentified object or objects on the evening of 27 March 1966.

My neighbor's son, who is a deaf-mute [redacted], also saw the object and reported it to the APS for him. I personally did not see the object as I was inside the house watching TV at the time.

I gave my blank FTD Form 164 [redacted] for him to use for his file copy of the sighting report.

Best regards,
[redacted]
