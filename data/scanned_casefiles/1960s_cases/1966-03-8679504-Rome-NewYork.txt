Reference is made to your letter of 4 April 1966. There is a slight misunderstanding on your part as to who saw the unidentified object or objects on the evening of 27 March 1966.

My neighbor's [redacted], who is a deaf-mute requested that I report it to Griffiss AFB for him. I personally did not see the object as I was inside the house watching TV at the time.

I gave my blank FTD Form 164 [redacted] for his file copy of the sighting report.

Best regards,

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes. The objects were directly overhead when I first saw them and went out of sight the horizon to the north.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: ______

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: ______

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: I cannot hear no & do not know if a sound was
b. Color: light red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

This is hard to determine now. It has been over a week since I saw them.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch shows several circles and an arrow pointing downward]
