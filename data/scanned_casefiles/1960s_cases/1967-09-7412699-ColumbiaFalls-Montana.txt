1. Reference your letter, 7 May 1968, subject as above.

2. I have no knowledge of the indicated report. Although I was UFO Project Officer at that time, your letter of 19 September 1967 was not referred to me for action. No investigation was made. I departed the station (PCS) on 27 November 1967.

3. The only assistance I am able to offer is that the object was seen in the vicinity of Flathead County Airport.
