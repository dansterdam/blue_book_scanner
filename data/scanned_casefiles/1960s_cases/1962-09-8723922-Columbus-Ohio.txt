ATIC FORM 164 (REV 24 SEP 52)


- page 1 -

Much of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. There are some faint handwritten lines visible, but the text cannot be clearly read. The page appears to be a document with some sections redacted or blacked out, with a "B5" notation in the top right corner.


- page 2 -

The image appears to be a nearly blank document page with very faint, mostly illegible text. The text is so faint and blurry that I cannot confidently transcribe any specific words or characters. The page looks like an old, scanned black and white document with some light markings or smudges, but no clear readable text is visible.

Here is the text I can read from the image:

Postmark:

(There is a postage stamp with "U.S. POSTAGE" visible)
