PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE-TIME GROUP: August 64  0430Z

2. LOCATION: Fort Bragg, North Carolina   1 witness

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4-5 seconds each

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: Varied

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient data for evaluation
Possible reflection or actual observation of a bright spotlight shining upward and moving across the sky in a "raw" recording.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Witness reported observing white object appear almost directly overhead, then slowly move across the sky until it disappeared behind a bank of trees, then re-appeared going straight across. By account at a 180 degree angle to the first flight, disappearing and re-appearing, repeating several times. In the recording, the object never deviated from its path. The object, moving at a very fast speed, appeared to be followed by a tail of light. Witness believes this effect to be the result of its great speed and the image retention of my eyes.

The late date of the report does not warrant an intensive investigation. The case is being carried as insufficient data because without more information an evaluation is not possible.

FORM: FID SEP 64-0329 (TDE)

Dear Sirs:

Just recently I became interested in Unidentified Flying Ob-
jects, and while doing research in the field I decided I should
report the one(or many) that I saw.

DATE OF SIGHTING: Early August 1964, approximately 2330 hours
just off Sicily drive at Fort Bragg, N. C. (first sighting)

DURATION: 4 to 5 seconds each sighting

TYPE OF OBSERVER: High school student 14 years old. At one time
interested in astronomy.

NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Believed to be one.

STATUS: Indeterminable

DIMENSIONS: Undetermined. Appeared to be size of pin-head at arm's
length.

COLOR: White brighter than stars

SOUND: None noticed

ALTITUDE: Several miles (probably)

SPEED: Very fast

NARRATIVE: The UFO first appeared almost directly over-head as I hap-
pened to be looking up, moving straight across the sky until
it disappeared, behind a bank of trees, then re-appeared going
straight across again except at a 180 degree angle to the first
flight. Disappearing and reappearing several times before
completely "disappearing". It moved several times from one
point.

COMMENTS: The "object", moving at a very fast speed, appeared to
be followed by a tail of light, but I believe this effect to be
the result of its great speed and the in-no motion of my
eyes. The weather was clear where I was, but at the altitude
the object was I couldn't be sure of the weather. I don't think
it was a balloon because of the speed, and not a meteor because

of the motion; I don't think it was an airplane because it would
have been to high.

I hereby certify that all evidence given in this report is the
truth, and would be willing to submit to any truth test that is appropriate.
