SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object
Richfield, Ohio, 5 May 1960
Sighted by

TO: ATIC (AFCIN-462)

1. The following information received from the Cleveland, Ohio Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on 11 May 1960 furnished for your information and any action deemed appropriate.

On 5 May 1960 Mrs. [redacted], telephonically advised Special Agent John L. Stanley of the Cleveland Office that on four or five occasions during the past month between the hours of one and four AM she had observed a moon shaped luminous object which seemed to change colors to green, yellow, and chartreuse, and move slowly across the sky, being in view for twenty minutes or a half hour. She stated she could not tell how large or how far away the object was.

Mrs. [redacted], who is writing a book and often stays up until early in the morning to do her writing, stated she last saw the object about two weeks ago and that on this occasion the object appeared to send down rays of light similar to the beam of a flashlight. She added that she woke two of her daughters, ages 17 and 19, and that they observed the object.

Mrs. [redacted] stated that she had not reported seeing the flying object to any authorities prior to calling the FBI inasmuch as they would think she was "a screwball."

2. Investigation is not being conducted by the FBI in this matter.
