REPLY TO
ATTN OF: 	 13 May 1960

SUBJECT:	 (U) Unidentified Flying Object
RICHFIELD, OHIO, 5 MAY 1960

TO:	 ATTN: CAPT(S-4523)

1. The following information received from the Cleveland, Ohio Field Office of the investigation of Investigation on 11 May 1960 is furnished for your information and any action deemed appropriate.

On 5 May 1960, Special Agent, Richfield, Ohio, telephonically advised Special Agent, Cleveland, Ohio, that four residents of Richfield, Ohio, had observed a moon shaped luminous object approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The object was stationary approximately twenty minutes. The witnesses reported that the object appeared to show two or four Air Force jets pass directly through the center of the object. The object then vanished from sight after a duration of approximately a half hour. The witnesses stated they could not tell how large or how far away the object was.

Mrs. , who is writing a book and often stays up until early morning hours to do her writing, stated that this may be the fifth or sixth time she has observed similar objects in the sky and that they always appeared to send down rays of light similar to the beam of a searchlight. The witnesses would think she was "a screwball".

2. Investigation as not being conducted by the FBI in this matter.
