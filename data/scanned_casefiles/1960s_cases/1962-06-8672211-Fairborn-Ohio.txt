PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 3 Jun 1962

2. LOCATION: Fairborn, Ohio

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 2100, GMT 25/0300Z

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. PHOTOS: No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 min

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

9. COURSE: Generally S

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Star-like obj was observed by witness in Fairborn, Ohio. Obj was described as fuzzy or blurred and moved erratically. Witness stated he first thought obj to be satellite Echo. Witness observed obj moving generally to S.

11. COMMENTS: Positive conclusion can be reached in this case due to lack of substantial data and fact that exact position of obj at time of sighting cannot be determined for specific times. However, there was a light in area. Some of sighting and light of obj was probably caused by unusual perspective experience. Viewing celestial vault from ground position is probably a contributing factor. There is no evidence available which indicates obj was not a/c.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
- Was Balloon: No
- Probably Balloon: No
- Was Aircraft: No
- Probably Aircraft: Yes
- Was Astronomical: No
- Probably Astronomical: No
- Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation
