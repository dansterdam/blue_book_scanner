11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a luminous white obj at midnight, object in a fixed position for approximately 15 minutes prior to it splitting up into five objects. Then additional objects all streaked away toward the west. Everything was completely gone on about fire minutes after the initial object. Two up into five different objects. The sky was clear and no sound were viewed.

Dr. Hynek personally interviewed the observer. He feels that something, unique, was observed, but the case is made unidentified.

Attn: Major Hector Quintanilla

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In answer to your letter of 19 October 1966 requesting me to look into the sighting of Mr. made on 23 August 1966, I have the following to report.

I visited Mr. at his home in Columbus where he lives with Mrs. at. I did not make inquiries as to their relationship!

Both Mr. and Mrs. seemed like normal, sensible people whose word could be trusted. Mr. was a sixth grade teacher in the Columbus public schools and while neither of them have any scientific training to speak of, their story was told in a straightforward, non-sensational manner.

Both of them observed this phenomenon: it was called to Mr. attention by Mrs. when they were both out in the backyard at the time of late twilight. The stars were not yet out. I went out in the yard with them and had them go through the full description. Their retelling of the story tallied very well with the original statements made in Form 164 and so there is no point in retelling them here. I checked a few details such as the color of the main object which was white, and that of the ancillary or objects as a silver metallc color. The original object occupied about one-tenth of the total field of the binoculars and when it suddenly broke up and five objects fanned out from it to the west, he followed them with the binoculars for a few seconds until they just seemed to vanish. When he turned the binoculars back to the original spot he could no longer find the original object.

This case must remain unidentified unless we take the trouble to ask the Columbus newspapers to publish a short note asking other people in Columbus whether they had seen this sighting on 23 August 1966. I am sure these newspapers would cooperate and I personally think it worth a try. A letter

from your office, I believe, would be more effective than one from North-
western University which is not in Ohio. I would suggest that Lt. Marley
address the letter to the editors of the Columbus Citizen and Columbus
Dispatch, asking whether they would run a short story about this sighting.
This would enable us to make a triangulation and obtain an approximate
height of the object.

The original object seemed to be like a big star but appeared to have a
definite disk to it. Mr. _______ indicated that he even thought that the
center was a little darker than the outside. The binoculars were in good
focus since he used to using them and said he kept checking the focus as
he observed them. The central object was under observation for better than
10 minutes before it broke up.

It is an odd sighting in that it doesn't fit any general pattern, but I am
afraid it must remain unidentified. I don't see how we can quite fit a
balloon into the reported maneuver. He stated definitely that it did not
appear to be an explosion or a disintegration but rather an expulsion of
five objects that moved uniformly out from the central object and at a
considerable apparent speed.

I believe this covers the sighting unless you are able to get further
reports from other sources.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

NOTE- B IS SAME AS A SINCE AFTER PICKUP OF "SINGLE" OBJECT A THE "INDIVIDUAL" OBJECTS DISAPPEARED WHILE IN PLAIN SIGHT 15° AFTER SHOW 3 OR 4 SECONDS OF WESTWARD FLIGHT IN WHICH THEY FANNED-OUT ABOUT 15° (RIGHT ILLUS)

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and plug any changes in direction during the course.

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I A BEGAN OBS. FIRST LAS AT 11:13 (3) SAME A WHEN I HAD OBSERVED THIS FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES, WITH BOTH NAKED EYE AND 7X35 BINOCULARS AND I HAD ASCERTAINED THAT IT WAS NOT MOVING RELATIVE TO MY OCCASION CITRUS COMPANION SAW IT "BREAK" WITH FIXED OBJECTS AROUND ME, I SUDDENLY SAW IT "BREAK" INTO 5 RAPIDLY MOVING OBJECTS, I OBSERVED THESE MOVING TOWARD THE WEST (FANNING-OUT SLIGHTLY) AND THEN AFTER PERHAPS 3 OR 4 SECONDS THEY DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE OBJECT. THE SKY WAS CLEAR, NO STARS IN SIGHT (A LITTLE TOO HAZY FOR STARS). I HAVE DRAWN PICTURES TO ILLUSTRATE BREAK-UP (SEE #'S 19 & 28)

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This was a very unusual phenomenon. We know it was not a meteor "breaking up" because the object was stationary for at least 15 minutes in an almost overhead position before the gradation of the individual smaller objects from it.

The objects (5 or 6 in number) were elliptical shape. Even with 7 power binoculars they appeared about this size. They and very trace of the original object completely vanished while watched.

Whether there had been movement of the original object before it first appeared at it cannot verify (although there must have been some as it moved to that position). But there was no movement for the 15 minutes I watched it. In a reclining lounge chair, the object almost overhead. I could make note its lack of motion lying, perceiving comparisons of its position with known objects.

Here is the text from the document:

about me on the ground (and their silhouettes) 
improving on the photo). The movement occurred, 
with their appearance of the separate objects.

I hope this will prove of some value 
in your research of these phenomena. I intend 
to be as explicit and accurate as possible.

I (the briefing) occurred as fact that 
I can't recall within the were 3 or 6 objects after 
the briefing. Also almost positive that there were 5.

seems to heighten the facts of the sighting.
