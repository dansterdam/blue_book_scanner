Attn: Major Hector Quintanilla
Dear Major Quintanilla:

In answer to your letter of 12 October 1966 requesting me to look into the sighting of Mr. A. in Columbus on 23 August 1966, I have the following to report:

I visited Mr. A. at his home in Columbus where he lives with Mrs. A. I did not make inquiries as to their relationship.

Both Mr. and Mrs. A. seemed like normal, sensible people whose story could be true. They claimed that while together on the evening of 23 August 1966, they saw a circular object with a silvery metallic color which was illuminated and seemed to hover briefly over their home. When they went out in the backyard to get a better look it seemed to maneuver about silently and then suddenly disappear straight up. Their telling of the story tallied very well with the original statements made in earlier reports.

Both Mr. and Mrs. A. were quite emphatic in their insistence that what they had seen was not an aircraft or any other known object. The description of the ancillary object was a silver metallic color. The original object when first observed seemed to have an inner luminous area and then to be surrounded by a peripheral halo of light. When the object departed it did so swiftly and they were left with the binoculars for a few seconds until they just seemed to vanish. When he studied the binoculars later he found them to be covered with a fine sticky residue.

This case must remain unidentified unless we take the trouble to ask the Columbus newspapers to publish a short note asking other people in Columbus whether they had seen the same sighting on 23 August 1966. I am sure these witnesses would cooperate and it personally think it worth a try. A letter to the local press by me would not, I think, carry enough weight.

Major Quintanilla Page 2 3 November 1966

From your office, I believe, would be more effective than one from Northwestern University in view of the recipient's local address. I would suggest that the letter be addressed to the editors of the Columbus Citizen and Columbus Dispatch, asking them to make the information about this lighting appear in their newspapers. This would result in a larger circulation and wider local coverage of the incident.

The original object seemed to be like a big star but appeared to have a definite disk to it. Mrs. Quintanilla's description indicates that he even thought that the center was a little darker than the luminous wings. The central object was under observation for better than 15 minutes before it disappeared.

It is an odd sighting in that it doesn't fit any general pattern, but I am satisfied that Mrs. Quintanilla's testimony is valid. I don't believe that it appeared to be an explosion or a disintegration but rather an expulsion of five objects that moved individually out from the central object and at a low altitude.

I believe this covers the sighting unless you are able to get further reports from other sources.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This was a very unusual phenomenon - We knew its was not a meteor or a missile or any known type of aircraft. The object was shationary for a few minutes as it hovered over us before it suddenly disappeared. The individual paralleled objects from the original object appear to have been in a single line formation - They and gazed at the object , these were mostly within one mile and gave very similar descriptions. We still have the original object completely vanished."
