5. During the evenings of 21 December 1966, a newscaster from radio station KOGO, San Diego, reported he resides in Lemon Groves, California, and shortly before going on the air at to six his news broadcast, had observed UFO's in the vicinity of his residence. He described them as brilliant orange in color, flickering and dropping flaming material.

The newscaster reported he managed to follow one of these objects on foot and when it came to earth, he discovered it to be a plastic bag.

Of the type utilized by dry cleaning establishments to cover clothing. The bag, partially burned and a candle device along beneath the plastic bag, which when lit, gave the plastic bag buoyancy into the air.

COMMENTS: The UFO's which were reportedly sighted in the San Diego area during the month of December 1966, are deemed to be a hoax, perpetrated by unknown person(s). For record purposes this memorandum will be furnished to the nearest air force facility, March Air Force Base.

Ref: (a) COMFLEWEVEN INST 3820.1A of 1 Apr 1958

1. Reference (a), this letter is being sent containing all pertinent information concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects on the night of 16 Dec 1966. The basic format for the following information was taken from COMFLEWEVEN INST 3820.1A of 1 Apr 1958.

2. The objects sighted were basically round in shape about the size of a pea held at arms length. They appeared bright orange in color. The four objects sighted were at too great a distance to distinguish any details; they all appeared as bright orange balls of light. No sound was heard and there were no unusual physical features visible during the entire period of observation.

3. The objects were first noticed because of their brightness and unusual flight path across the sky. The first of the four objects were first sighted at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, using our position, 200 yards north of the main gate to USNARS Ream Field, as the reference point. The fourth object was first sighted on the horizon. The first three objects maintained a formation, changing their relative positions to each other as they moved from the East in a westerly direction. The fourth object remained apart from the other three, travelling initially in a northwesterly direction. Finally turning due west. All of the objects periodically stopped and held their positions for a maximum time of thirty seconds each. After approximately nine minutes the objects started to disappear. First, two objects out of the flight of three flickered and disappeared. Second, the lone object flickered and disappeared, and finally the third of the flight disappeared in the same manner as the other three.

4. These observations were made at 0530 Zulu visually from the ground. The actual weather at that time was clear, eight miles visibility, no cloud cover, with the winds at 240 degrees and twenty-five knots at fifty thousand feet. There was no reported thunderstorm activity in the area, with no unusual meteorological conditions seen or reported.

5. The observers present were as follows:
John H. Schmitt, Ensign, HS-10, Fleet replacement pilot
David C. Conklin, Ensign, VS-41, fleet replacement pilot
John M. Coghill, Ensign, VS-124, Fleet replacement pilot
Mrs. [name redacted]
