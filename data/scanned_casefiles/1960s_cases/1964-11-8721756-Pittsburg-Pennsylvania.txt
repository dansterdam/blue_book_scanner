Dear Sir, I am a Yellow Taxicab Driver, in Pittsburgh, Penna.

While working the shift from Six in the evening, until four mornings I spend some time each day at Greater Pittsburgh Airport. We look for approaching planes, as a forwarding that passengers are arriving to be driven into the down-to section of Pittsburgh, and have noticed many of what seems to be falling stars, lately.

Last evening I saw three that seemingly fell onto the Airport, and seemed to lose their tiny tails and light about 500 ft above ground.

A very close one fell several months ago, atop a Hill here, called Mt. Washington, overlooking the Monongahela River and the downtown area. I was standing outside of my Taxicab, looking up into the sky, as I saw a fiery bright rocket like object fall, and seemed to burn to nothing. I then above my head, I was looking at an angle of 45 degrees to level, and it came into my vision, falling straight down, and burning up about a height of three hundred fast above the ground.

A hissing noise was evident, for a very short time, and a sound of crinkling metal foil, seemed to issue from a floating piece of dark or burned ash that seemed to float down to earth. I could estimate it was hitting the earth about a thousand yards from me, towards the East.

I was parked on the Taxicab stand (it Washington, 10,1) at the Lamont restaurant, on Grandview Avenue, Washington, Pittsburgh, Pa.

I have sighted at least twenty of these falling star like objects, I last two years, The one on Mont Washington about February 1964, these last three were Nov 6, 1964 at the Airport.

No doubt these are farther away than I thought them to be, But there is no warning, and sighting is so short, It is hard to tell much.

Hoping you have some idea, This may add something to,

Sincerely,
