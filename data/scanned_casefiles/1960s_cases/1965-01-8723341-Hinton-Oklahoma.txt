35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

We were out of the car and looking up. We saw something at first, then we thought we saw a falling star. Then we saw it wasn't falling and there we were trying one. We were so excited to take time to come back quickly to see them. By the time we had gotten there, the object had disappeared into the night and were not going to see it again. But on the girly night we noticed a ball or a light moving in the west up the same description.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

They were, as I remember, simply spread out the distance. I have no idea what at their size. That is they were 50 ft in length. Then they were 50 ft apart at the wing. At first they were 25 ft in length. Then they were 50 ft apart. I don't have any idea how large they were.

Major Hector Quintanilla

Box 9494
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

The following is a report on the [redacted] case of
Hinton, Oklahoma:

I called on Sunday afternoon, April 25 and was able to get him immediately.
We talked for approximately twenty minutes.

The answer is probably birds, but he is going to read to the Lubbock experiment
of flying a kite at night, seeing whether it picks up any light. There
are some Mercury lights in town (Hinton, population 1000) which is about a
half mile to the east. Birds do migrate and fly around at that season.
The idea of birds did not surprise him. He said that he just never thought
of that. He felt that they would have to be quite close to be birds, and
it turns out that they would have to be about three or four hundred feet
away. The night was extremely bright and clear, and he said that he could see
a car from fifty feet off. Furthermore, there was a streetlight a hundred
and fifty feet to the right. The lights near his home are incandescent, but
the town has about a dozen mercury lights. The lights were first spotted
west of him so it would have been actually a mile west of town where the
lights were first spotted.

He is a Boy Scout and so somewhat familiar with astronomy, and I asked
whether the lights were brighter or dimmer than the stars of the Big
Dipper. He said that they were probably slightly brighter, but they were
a creamy white color, off white like the lights you get from an old painted
ceiling.

Although sixteen years old, he seemed to be quite a steady lad, unexcitable
and familiar with wildlife in those regions as he said that there was a lot
of hunting that goes on around there. He is clearly an outdoors type and
was familiar with the fact that birds might be flying around at that season.

He asked me a question about Hines' article in the Sunday Oklahoman which had
a picture of a UFO by somebody named [redacted]. What's the situation on that
picture? He will send up a copy of the Oklahoman along with the results of
his kite experiment.

Sincerely yours,

Another sighting was made the same night at the foot of a mountain near Marion, Va. This UFO had sparks flying from it, and was heard to explode with a "cracking" sound. A few seconds later, something rose up from the explosion and headed toward Marion. A small fire resulting from the explosion was put out by Forestry officials, but apparently no physical evidence was found.

On the night of January 25th, several people watched a twinkling object, shaped like a pie plate and looking like a spinning top, which bobbed up and down at very low altitude over the Rappahannock River, at Fredericksburg, Va. The object was observed for a period of ten minutes.

Boys See UFOs

Five 3rd grade boys of the Stoddert
School in Glover Park (near Washington,
D.C.) claim they saw UFO during their
lunch period at 12:45 p.m. on January
25 this year. One boy, Christopher Jordan, told his father about it after school
that evening. He had told his school
teacher but she called it nonsense.

Later in the evening Mr. Jordan had
an opportunity to question his son's
friend, Darius Lawrence, who lives nearby. He interrogated the boy and found
his story jibed with Christopher's.

The next day Jordan was reminded of
the incident when he heard a radio broadcast about UFOs being seen in the area.
He then questioned his son's other occupants, friends who verified the
sightings and whose description tallied
with Christopher's.

Drawings made by the boys were not
so similar, however—but the inability to
project on paper what is seen with the
eyes is merely a lack of talent.

The object: "Like an airplane without
wings." No sound. While observed, it
was first silver, then it lit up and changed color from orange to red, then green.
It was still in the sky when the boys went
to class.

Dear Sir;

On January 30, 1965 at approximately 10:15 p.m. C.S.T. I saw what I believe to be a formation of Flying saucers.

My friend, and I had been driving around town when he decided he needed to use the bathroom he got out of the car and while using the bathroom spotted what he thought to be a Falling star. Then he noticed that they were not Falling but moving From East to West. I was sitting in the car and he called to me.

I shot out of the car and saw a Formation of about 12 objects to me. I hot of a pencil emersure held at arms length, or maybe a little smaller. They looked to be about the height of that of an airliner. The were instead of the red and green of airplane lights glowing a dim or cream white. Im not over 10 seconds they moved From about 40° west, above the gorizen to about N 50° above the horizen East. Roughly 1/3 of the sky. They were moving in a straight line across the ground as we faced them to W East at an angle of approximately 10° over the slunds. We got back in the car and went across the street to tell my sister and her Friend to come look. We went to the door while I hunted the sky for them.

We heard the sound of a plane which we had not heard before, but didn't respot the objects.

Yours truly

P.S. The formation took like this to me. (drawing not clearly visible)

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
about 1/5 p

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
