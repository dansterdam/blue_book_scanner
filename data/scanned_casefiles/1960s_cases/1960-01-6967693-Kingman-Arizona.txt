5 January 1960

On the same evening, a blue light which raced silently across the Las Vegas, Nevada sky, puzzled McCarran Field tower personnel, "It was the fastest thing I ever saw", said tower employee Jack McMillon who spotted the light at about 11:15 p.m. A departing private plane also saw the object. Earlier that evening, four different pilots in two commercial airlines planes flying between Groom Canyon and Mormon Mesa reported observing a similar light.

Air reports of the object to Salt Lake City were intercepted by the McCarran Field tower. McMillon was saw the light for about two or perhaps three seconds, going north to south at about a 15-20 degree elevation. He also said he thought at night it have been a meteor but changed his mind as it left no trail, and had a horizontal trajectory. He said he contacted a private plane which had just taken off and asked the pilot for confirmation. The pilot confirmed McMillon's sighting. An Air Force F-89 inbound to Nellis also confirmed its pilot had also seen a similar light.
