OCR Text:

"On the same evening, a blue light was observed slightly across the Hualapai mountains about 2 miles southwest of Kingman. This light was observed by Thomas McCarten, Kingman rancher. Mr. McCarten stated that the light first appeared very bright and then seemed to fade, but came back as bright as before. The light was observed for about 2 1/2 hours by Mr. McCarten who stated the light appeared to be hovering or stationary and would at times appear and disappear. Other persons in Kingman also saw the object or light that evening and described it the same as McCarten. Prior to 1 a.m., September 16, 1960, the light was reported observing a similar light. The light was reported to be 'sharp and clearly defined, giving the impression of being a very bright and concentrated light source'. The light was observed by the McCarten for over an hour and by the authorities in Kingman including the local Sheriff's Office. They stated the light gave the appearance of a very bright steady light and would at times become dim and then become as bright as before. The pilot confirmed McCarten's account, and also stated he observed the object through binoculars and that it appeared to be a very bright light, stationary and hovering approximately 2 to 3 miles from his position. He also said he had spotted it visually without binoculars. The pilot stated the object appeared to have a horizontal trajectory. He said he estimated a private plane which had time to inspect the object closely, within a few hundred yards. The aircraft used by the authorities to investigate was a T-33 assigned to Nellis Air Force Base on training flights. The pilot confirmed McCarten's account and also stated he observed the object through binoculars and that it appeared to be a very bright light, stationary and hovering approximately 2 to 3 miles from his position. He also said he had spotted it visually without binoculars."
