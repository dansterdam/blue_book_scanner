1. DATE - TIME GROUP
   12 July 66   01:52U
   13/0352U

2. LOCATION
   Albuquerque, New Mexico                one witness

3. SOURCE
   Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
   one

10. CONCLUSION
    1. Aircraft
    2. ASTRO(METEOR)

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
   2-3 minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    Observer watched a star like object then later a long shaped object travel toward the SW. The first object left a trail and the second nothing. In both cases the object was very high and going SW. The object disappeared slowly in the SW.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
   Ground Visual

7. COURSE
   SW

8. PHOTOS
   □ Yes
   ■ No

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. It is actually difficult to determine how long the object was visible. From the description it appears that two objects were observed instead of one as reported. If this is the case there is no indication as to how long each was visible.

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
   □ Yes
   ■ No
