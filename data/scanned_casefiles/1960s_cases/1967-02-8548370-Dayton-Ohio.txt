MEMO for the Record: 8 March 67

Contact with WP AFB, Base Operations revealed that there was an aircraft flying around the north Dayton area on the day in question. The aircraft was not from WP as far as the base ops personnel know.

The aircraft was testing aircraft lighting and was a most unusual thing to observe. A local company that makes aircraft lighting tests similar configurations have been responsible for numerous UFO reports. The exact company was not known. Base personnel said that they felt that this aircraft was responsible for the sighting.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a bright orange-colored object in the
eastern sky. One observer compared the object to a Shell
Oil Sign in the sky. One observer thought it was the moon
but then later did not think so. The object appeared to
be moving toward the south. Clouds covered the object at
one point. The object was at first round but later like
a cigar. Another witness said that the object was
directly in the east and was like a big orange ball.

Ground/Visual

7. COURSE
Basically stationary

8. PHOTOS
Yes

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

Contact with Wt control tower and the Cox Airport control
tower did not reveal that anyone there had seen anything
out of the ordinary. This was done about 15 minutes after
the last sighting was phoned in to the duty officer.
