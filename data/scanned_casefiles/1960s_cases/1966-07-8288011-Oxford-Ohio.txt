Sirs:

After years of wondering, I finally saw what to me was an Unidentified Flying Object, and while I hesitated to report this, I thought it might be of some value or that there may have been others who reported the same thing.

On Wed. night July 6th between 9:30 and 10:00 PM I saw two blinking white-green lights blinking in the sky. They were almost directly overhead and were moving from the north-west to south-east at a rapid pace. I assumed that it was an airplane but then the lights just disappeared and there was no visible cloud cover.

Also this object covered this distance in a very short time. Had it been a plane it would appear to me that to be covering this distance in this time it would have had to have been low enough so that I would have heard the engine but it was completely silent. And I did not have high enough to could not hear the engines it would have covered this distance in so short a period.

Of course my experience is limited and this may very well have been a plane or some other logical explanation but to me it certainly remains as unidentified.

Sincerely,
