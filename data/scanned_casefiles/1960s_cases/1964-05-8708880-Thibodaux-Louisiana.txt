COMMENTS: Sighting of object is reliable for it has been seen by more than one person. Since the interview has seen the object twice. It appears that the object can only be seen in Thibodaux for no other reports have been received in surrounding areas nor can it be seen from Houma. We were unable to detect any object on our radar. FAA has an airway, (V-22) over Thibodaux, and stated that VFR aircraft use it, but they could not confirm any scheduled aircraft at times of sightings.
