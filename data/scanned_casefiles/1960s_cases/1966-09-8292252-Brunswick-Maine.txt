The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which provides details about a sighting event that occurred on September 3, 1966 in Brunswick, Maine. The text in the report describes the observations made by the witnesses, including the description of the objects seen in the sky. The report also notes that the observations were consistent with that of an astro(S/P), but does not provide any further details or identification of the observed objects.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn illustration and diagrams related to a UFO sighting report. The illustration depicts a curved sky with a compass-like dial, and the text below the image provides instructions for the viewer to imagine and draw sketches related to the UFO sighting.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show its position when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  17  /  10  /  66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. This report was sent to my adminis- trator and I was told that the sighting was not for the Air Force. I agree with my adminis- trator that inasmuch as traditional objects were seen in Canada, I do not feel this would be of interest to the Air Force. The objects ware observed to move both horizontally and erratically, and appeared to stop and remain motionless for short periods of time, before continuing on. We feel this is not for the fact that traditional objects were seen, and we appreciate your consideration in this matter.
