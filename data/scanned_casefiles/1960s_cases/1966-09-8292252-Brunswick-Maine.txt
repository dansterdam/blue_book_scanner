Astro(S/P) âœ“

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Five

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
14 hours

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers watched star like objects in the sky. Four objects were in line NE and one was in the NW. The color of the objects was like that of a star, with red and green lights around it. The objects were round, did not move and appeared to have no perturbations, wings, or tails. One witness said that the objects looked like bright stars and in the color change was similar to heat waves rising. Looking through binoculars only made the objects appear larger and brighter. One of the observers has reported the same type objects to Pease AFB on five occasions in June 1966. The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    17    10    166
                                                     Day   Month  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. This report was sent to my summer home in Brunswick, Maine, and the report was found when we went to close the house. This explains the delay.

Here - to note the fact that identical objects were seen in Chocorua, i. e. in June, I might not have noticed these. The objects seen in Chocorua behaved differently, in that they had a slow drifting motion not of the time, but on the second night slowly were observed they moved both horizontally and perpendicularly with fantastic speed. I reported, by telephone, the June sightings to Hanscom AFB in Portsmouth, N. H., but there was no follow up.
