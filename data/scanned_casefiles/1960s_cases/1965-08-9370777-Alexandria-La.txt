Here is the text I can read from the document:

[First few lines are partially illegible]

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

WEST. F. NUGENT, LTG, USAF, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 4 IST

THEY SURE TO NOTE PERSONS REGARDING THAT STORY AND ALTHOUGH THEY
HOPE BOTH SURE THEY SAW SOMETHING, NEITHER WAS ABLE TO GIVE AN EXACT
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THEY SAW. THE OBJECT IN QUESTION WAS AT SOME
DISTANCE FROM THEM, AND ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER WAS GOOD AND THE SKY
CLEAR, THEY WERE UNABLE TO GIVE A BETTER ACCOUNT OF THE OBJECT.
CONSEQUENTLY OF AIRCRAFT IS NOT HELD OUT, BUT COULD NOT EXPLAIN
THE LOSS PLUS OCCURRENCE, SUCH THE ISSUE OF THIS.

Note: Some parts of the text are difficult to read clearly, so I have transcribed what I could make out as accurately as possible.
