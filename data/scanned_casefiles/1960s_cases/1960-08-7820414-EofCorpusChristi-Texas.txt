   (5) Sound: none.
   (6) No other features.

b. Description of course of object:
   (1) Unknown.
   (2) Bearing 000 true altitude 38°, at 0312z, moving eastward
   (3) Time of disappearance: 0325z, bearing 045°, true altitude, 15°.

d. Time and date of sighting:
(1) 0312, 18 aug 1960.
(2) Light conditions: night.

e. Location of observers: 27-36'N, 95-23'W

f. Identity of observers: OOD and CO, Coast Guard District Eight.

g. Weather and winds aloft: surface - 60.0 160/10, 10,000 14,715, 16,000 140/10, 20,000 110/05, 30,000 340/15, 50,000 350/25, 80,000 90/25, ceiling 2500' scattered and high scattered, visibility twelve miles, amount of cloud cover 3/10 lower clouds, 2/10 high clouds, thunderstorms in area - none.

h. No other unusual activity or conditions existed.

i. None.

j. Location, approximate altitude and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which could possibly account for sighting: at approximately 0315Z the satellite ECHO I passed over the city of Houston, Texas, on an eastward path.

k. The base operations officer prepared this report. A telephonic check with the Houston Tower, 7470th Support Group, Houston Approach radar and Ellington Tower, and a check of their logs during the period of the observations, revealed no unusual traffic. In other reports have been received at this station. The flight path of the object closely approximates that of ECHO I satellite. It is well within the clear element, in the opinion of the reporting officer that the object was the ECHO I satellite.
