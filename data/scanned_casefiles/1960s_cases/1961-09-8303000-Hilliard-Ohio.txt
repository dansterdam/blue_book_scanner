Gentlemen:

I am sending a report on an object which I saw. My four sons were in the car with me at the time. We all saw the object, but just my son who is mine, really had any idea what it was.

We did not see it long enough to get a good look at it. I have read books on "Flying Saucers" and the U.S. Air Force, so I answered the questions taken from the book "Flying Saucers" and the U.S. Air Force".

I hope this will help in some small part to solve this intriguing phenomenon.

Yours truly,
Mrs. [Redacted]
