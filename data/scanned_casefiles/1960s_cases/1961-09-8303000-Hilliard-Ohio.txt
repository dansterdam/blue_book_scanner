10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Appeared to stand still at first, suddenly speeding up turned and changed, brightness and flickering was brought. Was a golden gleam then a big white ball. Size of grapefruit at arm's length.

11. COMMENTS
It is possible that obj of sight was just Mars. Mars was just on or below horizon within witness horizon and was brought into view by atmospheric refraction. Planet was not very bright at this time, having a magnitude of only +1.9, but this is a relatively bright obj and coupled w/effects of refraction appeared as a very bright moving disc to observer. Description and apparent motions are same as objs under circumstances of atmospheric refraction.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon

Gentlemen:

I am sending a report on an object which I saw. My four sons were in the car with me at the time. They saw the object too, but just my son who is nine, really had any idea what it was.

I had no official form to fill out so I just answered the questions taken from the book, "Flying Saucers and the U. S. Air Force".

I hope this will help in some small part to solve this intriguing phenomenon.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
Mrs.

21. I do not wish to guess at the size.

22. The object appeared to be as large as a grapefruit held in the hand at arms' length. Of this, I am fairly certain.

23. It rose up into the sky and sped away.

24. When the object was near the ground it looked like a gleaming Japanese lantern. When it was about a mile up, it looked like a shiny milk-white ball.

25. I was located outdoors when I observed it.

26. I was in the open countryside.

27. At the time I saw the object, I was driving the car. The object appeared to be hanging over the road directly in front of me. I wondered what that light was doing in the middles of the road.

28. 1. I was traveling west. 2. I was driving at ten mph. 3. I stopped to look at the object.

29. I was looking west when I saw the object.

30. I was looking north when I last saw the object.

31. I know nothing about bearing terms.

32. [A hand-drawn diagram showing a curved trajectory]

33. [Another hand-drawn diagram showing a curved line over a landscape with some markings]

34. The weather conditions: clear sky and slight breeze. Dry and cool.

35. I reported this to no one. I have read too much on the subject, and don't care to be labeled a "nut" or a "fool".

36. Someone else was with me. My four sons. They saw it and pointed to it but as witnesses they would never do. They did say it looked like something in the space movies they saw on television.

37. This is the first time I have ever seen an object. I have read extensively on the subject, was not afraid, and remembered most of the things you are supposed to about the weather, etc.

38. I do not know what the object was. If anyone does, I wish they would tell me.

Analysis and Conclusions:
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS THE PLANET MARS. THE PLANET WAS JUST ON OR NEAR THE HORIZON. THE WITNESSES OBSERVED AND WAS BROUGHT INTO VIEW OF ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION. THE PLANET WAS NOT VERY BRIGHT AT THIS TIME, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST A MAGNITUDE OF ONLY 1.9, BUT THIS IS A RELATIVELY BRIGHT OBJECT AND COMPARED WITH THE EFFECTS OF REFRACTION WAS

people of this country or at least the ones who wish to know. I think that the misinformation that is being peddled is causing more fear and trepidation among the people than the truth would.

39. I cannot estimate the speed. I do know that it left faster than I have ever seen a jet go over.

40. I would say I was about 1000 feet away from the object.

Here is the text from the document:

Arrived as a deep recent moving
disc to the observer. The
description or the object, its
movement, shows the all characteristic
of objects viewed under the
clear strikes of atmospheric refraction.
It is considered that the maker
maps of the sighting, distorted
by the atmospheric sight, not
came of this sighting.

The position of the planet
at the time of the sighting
coincides with that reported
for the UFO.
