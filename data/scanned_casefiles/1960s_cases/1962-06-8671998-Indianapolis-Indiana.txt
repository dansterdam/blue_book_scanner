MEMO FOR RECORD:

On 11 July at 1000 T/Sgt Moody called to/Col King and received the following additional information:

Time of sighting was verified at about 4 AM. The sun was up and no stars were visible, as a check with the ephemeris had indicated.

The interval between the sighting of the various objects was clarified. The first object was viewed for about 3 minutes. The time between the first object and the second object was 30 seconds. The time between the second and third object was 10 seconds, with the third object trailing the first object by about 3 minutes. Total sighting time was about 3 or 4 minutes.

The navigator did not see the objects at any time. The ball gunner on the aircraft witnessed this first object, and the second and third. No change in the objects at any time. They were observed through 3 different windows of the aircraft (the observer is positive of this). It was estimated that the first object was of about the magnitude of a second magnitude star. The second and third were of about the same brightness.

The motion was constant as all times. There was no change in speed and the flight was level and straight. The first object, originally at about the 9:30 position from the aircraft at an elevation of about 75 degrees. Its path was described and it faded or disappeared at a 9:30 position. Then the second and third objects had identical paths in that the third was following the second, with no evidence on the distance from the aircraft. The second and third objects were observed to move in a horizontal path at 60 degree elevation. Apparently, they began in the clouds at the 5 o'clock position. All positions are relative to the heading of the aircraft (approximately 133 degrees).

Observer has seen meteors before and is positive that this could not be a meteor. The objects are moving in the wrong direction for satellites. Nearest thing to a trail, but the flare was absent.
