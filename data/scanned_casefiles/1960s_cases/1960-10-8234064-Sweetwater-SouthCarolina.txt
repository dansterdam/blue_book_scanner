and the field outside the window. The light was white and
and he stated he was "very frightened" by it. The field
outside the house was sparsely covered with dead corn
stalks, around the area of flying the approach of
corn field. The field is approximately 150 feet deep
and 200 yards wide. Stalks of corn would not block his
vision, but a small object in front could be the point

the top of a tree nearby.

2. (1) [Partially illegible text]
after the [illegible] first has too [illegible] to go out
of bed fell. He went to bed, but could not rest, so he
got up and went out into the field about midnight.
(Continued in 5th copy). The next morning (13
October), he went to the house of [blacked out]
[blacked out] Fort Garden, S.C., on his way back after
[illegible] around the area. He found a small object
in the 13th and scanning the area.

He saw a small object
about size of a marble, located in the sand. He
picked it up and a piece of clay with it. He put this
clay scratched a few inches into the soil like a
child to a marker. These objects were not compared
by a laboratory, but the "marble" is very light in weight.
It has no plastic content. It appears to be less or plastic
and has what appears to be a small hole. It was
easily accepted up with the "soil" is included. The ring
was about one inch deep in the soil when found, and the
marble was located 4-5 feet away, but visible.

Although subsequent examination may show the object to
be from a source unknown to the investigating officers, it
appears that the marble may be from a roll-on deodorant,
and the plug may be a washer lost, buried in the soil. A
pile of junk and garbage is scattered over a wide area
extending about 50-75 feet up the side of the hill from
the point where the object was found.

It was the opinion of the investigating officer ques-
tioning that no one in his home was a roll-on
deodorant and never has to his knowledge. It is pos-
sible that a prior resident did discard a small roll-on
applicator some time ago. The ball is a tan deodorant
applicator has the same appearance, and the same type
of material finds it.

3. It is the opinion of the investigating officer that the re-
ported UFO sighting was definitely an occurrence of a nat-
ural phenomenon. In this case the object being either a meteor
or the return from orbit of a satellite or a similar launch-
ing vehicle which burned up in a county. The Anthony
testimony is submitted in support of this conclusion.

(1) Capt. [blacked out] after interview with
officers of the 9th Air Squadron, Mitch Air, S.C., stat-
ed that about 1930 on 12 Oct 60, he was out in the
field studying a meteor. He was with [blacked out]
and [blacked out] were studying outside. [blacked out]
also, S.C., states the meteor sighting.
Closed with information that Capt. [blacked out] in
the object burned with various colors, etc.

nothing.

(9) Yes, answer as previously to. (C) below.

(1) (C) Observer was sitting at his window facing the field
Richards to the radio. I briefly light up the sky
and the field outside. He window. The field was well
and he stated he was "very" confidential by it. The field
outside the house was sparsely covered with dead corn
stalks, ground flat and flying the perimeter of a
corn field. The field is approximately 150 feet deep
and 200 yards wide. Stalks of corn would not block his
vision, but a small graph has been used to give point
of the window as you look out partially hindered vision.
Ideal the view would not have hampered vision enough to
have view of the object as it was described to me. The field
is placed by trees.

(2) [Redacted] looking through the window observed the
object at an elevation of about 25 degrees from the horizon toward the North-northeast. He first saw it near
the top of a tree nearby.

minus 25 degrees which (out of) the window (foreground)
when it disappeared. "Whereas" said in "disappeared"
is apparent to be a typographical error, at this point, at
this point the light went out. (See (6))

Object made no maneuver.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(5) Object continued until a very bright light until
it came close to the ground. It then became stationary
a point about 100 yards above the ground. At this time
the object emitted a bright flash of "energy" as described, and then suddenly the light went out. It was
as if the object vanished a last trace or energy before
disappearing.

(6) Observer estimated the object was visible eight to
twelve seconds. He said object was not traveling very
swiftly. He estimated a speed of about 15 to 10 miles
per hour.

c. (1) Ground signal. No optical data noted.

d. (2) [Partially redacted text with blacked out sections]

house. Location is 33 degrees 30 minutes north, 81 degrees
58 minutes west. George will 10/12/59, Tuesday, 25 September, S.C. was contacted outside the claims plants

(7) Investigating officer estimate of reliability.
Observer is reportedly an illiterate farmer, unable to write
local persons intelligibly, but was coherent and seemed
still able from the investigator's opinion. He appeared as being very sincere and anxious to give
correct information. The chief is giving no credence
to the story. With all respect to the individual, he did
not seem convincing. The investigator did not place
too much weight to the story, but did note the individual
was quite willing, tense and somewhat at stake in the
object. The story has been recorded as received.

The image appears to be a document with multiple sections of text redacted or blacked out. While some text is visible, much of the document is obscured by black rectangles.

2. (1) [partially illegible text]... of first has too witnessed to go out
into the yard and examine the area. He was ill and fell. He went to bed, but could not rest, so he
ask up and went out into the field about midnight.

(2) [partially obscured text] (October), he went to the house of [obscured]
[obscured] Fort Carson, Mo., on [illegible text]

Although subsequent examination may show the objects to
be from a natural source, no final identifying characteristics
appears that the object may be from a roll-on deodorant,
and the play may be a waiver leg, part of a toy soil.
The point of impact where the object was found was a wide area
extending about 50-75 feet up the side of the hill from
the point where the object was found.

It is the opinion of the investigating officer that the reported PO sighting was definitely in observance of a natural process. In this case the object being either a meteor
or the return from orbit of a satellite or a similar launched vehicle, which burned up in entry.

(1) Capt. [obscured text] interviewed witnesses of the 16th Air Squadron, [location obscured]

The document contains multiple sections with some text obscured or blacked out, and some text is partially illegible. The page appears to be discussing an investigation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting, with analysis suggesting the object might be a natural phenomenon like a meteor or satellite debris.
