SUBJECT:  12 March 1969 call from Ronald T. Lumpkin

On 12 March 1969, IDFT (UFO) received a call from [redacted]. He stated that at approximately 0610 hrs he observed two objects that looked like stars. One object was brighter than the other. Mr. [redacted] was looking to the North when he spotted the objects. The angular elevation of the brighter object was originally 60°, then 35°, then 45°. The angular elevation of the dimmer object was initially 55°, then 35°. The objects were last seen at 0715 hrs in the North. He said they disappeared with daylight. On 13 March 1969 an AF Form 117 was sent to Mr. [redacted] at the following address:
