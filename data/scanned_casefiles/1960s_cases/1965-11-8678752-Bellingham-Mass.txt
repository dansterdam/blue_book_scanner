Dear Sir:

On the night of 5 November 1963, at approximately 2030 hours, I observed a large bright pulsating red light fixed in the sky at about 15 degrees in a southerly direction looking towards "Bunnocket R.I." From the above address, I summoned my wife and two visiting friends-Mr. and Mrs. W. to witness. The same, we all watched it as another came into view from the east and hovered momentarily and then slowly moved towards the first and seemed to merge with it into one large pulsating light. They held this position for a few moments and then one object left towards the west. As this was happening a third object came into view from the east and became motionless along side the first. It is to be noted that not a sound was heard.

At this point, approximately 2045 hours, Mr. [redacted] and I sped down to a clearing off of Hartford Ave. and Farm Street, to get a better view. We were watching the second light, a Southward direction when no ordinary method two huge red glowing oval shaped lights, with smaller white light integrated between them, coming at us from the S.W. and real low, just over the tree tops. Then it got almost over us we could just make out a blunt nose fuselage, silvery in appearance. As it slowly but steadily glided overhead the only sound to be heard was that of air rushing over it. We could then see only two white lights spaced apart in a horizontal plane as it headed towards the N.E. at the same low altitude and disappeared from view. The second object, still at a distance, soon moved off in an arc towards the N.W.

Just prior to leaving for the cleared area I had loaded a roll of 8mm color, outdoor, 135, movie film in my camera and had attempted to film the above mentioned low flying object it while open lens. However, since I forgot to run the loader thru prior to this, I doubt very much if I was successful in obtaining anything as my footage simulator shows that only the leader was exposed. In any case the film is still in the camera, and when it is exposed I will attempt to have it specially processed to include the leader in the event I may have gotten something worthwhile.

In closing I would like to point out that I have witnessed these strange maneuvering red pulsating objects in this area over the past few months, except that, in the past, they appeared singularly.

Sincerely yours,
