Dear Sir,

I am a fieldman in El Campo, Tex. and I
along with other friends have been keeping
Data on UFO's so I would like to hear
a little information about a certain except
if at least all is possible by the Div. Div.
On Oct. 6 1965 I spotted a clicking
sound with object in the sky. It had no
exhaust vapor in any type of type running
vehicle over. It was traveling in a cir-
cle pattern and when it completed about
3 of the circle it fired a rather blasting
light from the left side proving two
objects then as they completed the
check these engines came on for a bout
1 minute and then quit and they
glided in the circular pattern and
came together and on the blinking light
that was just from the exit they went
in the other side only can object you'll
it done so what I want to know if you

I put on my needle of that flight and we
saw some aircraft as an UFO of my
writing on this report I have a brief observation
I feel not clear to
public thing to take if you will
send me some information on UFOs and
as well they started and captured space
time would be sent to me and the
natural phenomena of these flying lights
I suppose could be sent, which I don't
because they went quiet a bit away
to send this not very important to have the
picture but I would like to have the
brief information, asked Lee would be sent
to me it will be greatly appreciated

H. duration of the flight was
time: 7:30 PM
Place: El Campo, Texas
Date: Oct. 16, 1965
Pattern: Particular pattern
was bright and was a little longer than a
star

Here is the text I can read from the document:

N

W

First and last
object

Where lights
form in last

This is not the exact with it
flight direction supposed, and it

S

The document appears to be a hand-drawn diagram with compass directions (N, W, E, S) and arrows showing movement of an object, with some annotations about lights and object positioning.
