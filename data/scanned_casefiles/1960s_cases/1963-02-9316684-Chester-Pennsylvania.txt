Dear Sir,

I would like to report the sighting of a U.F.O. "Fly Saucer" over Chester, Penna., on Feb 6th, at 2-10 P.M. which I observed for over 10 minutes before it took off heading north. I saw this through 10 50 binoculars and your Jots were also up at the same time and I presume they were looking for the U.F.O. I saw my first Saucer in 1937 and have been a sky watcher ever since. In 1950 I saw 14 of these Saucers, but since then they have seemed to stop coming around this part of the country. I do hope before I die I find out where they come from and who is running them and maybe we will someday.

Sincerely yours,
Mr. [redacted]
Chester, Penna.
