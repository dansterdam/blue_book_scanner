1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 8 Oct 64, 2002

2. LOCATION: Overton, Nevada

10. CONCLUSION: Balloon

The vivid description and realistic drawing seemed to indicate an apparent sighting of an upper air research balloon.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer was looking for the coast though 7750 binoculars when the object appeared as a brilliant white object. Silver appeared, first thought of as evening star, but was too high. Most of object appeared to be above the horizon. Object appeared stationary in the area 15Â° above horizon of eastern part of moon. Object appeared to be stationary and a good bit above the ground. Observer looked away with others who were watching along. Long silvery plume with a dark object at its base and the plume seemed to be rising, that looking part moving upward. Gradually toward the south, the place seemed to tremble and drift rapidly toward earth.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: FDEW/UFO

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Overton, Nevada

TO: Hq USAF SAOOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the attached letter from Mrs [redacted] requesting information on her unidentified observation. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear Mrs [redacted]:

Your very vivid description and realistic drawing presented, indicate an apparent sighting of an upper air research balloon as it bursts. Balloons of this nature are launched by the U S Navy from Chico, California, and are generally programmed to fly between 80,000 feet and 125,000 feet. They can be destroyed at predetermined times by users of destructors attached to the balloon. The instrument package is then returned to Earth by a parachute. Balloons of this type are used in upper air research studies.

In the past, observations of this nature have assisted in recovery of the instrument packages associated with these projects. We wish to thank you for presenting this observation to the Air Force.

Dear

Your very vivid description and realistic drawing presented, indicate an apparent sighting of an upper air research balloon as it bursts. Balloons of this nature are launched by the U S Navy from Chico, California, and are generally programmed to fly between 30,000 feet and 125,000 feet. They can be destroyed at a predetermined time by use of detonators attached to the balloon.

The instrument package is then returned to Earth by parachute. Balloons of this type are used in upper air research studies.

In the past, observations of this nature have assisted in recovery of the instrument packages associated with these projects.

We wish to thank you for presenting this observation to the Air Forces.

Here is the text from the document:

TO DO

I feel "foolish" for trying to report this...it perhaps is of no importance...but I would feel more foolish if it was important and I had not done so!

Saturday afternoon, Oct. 1965

I was looking for my cat, with "17:50" time was almost full darkness, and had just to observe a silver flier (meteor?) but as we were west of town. This object was much larger and brighter it appeared "relatively" the same size as the center in every direction. Just after the jet passed over horizon.

Classes, that appeared to be a plane of white glow objects or the eye of the craft or it, then to "swish" swiftly across. I took my eyes away to check on relative position in order to see if it got near where watching and when I realized it or again the ground to various having a long silvery fine-white glow object at its top...and then ABOVE IT was an extremely fast, having them leaving "west" flashing then the air faster than we could move or see, moving in a southerly direction. The "glow" began to come into view toward the south (I presume) and vanished. A few moments later a very slow moving object, the dot east, moved across the horizon between us and the trees were the others had a course.
