TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference is made to the attached letter from Mrs informing on her unidentified observation. The following is a summary reply:

Your very vivid description and realistic drawing presented, indicates an apparent sighting of an upper air research balloon as it bursts. Balloons of this nature are launched by the U.S. Navy and Army Chemical Corps, generally programmed to fly between 80,000 feet and 125,000 feet. They can be destroyed at predetermined times by detonators attached to the balloon.

Over the past, observations of this nature have assisted in a better understanding of the instrument packages associated with these projects.

We wish to thank you for presenting this observation to the Air Force.

Reference the attached letter from information on this unidentified observation. The following is presented:

Your very vivid description and realistic drawing presented, indicates an operation similar to an upper air research balloon as it bursts. Balloons of this nature are launched by the U.S. Air Force generally programmed to fly between 30,000 feet and 125,000 feet. They can be destroyed by ground stations determined to the balloon's position.
In the past, observations of this nature have assisted in recovery of the instrument packages associated with these projects.
We wish to thank you for presenting this observation to the Air Force.

TO DO
I feel "unspeakable" was a poor word to use as a description, as I would not feel comfortable speaking those words. I would feel sad, and think of the implications of such a word.  

In this case, the witnessed event seems very unusual, and I can understand the witness feeling at a loss for how to describe it. The witness provides many details about the object, its movement, and what was experienced. While the language used is strong, I think the witness is simply trying to convey the profound nature of what they witnessed.

Some key details from the text:
- The event occurred on 8/6/1945 (likely a typo for 1965)
- The object was described as about 75-80 feet in diameter
- It hovered at an altitude of about 800 feet
- It moved in an accelerated, erratic pattern, seeming to defy gravity
- It made no sound and gave off no exhaust or vapor trail
- The witness felt a sense of dread and unease observing the object

Overall, this appears to be a detailed firsthand account of an unusual aerial phenomenon witnessed by the author. While the language used is strong, the witness seems to be trying to convey the extraordinary nature of what they saw.
