PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 June 66  23/0552

2. LOCATION: Columbus, Mississippi

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Visual- 51 minutes, Radar- 4 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual (Radar)

7. COURSE: Stationary

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Unknown. Insufficient data
    - Insufficient data for evaluation
    - Additional information requested from witness, but to date this has never been received. With the existing information a comprehensive evaluation is not possible.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
    Object was cylinder in shape, one foot in diameter and about two feet long. Object was basically green in color but had a red light on top that appeared to rotate. The red light would disappear at regular intervals. Object was picked up by Columbus RAGEON but failed from view in four minutes. There were aircraft in the area however none at 10,000 feet where the radar had a paint.

Other radar in the area failed to paint an object. Witness was to forward a personal account of the visual sighting but to date has not received such. Radar analysis indicates a false target was the likely reason for the radar paint.

MEMO TO
ATTN OF: TDEER/Mr. Bryant/pkj/70401
SUBJECT: UFO Evaluation                                                   25 Oct 66

TO: TDETR (Maj Quintanilla)

1. The information pertaining to the radar portion of this sighting is insufficient to support a meaningful analysis. Specifically, the only facts were that a stationary target was observed on the radar for 15-20 minutes, (visually, apparently, for 51 minutes) at a range of 25 NM, 40,000 feet, at 140 degrees, and disappeared at 10447.

2. With no course information, speeds, etc., reported there is no possible way of pinpointing a material target. If there were one. A case can be made for a possible weather balloon or false target due to weather conditions inasmuch as there was negligible wind velocity at 0455 (zero at the surface), which would allow a balloon to remain stationary, and there was a definite temperature inversion at about 43,000 feet, or approximately the altitude of the "target", which might give a false target on the radar. Of the two possibilities, the false target seems more feasible, since presumably the balloon would be tracked before and after the period of observation. A balloon would not be expected to be lit up (visually) as this target was, while on the other hand, it may be possible that conditions which would give a false indication may give false indications in the visual spectrum as well.
