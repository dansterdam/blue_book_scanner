Here is the text from the document:

was good, very cool as the atmosphere was cool and dry. the objects were just as brilliant, with that possible clear parts of the sky as cloudy. what changed my mind as to whether they were jets, light reflection, satellites, meteors or balloons was when they stopped in mid air and lowered in altitude and then proceeded on their course. when the objects lowered they made no sound either then or in horizontal flight. there was no visible exhaust, and they had the appearance of the large base balls. the entire sighting took about a minute and a half.

Submission of UFO Reports
(Captain Hinderer)                                                  21 APR 1961

SAFOI-34 (Major Coleman)

1. On 10 April 1961 ATIC received a letter from Captain Donald L. Hinderer of Canton, Ohio requesting information concerning the methods and qualifications for submitting reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects.

2. It is suggested that your office answer Captain Hinderer's letter and include the following information:

    a. There are no special qualifications required for persons submitting UFO reports. However, if a witness does possess some special qualification, i.e., astronomer, this should be included in the report.

    b. It is preferable that UFO reports be made to the nearest Air Force installation or organization in order that their entry into Air Force channels will be expedited. However, reports may be made to SAFOI-34, Washington 25, D. C., or ATIC, ATTN: AFCIN-4b, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

3. Mr. Hinderer signs his name with the title Captain, but it is the ATIC opinion that this is probably a position in some private UFO organization and not military.

4. Captain Hinderer's address follows:
