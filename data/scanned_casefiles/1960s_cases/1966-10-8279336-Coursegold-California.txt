PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 9 Oct. 66   10/0001Z
2. LOCATION: Coursegold, California   multiple

3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Several

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Varied
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: Varied
8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient data for evaluation

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers have been watching a pulsating and glowing light varying between shades of white, red, and green, occasionally remaining stationary on a nearby ridge and capable of moving in any direction at varying speeds.

One observer says he has been watching these objects since the fall of 1960, but only in the last three weeks had he noticed the sudden increase in the frequency of these objects.

Castle AFB was to forward information as required in AFR PO-17 but to date this information has not been received; therefore, the case is being carried as insufficient data.
