The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a document titled "PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD" which includes information about a UFO sighting that occurred on May 13, 1964 in Denver, Colorado. The document provides details about the sighting, such as the type of observation (visual), the source (civilian), the duration of the observation (15-20 minutes), and the comments about the sighting (a white light observed overhead in flight, and a request for additional information).
