35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object hovered. We stopped and watched it on the north end of the compass (state loc) over Interstate to just north of Atkins. It came toward us. We started back to Denois house and it pursued us. All of this time it was very bright. When we'd stop it'd stop. It followed us all the way to her house. We took Mrs. Holloway out to where we first saw it. It followed us halfway out there. On the way back to the house it started following us again. It hovered over the trees west of her house and finally disappeared.

It would get real bright and real dim when we were stopped.

Sincerely,

[The signature and name are redacted with black marker]
