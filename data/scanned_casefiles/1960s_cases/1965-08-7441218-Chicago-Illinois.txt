COMMENT: Observer was a 15 year old student. Student had been staring through scope approximately 1 hour before sighting. Power of telescope was only 200X. This reporter feels the power of telescope and short duration of sighting is not sufficient to see object land on moon.

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

I have just located my misfiled notes of August 11, 1965. On that day 2330 hours I observed UFO travelling from South to North about 85 degrees above the Eastern horizon in the sky just west of Cassiopeia.

At 2345 hours I observed UFO travelling west to East about 85 degrees above the Northern horizon. Rate of travel about 40 seconds to travel 50 degrees of arc.

I was familiar with 2330 having observed it many times the past three years. This UFO was not as bright and seemed to be travelling much faster than 2330 which I had just observed 15 minutes before.

Position of observer: five miles south of 42 degrees 36 minutes N and 88 degrees 23 minutes West.

The above just for the record.

Yours truly,

Line:79

COMMENT: It is my opinion that the object Mr [redacted] saw was a late model jet type aircraft making an approach for landing on runway-22L or 22R at Chicago's Midway airport. These runways are in an almost direct line with the observation point. His description of the altitudes, sound and course of the object would tend to confirm this in my mind.

COMMENT: I feel that Miss was observing the Boeing 727 that crashed into Lake Michigan the night of 16 - 17 August 1965. As I understand it after talking to Mr Ed Jensen (FAA - CE ACD 31) the last contact with the airliner was at about 2117 or 2120 CDT that evening. The time as given by Miss was at about 2115 hours. I believe that Miss was in fact an eye-witness to the last moments of this airliner.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS BY MR. ANDERSON OF THE WEATHER STATION AT MIS CENTER, ILL.

LINES: Cyclonic circulation over MY disc, starting at 3000 extending into
the Troposphere.

Was across an order: Northern British Columbia, East to
Saskatchewan into North Dakota to Arkansas then Tennessee to the border of
South Carolina then to see 33° Latitude then up thru the Eastern portion of
the U.S. 37°76' then Northwest to Greenland. 3000 & 2000.

CITING: While interviewing [redacted] my impression was that he wasn't
one given to "flights of fancy". He told his story straight and to the
point with little or no hesitation. At first he asked if he knew of any
satellite that would have been in the area of observation at the time of
the observation. In my opinion the coloration of the reported object
would discount an aircraft but could possibly have indicated a satellite.

Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
IMAGINATION

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Oval object sharp on ends, silver color, slowing down apparent to moon landing. Had exhaust for 5-10 seconds. Disappeared by fading.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
30 Seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual(200X TX)

COMMENTS: Observer had been looking through TX for over one hour. 200 X Telescope would not give sufficient visibility to see object land on moon unless extremely large. No other reports from reliable astronomers who watch or monitor moon studies of this reported event. Evaluated as imagination due to fatigue caused by long period of observation.

7. COURSE
Object landing on Moon
