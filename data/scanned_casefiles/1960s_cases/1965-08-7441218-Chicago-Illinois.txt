Major HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
USAF 4602 DID BROOK PARK ROAD
DAYTON, OHIO

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I have just located my mislaid notes of our conversation of about two months ago, concerning a USAF object, which was observed in the sky just west of Cassapolis.

At about 0545 hours 8 December 1964, this UFO was observed by me from my backyard for about 45 seconds to 1 minute. It was about 65 to 70 degrees above the northern horizon, moving in a southerly direction. The size of the object appeared to be about 1/3 that of the full moon, and it had a distinct orange-red glow. I was familiar with USAF having observed it many times before. This sighting was called in to the USAF within 1 hour. 

I regret I did not hear from you in the matter, and I trust the above just for the record.

Yours truly, 
[REDACTED]

COMMENT: I feel that what I was observing was the Boeing 727 that crashed into Miss XXXX on August 16, 1965. As I understand after talking to R.C. Jansen (FAA - CS-ACCO 33), the last contact with the airliner was at about 0117 GMT on 16 August on Frequency: 123.5. The airliner was last seen on radar by Miss XXXX who was an eye-witness to the last moments of this airliner.

INITIALS _3.9_

UNUSUAL REMARKS AT UR ADDITION OF THE INITIAL UFO REPORT ON CASE NO. 38-M, DATED 22 JULY 1965. WEATHER CIRCULATIO N OVER CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, COOLING AT 2000 OVER CHICAGO INTO A COLD FRONT. AT 2230 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, UNUSUAL SIGHTING OF BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING NORTHWARD SOUTH OF CHICAGO AT HIGH VELOCITY.
LOCATION: While interviewing [REDACTED] my impression was that he wasn't giving me the whole story. He seemed to be holding back information. At first he stated he noticed a bright light in the sky and didn't know what it was. After further questioning, he admitted he had watched the light for some time and it appeared to maneuver or change direction rapidly at high speed, something that was not characteristic of any conventional aircraft. He stated it made a sharp turn at one point, impossible for any known aircraft. In my opinion the coloration of the reported object would discount an identification as the reported object would discount an identification as the planet Venus which was visible in the sky at that time. I cannot discount an intelligent control of the observation.
