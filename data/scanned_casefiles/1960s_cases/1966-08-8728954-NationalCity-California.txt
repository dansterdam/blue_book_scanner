Over Pennsylvania, Ohio

Police reported receiving more than 250 telephone calls within 20 minutes of the meteor.

A spokesman at Lockbourne Air Force Base near Columbus, Ohio, also reported the base received numerous calls.

The Allegheny Observatory said the meteor appeared in the sky at 12:53 a.m.

"The tail was visible for four seconds, and it changed in color from white to blue to orange," the observatory said.

Initial reports indicated the meteor was visible over an area of more than 150 square miles. If moved in a northeasterly direction from a point southeast here in Westmoreland County to as far west as Columbus.

Observatory spokesmen said the meteor probably burned up in the earth's atmosphere. They said they received no reports of its striking the earth.

In Ohio, residents in the cities of Warren, Akron, Canton, and Jackson and Marion reported sighting the bright flash.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and appears to be a continuation of notes about some kind of observation or event, but due to the cursive handwriting, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire text without potentially introducing errors. The text appears to discuss some kind of scientific or technical observation, with references to methodology, data, and some form of analysis.]

The page is Page 7 of the document, and the handwritten section fills most of the page with dense cursive script.

This document appears to be a handwritten page, labeled "Page 8" at the top right. The text is written in cursive script and appears to be a letter or report. Here is the text as I can read it:

moment actually supporting a coincidence, but
obviously this instance was changed.

I was not totally disappointed, but certain

I thank you for the opportunity the supreme
truth. It truthfully

P.S. if the data don't jive, the two similar

Some words are difficult to read with complete certainty, so this transcription is my best interpretation.
