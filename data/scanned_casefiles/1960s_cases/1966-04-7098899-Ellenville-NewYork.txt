To whom this may concern,

On Friday April 8, 1966 a strange U.F.O. was spotted in Ellenville, New York, and was witnessed by four people. It was first spotted over a-mountain and slowly descended at a slight base of the mountain. It was a very strange transparent sort of shape like a space ship. It was as long as a quarter of the mountain.

It was first noticed from the third floor of the American Legion on the east side. We may as well be honest about it and tell you that it was not multi-colored like all those other ones spotted. It was an off colored white or yellow. You may not be interesting interested in this but we thought it only right to report it.
