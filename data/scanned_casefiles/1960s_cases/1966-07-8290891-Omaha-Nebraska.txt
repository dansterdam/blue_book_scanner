The document appears to be a meteorological or flight report with some details about cloud cover, altitude, and temperature, potentially related to a UFO sighting incident in Omaha, Nebraska in 1966.

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In reply to your letter of Aug. 4, enclosing four reports on objects seen night of July 13/14, 1966 from the Omaha, Neb. area, I have now gone over them carefully.

My opinion is that they refer to two objects, both quite obviously bright meteors i.e. fireballs.

The first has seven reports, for roughly 14/0400 plus Z, the other for 14/0600 Z-and that seems a very questionable as to observed data. This last seems quite untrustworthy. As for the other seven, they seem to refer to same object roughly pointing from SW towards S SE. The reports are more uncertain than usual, except for the excelsive duration given by five of the seven. But if a fireball lasts over 10 seconds, usually people tend to exaggerate the duration.

None of the objects have UFO characteristics; you may safely classify them as meteors. You will be glad to know that I now have the preliminary path of the April 25 fireball. Thank you again for your valuable help in that.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Charles P. Olivier

Dear Dr. Olivier,

Reference the attached unidentified flying object reports from the Nebraska area. These sightings appear to be meteor observations. However, we would appreciate whether your opinion on these particular observations as to whether or not you feel that they are meteors.

We still have not received any late reports from the Norfolk, Virginia area for 25 April 1966.

Any assistance you may be able to provide on the Nebraska sightings will be appreciated.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Gentlemen:

On Wednesday, July 13th approximately 10:10 pm I saw 16 niter in the South western Sky. We Noted 16 miles immediately observed to one side. The niter was held a cloud look for a moment or so. We saw it & Rey suggested to observe & Rey again, it turned in a southerly direction again a little to the east. I observed about 3 or 4 miles with the horizon. Observed white, red and blue flashes.

Sincerely yours,
