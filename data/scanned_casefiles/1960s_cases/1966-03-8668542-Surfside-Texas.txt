11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted the lights in two houses about 100 ms apart from each other and approximately one mile from the township, blink on and off very rapidly and at an intensity extremely brighter than normal. Immediately following this, all power was cut in the area. Also, the observers noticed after a tremendous blue flash of light had occurred approximately in the center of the two houses. Observers said was a waiting glow to the right of where the blue flash was seen. This object appeared to be about 300-500 feet above the ground. Another observer said the object had a orange glow and had windows. The UFO moved away at a fast rate of speed. Local power reported a blown transformer which was defective.

STATEMENT OF U.F.O. SIGHTING BY JOHN R. WEITLICH RM3 359-266 USCS:

WHILE STANDING ON THE BRIDGE ON QUARTERMASTER WATCH AT 0125S ON THE MORNING OF 3/28/66, I HAD BEEN STARING UNTHINKINGLY OUT THROUGH THE PORT-HOLES WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHTS IN TWO HOUSES ABOUT 100 YARDS APART FROM EACH OTHER AND APPROX ONE MILE DIRECT FROM OUR SHIP, BLINKED ON AND OFF VERY RAPIDLY AND AT AN INTENSITY EXTREMELY BRIGHTER THAN NORMAL, AS IF THESE TWO HOUSES IN PARTICULAR WERE COMPLETELY FLOODED FROM WITHIN BY FLUORESCENT LIGHTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS, ALL POWER WAS CUT IN THE AREA, WHICH I NOTICED AFTER A TREMENDOUS BLUE FLASH OF LIGHT HAD OCCURRED APPROX CENTER OF THESE TWO HOUSES. TO GET A CLEARER LOOK AT THE SITUATION, I THEN WENT OUT TO THE PORT SIDE WING OF THE BRIDGE AND NOTICED A DISTINCT WHITISH GLOW ABOUT 45 DEG TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE I HAD NOTICED THE BLUE FLASH. THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FROM 300 TO 500 FEET ABOVE GROUND, AND EMITTED AN "EERIE" GLOW OF WHITE LIGHT THAT APPEARED TO PULSATE IN ITS INTENSITY. I MUST SAY NOW I TRIED TO KID MYSELF INTO BELIEVING THIS WAS AN OBJECT OF SOME EARTHLY FORM BUT RULED THIS OUT AND INFORMED MY SUPERVISOR WHO WAS SITTING IN THE RADIO SHACK AT THIS TIME, THAT I SAW A U.F.O. AND I THEN POINTED IT OUT TO HIM. I WAS ORDERED TO IMMEDIATELY GET A CAMERA BUT UPON MY RETURN THE U.F.O. HAD DISAPPEARED, THUS MY STORY ENDS HERE.

STATEMENT MADE BY GLENN A. MUSHETT, RM1 326-518, U.S.C.G.:

"I WAS IN THE RADIO SHACK WORKING WHEN THE QUARTERMASTER OF THE WATCH REPORTED SEEING A BLUE FLASH IN THE SKY. THIS WAS ABOUT 1:35 AM LOCAL TIME. A FEW SECONDS LATER THE SHIP AND ENTIRE AREA HAD A POWER FAILURE. THE QUARTER MASTER WENT OUT ON THE BRIDGE, AND AS HE WALKED OUT HE REPORTED SEEING A UFO IN THE SKY. HE HOLLERED FOR SOMEONE ELSE SO I WENT OUT. AS SOON AS I WALKED OUT I SAW A VERY LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT WAS OVAL IN SHAPE. IT WAS GIVING OFF A ORANGE GLOW AND AROUND THE OBJECT ITSELF IT WAS GIVING OFF A BLUE LIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER SEEING IT THE BLUE STOPPED. I TOLD THE QUARTER MASTER TO GET SOME BINOCULARS, AND THEN TO GO BELOW AND GET A CAMERA. AS I OBSERVED THE UFO THROUGH BINOCULARS, I COULD SEE IT HAD PORTS OR WINDOWS. THESE WINDOWS WERE OPEN. AS I COULD SEE COMING FROM INSIDE THE UFO IT WAS GIVING OFF A DARK ORANGE GLOW. I MUST HAVE OBSERVED IT FOR ABOUT A MIN OR LONGER. THEN IT STARTED TO MOVE UP FROM ABOUT 500 FEET TO ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET VERY SLOWLY. AS IT REACHED SOMEWHERE AROUND A THOUSAND FEET THE ORANGE GLOW IT WAS GIVING OFF GOT LARGER, THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER BLUE FLASH THE ORANGE GLOW SUBSIDED AND THE UFO MOVED AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN SEVERAL SECONDS.

THE QUARTERMASTER AND ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE CREW AND MYSELF WAS WATCHING THE AREA TWO OBJECTS SHOT UP FROM THE GROUND AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECTS GAVE OFF A WHITE GLOW, BUT WHEN THEY GAVE NO TRAIL OR STREAM AS THEY MOVED UP. ALSO IN SEVERAL SECONDS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT."

1. Further investigation into the circumstances surrounding the power failure referred to in reference (a) was conducted by contacting MR. ECKENBERGER of the Houston Lighting and Power Company. This revealed the following information:

(a) On the early hours of 20 March 1966, the LEGARE was moored at the U. S. Coast Guard Station, Surfside, Texas. The ship was utilizing electrical power supplied by shore tie.

(b) A power failure occured at 0135, 20 March 1966, which encompassed the entire Surfside area. MR. ECKENBERGER reports that this was caused by a blown transformer on a power pole.

(c) The electric Company's night trouble crew replaced the line fuse before checking the poles, hoping that this would correct the situation. Several minutes later the fuse blew again. The trouble crew checked the poles in the area and found a defective transformer. It was repaired and power restored to the area. This sequence of events took approximately one hour.

2. The Coast Guardsmen who sighted the UFO report that:

(a) The visibility was good, and the Surfside Bridge could be clearly seen, a distance of about three miles.

(b) The first power failure occurred simultaneously with the sighting of the large UFO, mentioned in the original statements made by those Coast Guardsmen concerned. As this UFO rose slowly and then sped away, the power was restored.

(c) A few minutes after restoration the power died again. Then the two small UFO's (streaks of light shooting quickly up from the ground) were sighted. They rapidly disappeared.

(d) Some time later the electric company's repair truck was sighted with its rotating orange beacon and spotlight. It was recognized as a truck and it was not in the same location where the UFO had been seen.

Subj: UFO Sighting Statements

Ref: (a) Comdt (CPT) ltr dtd 13 AR 66

1. In accordance with paragraph 2 of reference (a), the following information is submitted:

(a) Moored to USCG dock, USCG Station, Freeport, Texas.

(b) Moored

(c) The time of the sighting was 0135, 20 March 1966. The majority of the crew was on liberty. The OOD was retired for the night. The Commanding Officer was at home.

The vessel was on B-2 SAR status. The QM of the watch, who observed the UFO, was standing his watch on the bridge. An off duty OOD, MUSHET, RM1 was in the radio shack, adjacent to the bridge writing letters. He also observed the phenomena. The third observer was VAN ORDEN, FA who was placing a ships generator on the line after a shore power failure.

The OOD was called, but the object had disappeared by that time.

(c) The Commanding Officer was contacted by telephone immediately after the incident occurred. He spoke with the OOD and all three observers. They were in a highly excited state and related their observations to him. None of the observers had been drinking.

The phenomenon was observed on Sunday morning, the same day that UFO's were observed in Houston, Texas and in Michigan. It is significant to note that the crew's sightings was reported to the Commanding Officer before other sightings had been made known to the public through the news media.

To assign a degree of credibility to such an incident when the assessor was not actually a witness is a difficult task, however the surrounding circumstances and the fact that one observer was a qualified OOD lends validity to the story. It is the opinion of this command that these men did indeed see some sort of flying object, although without having personally observed the UFO, to assess its origin or identity would be purely speculation.
