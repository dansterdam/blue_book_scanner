SAP-OICC/Miss Turnure/76526/May 6, 1969

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter of April 30, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we could not attempt to tell you what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. ALCORN
Major, USAF
Chief, 4171 Branch

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES APR. 21-27, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared in the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Maps. An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Science Center, Bldg. 12, Wash., Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by center of arrows: the locations of these areas are shown at 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time and dashed by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for this same period. Incomplete totals are missing. "*" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES APR. 28-MAY 4, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-millibar Height and Temperature Chart, the Significant and Low Level Precipitation Chart. All of the charts are on a single page of this publication. They are copied from corresponding maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Maps. Explanatory notes are available and may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Inquiries, Washington, D.C. 20235, Bulletin 62-143. Bulk copies may also be obtained at a cost of $2.50 per 50 copies. Orders should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart shows maximum and minimum values for the 24 hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. i.a.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. i.a.t. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are by the same period. Incomplete totals are indicated by "T", indicating a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The Surface Weather Map presents surface data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. i.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by crosses of very few locations. Isobars may be indicated by small black squares enclosing white spaces. Weather areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports for the period here are only those from the United States and Canada, on the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional discrepancies between the surface data shown in the analysis and the published map may occur because of lack of space.

The 500-millibar Chart presents the 500-millibar contours and isotherms at 7:00 a.m. i.s.t. The height contours are shown at 6-pt intervals, lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown in 5°C intervals, and are shown in red.

The only legible text I can see in this image is the word "HIGH" within the wavy contour lines on the left side of the document. The rest of the text appears to be too blurry or illegible to read accurately. The image contains what seems to be a topographical or meteorological map/chart with contour lines and another smaller diagram or image to the right.

FRIDAY, MAY 2, 1969

[The rest of the text is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and faded nature of the document. The image appears to be a weather map or meteorological chart with contour lines, possibly showing atmospheric pressure or temperature patterns. There are some faint numerical annotations on the map, but they are not clearly readable.]


- page 51 -

The image appears to be a document page containing two maps or charts. The left side shows a map with curved contour lines, and the right side shows another map or chart with some text and geographical outlines. However, most of the text is too illegible to read clearly. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some degradation or fading.

SATURDAY, MAY 3, 1969

The rest of the text is too illegible to confidently transcribe. The image appears to be a weather map or meteorological chart with curved lines, contours, and various markings, but the specific details are not clear enough to read precisely.


- page 53 -

The text I can clearly read is:

AT 10,000 FT. MSL

The rest of the text is too illegible or blurry for me to confidently transcribe. The image appears to contain two maps or charts - one with curved contour lines on the left side, and what looks like a map of the United States on the right side.

Sunday May 4, 1969

The text I can clearly read is "LOW" and "HIGH" on the map/chart. The rest of the text appears to be too blurry or faint to confidently transcribe. The image appears to be a weather map or meteorological chart with contour lines, curved lines, and various markings.

MONDAY, APRIL 21, 1969

[The rest of the text on the image is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a weather map or meteorological chart with various contour lines, annotations, and markings, but the specific details are difficult to read clearly.]


- page 56 -

I apologize, but I cannot discern any legible text in this image. The page appears to contain two diagrams or charts - one on the left side with concentric curved lines, and another on the right side with what seems to be a map or geographical representation. However, the text is too blurry or faded to read.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES APR. 7-13, 1969

[The rest of the text is quite dense and technical. Here's a summary of the key text:]

The document appears to be a detailed explanation of daily weather maps, discussing how the maps are created, the symbols used, and how to interpret various meteorological data. It mentions the Surface Weather Map, 500-millibar chart, Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and Precipitation Chart. The text explains how weather data is collected, processed, and presented, including information about temperature, wind direction, and precipitation.

The document provides technical details about how these weather maps are compiled, the challenges in creating them (such as space limitations), and how to read and understand the various meteorological symbols and charts.

The text is quite technical and appears to be an instructional or explanatory document about daily weather mapping and analysis from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Environmental Data Service.

MONDAY, APRIL 7, 1969

The rest of the text on the page is illegible or appears to be part of a technical diagram or map with contour lines and various numerical annotations.


- page 60 -

The image appears to be a document with a topographical or meteorological map/chart in the upper portion of the page. The map contains contour lines and circular patterns. The rest of the page is mostly obscured by a dark, grainy overlay that makes the lower portion of the document illegible. The only text I can clearly make out is "GULF COAST" in small print near the bottom of the map section.

LOW

(Some text in bottom left corner appears to be illegible)

The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric map with contour lines, pressure systems, and annotations indicating high and low pressure areas. The map seems to cover a large geographic region with curved lines representing atmospheric patterns.


- page 62 -

The text I can clearly read is:

HIGH

The rest of the text appears to be too blurry or illegible to confidently transcribe. The image appears to be a topographical or contour map with wavy lines representing elevation or some other measurement, but the details are not crisp enough to definitively describe.


- page 63 -

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 1969

The rest of the text on the page appears to be part of a map or chart with various lines, contours, and numerical annotations, but the specific text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The document seems to be a meteorological or geographical chart of some kind.


- page 64 -

The text on this page is largely illegible. The image appears to contain two sections:

1. A left section with curved, wavy contour lines or topographical-like lines
2. A right section with some scattered markings or dots

Most of the lower portion of the page is a blurry, grayscale background with some dark edges or shadows. No clear, readable text can be discerned from this image.

FRIDAY, APRIL 11, 1969

The rest of the text is illegible or appears to be part of a weather map or meteorological chart with curved lines, contour lines, and some markings like "LOW".


- page 69 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white document with two sections:

1. A larger section on the left containing curved, wavy contour lines or topographical-like lines
2. A smaller section on the right with similar but less detailed lines and some dotted or stippled areas

The image looks like it could be a meteorological, geological, or scientific diagram, but no text is readable.


- page 70 -

SATURDAY, APRIL 12, 1969

The rest of the text on the page consists of labels like "HIGH" and "LOW" on what appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric pressure map with contour lines. The bottom of the page contains additional similar contour or pressure map sections. The text is sparse and primarily consists of these brief directional or intensity labels.
