I have seen about 5 or 6 of these things. I have seen about 5 or 6 at night. They go over very fast time or 3 or 4 time. It was a report on them. The never stopped. They appear to be round and glow with a white like a white most not like for far eye. The object was not damaged at 200 miles an hour! I suggest you the object was one kind did not.

Sincerely,
