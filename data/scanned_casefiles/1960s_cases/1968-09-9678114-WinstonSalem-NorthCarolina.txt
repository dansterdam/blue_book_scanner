Dear Sir,
I have seen what I feel was a real UFO, not just an aircraft or something else. My wife was with me and we observed it about 8:30 pm. It was stationary at first and then it began to move rapidly to the northeast. Its size was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. Its shape was elongated and the color was grey. At one point it appeared to be spinning and we could see a sort of exhaust coming from it. It was moving very fast and we lost sight of it after about 30 seconds. We were quite excited about the sighting and wish we could have observed it longer. The object was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. Sincerely,

Text from the document:

That seem to have some light there. At about 1.30 A.M. when I was awakened the light was well-situated low to the east and lit up the whole area. It first appeared very bright and then grew dimmer. It didn't seem to be moving. I thought about getting up to go out and look at it but decided to wait until daylight. After I got up and looked, it was gone. I didn't see or hear anything unusual other than this light. I am quite sure there were no aircraft or other objects in the sky at that time. The light seemed too big to be a star or planet. I cannot explain what it was or where it came from. It appeared to be about the size of a car's headlight, but much brighter. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else in this area saw the same thing.
