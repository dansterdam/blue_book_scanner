Subj: U.F.O., Sighting of

At 011212 Sept 1964, position 16-39 N, 139-59 E, while on Heading 120 degrees Magnetic, I was sitting in the Right Hand Pilot's seat leaking in the direction of 210 degrees Magnetic observing stars with the Navigator when I saw what appeared at first to be a very bright Meteor traveling in a direction from North West to South East, descending in altitude, it began to glow at the Atmospheric reentry point with a very bright bluish white light and had a pulsating red-colored tail which looked very similar to the Exhaust tail of a Jet in Afterburner. Slightly after reentry altitude, an object fell away, and although still traveling in a forward direction, fell almost straight down and burned with a Green light. It fell slowly, although much faster if it had a parachute attached. The main object seemed to burn out at 5 or 10 degrees above the horizon.

From: Air Intelligence Officer AEWRON ONE

Subj: U.F.O., sighting of

On 1 Sept 1964 at 1121Z, Position 16-39N, 139-59E, I observed what appeared to be a Rocket Reentry. Bearing 160 degrees Magnetic from our aircraft, distance unknown. Reentry was from North West toward the South East. A Green Flare was observed very shortly, Bearing 190 degrees magnetic very close to above position. Reentry vehicle made very bright white light illuminating entire area as it crossed aft of our aircraft. As it passed overhead and slightly South the steady white light gave way to a pulsating white light for a brief moment before disappearing from view, apparently burned out. At that time the green flare was noticed well to the west of the position the illuminating object fell, and bearing 190 degrees magnetic from our Aircraft. Our heading was 120 degrees magnetic, altitude 2500 feet during this time. The weather was scattered Cumulus visibility 15 miles plus.

From:  Air Intelligence Officer, AEWRON ONE

Subj:  U.F.O., Sighting of
        at 011121Z Sept 1964 in a VW-1 Aircraft on a Magnetic Heading of 120 
        degrees, I observed a sudden pale green flash, lighting up the sky out 
        the Port window of the Cockpit. I was standing between the pilot seats 
        at the time observing stars and discussing them with the Pilots. My view 
        was somewhat restricted, I leaned to the right, looked out the Starboard 
        window and observed a bright green object, brighter than a meteor, descending. 
        Object seemed to disappear at 240 degrees true azimuth from the aircraft. 
        approximate direction of fall was 240 degrees true azimuth also, time 
        actually in view was short, however, probably no more than one second.
