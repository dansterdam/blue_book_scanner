Investigation reveals that the object sighted by Mr. [redacted] was in all probability an aircraft landing at the Collier Airport located approximately 5 miles due north of the Spring Branch area. Mr. [redacted], owner of the Collier Airport, stated he had knowledge of one aircraft landing at approximately the time in question. The aircraft was a Cessna Skylane belonging to Mr. [redacted], an attorney in Houston. Mr. [redacted] stated he was on a direct flight from Houston International to Collier Airport at approximately 2000 feet. He made a normal rectangular path, landing to the north, but was required to make a rapid descent due to miscalculation of the base leg. Mr. [redacted] stated his aircraft is colored red and beige and has a rotating beacon on the tail. Mr. [redacted] stated he landed at approximately 2030 hours which is approximately one hour sooner than the reported sighting and possibly could be explained by an error made in the report or by Mr. [redacted]. No further investigation is required in my opinion.
