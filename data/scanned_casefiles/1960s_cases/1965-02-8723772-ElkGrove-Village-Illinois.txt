orange-ish tinge than reported by Mrs. Crowley. However, in the absence of her reporting the moon, and coupled with the fact that the moon was certainly in any event within a few degrees of the reported sighting, considerable doubt must be thrown on there having been a separate globe from that produced by the setting moon.

NBC wishes me to come in at the end of this documentary to discuss these sightings. It ought to be easy, since the Barrington Hills case is almost certainly a meteor, this is probably the moon, but the only puzzling case remains is that of the Elmwood Park police and this is a real puzzler. It is a "Leveland" case right in our own back yard! It is unfortunate that O'Hare did not report it officially so that it could have been investigated much sooner than it has been!

Dear Major:

Sighting, Elk Grove Village, Ill.
February 8, 1965

This is an account of the NBC "Documentary on UFO'S" treatment of the Elk Grove Village case. I was present throughout the entire interview and filming, although I did not take part in it. The witness was a well self-possessed, who is a photogenic girl of about 26 and reasonably well known locally.

Her story follows and then I'll give a few details of how the filming was done.

She was coming home by herself at about midnight, February 8, 1965 (Feb. 9). (NICAP report says 11:55 p.m.) She was coming from a doctor's appointment, a doctor who makes late appointments for people who can't come earlier. She lives on a curved street called Harmony Lane and as she was curving around toward her house, some four doors approximately north of it, she saw a glowing oval of light over her neighbor's house, more or less directly west of her. I determined the bearing to be 275-280 degrees, magnetic. She stopped her car and put out the lights and gazed at the 'object'. Although she said object, she pointed out that it was nothing more than two inter-connecting ovals of light of uniform intensity that seemed to sway back and forth. She continued toward the house in the car without turning the lights on and drove into her driveway which is in the front of the house, as it is in many suburban type homes. This temporarily blocked her view of the globe of light but she hurried over the icy sidewalk to the left of her house. The house over which she said the light was, is just fifty to seventy-five yards from her house and she was positive that the light was directly over that house. She did not seem to get the point when I asked her how she knew that it was directly over the house. It was over the house and that's all there was to it. The house is fifty feet long and she said the object was about forty feet long and was about twenty or thirty feet above the house, although whenever she drew it, she drew the light quite close to the house, almost directly over the roof.

She said she stood at the back of her house transfixed at this sight, but not at all frightened--the view was no sound--and then, instead of going directly into the house, which she could have from where she was standing, she ran around to the front of the house again, fumbled with her keys, finally got in, ran to the window, but the object was gone. She then

dashed to the bedroom to get her husband and hauled him out to look.
They both went to the window to look. At that time the object was
definitely gone.

I questioned her closely on the edges of the object and she maintained
that the ovals of light had a definite periphery and were not fuzzy.
She drew them for the cameras many times and the best description I can
give here is that they were simply two ellipses at right angles to each
other, two ellipses of rather low eccentricity.

The filming of this whole episode took from about 7:00 p.m. until
1:00 a.m. It is ridiculous the lengths to which these documentary people
will go. They will do a scene over and over again, aiming for perfec-
tion. They first had her tell her story to the cameras and the mics.
The story is much as I have given it above. She spoke also of not being
afraid of the ridicule of neighbors. She saw what she saw and there
was no point in hiding it. She said she was conscious of the fact that
her husband's position, and that of children in school, might be
jeopardized by unsavory talk, but that she felt that she must report it.
The girl herself is a highschool graduate and then had a year or two, I
believe, of interior decorating. I would judge her a positive reporter
but not a terribly good reporter. She decides on the things she is sure
of and then sticks with them.

After the filming at the dining room table, with all the lights going
full blast for fully half an hour or more, they had her draw the pictures
for the silent cameras. Then they had her change clothes and re-enact
the wintery scene of her coming in, running to the window, looking,
running to yet her husband and pulling him out of bed. (They did not
show that portion; they showed merely his running out of the bedroom
to the window in his pajamas and robe. In her desire to be extremely
accurate, the young lady remarked that her husband doesn't wear pajamas,
but the NBC people said they had to take some liberties in the name of
decency and he wore pajamas!) As you can see, it was a rather jolly
evening and I forgot to mention that two NICAP members were present,
Larsen, who is President of the Chicago chapter and another man whose
name temporarily escapes me, though I can get it. I maintained amicable
relations with them, but in no sense coming to grips with them. In
any event, they seemed a cut above the average NICAP members, or at
least did not seem so until I overheard them talking in the kitchen when
they thought I was asleep. I might as well tell that now.

Along about midnight, I was getting rather tired and since I had a nine
o'clock class the next morning, I excused myself and lay down on a couch
in the living room while the NBC cameramen went outside to film the
progress of her car down the street, etc. I did sleep some, but awoke

to hear the NICAP people sealing one of the NBC crew members and
with some real cock-and-bull stories. They didn't
know that I was listening. Along with the usual vilification of the
Air Force and their secrecy, they were tossing around some real oddball
stories about friends of theirs wandering gone to the basement of the
Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and wandering into a forbidden
region where they found "little green men", or at least models of them.
They were shooed out of this "restricted" area. Then the NICAP man went
on to say that "Did you know that during the war, the basement of the
Museum of Science and Industry was the center of the security operations
of the U.S.?" If those were not his exact words, that was certainly the
sense of it, namely, that the basement of the museum was a super-secret
"hideout". The NICAP members showed out in their usual uncritical
form! Both these men, however, are basically likeable chaps and certainly fair and honest, according to their lights.

We finally got away from there at 1:30 a.m. and the next day, in
thinking this over, I came upon what is probably the solution.

I asked the girl where the moon was and she stated that she did not see
the moon, but that the sky was very clear. She said she knew it wasn't
the moon because it was too bright and too big and that it wasn't Venus
for the same reason. It wasn't the great white owl, which some neighbors
said it might have been, because owls move, and this didn't. She said
there were no clouds, but we should check meteorological conditions on
that day. Both this case and the Elmwood Park case will cause a great
deal of comment since they will be aired before approximately a million
people. And the documentary is quite good, have no question on that.

Reference to the nautical almanac for February 8 (She first said
February 15, which would have thrown this whole case out of court), but
it now has been established that she went to the doctor on February 8,
The moon was exactly at first quarter (and thus a very fine half oval)
and it set in the Chicago region at 12:24 a.m. It's declination was
plus 13 degrees, which would have placed the half moon with the rounded
side largely pointing downward at about five or six degrees above the
western horizon and slightly to the north of west. Refraction and
especially the presence of a thin cirrus cloud bank could have given
the impression of an interesting, civil sighting over the neighbor's
house. The directions check out exactly. The sighting bearing was
275-230 and elevation was 100 ± 3. This was almost exactly the position
of the moon at that time. The fact that she should have reported the
moon and this globe makes it likely that she saw the setting moon.
There is no question from her general demeanor that she is excitable,
and most people are not aware of how the moon looks at exactly first
quarter when it is setting on the western horizon. It looks at least
twice as large as it normally does but generally has a deeper yellow or
