Green Flash
Over Cincinnati

On May 3, 1962, at 3 p.m. a bright greenish-white flash spread over the Cincinnati sky. Reports generated by Cincinnati sky watchers for three to five seconds agreed its light was visible for three to 10 seconds. that the object or light was luminous, fast and traveled burtantly toward the southwest. The object was described by witnesses as "rocket-shaped," a "soft blue puff," "haze in color," and "a sort of streak." A hug of fire with a tail, sort of greenish.

No particular shape was at a elevation of 30 degrees in the south, traveling from southeast to southwest. Although the object was explained as a possible "meteor," the Cincinnati Explorer noted that no one had a satisfactory explanation at the time of the sighting.

Reporters at Columbus and Dayton, Ohio airports also received reports.

HQ CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCE: FLYING SAUCER REVIEW

9 May 62
Newcastle, England

Another convert

The Newcastle Journal on May 13 reported here a "disbeliever in flying saucers was converted in evidence that he could no longer ignore. The account read as follows:

"Until yesterday, Mr. John did not believe in flying saucers. His doubts began in the small hours of yesterday morning when he was getting ready for bed at his home in Denshaw Carlow, near Newcastle.

Mr. Carr, a 35-year-old salesman living at Westhorpe and a large house near which appeared to come close and then swing away. Thinking he was seeing things, he roused his brother. 16-years-old.

Mr. Carr told the Journal-Gains reporter, too, and said, 'I don't know what it was. I don't believe in flying saucers and I'm prepared to accept any sober explanation for it. But here is forthcoming.'

'When I tell people of what I have seen they begin to tell me another story. My mother and brother also saw it and they make their minds up. He said he could not have been mistaken because of the very nature of the occurrence.'

'I watched, then slept - I don't want people to think I'm cranky. I would like to know what it was. I have reduced these stories of my saucers in the past. Now, well, I just don't know.'"

TOKUSHIMA-KEN, JAPAN-May 10,1962.-A 20-yr
old farmer saw three unidentified flying objects
which approached at a speed less than or-
dinary aircraft. Speed from 55 to 100 mph. They
were crescent-shaped and glowing. A very
brilliant orange. The objects were about
the size of a dodgeball. No sound or trail.
Duration 3 min. (Note similarity to recent
Hawaiian sighting.)

                                                        Lexington, Massachusetts

Previously a May 13, 1962 report of four similar looking objects, looking like aluminum-colored round-topped circular sources, were seen and reported to be, as they moved slowly north near a transport plane leaving Hanscom Air Force Base. In all three of these New England sightings the mystery objects were seen under good weather conditions and showed good clear edges. The description (parachute-shaped) in almost a half-dozen sightings near the vicinity of Hanscom Air Force Base was repeated time and time again.

Upon contacting Hanscom Field authorities there stated that there had been no sightings of 'flying saucers' or UFOs over or near Hanscom in recent weeks.

Either the eyewitnesses didn't report their sightings to the Air Force for fear of ridicule or censorship orders, or Hanscom Air Force officials were unable to see these objects reported by so many other people, which is highly doubtful.

May 12 - Boston Patent Lawyer Robert K. Randall reported four parachute shaped, aluminum-colored, round objects near a transport plane leaving Hanscom Field near Lexington, Mass.
