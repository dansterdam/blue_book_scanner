Green flash over Cincinnati
On 3 May 1963, at 8:55 p.m., a bright green flash streaked across the Cincinnati sky. Several witnesses reported seeing the light which traveled from north to south in a matter of seconds. The light was described as a "bluegreen puff" hues in color.
The report mentions that the Cincinnati Engineer-Astronomer had a meeting scheduled at the time of the sighting, but was unable to observe the event. Reports also came from Whitelaw, Kentucky.
The document provides details about the green flash sighting over Cincinnati.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW

- Another convert - 

The Newcastle Journal and Associated Newspapers, England 
On May 9 the Newcastle Journal published an interesting article about the sighting of a flying saucer by a former RAF pilot. 
The account read:
Mr. John went out one evening, as he often does, to have a look at the skies over Hexenville, England. He uses a telescope for this purpose. At around 8 p.m. he caught sight of a shining object approaching from the south. It was cigar-shaped and silvery in color. 
After watching it for a time, he was convinced that it was not an aircraft. It seemed to be suspended in the air, not moving. He watched it for about ten minutes, then it suddenly shot off at a tremendous speed, disappearing from sight in just a few seconds.
Mr. John, a former RAF pilot, says he is now a firm believer in flying saucers. Although he is normally a very skeptical person, this experience has convinced him that such objects do exist. 
He says: "I have never seen anything like it before. I am quite sure it was not an aircraft of any kind. The thing was hovering motionless in the air for several minutes, then it just took off at an incredible speed. I would not have believed it if I had not seen it with my own eyes."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text description of a UFO sighting. The text describes the following:

TOKUSHIMA-KEN, JAPAN, MAY 20, 1962
An observer saw three orange, glowing objects which approached and then receded at high speed. The objects were well-defined, saucer-shaped and glowing with a very brilliant orange. The objects appeared to be about 20-25 yards in diameter and of the same brightness for the duration of 3-4 min. (Note similarity to recent Fireball sighting).

No Case (Information Only)

Previously 12 May 1962 report of four similar looking objects in the sky between 4:20-4:55 PM near a transport plane leaving Hanscom Air Force Base. In all three of these July 1962 sightings, no recognizable circular or disc-shaped objects were seen under good weather conditions and good clear edge outlines - no haziness or lights. In this report, Hanscom Field authorities there stated that there were unconfirmed reports of a previous sighting in that same area of UFOS over or near Hanscom in recent weeks. The Director of Personnel and Training, who is highly doubtful, did not report his sightings to the Air Force until the 12 May incident occurred.
May 13--Boston Patent Lawyer Robert K. Biddell reported four saucer-shaped objects maneuvering near a transport plane leaving Hanscom Field near Lexington, Mass.
