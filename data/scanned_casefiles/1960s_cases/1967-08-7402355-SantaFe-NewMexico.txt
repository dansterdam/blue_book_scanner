PROJECT 10173 RECORD

1. [Field is mostly illegible]
2. LOCATION: Santa Fe, New Mexico
3. SOURCE: [Illegible]
10. CONCLUSION: Possible (PSYCHOLOGICAL)
Case: Air Bell or Break in Emission

4. N.: [Illegible]
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: SE to NE
8. PHOTOS: XX Yes, No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes, No

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer sighted a spherical, whitish-gray, semi-transparent object that appeared to be not more than 1,000 ft. away in about 1 m. SE way.

COMMENTS: Initially the observer refused to give any information on his sighting, unless he was given a personal interview. He stated: "I feel I am on to something big..." He then elaborates that he was sort of in a nervous state during the conversation about this matter (location, schedules, type, etc.)

In the observational time he was a "sit cat" and could not take a photo almost exactly. Yet the object was set to be either a crack or an air bell in the emission.

The picture was snapped in desperation. I did not know that I had successfully captured the object until I went over the pictures again - and noticed the "on picture". Some of the dates are somewhat inaccurate - but are within a day or two of being correct.

I'm enclosing negative - (about negative). Can't determine if it is a film negative or not. Both so many pictures - if all sorts. Let me help.

Sincerely,

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order Number 67-131 submitted by Major Quintanilla (TDSIR), requesting that photo analysis be accomplished on the submitted slide (negative) and photograph to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: A close examination of the emulsion side of the negative revealed either a "break" or "ball" in the emulsion. Either of the two flaws could have been created by gas exiting from the emulsion during the drying process when the film was manufactured or developed. These types of flaws in the emulsion are not uncommon.

Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17603

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of August 8, 1967 at Santa Fe, New Mexico. Photo analysis was accomplished by photographic experts at Wright Patterson AFB with the following results:

A close examination of the emulsion side of the negative revealed either a "break" or an "air bell" in the emulsion. Either of the two flaws could have been created by gas emitting from the emulsion during the drying process when the film was manufactured or developed. These types of flaws in the emulsion of film are not uncommon.

Loma, PA

Dear Sir,

I have written several letters to you - only to lay them up expectantly. It is still with hesitance that I begin to write. There are too many things in this business. But then how much should I tell - and to what?

That you are not a complete fool and you are playing this at its true worth, I feel I am at something big - something far better as regards flying saucers. If you might buy flying saucers - I should be confirmed. But then I see a doubt that we are many more than to form some new "interest" in this business.

Enough now.


- page 22 -

I have information on "locating" "arrival", and otherwise on the so-called "UFO".

I have a negative, and print and a blow-up (8"x10"). I will not surrender negative to any one anywhere less if placing security documented safeguards as long as I am able. It is preserved and shielded. It occurs if you are interested in this photo of a flying saucer taken far, far from Lancaster, I will show it to you.

I will not mail it to anyone.

Our information you will gladly decide I will give you only what I decide. This entry, but if you are interested - confirmation along this mutually (location schedule - type etc.) would of necessity have it fill a "test for that" soft - most game.

Lancaster, Pa.

Dear Sir:

I wrote a letter to you a few days ago. I received no reply. As a matter of fact I wasn't expecting one.

The information you and add'l confirmation needed was deliberately scant on my part. I don't blame you if you get little from your C.P. "tech" file - if it was yet that far.

Forwarding you a small color photo - if you send things, the left side of the photo - you will see a small sphere light effect in the sky.

Since I don't wish to say too much more about what I can only say that I have a wealth of inside information on UFO, actually I just had "Holloway" make of this

more helpful to you - here I'm at to

But all I hope that you could give
me one more photo and give of this
picture - and return it to me - or
at least acknowledge receipt of this
letter.

So much to consider, I could give
you what I think is useful information
if you care to send some one - to
tell with me. I'm doing Lancaster,
sometimes in October, so if you want
to contact me - try of the at no
