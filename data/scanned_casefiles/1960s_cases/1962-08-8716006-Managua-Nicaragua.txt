At 131540Z August an unidentified flying object was observed
over Managua by ARMA. Passing from northwest to southeast,
object first appeared in distance as a falling star. Moving
rapidly at undetermined speed, without noise, at low but
undetermined altitude, object appeared to follow horizontal
course. When overhead, body unidentifiable but appeared as
glow with luminous trail which appeared to be chemical pro-
pellant. Object not identified by local qualified sources.
Seen by other unqualified observers results local rumor that
object was Soviet astronauts and probably was reported as
such to international press. SCP-3. Signed Morgan.
