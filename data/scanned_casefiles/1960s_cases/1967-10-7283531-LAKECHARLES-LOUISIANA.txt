10. CONCLUSION: HOT AIR BALLOON (Possible)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The wind was blowing from 130 degrees at 5 knots. There were numerous sighting at the local levels of hot air balloons during the late summer months in the southern U.S. It seems possible that the object was a hot air balloon with a fire sufficiently attached so as to explode after the candles had burned.

Observer, observed a fiery object that was under the clouds. Thought that it might not be a plane or fire. The object exploded and fell toward the earth.

Saturday morning,
October 21, 1967
Boulevard Baptist Church

At approximately 6:15 this morning, Saturday, October 21, 1967, I saw two large fiery objects travelling through the sky in a northerly direction from here. The objects were to the north of here....however their direction of travel was east to west--possibly south east to northwest...

Flying, one slightly behind the other in what would seem to be a formation relationship, they resembled a large tadpole shaped object.... fiery head with a fiery tail... large toward the head and diminishing symmetrically toward the tail tip. The objects travelled in what seemed to be a straight course. They were visible for only a very brief period.

Their speed was exceedingly great...much like a meteor or meteorite. The difference was in the course of travel. These objects maintained the same apparent horizontal course so long as they were in sight. There was no sound connected with these objects. They disappeared into the darkness of that seemed to be the same line of travel as their appearance and flight across the area.

I called the Office of Sheriff Henry A. Reid, Jr. and reported the sighting. The deputy answering the call told me to come and told me that the city police had heard the call from across the river.
