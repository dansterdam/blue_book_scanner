Dear Sirs:

A few months ago I filled out a UFO report to my city. Since that time I have told place on Friday, Sept. 23, 1965 at about 8:00 P.M. near the town of Landis, N.C. to Project Bluebook explaining what we sighted.

Thank you,

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

I reported to you an elevation of 3 UFO's - that I saw on Sept. 22, 1965. I wrote to you a few weeks ago asking for your explanation. I received your explanation on August 17. The aircraft involved in air refueling, etc. etc. I am no pilot and I am not (fogged), etc. your phony story.

Off what I saw were aircraft, then I must say that aircraft certainly have changed a lot. I would have to be a patient in a mental hospital to believe your notorious story!

Sincerely,
