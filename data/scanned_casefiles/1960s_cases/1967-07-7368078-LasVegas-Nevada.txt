26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The object was described as being difficult to identify visually due to its extremely high speed. The witness estimated it was traveling at about 3,235 mph and was approximately 12-15 miles away. The witness was located outdoors and was not moving at the time of the observation. Various optical aids were used to try to observe the object, including eyeglasses, binoculars, and sky cameras, but the object's speed made it difficult to get a clear visual impression. The witness struggled to describe an everyday object that would have a similar appearance to the high-speed object observed.
