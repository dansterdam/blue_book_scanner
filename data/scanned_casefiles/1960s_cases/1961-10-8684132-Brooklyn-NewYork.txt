Gentlemen,

the date on the sheet says Oct. 1. I will explain. As how I first saw the somewhat quickly scribbled down some of the backs which are in the sheet, when I got home, I made it out as soon as possible, but I didn't know where send it now. But finally, I bound the address of Atic. I hope my report has enough information, if not, write to me and tell me what you wish to know, if possible, I'll answer it.

Thanking you for your courteous attention,
I am,

[Note: The location "Brooklyn, N.Y." is written in the top right corner of the document]
