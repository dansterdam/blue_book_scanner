UNIDENTIFIED IN A/C EVALUATION

FTD Form 164 forwarded to witness, however, not received. Observation date distant with respect to reporting date. Investigating officer unable to confirm additional points.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
On 1 Apr 66, at 1900 hrs, witness observed a bright white light in the northwest which appeared to be stationary; still to move for about a min. Then it moved slowly to the northeast, decreasing the elev to about 70 deg. There was a bright white, then blinking light in the center, a red light in the moon, and blue light in the rear.
The obj was somewhat smaller than the full moon.

Nothing more that could be learned; couldn't have been a conventional report. However, additional info is needed to confirm and point up.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some words are difficult to read clearly, so I've transcribed as accurately as possible]

[Top of page has several blank/partially legible header fields]

[First paragraph appears to discuss some event or observation, but several words are difficult to discern]

[Subsequent paragraphs contain references to locations like "Center Hill" and what seem to be details about an incident, but the text is quite faded and challenging to read completely]

[Bottom of page seems to have some additional notes or commentary, but again, significant portions are illegible]

Due to the poor image quality and faded typewriting, I cannot confidently reproduce the entire text verbatim. Large sections of the document are difficult to read with certainty.


- page 4 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Header fields are mostly blank/illegible]

[First paragraph is mostly illegible, with only fragments of words visible]

"... very secret about"

"... slight approximately"

"... sect of flying - glided near &
... like an airplane pattons."

"... began lines that were ground"

"... was slight darker than it
first might"

[Bottom of document shows:]
"... documented &
... L Back on the flight
... documented here
Catskill, N.Y.
12414"

Some text is illegible or partially obscured, so I have noted where I could not fully read the text.
