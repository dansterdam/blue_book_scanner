AFO DI-482x                                                                     28 NOV 1960

Congressional Request for Summary of UFO Sightings
(in Robert Smart, House Armed Services Committee)

SAFO-3d (L/Col Tacker)

1. The summaries contained in this correspondence are of the UFO sightings which occurred in the Red Bluff, California area between 12-20 August 1960. These summaries and the associated ATC analysis are forwarded per telephone requests by L/Col Tacker, SAFO-3d and L/Col J. Boland, SAFO. On 16 November 1960, information concerning these sightings was requested from SAFO by Mr Robert Smart, House Armed Services Committee.

2. On 13 August 1960 at 2315 hours PST, two California highway patrolmen observed an unidentified flying object while patrolling 13 miles south of Red Bluff, California. The two officers stated that the object suddenly appeared directly in front of their patrol car and their first impression was that it was an aircraft about to crash. Into officers leaped from their car in order to be in a better position to act after the expected crash. With outside of their car but of course were immediately struck by the absence of sound, but assumed the aircraft was without power.

As was their approach, with no CO-3 or back of hand visual it gradually reversed itself, and at high speed gained approximately 500 feet of altitude, where it came to a complete stop. Two of officers described the object as surrounded by a glow, and at each end or the round or elliptical object there were red lights. At times there were approximately five white lights visible between two red lights. Officer Scott's impression was that the object was sweeping the area with red beam and industrial intake lights. He further stated that it appeared to take positive action to avoid his staring, the red light at the patrol vehicle upon it. Both officers described the motion as abrupt, but generally toward the east and reported that they followed and watched the object, it was approached by a similar object. Finally both objects disappeared below the eastern horizon. Upon return to the Tehama County Sheriff's Office, it was determined that two deputies and the night jailer had also experienced seeing the object and their impressions were the same as the two patrolmen.

3. On 17 August 1960, at 1930 hours PST, Mr [redacted] of Red Bluff, California was driving up Jolla Hill Road with his wife and son toward what is commonly called Hog Back Road. An object reported that he and his family sighted a bright metal-like object, approximately true 120 level which was flying in a northerly direction. [redacted] stated that the object was approximately three to

Here is the text from the document:

four miles away and the first impression was that it was a large helicopter. When it and his family reached the spot where they thought the object to be, tiny sighted it approximately one-half mile away and approximately 100 feet below them. The object appeared to immediately pick up speed, rising out of the canyon and passing over the road in front of the family. It dropped from sight for a few moments and then seen traveling up a branch canyon. The object was described as completely round and approximately 35 to 50 feet in diameter. When it rose from the canyon and passed over the road, it appeared to have a light near the nose. The light had a reddish purple hue. The object was reported to have a second light which was located on the back. The second light appeared as a narrow bluish band. The object was estimated to have a speed of 25-30 miles per hour.

4. On 17 August 1960 at approximately 2100 hours local, Dept of Correction, NRS Forest-look-out, and site sighted an unidentified flying object from the Forestry look-out at Inskim Mountain. The object was described as a dull red light above the horizon. The object was reported to have faded and reappeared several times. An ground check was made but no recall to be generally stationary. At approximately 2130 hours another object was sighted which was similar to the first; however, it appeared to be moving from right to left at a constant elevation.

5. As evidenced by exhibits I and H of attachment #1 to this document, there were many sightings of UFO's in the California area between 12-20 August 1960. These exhibits also confirm two fact that circumstances surrounding these sightings were generally the same.

6. This case was brought to the attention of AFIC on 16 August 1960 by a telephone call from L/Col I. Jacks, SAFJB-34, on this date. (Atch #2) was sent to "California AFB, California requesting a full and detailed investigation in accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2, dated 11 September 1957.

7. On 16 August 1960, AFIC made telephone contact with the 359th Radar Squadron (SAGE) (AVC), Red Bluff Air Station, Red Bluff, California. The 359th is then 12th Tactical Air Control Squadron, Adair Air Force Base. Major Leroy of the Radar station reported that nothing had happened on their scopes which could be interpreted as a sighting between 12-16 August 1960. Contact was again established with the 359th on 17 August 1960, and was informed by Major Daniel Hanlon, Air Interceptor Patrolman, that an unidentified object was on the scope of his unit on the night of the sighting. This Radar Unit at Red Bluff is a SAGE station. The equipment at Red Bluff is only monitored at that station and is tied in to the Portland Air Defense Sector, which has the identification and intercept responsibility. Major Leroy informed the California Highway Patrol that its station had no capability for identification, but that in view of the fact that no recordable had occurred, no unidentified object was on the scope.

The major stated that the officers were not convinced that his information was all true.

8. For further support of the data collected during the investigation of this case ATIC obtained from the Air Weather Service (AWS) at Asheville, North Carolina the MAN Forms 31 (adiabatic charts) for the Red Bluff, California area covering the period 3-24 August 1960. The weather stations at Red Bluff, Chico, and Redding, California are second order stations. Thus second order stations serve on a limited schedule, generally daylight hours, and do not complete adiabatic charts. The most representative records available for determining the vertical temperature gradient for Red Bluff are the Adiabatic Charts from Oakland, California and Medford, Oregon. At Red Bluff, almost exactly half way between these two cities, 165 miles from Oakland and 155 miles from Medford. Since the general weather map and surface chart was safe to assume that interpolation will give a representative picture of the vertical temperature gradient at Red Bluff. The Adiabatic Charts indicate that a strong temperature inversion was prevalent in the entire northern California area during the period of the sighting.

9. The conclusion of ATIC is that the sightings which occurred in the Red Bluff area were due to atmospheric refraction. It is an impossible task to determine what the exact light source was for each specific incident, but the planet Mars was the most probable culprit in the instance of the highway patrol. In the plane of the light of the sighting was just below the horizon and probably move into view due to the refraction of its light by the atmosphere. A contributing factor to the sighting could have been the layer of smoke which hung over the area in a thin stratiform layer. This smoke came from the forest fires in the area and may in a layer due to the stable conditions associated with the inversion.

10. The usual occurrence in nature is for the temperature of the atmosphere to decrease as altitude increases. This change in temperature with altitude is known as the "lapse rate". In some cases, however, instead of decreasing with altitude, the temperature actually increases and the condition is termed an "inversion".

11. In passing from one medium to another of different densities or different densities of the same medium, waves of radiant energy are refracted or bent from their original straight line course, except when entering at 90° to the surface separating the two media. The bending, is explained by the fact that the waves travel at different speeds in media of different densities. This, in effect, means that a person can in fact look around a corner. We are even when waves are an infinite number of layers of slightly different densities next to each other, as in the atmosphere. The fact that light is bent at different wave lengths (colors) and at different angles, unite to light is separated into color bands (spectrum) ranging; usually from red to violet. The longer wave lengths (red) being bent less than the short (blue). This secondary effect of refraction is called dispersion.

12. In addition to the usual results of atmospheric refraction, special optical effects known as mirages may occur when there are strong temperature contrasts in an adjacent layer of air. Mirages fall into two general categories termed "inferior" and "superior." The most common mirage is the inferior type, occurring when the temperature profile is following the normal pattern of decreasing with altitude. However, for the condition to occur, a layer extremely warm, air must exist near the surface with relatively cooler air, therefore, denser air above it. Convection would normally occur under these conditions, but usually has not begun due to lack of turbulence and the slow transfer of heat. The eye tends to conduction and radiation. These conditions cause the light which reaches the eye to be less curved than normally, and in some extreme conditions to actually be curved in the opposite direction. The effect of inferior mirages is to shorten the distance to objects apparent horizon (see Atch #3). In this type of mirage a distant object is sometimes seen inverted and below the real object. This is the type of mirage which is so familiar to persons on deserts. The water they see being an inverted image of the sky. An everyday experience with a mirage of this type is the water appearing to be dry highway. The hot spot remaining some distance ahead of the car. These mirages are called "inferior" because the image is below the real object, when the opposite temperature conditions occur, a cold layer of air with warmer air on top (inversion), the conditions produce a superior mirage. These mirages tend to increase the distance to our horizon and their effects are much more startling than inferior mirages. When these conditions occur a person can actually see objects which normally would be below his horizon. Sometimes the images will be highly magnified or extremely distorted. This mirage is called a superior mirage. Because the image occurs above the actual object. In this explanation reference has been made to layers of air, but it should be understood that the transition from one layer to the next is not abrupt, there is mixing and a gradual change in the refractive power of the air, and the effects of mirages are due to this continuous variation.

13. A number of the witnesses mentioned that the object they observed was moving, appeared somewhat speed. The speed, most commonly mentioned was centered around 35 miles per hour. It should be noted that these witnesses were riding in cars and that this is probably the speed at which they were driving. It is a common characteristic of mirages that the image remains a constant distance from the observer in order that the geometry associated with the phenomena remains fairly consistent. Mirages of water holes seen in the desert are curiously consistent. Rates of speed were reached by the fact that the object appeared to keep with their cars.

14. It is quite probable that reports of all of the sightings which occurred in California during the period 12-20 August 1960 did not reach ATIC. It is, therefore, impossible to make an accurate estimate as to how many sightings actually occurred and what percentage were


- page 9 -

due to ta inversion. It is possible that some were due to other
causes such as "hysterial" and the "jet into a cold altitude of
some people. However, in view of all available evidence in this
case, it is concluded that the effects associated with the inversion
were responsible for the sightings which occurred in the Red Bluff
California area between 12-20 August 1960.
