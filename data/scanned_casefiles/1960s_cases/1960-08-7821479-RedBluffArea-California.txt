SUMMARY: On 15 Aug 50, a disc-shaped object was observed by numerous witnesses in the Red Bluff, California area. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes and several observers reported the object was accompanied by two smaller objects. One witness reported that the object discharged two smaller objects which then returned to the main object. The object was bright white in color and appeared to hover, climb, descend, and perform other maneuvers. All witnesses interviewed, including sheriff's department personnel, described the object and its actions in a similar manner.

ALLEGED SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
NEAR RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA, 7 AUGUST 1960

 CONTENTS: This report was prepared by the Office of Special Investigations, 25th Air Division, Travis Air Force Base, California, at the request of the District Commander, 25th Air Division.

 The object observed was described as round or disc-shaped, bright orange in color, and appearing to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter. It was observed by two highway patrolmen of the California Highway Patrol and an employee of the California Division of Forestry.

 The object was first observed at approximately 2000 hours, 7 August 1960, about 10 miles north of Red Bluff, California, on U.S. Highway 99 West. It was in sight for about 10 to 15 minutes, during which time it hovered, maneuvered, accelerated, and descended to a point estimated to be about 500 feet above the ground before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

 The report contains details of the sighting, statements of the witnesses, and comments of the investigating officers. Efforts to develop additional information are continuing.

This report is a tape recording of the witness's account of the incident of 6 Aug 60 which he observed in the Red Bluff area, California.  He related that at approximately 2300 local time on the above date, he was in his automobile on Highway 99E, north of Red Bluff, and he observed two bright lighted objects in the sky which were in a vertical position to the ground.  These objects remained motionless in the sky for about 10-15 minutes, then one of the objects suddenly descended straight down and the other object remained hovering in the sky for a few more minutes, then it too descended straight down.  After this incident, no further observation of the objects was made.

Congressional Request for Summary of UFO Sightings
(Dr. Robert Smart, House Armed Services Committee)

ABOUT-3d (1/Col Hacker)
1. The incidents contained in this correspondence are of the UFO sightings which occurred in the Red Bluff, California area between 23-24 August 1960. These sightings were reported to the USAF (Major L. F. Hagar, AFOC-3d) and (LI/Col J. Roland, CAFLI) on 16 November 1960. Information concerning this sighting was furnished by Mr. Robert Smart, Phone.

2. On 13 August 1960, at 2345 hours, PDT, two California highway patrol-men observed an unidentified flying object while patrolling 15 miles south of Red Bluff, California. The object appeared to be round and emitted a pulsating light. When first observed, the object was approximately three miles from the patrol car and the witnesses estimated the diameter to be about 60 feet. As the object approached the patrol car, the officers leaped from their car in order to better observe it. The object hovered at an altitude of about 500 feet and remained in their vicinity for about 10 to 15 minutes. The object then accelerated rapidly and was lost to sight in a few seconds. The witnesses stated that the object displayed no power exhaust or sound.

3. On 17 August 1960, at 1230 hours, PDT, a deputy sheriff and a deputy sheriff trainee, Tehama County Sheriff's Office, it was determined that two deputies and their trainee were driving in a patrol car approximately 20 miles south of Red Bluff, California. They observed an object at ground level along the side of the highway which was approximately three to five feet in diameter and appeared to be metallic in color. As the patrol car approached, the object rose rapidly and disappeared over the horizon in approximately three to five seconds. The witnesses stated that the object made no sound and displayed no exhaust or power source.

Four miles away and the first impression was that it was a large helicopter. When the object was sighted, they thought the object to be, they sighted it approximately one-half the size and approximately the same color as the object. The Object appeared to be stationary. It dropped from sight for a few seconds and then reappeared, moving across the road in front of the family. It dropped from sight for a few more seconds and then reappeared. It seemed to be hovering over the area for several minutes. When it arose from the canyon and passed over the road it appeared to have a slight red light around it. The light gave an illusion of a slight spinning motion. The second light appeared as a narrow whitish band. The object was estimated to be 25-30 miles per hour.

On 17 August 1960 at approximately 2100 hours local, near Stockton, California, a National Guard C-97 cargo aircraft was flying at approximately 21,000 feet and the pilot spotted a bright light at about the look-out at Inyokpn Mountain. The object was described as a full red light about the size of a bowling ball and seemed to drop a little bit, then it seemed to go back up a little bit. The object was stationary. At approximately 2130 hours another object was sighted which was similar to the first one. This object was sighted moving from right to left at a constant elevation.

This case was brought to the attention of ATC on 16 August 1960 by a telephone call from Lt./Col, N/C (Catch#2) to Oakland Air Force Control requesting a full and detailed investigation in accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2.

On 15 August 1960, ATC made telephone contact with the 925th Radar Squadron (SAGE) Red Bluff AFS, California. The 925th is tied in with the Portland Air Defense Sector. Major Air Force official informed Lt/Col N/C that case information had been forwarded to the proper authorities investigating the sighting.

On 17 September 1960 and again on 24 October 1960, Contact was again established with the 925th on the status of this case. No further information was received other than that the reported object was on the scope of his unit on the night of the sighting. The Radar Unit at Beale Air Force Base was unable to detect any object on the scope as described by the witness.

This concludes the information in this document.

The text in the document is as follows:

The major stated that the officers were not convinced that his information was all true.
6. For further support of the data collected during the investigation of this case, the Air Force 31st (Satellite Safety) at Redville, North Carolina was asked for the Air Force 31 (Satellite charts) for the Red Bluff, California area. The satellite charts indicate, according to Weather Order Stations, there were no order stations on a limited schedule, generally cloudy conditions and A/C operations during the period in question. These negations tend to substantiate the temperature gradient for Red Bluff are the Atlantic Charts from Oakland.
7. The conclusion of ATC is that the sightings which occurred in the Red Bluff area on due to a meteorological phenomenon. It is an impossible task to determine what the exact light source was for each specific sighting. The lights were light from the moon, passing aircraft, or possibly from the ground. It is obvious that the altitude of the sighting was just below the horizon and probably have into view the meteorological phenomena. The temperature gradient over the area in a north direction was a factor in the phenomenon.
10. The usual occurrence in nature is for the temperature of the atmosphere to decrease with altitude. This change in temperature with altitude is known as the "lapse rate." In some cases, however, this lapse rate can be inverted, resulting in an increase of temperature with altitude. This change in temperature gradient is called an inversion.
11. In passing from one medium to another, or of different densities or refractive indices, light is bent or refracted from its original straight line course, except when the medium changes gradually and uniformly. The resulting phenomena forms a mirage. The mirage appears to be a reflection or bent rays of different densities. This, in effect, means that a person can see when there are none or a person cannot see when there are.

12. In addition to the usual results of atmospheric refraction, special optical effects in connection with objects may occur under the conditions outlined. The most important effects are entered into the general categories termed "inferior" and "superior." The "inferior" mirage, as commonly known, is one well-recognized type which may occur under proper meteorological conditions. Such cases have not been reported in this instance since the condition to occur, a layer of extremely warm air must exist near the object where no atmospheric turbulence exists. The lower layer of air is colder and less dense, not because it was cooled from below by contact with earth or vegetation, but usually because it was hot from solar radiation and the slow transfer of heat due to convection. When the light rays pass from the cold air into the warm layer, they are bent downward and the object appears to be elevated. The conditions to actually be curved in the opposite direction. The effect is to show an inverted image of the object in the sky. This is the type of mirage which is familiar to most persons and has been mistaken for unidentified flying objects in the past.

13. A number of the witnesses mentioned that the object they observed was approximately twice the size of the sun and appeared to be accompanied by smaller objects. It should be noted that under the conditions to cause the type of mirage described, a very small distant object like the sun can appear greatly enlarged with smaller objects also magnified around it. Characteristic of this type of mirage is the fact that the mirage remains stationary as the object being viewed is moving. This is the reason that the image of the object remains essentially constant in appearance despite the movement of the observer and the changes in its actual position.

14. It is quite probable that reports of all or a majority of the sightings which occurred in California during the period 12-20 August 1960 could be explained by atmospheric refraction effects which were occurring at that time.

P-2 due to the inversion. It is possible that some were due to other causes such as "photographic equipment" or mere hoaxes by some people. However, in view of all available evidence in this case, it is concluded that the sightings were not due to anything conventional or known causes but rather appear to represent unusual phenomena observed in the Red Bluff, California area between 12-20 August 1960.
