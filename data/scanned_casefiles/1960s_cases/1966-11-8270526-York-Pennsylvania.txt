34. Does you completed this questionnaire:

26 December 1966
Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or is necessary explanation of your sighting:

Several years ago I seen or noticed what appeared to be a round object hovering about 100 to 150 feet above the ground, did not make a sound and could not rotate it could not rotate it over, or any kind of it, and the object was perfectly round and white and looked like it was made of metal. I was alone at the time and there was no one else there to see it. This was about 11 PM at night and everything was dark all around, and this object just hovered there silently for about 5 minutes and then just took off like a shot and was gone in a matter of seconds. I could not figure out what it was or where it came from.

The image appears to contain a form or questionnaire related to a UFO report. There is a hand-drawn sketch of what seems to be an unidentified flying object. The text in the document has been transcribed as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
I would say it did not disappear but faded out of sight. It appeared to be going back in the direction it had come from.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what went behind it.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / NO / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it went in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: If I heard any sound at all that I heard
b. Color: I would say it was a very bright light and appeared to have maintained much the same color during the whole observation.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the width of the match. If you had performed this simple experiment at the time, what portion of the known object would the object have covered?
About 1/2 match

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
