Here is the text from the document:

one for this month. Two weeks earlier, at the time of new moon, that body will come between the earth and the sun, producing a partial solar eclipse. To see it, you will have to be in southern Africa, along the coast of Natal in the South Atlantic or Antarctica. Over that general area, the moon will partially hide the sun.

Along a belt that is mostly over the ocean there will be what is called an annular eclipse of the sun, during which a ring of the sun's surface will be visible. This happens because the moon will then be at about its greatest distance from the earth and its size, as we see it in the sky, will not be enough to cover the solar disc.

A total eclipse of the moon will occur when it completely and the sun's outer envelope, the corona, flashes into view.

Dear Sir:

About five years ago I saw an object in the sky. The night was very quiet until I heard a humming sound. I looked up and around until I saw a blue-white light. It looked as if it was coming right at me. At that one end now being a chicken all I could think of was to hide. There were some buses near me so I got behind them. I pulled my bike over to protect me.

When I looked up again it was bright R.P. It seemed to be very large and at a low level. It stayed in one place. I'm a white and tanned colored chickening. Finally it went behind a house (the house was so close to me that it seemed to go behind it). A dog barked and I ran home. I told my family but they told me that it was just me.

Most people would forget something like this but I haven't. And I would like to know if there has ever been such a sighting. I would like to have an answer wherever you may have time.

I almost forgot to tell you that there is an Air Force Base close by and General Dynamics. Within the same area there is well helicopter.

I don't believe it was a helicopter because of the lights and the sounds. A helicopter has a whipping sound to it and the object had a humming one.

Twelve silvery "white metal" flying saucers like the "sputnik," trailing a white substance which crumbled before it could be preserved, were sighted flying at about 10,000 ft. 75 miles west of Meekatharra yesterday.

Shearers on Mt. Hale station said the objects appeared to be travelling in pairs.

They were able to keep the pairs of objects in sight for about two minutes in speed travelled from north to south.

Boys Sight Maneuvering
UFO In 1961

On August 7, 1961 Danny Okrasinski,
12, Route 1, Greenham, Oregon, and
James Powell, 12 also of Route 1, camped
out in a field near their home and while
looking at the stars sighted a strange
light which circled, hovered and started intervals. They claimed it made several passes over Greenham and appeared
to be very large as it came down close
to the ground. They had seen it two
weeks previously and the August 7 sighting was the second time they observed
it.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter requesting information on an aerial observation which you made on 9 August 1961 at Cyprus Gardens, Florida.

We have reviewed the case files for 8, 9, and 10 August 1961 and find that the only report from that area was on 9 August 1960 on a swamp light. Cape Canaveral. This sighting was attributed to a meteor.

The description of your sighting is characteristic of other reports which have been positively identified as jet aircraft. However, we are nevertheless, however, unable to positively identify your sighting due to the present lines.

I am enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book on unidentified flying objects. This report contains the results of our project to date.

Thank you for reporting any unusual aerial object, and if reports should be made to the nearest Air Force Base as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information, Mrs.

2 Apr 65

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
Wash D C 20330

Reference the attached letter from Mrs. requesting information on an observation of hers on Aug 9th, 1961. The following information is provided in order that a reply may be made:

a. We have screened the case files for Aug 8, 9 and 10 of 1961 and find that the only reported observation from the Florida area was at 9pm on 8 Aug 61. This report was from Cape Canaveral and the sighting was attributed to a meteor. The description of your sighting is characteristic of other reports received by us which have been positively identified as jet aircraft with afterburner in operation. I am sure that you realize that it is impossible to attach scientific identification of it at this late date. The attached brochure indicates the results of our project to date.

The Air Force appreciates your reporting of this observation to the Air Force. Should you observe any unusual object a report should be made to the nearest Air Force Base as soon as possible after the sighting.

March 3, 1965,
E. Syracuse, N.Y.

Gentlemen:

During the past 4 years I have been wondering about a most unusual happening. I was visiting Cyprus Gardens in Florida with son and a lady friend on or about Aug. 9, 1961. We saw the evening water show in the pool tank and when this show was over, about 11:17, we headed toward the left, to the parking lot. I spotted an orange tiny star like thing located about 3/4 the way up from the horizon. As I watched it, it got bigger and bigger. (It was a bright orange fire color). As it came down gradually, it seemed to be aimed straight at us.

I suddenly told my son "It must be a meteor or comet."


- page 16 -

2) Running as it enters the earth's surface and heading directly at us:

It reached the lowest position of about 1/3 way up from the horizon then to only an adjustment it made a right turn as I saw it gradually.

In this position it followed a change tail and then it turned back in the exact same direction and headed up at exactly the same angle and continued out of sight completely.

I have no idea of the size of the fall as I could not tell the distance. I felt the object could not be a meteor or comet as it came down then went up.

A comet would either burn up in the atmosphere or fall to the earth. A rocket from earth could go up then down.


- page 17 -

3) My only conclusion is that it must be a U.F.O. as it certainly appeared to be controlled.

I have enclosed a self addressed envelope and would be very grateful to have your honest opinion on my sighting and if other people have further in on seeing this object.

This "thing" has made a deep impressing on me and it is still very clear in my mind. I didn't write in before as I had no address to write to, until I saw the article in the Syracuse Herald-Journal "Air Force report on UFO's".

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for July 22, 1961

Jupiter, Saturn Shine in August
The planet Jupiter is the brightest object in the sky
next to the moon during August. Saturn is a bright as a first
magnitude star, James Stokley reports.

> TWO BRIGHT PLANETS—Jupiter and
Saturn—have joined with the stars forming a
visible at this time of year to make the evening skies of August especially brilliant.
Both planets, and the stars as well, are
down on the accompanying map. These
charts show the sky as it appears about 10
p.m. your own kind of standard time (add
one hour for daylight saving time) at the
first of August, an hour earlier at the middle of the month and two hours earlier at
the end of the month.

Jupiter has a magnitude of minus 2.3, on
the scale used by astronomers for rating the
brilliance of celestial objects. Thus is far
brighter than any other object in the evening sky except the moon, to appear dazzling six except the moon, to appear dazzling
to identify. It has been in the constellation
of Capricornus, the sea goat, but in early
August moves next door into Sagittarius,
the archer, in the southern sky.

About five degrees to the west (right) is
Saturn. Its magnitude is plus 0-8 so it ranks
as a first magnitude star, which means it is
about a twelfth as bright as Jupiter. Both
of these planets are visible as soon as it gets
dark and remain in view until shortly
before sunrise.

The handle is toward Saturn, and the spout
of the right, toward the next constellation
of Scorpius, the scorpion. In the left-hand
end of this group, the stars are in a curved
line that suggests a question mark. This
is the way the figure was pictured in the
old star maps. The modern astronomer, of
course, ignores these picturesque old figures, of lions, bears and dogs as well as
scorpions.

At the center of the scorpion is a bright
star called Antares, which is
about half as bright as Saturn.

Looking higher in the southern sky, you
can see two other stars of the first magnitude. Directly above Jupiter is Aquila, the
eagle; to the left of Saturn is Vega—virtually overhead, in fact—you find
Vega, in Lyra, the lyre. Below this group,
toward the east, is Cygnus, the swan, shown
partly on the southern map, partly on the
northern map. The brightest star in Cygnus, the brightest star in Cygnus, is shown.

The Big Dipper, which is a part of Ursa
Major, the great bear, shines in the northwest. In it are the pointers, the two stars in
the dipper's bowl that show the direction
of Polaris, the pole star. Although of course it always stands in about the same
position in the north.

If you follow the handle of the dipper,
and continue its curve to the left, it will
take you to a well-known bright star called. This is Arcturus, in Bootes, the herdsman.

Stay up late on August nights and you
may see another planet, for Venus rises
in the east about three hours before the sun.
Its magnitude is now about minus 3.5
which makes it about three times as bright
as Jupiter. Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are
the only planets now visible; the others
that are sometimes visible without a telescope, Mercury and Mars, are too early in
the sun's direction to be seen.

From about the middle of August to the
end of the month, the moon will be near
evening hours. On Friday, Aug. 25, it will
be full, rising in the east as the sun is
setting in the west.

During that night the moon will pass
through the shadow of earth, producing a
lunar eclipse. At 10:50 p.m. EST, the
eclipse will be at its height. It will not be
quite totally eclipsed as a narrow sliver of
the moon's surface will remain illuminated
by the direct rays of the sun.

The shadow of our planet actually has
a reddish tinge, and the moon will appear
umber, where the globe would completely
hide the sun. But around it is a larger
region, called the penumbra, where the sun
is only partly hidden. At 7:20 p.m. EST
the moon will be rising in the eastern part
of the western part of the United States, of
course, the moon will not have risen when
this happens.

Bait for Termite Trap Found in Decaying Wood

A BAIT that attracts mice has been isolated as cheese attracts mice. It has been found to lure termites away from wood in tests which do hundreds of millions of dollars of damage each year in the United States alone.

The bait, in relatively pure form a colorless oil, is a more or less natural lure to cause it is extracted from the termite's intestinal tract. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that certain of these fungi or their products help form powerful attractants that guide the termites to an edible piece of wood.

Casida and R. D. Shemelof of the University of Wisconsin and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, both in Madison, Wis., tested the attracting powers of several kinds of fungi and found that neither healthy wood alone nor fungus alone attracted termites.

In combination, however, wood and fungus made a very good lure.

The most powerful attractant was produced in pure wood inoculated with the brown rot fungus Lenzites trabea. All three kinds of termites tested preferred the wood decayed by this particular fungus, and within two minutes most of them had clustered around the wood parts well away from the original inoculation point. In this part of the wood attracted the insects even faster than the whole wood. Every termite in a test box gathered around a pad containing the extract within 30 seconds.

The research was reported in Science, 134:50, 1961.

GENERAL SCIENCE

Colleges Buy Own Tools, But U.S. Pays for Work

COLLEGES and universities doing scientific research buy most of their own equipment and foot the bulk of the bill for building new laboratories or remodeling old ones.

It is Federal money, however, that makes possible the actual research work.

These are the chief findings in a National Science Foundation survey of research and development costs at the college level during the fiscal year 1959. Figures have been gathered and processed.

The 238 independent institutions of higher learning reporting on capital outlays for research facilities and other items spent $153,590,000. The Government's share was $41,361,000 or about one-fourth.

Operating expenditures for budgeted research and development during the same year totaled about $740,700,000. Federal support for research amounted to 73% of this, or about $540,700,000.

The Foundation notes: "In may be seen that the role of the Federal Government in the support of research and development was reversed from that of support of capital items to the support of the research process."

Some 50% of the total capital expenditures went to the life sciences, reflecting the need for costly medical facilities. Some 30% went to engineering and 20% to the social sciences, the report says.

The report, No. 28 in a Foundation series on "Reviews of Data on Research and Development," is available for five cents from the National Science Foundation, Washington 25, D.C.

BIOCHEMISTRY

Virus Particles Line Up At a Certain Stage

AT A CERTAIN STAGE of growth within a cell, the particles of at least one type of virus line up in an orderly column. A research team at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons studied the arrangement of virus particles that causes a germ-like disease in man, in kidney cells from the rhesus monkey. They found that the virus particles arrange themselves along parallel filaments within the cell.

Cut in cross section and magnified 258,000 times, the particular arrangement is hexagonal. In this arrangement, the particles, somewhat askew, each particle is surrounded by six others and membrane can be seen.

The particle arrangements seem to accumulate around particular arrangement in the cell at one stage of growth and then move out to the edge. Finally the particles seem to escape through the cell membrane and the cell may disintegrate.

The incomplete particles serve as a protective incubator for the virus particles. The morphologic particles being numerous during this stage are never found outside the cell. Such evidence indicates that the incomplete particle is unstable.

OLD HUNGARIAN CHURCH To Be Kept in Glass Case

AN ANCIENT CHURCH in Hungary will be preserved for posterity in a glass case.

The church, located at the village Zsambek 20 miles from Budapest and now in ruins, will be restored in two stages. First the stones scattered around the church will be gathered and then the entire nave, along with the stone walls are missing, will be secured in glass.

The glass covering will be supported by a light metal framework and will help prevent further damage to the church.

The restoration is being carried out with Prof. Frigyes Pogany of the Budapest Technical University. Many colleges from the University are supporting the restoration project.

TECHNOLOGY

Irradiated Plastics Become Semiconductors

IRRADIATION of chlorinated plastics with ultraviolet light converts them into semiconductors, the materials from which transistors and related electronic items are made.

This discovery is reported in Nature, by Gerald Oser, Greta K. Oser and Marian Kryszewski of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, N. Y. They used the chlorinated plastic, saran, for their experiments. Ultraviolet light is in the infrared region with wavelengths shorter than visible light.

They found that at the border of irradiated samples also showed photoconductivity in that they could conduct an electric current when exposed to light. The photoconductivity appears to be due to trapped, unpaired electrons.
