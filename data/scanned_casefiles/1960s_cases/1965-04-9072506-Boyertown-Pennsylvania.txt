BACKGROUND
Considerable confusion exists regarding the nature of the incident reported here. Although the observer claims to have seen a bright, hovering light source, the lack of specific details or corroborating evidence makes a definitive conclusion difficult. Further investigation would be necessary to determine the exact nature of the observed phenomenon.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch depicts some sort of structure or building, along with various lines, shapes, and annotations. The text in the image describes the observer's account of an object observed, mentioning details such as flashing lights and a slight bank to the left. The text also mentions multiple reflections from the object observed.

In the observers account at Charles and town street, about 15 miles north of Troy, N.Y., observer noted pasting deltas vine jet flickered between the ground and the sky, their position expressing a slight bank to the left, followed by strong distraction caused by object observed simultaneously at 2 places followed by object reappearance at 1, course followed by object approximately as shown in sketch.

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Enclosed is the UFO report I referred to on the phone today. I hope you have better luck tracking down this object than I did finding the meteorite that prompted the correspondence between Mr. Gifford and me.

I will certainly attempt to convey any further reports of this nature to you in the future.

Sincerely,

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCES: SAUCER NEWS September 1965

26 APRIL 1965
NEW LONDON, MINNESOTA

NEAR-LANDING IN MINNESOTA: A nine-year-old boy, named Gary G__, was near New London, Minnesota on 26th. He says that he usually does nothing unusual around the place, but on this particular day, something very unusual happened to him. It then raised a "stick" of some sort, resembling an antenna, and seemed to be sending out information of some kind. It then returned the "stick" as though it had received the information it wanted. The boy kept observing the object from a distance of about 50 yards, but could see nothing. It then rose slowly into the air and when it had reached a height of about 15 feet, it darted rapidly away. The whole incident lasted about 10 seconds.

NO CASE (Information Only)
Source: Dublin, Ireland - Apr. 5, 1965
Fireball Over Howth, Ireland
Mr. John Staunton and Mrs. Staunton of Dublin, Ireland were traveling by car to the Summit Inn at Howth Head on the 5th of April 1965 when they observed a UFO. Miss Ward told the Dublin Evening Herald that they were on Clontarf Road when she spotted what appeared to be "a globe of brilliant light" in the sky above the South Dublin Coast. 
On March 31, at 3:30 a.m. Mr. D., who works in a filling depot, saw a brilliant white light come from the west, pass a point in the sky above the planet Mars, hover for a while, then "shoot up" into the sky. It was so bright he could hardly look at it.
On April 7th at 4 a.m., Mr. D. was in about the same spot when he saw, in approximately the same direction as the object on the 31st, a bluish-white pear-shaped object which "shot up" into the sky.
Representatives Austin Byrnes that the object appeared to be the "size" of a tennis ball but could have been very large and at a great distance. It came in from the East, finally disappeared southward. Staunton also said the object appeared to come toward him and then to recede in a kind of "wave motion".

Dear Mr. -----

This is a reply to your letter received on with our 15 September 1965.

I regret to inform you that we have not been able to identify the flying object which you observed on 12 August 1965. While your description of the object is very detailed, we do not have any photographs or other physical evidence with which to make a positive identification. Such sightings are frequently created by natural phenomena such as aircraft, satellites, astronomical objects, or meteorological conditions. In this case, the available information is not sufficient to determine the exact nature of the object you observed.

Sincerely,
Pennsylvania

UDO Observation, 30 Apr 65, Boyertown, Pa
To: IQ USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the attached letter from reporting
an unidentified flying object on the night of 30 Apr 65. The
following is a suggested reply:
The objects observed by you and your son on the night
of 30 Apr 65 would appear to be many reports of lights in
the sky which are frequently reported. These objects are
gathered with the duration of 3-6 seconds and the distance traveled
is in accordance with that of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena which
only during very bright moonlight or when they are close enough
to the observer to achieve apparent size can a ground source be
determined. Sightings of this nature, while they are of
brief period of time, do accumulate and are considered of
interest as an average of these and four times a year.

3. It was observed by at least 9 persons, all of whom were reliable and credible witnesses.
The shy in the west was clear, and also in the northeast, but directly over head it was overcast and there were no reference stars visible. The object came and did not change position as a normal star would. They came and went, remaining in the same relative position for long periods of time and as mentioned, moved off at a very high rate of speed. They were observed at all times.
The Center of this object appeared gray or grayish in color and about the size of a dime held at arm's length.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting several circular objects and a smudged or blacked-out area at the bottom of the frame, which appears to represent something like a vehicle or object. The text appears to be a written description or account related to the image.

Your report requested text extraction, so here is the text from the document:

"...seeing over a hundred particles of light. These particle lights are very small and moving sometimes erratically. To their observation they are guided (controlled) definitely, and (7) objects.

This is the very thing they are apt to call unidentified. 

Yours truly,

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a typed page from a document, possibly a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

On the night of April 1st, Mrs. Elizabeth Charnney of Boston, Mass., was returning home with her 11-year-old son when she made a remarkable sighting of a cigar-shaped object not more than 150 yards in the air. It had four windows and a red light. In the rear, which was alternately bright and dim, she watched as it made some maneuvers for about 15 minutes, whereupon it was joined by these smaller objects. Shortly thereafter, all four objects disappeared at the same time. As soon as the UFOs were out of sight, Mrs. Charnney saw seven Air Force planes in the area. Said Mrs. Charnney "I think they were from Hanscom Field in Bedford. They seemed to be searching for something!".

The image contains a photograph or diagram illustrating the route and sighting of a UFO observed by Mrs. E. Charney at Westford, Massachusetts. The diagram shows the path of the object, which had a bright white light, red pulsating lights, and a dark body. The text describes Mrs. Charney's observation, including details about the object's movement, size, and effect as it passed over the area.

U.A.O. SCOUTS TOWN IN EAST
Mrs. Evelyn Charney and her son Steven, 16, were sitting outside their home in Westford, Mass., at 9:40 P.M. on April 9, 1965, when they observed an unusual bright object in the sky. There was no sound but the object was so bright that it illuminated the ground over a distance of 1 mile away. The library is located in the Center of Westford and its high elevation for miles around. Upon leaving, Mrs. Charney stopped at the library steps and both spotted a bright red light and what appeared to be a very narrow window.
As Mrs. Charney watched, the object started a slow wide turn to its left, and Mrs. Charney glanced up to her son who was pointing out something else in the sky. When she looked back, the object was continuing in its turn for several minutes, always holding the same shape and brightness.
The object moved past the high school, the red lights seemed to dim and the "windows" gleamed brightly. It passed to the other side of the hill and disappeared. Mrs. Charney timed the sighting from the moment the object appeared until it was out of sight - this was approximately 15 minutes. The diagrams illustrate the route of the object seen at Westford Center, as seen by Mrs. Charney's route during her observation of it. The Charneys then saw two other aircraft circling Westford and they continued to do so for 30 or 40 minutes, much higher than the UFO.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document. The text describes an event where a couple in Washington observed a bright object hovering over a lake on the night of April 3, 1965. The report describes the object's appearance and the witness's observations.

Waiting Light In Washington

"It was like a Science fiction thing you see on TV," said Donald Peterson of Seattle, Washington, of the object he, his wife and another couple observed while staying at the Peterson's cabin on Whidbey Island, Washington.

On the night of the 3rd of April 1965 the two couples were outside when they heard a wailing noise like a dog howling. "It is usually so quiet up there that we noticed it at once," Peterson told reporters later.

Peterson first saw a reflection in the water, then looked up and saw a bright object apparently hovering over the Lake in the direction of Recreation and Crescent. He looked at it through a rifle scope but could see no details because of its brilliance. Peterson then shot his rifle into the air to see if that had any effect. It apparently did't. Fifteen minutes later the bright object disappeared, leaving clusters of different-colored lights behind.

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT, VALLEY FALLS, N.Y. - 9 APRIL 1965
DATE: 26 APRIL 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, NICAP Investigating Subcommittee, Chelmsford, Mass.
TO: NICAP, 1536 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
ATTN: Richard Hall

The attached report provides information concerning a UFO sighting on 9 April 1965, 10:15 AM EST at Valley Falls, N.Y. 

Mr. Gifford has specifically requested that his name not appear in any publication. His reason for this is because he is not familiar with NICAP and its policies, and would ensure that the latest copy of the "UFO INVESTIGATOR" be sent to him from NICAP headquarters along with a request to use his name if it is decided that his report is worth publishing.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Investigator
