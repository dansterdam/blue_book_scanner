BACKGROUND
Considerable confusion exists regarding the nature of the incident reported here. Although the observer claims to have seen a bright, hovering light source, the lack of specific details or corroborating evidence makes a definitive conclusion difficult. Further investigation would be necessary to determine the exact nature of the observed phenomenon.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch depicts some sort of structure or building, along with various lines, shapes, and annotations. The text in the image describes the observer's account of an object observed, mentioning details such as flashing lights and a slight bank to the left. The text also mentions multiple reflections from the object observed.

In the observers account at Charles and town street, about 15 miles north of Troy, N.Y., observer noted pasting deltas vine jet flickered between the ground and the sky, their position expressing a slight bank to the left, followed by strong distraction caused by object observed simultaneously at 2 places followed by object reappearance at 1, course followed by object approximately as shown in sketch.

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Enclosed is the UFO report I referred to on the phone today. I hope you have better luck tracking down this object than I did finding the meteorite that prompted the correspondence between Mr. Gifford and me.

I will certainly attempt to convey any further reports of this nature to you in the future.

Sincerely,
James E. Cornell, Jr.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCES: SAUCER NEWS September 1965

26 APRIL 1965
NEW LONDON, MINNESOTA

NEAR-LANDING IN MINNESOTA: A nine-year-old boy, named Gary G__, was near New London, Minnesota on 26th. He says that he usually does nothing unusual around the place, but on this particular day, something very unusual happened to him. It then raised a "stick" of some sort, resembling an antenna, and seemed to be sending out information of some kind. It then returned the "stick" as though it had received the information it wanted. The boy kept observing the object from a distance of about 50 yards, but could see nothing. It then rose slowly into the air and when it had reached a height of about 15 feet, it darted rapidly away. The whole incident lasted about 10 seconds.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a "Flying Saucer Review" document, dated 7 Apr 65, Vienna, Aus. The text on the page describes an "AUSTRIA Formation flight" incident, where a report from Vienna on April 8, 1965 states that four bright objects were observed for approximately 8 seconds. The objects were visible for between 4 to 8 seconds and were described as bright, luminous objects.

NO CASE (Information Only)
Source: Dublin, Ireland - Apr. 5, 1965
Fireball Over Howth, Ireland
Mr. John Staunton and Mrs. Staunton of Dublin, Ireland were traveling by car to the Summit Inn at Howth Head on the 5th of April 1965 when they observed a UFO. Miss Ward told the Dublin Evening Herald that they were on Clontarf Road when she spotted what appeared to be "a globe of brilliant light" in the sky above the South Dublin Coast. 
On March 31, at 3:30 a.m. Mr. D., who works in a filling depot, saw a brilliant white light come from the west, pass a point in the sky above the planet Mars, hover for a while, then "shoot up" into the sky. It was so bright he could hardly look at it.
On April 7th at 4 a.m., Mr. D. was in about the same spot when he saw, in approximately the same direction as the object on the 31st, a bluish-white pear-shaped object which "shot up" into the sky.
Representatives Austin Byrnes that the object appeared to be the "size" of a tennis ball but could have been very large and at a great distance. It came in from the East, finally disappeared southward. Staunton also said the object appeared to come toward him and then to recede in a kind of "wave motion".

Dear Mr. -----

This is a reply to your letter received on with our 15 September 1965.

I regret to inform you that we have not been able to identify the flying object which you observed on 12 August 1965. While your description of the object is very detailed, we do not have any photographs or other physical evidence with which to make a positive identification. Such sightings are frequently created by natural phenomena such as aircraft, satellites, astronomical objects, or meteorological conditions. In this case, the available information is not sufficient to determine the exact nature of the object you observed.

Sincerely,
Pennsylvania

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document. The text describes an event where a couple in Washington observed a bright object hovering over a lake on the night of April 3, 1965. The report describes the object's appearance and the witness's observations.

Waiting Light In Washington

"It was like a Science fiction thing you see on TV," said Donald Peterson of Seattle, Washington, of the object he, his wife and another couple observed while staying at the Peterson's cabin on Whidbey Island, Washington.

On the night of the 3rd of April 1965 the two couples were outside when they heard a wailing noise like a dog howling. "It is usually so quiet up there that we noticed it at once," Peterson told reporters later.

Peterson first saw a reflection in the water, then looked up and saw a bright object apparently hovering over the Lake in the direction of Recreation and Crescent. He looked at it through a rifle scope but could see no details because of its brilliance. Peterson then shot his rifle into the air to see if that had any effect. It apparently did't. Fifteen minutes later the bright object disappeared, leaving clusters of different-colored lights behind.

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT, VALLEY FALLS, N.Y. - 9 APRIL 1965
DATE: 26 APRIL 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, NICAP Investigating Subcommittee, Chelmsford, Mass.
TO: NICAP, 1536 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
ATTN: Richard Hall

The attached report provides information concerning a UFO sighting on 9 April 1965, 10:15 AM EST at Valley Falls, N.Y. 

Mr. Gifford has specifically requested that his name not appear in any publication. His reason for this is because he is not familiar with NICAP and its policies, and would ensure that the latest copy of the "UFO INVESTIGATOR" be sent to him from NICAP headquarters along with a request to use his name if it is decided that his report is worth publishing.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Investigator
