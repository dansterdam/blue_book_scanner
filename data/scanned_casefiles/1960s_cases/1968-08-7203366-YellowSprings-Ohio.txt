    Although Dr. J. A. Hynek feels that the sighting should be evaluated as unidentified or as plane, the sighting is being considered as having probable Dr. Marcel of Dayton characteristics. The observer sighted a large yellow, gold and white light seen at a distance. The observer estimated that at one time it was only about 300 feet above her car and that a disc at some length would have covered only 1/50 of it. The observer also said that the object made a spinning noise and that a small similar to that of German planes of WWII and seemed to be spinning.

Text extracted from the document:

YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO
AUGUST 12, 1968

At approximately 12:50 AM on August 12, 1968, the observer was getting ready to leave her home to go to work. As she was going out the front door, she observed an unusual object coming from the north. The object was hovering over a field approximately 1/30 of a mile from her home. 

The object appeared to be about the size of a large car. It had a light on the top. She observed the object for approximately 15 minutes. During this time, the object hovered and occasionally moved back and forth in a horizontal motion across the field. The object seemed to be lit up from within. At one point, the object tilted and she could see the bottom of it, which appeared to be concave.

The observer called her relatives, but they saw nothing. The object eventually moved away to the north, increased in speed, and disappeared from sight. The observer stated she could not hear any sound from the object.

The duration of the sighting was about 15 minutes. The witness stated that during this time the object was visible, it seemed to move effortlessly and silently. It did not seem to have any visible propulsion system. The witness stated she felt uneasy about the experience and had no longer been able to sleep well since the occurrence.

Xenia derives its name from the Greek and signifies hospitality.
