10. CONCLUSION
Astro (MOON)
Although Dr J A Hynek feels that the sighting should be evaluated as unidentified or as plasma, the sighting is being evaluated as the moon. Dr Menzel of Harvard has completed an analysis of the sighting.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a large yellow, gold and white light that was about the size of a large moon. The observer estimated that at one time it was only about 300 feet above her car and that a dime at arms length would have covered only 1/50 of it. The observer also said that the object made a groaning noise had a small similar to the German planes of WW II and seemed to be spinning.

YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO

August 19, 1968

At approximately 12:30 AM on August 19, 1968, the observer was driving home near Yellow Springs, Ohio that some object which appeared to be a luminous solid, disc shaped object, was seen 100 feet above an automobile. The object was yellow, gold and white in color, it had a spinning motion, and made a groaning noise. The observer estimated the disc was 15 to 20 feet in diameter and was spinning as some length. The observer stated that the object was approximately following her car lighting, because when the object was close to her, she felt a cold breeze. Upon arriving home, the observer went inside to get her in-laws. Then the observer and her relatives came out of the house. The observer again saw the object and it appeared smaller and she could no longer hear noise. The observer estimated that, at this time, about 1/4 to 1/2 of the object was now gone. Upon returning to her home, the object was the moon but rejected this hypothesis because of the appearance of the object. She also observed a blue haze of 15 to 20 yards in the area which they attributed to the object. On or about 2 weeks later, she noted that the odor was similar in smell to that of WW II German airplane fuel.

Background Data: The duration of the sighting was about 1/2 hour, and during this time the object was seen initially in the NW to NE sky. All the witnesses stated that the object was similar in shape to the moon but did not feel it could have been the moon. Apparently, it disappeared at once. More than one observer saw the moon, and to the fact that the moon was well above the horizon in the eastern sky during the sighting. There was a strong temperature inversion in the area at the time. The object changed color, showed a strong temperature (stratification), and may cause smaller images to appear to move somewhat. No other suggested explanation was found. Reported to Yellow Springs Police Department, the Greene County Sheriff's Office, or Wright Patterson AFB.

Comments: Although Dr J Allen Hynek, the Air Force Scientific Consultant on UFOs, feels that the sighting should be evaluated as a possible astronomical event, the Air Force feels that the sighting was the result of a weather condition and was one of the sightings of the moon which stimulated the observers to be curious. Harvard College Observatory completed an extensive analysis of the sighting and also feels that the observation was of the moon.

Here is the text from the document:

[Left side is a Road Index listing numerous roads alphabetically]

Greene County, Ohio, named for General Nathaniel Greene, was established in its present boundaries in 1805 and admitted to the Union in 1803. Greene County stretched for the south to the then north line of the new state.

The oldest settlement in Greene County appears to be Clio (now Old Town), a village of the Shawnee Indians, with a population of 1100 persons around 1778. The first white settlers was founded by John Wilson and his sons, Amos, John, George, each built a log shelter at Clio (now Ferry) in the southwest in 1796.

The first county business was transacted in a small log house near Alpha on the banks of the Beaver Creek. The Court House in Xenia was finished in 1809 at a cost of $3,396. The was built in 1902 at an approximate cost of $192,000.

Xenia, which was established as the county seat in 1805, was the center of the county's business and government.
