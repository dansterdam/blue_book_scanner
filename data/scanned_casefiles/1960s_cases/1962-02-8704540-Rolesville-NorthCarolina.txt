Dear Sirs:

I would like to inform you of what I saw on the date of Feb.12,1952. I was looking at the moon at approximately 4:17 P.M. with binoculars. When I saw a strange object fling between me and the moon. It was fling at a high altitude at a northern direction at a 85 degree angle. It was fling over Rolesville,N.C. near Raleigh.

It looked something like a jet but it was going so fast I could hardly keep up with it. It was going three or four times as fast as any of our jet that I have seen. It was a jet it was very small object to be visible perhaps. Will please reply this letter because I am very curious.

It looked something like this.

Sincerely yours,

P.S.
If you do not take letters like this send it to someone who does. Thank you.
