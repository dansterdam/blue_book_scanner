Dear Sir:

I am sure much interested in H.F.O. I just was a article in the Cleveland Press, saying there went much sighting to H.F.O. - I here are many who see then but they do not make the report. I belong to an H.F.O. group, I do they watched. Of home from my window it was much 15 or 16 or where I saw a bright light stop, light went from a other site an air to go to the S or T. It was a small. It was bright as a satellite. At arms length it would cover a nickel.

The strangest I have seen was in march, date I have forgotten but it must be around 7 or 11 it travel from east to west not very high in the sky from "the" up stairs window

a sandy

Blue White streak

This is white & I couldn't
make out

It went so fast I couldn't make
out what was in front of it
before I had a chance it went
behind a cloud - the blue streak
lasted 5 sec. It was the most
beautiful thing I have ever seen -
It was big but not armed length - from
my elbow to the tip of my finger
(Beautiful)
