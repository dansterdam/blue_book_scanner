The image contains a newspaper article clipping discussing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred over Cincinnati, Ohio on August 31, 1961. The article describes how the object was sighted by multiple observers and how it disappeared from view, leaving the witnesses baffled. There is no photograph present in this image.

OCR Text Output:

WE SIGHTED OVER CINCINNATI. 

The Enquirer last night was checking reports of strange sightings in the Cincinnati area. A dispatcher at the Cincinnati Airport said the sighting occurred about 7:15 P.M. yesterday in Cincinnati. The single light above the horizon suddenly disappeared. It was seen for several minutes, about.
To all appearances, it was a complete mystery to the Cincinnati observers. 
Cincinnati Airport stated that Cincinnati International Airport personnel reported strange sightings in the skyline between 7 and 7:45 P.M. yesterday, and that Cincinnati Airport eliminated the possibility of any conventional aircraft in the area at that time.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from a document. The document appears to be a letter dated September 8, 1961 from an individual in Monroe, Ohio to the Wright Air Development Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Wright Air Development Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am 12 years old and I am very interested in rockets and UFO's. On Sept. 2 I saw a late movie on flying saucer reports.

This movie mentioned an incident that I wanted to tell you about. The object that flew over Cincinnati might have been a "Flying Saucer".

One of the UFO's in this movie changed its color while travelling through the air. It changed form white to amber.

I saw the same UFO when it first came out of the northeast and headed southwest. However, the color was very bit as fast as the changing of the object in the movie.

In the movie I was telling you about, the object changed color. When I first saw the UFO it was white and was heading towards Cincinnati.

I would like to know if you think that the object I saw could be like the one in the movie.

I would also like to know if you know what it is or would you call it a UFO.

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
[signature redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As per your request, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

The object went down over the horizon.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe, in your own words, a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The object looked very much like a star very bright and shiny at first but as it was passing over it got larger and looked like the shape of Echo and it moved across the sky very fast. We know that it was not Echo because it was not blinking lights on it like Echo has.

The image contains three illustrations. The first illustration is a sketch depicting a curved path showing how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second illustration shows a larger sketch of the object's position when the observer first saw it, and a smaller sketch of the object's position at a later time. The third illustration shows a person standing on a road, looking up at something in the sky.

In the following text, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
