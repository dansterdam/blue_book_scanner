DATE Sept. 28, 1961

At 8:54 at my friend's I looked up toward the NE and saw a light about the size of the planet Jupiter. It moved toward the SW at a steady speed and it passed over a USAF Transport Plane. It stayed on an electrical course and disappeared in the SW. My friend and I watched it for over two minutes as it traveled about as fast as the Echo satellite. It was heading for Cincinnati and as it did, it turned color, from white to a faint red.

I heard on the television that might that a red object coming from the

NE exploded over Cincinnati.

August 31, 1961
from the
Cincinnati Enquirer

The Enquirer last night was checking on reports of a strange red light in the sky above Cincinnati. At the sighting agreed that it was a flickering red light, first seen in the northeast. It headed southeast at a high angle above the horizon.

Suddenly it exploded into a brilliant white light, then disappeared. It was seen for several minutes about 9 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. It was a complete mystery to the Weather Bureau, Greater Cincinnati Airport Tower and Cincinnati Moonwatch Team. Possible explanations: An airplane, meteor or satellite.

Dear Sirs:

I am 14 years old and I am very interested in rockets and UFO's.

On Sept. 2, I saw a late movie on flying saucer reports.

This was what I needed to tell me that the object that flew over Cincinnati might have been a "Flying Saucer."

One of the UFO's in this movie changed its color as it traveled through the air. It changed form white to amber.

I saw the UFO when it first came out of the northeast and headed southwest. It was traveling every bit as fast as the Echo satellite travels.

In the movie I was telling you about, the object changed color. When I first saw the UFO it was white and was heading toward Cincinnati.

I would like to know if you think that this object could be like the one in the movie.

I would also like to know what it is or would you call it a UFO.

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound None
b. Color White

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A small arrow is drawn on the sketch area]

(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
             b. Like a bright spot

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion then the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[A small hand-drawn sketch appears to be present, but details are not clear]

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
It looked about the size of the Echo satellite

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The whole thing

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching? If so, how?
No, except when it went over the horizon.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe, in your own words, a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.
We are both used to seeing the Echo satellite go over head, but we thought at first it might be it, but it was going in the wrong direction.
It was the size of Echo and it moved about as fast as Echo.
We know that it was not Echo because it went from NE to the SW.
