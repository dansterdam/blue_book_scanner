5 Sept 1962.

Ida, 20, 1962
Sandpoint, Idaho

Wright-Patterson AFB Free Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sir:

I am inclosing some fragments of a substance which my brother and I believe to be a meteorite, that we found five miles east of Priest Lake.

We are not doing this work at the time and on the evening of the fifth of September we left our equipment at the side of a lake. The next morning when we went to work, we found the substance close to our equipment. It had not been there the evening before.

What it was, I noticed the free middle and other of the usual debris of the woods had been charred black, although they were very damp from rain.

It somewhat resembles a coal clinker, but a clinker in usually glassy and harder than this substance. Also this was no coal burning thing within miles of where we found it, so no clue relative can possibly then deposited there, while it was hot enough to fuse what it fell on.

It fell with considerable force as it made a dent in the ground about an inch and one half deep and scattered the small fragments which we measured from our own ground.

We have a piece three and three-fourth inches


- page 3 -

Long, two and a half inches wide and one and one half inches thick, and several small pieces. We would have sent it to you long ago but we were not sure that you would be interested, so there is so many facts things claimed to be found.

We are very certain that the substance which we are sending to you fell from the sky. It also would have had to fall from an easterly or north-easterly direction, or it would have hit trees from any other direction and would have been completely broken up.

If you find that it is a part of a meteorite or of some other thing will you please let us know.

Sincerely yours.

On the evening of September 2nd, Mr. and Mrs. Albert Saclgiano of Chicago, Illinois made a close sighting. They were sitting on the porch of their home when they had a time passage, like in free the inside, with a new or red lights around its center. It was flying slowly just above the tops of the trees.

On 30 September 1962, a farmer named Juan Sosa was riding home on his bicycle, in a personally-settled part of the province of San Juan, Argentina, when he saw a flying saucer take off from a field about 200 yards from the road. As he took off, 14 bright round objects gathered together several times, all of whom had seen the UFO in the sky earlier in the evening. Reportedly, they all were back in the landing, caught a flashlight, and found that the ground seemed burned in their shape of a circle, three yards in diameter. - The same object or a similar one was also seen by two local residents of San Juan.
