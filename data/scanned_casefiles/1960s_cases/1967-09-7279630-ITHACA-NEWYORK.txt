Dear Sir:

The following information is forwarded for your review.

The actual sighting occurred on 21 September 1967, however, it was not possible to obtain the attached infrared photo until 6 February 1968.

Mr. Kenneth Fletcher is a free lance photographer specializing in infrared work. The equipment used was a Mamiya, Autolux 35 Camera. Settings were 1/30 second, ASA 20 Automatic, F 2.8. Film was Kodak Infrared IR 135-20. Filter used was Kodak Wratten "A" filter, number 25. He developed the film using Microdol X, Standard dilution for 20 minutes. Mr. Fletcher was still holding the film, but is reluctant to release it (I suspect he is preparing a magazine article). The attached newspaper account is submitted to serve as narrative. Weather was not a factor; it was a clear, cold night.

Sincerely

Object Moves Toward Cruiser'

The Strange Case of Police and the UFOs
By ED KOTAR

[Most of the first paragraph is illegible due to image quality]

...the Very Block, his last news reporter with
the Lowell police with the first active period
of the UFO.

In September actually, Ken Fletcher, an event
photographer who recently retired from Lowell
police, took and mailed a photo "shot in Lowell"
which was sharp picture of the object.

But Fletcher's picture, taken with infrared film, and his
own account of the incident are not available for publication. The process of telling this peculiar story
reportedly has at least three national magazines in the
works.

Basically Fletcher was sure he had something on his
mind and a good story claim that he "declared up the
line" to a state officer in the dark room during the
process.

The sighting of a bright, swirling object in the
Lowell area was reported in July by Berna Jerzewski,
and a UFO sighting report was sent to the Lowell
police in a regular effort, to Hyneck.

[Several more paragraphs are partially illegible]

[Caption under photo]: LOWELL POLICE CHIEF Avery Block, left, learns and I went to the craft, said Hyneck, here beside him is one of his officers, Jim Hanson, explain how he saw an unidentified flying object which seemed to be maneuvered by the light on its cruiser.

UFO Observation September 30, 1967

E. Syracuse, N. Y. 13057

1. This replies to your letter of December 30, 1967 in which you requested information on your unidentified observation of September 30, 1967.

2. The description that you provided on your observation, is consistent with other reports that we have received of plastic garment bag hot air balloons. These balloons usually appear as a luminescent object that is red, orange, yellow or white in color, and usually uses birthday candles for a heat source. After the candles burn down, the stage or platform on which the candles are mounted on sometimes catches fire and sparks can be seen falling from the object. Shortly after the fiery pieces fall the light dims and disappears.

3. We have requested weather data for your area for September 30. If the object that you saw was going in the direction of the surface winds it seems very likely that it was indeed a hot air balloon that you observed.

4. Enclosed is an extract from AFR 80-17 regarding dissemination of information to the public. (Section B, AFR 80-17)

5. We hope that the enclosed Blue Book brochure will be both interesting and informative. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Here is the text from the document:

count illustrated in Ex. 1 is probably too small...the writer seems to recall in the one or several attempts made to take a visual count (of the objects nearest dim. «3 that he lost the count once at seventeen, and another time at nineteen. In other words the count of the objects nearest dim. «3 probably was not less than thirty or more than fifty, sixty, or seven. Note in regard to the length of dimension «D: the writer made a mechanical estimate, approximately five times the length of the short dimension. This might vary possibly from three times the length of the short side to perhaps seven times the length of the short side. Estimated total count of disc units, 3,645.

To measure triangular distance between observer and white circular disc nearest point «a first state he thinks these dimensions are relatively small for two reasons: first, there is no possibility the UFO units being overhead (of West ave.) from visual observation, and were merely observed as being near West ave. and two, unusually, the writer had to hold his head backward somewhat and additionally roll his eyes back somewhat to view the circular white unit nearest point «a; the curious circumstance is further emphasized by stating that a certain amount of relief from this manner of viewing was done instinctively, without thought, by mounting several of the first set of steps leading from the street to writer's residence, in order to view the circular white units nearest observer. Since we have a very good determination to dimension «b (of course we have also a very good determination in regard to dimension «D, in preceding paragraphs), be previously estimated at five hundred feet; ac estimated, five hundred feet; ab estimated, seven hundred feet.

Perspective View Overall From Observer's Vantage Point, an illustration made for the reader's mind's eye or imaginative initial view, and not for purposes of exactness or accuracy of dimensions. Notes the linear outline dip, not yet appear, and is here used for convenience only, to avoid rendering the figure as actually composed of circular white discs.


- page 13 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Indicate to this observer the existence of a plane, rectangular figure, for instance, dimension «B appeared to equal several feet in perspective measurement (Rule of arm length) while dimension CD divided down to several inches, a striking view when one considers the absolutely regular size and positioning, previously noted, of the individual discs which make up the object. The writer did not at the time of the observation make a perspective measurement, data related thereto is from recollection. Be that as it may, and with the understanding that a competent mathematician may derive a figure of a different form than that of the writer, the following estimates are made from recollection: at point «, the nearest white disc-like object thereto appeared to be at an altitude of several hundred feet, perhaps five hundred feet, and of a perspective diameter approximately one inch. Near symbol Q, the UFO unit nearest thereto, at altitude in excess of one thousand feet, perhaps twelve or thirteen hundred feet; and a diameter with a perspective dimension of several sixtenths of an inch, perhaps three or four sixtenths of an inch; at points C and D, the nearest UFO units thereto, at altitude of several thousands of feet, estimated twenty-two hundred feet, and of a perspective dimension of several sixty-fourths of an inch, possibly a sixteenth of an inch.

Immobility of the UFO and the disc or wafer units. The object remained fixed and immobile during the observation period. Do note know how terminated. After observing same for perhaps fifteen minutes decided that all there was to observe had been seen and consequently retired to residence in rooming house at address noted. Do not know at what juncture the object came into existence. The writer was returning to residence from lunch in early or mid-afternoon «t approximately when about to turn off 10 steps or residence, noticed said UFO of circular white discs in sky above. Writer was not well physically at time of observation, otherwise would a more accurate and complete observation would be forthcoming. Think UFO not of natural origin or manufacture from observable information. (see Ex.2), and note prior statement regarding diagrammatic note made for purpose of recollection only and consequent inexactness and inaccuracy of overall contents and detail; look at figures on left side of exhibit, these represent clouds far separated from the UFO, estimated five miles and at estimated altitude four thousand feet; these clouds appeared to be subject to strong winds, possibly of cold Force, the base of each cloud was flat, and the literary term 'scudding' seems an appropriate term to describe same.

Consequently the writer thinks the UFO to be of other than terrestrial origin, a legal act of God. Total count of the individual circular white discs in the object; dimension «B was thought by the writer at time of observation to contain a small enough quantity of the white discs that they could be counted by eye and an attempt was made in relation thereto however the count was lost once or several times, the writer thinks because of the similarity of the discs. At the same time the writer concluded that absolutely no possibility existed for taking a mechanical visual count of the discs nearest dimension «D, so great was the number of circular white discs. The reason the writer goes into detail is, to state his thought in regard to the count of the discs nearest dim. «D, which is, he would not have attempted to count a large quantity of these discs, while at the same time the writer does not wish to leave the impression that the number of discs was so great as to defy all attempts at counting.

occurring in a populated residential area.
Cloud cover: estimated at less than fifteen per cent.
Visibility: clear.
Composition: The UFO appeared to lie on an exact
North-South line or axis. The writer thinks the estimate
herein referred to would not admit of any great variation,
observation vantage point was located on a street known
to be constructed on an East-West compass line or axis.
see Ex. 1; AD appeared to be perpendicular to East-West
compass axis (West wave) at the writer's observation point,
street address 49 West Ave. 14611; AD appeared to be parallel to the above-mentioned known East-West compass-bearing
topographical feature. Has consideration been given in
the making of these estimates as occurring between different planes? Yes.

Regarding overall dimensions of UFO. see Ex. 1. Dimensions: AD estimated at about two miles; from this estimate, and
in conjunction with another estimate, that AD and BD are
approximately five to ten miles long and CD, the writer estimates AD and BD approximately ten miles. Relationship to
known object factor: During the observation period the
writer observed a large commercial aircraft, symbol B on
Ex. 1 which appeared to be in flight, approximately the
same plane as the UFO, which is to say, at the same or similar altitude. This aircraft was in a peculiar position as
observed by the writer, precarious heeled over to starboard
perhaps 45°, on a wing tip so to speak, so that the silhouette
presented was that of an underside view to the writer. The
course appeared to be about 225° right from North 0°. Prior
and subsequent flight of this aircraft unknown and writer's
only recollection is the apparently motionless mind's eye
photograph. Planes in or near the area noted have been frequently observed by the writer and as apparently prepared
for landing procedures at Monroe County airport. The writer
thinks the aircraft may have been farther west than ordinarily seen, and thinks the perspective dimensions of the
aircraft may have been smaller than that of planes in this
landing approach/pattern. Silhouette presented to viewer presented some similarities to former civilian transport and
military aircraft C-47. Estimates given in this paragraph
ought to be subject to qualification as previously noted,
although the writer will make an altitude estimate in this
paragraph which should be qualified as previously noted; another qualification is pertinent, hinging upon the apparent
plane (geometrical) figure of the UFO, which of course would
result in a varying series of altitudes. Certain factors
tend to convince the writer to lean to the plane figure identification, 1) a fairly lengthy period of time of the observation was devoted to attempting to find position flaws of
the white, circular disc-like units of the UFO, in their
relationship to each other, as one might remark the space
on a domino. However no position flaws could be found. Because of the large overall size of the UFO and the probable
thousand of circular discs of which it was constituted, the
writer thinks a non-plane figure would show to the eye a
slight curvature, at least along AD and BD, the remark is
however partly speculative. 3) Perspective indication or the
short legs of the figure (AD and CD) here referring to the
view as seen at the...

Dear Sir:

Enclosure, Exhibits 1 and 2. Ex. 2 consists of a rough diagrammatic note, made several hours after sighting the UFO, and purely for purposes of recalling to mind general outline and location. Exhibit 1 in Ex. 2 is inexact and inaccurate. Exhibit 1 consists of an estimate made in the form of a diagram of the UFO overlaid upon a map of the city of Rochester, N.Y. (Monroe Co.). Note in regard to dimensions, and quantity of the objects, discussed with the object(s) up to the point estimates may vary in excess of plus-or-minus 100% in certain instances; in certain instances may vary to plus-or-minus 100%; and in certain instances were noted can be considered accurate. Because of the overall similarity of the UFO to a plane or solid geometrical figure (rectangle or cube), Ex.1 bears the plans somewhat description and/or a cube figure was not discernible to the viewer, an inference in such regard might obtain from the color (white) and material composition (appeared to consist of ordinary cloud material). Condensed note was not discernible to that some thickness of material would be necessary in order to obtain a nearly deep, solid white color; however the dimension referred to was added, not determined, to the viewer. Note in regard to reference 'rectangle': no line or linear outline appeared and the word rectangle is used to describe a figure the illustration of which is completely composed of the individual units contained therein.

General Description: In early or mid-afternoon of Sept. 23, 1967 the writer observed (see Ex. 1) a figure in the sky. Observation made at 49 West Ave., Rochester, N.Y. 14619, Monroe Co. The white, circular, disc or wafer shaped object was all of same size and shape and the distance between each of objects was exactly the same for mechanical purposes the writer estimates these objects to be 365¼ days (approx.). Correction in regard to Sub. to correction as noted above.

Distance between circular units appeared to be less than the unit diameters, measurement between parallel tangents of adjoining discs.

Length of observation period: not less than five minutes and probably not in excess of twenty minutes. An estimate of fifteen minutes would not be far wrong.

Weather conditions: the day was bright, fair, sunny, and breezy with 10-20 mph and variable direction however wind velocity and direction may be qualified, as a recollection, and as being noted locally (recollected), however wind velocity and direction may be qualified.

30 Dec., 1967

Dear Major,

On Oct. 4 I sent a letter to Bluebook, which was never answered. Whether it ever reached you I do not know, but below is the content of that letter.

Dear Major,

I would like to report an unconventional aerial object which I saw on Saturday, Sept. 30, 1967. It was about 11:00 P.M. (EST), and I was walking with a friend (Albert Pei, Forest Dr. Ithaca, N.Y. 14850). As we were crossing a bridge in Ithaca he pointed out a luminous, yellow point of light moving across the sky at about the speed of an Echo satellite. It was in sight for about one minute during which time it passed behind a tree. At one point I stopped a man who told us that he could not explain it, either. It finally gave the appearance of disintegrating when it dropped three or four dimer yellow spots until it was "used up" and gone. It was about the brilliancy of an airplane's lights at night and didn't change speed or brightness. The outline was like a bright star. It was at a 20 degree elevation and was west of us moving north. It seemed to be about a mile away.

Please do not tell me that I saw an airplane. Airplanes make noise (this object was silent), have red and green blinking lights, not a steady yellow one, and move faster than this did.

It wasn't anything more than a few miles away, either, because there was a very thick cumulus cloud covering over the whole sky.

I don't think it could have been a balloon because the only place I can imagine that would launch one would be an airport. This object was moving towards the local airport, and the UFO moved...

"Doctrine in this record are not related to physical phenomena but are part of a continuing human commitment of belief, a dealing with psychological reality rather than a conversion in dealing with physical reality. Rather the record shows a psychological approach, a matter of his religious belief.

Parenthetical in this matter shows that the writer maintains that he is in an open space, as generally maintaining information on a typewriter, in a room to his address below, particularly this page of a copy of a flow chart. The writer thinks it true, the belief is true, for the way, although of course it may not be true for other persons.

The same sense or by the same token describe the personal relations you make to yourself according to the doctrine stated. In the view that the case as well obtain or become to other persons differently might be true. Paradox belief of doctrine. The personal description is the same as that described to the not very complicated, but still not as well articulated as the typewritten and the writer as a whole.

Clarification slightly increase more the statement, or rather the clarification that a person, or rather a part of the basic terms or belief of this doctrine, in a more words, would constitute a part of research ones, or some political belief. The content of this perception must be a part of the first paragraph, that is basic tenet, doctrine or the writer's activity.

A similar activity, that is to say a religious person motive with a trait of a copy that relates to this point of a matter for relief from persecution, a part of which may be of a method for relief from persecution. A matter of interests or cause for the point of view or because of its affinity. Some side points proceeding, generalizations, etc.

This a Christian, or other religion, generally generally, yes, a decision religion.

Does the writer generally accede to the principles of civil government basically? Yes. He writes in a voice children of the city, or country in the point of view, of New York State, the United States of America, and is an individual member of the Republican political party.

Does the writer subscribe to or constitute an affection of the U.S. government or any political activity? Indirectly by force of fact more generally, no.

Concluded the basic religious tenet, belief, or doctrine of this (city) is well considered. See chart (new political chart) paragraph on page where (be it, etc. cite. Convention 1967).

Last March you answered a letter from me and said, among other things, "Air Force Regulation 200-2 does not prohibit Air Force personnel from releasing details of unexplained UFO reports. The Air Force prohibits the base from issuing premature information on UFO sightings which they cannot solve." Has paragraph 11 been changed? As far as I know it reads,

"Air Force personnel, other than those of the Office of Information Service, will not contact private individuals on UFO cases nor will they..."

Finally, may I have a copy of Bluebook's publication?"

"UFO IN SIGHT - Young science fiction fans Pat Canniff, left, and Tim Kennedy clown around at shooting down an entered picture of the "flying saucer" they launched as a gag

Identified flying object
"Martian" washing machine lid

By BOB SUTTON
A new type of UFO was sighted Saturday near Tecumseh and Lauzon Rds.

The object was photographed by two science-minded boys who made it up to two telephone pole heights, depending on the wind.

Because identity it, you might say, was made up to look convincing, the boys used a washing machine lid.

The sag originated in the home of Tim Kennedy, 135 of St. Louis Ave. and Pat Canniff, 121 of 1125 Edward Ave. - an outgrowth of the Louis School science club.

To make the pictures convincing they created a foggy atmosphere about the base of their aerial saucer with a combination of potassium nitrate and sugar.

The saucer itself was a metal washing machine lid mounted on a bird cage stand.

We told the story without revealing our source, as soon as we showed the pictures were genuine, a few of our friends said, "That was the way Tim would do it."

Tim's pictures were Tim's possibility. He'd converted his home into a sort of hypo chamber more than boy's laboratory with hypo and other chemicals.

They've already done their version of Canada's Alouette satellite communications satellite.

"And we've launched some rockets, too," explained Pat. Altitude record at the moment - "Anywhere from 10 feet up to two telephone pole heights, depending on the wind."

Right now the boys are holding their breaths until they hit high school where the resources of a full-fledged physics and chemistry laboratory will be available. From then on they say's the limit.

For Pat: "I'd like to be either an astronaut and one of the space race for Canada or a physics scientist."

For Tim: "I like photography now but I hope to be a radiological technician."

The article is accompanied by a photograph showing two young men, with a blurry image of what appears to be a flying saucer in the background.

30 Sept 67
5 Oct., 1967

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio 45433

Dear Major,

I would like to report an unconventional aerial object which I saw on Saturday, Sept. 30, 1967. It was about 11:00, (E.S.T.), and I was walking with a friend [redacted], Ithaca, N.Y.14850) As we were crossing a bridge in Ithaca he pointed out a luminous yellow dot of light moving across the sky at about the speed of an Echo satellite. It was in sight for about one minute during which time it passed in back of a tree. At one point I stopped a man who told us that he couldn't explain it either. It finally gave the appearance of disintegrating when it dropped three or four smaller yellow pieces, which burned out before they reached the ground, until it was "used up".

It was about the brilliancy of an airplane's running lights at night and didn't change speed or brightness. The outline was like that of a bright star. It was at about a 20 degree elevation and west of us then moved to the north. It seemed to be about a mile away. There was no exhaust evident.

Please don't tell me that I saw an airplane. Planes make noise (this object was silent) and have red and green blinking lights, not a steady yellow one. It wasn't anything more than a few miles away, either, because there was a very heavy cumulous cloud covering over the whole sky.

I don't think it any kind of balloon because the only place I can imagine that would launch one would be [remainder of text cut off]

airport. This object was moving towards the local airport. There were gusty, shifting winds and the UFO moved steadily. Also, what made it break apart?
I've never seen a UFO before, and I have not reported this to anyone else yet.

Last March you answered a letter from me, and said, among other things, "Air Force regulation does not prohibit Air Force personnel from releasing details of unexplained UFO reports. The Air Force prohibits the base from issuing premature information on UFO sightings which they cannot solve." To the best of my knowledge paragraph 11 reads, "Air Force personnel...will not contact private individuals on UFO cases nor will they discuss...." Was the regulation changed?

Finally, may I have a copy of Blue Book's publication?

Sincerely yours,
