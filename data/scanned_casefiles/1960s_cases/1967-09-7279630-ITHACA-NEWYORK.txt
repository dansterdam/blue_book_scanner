Dear Sir:

The following information is forwarded for your review.

The actual sighting occurred on 21 September 1967, however, it was not possible to obtain the attached infrared photos until 6 February 1968.

The Kemper Brothers, Inc. of Waverly, Ohio were the source photographing specializing in infrared work. The equipment used was a Minive, Autolair 35 Camera. Settings were 1/50 second, ASA 400 Ektachrome film. The filter used was Kodak wratten "A" filter, number 25. He developed the film but is reluctant to release it (1 suspect the quality is marginal). Mr. Fletcher tells me tha: the film is quite dark and he is reluctant to release it to be shown publicly.

Sincerely,

The Strange Case of Police and the UFOs
BY ED KEITH
THERE was a stir in Lowell, Massachusetts, a few days ago when an unidentified flying object was reported hovering over the city according to Lowell police. And this is not the first time such sightings have been reported by the Lowell police, with the result active efforts have been made to investigate any such sightings.
On December 22-23, 1965, five Lowell police officers reported seeing an unidentified object with flashing lights and maneuvering in the sky over Lowell. They pursued the object in their police cars, but lost it.
On March 25, 1967, another Lowell police officer reported sighting what appeared to be a "flying saucer" in the sky over Lowell. He said the object was bright, yellow, and round like a disk with a star-like light in the center, and that it hovered over the city for a short time before zooming out of sight.
Now a similar incident has been reported to me. The early morning of September 7, 1967, found Lowell police officers again in pursuit of an unidentified flying object. This time it was Officer Arthur Black who told me about it.
"It was around 1:15 a.m. when I was cruising alone in my police car," Officer Black said. "I happened to see this extremely bright, glowing object up in the sky. At first I thought it might be a star, but soon realized it was much closer and moving.
"I watched it for a few minutes, then decided I'd better notify headquarters and see if any other officers had spotted it. I called in and was told that the dispatcher and other men on duty had also seen the object and were puzzled by it.
"By that time, I had driven to an area on the outskirts of Lowell and the object seemed to be hovering over that section of the city. I waited there a few minutes, then decided to try to get closer to it. As I drove toward it, the object began to move away, but not too fast. I followed it for about a mile, keeping it in sight all the time.
"Suddenly, it seemed to make an abrupt turn and started moving very rapidly. I tried to follow it, but it quickly disappeared from view. I have no idea what kind of aircraft or object it was, but I know it was no ordinary plane or helicopter."
Officer Black said that after he lost sight of the object, he returned to headquarters and filed a report. He said the dispatcher and other officers on duty that night also saw the object and were just as puzzled by it as he was.
Lowell Police Chief Ardy Black, to whom I spoke later, confirmed Officer Black's report. He said that several of his men had seen the unidentified object that night and that efforts were being made to try to determine what it was. The chief said his men were definitely convinced they had seen something "extraordinary" in the sky that was not a conventional aircraft.
So the Lowell police have had their brush with UFOs. And if the past is any indication, they may well have more of such encounters in the future. For it seems that wherever police are on the lookout for UFOs, sooner or later they spot them.

The page appears to be part of a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes the writer's preparation of an IPSO FACTO, a statement of religious doctrine, in connection with the New York state Constitutional Convention. The text also mentions a report of a sighting of a UFO on September 23, 1967 in Rochester, New York.

Text extracted from the document:

2nd OF REPORT OF SIGHTINGS OF UFO OF SEP'T 23, 1967, Rochester,
New York (Monroe Cy)

Notes: The writer at about this time was preparing, and filed
IPSO FACTO, a statement of religious doctrine with the New
York state Constitutional Convention. Consideration of the appearance of the UFO and the filing of the religious statement
indicates to the writer a clam of approval or authorization
by God to the religious case, despite the apparent antagonism
between the article to publish and the official face, etc. this is a direct statement which
cannot be substantiated, but in logic no subjective or internal knowledge obtains to the remarks made in the note.

UFO Observation September 30, 1967

2. Syracuse, N.Y. 13057
1. This replies to your letter of December 30, 1967 in which you requested information on your unidentified observation of September 30, 1967.

2. The description that you provided on your observation is consistent with other reports that we have received of plastic segments glowing object that is red, orange, yellow or white in color, and usually uses brightness candles for a heat source. After the candles burn down, the stage or platform on which the candles are mounted can be seen falling from the object. Shortly after the fiery pieces fall the light dims and disappears.

3. We have requested that our analysts date the data from your observation for September 30, 1967.

4. If the object that you saw was going in the direction of the surface winds is seems very likely that it was indeed a hot air balloon that you observed.

4. Included is an extract from AFR 80-17 regarding dissemination of information to the public. (Section B, AFR 80-17)

5. We hope that the enclosed plus took brochure will be both interesting and informative. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, likely describing the visual observations and analysis of a reported UFO sighting.

OCRED TEXT:

Count illustrates in Ex. 1 is probably too small...the writer seems to feel the object or objects observed made to take a visual count (of the objects nearest dim. "3") and size the half his field of view at nine seen. In other words the count of the objects suggests dim. "3" but the siste of 9 seen. "In conclusion, the total dimensions on length of dimension "d" the writer made a mechanical estimate, approximately 3 by 10 feet. This might vary possibly from three times the length of the short dimension as the writer has not quite certain. The point of the dimensions of the object noted by the observer, which is the distance nearest the observer, is approximately 800 yards. The angular distance which the object subtends the observer, is approximately the size of a dime held at the mentioned distance at which a dime is the distance nearest. The writer can first state he thinks the two dimensions are really approximately square, and the object actually composed of circular white discs.

Perspective View Overall From Observer's Vantage Point: An illustration made for this reader's mind's eye or illustrative initial views are not for purposes of dimensions to conclusions but these views should serve the general impression of the figure as actually composed of circular white discs.

- page 13 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly a report, that describes observations of a rectangular object or objects in the sky.

The text in the document states:

Indicates to this observer the existence of a plane, rectangular figures for instance, dimension as appeared to equal several feet in length and width, while passing down to several hundred yards, giving a full view when one observed the object, usual height of rectangulars circles, then distances which make up the object. The writer did not at the time of observation make a comprehensive measurement, data related thereto is from recollection. So that, as it may, and with the understanding of the same time, the recollection may be active or less near the actual facts than that of the writer.

The following estimated size of the object is given: perhaps at an altitude of several hundred feet, perhaps five hundred feet, and of course, respectively one inch in diameter, near symbol c, the UFO unit nearest thereto, at an altitude in feet, of dimensions as common visualization hundreds of feet, that the object apparently was less near, several sixteenths of an inch, perhaps three or four sixteenths of an inch.

The text further discusses the estimated size and distance of the object, stating that it was observed at an altitude of several thousands of feet, estimated twenty-two fourths of an inch, possibly six-eighths of an inch. The writer states they do not know how it terminated.

The document then discusses the writer's observations and inability to make precise measurements, as well as their belief that the object was of terrestrial origin rather than extraterrestrial.

The writer thinks a non-plane fixture would fly to the eye and however, partly speculative. 3) Far selective vision of the short term nature observation or no other details came to the writer's observation.

Dear Sir:
Enclosure. Exhibits 1 and 2. Ex. 2 consists of a rough diagrammatic notes, made several hours after sighting the UFO. and Exhibit 1 contains general outline sketches made on the same day at the site. 
As mentioned in the letter, their recollections may be inaccurate. Exhibit 1 consists of an estimate made in the form of sketches by M.Y. (Monroe Co.). Notes in regard to dimensions, and quantity of the object's similarity of construction may vary in excess of plus-or-minus 100% in certain instances.
The estimates in Exhibit 2 were not made until several days later, and therefore, accuracy may be questioned because of the overall similarity of the UFO to a plane or solid geometric description as described on the plans geometry description said "a cube figure was not discernible to color (white) and visual composition (as?) recanted to consist of primary color struction composite/solid (e.g.) not a gray or solid color (white) was viewed ail the way round.)
Since the World reference is used to describe a figure obtained, it was not desirable to obtain a nearly deep solid white colors: however, the dimension reported are not discernible, so the viewer-1959 in regard to reference a triangle no line or linear outline appeared upon the skyline of the illustration which is considered be completely spaced of the individual unite-

General Description: In early or mid-afternoon of Sept. 23, 1957, the observation made at 49 feet above. Rochester, N.Y. 14619. where a. single circular white object appeared to be less than the unit diameter, centered between parallel lines and probably not in excess of twenty minutes.
Weather conditions: the day was bright, fair, sunny, and approximately 20 + miles visibility. However, the (Record ?) indicated that the comparison of sky conditions was fair, but almost identical monthly in regard to that date distribution and cloud formations.
Location may be questionable, and location may be of a different nature.

At first, she thought it was an aircraft, but it soon became apparent that it was not an airplane or any conventional aircraft. The light appeared to be hovering and did not seem to be moving. It remained in view for approximately 15-20 minutes before suddenly disappearing. There were no other witnesses to this sighting. 
Bess is a reliable witness and her report appears to be sincere. The report is considered to be genuine and is forwarded for any evaluation or investigation that may be deemed appropriate.

STATEMENT OF CASE:  
The following sightings were reported and investigated by the Ithaca Police Department, Ithaca, New York:

At approximately 2030 hrs. on 7 September 1967, an unidentified flying object was observed by several persons in the Ithaca, New York area. The object was described as a bright, brilliant, pear-shaped object which appeared to be hovering over the city. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes and then appeared to accelerate and fly out of sight to the northwest. Several separate calls were received by the Ithaca Police Department from various citizens reporting the sighting.

The Ithaca Police immediately notified the Air Defense Command of the sighting, and two F-106 aircraft were scrambled from the Syracuse, New York Air Force Base to investigate the sighting. The aircraft were on station within 15 minutes, but were unable to locate the object. 

The object was also observed by personnel of the Ithaca College Observatory and its movement and flight path was plotted. The observatory personnel described the object as a brilliant, pear-shaped object which hovered and then accelerated out of sight to the northwest.

Dear Major,

On Oct. 4 I sent a letter to Bluebook, which was never answered. Whether it ever reached you I do not know, but below is the content of that letter.

Dear Major,

I would like to report an unconventional aerial object which I saw on Saturday, Sept. 30, 1967. It was about 11:05 P.M. (EDT), and I was walking with a friend (Albert Pel, Forest Dr., Ithaca, N.Y. 14850), as we were crossing a bridge in Ithaca. The object pointed out a luminous yellow point of light moving across the sky at about the speed of an Echo satellite. It was in sight for about one minute during which time it passed a bright point of light which, I stopped a man who told us that he could not explain it, either. It finally gave the appearance of diminishing when it seemed three or four dimmer yellow spots until it was "used up" and gone.

It was about the brilliancy of an airplane's lights at night and didn't change of brightness. The outline was like a bright star. It was at a 20 degree elevation and was west of us moving north. It seemed to be about a mile away.

Please do not tell me that I saw an airplane. Airplanes make noise (this object was silent), have red and green blinking lights, not a steady yellow one, and move faster than this did.

It wasn't anything more than a few miles away, either, because there was a very thick overcast cloud covering over the whole sky.

I don't think it could have been a balloon because the only place I can imagine that would launch one would be an airport. This object was moving towards the local air- port. This observation seems to indicate that the UFO observed

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
SUBJECT: Observation of Unidentified Flying Object
DATE: September 7, 1967
LOCATION: Ithaca, New York
WITNESS: Redacted
On September 7, 1967, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the witness reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Ithaca, New York. The witness stated that the object was first observed moving in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object then made a sudden stop and hovered in the sky for several minutes. The witness described the object as being round or disc-shaped, with a bright light emanating from the center. The object then began to move again, this time in a southerly direction, and disappeared from view.

The witness reported the incident to the County Clerk's Office, Monroe County, New York, and the case was referred to Project Blue Book for further investigation.

This appears to be a standard report of an unidentified flying object sighting, as part of the official Project Blue Book investigations. The report provides details of the witness's observation, including the location, time, and description of the object. The report also indicates that the case was referred to Project Blue Book for further investigation.

"(12 CIVIL CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, 1967)

RESOLVED, That this Convention make room for protection to all religious sects and denominations, and allow no inequality among them, and to all others who shall demean themselves peaceably as good citizens, and that the clergy of the several religious denominations throughout the State shall be eligible to seats in the Convention.

Any person of proper faith, sect, or group belong to a religious organization, and in common with theological doctrine and moral requirements of the membership thereof said persons shall be, and are hereby, declared to be eligible.

ANY MEMBERSHIP LIMITATIONS as to women, children, owners? No.

Beyond that certain or unusual groupies), thisway of living?, of community, organization or denomination shall not be abridged on ground of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

Is the South any particular or peculiar to the result of unconstitutional conditions, national in character, of a distinctly separate nature as compared to the North - as far as the circumstances of life and property rights, and the facilities for education and training for the young and the aged poor and infirm are concerned? Conditions in the states are so different and the causes so varied, that a general system applicable to all is impracticable.

You state in the first paragraph & list that the actual human beings in the group or sect have no limitation as to women, children, owners? No. 

Beyond the text there is no further description or context. The document appears to be discussing issues of religious freedom, membership, and treatment of different groups, but without more context it's difficult to say definitively what the full scope and purpose of this document is.

The Directed Flying Object
By Ron Sutton
They've already done their communication saucer-type machines
which are now being built in some companies, and there is now machine that can be
controlled from a distance, but it appears to be a flying saucer of some type. There
have been a number of reports of these things that have been investigated, and so far
no one has been able to identify them. Some people think they're from another planet or
from another dimension. 
A flying object was observed at shooting down an enlarged picture which appeared to
be sort of a saucer-shaped affair. I won't say it definitely was a flying saucer, but at
the same time I can't identify what it was. It was definitely an unidentified flying object.
This occurred at Speeding down, and Lansing Road. The object was moving across the
field in a horizontal direction. It was sharply lighted, and seemed to be metallic. Smoke
was trailing. It flashed on and off. The duration was about 10 seconds.

Dear Mrs. Striamtiner, 

I wish to report a sighting I have observed during the past weekend. On Saturday night, September 2, 1967, at approximately 10:00 p.m. EDT, I was outside in my backyard on Dryden Road, Ithaca, New York, and observed a large, bright, circular object in the sky. It was moving at a high rate of speed and changing in shape, color and size. It was white in color and appeared to emit pulsating lights that changed from white to red and blue. The object was observed for approximately one minute before it disappeared from view. I know that what I observed was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I would be willing to discuss this further if desired. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio 45433

Dear Major,

I would like to report an unconventional aerial object which I saw on Saturday, Sept. 30, 1967. It was about 11:00 a.m. I was walking with a friend on a bridge in Ithaca, N.Y.(14850) As we were crossing a bridge in Ithaca, he pointed out a luminous yellow dot of light moving across the sky at about the speed of an echo satellite. It was in sight for about one minute during which time it passed in front of a tree. At one point I stopped a man who told us that he couldn't explain it either. It finally gave the appearance of disintegrating when it dropped three or four smaller yellow pieces, which burned out before they reached the ground, until it was "used up".

It was about the brilliancy of an airplane's running lights at night and didn't change speed or brightness. The outline was like that of a bright star. It was at about a 20 degree elevation and west of us then moved to the north. It seemed to be about a mile away. There was no exhaust evidence.

Please don't tell me that I saw an airplane. Planes make noise (this object was silent) and have red and green blinking lights. It wasn't anything more than a few miles away, either, because there was a very hazy curious cloud covering over the whole sky.

I don't think it any kind of balloon because the only place I can imagine that would launch one would be the Cornell University campus, and there was no wind or disturbance that I could see or feel. I hope you can give me some idea of what I saw.

Sincerely,
E. Syracuse, N.Y. 13205

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. The document appears to be a letter discussing a UFO sighting and regulations regarding UFO reports.

The text of the document is as follows:

airport. This object was moving towards the local air-port. There were gusty, shifting winds and the UFO moved erratically. Also, what made it break up partly.

I've never seen a UFO before, and I have not reported this to anyone else yet.

Last March you answered a letter from me, and said, among other things, "Air Force regulation does not prohibit Air Force personnel from releasing details of unex- plained UPC reports. The air force prohibits the base from issuing premature information on UFO sightings which they cannot solve." To the best of my knowledge paragraph ll reads, "Air Force personnel...will not contact private individuals on UFO cases nor will they discuss..." Was the regulation changed?

Finally, may I have a copy of Blue Book's publication?

Sincerely yours,
