mente seis meses, que mi aconte-
cio revisar, era buen dia claro
y brillante, un bonito cielo qual
de mi ocurrio mirar por mi situan-
do el firmamento, y a una
distancia considerable pude
ver un objeto en el espacio
que formaba una estrella muy
grande de color platino brillante,
de la misma figura una cola

o solia, y al final tenia una
boleta roja, que a gran distancia
se podia notar, me sente para
observarlas y la seguia con
mi bisto, y segui subiendo a
gran altura hasta que ze me
perdio de vista, ns habian nubes
el cielo era claro y brillante.

Le remito este informacion para
su estudio y entenderecioin.

Lo otro lo mi sugerencia, como
nuestro gov. puede aldaarse, milome
de dolar, que los mismos podrian
ser sitios y ara fortificar y
juzgar su base y territorios, es
suspendiendo el alomento a los
familiares de los soldados en el
ejercicio en tiempo de paz, esto
le baria porque quien corazon
adultos a esa gran nacion, y
conste que mis lapsos es retirads.
con treinta y tres anos de servicio.

Respetuosamente

Sirs:

I take pleasure in sending you some information I believe will be of great help to you, as well as a suggestion.

Approximately six months ago I was lying down, resting - on a clear and sunny day with a beautiful blue sky - when I looked through the window and saw, in the sky, at a considerable distance, an object in space, of the shape of a very large star. It had a brilliant platinum color. From it was suspended a tail or track and at the end it had a red ticket [? - "boleta"] which could be noted at a great distance.

I sat up to observe it and followed it with my eyes. It continued to rise to a high altitude until it was lost from sight. There were no clouds. The sky was clear and brilliant. I am sending you this information for your study and consideration.

The suggestion I want to make pertains to how your government can save millions of dollars which could be used to fortify and prepare your bases and territories. It could suspend the allotments paid to the relatives of soldiers in service in time of peace. I am doing this because I love your great country deeply and I would like to say that my husband is retired, with thirty-three years of service.

Respectfully yours,
[signed]
