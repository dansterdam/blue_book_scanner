I checked the area completely for other aircraft. I could not get the aircraft more than 100 ft above ground as I know the terrain very well, and there is a hill where it appeared to be.

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968

MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE                                                25 JULY 1967

Another single witness case. The present "possible aircraft" evaluation is not in line with the report unless we say the report is grossly in error.

Report does not indicate tangential motion. He described appearance as bright red. There was no sound, but object was in sight only 1Â½ minutes. His "A" and "B" on page 5 of his report are identical and not moving--except away from observer.

A detailed follow-up would have been needed to properly evaluate this sighting. So---"possible aircraft" is possible unidentified.

Re: Manchester, N.H. Case, 25/JS/67)

Another simple "possible" excerpt
of the present "probable" case. Elevation is not in clear
such the report renders us say the
report is going in error.

Report does not wish 28 describe
carefully as bright sat. 25 clear
appearance as bright sat. was
was no scene but 1 1/2 mile. His "A"
and "B" of 6 of the report are very
identical. Never. Follow up
would have been made to this repository.
properly exclusive to "possible" among
so - "possible" except "possible" tips.

31.   10 July 1967, Azalea, Mississippi.
       See attached supplemental sheet B.

32.   11 July 1967, Macon, Georgia.
       Temporarily misplaced. Check to see whether this has any relation
       to the sighting the previous day in Azalea, Mississippi.

33.   25 July 1967, Manchester, New Hampshire
       The only Manchester, New Hampshire case I have is for a different
       date.

34.   12 October 1967, Ocaloosa County, Florida.
       Although this had four witnesses, the data are very poor. A
       balloon is r led out because of wind at all levels. Two objects,
       one trailing the other, nighttime observation, went from the northern
       to the southern horizon in three minutes. Anyone of three evaluations:
       (1) insufficient data (2) probable aircraft (3) possible unknown.

35.   31 October 1967, Denver, Colorado.
       Do not have in my files. Will do in Dayton.

TETE/UFO (Maj Quintanilla)/70916/mbn/25 Sep 67)
Manchester, New Hampshire, 25 July 1967 Sighting

Manchester Municipal Airport
Manchester, New Hampshire 03100

1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch is investigating an unidentified
Flying object (UFO) report. The observation occurred in your
area on 25 July 1967 between 1115 and 1130 pm. The observer
described the unidentified flying object as a red cylindrical
object with whitish headlights. The object disappeared to the
east of Manchester. The sighting may have been of an aircraft,
the red glow being the jet exhaust, and the "whitish headlights"
the landing lights. Information on any aircraft departing or
arriving at your airfield that may have been the stimulus for
this sighting would be helpful. If someone in the control tower
saw a similar object (identified or unidentified) we would be
interested in their comments.

2. Thank you for any assistance you can provide on this
25 July 1967 unidentified observation.
