The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. It shows what seems to be a tower or pole with some wires or cables leading from it to the ground. The text below the drawing mentions "gay wires from the tower to the ground" and speculates that "the slide out to the right might have been that it was landing, probably larger and brighter than the rest lights at the tower".

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 July 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire:
AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE WITH LANDING GEAR THAT WAS DESCENDING RAPIDLY FOR LANDING WHEN IT CIRCLED THE OBJECT WITH JUST NORMAL CAREENING LIGHTS ON IT. WHEN IT LANDED WE THOUGHT IT COULD BE A CENTAUR OR SOME OTHER SPACE VEHICLE. ALSO, I DO NOT KNOW IF IT MIGHT HAVE MADE SUCH A TIGHT LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND THE TRANSMITTING TOWER. IT FELL LIKE THIS:

There are 'gay wires' from the tower to the ground. I think the 'slide out to the right' might have been that it was landing, probably larger and brighter than the rest lights at the tower.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As soon as it went down behind the trees, we got into my car and drove over to the tower. We could find no sign of it after that, although we watched for it for quite a while. It was dark, so we couldn't see it very well without lights. For we were hardly out of sight of the tower, where we were trying to drive out to. The light seemed to possess the same puzzles as before. When they are in the air I usually hear them before I see them. They are several lake control flights in the Bloomington area. I have carried on a private investigation, making frequent trips to the airport. That was perhaps a month ago. This wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a table or report from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. The table has columns for "PROJ", "SOUNDING DATE", "LOCATION", "DIRECTION", "RE-MARK" and various numerical values, likely related to data collected from UFO sightings or investigations.

The image contains a sketch diagram with various markings and labels, as well as a compass-like symbol, but there is no photograph present.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text below the sketch appears to be describing the instructions for this project rather than transcribing any text from the document itself.
