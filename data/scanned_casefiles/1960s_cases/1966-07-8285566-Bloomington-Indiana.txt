4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: N/A

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Other(plasma)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers noted star-like object that made a very large circle then a smaller circle around a radio tower. Then slowly fell like a leaf, in a rocking motion, down some trees. The object was pulsating, changing color, sometimes red and green lights were visible.

Dr. Rynck talked with one of the observers and now the radio tower six times and taking about five seconds for each trip around.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   29   July   1966
                                                    Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

At first we thought it was an airplane with landing & running lights on, circling the city in preparation for a landing. When it circled the apartments with no sound we got up. When it wandered what I saw was and I carefully attention to it. When it landed we thought it could be a helicopter, yet they are usually so noisy we decided against that possibility. Also, I do not know of a conventional aircraft that could make such a tight little circle around the transmitting tower.

It felt like this: [hand-drawn sketch of a transmitting tower with a small object near it]

There are guy wires from the tower to the ground. I think the slide out to the right might have been that it was trying to avoid them. The lights now much larger and brighter than the red lights on the tower.

As soon as it went down behind the trees we got into my car and drove over to the tower. We could find no sign of it. Possibly it took off again while we were on the way to the tower. If it did it must have gone very fast or without lights, for we were hardly out of sight of the tower during the few minutes it took to drive over there.

The lack of sound puzzles me. When there are planes in the air I usually hear them before I see them. There are several Lake Central flights into Bloomington and I see those planes frequently, along with small private planes and a helicopter. I make frequent trips to New York via Kennedy Airport and see many planes and the helicopter that goes to JFK. No building. This wasn't like any of those in its movements or lack of sound.

It was difficult to determine the shape because the light was so bright.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

It made a very large circle, then a smaller one around a very prominent complex, then a very tight circle around the radio tower, then slowly fell like a leaf. A rock my moving around a few trees. After it landed we jumped in my car and drove to the tower, hovered, and in the 20-3 minutes it took to get there.
