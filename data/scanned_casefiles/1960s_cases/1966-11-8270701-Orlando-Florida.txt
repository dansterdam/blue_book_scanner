PROJECT 12273 RECORD
1. DATE, TIME GROUP: 15 NOV 63/1930Z
2. LOCATION: ORLANDO, FLA.
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: ONE
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: SEVERAL MINUTES
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND VISUAL
7. COURSE: VARIED
8. PHOTOS: NO
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO
10. CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT (PROBABLE)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1930Z OVER THE ORLANDO, FLA., AREA. IT WAS FIRST OBSERVED IN AN ELLIPTICAL PATH AT A HIGH ALTITUDE, THEN DESCENDED RAPIDLY AND LEVELED OFF NEAR THE HORIZON. IT WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A BRIGHT COLOR, POSSIBLY RED, AND FLASHING LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGES. AFTER LEVELING OFF IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN MOVED ERRATICALLY AT A RAPID SPEED BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THREE DIFFERENT OBSERVERS REPORTED THIS SIGHTING WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. DUE TO THE ERRATIC MOVEMENT AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFY IT AS A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS CONSIDERED THE PROBABLE EXPLANATION.

Project Blue Book
Special report of sighting: Vision of the Air Force system
November

To whom it may concern:

The below is a statement: I will swear to as a UFO observer. On November 2, 1966, at 7:32 PM EST, I was prompted to make my report on an aerial vision. 

It was Friday, November 4, 1966, at 7:32 PM EST, 2 orange glowing objects traveling north about 5000 feet in altitude of planes circling for landing at an nearby airport. The objects appeared to be moving rather slowly and alternating patterns. It was moving rather slowly and hovering in a stationary position. I remarked on the grasping of the good year blimp and imagined it was about the same size. when we slowed down to a stop, the objects then started to accelerate at a high rate of speed and in a short time went out of sight. They appeared to be under intelligent control. I suggest that we have far more to learn about this type of visual contact around 3:15 AM, I suggested to a crew on colonial Drive. We were driving west on Colonial Drive. We were stopped at a traffic light, and it appeared to be stationary, then moved off, then it appeared to be stationary again. I suggest further study of this type of incident.

the object was,as we came up on the overhead,beenrise up on the glass-covered-part of the green-lighted gas-station-be sign. in front of us lit up like a full moon and most of the lights seem to come from the rear and most of the other lights seemed to come from the rear and rest appeared to come from the front. it was brighter than any headlights and was hovering above the road about 30 to 40 feet at an altitude of about 100 feet. it appeared to have some kind of dome or something on top of it as it was lighted all around. there was no sound whatever. it hovered there for a minute or so. the object moved very slowly and silently. then it was just a little larger than a basketball. it returned to its original position and then made a very very quick movement and shot straight up and disappeared. it was brighter than any car headlights and most of the lights seemed to come from the rear and rest appeared to come from the front. it was very brightly lighted all around and that is what confuses and bewildered me. they told us a power failure report. it was no airplane, no balloon, no helicopter, nor plane. it is something which I have never seen and I have watched rockets cover up some. explanation of observation would like to learn at. if don't know, say so.

A statement can be obtained from Mrs. [redacted] if you care.

I would like a reply if it is at all possible.

I swear this statement is the truth and that I am not on city or service. the object was clearly visible and the altitude and movements. appears to be unlike anything being done now. 

Yours truly,
Mrs. [redacted]
