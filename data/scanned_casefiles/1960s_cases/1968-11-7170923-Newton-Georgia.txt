11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness encountered brilliant light directly above road as he rounded a bend in road in sparsely settled territory. About 200 feet ahead of him and 50-75 feet off the ground. No object, just light. Radio faded into static. Light itself emitted a beam downward that illuminated nearby trees. Light was retracted as if the beam were a ladder. Beam 5 - 6 feet wide, well defined. Main light fuzzy on edges. Driving a '67 Ford, but engine just cut out as did radio. Main light was scintillating. Subtended arc of several degrees. Light disappeared in a few seconds, going straight up. Engine started by itself - car had been left in drive gear.

2 was travelling East on Hwy 91 11.7 miles west of Newton, Ga. at approx 8:05

On I crossed Mockaway Creek my radio (LUCKY Exploring) was clouded with static, I stopped a sec and started into a curve when I saw a very large bright light 40-50 yds. in diameter yellow-white in color about 100 feet in front of my car 50-75 ft off the ground. A beam of light came from the main body of light striking the hood of my car at this point the engine stopped and the lights, radio & heater cut off. I braced the car and stopped. I watched the object for 2-3 minutes then it charged to a brighter reddish-orange color and proceeded upward at a very high speed in less than 15 seconds it had gone completely out of sight straight up. I then noticed my car was unresponsive (it was still on drive gear) the engine was dying and lights, radio, heater were functioning as if they had never stopped. I drew very slowly to the county and made a report at the attempt to report this in Newton and receiving no cooperation from Baker County Sheriff.

NEAR NEWTON, GEORGIA

November 23, 1968

This sighting was investigated and evaluated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Air Force scientific consultant on UFOs. The following represents a brief summary of his analysis and conclusions regarding this sighting:

Witness saw a brilliant light directly above the road about 200 feet ahead of him and 50 to 75 feet off the ground as he rounded a bend in the road in his 1967 Ford. The area was sparsely settled. There was no definite object, just light. The car radio faded into static. The light itself dimmed a beam downward that illuminated nearby trees.

Light then was retracted as if the beam were a ladder; it was five to six feet wide, and well defined. The main light was fuzzy on the edges. Now the engine cut out as did the radio. Main light appeared scintillating with a subtended arc of several degrees.

Light then disappeared after a few seconds, going straight up. Engine started by itself, and car had been left in drive gear.

CONCLUSION: Unidentified

TRANSCRIPT OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN Hynek and [redacted]

H: Hello, Mr. [redacted]

J: Yes sir.

H: Hi, this is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.

J: How are you, Dr. Hynek?

H: Fine. I didn't call earlier because I was detained. I'm very happy to have your letter which I got just today as a matter of fact (yes sir) and just in time to make the call. Your case there is a very interesting one and I would like to get more details. I have the report here, as it came from Moody Air Force Base and it's a very sketchy report. Let me tell you briefly what it says, and then you can probably fill me in.

Description of object: Oblong shape; Length: 40 or 50 yards; white, resembled a rounded football on its side. As UFO approached vehicle engine died and all electrical equipment failed. A beam of light was emitted from object. Loud static on auto radio tuned to a station that normally comes in clear. Object departed straight up at high rate of speed. Went completely out of sight in 15 seconds. And, essentially, that's about all. What I'd like to ask, if you are agreeable, to just sort of back, take a deep breath and, in your own words, just give me a narrative account filling in the details that certainly the report doesn't have. Can you do that now?

J: Yes, I'd be glad to. (Fine) Col. Cadue(?), I believe, that came up and he had one of the standard forms that he wanted filled out. It was just a questionnaire form and I just answered the questions to the best of my ability.

H: Well, those questionnaires are certainly helpful in many respects, but I find that in my own work with the UFO problem that I like to start with just the narrative account of what happened. What a person was and what


- page 14 -

he saw and that sort of thing, and then, after you do that, I would like
to ask a few questions.

J Okay, sir, I'd be glad to.

H By the way, to save me the trouble of making a lot of pencil notes, do
you have any objection if I put on my own little tape recorder just for
my own purposes only.

J No sir, not at all.

H Okay. All right, shoot.

J Well, I work as an outside collector, an accounts adjustor, and I was
on my way home on a Friday evening at approximately 8 o'clock I made
my last call and this is how I'm familiar with the time. I was proceeding
east on Highway 91, which was later determined to be 11.7 miles west of
Newton, Georgia.

H What was the night like? the weather?

J The weather was very clear, there were many bright stars out.

H Was there any moonlight?

J Yes, there was some, but I couldn't tell you the position of the moon, to
save my life.

H I can look that up.

J I crossed Notch-away Creek, just a local creek down here, I crossed the
bridge on this creek and started into a sharp curve which curved to the
left and topped a little hill. As I topped the hill and started into the
curve I saw this light. I didn't see it come down or fly sideways, or
anything, but I just saw it sitting above the road. At the time I first
sighted it it was maybe 150 to 200 feet in front of the car.

H Was it at that time, estimating distances is always difficult, did it at


- page 15 -

Here is the text from the document:

anytime come in front of anything?
J No sir, it didn't. It was always over the middle of the road, possibly 50-75 feet off the ground...
H You had to look then, did you have to look through the top part of your windshield or middle or how?
J Well, it was towards the upper portion of the windshield.
H So you were looking up and the object was against the sky then.
J Right, yes. .
H Okay, when you say it was white, was it a uniform white, or was it fuzzy at the edges, or what?
J It was sort of a yellowish-white, I guess similar to the sun on a bright day; the outer edges seemed to have a fuzzy texture to them, it was nothing that was very clear cut and defined.
H Now, was the...did you at any time see an object connected with it or was it always just a light.
J It was always just a very large light. I never could see any metallic surface or definite characteristics ...
H Yes, this occurs, your report as strange and unusual as it is, is by no means . . . doesn't stand by itself; there have been many other cases like it reported, and I'm, of course, in my own work searching for patterns between various cases. Okay, please go ahead.
J Well, the first thing that I noticed was before I actually sighted the light, was the fact that my radio, WCKY in Cincinnati completely faded into static, which is very unusual because I can usually pick it up very clearly at night. But before I had tried to adjust my radio to may be find a station again I saw this light, and I first noticed the light there


- page 16 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

seemed to be a beam that came from the lower middle portion of the light down to the car; the beam was of a whiter nature,xta if you know what I mean.

H Did it appear as though the beam was directed at the car?

J That was the impression that I got. Now, here again, I was, I guess, so frightened that it's hard to distinguish exactly what was happening, but this is the impression that I got, that the beam was shined down to the car.

H Now, at the time, were there any other cars on the road?

J No sir, there was not. This, too, is something that is kind of interesting because I've been by that particular place several times since and there's always a car either in sight behind me or in front of me, but on this particular night there was none.

H Let me ask you about the brightness. How would you compare it, to say, a street light a block away, or how close would you have to hold a flash-light to your eyes to have it appear the same brightness?

J Well, now the brightness is kind of very interesting in that it lit up the road and the ditches and, you know, the trees on the sideft the road, yet I could look directly at it and it didn't hurt my eyes.

H I see.

J It was light enough to light up the area, but yet it was not bright enough to be harmful to my eyesight.

H Was that, was the beam that was projected from it, brighter or dimmer than the main body?

J The beam, I don't know, it was kind of strange; I wasn't actually looking directly into the beam. The beam seemed to be coming a little below my


- page 17 -

vision, if you know what I mean. It was more or less shining at the front or maybe hood portion of my car rather than in the window itself.

H I see. How narrow or how wide would you say the beam was?

J Approximately 5 to 6 feet, the width of the car.

H And were the edges of the beam sharp or fuzzy? [Illegible text]

J There were very defined, just similar to a flashlight or spotlight beam.

H I see, that is certainly interesting. Well, okay, please (I keep interrupting) but please go ahead with your story.

J Well, at the time, this beam seemed to reach down and touch my car, the engine failed and this was noted first by the oil light indicator coming on inside the car, or the generator light and I mashed the accelerator and the car did not respond at all and so I put on the brakes. I found stopping and steering the car very difficult, the car having power steering and power brakes.

H What model car is it, by the way?

J '67 Ford custom.

H So you, it is not a car you'd not expect to have difficulties with, I should imagine.

J No sir, I'd never had any similar difficulties like this before.

H Now, I'm interested in this mechanism we have that, I would say, well over a hundred cases of engine stoppage. I'm trying to track down just the manner in which it. . . is it sudden, does it sputter, does it slowly die or what?

J It seemed to just cut off, as if I had possibly turned it off myself, but I'll explain later why I don't feel that I turned it off myself.

When the engine died I stopped the car with the brake, which was, like I


- page 18 -

said, difficult by the power brakes, the power steering not being functionally. The impression that I got was that the outside beam, you know, the headlight, went out too, but under this situation, looking back, i don't know how I knew this. If the road was lit up, I don't know how I knew that my lights went out, but in the preliminary report I stated the lights did go out and radio did completely cut off.

H That you are certain of, that the radio did actually, completely cut out.

J Yes. After I stopped the car, I didn't make any motion to get out of the car and leave. I guess I was just frozen from fight, and it was a most harrowing experience. I sat there and observed no change in the light for approximately two to three minutes; this is just a wild guess, just an estimate.

H It was still, you estimate, what did you say, 50 or 75 feet above the road?

J Yes, and approximately the same distance in front of the car at the time I was stopped.

H So that you would have been looking up then, at about a 45 degree angle.

J Yes, I was actually leaning forward a little bit to look up at it. And after sitting there, for approximately two or three minutes, the object changed color and the beam visibly receded, slowly back up into the main body of light.

H You mean, you could see the bottom, I don't want to put words in your mouth here.

J It seemed like, yes, sort of like withdrawing a gangplank or something, It seemed like that you could actually see the bottom of the light, the end of the beam itself, going back up into the main body of light.


- page 19 -

Here is the text from the document:

H Now this has been, this also has been reported. Let me ask you, I don't 
mean to get personal, but how much on UFO's have you read in the past?

J Very little. I'd never been interested in them much, I never believed 
in them, to be honest with you. I had never . . .

H The reason I asked you, is that if a person had read books quite a bit 
he would be familiar with the, this retraction of the light. This does 
occur, it's something that is most difficult for our physics to understand, 
because we can't conceive of any way in which a light beam can be retracted 
like a ladder, and yet this has appeared, occurred many time, or reported 
to have occurred many times. Well now, I'm very much interested in the 
details, any details you can give me of whether the light pulsating, changing 
intensity, was it moving, was it completely steady, or what?

J Well, there didn't seem to be any pulsating light from where I was standing, 
I mean, you know, where I was sitting there in the car. It seemed to be 
just a constant, I don't know how to say it, it seemed to be a rolling 
type light; I mean, it was a constant light, but yet it was, it looked kind 
of rough. It was acutally sparkling, but yet it seemed to be just a 
quivering type light, if you know what I mean.

H I see, sort of a scintillating, in a way.

J Right, yes sir.

H Now, one important thing that I haven't asked you, is, how much of your, 
suppose you had taken a pencil or crayon and drawn on your windshield 
from you normal seating position, you'd drawn the outline of that light, 
how much, how big a spot on the windshield do you think you would have 
drawn?

J Just right off, I would guess that it would have been possibly 12 inches


- page 20 -

in width, possibly at the highest point it would have been maybe 6.

H Now, how did compare in apparent size, how much of the sky did it block out as compared to the amount of sky that the full moon blocks out?

J The full moon, you mean the moon at its own distance.

H Yes, as you see the moon on the sky it cuts off a portion of the sky.

J Well this particular light would cut out quite a bit more, a lot more than the moon would.

H One thing I often ask is if you held your thumb out at arm's length, would it have covered it?

J No sir, it would not.

H Now, how about the whole hand held out? at arm's length. If fact, try it now. Your hand held at arm's length covers up a (I'm doing it now too) covers up quite a good-sized chunk of the sky. You hold your hand straight out at arm's length.

J With your fingers pointing upward?

H Yes, with your fingers pointing upward and take the whole palm of your hand for instance, that cuts out a fair section of the sky.

J With my hand held at arm's length, fingers pointed upward, it would just about cover from the top to the bottom and it leave a portion of each side visible.

H Isee, that gives me a pretty good idea then, of how, in other words, it's a sizable thing.

When the engine was dead and there were no other cars passing, did you hear any noise at all?

J None whatsoever. There was no noise at all. I think one of the most sig- nificant things, as far as I'm concerned, I mean one of the things that


- page 21 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

intrigued me the most is this change in color and then the very high
rate of speed. It changed from this sort of yellowish-white color to a
bright firelight, reddish-orange color. And these aren't actual colors,
I don't think, but this is my explanation of them, sort of a reddish-
orange, very bright, much brighter than it had been, and at this point
the beam slowly receded, and it changed colors, brightened in intensity,
this is where it moved straight upward at a very high rate of speed, and
my brother is in the Navy, in the Naval Air Reserve, I've been out and
watched these jets fly, Phantom jets and all this, I've seen
them hit afterburn, and they are fast, but this object moved, this light,
moved much faster than anything that I have ever experienced before in
my life.

H   When you say straight up, do real ly mean straight up, or at any sort of
an angle?

J   It seemed to me to go just as straight up as it could go. And it seemed
to be moving so fast that it just completely went out of possible eye-
sights, in a matter of seconds. I leaned forward on the steering wheel
and watched it go up--and here is something else that is rather confusing
to me--when I sat back in the seat the car was creeping forward, the
engine was running, the car was still in drive the radio was playing, the
lights were on.

H   So you didn't have to start the engine again.

J   I do not recall restarting the engine. This is where people, they where up to this point they may
have believed what I was telling them, when I tell them this, then they
say well, you're just a crazy fool. A lot of them will walk off, but I

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Subj: Telephone call, 25 Nov 68 re UFO Sighting

Captain Major of Base Ops, Moody AFB, called and spoke with 2d Lt Marano on 25 November 1968. A Mr [redacted] observed a UFO on 22 November, 2005 local, 01052 10 miles west of Newton. The sighting had not been reported to the Air Force. An interview on the UFO sighting was made by Mr [redacted] WABL TV of Albany on 23 November. The vehicle hovered 50 ft off the ground, three off a very bright light, cut electricity in his car, object left straight up with no noise. Captain Major wanted to know what he should do about it. Lt Marano said that according to 80-17 we do not investigate second hand reports and should not go out and investigate, however, we would appreciate it if Captain Major sent newsclippings on the sighting to Wright-Patterson. Do not stir it up.

Approximately one hour later Captain Major called back. Capt Major it was going to be released by UPI that information on the sighting was going to be sent to the Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson. The Information office told the Upi that it was going to Wright-Patterson. Col Quintanilla informed Captain Major that they had no right to tell the UPI that it was going to be sent to Wright-Patterson because it was a second hand report and that they had better get on the line and tell SAFOI what had happened.

Col Quintanilla told him that if they told the UPI that they were going to investigate it then they had better get out there and investigate it. Capt Major said it was not him that goofed but Information office. Col Quintanilla told him that he had better get the Information Office people to get together with the Office of Information in Washington and let them know what they are going to do about the Case. Col Quintanilla requested that Capt Major call Col Quintanilla tomorrow (26 Nov 68) and let us know what action they have taken.

do not consciously recall starting the engine or turning the lights back
on, turning the radio on, or anything. And the car was in drive and this
particular car will not crank in drive.

H   Yes, you can't start it in drive.

J   It would have been necessary for me to have put it in park, cranked it,
put it back in drive, all subconsciously, and I just frankly don't believe
this happened.

H   You're raising this point about other peoples opinions. I'm always
interested in how other people regard this. Has this bothered you, affected
your life any, or do you find you talk about it much, or not at all, or
how?

J   Well, I've run into the two groups of people. One is the people that,
well, they think I'm the complete nut, just a complete crackpot, and I
talk very little to these people when I find out this is there attitude
I just sort of let it drop and walk off. And then there's the other school
of people that are very, they're all very interested in this, and they
ask a lot of questions from an interesting and very courteous standpoint.
These are the people that I thoroughly enjoy talking with, because I've
got a lot to learn about this stuff. I don't know anything.

H   Well, there's no one that does, you see. This is it, it's such a, the
whole thing seems to incredible that it seems much easier, you know, for
many people not to believe it and not to take it seriously because it means
less work for them, but the reports such as this now come in from many,
many countries over a period of years, and it is, at least for me, impossible
now any longer to doubt them. Let me ask a little bit about your own
background. How long have you lived in that community?


- page 24 -

Here is the text from the document:

J Well, we have been living here in Albany since '61.

H When you say we, whose we?

J Well, my mother and father and little sister and I moved here in '61, and went my Junior and Senior Year in high school here in Albany High School, then I went to George Tech College in Atlanta. Then I got married in August of '67, and my wife and I are both from this area, so we just decided to settle and build our home here. And we buying our home out on the east side of town.

H So that it looks to me like that you have a solid reputation behind you,

J Well, I've been Director of the local Jaycee organization, and this type thing. I'm not saying that this makes me the All-American Boy but I am proud of the reputation that I do have in this area, and I consider myself a half-way intelligent and half-way logical person.

H Well, you certainly should this way.

J That's why I don't like to talk to these people that are trying to pile ridicule on me because I don't think that I deserve this; I didn't ask this light or object or whatever it is to comedown and come near me and

H Well, you know, there are many txt who, I've been told later, when they finally get enough courage, they will tell me that they didn't want to report to anybody for quite a while because they feared this ridicule. People are very funny that way. When people don't understand, there is a great tendency to laugh.

Well, now let me see. Let me go back a little bit and ask, in your total experience, what one or maybe two things, well, let me ask you, what impressed you the most about the whole experience?

J Well, the thing, by impressed, I guess it could also be confused because


- page 25 -

this is impressive, it's very impressive how any light,&machine or whatnot, can completely stop an automobile, and then more or less at will allow this machine to start back functioning.

H: That does seem, I admit that I have no, nor do I think would any automotive engineer, understand how this could happen. Who was the first person you told this to?

J: Well, I first drove the 11½ miles to Newton and I stopped there and called the local sheriff, and told him I had something to report, but I didn't know exactly how to report it. So he said, Just tell me about it, so I did, and the only expression he had was, "Damn. I'm glad it happened to you and not me. I'm sorry but I can't help you." And he hung up the phone.

H: Well, at least he wasn't too discourteous.

J: And so, I saw that I wasn't going to get any help from this guy, so I then drove to Albany and went to the Sheriff's department there and the one feeling that I can recall, was such a feeling of loneliness. I wanted anybody, I wanted to talk to somebody and tell them what I'd seen. I mean, this was something that you don't want to just keep to yourself. You cannot keep it to yourself really. I mean, I think, if anybody did, witness something like I did and did not say anything to anybody, within a very short while I feel that it drive them more-or-less out of their mind, really.

H: I think this is what finally makes people report, even if they said that they weren't going to, because they, their own curiosity and their, also, sort of sense of duty in some cases. I know, I appreciate it when people do talk to me seriously about, because part of my job is to try to find


- page 26 -

out what's behind all this. And I now feel convinced that we won't find
out what's behind it unless we attack the problem much more seriously
that we have so far.

J   Well, one of these serious people I'm talking about that will actually
    sit down and seem very interested in this brought the Post, I believe it
    was Dec. 17, 1966. It had an article by you in it, and I found this
    article to be most interesting. Now as a matter of fact, you might have
    that Post handy; if you do, if you'll look on the front cover . .

H   I don't have it handy, but I remember the front cover pretty well.

J   There's, I think it's an artist's conception, of two UFO's. If you will
    take the largest of those two and blot out the green lights that seem to
    be around the oval, you pretty well have the last sighting that I saw.

H   You say, last sighting, what do you mean?

J   Well, just before it disappeared.

H   Oh, I see, the last sighting of this.

J   Right, the last picture I saw before it went out of sight. It was a large
    oval shaped orangish-red color.

H   Well, that's very interesting. Now, let's see. You then, I forgot whether
    you got much satisfaction from the second Sheriff.

J   Yes, he was very, the Sheriff's dept. here in Albany was very interested
    in the situation. As a matter of fact, while I filling out a preliminary
    report for them, they called the local television station, and, oh, I've
    gotten some wonderful publicity. The TV crew came down and filmed an
    interview, the local newspaper was very nice to put a very nice writeup
    in the paper.

H   Well, I'm very glad that you didn't get ridiculed by them.

J Well, at first, the television reporter thought that he' had a nut on his hands, but the more I talked to him, the more he saw that I had seen something. Now, I couldn't tell him what I'd seen, I mean I could explain it, but I couldn't tell him what it was, but he became very interested in it; at first, he set about trying to disprove the theory, I mean, of what I'd seen, and so he called the FAA, the Naval Air Station, and every military installation within a 100 miles and he called the local airport and all airportswithln a 100 miles trying to pinpoint someaircraft in this area. And he was never able to do so.

H Well, that's very interesting.

J The only thing he could find was a helicopter en route from Albany, which was traveling on a line approximately 20 miles north of the area that I was in. And that's the closest aircraft that he could ever pinpoint near me. The FAA said there was no aircraft within this 20 mile range.

H Well, I think that you would have recognized an ordinary aircraft.

J Oh yes, I feel sure that I would have. This boy tried to, he said it was maybe one of these jets that was taking some strobe light photography, that just as came over me I saw one of the strobe lights and then he hit afterburn, and that produced the red glow. He tried to explain it every way he could, but the Navy didn't have planes in the air at that time, so that sort of ruled it out.

H Wes, I would think so.

J He tried every way to explain it for me, I think, actually, on a very, he was very nice about it. But then since he couldn't explain it, he did the best he could to report what he had.


- page 28 -

H Well, that was good.

J And he did come up with two coon hunters, two people that were coon hunting, nearby, that did observe this strange light, for possibly an hour. Wait

H Well, I wish we could get hold of them.

J Now, I can give you the name of one of these hunters, but I'm not sure I have his address. His name is Bryan Glass and he was hunting nearby and from the reports that I've been able to get, by the grapevine from him, he says that they watched this object for approximately an hour and that it moved up and then it would go down; it would go straight cross for a while and it would rise and fall again.

H You know, it would be tremendously helpful if you could find the time somehow to talk to the [redacted] and without telling him too much about what you saw make sure in your own mind that he did really see the same thing, because this would give us an additional witness, here, which would be very important. [redacted] Not that I, in any sense, doubt your word, but it always helps if you have an additional witness.

J I do have his address. It's [redacted]

H Well, suppose I write to him, but also I would like very much for you to tell him that I'm going to write to him, and try to get an independent statement from him so that, so he doesn't merely repeat something that you tell him, so to speak, you see what I mean.

J Right, I won't give him any more of my details than absolutely necessary.

H Right, and if you wish, say that you're doing this for me and for the Air Force, and I'd sort of like to make you my deputy, so to speak, and if you would be kind enough to do this, I would appreciate it.

J I would like very much to say this, if any where in this particular area


- page 29 -

Here is the text from the document:

of the country, if you should ever like for me to help you in any way,
conduct any interviews, I would like very much to pursue this entire
subject.

H   Well good, I will certainly keep this very much in mind, because every
once in a while, well, I like to have people in various parts of the
country, so that when something comes up in that area I can call on them
to get me a first hand report as soon as possible, you see, before things
get cold.

J   Yes sir. Well I'd like to pursue the subject because it's the most
amazing thing that has ever happened to me, I assure you.

H   I suppose I should ask you some routine questions, such as when were you,
when did you last have any illness, or what is the general state of your
health, and are you happily married and all that sort of stuff?

J   Well, very happily married. I have the flu so that's my last major
illness. I've had ka the flu for the last three days and I/think i've
just about beat it.

H   At the time of the sighting, what was the state of your health?

J   At the time of the sighting I guess it had been 2 years or more since I
had been anywhere near seriously ill.

H   Well, then, I'm not worried about that aspect of it, anyway. I'm sure
that I feel that you wouldn't have any reason whatsoever br perpetrating
a hoax, there's no need to.

J   No sir, it's been kind of funny. Everybody, well not everybody, writ but
several people have asked me how much money have you made off it yet?
I haven't made any money and I don't intend to; now I believe I could come
up with a better money-making scheme anyway if I wanted to.

The page is numbered 16 in the top right corner.


- page 30 -

H   Oh, I would think so, yes.

J   Because I don't know anybody who'd want to come here and pay me to tell him a wild story, but this is something that everybody thinks that you may be out after something for nothing, but this is the furthest thing from my mind because it's just . . . I felt like I needed to report it to somebody and I had no idea at the time that it would go anywhere near this far. I never thought the Air Force would even be involved. I didn't really know, for this had really never crossed my mind. And I appreciate people like you in your position taking your valuable time to give me the time of day, because . . .

H   I'm very much interested in this and I'm hoping that those of us who are really and truly scientifically interested in it will be able to get some answers one of these days, because it bothers me to have this, these reports continue to come in, and nothing ever really done about it. One otherthing I wanted to ask, when You first say the light, was it in motion? The picture I get now is that you suddenly see the light and it's standing still. How did it get there?

J   I have no idea. As I said, I topped a little rise in the road and started into a real sharp curve and just came upon it.

H   And there it was, so to speak.

J   Yes sir. I feel sure that it was obscured by the trees prior to the time that I actually say it. There's very tall pine trees on each side of road in this particular area.

H   Let's seen now, give me another estimate, at the time that it was closest to you, or you were closest to it, how far away would you estimate, it would have to be a guess, of course, but how far away did it seem to you


- page 31 -

Here is the text from the document:

to be?

J Well, it appeared to be very close. I've always said in all of these reports between 50 to 75feet in front of me and approximately the same distance from the ground.

H One other way of looking at this, the trees that were lighted up we could measure and find out which tree was the most brightly lighted and get the distance that way. Were the trees right to the side or you or to the front of you most

J There were in the front of me that . . the trees that were brightest lighted were a little to the front and, of course, to the left and right of the road.

H Is it a fairly thickly wooded area where you were going through?

J Yes sir, actually this whole creek bottom that is very thickly wooded and then, of course, I had just passed this area and there is land, just recently, I would say in the last 3 to 5 years, broken up into farm land.

H Where are the, how close are the nearest houses?

J Approximately a mile to two miles.

H I see, so it's not exactly a populated area/

J No sir, it's very sparsely populated.

H Was there much wind that night, I don't know that that makes any difference,

J As far as I can recall, Dr. Hynek, there was no wind hardly at all, to speak of.

H Okay. I don't know which questions are the important ones to ask, but I try to get as complete a picture. Is there anything you feel you could add now, or, now that you've had some time to think about this whole thing, how does it appear to you today? You're apparently just as puzzled, but


- page 32 -

Here is the text from the document:

19

does it, well, I didn't ask you also, just really how frightened you were. What were you thinking about at the time as it happened?

J Well, at the time happened, I'll have to say that I was more frightened than I've ever been before in my life. The very strong impression prevailed that I was being observed, if you no what I mean;

H That's what I also wanted to ask, as to whether you felt that the thing, so to speak, knew you were there.

J You're dealing here I think, with maybe ESP or spiritualism, but I felt that this was some type of craft, some type of aircraft, that was controlled by some intelligent being. Now, I have no idea whether this was possibly some aircraft that max maybe our government was testing or whether it was some foreign government--Russian, Chinese or what not--of whether it was Martian. I have no idea.

H But still you speak in terms of a craft, but the fact remains that all that was visible to you was a light.

J Right.

H So that this happened many times before. The people say, well, no, all I saw was a light, but I think the light was attached to something.

J Well, it seemed to be a self-luminating dating object, if that makes any sense. It didn't seem to be reflective, and yet it didn't seem to be a light that was coming from way off somewhere else. It seemed to be a very close self-illuminating object. I mean, this was the source of light itself.

H Well, now one thing I should ask was the light intensity uniform over the whole thing or did it dim out toward the edges.

J It seemed to be dimmer toward the edges. The edges were, like I said, kind of fuzzy; they were not clearly defined.

H Was there, did you notice any smell in the area after it had left?

J To be perfectly honest with you I didn't stay around long enough to find out. I blew the radiator on my car going to Albany. Let's put it this way, when I got to Albany the water was just pouring out of my radiator.

H And a 67 Ford at that.

J Whether the beam, somebody said, well may be the beam had something to do with it. Well, I don't know, but I know I drove between 105 and 110 all the way to Albany. Well, I drove the 11 miles at that speed, then I stopped; then I drove 22 miles to Albany at that speed. And when I got to Albany the car was pouring water out the bottom.

H I can certainly see why. Did you ever check the battery? We've had some reports that the batteries have badly damaged in such encounters.

J Well, the battery hasn't shown any damage since this night. The entire electrical system and engine and everything has functioned 100% since then.

H Well, this is most interesting account and I hope you'll be willing in case I should have any other questions later to come back to you abit. And certainly I will hope very much that if anything else comes up in that area I can call on you. Also, please now, I really mean this, I do hope you'll check with... maybe try and find the other hunter, because every... your experience is such a good one, and you're obviously of such an intelligent nature that you're account is, well it hangs together; it's not a vague account by any means. So, I'm all the more interested in getting you to talk with M... is and seeing what you can find out from him.

J I'll be most happy to.

H


- page 35 -

H     And check the times too. See whether the times agree, more or less.

J     Yes. One thing that to me is kind of interesting is that, the fact that Apollo 8 just came back from the Moon and I feel that out of all this vast universe of ours, we have a small sun, actually, compared to other stars, the earth is a small planet compared to some other planets and all that kind of tommyrot, so why we should we be so self-centered, Dr. Hynek, to think that maybe we're the only intelligent creatures in the world.

H     Well, I think most astronomers would feel that we are not. That the possibilities are very, very high that we are by no means, the only ones. The problem, of course, we see no way in which these intelligentses could get here. But then, when we realize that in the last 100 years we've come from covered wagons to Apollo spacecraft, other civilizations may be millions of years ahead of us.

J     Well, that's the question that I have. Who's to say that maybe we're the furthest advanced of any creatures, some planets out there in another solar system of something. Maybe they've completed some way of traveling in time without suffering the aging process or something. Now this is something that I've read in some articles, I think, this may have been in your article, but who's to say how far other planets have advanced.

H     Well, that's a very, very strong possibility, and I think as an astronomer, most astronomers would simply agree that there's no reason whatsoever for our thinking that we are the most advanced.

J     Have you every by chance, run into a book called Interrupted Journey?

H     Oh, yes.

J     That is most interesting, isn't it?


- page 36 -

Here is the text from the document:

22

H Yes it is. I know Mr. Fuller quite well, and his Incident at Exeter which I think you should read is available in paper back, describes an experience rather similar to yours. It's called Incident at Exeter.

J Yes, I saw this, I believe, on the cover sheet of this other book.

H Yes, if you can pick that up at the library or in a paperback, I suggest you read it.

J HAs this account in Interrupted Journey, has this been more or less completely substantiated?

H Well, it's substantiated as a hard thing to say; it's been substantiated in the effect that no one thinks these people were liars, or hoaxters, but there just is no explanation.

J Right. It is one of the unexplained, then.

H Yes. We'd have to have more reports like it and see what patterns there are, what similarities there are. This is why I'm tracking down these cases in which cars stopped, because we have enough of those now to try to put the pieces together. Well, I tell you what Mr. Jones, it's been very enjoyable talking to you, and I think that You and I will keep in touch . .

J I'm sure we will. I'll be most happy to possibly talk to th- maybe over this weekend.

H Well, this would be fine. Please do send me the account, and let's try to get as much out of this case . . I think this case can be of considerable value to science, so let's keep digging at it, and if you come up with any recollections of additional things, that you, that come to mind that somehow slipped, please let me know.

J Let me put your address down here in case my wife didn't keep it when she

mailed that letter.

H All right, sure. It's simply Dearborn Observatory, or simply the Dept. of Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill. 60201.

J I'll possibly be up in that area on vacation next summer.

H Well, drop in\by all means, and we'll talk about some other cases.

J I'd love to come and talk with you. I have some relatives up in the Illinois area and if I'm anywhere near by I will most certainly be in touch with you and drop by and have a chat with you.

H Good, and I will call on you if there are any cases that come up in your general area. How close to Atlanta is Albany?

J I am about 175 miles from Atlanta.

H Which direction?

J South, southwest. I am approximately 80 miles from the Florida line and maybe 75 miles from the Alabama line. I'm down in the southwest corner of the good old state of Georgia. And we'd love to have you come visit us here sometime.

H Well, if you cook up, I shouldn't say cook up, wrong word, if a legitimate case occurs down there again, maybe I will come down.

J I'd love to have you. Thank you very much for your call Dr.

H Well, thank you also, for your cooperation and I'll be expecting to hear from you.

TMPT (UFO)

UFO Sighting of 22 November 1968 Near Newton, Georgia

Public Information Office
Fort Rucker, Alabama 36362

The Air Force is in receipt of a UFO report from about 12 miles west of Newton, Georgia on Route 91 (approximately 8620 W 311 N). The sighting occurred on 22 November 1968, sometime between 2000 and 2020 hours local (8-8:20 PM EST). The observer stated that he sighted a glowing object and that there was a beam of light that came from the object and lighted the ground in front of his automobile. The sighting has since received quite a lot of newspaper publicity and the Air Force would like to determine the stimulus.

Since the description is similar to that of a helicopter with its landing light on we would like to know if you had any low level helicopter activity in the area on the night of the sighting.
