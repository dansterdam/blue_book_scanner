On the night of July 20-21 a blinking light from an airplane. Boy Lucile came out on. As I looked up I saw something moving on a zig-zag course. After about 2 a minute it disappeared and a second later reappeared. Then after a few more minutes it seemed to have slowed of or stop near. The object was at low altitude. It was well west to east, before it slowed or stopped. By this star it looked like it turned in the direction of the star.

The image appears to be a scanned document page that is extremely faint and mostly illegible. While there are visible grid-like patterns and text elements, the resolution and contrast are so low that I cannot confidently transcribe any specific text. The page looks like it might be a form or data sheet, but the details are not clear enough to read with certainty.

Dear Sirs;

While I was at camp with my Boy Scout Troop I saw an unusual object in the sky. Here this object at our Boy Scout which is located about 8 miles west of Michigan City, Indiana. The date I saw this object was July 22 and from 8 to 9 pm writing to you I still just thought it was a satellite or tell tale but now I think it meant something else. I was unable to tell its course. It was not a satellite as near as much as it was at the object. The course I was was a little unusual for a satellite as near as much as I could make at the object. This as light gave very poor will to tell its course. I feel out of a great distance later came here it was a while of very fast aged fast then suddenly the strange and incredible it at once was time as a part of a strange of stars. I am thirteen years old am thirteen.

Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
It was hard to tell its shape because of its height. But it looked round as I have drawn below.

[A simple circle with an arrow drawn next to it]

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten sketch with annotations]

21. How long did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? It was hard to tell because of its height. Well it seemed to be as high as a star.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

I.e. would be completely covered

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It slowly faded out until I could not see it.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Because of its height it was hard to tell. But the only thing that came close to matching. Like it was a star.
