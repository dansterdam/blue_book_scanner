10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
This report does not contain sufficient xx info to allow a valid conclusion. There is some cause to believe that witnesses were good observers, ie they reported sighting objet to wt an elev of 45°. A short man might view an angle of 30° differently through a windshield. At such some special effort but the rule would be something less than 30°. Since this was winter the windows were probably up, therefore, due to this fact and noise of car motor no noise could be heard unless it was of considerable volume. It is possible that this objet was an a/c misidentified by witnesses due to their inability to see details and possible due to an exaggeration of the notions ascribed to obj in the action of witnesses.

This case is classed as Insufficient Evidence.
