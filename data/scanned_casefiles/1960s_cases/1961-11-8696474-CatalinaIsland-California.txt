MEMO ROUTING SLIP

TO: TD-E (Major Friend)

REMARKS:
Lt. [redacted], DCAS FT officer, telephoned in a report of an object recovered by parachute on Santa Catalina Island. Descriptive info is sketched on attachment; action taken is represented by FTD message 11-11-207, prior to which I called 1/Sgt Bolieu (Maj Friend was not at home). It was noted that the report included mention of English-language markings, one of which was "Reg US Pat Off CENTEX CORP," indicating that the object is not of foreign technology concern. Hopefully, by Monday AM, its proper owners will have turned up. I tried not to dampen Lt. [redacted] enthusiasm for recovering objects that fall out of the sky; after all, the next object might be Yuri Gagarin - or even ex-comrade Molotov.
