Project Blue Book,

Dear Sirs:

My name is * * * and I am thirteen years old.
I am a young space enthusiast. I've been reading up on space and I am interested in the unidentified vehicles as you call them. I understand that the greatest percentage of these sightings can be explained but, I think I have one that might fall into the unidentified category.

I'm a petrochemical employee in Trenton, Michigan and I get up quit early in the morning to deliver the newspapers. On the morning of March 14, 1966 at about 5:30 in the morning I was just starting my route when I happened to look upward as the day was breaking it was normally dark at that hour at the tower I saw a whitish blue object about the size of basketball slightly they were much bigger because I was looking at it from a distance and flying at terrific speed. At first I thought it might be some other explainable object like a meteor or a satellite but I gazed some other explainable and it was still there.
The light began to fade and I lost sight of it. A few moments later it came back on the radio station that the report had been received by the tower I suppose they were monitoring it. They said it was blue as they say and progressed steadily. It slowed down and then made almost a 90 degree turn going straight up and then it turned and went east and into another dive. It turned around and went west again just before it was coming to the tower it made another almost 90 degree turn and went up until it turned to the east and flew away.

I watched for about ten minutes from the time it first came into view until it flew out of sight.

The morning that I saw it was a clear and cold morning meaning that the sky was cloudless without a moon. As your station WWJD had picked up on it I assume others may have seen it also. Those were the conditions that prevailed at the time.

There weren't any visible burning lights like the other UFO's have had on them but, I noticed something unusual in the sky that I didn't think much of it until I read in the paper about the nearest Air Force Base or Project Blue Book. I never used to believe in them but I have do now. I'd like to know what your opinion of this sighting is.

Yours Truly,
Trenton, Michigan.
48183.

If were the kind of boy who imagined things I would
say this was so in this case. In the contrary he is
a very sensitive guy who realizes such influences with reality
and accuracy.

To kind information these so-called things six weeks prior
to this sighting but, was unaware as to what they were.
On the seoond sighting he did know they were not simply
lights and was not only shook up but very scared. He now
hesitates to lock skyward and hurries home from his newspaper route as quickly as possible.

I certainly hope he never sees these things again as I
too have seen them a year previous to his sightings and
it was Scorous.

He composed the letter and the drawing himself. He also
hopes his information will help some.

Should you want to question him further on this feel
free to do so as he does wonder as to the answer to this
mystery. Is there one?

Mrs.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts some kind of object or phenomenon, with a label indicating it is "POST TO INCLUDE 3R, d", and other annotations such as "WEST AWAY" and "EAST" along the horizontal axis, as well as "CAME FROM WEST" and "TREES TOPS". The overall shape and elements of the diagram suggest it may be related to a sighting or report of an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

TEXT/UFO
Request for UFO Evaluation, ********** 13 December 1966

Hq USAF (SAFOIR)
Reference the attached letter from ********** requesting the evaluation on his sighting of 8 March 1966. His case is being placed in the "Other" category, specifically, conflicting Data. In one place he mentions that the object disappeared after approximately ten minutes. In another place he mentions that the object did not disappear while he was watching it. The turns would have appeared much steeper than usual. As an aircraft in the distance could have been observed at such a distance, turns would have appeared much steeper than usual. The turns could account for the color fading at times.

FOR THE COMMANDER

LOUIS De GOES, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems

The image contains a diagram and some text, but no photographic elements. The diagram appears to depict the movement of an object or objects, with an arrow pointing in the "east" direction. The text mentions an "ASKYLINE" and a "RADIO TOWER A".

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90*   75*   60*   B

      30*
      15*
      0*

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
