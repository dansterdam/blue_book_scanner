When first saw it ducked across the surface then changed position and then reappeared. About 4 times.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
It appeared, will little hill either side of the moon.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: I could hear no sounds.
b. Color: Its color was black.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 3/4 of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

I had called the astronomer at the "Adler" planetarium, over here and he said that in his opinion it might have been atmospheric conditions and he had received many such calls (on the phone) as mine.

My telescope - power was 100 at highest. However, now have a telescope with its highest power in 266. And my lens on the 100 power telescope were clean and spotless at the time of viewing.

AUG 63

Dear Sirs,

I would like
to report some "Unidentified Flying
Objects".

It was in the year
of 1963, and the month was August.

On August of 1963,
Friday night at about 10:00 p.m. All
of your neighbors were sitting outside
and a few boys and myself were
looking at the moon through my
telescope when I suddenly saw
between 10-15 dark circular objects
traveling across the moon at a
fantastic speed. My boyfriends had
also seen them also.

I also called the
astronomer of the "Adler" planetarium.
And I have left out one one
thing, that is that it could have
only been, if possible, atmospheric
conditions, although visibility had been
good.
