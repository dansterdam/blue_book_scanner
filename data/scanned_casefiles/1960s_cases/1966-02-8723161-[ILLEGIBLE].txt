35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire, as a narrative explanation of your sighting. 

On the evening of February 12 at about 6:34 I walked out of my home to deliver a telegram to a neighbor. As I stepped outside on to the porch I looked up at the sky. There was an unusually bright warm glow in the east. This was very unusual about the time they had full moon. About two minutes later I started to go on into the garage, but something caught my eye to the southwest. There was a long luminous object traveling from west to east at a very high speed. It passed by in less than 10 seconds and it moved without a sound. I first viewed it at about 25Â° to the east-southeast. It was traveling at a tremendous pace going in an east to west direction from where I stood. It was just as steady as the sun slipped beyond the western horizon. The sky that night was crystal clear, and I was amazed as I watched this moving object. There was no sound made as it moved along the western horizon.

This object proceeded from east to west as it appeared to me. As it moved I noticed that it split into parts. I don't know if they were two different objects or if it just split up but they continued going east. They were luminous and did not appear to be burning. As I watched they became smaller and smaller until they disappeared into the mist. I'm sorry I cannot tell you any more details, but this is exactly what I saw that night. It was a very puzzling object, coming from the east and disappearing into the west. Coming from the east it was in sight for a very short time, probably less than a minute. When it broke up I decided to write it down and report it in case anyone else had seen the same thing. I have not had time to reply sooner. I hope the papers you sent me will give you a idea of the object I saw. One thing I would like to know is this: Are all satellites aimed toward the earth, and can they come out of the east and go to the west, southwest or can they come out of the east and go to the west, southwest or can the come out of the east and go to the west?

It appears to be a letter from Major Victor Quintanilla, Jr., Chief of Project Blue Book, responding to an unidentified observation report submitted on February 12, 1966. The letter thanks the sender for reporting the observation, but states that the information provided was not sufficient for further investigation. The letter appears to be dated June 13, 1966 and is addressed to "Miss" from Duson, Louisiana 70529.

Miss [REDACTED]

Dear Miss [REDACTED],

Thank you for your recent inquiry on information related to Unidentified Flying Objects. 

Neither the Kennedy Space Center nor any other agency of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is responsible for scientific or technical aspects concerning UFOs. This is a mission of the U.S. Air Force. I suggest you direct your inquiry to:

Air Force Systems Command (AFSC)
Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland

Sincerely yours,

[SIGNATURE REDACTED]
Paul C. Donnelson, Chief
Education & Community Service

Commanding Officer
Andrews AFB
Maryland

Dear Sir:

Please do not push off us citizens who see these unusual objects in the sky as "spot-lights" seekers bent on publicity. This is the second time I've seen an object moving at tremendous speed to waste. Only this one was most unusual.

Since I revealed this reply from NASA, I spent some time in a hospital film delayed in returning it to you.

Sincerely yours,

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a typed document, likely an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

March 8, 1966
Duson, Louisiana

Commander in Charge 
Space Program
Cape Kennedy, Florida

Dear Sir:

You can readily see by the addressee of this letter that I do not know to whom to write. And I have been floundering: these are unidentified objects and what-not looking at me, so it would be futile to write because this situation was threatened to the Assistant Director to write because this situation has gone several.

I'm a habitual star-gazer. I have over walked the field of a few acres looking for stars, but always away from the heavens with a dull routine and the like. But on the evening of February 12 at about 6:25 I saw - out of the corner of an eye - a brilliant warm orange-red star! I rubbed my eyes and observed it again. It was Venus, and much larger than I had ever seen it before. It was not twinkling at all, just a brilliant steady glow. It held its position until about 7:15 when it began to diminish in magnitude and color. By 7:30 it was darker than the incandescents, and col-lapsed to the horizon. The whole performance lasted about an hour.

But here is what astounds me. Shortly after this celestial display had ended a round, glowing object appeared in the southwest, first a dim light and then building up to a brilliant white light, and then diminishing again, all in a matter of five to ten minutes. It moved from one point to another, not in a straight line, but as if guided or controlled.

I do not know what this was, but I am certain that it was no normal celestial body or aircraft. I am a student of astronomy, and I have never seen anything like this before. I am hoping that you, or others associated with the space program, can throw some light on this phenomenon. I would appreciate any information or suggestions you might be able to offer.

Sincerely,
