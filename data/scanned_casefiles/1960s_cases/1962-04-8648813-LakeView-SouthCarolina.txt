Dear Sirs:

On April 4, 6:00 AM western standard time I was on my newspaper route and I saw something very unusual.

My town is about 30 miles from the sea shore. I was facing east just before the sun came up. The sky was very bright and above the clouds I saw a large rocket leaving over about 40 degrees with no exhaust. It all seemed very small. A little exhaust came out the top while two white plumes of what looked like small, long white. The rocket traveled across the sky somewhat. After they moved around so they could be parallel to each other traveling exactly north. Every few minutes a plane would come out of them to give them more speed. After about fifteen minutes I lost sight of them. It could be a "U.S. experimental rocket" but I really don't know.

It came 12 years old at a student in
