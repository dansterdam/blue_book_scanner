SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATIONS
(Abridged form for use of designated FAA stations)

The document appears to be a detailed weather observation log with multiple columns including:
- Time
- Sky and ceiling
- Visibility
- Weather and obstructions
- Wind speed and direction
- Pressure calculations

The form is filled out with various numerical and coded entries across multiple rows, with sections for detailed weather measurements and station pressure computations at the bottom of the page.

The top of the form has a header, and the columns are densely populated with meteorological data, though many specific details are too small to read clearly without zooming in.

Feb. 16, 1967

Major Richard Mathews
Hq. OOMA (OONEET)
Hill Air Force Base, Utah:

Dear Major:

After reading the article in the Worland, Wyoming Daily News this morning I decided to best to clarify the report of a UFO over Worland on Saturday, Feb 11th, at approximately 7:00 PM.

My fourteen year old son, and his friend have been experimenting for some days now with a hot air balloon, made of a plastic cleaning bag, and 16 birthday candles.

On the night of the 11th, they were quite successful as the launched it of the. The first three were reasonably successful, but the fourth was overwhelming.

We were entertaining some 26 people at our house when we were called out to watch, and this far far exceeded the entertainment Mother and Dad had for their guests, and he asked me to contact you, thus this letter.

Hope this saves you further trouble.

Sincerely,
[Signature area is blacked out]
