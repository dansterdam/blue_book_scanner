MAILING 'TIL CHRISTMAS

UFOs Seen Northeast Of Capital

Three Bismarck Airport control tower personnel and an airplane pilot from the Capital City and others were notified Tuesday night after sighting unidentified flying objects northeast of Bismarck Jack Wilhelm at the Bismarck Airport control tower and two other personnel, Jack Reeves and John Fischer, sighted two round white-colored objects, about the size of a large star about the time 9:30 p.m.

The report of Robert Watts, who was at Capital Aviation, who was flying a student in the area in the vicinity of the airport and they attempted to witness the UFOs, describing them in terms identical to the control tower reports.

Wilhelm and Watts said an Air Force radar system based at Great Falls, Mont. picked up foreign objects.

UFOs about 8 miles north of Bismarck.

There were indications that the Air Force was being called in to further investigate the sightings.

Wilhelm said the tower personnel Tuesday night of sighting something like they never heard before.

No sounds were heard Tuesday night.

UFOs . . .
Continued from Page 1

Wilhelm said the changes in speed and direction of movement disconnected the method of the UFOs being stars.

He noted the objects were foreign to the airport control tower as well as to the Great Falls radar system. Since they were not listed on flight plans.

Watts discounted the possibility of the objects being normal flying objects. He said they traveled considerably faster than aircraft and because of the speed and direction changes could not be normal satellites.

He said the objects didn't act like stars because and traveled north and the other south for a period. Then he said the object traveling south reversed course and moved to what appeared to be a short distance from the other.

The two objects then hovered close together for a few seconds and then just disappeared. Said Wilhelm: He said that in a split second they disappeared in an northeasterly direction.

Before the two objects joined one was positioned about 5 degrees above the horizon while the other was 30 degrees above the horizon. The lower object moved up to join the higher, said Wilhelm.

Watts gave a similar description of the objects, except he noted the did not see the two objects disappearing.
