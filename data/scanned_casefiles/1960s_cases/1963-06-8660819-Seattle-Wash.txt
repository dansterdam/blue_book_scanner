Since the Navy a/c was in the area at the time and experimenting with a high alt strobe, it is possible that this was the a/c observed. No mention of a/c is made by the witness as being in the area during the reported sightings. Case considered as a possible a/c sighting. (Satellite ECHO I not visible during the reported time in Seattle).

The rest of the text is partially illegible or cut off at the edges of the document, making it difficult to read the full content with certainty.
