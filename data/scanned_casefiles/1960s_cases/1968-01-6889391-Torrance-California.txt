Jan. 14th, 1968

Dear Sirs

I and my brother were down at a near by prog pond when suddenly I saw a flying saucer. It was in the horizon. Then I pointed it out to my brother, he was very surprised.

It was 5:00 pm, Jan. 14th, 1968. The saucer kept rolling and with every roll it would change colors. The flying saucer would only turn two colors, red and white.

[Below the text is a hand-drawn diagram labeled "DIAGRAMS" showing two overlapping ellipses representing "FIRST ROLL" and "SECOND ROLL"]
