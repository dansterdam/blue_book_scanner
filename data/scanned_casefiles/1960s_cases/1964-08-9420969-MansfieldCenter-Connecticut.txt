December 14, 1964

Dear Sir:

About three months ago I was sitting outside when all of a sudden one of the stars I was watching began to move across the sky. There were no sounds of engines, and it was not air-craft due to the fact that it had been in the same position for more than an hour. A few days later I saw a similar movement in the same area, with one exception, it would stop, then start again. The second time there were also no engine noises. Each time this happened a friend of mine was with me. I did not report this until now because I did not know to whom I was supposed to.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

[Signature is blacked out]
