11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer's report viewing object twice the size of the moon. In one case the object appeared as a bright blue comet coming directly at the observer. Others reported the object as bluish green with a glow. The object appeared to expand in size. At one quarter mile distant the object appeared to be 100 feet in diameter and ball shaped. Object gradually faded from view with the exception of the tail or streak of light that reminded observer of a comet.

On 24 Sep 66 at 0413 EST there was a launch of a Javelin vehicle from Wallops Island, VA. A barium cloud and copper oxide payload was ejected at altitudes of about 310 and 570 statute miles. The artificial clouds first appeared light green to red. As they enlarged, the clouds turned blue and formed elongated patterns.
