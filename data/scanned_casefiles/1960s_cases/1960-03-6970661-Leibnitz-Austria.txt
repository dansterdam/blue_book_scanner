This photograph was taken on March 2, 1960, by [name illegible] in Austria. The photographer said he saw a shining light ahead as he rode his motorcycle thru the countryside at 1 a.m. At first he thought it was a falling star. But as it remained motionless, he felt the heat, he snapped the picture from a distance of 50 feet. After 6 or 7 seconds, it flew off.

The photograph appears to show a blurry, somewhat circular white/light object against a dark background.
