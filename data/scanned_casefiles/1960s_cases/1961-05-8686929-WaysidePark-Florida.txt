Report on Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

1. Description of the object:
a. Shape - Like two humps. (See attached sketch)
b. Size - About 8 inches across (3 miles away)
c. Color - Firey red
d. Number - one but had two humps.
e. Formation - N/A.
f. Any discernible features or details - Bright red light, red haze and small dot of light.
g. Tail, trail or exhaust - None.
h. Sound - none
i. Other pertinent or unusual features - Two humps.

2. Description of course of object:
a. Sergeant Baumgart - at approximately 2115 hours (EST), 23 May 1961, my wife and I had just returned home from Port St. Joe. Upon arriving home my wife commented upon the fire out in the Gulf. She showed me where and it looked like a big blaze quite a distance away. We got in the car and drove to Wayside Park at Mexico Beach. I didn't think we could get a better view any closer to it or see it any better than from there. While we were watching it seemed to die out somewhat. It appeared to be a blaze but only in color. Usually with a fire you can see flames shooting up. This was not the case with this. It was stationary. The location, as best I could tell, was the point of beach northwest of Mexico Beach. (See attached maps). Only my wife, children and I saw it as far as I know. However, it was possible for anyone to see who looked in that direction.

b. Angle or elevation and azimuth of object - Parallel with horizon and in a northwest direction.

c. Angle or elevation and azimuth of object upon disappearance - Faded down.

Evaluation of Source Reliability: UNKNOWN

Analysis and Conclusions: THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE WITNESS IS CONFLICTING. A COMMENT IS MADE THAT THE FIRE WAS IN THE GULF PUT THE DIRECTION IS GIVEN AS NW. TESTIMONY OR BEARING APPEARS CHANGED AND SOME OF THE AREA INDICATES THAT THE WITNESS DOES NOT KNOW THE DIRECTION FROM HIS LOCATION.

THIS CASE IS CLOSED AS "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE" THAT THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WITNESS SEEING SOME LIGHT SOURCE WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BELOW THE HORIZON.

The image appears to be a map of the Gulf of Mexico region, with some legible text including:

Gulf of Mexico

Panama City

Chamber of Commerce

The map contains various numbered points and road/coastline outlines, but much of the text is faint or illegible due to the image quality. The map seems to focus on the Florida panhandle and surrounding coastal areas.
