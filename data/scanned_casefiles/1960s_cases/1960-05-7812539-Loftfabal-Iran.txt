SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object

SUMMARY:
At 0600 hours on approximately 16 May 1960 two low flying cigarette-shaped objects were sighted over the border area at Loftabal Border Post. One object came from the direction of Soviet Ashkhabad, flew over the border area then returned once more in the direction of Ashkhabad. The second object also came from the direction of Ashkhabad, but continued flight toward Khalata. The vapor trail left by these objects remained intact for two hours, then gradually expanded in the pattern of dissipating contrails. The border commander who saw the objects was convinced that they were not jet planes. The objects were wingless and had no visible pilots. The source contacted that there was no construction in his area. There have been no additional sightings to date.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER: CAS furnished the above information.
