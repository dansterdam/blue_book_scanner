There is no photograph present in this document. The image shows two maps depicting the positions of celestial bodies in the southern sky.

Arcturus Shines in Southern Sky
Several bright stars can be seen on June evenings. Most prominent is Arcturus, the second-brightest star in the northern sky. Others that are spica, Deneb, Vega and Capella, James Stokley reports.
Arcturus is quite bright in the south, a brilliant jewel-like star. It is the fourth-brightest star in the sky, outshone only by Sirius, Canopus and Alpha Centauri.
Arcturus is the chief star of the constellation Bootes, the herdsman. It is in the northern part of the southern sky, in almost the southernmost part of the region that is circumpolar from middle northern latitudes.
While Mars is the only planet visible, the constellations Scorpius, Ophiuchus and Libra are prominent in the southern sky. Antares, the bright red star in Scorpius, is conspicuous.
Arcturus is so bright that it can readily be seen in the twilight sky. With the naked eye, one can note that it has a golden or reddish color. This indicates that it is a star in the late stages of its life cycle, with a surface temperature somewhat cooler than the sun.
Arcturus Brightens Than Vega
Arcturus is so brilliant that it actually outshines Vega, the fifth-brightest star, which is also prominent in the northern sky. Only Sirius, Canopus and Alpha Centauri are brighter.
The color of Arcturus is a clue to its greater age compared to Vega and other bright stars. Arcturus is a "red giant" star, in the late stages of its life cycle, when it has expanded greatly in size but is cooler on the surface. Vega and most other bright stars are "main sequence" stars, still in their prime.

19 June 1961
No Case (information only)

Yours lt. Warner, Waukesha - A young married man, ex-USAF, reported seeing a large circular object hovering over a wooded area near Wisconsin Dells on Sunday, 14 May 1961. The object, estimated to be approximately 75 feet in diameter, was observed for only a few seconds before it shot up vertically at tremendous speed and disappeared.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

Saturday, 8 June 1961 
The witness, a field investigator for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), reported observing a bright, elongated object hovering over some 
trees approximately 100 feet from the witness's position. The object was said to be approximately 30 feet in length and 10 feet in width, and it appeared to be more rectangular than circular in shape. The witness stated that the object made no sound and the surface appeared to be metallic in nature. The object was observed for about 2-3 minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view. The witness's estimate of the size of the object was said to be smaller than the larger UFOs reported.

Transcribed text from the document:

Two (2) - aluminum objects, approx 4 ft. long, seen hovering over Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin on June 8, 1961. Witnesses said objects joined forming a single larger object, then separated. Objects were said to move erractlcally, appearing and disappearing. Witness was an observer of flight operations at a nearby airport, who was "very reliable."

"UFO WITNESS STATEMENT
Hereafter is a statement made by the witne s regarding his observation of a strange object in the sky over Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, on the evening of June 8, 1961. This statement was obtained by an Air Force investigator from the witness on June 12, 1961.
The witness, [NAME REDACTED], who resides at [ADDRESS REDACTED], Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, stated that at approximately 9:00 PM on June 8, 1961, he was standing outside his home when he observed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be luminous and was hovering or drifting slowly over the Wisconsin Dells area. He stated that the object appeared to be approximately the size of a small airplane and seemed to be approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet in altitude. The witness stated that he observed the object for a period of approximately 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight."

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

A cylindrical object was observed in the sky over Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin on June 8, 1961. The object was first seen at approximately 8:45 p.m. by two persons. It appeared to be a metallic, cigar-shaped object, hovering over the eastern part of the town. It was observed for about 10 minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. No further information is available regarding the altitude, speed or size of the object. This report is being forwarded to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for investigation by APRO-NICAP and other agencies. No further details are known.

WISCONSIN DELLS OF JUNE 1961 CASE $419
CAPTAIN D.L. HANAVIN, USAF RESERVE
On 8 June 1961, while on weekend reserve training duty at Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, I was contacted by the Wisconsin State Patrol, who requested Air Force assistance in investigating a reported UFO sighting near Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.

Upon arrival at the scene, I interviewed the principal witness, Mr. X, who stated that at approximately 1:15 AM on 8 June 1961 he and two companions were traveling in a car on Highway 13 south of the Wisconsin Dells when they observed a large, oval-shaped, luminescent object hovering over the highway approximately 300 feet ahead of their vehicle. The object, estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter, emitted a bright, pulsating white light which illuminated the surrounding countryside.

As the car approached the object, it suddenly ascended at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view. The total observation time was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Mr. X stated that the object appeared to be solid and metallic in construction and that it moved without any apparent means of propulsion.

Several other minor witnesses were interviewed, but their descriptions of the object were essentially similar to Mr. X's account. No physical evidence was found at the scene. Air Force personnel conducted a thorough search of the area, but no traces of the object were discovered.

This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
