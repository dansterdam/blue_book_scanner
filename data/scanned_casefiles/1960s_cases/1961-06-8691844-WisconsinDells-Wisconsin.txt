11. COMMENTS
Was in flight of sighting. Jupiter was low on horizon and quite bright. Reported object -3.5 is quite possible. The planet was distorted and discolored by atmospheric refraction and occasionally misidentified. Info provided with this sighting is very limited. There is no evidence which would indicate that obj. was not splatter.

ASTRONOMY

Arcturus Shines in Southern Sky
Several bright stars can be seen on June evenings. Most prominent is Arcturus in the constellation Bootes. Others are Spica, Deneb, Vega and Capella, James Stokley reports.

LOOK TOWARD west on a clear evening in June, and you will see several bright stars in the sky. This is the time for the astronomer a "first magnitude" perhaps the most prominent is Arcturus, in the constellation of Bootes, the herdsman, which is high in the south.

Along with Arcturus, show by position, along with other stars of the evening, at 8 appears about 10 stars, your own kind of standard time at first of June. By the middle of the month they will be dim, partly lost in the sun's glare.

Among the 10 stars in the virgin, this is one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac, the belt through which the sun, moon and planets seem to move.

The brightest star in Virgo is Spica, which is a first magnitude star in the constellation, two fists down from Arcturus.

This is actually a first magnitude star. It is almost as bright as Arcturus. This is a group of six stars shaped like the sickle, a group of six stars shaped like that.

The side of the sky is shown on the northern sky map. Close to it is Mars, the reddish planet, which is quite bright, almost because of its distance. On June 20 it will be but twice as far as the star about 156,000,000 miles away.

Libra Seen in the South
Low in the south you can see Libra, the scales. These stars, more very bright, are arranged in the form of a crescent like the constellation. To the left is bright Scorpius, the scorpion, is pretty steady, with the first magnitude star Antares, its noticeably ruddy in color.

Next Scorpius, in the upper constellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent bearer, along with Serpens, the serpent itself, is a group of stars to the left, you find Aquila, the eagle. In it is the star Altair, also somewhat dimmed because it is so near the horizon.

A little farther to the left and you come to the bright star Vega, which is the brightest star. (This is shown on the map in the northwest sky.) Above this group is Cygnus, the swan, with Vega, which is similar to brightness to Arcturus. Above it is Hercules, another well-known group, although it has some stars of the first magnitude.

Now below Vega is another group of stars, which is the familiar "great flyer" in part. And in this, to turn, are the stars Deneb and Mirfak, known as the brighter stars.

Actually, Arcturus, Vega and Capella are not nearly alike in brightness that seems first one and some another to be the brightest of the three. The fact that Vega is the most nearly white of the three, Capella yellowish, and Arcturus has a ruddy hue. However, one recent and authoritative listing puts Arcturus first and Vega second.

Arcturus is so distant that its light (which travels 156,000 years to reach us) is so faint that we say that its distance is 36 light years. Vega is 26 light years away, and Capella is 45 light years away, or approximately as Arcturus, which is 100 times as bright as the sun. Vega is equal to 50 suns, but Capella is still further, 47 light years, and exceeds the sun's brightness 129 times.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Copius the swan. As they appear in the
sky, the bright & times a bright u
is about 56 times as far. This means
that it must actually be exceedingly brilliant,
in order to shine so brightly more such a
great distance. Darien is about 5000
times as luminous.

Another distinction of Arcturus is its
rapid motion across the sky—rapid, that is,
compared with other stars. While the
planets change their positions from year
to year—even week to week—Arcturus
moves some 10 way in the same place. A
thousand years from now, the pattern of
the stars were arranged about as they are
now. The constellations looked by William
the Conqueror in 1066 about the same as
they do to us. But the stars are moving
across the sky. This motion is called the
even then they were about the great dipper
was then as now, and Sirius and Aldebaran
in the future they will have a still
different arrangement.

It was in 1718 that the English astrono-
mer Edmund Halley (of comet fame) an-
nounced the first discovery of star motion.
Over stars were in a little different posi-
tion in the sky from where they had been
noted in ancient times. Amongst the stars
which he compared was Arcturus, and he
saw, more that it changed its direction as rapidly
as a human lifetime. It will take more than
200 years for its direction to change as
much as the apparent diameter of the full
moon.

[In the center of the page, there is a clipped newspaper article, partially legible. The text I can make out reads:]

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Some words are visible but not complete enough to confidently reproduce without potential errors. The text appears to be a news clipping or report excerpt, but the majority of the text is not clearly readable.

The text on the page is partially legible. I can make out:

"Page 22. Attn: 479 Oklahoma.

The rest of the document appears to be very faint and difficult to read clearly.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

A cylindrical
object maneuvered in remembered
colors that appeared to be from a
white light source. The object was
first sighted by two witnesses who
were driving along a highway and
disappeared behind trees after
being observed for 1/2 to 3/4 of a
minute during a strange color
change. The object was round and
appeared to be metallic. Investiga-
tion by ATIC-MCAIR-Boekholt

Note: Some words are partially cut off or slightly illegible, so I have reconstructed them based on context and readability. The text appears to be describing a UFO sighting.

I would have identified this as clearly this low, shaped for low altitude and perhaps weather related. That it was moving definitely tracked, in time and position match says possible weather related. Some was not this picture. (Continue remarks on reverse side)

WISCONSIN FIREBALL OF 1961 JUN 28/37

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too small or blurry to reliably OCR. The visible text includes:]

Length of path
Ground track
Azimuth
Radiant
Declination
North correction

[There are some numerical values next to these items, but they are not clearly legible]

At the bottom of the document, there appears to be some additional text, but it is too small to accurately transcribe.

The document appears to be a scientific report about a fireball observed in Wisconsin on June 28, 1961.
