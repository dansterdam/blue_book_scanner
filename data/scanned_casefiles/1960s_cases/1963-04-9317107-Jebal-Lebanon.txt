Its static behavior, while considerably distinguishable from any, exhibited flying object.

Its very considerable velocity, I believe, was constant brightness of the light near have led me to assume it to be at a great distance.

I am sorry to say that a good deal of information will have given rise at the time I have now forgotten.

When in the field I momentarily seen a bright transit with me & having his ability to recall those of the kind upon return to several objects in my flying to inform I desire exact & to help of the result of the investigation.

1. (AGO) On 15 APR 63 sources was on a terrace on Jebal (coordinates not fully legible) in the north of Lebanon. This area is very local to and is accessible only by foot. His party consisted of four other professors. At 1915 hrs a bright flying object was sighted nearly overhead to southeast. It appeared to generate its own light, much like a star. The moon had not risen.

2. (CGO) As it traveled across the sky it made several very abrupt changes in course, much too quickly to have been an aircraft. As it approached the horizon in the southeast it turned course and eventually disappeared. When once more overhead, no sounds were heard at any time. The total time of observation was 10 minutes.
