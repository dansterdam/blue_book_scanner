10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Irregular shaped obj similar to auto headlight observed by two separate groups of witnesses. Brighter than a star. White color. 30 deg elev-ation descending slightly. Path horizontal from SW to NW. Passed through 16 deg arc gradually. Some witness indicated obbing motion. Second group observed for over two hours.

11. COMMENTS
VENUS at 295 deg az 10 deg elev at 2200 local moving tohorizon at 2300, 310 deg az. REGULUS at 250 deg az 30 deg elev at 2200 moving to horizon at 290 deg az at 0100 local time. Brightness indicates VENUS observation while duration and elevation: favors observation of REGULUS. Sighting attributed to one of these two objects or possibly both.
