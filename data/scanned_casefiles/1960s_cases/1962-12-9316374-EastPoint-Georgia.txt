The document seems to be a grid or chart with numerous entries, but I cannot confidently transcribe the specific text. There is a white circular object at the bottom of the page, and the document appears to be an old, black and white scanned document.


- page 8 -

The image appears to be a data sheet or log with multiple columns and rows. The text is somewhat faded and difficult to read in parts. On the left side of the document, there are some partially legible headers and labels, but the specific details are not clear due to the image quality. The document seems to be a structured form with numerous entries across multiple columns, typical of a record-keeping or tracking document from the 1960s. The page is numbered "2" at the top of the document.


- page 9 -

The image appears to be a data table or log sheet with multiple rows and columns. Most of the text is handwritten and somewhat difficult to read due to the low contrast and image quality. The document seems to be a grid-like form with vertical and horizontal lines creating numerous cells. A hole is punched at the top of the document, likely for filing purposes. The handwriting appears to be in cursive or script style, filling most of the cells in the grid. However, due to the image quality, I cannot confidently transcribe the specific text within the cells.

April 3, 1963

[Redacted] Avenue
East Point, Georgia
Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

Thank you for your interesting letter of March 28 regarding your well described observation of an unusual object observed on December 1.

Since your sighting occurred during twilight it seems within the bounds of possibility that the object was a balloon reflecting the sun's direct rays at first and then turning red as it descended or moved away from the sun into the earth's shadow. The writer has personally witnessed this white-to-red effect on balloons at a high altitude in twilight.

However, in case this is not the explanation for your observation, we are passing a copy of your letter to Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University, who is actively interested in unusual observations of this kind.

Yours sincerely,

Alex. B. Geddes

Gentlemen:

I have hesitated in writing you since the observation, of which I am about to relate, is so very rare. However, such Randall, of the West Palm Beach Newspaper, insists that I let you know what I saw since it may corroborate the observations of another observer.

On December 1, 1962 I desire to look at the moon with my six inch, f/15 (focal length) mirror, using light conditions, using a Ramakian eyepiece. (Celestron) I was near the moon, the sky appearing like hell with no cloud visible in the sky. I was about 200 yards out against the blue horizon of sky. At 1725 EST my wife and I were looking through the scope at the moon when I saw what appeared to be a mountainous shining brightly in the black area of the moon.

Point of sighting
Path of movement

It was so brightly and kept increasing in brilliance that I called my wife to come back and see it. As she looked into the eyepiece the luminosity made what seemed a spot on the moon. Then she said that it was starting to rise. At this time I was looking at the moon, but could see nothing out of the ordinary. When my wife stated that the spot was moving, I took my turn with the scope and want to state that it was bright, not indeed had turned a very bright red and was moving on a path. I first saw it as a very bright spot, then as a brilliant red and so continued, increasing in velocity, accelerating, until lost to sight.

I would suggest that the brilliance first got originated from the path then that point in the area of the moon would take it over the crater Cardanus.

I hope that this may be of interest to you.

The image appears to be a large grid-like document with handwritten entries in various cells. The text on the left side of the document is partially legible, but due to the low contrast and image quality, I can only partially make out some text:

On the far left vertical margin, I can see:
- "DEC 1962" at the top
- Some station or location names, but they are too blurry to read with certainty

The document seems to be a log or data sheet with numerous rows and columns, filled with handwritten notations. Most of the writing is too small and blurry to transcribe accurately. The document has a hole punched at the bottom, suggesting it was part of a larger file or binder.


- page 16 -

The text in this image is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The page appears to be a grid or table with various entries and markings, but the specific text cannot be clearly read. There is a white circular mark at the bottom center of the page.
