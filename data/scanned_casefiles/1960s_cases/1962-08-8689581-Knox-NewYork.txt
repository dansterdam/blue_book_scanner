Transcription of the text in the document:

"it is contended that the object was caused by a metcor or weather balloon.

(1) Witnesses - 1.10, Mostly
2. 2 - Soldiers reported it to State.Police.
3. Appeared as a glowing orange ellipse 
4. Moved east to west, at 5,000 feet
5. Disappeared in northwest

(2) Evaluation
1. Postulated the object was a METCER, based on reported size, shape, and flight path.
2. Could not determine why it was reported as orange in color.
3. Could not explain how two experienced observers could mistake a meteor for a high-altitude elliptically-shaped object with no tail.

It is concluded the officers did not mistake a meteor, but probably observed a high-altitude balloon. However, why it was reported as orange remains unexplained."

Carrying out OCR on the text in the document:

Suddenly it is noted that apparently at first the object was reasonably slow in its movements, then suddenly appeared to accelerate rapidly and move off at high speed. The object is described as being larger than a star, approximately the size of a quarter at arm's length, and elliptical in shape. It was observed to change direction abruptly, making very fast turns. The observer felt that the object was under intelligent control.
