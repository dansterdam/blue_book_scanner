K. ALL REPORTS RECEIVED INDICATED A SUSTAINED FLAME FROM TAIL OF
OBJECT. OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO BURN OUT AS FAST AS ORDINARY
METEOR. THE COURSE WAS STRAIGHT AND LEVEL, NOT THE TYPE ORDINARILY
ASSOCIATED WITH METERITE OR FALLING STAR. ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF FLAME,
COURSE AND TRANSIT TIME ARE REASONABLY SIMILAR.

ALTHOUGH MOST WITNESSES EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT ON FIRST SIGHTING
THEY THOUGHT THE OBJECT TO BE A JET AIRCRAFT, THEY LATER RESOLVED
IT TO BE MORE COMET-LIKE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS ACQUIRED FROM A TRANSITING PAN AMERICAN
737, FLIGHT NUMBER 122. THIS AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING EASTERLY AT 37000

PAGE FIVE RDIC 036 UNCLAS

FT IN THE VICINITY OF ICELAND AND REPORTED AN OBJECT WITH FIERY
TAIL CROSSING SKY AT A MUCH HIGHER ALTITUDE. (HIGHER THAN PAN
AMERICAN). DUE TO ALTITUDE, SUGGESTED SPEED AND GENERAL APPEARANCE
THE PREPARING OFFICER IS OF THE OPINION THAT IN FACT THIS
SIGHTING WAS A COMET, SATELLITE, OR METEOR. NO FOLLOW UP REPORT
WILL BE SUBMITTED UNLESS REQUIRED BY AFSC (TEL).
