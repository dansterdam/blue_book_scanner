ALL REPORTS RECEIVED INDICATED A SUSTAINED FLAME FROM TAIL OF OBJECT. OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO BURN OUT AS PAST AS ORDINARY METEOR. THE COURSE WAS STRAIGHT AND LEVEL, NOT THE TYPE ORDINARILY ASSOCIATED WITH METEORITE OR FALLING STAR. ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF FLAME, COURSE AND TRANSIT TIME ARE REASONABLY SIMILAR.

ALTHOUGH MOST WITNESSES EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT ON FIRST SIGHTING THEY THOUGHT THE OBJECT TO BE A JET AIRCRAFT, THEY LATER RESOLVED IT TO BE MORE CONSISTENT.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS ACQUIRED FROM A TRANSITING PAN AMERICAN 727, FLIGHT NUMBER 122. THIS AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING EASTERLY AT 37,000 

PAGE FIVE RADIO 286 UNCLAS

FT IN THE VICINITY OF ICELAND AND REPORTED AN OBJECT WITH FIERY TAIL CROSSING SKY AT A MUCH HIGHER ALTITUDE (HIGHER THAN PAN AMERICAN) DUE TO ALTITUDE, SUGGESTED SPEED AND GENERAL APPEARANCE, THE PREPARING OFFICER IS OF THE OPINION THAT, IN FACT, THIS SIGHTING WAS A COMET, SATELLITE, OR METEOR. NO FOLLOW UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UNLESS REQUIRED BY AFSC (USAF).
