UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

At 1145 hours on November 17, 1967, near Ucon, Idaho, reported to the USAEC that she had observed an unidentified flying object during the evening of November 16, 1967. Mrs. was traveling north on U. S. Highway 191 enroute to Rigby, Idaho, at the time. She stated her location was about one and one-half miles north of the Idaho State Police Port of Entry at Beeches Corner when this large, bright object came down from her right to about 30 feet off the highway and then disappeared over a field on her left. It seemed to have many green and blue lights on it.

It is our understanding that the U. S. Air Force has a compilation of reports on U.F.O. sightings, and it was determined to recontact Mrs. Cook to supplement this report for their information. Contact could not be established with her until 1908 hours on November 17, 1967. This conversation is reported in the form of questions and answers as follows:

Question: What was the approximate time you observed the object?
Answer: It was about 6:45 p.m. on November 16, 1967.

Question: What were the weather conditions?
Answer: The sky was clear; but, of course, it was dark.

Question: Were there any other witnesses?
Answer: I was driving alone at the time and don't know if anyone else observed it.

Question: Could you describe the shape and size of the object?
Answer: It was oblong and similar to a large meteor, although I didn't think of it as being a meteor. It was larger, brighter, and closer than any I have ever seen. I could not guess at the size. It was somewhat like looking at the moon; you know it is large but you can't tell how large.

Question: Did you detect any sound from the object?
Answer: No.

Question:    What was the direction and speed of flight?
Answer:      It came from the east and disappeared over a field to the west. It approached in a long, slow glide like an airplane coming in for a landing. I would say its speed was about 40 miles per hour.

Question:    How long did you observe the object, and did you stop your car?
Answer:      I observed it less than one minute, about 30 seconds. I did not stop the car. I would have if it had landed.

Question:    What was the approximate height from the ground at all times and the distance from you at its nearest point?
Answer:      I couldn't guess at the height when I first saw it, but it glided down to about 30 feet off the ground when it neared the highway. It appeared to be about one-half mile ahead of my location.

Question:    Describe any system of lights and colors you observed.
Answer:      Actually, I guess there weren't any definite lights, but it glowed bright with color. It seemed blue-green at the front and reddish-orange towards the rear, each color blending into the next.

Mrs. [redacted] could add nothing more to the incident since the object was in view for only 30 seconds.

assigned this base were grounded due to a local ground fog. Civil
flights from the municipal field at Boise, Idaho, were also suspended
at this time. However, visibility was not restricted in outlying areas
as indicated by the clear condition contained in the attached report.
