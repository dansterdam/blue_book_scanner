As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Gentlemen:

I am submitting a U.F.O. report which I would like you to examine. I am submitting all information that I can possibly report.

There were 5 objects sighted. The objects were disc-shaped and each one disc-emitted an eerie light. The lights of some were very bright, others dim. The objects were spotted in the town of China Grove which is located 9 miles out of Salisbury in the county of Rowan. The objects were spotted for the time between 5:30 and 10:30 p.m. Many people were standing still while others were moving quickly. Many objects disappeared, then re-appeared quickly. The brightest object was moving at a 45 degree angle to the South. The objects were spotted on Sept. 7, 1966. There were people who saw the objects.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing the observer's personal account and views on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that they and their family or neighbors have reportedly witnessed.

Objects. This includes my father and mother; my best friend and my neighbors - the daughter and me.

Everyone will swear that they saw the objects.

My Personal Views.
I would like to express my personal views on the U.F.O.'s we saw. We have many books on U.F.O.'s. When we spotted the objects, we looked at these books plus the sab., 1956 closed file, and we have come to certain definite conclusions on the above subject.

My family + my neighbors have decided it was an airplane; no. satellite, and no balloon.

Please, in a return letter express your views about the U.F.O.'s that we spotted.
