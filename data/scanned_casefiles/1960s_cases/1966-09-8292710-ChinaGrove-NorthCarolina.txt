Gentlemen:

I am submitting a U.F.O. report which I would like you to examine. I am writing all information that I can possibly report.

There were 5 objects sighted. The objects were disc-shaped and each one disc emitted an eerie light. The lights I saw were red, green, white, orange. The objects were spotted in the town of China Grove which is located 9 miles out of Salisbury in the county of Rowan. The objects were spotted in the state of North Carolina. The time the objects were spotted was between 8:30 and 10:20 p.m. The sky was cloudless. Some discs were standing still while others were moving at terrific rates of speed. Many objects disappeared, then re-appeared quickly. The brightest object was moving from N. to S. at a terrific rate of speed. This object was moving at a 45Â° angle to the South. The objects were spotted on Sept. 4, 1966.

There were 6 people who saw the (over)

objects. They include my father and mother;
my best friend and my neighbor + his
daughter and me.

Everyone will swear that they saw
the objects.

My Personal Views.

I would like to express my personal views
on the U.F.O.s we saw. I have many
books on U.F.O.s. After we spotted the
objects, we looked at these books plus
the Lib. 1966 Project Bluebook and we
have come to certain definite conclusions
on the above subject:

My family + my neighbors have decided
it was no meteor; no airplane; no
satellite and no balloon).

Please, in a return letter express you views
about the U.F.O.'s that we spotted.
