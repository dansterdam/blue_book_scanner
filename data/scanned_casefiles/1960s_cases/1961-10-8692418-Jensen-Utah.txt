9. COMMENTS
An inversion was present at approx 8000' in Utah area on date of sighting. Due to inversion there was probably a superior mirage of distant mountain tops appearing as objects in air. Motion of mirage due to planes movement. Relative geometry would remain constant. Pilot was actually observing tops of new mountains or different parts of same range. Sightings are similar to that of Kenneth Arnold which occurred in June of 1947.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Pilot observed 3 objects ahead. As he approached they appeared motionless. Climbed to 8,500 and approached to 5 mi. Objects then disappeared to SSW in 1 1/2 min. No radar pick up in area at sunset.

SUBJECT: (U) UFO

DATE OF INFO: 16 October 1961
PLACE: 

EVALUATION: B-2
SUBJECT: Source below named
SUMMARY:

At 0322 hours on 17 October 1961 a report of a UFO sighting was received from a civilian pilot, for Salt Lake City, he sighted three objects approximately ten miles east of Beasley, Colorado (WR-228, 105-NW). The altitude was 7570 Feet at the time of sighting. He advised he was 5700 Feet on a level with the objects who were west of him. Visibility at Hill Air Force Base at the time was clear, visibility fifteen miles, ceiling unlimited, and winds were light. He approached the objects in a very straight line and as he came closer, the objects moved away at a very high speed. The objects disappeared in the south, southwest, approximately 200 in a minute and a half.

1. At 0322 hours, 17 October 1961, he reported that at 0102 hours 17 October 1961 he sighted three objects approximately ten miles east of Jensen, Utah. He was flying toward the objects that were approximately in the sky at 7570 Feet, raised to 8570 on a level with the objects and as he neared them approximately five miles, they raised an disappeared in a southwesterly direction in a minute and a half. Myron Range Control (AC-LON, 110 064) at 0322 hrs. Myron Range Control noted no aircraft in area and no sighting of objects.

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with numerical markings on the vertical axis ranging from 0 to -1050. The grid lines are faint and the image is a black and white scan with some dark edges, likely from the scanning process. The vertical axis on the left side has numerical markings, and the horizontal axis seems to have numerical markings as well, though they are less clear. The image looks like it could be a scientific or technical chart or graph, but the specific details are difficult to discern due to the low contrast and faintness of the grid lines.


- page 13 -

The image appears to be an Adiabatic Chart with a complex grid system. Most of the text is too faint or blurry to be clearly read through OCR. The only clearly visible text at the top right of the document reads "ADIABATIC CHART". The rest of the document consists of a detailed grid with numerous lines, numbers, and markings, but the specific details are not legible.


- page 14 -
