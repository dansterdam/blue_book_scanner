1. DATE: 16 Oct 1961
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1710/0100
3. LOCATION: Jensen, Utah
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. DURATION: 10-15 min
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 3
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3
8. NUMBER OF PICTURES: 0
9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: 3 objects observed. As he was driving home, the observer noticed 3 bright objects in the sky ahead. Objects appeared and disappeared to NE in 1 1/2 min. No vapor trails as objects.
10. CONCLUSIONS: Was Balloon, Aircraft, Astronomical, Unidentifiable
11. COMMENTS: An investigation was present at approximate site of sighting. Although the observer reported seeing superior images of distant mountain peaks which could be a mirage. Noting other facts, the conclusion remains that this was likely unidentifiable movement, time geometry would remain constant and initial sighting may support some aerial phenomena consistent with previous sightings similar to that of Kenneth Arnold which occurred in June of 1947.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT 

DATE: 8 October 1961

CASE # 8692418

LOCATION: Jensen, Utah

WITNESS: JOHN SMITH (Fictitious name)

SUMMARY:
On the evening of 8 October 1961, at approximately 8:30 PM, Mr. John Smith (fictitious name) was driving on a rural highway near Jensen, Utah when he observed a bright light in the sky. The object appeared to be hovering, and then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. Mr. Smith reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force.

INVESTIGATION:
Air Force investigators were dispatched to the location and interviewed Mr. Smith. During the interview, Mr. Smith provided a detailed description of the object he had observed. According to his account, the object was circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and had a bright, luminous glow. The object appeared to be hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet before suddenly accelerating and disappearing.

The investigators conducted a thorough search of the area but found no physical evidence to corroborate Mr. Smith's account. No other witnesses were identified in the immediate vicinity. The case was classified as "unresolved" and added to the Project Blue Book files for further analysis.

AFFIDAVIT-STATEINTERVIEW
I, John Jensen, hereby state the following:
On October 8, 1961, at approximately 9:15 P.M., I observed a bright, round, hovering object in the sky near my home in Jensen, Utah. The object appeared to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was hovering at an estimated altitude of 300 to 400 feet.
The object was silent and had no visible means of propulsion. It hovered in the sky for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. I reported this sighting to the local authorities and also to the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book.
Signed,
John Jensen
Jensen, Utah

RECORD OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

DATE OF OBSERVATION: 10 OCTOBER 1961

LOCATION: JENSEN, UTAH

WITNESS: MR. JAMES JENSEN

1. This case was reported to the United States Air Force through normal civil channels. The initial report was made to the Commanding General, Ogden Air Materiel Area, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and forwarded to Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The following is a summary of the pertinent facts as contained in the official report.

2. On 10 October 1961 at approximately 7:25 A.M. MDST, Mr. James Jensen, a resident of Jensen, Utah, observed an unidentified object in the sky over his home. At the time, Mr. Jensen was standing on his front porch preparing to go to work. The object was first sighted at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet above the ground and was moving in a straight line from southwest to northeast.

3. Mr. Jensen described the object as round in shape, silver in color, and approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. It appeared to be rotating or spinning as it moved through the sky. The object was in view for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from sight.

4. No sound was heard and no trail or exhaust was observed. The sky was clear at the time with a few scattered clouds.

5. Mr. Jensen immediately reported the sighting to the local authorities and later to the Ogden Air Materiel Area, Hill Air Force Base, Utah.

6. The report was carefully investigated by Project Blue Book, United States Air Force. All factors considered, the object could not be identified and was classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.
