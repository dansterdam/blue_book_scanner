9:00 Mon. eve. 4/5/65

While it's fresh in my mind, I'll write this down, because I've never seen anything like it before in the sky.

I came home about 5 or 10 minutes before 8 P.M. tonight - got out of the car with the baby - ready to go in the trailer. I looked up at the sky and saw what I thought was a very low-flying "wing plane." (It seems quite a few years ago they built a few experimental planes shaped like a "bat" or "wing.") Since I had never seen such a plane in the sky I kept looking at it. There were about 10 lights. The lights were in the shape of a "V". (Only more spread out like this:)

As I continued watching, all of a sudden, the lights (mostly the ones at the tip of the "V") seemed to go crazy. They intermixed (scrambled), but maintained the same speed as the rest of the lights, then went out of sight.

During this time, and for several minutes afterward, I heard no airplane motor noise. Each light was the same size - a pinpoint (as the stars) - not as big as the North Star.

Total time elapsed: about 7 seconds. Holding a tape measure at arm's length, the expanse of sky was 3½". Angle of view: Eastward, the lights at a 45° angle to the earth. Lights constantly moving.

My emotions: Truthfully, my very first thought (a stupid one) was that it was a group of birds, but quickly discounted that because they were lights. Then I reasoned it was a "wing" plane. (Darn! What do they call those planes?) Flying very low. Then, when the lights were a little more than halfway through the scope of sky that I could see and started moving around, but kept up with

Here is the text from the document:

the others, I got shook and realized I had just witnessed a U.F.O. (Oh, U.F.O.'s)

Right now, as I'm writing this down, I wonder if anyone else saw those lights tonight. Of course, I've heard reports of flying saucers and the like. Like most people, I believe what I see, and what I saw was not the usual. I don't think many people would have seen it - I out of a 1000? I out to be looking at that particular moment and that particular patch of sky---------

Right now my emotions have died down some and it's another page of my life------

*** 

Dear Sir(s):

Friends suggested I send this information to U. F. O. I typed this exactly as I wrote it on Monday night. There is, however, one alteration (an addition and correction) to make. I thought I was facing (eastward and that the "lights" were going from South to North. Will draw a picture of sunrise-sunset directions instead. You take it from there--

Sincerely,

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY

EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201
30 April 1965

Mrs.
Rockaway, New Jersey

Called on Sunday evening, April 25, 1965.

The woman sounds fairly reliable, but she still doesn't think the things were birds. She seems impressed by the high angular rate of motion and particularly by the scrambling of lights toward the end. There do not appear to be any bright lights in the neighborhoods as the trailer camp is on the outskirts of the town and mostly a profile in black. Although it is on a highway, Route 46, the highway is not lighted and there are mostly open fields around it. The color of the lights, a yellow-orange, does not suggest reflection from the body of a bird.

It was a very clear night, and the stars were out. When asked how the lights would compare with the Big Dipper, she indicated that they would be a little brighter than the stars of the Big Dipper and changed her mind, figuring that in general they would be bigger but not brighter than the stars.

Hq SAFOI/CC/7282/11 Jun 65

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]

Reference is made to your letter reporting your observances of aerial objects which you could not identify. The following evaluations have been made regarding the various sightings you made between 13 April and 5 May 1965:

1. The observation of 13 April 1965 has characteristics normally associated with balloon, or most similar suggested, small kite.

2. The sighting of 29 April 1965 contained a statement that the object was moving quite slowly. However, the duration reported in one status. The descriptive and duration of the flight is consistent with that of an observation of an aircraft reflecting sunlight.

3. Sightings of 1 May from 1610 to 9:50 PM are consistent with the observation of an astronomical object, such as the Star Spica and the Planet Mars. Both of these astronomical objects were in the south at the reported time and of the observational, altitude perspective and azimuth, a specific object cannot be identified. The observations at 1947 and 1959 PM are similar in nature, some I, some II, or remains I. However, it is likely that you observed one of the other satellites or an aircraft.

4. Sightings on 5 May can also be attributed to aircraft of activity. Two II was over Chicago, Illinois, at 1140 PM, EDT, heading southwest; John I was over Chicago at 9:45 PM, EDT. It is likely that the final observations from 9:40 to 9:48 PM was aircraft. The other observations were probably aircraft.

The Air Force bases in Illinois are Chanute Air Force Base which is one mile from Rantoul and Scott Air Force Base which is located six miles from Belleville.

ATTN OF: TDSW
SUBJECT: UFO Observations, 13 Apr - 5 May 65, Oak Lawn, Illinois

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
Washington, D C 20330

28 MAY 1965

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted] reporting unidentified flying objects. The following evaluations have been made regarding the various observations sighted by Mr [redacted] between 13 Apr and 5 May 1965:

a. The observation of 13 Apr 65 has characteristics normally associated with balloons or as Mr [redacted] sister suggested, small kites.

b. The sighting of 29 Apr 65 contained a statement that the object was moving quite slowly, however, the duration was reported as one minute. The description and duration of the flight is consistent with an observation of an aircraft reflecting sunlight.

c. Sightings of 1 May from 9:12 pm to 9:50 pm are consistent with the observation of an astronomical object such as the Star with the Planet Mars. Both of these astronomical objects are in the South at the reported time of the observation. Without specific elevation and azimuth, a specific object cannot be identified. The observations at 9:47 pm and 10:09 pm are similar to reports of aircraft or satellites. Neither of these objects were ECHO I, ECHO II or PEGASUS I. However, it is likely that he observed one or more satellites or an aircraft.

d. Sightings on 5 May can also be attributed to aircraft or satellites. ECHO II was over Chicago, Illinois at 9:26 pm, Daylight Savings Time, heading SE, ECHO I, was over Chicago at 9:45 pm, Daylight Savings Time. It is likely that the final observation from 9:40 to 9:40 pm was ECHO I. The other observations were probably aircraft.

2. It is suggested that a Fact Sheet be forwarded to Mr [redacted] along with your reply.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some words are partially illegible or cut off at the edges, so I've transcribed as accurately as possible]

on Saturday, May 1, 1965, a saucer-shaped great light satellite crossed the Southern sky. What stopped the movement was a great halt. At a point near the town of Pilar, a bright flying object was seen. A few moments later, a cry something else like out of Long was uttered & a small pair of binoculars. A solid see that the object was a great metallic machine, a kind of flying saucer a few meters away. At first seemed no to be a kind of a record, but similar network. At times - would see the object alone. In the work, he was able to examine. Around it was a kind of strange.

[The rest of the text continues in a similar fragmentary manner, with some words and phrases clearly legible and others difficult to make out completely. The text appears to be describing a UFO sighting, but due to the image quality and partial cutting off of text, a complete verbatim transcription is challenging.]

UFO Observations, 23 May - 5 May 69, Oak Lawn, Illinois

28 MAY 1965

HEADQUARTERS (Hq USAF)
Washington, D C 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from _______ forwarding
unidentified flying objects. The following evaluations have
been made concerning the various observations cited by
between 13 Apr and 5 May 1965:

2. The observation of 13 Apr 65 has characteristics normally
associated with balloons or an IFO (identified flying object).

3. The sighting of 20 Apr 65 involved a near miss that was
close to a tower, quite close, and was reported by a tower
operator. This observation is not conclusive.

4. Sighting of 1 May 65 at 2030 hrs was of two outstanding
bright objects which appeared to be round and were observed
for several minutes. This observation appears to be more
significant and might be considered as an unidentified flying
object.

5. Sighting on 5 May 65 in this area, Illinois, is probably
explainable. Weather conditions were clear. The light was
seen 20 min. This sighting was probably a celestial object.

6. It is suggested that a fact sheet be forwarded to answer
along with your reply.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

At 9:12 p.m. on Saturday, May 8, 1965, a saucer-shaped craft that was apparently over Walsenburg, Colo., was sighted by a sister. She said she saw something like a dot out of the upper right-hand corner of the sky. It was a very noticeable, clear, solid object. She could see some portion of it.

From a small pair of binoculars, I could see that the object was not a star as it had a definite outline more or less. It was moving at a rather slow pace, and it seemed to be attended by a second, well smaller object. It could see a bright, radiant aura. In suggest to be a weather balloon, the object occasionally shifted its path over the sky. It was a bright object that we made a slight rise over the ground.

About 9:17 p.m., the same saucer-shaped craft was again sighted, moving slowly across the sky. The object was round, bright, and seemed to be moving at a steady pace.

About 9:40 p.m., we saw a reddish blue-white shaft in the east, about 50 mi. in a southerly direction. Brighter near the large cloud area. It was a peculiar shaft, and seemed to lower and found some burning aspects of it.

The text appears to be a detailed account of a UFO sighting, describing multiple observations of an unidentified flying object over Walsenburg, Colorado on May 8, 1965.
