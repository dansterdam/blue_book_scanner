While it's fresh in my mind, I'll write this down, because I've never seen anything like it before in the sky.

I came home about 5 or 10 minutes before 9 P. M. tonight - got out of the car and noticed the lights in the sky so I took a good look at them and saw what I thought was a very low-flying twin plane. (It seems quite a few years ago that I believe a twin plane.) Since I had never seen such a plane in the sky I kept looking at it. There were about 10 lights. The lights went in in a "V" - (Only more spread out like this: and yellow-orange in color.

As I continued watching, all of a sudden the lights (mostly the ones at the tip of the "V" seemed to go crazy. They intertwined (scrambled), but maintained the same speed as the rest of the lights. Then went off sight.

During this time, and for several minutes afterward, I heard no airplane motor noise. Each light was the same size - a pinpoint (as the stars) - not as big as the lights I'm accustom.

Total time elapsed: about 7 seconds. Holding a tape measure at arm's length, the expanse of sky was 5". Angle of view: Eastward, the lights at a 45Â° angle to the north. Lights continuously moving.

My emotions: Truthfully, my very first thought (a stupid one) was that it was a group of birds, but quickly dismissed that because they were lights. Then I assumed it was a "flare", (that's what they call those planes) flying very low. Then, when the lights were a little more than halfway through the scope of sky that I could see and started moving around, but kept up with each other amazingly, I felt go with the

the others, I got shook and realized I had just witnessed a U.F.O. (On, U.F.O.'s)
Right now, as I'm writing this down, I wonder if anyone else saw these lights besides me. Of course, I've heard reports of sightings and the like. Like most people, I believe what I see, and what I saw was not the usual. I don't think these same people would have seen it - I was to the point of 1900, I am out of a FOOD - in the looking at that particular moment and that particular patch of sky--------
Right now my emotions have died down and it's another page of my life---

Dear Sir(s):
Friends suggested I send this information to U.F.O. I typed this exactly as I wrote it on Monday night. There is an addition and correction I wish to make. 
The flight path was going from North to West. Well I know a picture of surprise --at directions instead. You take it from there--

Respectfully,

30 April 1959

Mrs. [REDACTED]
Rockaway, New Jersey
Called on Sunday evening, April 25, 1959.
The woman seemed fairly reliable, but she still doesn't think the things were birds. She seems impressed by the high angular rate of motion and the regularity of the motions. These do not suggest the birds. There do not seem to be any distinct features, such as wings or tails. It is on the outskirts of the town and mostly in back. Although it is not a light, it is brighter than the background and there are no indications of the normal shape of a bird. It does not suggest reflection from the body of a bird.
It was a clear night, and the stars were out. When asked how the light compared with the Big Dipper, the witness stated that they would be bigger but not brighter than the stars.

Note: This was not the reason I don't have a date in this case? I don't think it was received.

I am on an amateur observer and I am very interested observer and I am also a student who is very interested in science and astronomy. I am not quite sure that I saw what I saw and I am not sure of the exact details. But I was taken by surprise when I saw the object and it seemed to be something not ordinary. It seemed to float in the air and had a pale blue glow around it. It did not make any noise that I recall. That is about all I can say about what I saw. I did not get a closer look as the object went off very rapidly in a zig-zag pattern which was quite unusual.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
I have not told anyone about this, as I was not sure what I saw and did not want to appear foolish. I am just giving you this information in case it helps in your study.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a comprehensive explanation of your sighting:

The object I saw had no colored lights.
The object appeared to be roughly spherical, much greater in apparent size than a B-52 or other well known aircraft at the same distance. The motion of the object could not be described as normal powered flight or gliding. It had a sort of floating, drifting motion. The object seemed to be under intelligent control, as it would alter its course and/or speed quite abruptly. The report could not be compared to any known aircraft or other object. The object was much larger than any conventional aircraft, and showed no visible means of propulsion, wings, tail surfaces, etc.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a declassified government investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States.

The text in the document is as follows:

Mrs Burt/Saporito/232142/11 Jun 65

Dear Mr. ---

Reference is made to your letter reporting your observation of aerial objects which you could not identify. The following evaluations are presented in regard to your sighting of 13 April 1965. 

1. The observation of 13 April 1965 has characteristics consistent with that of conventional jet aircraft which were probable in the area at that time.

2. The sighting of 29 April 1965 contained information that the object/phenomenon was observed for approximately 8-10 minutes. The description and duration of the flight is consistent with the observation of a conventional jet aircraft.

3. The sighting of 1 May 1965 from 9:15 to 9:50 PM is consistent with the observation of aircraft operating at night, such as training flights or military jet aircraft.

In conclusion, the nature of the observations did not indicate the presence of any unusual or unidentified aerial phenomenon. Rather, the evidence suggests the sightings were of conventional aircraft operating in the area at the time of the observations.

Sincerely,

Dan Lewis, Illinois, 60-555

28 MAY 1965

SUBJECT: UFO Observations, 13 Apr - 5 May 65, Oak Lawn, Illinois

TO: RQ USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
Washington, D.C. 20330

1. REFERENCE the attached letter from reporting 
unidentified flying objects. The following evaluations have 
been made concerning the various observations reported by the 
observer:

a. The observation of 13 Apr 65 has characteristics normally 
associated with balloons or as low flying aircraft, small 
kites.

b. The sighting of 29 Apr 65 contained a statement that the 
object was moving quite slowly; however, the duration was reported 
as erratic. The object was reported to be larger than a normal 
aircraft and to change direction at times.

c. The sightings of 1 May from 9:12 pm to 9:50 pm are consistent 
with the observation of satellites. The objects sighted are the same 
as PI-A and the Planet MARS. Both of these are astronomical objects 
and in the observed time of the observation are at the expected position.

d. The observations at 7:47 pm and 10:09 pm are similar to 
reports of satellites or satellites remanents. It is likely that he observed 
one of the other satellites or an aircraft.

2. It is suggested that a Fact Sheet be forwarded to Mr [REDACTED].

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from an old document, which appears to be part of a Project Blue Book UFO report. As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

IOT FLIGHT FORCES
This occurred to some object in the sky. It appeared to increase in size and brightness, then to become dimmer and smaller. It was observed for approximately thirty seconds, during which time its position did not change appreciably. The observed speed of any motion and the changes in apparent size and brightness were very slow. No sound was heard.

The witness stated that this object was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any conventional aircraft. It was also definitely not a meteor, star, planet, or any natural astronomical object. He called it a "flying saucer" and stated that it was definitely an "unidentified flying object" or UFO.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report from 1965. The page consists mostly of text that has been redacted or obscured, with the exception of a postmark stamp in the bottom right corner.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten or typed document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will attempt to transcribe the text found in the document:

[ILLEGIBLE] REPORT FROM PROJECT BLUE BOOK
**CONFIDENTIAL** 
THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED AS DISC-SHAPED AND HOVERING OVER A HEAVILY WOODED AREA. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 75 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE BLUE AND GREEN LIGHTS AROUND THE PERIMETER. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE MOVED RAPIDLY UPWARDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION OBSERVED. SEVERAL WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT AND THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE CONSISTENT. NO FURTHER DETAILS WERE PROVIDED. THE INCIDENT IS LISTED AS **UNIDENTIFIED**.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The image shows a form with various fields, including Date-Time Group, Location, Source, Number of Objects, Length of Observation, Type of Observation, Course, Photos, and Physical Evidence. The form is filled out with handwritten notes, but the text is too illegible for me to transcribe.

AT FLYING OBJECTS OBSERVED by USAF PERSONNEL 
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
The personnel reporting this incident are considered reliable and their observations creditable. The sightings occurred over a 2-hour period during which time several objects were observed maneuvering in the sky.

AT APPROXIMATELY 0950Z, 12 April 1965, THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE:

A round, brilliant white light, approximately the size of a nickel at arm's length, was observed by the observers in the eastern sky travelling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, during which time it appeared to suddenly increase in size, the light became more intense, and the object appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. It made no sound.

APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES LATER, at least four, possibly five, similar objects were observed in the eastern sky, travelling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. The objects were round and brilliant white in color. They were observed for 4 to 5 minutes, during which time they appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. They made no sound.

APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR LATER, a single round, brilliant white light was observed in the southwestern sky, travelling in a southwesterly direction at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. It was observed for 1 to 2 minutes, during which time it appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. It made no sound.

APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES LATER, two bright, round, brilliant white lights were observed in the eastern sky, travelling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. They were observed for 2 to 3 minutes, during which time they appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. They made no sound.
