The image appears to be a black and white photograph depicting the side view of a vehicle, likely an older model. The vehicle has a distinctive, curved shape and appears to be somewhat damaged or worn. There is a dark strip or line running along the side of the vehicle. The photograph seems to have been taken from a low angle, capturing the side profile of the vehicle.

LOCATION Covington, Kentucky

DATE-TIME GROUP 2 July 1967

SUBJECT Unidentified Flying Object

CONCLUSIONS: The object observed was a meteor or bolide. No further evaluation is possible since no motion picture or still photographs were obtained.

DETAILS:
1. The object was first sighted at 2150 EST on 2 July 1967 by several witnesses in the Covington, Kentucky, area. It was described as a bright green object that moved rapidly across the sky and exploded.
2. The witness, JOHN DOE, reported that the object was first seen as a bright green light that grew in size as it approached. It then exploded, throwing off fragments that continued on for a short distance before disappearing.
3. The duration of the sighting was approximately 10 to 15 seconds. No motion picture or still photographs were obtained.
4. Based on the witness description, the object was most likely a meteor or bolide (a very bright meteor). No further evaluation is possible since no physical evidence was obtained.

The image shows what appears to be a handheld viewfinder or camera viewer of some kind. It has a rectangular frame with a black border and a glass or transparent window in the center. The device appears to be resting on a surface, possibly a table or desk, and the background is blurry, suggesting the image was taken in a controlled environment.
