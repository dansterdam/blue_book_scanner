I am a City Patrolman - Craig Public Dept - Craig Co to
Office. Walking and I were on our way to my home
after he relieved me. at 3:34 we seen an object
apparently flying into or to somewhere in a
northerly direction - a few minutes later at 3:45 AM
I was halting my dog out could see I looked into the
far down sky, I observed a blue green flashing
light - it seemed to be traveling from South to
North and flashing about every 6 seconds - there
was only darkness between flashes - no haze at all.
I watched the flashing light for a time and then
with the time to get my binoculars - I called the
State Patrol Dispatch also and returned to the point
to find what I could not relocate the lights.

CRAIG, COLORADO.

SIRS,
I AM A CITY PATROLMAN HERE IN CRAIG COLORADO IN THE COUNTY OF MOFFAT.
I WAS COMING HOME FROM DUTY AT 3:34 AM ON THE MORNING OF JULY 29 1963
AND SEEN AN OBJECT BURN UP ON ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE, WHILE TRAVELING
IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. THE FLAMES WERE BLUEISH GREEN AND VERY BRIGHT.
I MADE NOTE OF THE TIME. IN THE EVENT THAT A FIRE MIGHT FOLLOW IN ONE
OF THE SURROUNDING NATIONAL FORESTS, OR IN THE EVENT OF A MISSING
PLANE? SO ON.
AT 3:48AM I WAS PUTTING MY DOG OUT AND AS I STOOD LOOKING INTO THE
PRE-DAWN SKY I OBSERVED AN OBJECT OR RATHER THE FLASHING LIGHT FROM
AN OBJECT ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER HEAD AND TRAVELING IN A NORTHERLY
DIRECTION. THE LIGHT WAS A BLUE OR BLUE GREEN COLOR AND VERY DEFINITELY
FLASHING. I WOULD GUESS ABOUT 5 SECONDS, I WATCHED THE LIGHT
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN WENT INSIDE TO GET MY BINOCULARS,
WHEN I RETURNED I COULD NOT RELOCATE THE OBJECT.
I BELIEVE THE OBJECT TO BE A SATELLITE IN ORBIT, AS IT LOOKS MUCH
THE SAME AS THE OTHERS DID EXCEPT INSTEAD OF BEING A STEADY WHITE
LIGHT FLOAT ALONG THIS IS A PULSATING OR FLASHING LIGHT THAT
BREAKS THE DARKNESS EVERY 5 SECONDS OR SO AND IS APPARENTLY BLUE
IN COLOR.
I INTEND THIS REPORT TO BE HELPFUL AND DO NOT WANT IT TO BE TAKEN
AS A FLYING SAUCER OR HOAX REPORT.
I SHALL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR THIS LIGHT AND MAKE NOTE OF THE
TIME AND DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, UNTIL I HEAR FROM YOU.

SINCERELY,
CRAIG, COLORADO

OBJECT TRAVELING NORTH, AND WAS DEFINITELY FLASHING GREEN OR BLUE GREENISH APPEARED MUCH THE SAME AS ONE OR PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS THAT WAS TUMBLING AND COULD BE SEEN MOMENTARILY. MOSTLY HOWEVER I AM POSITIVE THIS OBJECT WAS FLASHING.

Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curve; line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object, when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document also contains two diagrams: one showing a curved line with angle measurements from 0° to 90°, and a compass rose, and another blank diagram for drawing the object's path.
