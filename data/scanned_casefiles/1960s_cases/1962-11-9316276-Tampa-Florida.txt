TO: DAAA
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Sighting

AFOSC (770)
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2 dated 20 July 1962 the enclosed report is
transmitted. Preliminary analysis of sighting involving an unidentified object
made by college graduate of some business interest who was discharged from
active service in the grade of Sgt. USAF, is forwarded for your information.

2. Details are in accordance with attached AFO 164-62 as follows:

a. Description of the Object: A clear white disc-like object, approximately
twice the size of a conventional aircraft, was sighted by the observer. Maintained a
static relative position for 10 to 15 minutes. Upon initial observation, the object
was stationary with no visible means of propulsion. Appeared to be metallic in
nature with no exhaust, trail, or vapor.

(1) Maneuvers: Stationary initially, then...

(2) (Text appears somewhat illegible at this point)

(3) Star-like light, at some point.

(4) Three distinct lights to form a scene.

(5) Static relative position along horizontal plane at initial
sighting, duration approximately 10 to 15 minutes. No change in size, and duration
controlled by observer.

(6) No other distinguishing features noticed.

(7) No tail, trail, or exhaust visible.

(8) Relatively well-lighted but no haze or mist visible relative
to object.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(g) A detailed investigation that UFO(s) were under deliberate and
complete control is still pending.

5. Description of Course of Object(s):

(1) While seated on the front porch of their home, observers
were looking at the unusually clear sky, watching miscellaneous movements
of lights, aircraft, etc. when attention was drawn to an unusual aerial
movement which appeared to be UFO(s) which maintained and actions held their interest.

(2) First observed approximately 200° above horizon, approaching
from NE (1 to 2 o'clock position), approaching (as well as larger) in straight
path toward viewers, gaining elevation to about 45° above horizon where
"hover" occurred.

(3) From hover position (1 to 2 o'clock/40° elevation), object(s)
turned an apparent 90° left from their direction of approach, decreasing in
size, intensity, and elevation until lost within the sky's background
toward the southeast from turn-point at 20° clay. Relative altitude
at disappearance was approximately 3 - 4 ? clock position.

(4) Approaching visible from one o'clock/200 - 250 directly toward
viewer during 3 - 4 minutes, then hovering for an approximate 3 - 5 minutes
of time at 1 o'clock/45° elev. Then moving toward SE at 1 o'clock/30° elev,
irregular "bouncy" motion, decreased at 3 - 4 o'clock/20° elevation,
and at 4 o'clock lost from view. Apparent size and light intensity
throughout observation fairly constant.

(5) Briefly (3-4 minutes) in southeasterly direction toward
viewers, 1-4 o'clock position. Ascending movement noted throughout
period.

(6) Total time estimated between 11 to 13 minutes.

6. Manner of Observation:

(1) Ground - visual. (20/20 vision, observer and wife).
(2) No optical aids available, or used.
(3) Observer in fixed position on ground.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:

(1) 16/02022 November, 1962.
(2) Night, unusually clear, with no restrictions to visibility.

e. Location of Observer(s): 29°25'N, 82°22'W.

f. Identifying Information on Observer(s):

3. Weather and Wind Conditions:

(1) Unusually clear night, all stars and movement in the sky were vividly apparent. No clouds, fog, or other restrictions to visibility.

(2) McDill AFB weather records surface - 160°/13, 5,000' - 340°/10, 
10,000' - 250'/16, 20,000' - 240°/36, 30,000' - 230°/40, 50,000' - 260°/40.

k. Position: this comments of preparing officer, Assistant Base Operations Officer, Major Jack H. Bond, observer is considered to be completely believable in his sighting. Of will above average intelligence and background. He will supplement to render conclusions consistent with sound judgment and clarity. He obviously sighted some unusual and extraordinary phenomenon which is beyond our capabilities to explain. Consultation with local FAA, ARTC, AROWN manual, Weather, and Navigational agencies reveals no explanation for the nature of identity of the sighting.

Dear Captain Henry:

This will confirm by telephone conversation with you a few moments ago in relation to the unusual light phenomena which I witnessed this past Saturday evening at approximately 9:00 P.M.

The light was of such unusual proportions that it is my opinion that it was no ordinary explanation of some known investigation or part of the proper agency within our government.

While sitting on an open front porch facing the East, my wife and I witnessed a strange aerial shooting object that appeared to be in the Northeast. This object appeared to move two or three times across the sky in an erratic manner still we could not definitely classify its movement. We are certain that they were at a complete stop as I related them in the sky at rest. In my first report, I described the objects as stationary. After that length of time, the objects in the direction of the Southeast. The objects no longer were fixed in the direction of the Southeast. Two objects, but varied slightly to the distance between each other as they were in that direction. They were obviously three different objects. They not only were stationary at approximate towers as they flew, but they in a completely stationary manner would suddenly eject to bounce up and down some what as they varied the distance between each other. They were positively amazed.

Our farm is situated on State Road 581 in Pasco County midway between Dade City and Zephyrhills and Dade City.

If it should be within your power to offer some explanation, we certainly would appreciate hearing from you.

Very truly,

Dear Captain Henry:

This will confirm my telephone conversation with you a few moments ago with relation to the unusual sight that my wife and I witnessed this past Saturday evening at approximately 9:00 P. M.

This sight was of such unusual proportions that it is my opinion that it does demand some explanation and some thought and some investigation on the part of the proper agency within our government.

While sitting on an open front porch facing the East, my wife and I witnessed several shooting stars. We suddenly observed what appeared to be an airplane flying at an extremely high altitude approaching our house out of the Northeast. This object appeared to have extremely wing-lights and one light in the center. We continued to assume the object to be an airplane until we suddenly realized that it was no longer moving. The three lights came to a complete stop in the middle of the sky. I know that they were at a complete stop as I related them in the sky to a post on my front porch and observed in this manner for approximately five minutes. After that length of time, the three lights started moving at an extremely high speed in the direction of the Southeast. The lights no longer were fixed in position in relation to the other two lights, but varied slightly in the distance between each other as they flew in that direction. They were obviously three different objects, but they were maintaining an approximate formation as they flew. They did not fly in a completely straight line as an airplane would fly, but they seemed to bounce up and down some what as they varied the distance between each other. They were out of sight in approximately three to five minutes. We were positively amazed.

Our farm is situated on S in Pasco County midway between Brooksville and Dade City.

If it should be within your power to offer some explanation, we certainly would appreciate hearing from you.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) Sighting

TO: AFSC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2 dated 20 July 1962 the ensuing report is submitted. Preliminary analysis of sound confirms that the observer - a mature, stable college graduate of sound judgment, sighted some unusual phenomenon which is beyond the scope of this headquarters to satisfactorily explain.

2. Basis data in accordance with paragraph 14, AFR 200-2 follows:

a. Description of the Object(s): A cluster of three "second magnitude", star-like lights which, on approach and during "hovering" maintained a stable relative horizontal formation. Upon departure after hovering, relative positions changed in a "bouncing" manner, as phenomenon increased in distance with decreased intensity, from the observer, to ultimately merge into the starry environment of the sky.

(1) Although an unusually clear night, no specific shape configuration could be established.

(2) UFO(s) graduated in subtended size from approximately that of a pin head to the head of a match (at arms length) from initial sighting 20° above horizon, through approach and hovering (about 450 above horizon). Departure variation was substantially similar; all references were corroborated by observer's wife.

(3) Star-like light, of second magnitude order.

(4) Three distinct lights, to form a cluster (formation).

(5) Stable relative positions along horizontal plane at initial sighting, during approach - with an apparent increase in size, and during "sighted" period. Upon departure, relative positions changed in irregularly-controlled manner.

(6) No other distinguishing features visible.

(7) No tail, trail, or exhaust visible.

(8) Relatively still night; but no sound or noise audible relative to sighting.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(9) A definite impression that UFO(s) were under deliberate and complete control at all times.

b. Description of Course of Object(s):
(1) While seated on the front porch of their ranch home, observer and his wife were looking at the unusually clear sky. Perceptible movements of lights, stars, etc., were vividly apparent. Their attention was drawn to the approach of UFO(s), whose movement and actions held their interest.

(2) First observed approximately 20° above horizon, approaching from NE (1 to 2 o'clock position), approaching (growing larger) in straight path toward viewers, gaining elevation to about 45° above horizon where "hover" occurred.

(3) From hover position (1 to 2 o'clock/45° elevation), object(s) turned an apparent 90° left from their direction of approach, decreasing in size, intensely, and leaving until lost with sky's background (toward the southeast from turn-point, at 20° elev.). Relative azimuth at disappearance was approximately 3 - 4 o'clock to original sighting.

(4) Approaching visibly from one o'clock/20° alev directly toward viewer during 3 - 4 minutes, then hovering for an appreciable 3 - 5 minutes of time at 1 o'clock/45° elev, then moving toward UFO(s) southeast in an irregular "bouncy" formation. Disappeared at 3 - 4 o'clock/20° elevation, merging with background of the sky. Relative size, elevations, and light intensities corroborated description of flight path.

(5) Rapidly (3-5 minutes) in southeasterly direction, toward viewers 3-4 o'clock position. Assuming observer facing North throughout period.

(6) Total time estimated between 11 to 15 minutes.

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground - visual. (20/20 vision, observer and wife).
(2) No optical aids available, or used.
(3) Observer in fixed position on ground.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) 18/0200Z November, 1962.

I wish that some professional observer could have the opportunity to see these objects. May I point out that this past Saturday night, April 13, we were again out clear skies with hundreds of normalized stars in the heavens. We saw only two movie stars this time instead of three. They look for all the world like a fixed star in the sky.

From a patriotic point of view, I should like to have a trained observer witness these flying stars, but this would be for you to decide.

Dear Mr. Byrek:

Your correspondence will reveal that you wrote to me on January
7, 1963, requesting me to provide additional details, in the
sky. You asked that I provide additional details, or else photo
collective to your time. I attempted to telephone today, but I was
told that you were out of the state. After delaying my call for
three and a half months, I decided a letter would suffice. I some
time ago moved from Albuquerque, New Mexico, but I decided to write.

I hope you have the file to my original report to the Air Force.
I have not recovered your original request for more information
simply because I fell inadequate to explain the circumstances beyond my original report. I find that it is difficult to be articulate in describing the details.

I am now prompted by the fact that my wife and I again saw the
same "stars" in the same part of the sky, at approximately the
same time, while sitting on the same front porch.

Frankly, we had almost forgotten about the matter and it was continued occasional chat. However, again, we saw this after house
at night only every fourth week or so, and then only for a Saturday
night.

These "stars" may be present every night for I do not know, because
I have not tried to observe, but last we saw these "stars" are
not stars, but are unidentified flying objects that demand some
explanation.
