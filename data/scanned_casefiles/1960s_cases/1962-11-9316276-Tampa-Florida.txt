Base Information Officer

Tampa, Florida

Dear Captain Henry:

This will confirm my telephone conversation with you a few days ago relative to the unusual sightings of unidentified flying objects that my wife and I witnessed.

This sight was of such unusual proportions that it is my opinion that the sighting should be made a matter of record on the part of the proper agency within our government.

As you know, we were driving along the highway near our home when suddenly we observed what appeared to be several shooting stars, stationary hovering above the horizon out of the Northeast. This object appeared to have two exterior lights - a red light on the top and a green light on the bottom. The object then came to a complete stop in the middle of the sky. After that length of time, the three bright lights went out completely. After that length of time, the three bright lights came to a complete stop. After that length of time, the three bright lights went out completely. After that length of time, the three bright lights came to a complete stop. After that length of time, the three bright lights went out completely. 

We were positively amazed.

If it should be within your power to offer some explanation, we would appreciate hearing from you.

Very truly yours,
FLS/bb

A 30 July 1962 report dated 20 July 1962 the ensuing was submitted. Preliminary analysis confirms that the observer's description constitutes an observation of an object which is beyond the scope of this headquarters to satisfactorily explain.

1. Details of observation in accordance with paragraph 14, AFR 200-2, dated 20 November 1959, submitted:
a. Description of the Object(s): A cluster of three "second-statile lights" which appeared and disappeared from view. Relative horizontal formation. Upon departure after hovering for a period, the objects separated suddenly and flew off into the starry environment of the sky.
(1) An unusual clear night, no specific shape could be established.
(2) UFO(s) graduated in subsided size from approximate 5 pin head to the head of a match (at arms length) from initial sighting to departure beyond horizon, this confirmed by observer's wife.
(3) Intermittent light, of second magnitude order.
(4) Three distinct lights, to form a cluster (formation)
(5) Stable relative positions along horizontal plane at sighting, during approach - with an apparent increase in size with an associated controlled manner.
(6) No other distinguishing features visible.
(7) No trail, trail, or exhaust visible.
(8) Relatively still night, but no sound or noise audible.

(9) A definite impression that UFO(s) were under deliberate and complete control at all times.
b. Description of Course of Object(s):
(1) While seated on the front porch of their ranch home and his wife were looking at the unusual clarity of the sky, stars, etc., they were vividly apparent - their attention was drawn to the approach of UFO(s), whose movement and actions held their interest.
From NE (2) observer first observed approximately 200 yards horizon, approximately 1000-1200 feet elevation, moving from 90 degrees toward 270 degrees, about 45-60 seconds.
(3) Hover position (1 to 2 o'clock/45° elevation) turned an apparent 90° left from their direction of approach, descending and remaining at 200-300 feet elevation, observed during 3-4 minutes, then hovering for an appreciable period of time at 1 o'clock/45° position, then moving toward UFO(s) and ascending in approximately 60 seconds to an estimated 800-1000 feet, merging with background of the sky. Relative size, elevation, intelligible speed and movements impressed the observers.
Viewers (5) Rapidly (3-5 minutes) in southeasterly direction, appearing larger view during 3-4 minutes, then hovering for an appreciable period of time at 1 o'clock/45° position, then moving toward UFO(s) and ascending in approximately 60 seconds to an estimated 800-1000 feet, merging with background of the sky. Relative size, elevation, intelligible speed and movements impressed the observers.
c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground - visual. (20/20 vision, observer and wife)
(3) Observer in fixed position on ground.
d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) 18/2002Z November, 1962.

Mr. D. Allen Byrne
2922 Lakeview Drive
Tampa, Florida

April 3. 1962

I wish to take this opportunity to comment on an incident which I, as a flight observer, could have the proper identification of, if I had been able to obtain a photograph of the object.

On the evening of March 31, 1962, at approximately 8:50 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, I observed a bright light, an object similar in size to a starlike object, traveling in a northeast direction at a great rate of speed. This object gave off a bluish-white light, seemed to be spinning and momentarily disappeared behind a tree. Upon reappearance, it maintained a steady course for about 10 to 15 seconds, then suddenly disappeared. This sighting lasted approximately 30 to 40 seconds.

I am aware of the fact that a number of unidentified sightings have occurred lately in the Tampa Bay area, and hope that my report will be of some value. If additional information is required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,
[Signature]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or letter from the "TAMPA, FLORIDA" company, dated April 17, 1962. The text describes an unidentified flying object report and discusses the difficulties in obtaining clear photographs of the object. The document mentions "these 'stars' may be present every night for a period of time" and that the sightings are "being observed - said those only".

APRIL 17, 1962

Mr. G. Allen Hynek, Director
Geophysical Research Corporation 
620 N. Michigan Avenue
Evanston, Illinois

DEAR MR. HYNEK:

Your letter o April 13th, 1962, to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base regarding "UFO" sightings, has been referred to us for comment.  

The observation you referred to on April 5th by the Illinois pilot and his passenger, matches the observations reported to us from Tampa, Florida. As you realize, it is difficult to obtain clear photographs to substantiate these reports, due to the high altitudes of the objects and other factors such as haze, obscured vision, etc.

I hope you have the film of the original report to the United States Air Force to cover this sighting. We are promptly forwarding copies of this report to ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, for their investigation and analysis.

As to the report from Tampa, Florida - this is a continuing report and it is difficult to get the public interested in "flying objects" - unless of course they are making contact with the same. It seems that these "stars" may be present every night for a period of time, and are being observed - said those only.

These "stars" may be present every night for a period of time, and are being observed - said those only. This has created some skepticism - as you can imagine.

I am now prompted by the fact that your letter has been referred to us, to give you our observations and findings to date.

I hope you have the file on the original report to the United States Air Force to cover this sighting. We are promptly forwarding copies of this report to ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, for their investigation and analysis.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
Director
