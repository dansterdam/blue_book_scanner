ATTN OF: AFCIN-4X2

SUBJECT: Extract from Duty Officer's Report

TO: AFCIN-4X2 (Major Friend)

The following, extracted from Capt  Report dated 24 Jun is quoted for your information:

"This UFO is report received by the ATIC OD at 2140 hours, 24 June local time by the ATIC OD.

"This is a report of an object, fairly brilliant, traveling swiftly near Bermuda, at 0900 25 June, seven sightings in all. It appeared as a light, yellow, not as yellow as but brighter than a star. It seemed to drop at times and then ascend at 16 to 18 thousand feet, at one point dropping to about 6 to 8 thousand feet. Its speed, for three to five minutes, seemed to climb at extremely fast speed."
