CINCINNATI ENQUIRER
17 November 1960

New "What's It?"
Crosses Our Sky

Greater Cincinnati was
treated to a another celestial,
big brief, aerial exhibition
last night.

A bright sphere studded by
a red tail sailed across the
sky at about 5:15 p.m.,
creating a stir among residents in Madisonville, Mt.
Carmel, Mt. Healthy, Milford, Fairmont, and Cumminsville.

Callers told The Enquirer
the display was visible only
for seconds, but was of intense brilliance.

A representative of the
Cincinnati Underwriters Exchange, Joseph Rossman Group,

said last night's occurrence
might fall into "astronomical
phenomena," according to
Leonard H. Stringfield,
local, is president of the
Civilian Saucer Investigating Group and said he
was not the source, but he
was aware of the occurrence.

Stringfield has estimation on
the description, he said:
"It was definitely an object."

Stringfield said he has
received reports of unusual
sightings from residents of
Greater Cincinnati for the
last four nights.

Last night's event was
the latest in recent interest
here. In five days, the
northern lights were seen
temporarily, while on
another occasion a fireball
was seen flashing across
the heavens and was visible in four states.

The only somewhat discernible marks are a few faint symbols or letters, including what looks like a "W" and a triangular shape, but these are not clear enough to confidently transcribe.
