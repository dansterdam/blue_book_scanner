PROJECT 10073 RECORD

2. LOCATION: Miamisburg, Ohio

10. CONCLUSION: Possible: AIRCRAFT

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: see report

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: South

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observed sighted an object that was similar in appearance to a star. The object went in a southerly direction and disappeared behind the observers house. No noise was heard.

Comments: The observer initially reported to the Duty Officer that the sighting took place on 23 Nov 67 and that he saw the phenomenon for 10 seconds. He was later sent a Form 117 in which he stated that he saw it on 3 Nov 67 and that it was in sight for 5 minutes. The description of the object is consistent with that of an airplane with its landing lights. Miamisburg is not far from Dayton Planes from Wright-Patterson, and would have been in the area.
