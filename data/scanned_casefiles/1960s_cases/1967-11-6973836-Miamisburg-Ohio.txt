PROJECT 10073 RECORD
2. LOCATION: Miamisburg, Ohio
10. CONCLUSION: Possible: AIRCRAFT
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers reported that the object was similar in appearance to a southerly direction and disappeared behind the observers' house. No noise was heard.
COMMENTS: The observers initially reported to the Dayton Office officer that the sighting took place on 23 Nov 67 and that he may have been able to get a front view of the object if it had not disappeared behind their house. It was in sight for 5 minutes and the description of the object indicates that it was silent, conformed to the size of a craft that they have seen before, and would have been in the area.
