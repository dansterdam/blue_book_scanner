23 APR 1968

Dear [redacted]

Your letter dated April 10, 1968, addressed to U. S. Air Force Special Investigations, St. Louis, Missouri, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) has been forwarded to this office for reply.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually is more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
