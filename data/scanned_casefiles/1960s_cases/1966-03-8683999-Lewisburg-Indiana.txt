K. STAFF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER CHIEF COMBAT INTELLIGENCE. MRS. [REDACTED] STATED THAT PREVIOUS TO THIS SIGHTING SHE DID NOT BELIEVE IN UFOS AND IN FACT RIDICULED SUCH REPORTS. SHE FURTHER STATED SHE DOES NO KNOW WHAT THE OBJECT WAS, BUT SHE IS CONVINCED BEYOND ANY DOUBT THAT SHE SAW SOMETHING. ALTHOUGH SHE WAS AFRAID, SHE SAID SHESHOULD NOT PANIC BUT ACTED WITH REASONABLE AND NORMAL RESPONSE. SINCE MRS. [REDACTED] WORKS IN AN ENVIRONMENT REQUIRING STABILITY DURING EMERGENCIES, SHE PROBABLY REACTED IN A SIMILAR MANNER ON THIS OCCASION. DURING THE INVESTIGATION SHE REMAINED CALM AND COOPERATIVE.

THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING.
