Case 16: This case is representative of several we've had during the year in that although the motion is satellite-like, identification with a known satellite has not been made. Committee is worried about the existence of too many of these cases and wonders why, since SPADATS is in existence and many millions of dollars are spent yearly on tracking all satellites, SPADATS can't make positive identification of these cases. Why not?

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns of numerical data, dated from March 16-21, 1963. The columns seem to include time, latitude, longitude, and other numerical measurements. Some text at the top of the page is partially illegible. The document appears to be related to satellite tracking or positioning data.]

The top of the page contains some header text, but it is too blurry to confidently transcribe. The main body of the document consists of numerical data tables with dates from March 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, 1963, with columns labeled "SATELLITE" and what appears to be positioning or tracking information.
