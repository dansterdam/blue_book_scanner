Your report is similar to many other reports of aircraft using electric lights either on the aircraft itself or on a towed target for advertising purposes. Your report has been placed in the category of aircraft with advertising lights.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Sir:

My name is [redacted], I am 17 years old and as of Aug. 20, 1965 believe in UFOs and flying saucers. Let me explain further. On the above night my brother [redacted] and I were in our backyard looking for meteorous from the predicted shower from the Perseus. However, during the two hours we were outside from 9-11 PM EDT, we saw six unidentified flying objects. The drawings enclosed are from 80-90% accurate and so is the one altitude reading of the light formation. Both my brother and I know an airplane or jet when we see or hear one. We heard absolutely no sound from these UFOs. They went too fast for balloons and there is no place around here where huge weather balloons could be launched. I beg your pardon for the map included but, I think it is necessary for the rest of the "data". In case you are wondering, I got the address of Project Blue Book from [redacted].

Both my brother and I consider ourselves good observers and we don't drink. These sightings were completely unintentional and are entirely factual. My brother and I hope that this meager report will help you and your project in solving the mystery of the UFOs.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
