Mrs Hunt/ab/SAFOICC/72842/24 Nov 65

Dear Mr ███████

If your direction of flight is correct, the object which you observed on 25 and 29 August 1965 was not a satellite. All known satellites have an easterly component in their direction of flight.

Since you observed the object on successive nights, it is more likely that the object you observed was an aircraft at a high altitude on a regularly scheduled flight.

Since you expressed an interest in satellites, I am enclosing a list of the visible satellites and space debris.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 25-29 Aug 65

TO: Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs Hunt)

Mr [redacted] requested information on Identification of an object which he assumed to be a satellite. The object was observed between 25 August and 29 August while on a trip to the Sequoia National Park. It was not consistent in direction of flight, it is likely that the object observed was not a satellite.

No known satellites have retrograde orbits. All known satellites have an easterly component in their direction of flight. Since the observation was made on succeeding nights, it is more likely that an aircraft at high altitude on a regularly scheduled flight was observed. Since no satellite was observed, we are attaching a list of the visible satellites and space debris.

Santa Ana, Calif.
September 3, 1965

Gentlemen:

While on a recent trip to Sequoia National Park, myself and five friends spotted what we believe to be a satellite.

It was sighted on Wednesday, August 25. Thursday, August 26, and Sunday, August 29, at 10:20 P.M. each night. It was moving from the south-southeast to the north-northwest and when we faced west it was from 50' to 30' above the horizon. The time was from 5 to 10 minutes and it was sighted only once an evening. The still place was on Marse Road about 1.3 miles west of the Giant Pines Village.

I am a high school senior and I am very interested in our space program. I am fascinated about the name, type, or call letters of the satellite would be a great help.

If you can not give me this information could you please tell me where I might find such information.

Sincerely yours,
