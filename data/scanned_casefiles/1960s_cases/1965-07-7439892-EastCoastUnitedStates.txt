Memo, TDEW/UFO, 23 Aug 65, Request for Radar Analysis (U)

1st Ind. (TDEW/Capt Dunlap/pk)/7420l)                   31 Aug 65

TO:    TDEW/UFO

1.  The attached memo for the record provides insufficient information to enable a radar analysis of the situation. In order to perform an analysis, it would be necessary to know the types of radars involved, their operating radio frequencies, types of signals generated, weather conditions between the radars and the indicated target, equipment location and the direction of target travel.

2.  The motion of the target appears to rule out direct observation, as natural objects would not be able to change directions radically at the observed speeds. This leads one to believe that the observations were via anomalous propagation of the radar waves. When atmospheric conditions are right, anomalous propagation can play many tricks and, of course, are difficult to substantiate. This occurrence may be one of these cases; however, additional information could prove otherwise.
