Dear [redacted]

The Air Force has attempted an evaluation of the observation you reported in your letter of October 23, 1963, and in the Technical Information Sheet subsequently forwarded to this Headquarters.

There were several inconsistencies between your letter and the Form 164. In your letter you stated the objects were reported as west, while on the completed Form the direction indicated was to the east. Also, in your letter you indicated speeds slower than meteors and comparable to aircraft. In the Form you indicated the estimated speed as 200 mph for the two objects. Further, in your letter the flight of the two objects was reported to be west, while the objects finally striking below the horizon. In the completed Form, the motion of the objects was given as southeast. As a result, this sighting has been listed in a category of "Conflicting Data" and requires this evaluation.

As a possible solution to the observation, based on the assumption that the information supplied in your letter was correct and the reported time of sighting was in error by two hours, it may be assumed that you witnessed the setting Antares between 7-710 p.m., local time. Antares was just above the horizon at 2259 azimuth and Mars in a similar position at 234Â° azimuth. These astronomical bodies had a magnitude of -1.3 and -1.7 respectively. If you observed these as described, the description of your sighting would conform with this analysis.

SUBJECT:    UFO Sighting (New Hampton, New Hampshire)

TO:         Hq USAF SAFOI-PB (Mrs Gaiser)
            Wash 25 D C

1.    The following information is provided to assist you in a reply
to Mr.                 regarding an object which he sighted on 23 Oct 63.

2.    A letter was received from                 with several bits of
conflicting information and a form 164 was sent to him for com-
pletion. The completed form was returned, however, there are still
several inconsistencies in the information that he has provided.

    a. In his letter of 23 October 1963, the direction in which
the objects were sighted was reported as West, while on the completed
form the direction indicated was to the East.

    b. In his letter he indicates speeds slower than meteors and
considers the speeds comparable to a/c. In the completed form he
estimated the speed at 200 MPH, yet the arc distance traveled was
less than 15 degrees in 15 minutes.

    c. In his letter the direction of flight of the two objects
was reported to the West with the objects finally sinking below the
horizon. In the completed form the motion of the objects was given
as Southeast.

3.    The sighting has been placed in the Other (Conflicting
Data) category and carrying this evaluation, as a possible solution
we can offer an explanation of the sighting based on these assumptions:

    a. Information supplied in the letter is correct and that given
on the form is erroneous.

    b.                 reported time of the sighting (1C70ST) was in
error by two hours.

4.    Accepting the above assumptions the case could be evaluated as the
setting of Antares and Mars. Between 1900-1910 Antares was just above
the horizon at 225 degrees azimuth and Mars in a similar position at


- page 9 -

234 degrees azimuth. These astronomical bodies had a magnitude of 4.3 and 4.7 respectively. If the description of objects at about 5 degrees elevation would conform with this analysis.

October 23, 1963

Handman,

At precisely 9:03 D.S.T. time, I was on
my way blinking yellow slowly, white, small
light, turning in the western sky, apparently
followed by an identical light. It seemed that
these were moving miles apart, though both were
several miles apart. The two, irregularly blinking
alternately moved in a westerly direction and
gradually sunk over the horizon. At times, they
seemed almost one orange-white. Having
little markers before, I am certain there were
velocity other than apparent. But of a nature
that they have been a surprise - the color
remained at one location on the sky and
remained a pure color - not fire, very orange.

Please do not consider any report
as or of an element in prejudice. They study
time as valuable, but being unbelievable in accuracy
I tell it very clearly to make this significant. Please
address me. New Hampton, N.H.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature and communication dept blacked out]
