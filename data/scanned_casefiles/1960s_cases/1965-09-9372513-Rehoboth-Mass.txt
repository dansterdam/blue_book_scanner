11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object looked like a long tube. Object had a blue and red band at the rear. Looked like it was giving off yellow sparks. Observed it for a few seconds while driving a car.

Report is very messy and disorganized. It gives the feeling that the observer is of low intellect. She states that she is very enthused with "sky objects"

The cause of the sighting could have been an aircraft possibly an aircraft with advertising sign. It might have been a meteor. There is nothing in the report to indicate anything other than a misinterpretation of some conventional object or natural phenomena.

There are some additional handwritten notes and annotations on the page, but some are partially illegible or difficult to fully transcribe with complete certainty.

The document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram with various notes related to a UFO sighting in Rehoboth, Massachusetts in August/September 1963.

Furthermore we note the following special cases:

a) Zero frequency, ω = 0
The distribution function becomes
A_∞ = Ke^-x^2 [1 + (Ma^2/6RT) (1-γ)/y^2 (x^2 - 3/2)]   (96)

The temperature T'
T' = T[1 + 3(M/m)(a_0/a)^2] = T[1 + (Ma^2/6RT) (1-γ)/y^2]   (96a)

b) Zero frequency, zero magnetic field. We put ω = 0, Ψ = 0 so that γ = 0.
A_∞ = Ke^-x^2 [1 + (β_2/12) (M/m) (x^2 - 3/2)]   (97)
with ma_0/RTm = √(m/RTm) β_1, or β_1 = 2(a_0/a_m)

The relaxation of the anisotropies is little influenced by the movement of the ions. We may write
f = Ke^-x^2 [1 + β_1x_z + (M/m) (β_1/ε) (x^2 - 3/2) + 2/3 β_1β_2 (3z^2 - x^2)/2]

Conclusions
The distribution function was found as a development in terms of series in powers of the electric field strength. The magnetic field leads to complications involving the anisotropic terms in C_1n.

In the absence of an electric field it is possible to show clearly how an isotropic distribution is re-established; starting from an arbitrary non isotropic distribution the an isotropic distribution is attained after some relaxation processes have taken place which take a time t_0 characteristic of the order l of anisotropy. An initial isotropic distribution can be decomposed into a Maxwellian-component y_0 and non Maxwellian components y_p, p≠0 which relax with relaxation times of an order of magnitude (a/M) p t_0, i.e. much more slowly than the anisotropies.

In the presence of an electric field the anisotropies are represented by spherical functions C_l0 with amplitudes proportional to (E_0/E_m)^l   (where
