Proposed reply to Action Line ltr, dtd 5 Nov 69.

1. Reference your letter of 5 Nov 69. UFO reports should be reported as soon as possible after the sighting to the nearest Air Force base. As required by AFR 80-17, each Air Force base has a UFO investigator who undertakes an initial investigation. If the stimulus is identified at the local level, no further action need be taken. If the local investigator is unable to identify the stimulus, the report is forwarded to Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio where a more intensive investigation is undertaken.

2. investigator was forwarded to the Air Force UFO investigating officer at Chanute Air Force Base. This investigating officer completed a UFO reporting form per a telephone conversation with Mr. [redacted] on 17 Nov 69. Analysis of this information indicates that the sighting contains some internally conflicting points.

3. A partial analysis made by the local investigating officer reads as follows: "Assuming an elevation angle of 50 degrees is correct, and using a conservative estimate of 3000 feet, the object must have been approximately 1200 feet in diameter. If the object would have been suspended at 14,000 feet, a time of approximately 10 minutes from the first sighting to disappearance would be required. Using trigonometry, the object would have to be 630 feet in diameter. In view of the above description, it is difficult to even partially disappear as described."

The greatest criticism lies in the fact that apparently the object was seen simultaneously from 6 miles ESE of O'Hare Airport and 6 miles SSW of Chicago ASRY. I contacted both Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. ASRY I contacted both Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. ASRY

Dear Sir:

The enclosed requests for help have been sent to Chicago Today. The Action Line column receives over 4,000 such pleas every week. We have sifted the complaints and are sending along only those which we feel merit your attention.

In behalf of Chicago Today and of these people, we ask you give them consideration if your investigation shows that action is justified.

May we ask that you advise us of any action you take.

Sincerely,

Kenan Heise
EDITOR OF ACTION LINE

P.S. May I ask that you please return the enclosure with your reply. It helps us serve both you and the correspondent better.

and Chief Stewart of Glenview Public Affairs (Navy counter-
part of 1802), court of these men had any report of a UFO
being reported on 28 or 29 October. It seems logical to me 
that, as this thing is alleged to have been seen at 60 mph, somebody at O'Hare should have seen it.

The Chief Givinon discontinued conversation concerning velocity of the
GC:320 and time observed (stated 65 minutes in letter and
95 minutes on the telephone) warrant no further comments.

4. Also of interest is the fact that Mr. mentioned twice in his
conversation with the investigating officer that he did not observe the
moon but that the stars were quite bright. However, the moon should
have been visible since it was in the Eastern sky at about 65 degrees 
elevation at the beginning of the sighting and was nearly a full moon
(full moon Oct 25).

5. This sighting is being carried in Project Blue Book files under the
category of "Conflicting Data".

Sighting Background:
On 15 October 1969 I received a telephone call from Assistant Chairman
Francis Gogulski who stated that Investigator Charles Valentine was
conducting an investigation of a 16 October 1969 UFO sighting made by
M. 'name redacted', an Indianapolis Superior of Digital Equipment COP.
I received a letter (attached) and a signed questionnaire (attached)
from Charles Valentine on 18 October 1969. The following report is based upon this
data.

The Charles Valentine Letter:

"10-16-69

"Subject: Attached report on UFO sighting - J. LARKIN.

"My: "I'm not sure I would call to you all of the details to any case this part of interview
with J. LARKIN, However, it's not sure that the recorded in any certain."

"'I was snooping around about 4 years and would rate him as a 'interested-in-ons believer in UFO's.'"

"Informant said I got the impression he felt it was a solid object."

"He said he saw (2 or 3 times) a 'bright speck or streak' of light jump' for the rear of the subject when it was scheduled.'"

"His vision is very good and he is generally skeptical in his overall attitude toward extra-terrestrial craft/beings etc.

Cordially,
Charles Valentine"

NICAP MASS SIGHTING REPORT
1969-27/14 October 1969 (Cont'd)

Sighting Account:
On 14 October 1969, 8:40 PM EDT, Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] observed an unusual object in the sky over their home at 72 Devon Road, Chicago, Illinois. Their attention was attracted by a line of 5 or 6 "faint-like" sparking lights at an elevation of 45° in the NW which appeared to be moving upward and over a section of newly-installed power lines. He stopped his car at the Route #2 Shirley Road, got out and watched the object more closely. (A few cars passed by but did not seem to notice the strange lights). As he stood next to his car with the headlights on, the object came nearer and seemed to be surrounded by a halo or glow of light. It moved rapidly upward and as they came closer and passed directly over him it changed from the straight-line formation to a half circle moving forward and one light to the rear. (See sketch). This movement packed the 5 or 6 lights into a tight circular formation that resembled a cigarshaped object with the sparks flickering on and off. The object flew at a very high rate of speed and then vanished from sight. The total sighting duration was estimated at 5 minutes.

Sighting Evaluation:
My first thought was that perhaps a hoax cleaning garment hot-air balloon (like have been used for scientific and other type of balloon) ascents might be involved. However, the sparking candles always seem to take on an erratic, drops of a matter trail and usually its duration is shorter. My second thought was that the witness observation was significantly different than normal balloon or aircraft types. However, such (although the description would cover 2 or 3 aircraft I have seen) is aparent that no note from it was made nor conventional running lights as seen. Also, the lights maneuvering were quite large (even if exaggerated slightly) and passed in a different configuration. (Although the change and running lights would indicate an aircraft were involved). It's apparent also was quite large and seemed to be maneuvering in a way that suggests an unconventional aircraft was involved.

The text in the document is as follows:

NICAP MASS SUBSCOM Report
1969-27/14 October 1969 (Cont'd)

In the event others may have reported this objeet to the police or to news for Boston, I passed the following pleces:

Shirley Police Dept. - No reports noted on blotter.
(617/425-2577)

Harvard Police Dept. - No reports noted on blotter. Said that sometimes there are low-flying crop-dusting aircraft over local nights orcharda but that they fly only in the daylight hours.

Littleton Police Dept. - No reports noted on blotter.
(617/486-3142)

Fort Devens - I talked to various Base Operations personnel who told me that they had received no UFO reports and that no aircraft from their base were airborne at that time. They did state that sometimes during daylight hours a helicopter operating out of Albany, New York will run a low-level check on power-lines there.

Although I am tempted toward a probable-aircraft classification, the over-all data seems to rule this out. The sighting impression is taken at face value. I phoned and questioned Mr. Westover at the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena very closely and his reaction to the witness statements was extremely investigative. He said he had gone through the motions of trying to identify it with something conventional, and found that to be impossible. The witness, according to him, is sober, solid and reliable.

My evaluation is that this "sighting" should be classified as a low-weight unknown. Its presence over "lighted" powering construction is noteworthy although perhaps only accidental. The witness is considered highly reliable and has a background in constructing as well as building a report supervisory position. (See Data Sheets.)

SUBJECT: UFO Investigation

1. ... was contacted by telephone at 1900 on 17 Nov 69. He related and supplements the original letter and drawing sent by ... That he stated that the object he saw was a UFO. ... The facts, while not positively identifying the object, suggest that his story is at best, doubtful.

2. Assuming Roder's elevation angle of 50 Degrees is correct, and using the stated estimate of 1000+ feet for the object's height, then the object would have been approximately 1200 feet away. If we assume it was 1000 feet away, then it would take a basketball to cover the object along the line of sight. ... (1360 is more accurate), ... "a tree or house across the street."

3. By greatest contrast, lies in the fact that apparently no one else saw (or reported having seen) this UFO, other than Roder. This is in contrast to the reports of Office of Chicago ARTCC and Chief Stewart of Glenview Public Affairs (Navy counterpart) who stated both previously and on 23 or 25 October that some unidentified object had been tracked both visually and on radar by the Chicago ARTCC and themselves.

4. The obvious discrepancies concerning velocity of the object and time observed (stated 65 minutes in letter and 90 minutes on the telephone)...

5. In conclusion, while the investigator thought he was seeing a UFO, it is the opinion of this investigator that he was the victim of his own vivid imagination or some other natural phenomenon.

SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 7 October 1969, at approximately 1730 hours, Mr. C. A. Johnson, a civilian employee of the US Army Aviation Systems Command, St. Louis, Missouri, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Chicago, Illinois.

2. Mr. Johnson stated that while driving north on the Kennedy Expressway in Chicago, he observed a circular, metallic-appearing object hovering over the expressway. He stated the object appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground. Mr. Johnson further stated that the object hovered for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

3. An investigation of this incident was conducted by Special Agent R. H. Quintanilla of the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois. The results of this investigation are as follows:

a. Mr. Johnson's description of the object he observed was consistent with reports of similar sightings in the Chicago area.

b. No other witnesses to the sighting could be located.

c. No radar contact of the object was established by any air traffic control facility in the Chicago area.

d. No aircraft or other known aerial vehicles were operating in the vicinity at the time of the sighting.

4. Based on the available information, this incident is classified as "Unidentified."

REPORT DATA:
Project Blue Book Report

DESCRIPTION

This unusual report came in from a civilian observer in Chicago, Illinois on October 7, 1969. The witness stated that they observed a bright, disc-shaped object in the sky which appeared to be slowly descending. The object then allegedly released several smaller objects which drifted away. 

No physical evidence or corroborating witness reports were obtained to substantiate the claim. The case was classified as "Insufficient Information" and filed without further analysis.

The image contains three sketches or drawings rather than any photographs. The top left sketch appears to show a starry night sky or cloud patterns. The top right sketch depicts a landscape with hills or mountains. The bottom sketch shows various geometric shapes and patterns, possibly representing some kind of topographic or terrain map.

Text from the document:

The hills were very high and varied in shape. They appeared to extend in a South East direction. The landscape was covered with a definite pattern of markings which were reminiscent of contour lines on a topographic map, but they did not conform to any known terrain features. The markings appeared to be produced by some kind of energy disturbance rather than normal geologic processes.

The entire area was illuminated by a diffused glow of light which came from no apparent source. The light appeared to emanate from the ground itself. There was no horizon visible, only the mountainous terrain extending in all directions.
