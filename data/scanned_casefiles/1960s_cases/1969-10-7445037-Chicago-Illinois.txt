6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE FIRST SIGHTING OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. HERETO, IF YOU WILL, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE "A" AND "B" POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

Proposed reply to Action Line ltr, dtd 5 Nov 69.

1. Reference your letter of 5 Nov 69. UFO reports should be reported as soon as possible after the sighting to the nearest Air Force base. As required by AFR 80-17, each Air Force base has a UFO investigator who undertakes an initial investigation. If the stimulus is identified at the local level, no further action need be taken. If the local investigator is unable to identify the stimulus, the report is forwarded to Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio where a more intensive investigation is undertaken.

2. [Redacted] letter was forwarded to the Air Force UFO investigating officer at Chanute Air Force Base. This investigating officer completed a UFO reporting form per a telephone conversation with Mr. [Redacted] on 17 Nov 69. Analysis of this information indicates that [Redacted] sighting contains some internally conflicting points.

3. A partial analysis made by the local investigating officer reads as follows:

"Assuming [Redacted] elevation angle of 50 degrees is correct, and using a conservative estimate of 1000 feet to Four residential blocks (136°), 1s more accurate), than the object would have been approximately 1200' in the air. If we accept [Redacted] statement that it would take a baseball to cover the object along the line of sight, that by trigonometry the object would have to be 630 feet in diameter. It is virtually impossible for an object acting the above description to even partially disappear behind a 'tree or house across the street.'"

"The greatest criticism lies in the fact that apparently [Redacted] saw the object. [Redacted] residence is approximately 6 miles SSE of O'Hare Int'l Airport and 6 miles S of Glenview NAS. I contacted both Mr. Meely of Chicago ARTC"

Dear Sir:

The enclosed requests for help have been sent to Chicago Today. The Action Line column receives over 4,000 such pleas every week. We have sifted the complaints and are sending along only those which we feel merit your attention.

In behalf of Chicago Today and of these people, we ask you give them consideration if your investigation shows that action is justified.

May we ask that you advise us of any action you take.

Sincerely,
Kenan Heise
EDITOR OF ACTION LINE

P.S. May I ask that you please return the enclosure with your reply. It helps us serve both you and the correspondent better.

and Chief Stewart of Glenview Public Affairs (Navy counter-
part of 150). Neither or these men had any record of a UFO
being reported on 23 or 29 October. It seems logical to me
that if this large object had passed over [illegible] roof, head-
ing West at 60 mph, somebody at O'Hare should have seen it.

"The obvious discrepancies concerning velocity of the
object and time observed (stated 65 minutes in letter and
30 minutes on the telephone) warrant no further comment."

4. Also of interest is the fact that [illegible] mentioned twice in his
conversation with the investigating officer that he did not observe the
moon but that the stars were quite bright. However, the moon should
have been visible since it was in the Eastern sky at about 65 degrees
elevation at the beginning of the sighting and was nearly a full moon
(full moon Oct 25).

5. This sighting is being carried in Project Blue Book files under the
category of "Conflicting Data".

Sighting Background:

On 15 October 1969 I received a telephone call from Assistant Chairman Francis Pechulis who informed me that Investigator Charles Valentine was conducting an investigation of a 14 October 1969 sighting made by Mr. ________ an Engineering Supervisor at Digital Equipment Corp. Mr. ________ is employed. On 15 October Charles interviewed the witness. I received a letter (attached) and a signed questionnaire (attached) from Charles on 18 October 1969. The following report is based upon this data.

The Charles Valentine Letter:

                                                        "10-16-69

"Subject: Attached report on UFO sighting - J. LARKIN.

"Ray:

"Taped part of interview with ________. However, I'm not sure tape will be of any interest to you - will have to transcribe onto my other tape recorder in any case.

"I've known ________ for the last 4 years and would rate him as a 'interested-non believer in UFO's.'

"From what ________ said I got the impression he felt it was a solid object - and ________.

"He said he saw (2 or 3 times) a "bright spark or streak" of light "jump out from the rear of the object" when it was overhead.

________ vision is very good and he is generally skeptical in his overall attitude towards extra-terrestrial craft/beings etc.

Cordially,

Sighting Account:

On 14 October 1969, 8:40 PM EDT, [redacted] Business Telephone

Shirley, Mass. (Home Telephone) [redacted] was driving home on Route #2 heading west when he
signaled a line of 7.9 of "Flint-like" sparking lights at an elevation of
4.5° in the WNW which appeared to be moving W - E over a section of nearly-
installed power lines. He stopped his car at the Route #2 Shirley Road,
exit (see map/arrow) and got out for a better look. (A few cars passed
by but did not seem to notice the strange lights). He shut off his car
engine to see if he could hear any sound from the apparent object but
nothing could be heard. The silent lights continued to move slowly east-
ward and as they came closer and passed directly over him changed from the
straight-line configuration to half circle with its leading edge moving
forward and one light to the rear. (See sketches). The noiseless, spark-
ing lights were like the spark from a cigarette lighter only
of greater magnitude. These flashed in a purely random sequence producing
the arc-like half circle with one frequent flash in the rear. This flash
also occasionally produced a straight line of light away from itself (see
sketch). It passed silently over him and continued eastward on Route #2
gradually getting smaller. He broke off watching and continued home.

Sighting duration was estimated at 5 minutes.

Although the sky was clear behind the object with a good background of
stars, he could not see the object itself very clearly. He had the impres-
sion that it was solid and flat. The apparent size of the object (if the
lights were indeed on its leading edges) was compared to his hand out-
stretched at arm's length or 6" by 6" at arm's length. At no time did he
observe the object passing in-front-of or behind any fixed objects other
than moving significantly with respect to background stars.

Sighting Evaluation:

My first thought was that perhaps a hoax cleaning garment hot-air balloon
might have been involved but the description and fact that it was moving
into the wind (15 knots) ruled this out. (This type of balloon with its
airborne candles always takes on an orange color, moves erratically, drops
burning material and usually its candles are snuffed out and/or the bag
burns while still under observation.) My second thought was that the wit-
ness arrived at a high-flying aircraft carrying several bright strobe lights.
These can appear to have a "sparking" effect and can be seen for miles.
However, usually only 2 or 3 are carried on the aircraft I have seen - 2
on the wing and one on the fuselage trying a "T" configuration. The facts
that no noise from it was heard nor conventional running lights seen seem
to rule out an aircraft. (Although strobe lights might appear to be
stationary.) It's apparent size was quite large (even if exaggerated unin-
tentionally), and it passed directly over the observer so one would think
that engine noise and running lights would have been easily noticed if an
aircraft were involved.

NICAP MASS SUBCOM Report
#69-27/14 October 1969 (Cont'd)

In the event others may have reported this object to the police or to
nearby Fort Devens, I phoned the following places:

Shirley Police Dept. - No reports noted on blotter
(617/425-4377)                (Local airport closed after dark)

Harvard Police Dept. - No reports noted on blotter.
(617/456-3321)                Said that sometimes there are low-
                                flying crop-dusting aircraft over
                                local apple orchards but that they
                                fly only in the daylight hours.

Littleton Police Dept. - No reports noted on blotter.
(617/486-4144)

Fort Devens                   - I talked to various Base Operations
(617/796-3911)                  personnel who told me that they had
                                received no UFO reports and that no
                                aircraft from that field was air-
                                borne. They did state that sometimes
                                during daylight hours a helicopter
                                operating out of Albany, New York
                                will run a low-level check on power-
                                lines but never at night.

Although I am tempted toward a probable-aircraft classification, the over-
all data seems to rule this out. If the witness's impression is taken at
face value. I phoned and requestionned Mr. [redacted] very closely and his
reaction to the aircraft suggestion was strongly negative. He said he had
gone through the motions of trying to identify it with something conven-
tional and found what he was watching "hard to believe" yet there it was.
The lights, according to him, were "not like strobe lights" and flashed
or "sparked" in a peculiar random pattern around what appeared to be a
curved surface. It was too dark to see but the light arrangement suggested
a partially-lighted circular object. His "impression" was that it was
large and flying at about 3000-5000 feet.

My evaluation is that this sighting should be classified as a low-weight
unknown. Its presence was "most" possible construction is not-with-
standing perhaps only coincidental. The witness is considered highly
reliable and has a technical background in engineering as well as holding
a responsible supervisory position. (See Data Sheet3).

October 29, 1969

Dear Action Line:

Last night (Tuesday) I sighted a U.F.O. & know that sounds funny but it's true.

I'd take a lie detector test, I'd swear on three bibles, I would even let you print my letter, and risk my reputation.

Here the terrible secret, and I swear to the Lord in heaven, this story.

It was 4:00 a.m. early Tuesday morning, & couldn't sleep, so I decided to go outside and get some air of.

It was clear, the stars were brighter then I ever saw in the city.

And with just returning from Minnesota, I was quite amazed how bright the stars were & I think noticed something strange in what I thought a star or a planet in the East.

It started to move, first it was bright yellow, then turned to a bright inky bright reddish

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES SEPTEMBER 29-OCTOBER 5, 1969

The charts in this publication are a
continuation of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau publication,
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500-millibar
Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation
Chart. All of the charts for one day are
arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the
National Meteorological Center Weather
Bureau. The symbols used on the
Surface Weather Map and the 500Millibar Chart are the same as those
used previously in Daily Weather Map.
An explanatory series is available, and
single copies may be obtained without
charge by writing to: Environmental
Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville,
Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may be
ordered from the Superintendent of
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, at a cost
of $3.75 per 50 copies. Checks should

be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m./c.s.t. The tracks of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows; the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding map time are indicated by
small black squares. Precipitation areas, as indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and
which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from these station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

The 500-millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherms on the
500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./c.s.t.
The height contours are shown as
thickest lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are
shown as dashed lines, and are labeled
in degrees Celsius. The arrows show
the wind direction and speed at the
500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum
and minimum values for the 24-hour
period ending at 7:00 a.m./c.s.t. The
names of the reporting points can be
obtained from the Surface Weather
Map. The maximum temperature is
plotted above the station location, and
the minimum temperature is plotted
below the point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation during
the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m.
Amounts in inches to the nearest
hundredth of an inch are for the same
period. Incomplete totals are indicated. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth
of snow on the ground in inches as of
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

SUBJECT: UFO Investigation

TO: XFCC

1. Mr. [redacted] was contacted by telephone at 1900 on 17 NOV 69. The attached AF Form 117 (Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire) was completed and supplements the original letter and drawing sent by Roder (Atch 1). Mr. [redacted] seemed genuinely convinced that the object he saw was a UFO. The facts, while not positively identifying the object, suggest that his story is at best, dubious.

2. Assuming Roder's elevation angle of 50 Degrees is correct, and using a conservative estimate of 1000 Feet equal to 4 residential blocks (1360' is more accurate), then, the object would have been approximately 1200' in the air. If we accept the statement that it would take a basketball to cover the object along the line of sight, then by trigonometry the object would have to be 650 Feet in diameter. It is virtually impossible for an object fitting the above description to even partially disappear behind a "tree or house across the street."

3. My greatest criticism lies in the fact that apparently no one else saw the object. Mr. [redacted] residence is approximately 6 miles ESE of O'Hare Airport, and 6 miles S of Glenview NAS. I contacted both Mr. Nealy of Chicago ARTC and Chief Stewart of Glenview Public Affairs (Navy counterpart of 1350). Neither of these men had any record of a UFO being reported on 25 or 29 October. It seems logical to me that if this large object had passed over [redacted] roof, heading West at 60mph, somebody at O'Hare should have seen it.

4. The obvious discrepancies concerning velocity of the object and time observed (stated 65 minutes in letter and 90 minutes on the telephone) warrant no further comment.

5. In conclusion, while [redacted] thought he was seeing a UFO, it is the opinion of this investigator that he was the victim of his own vivid imagination and the distinct possibility of a charter shuttle helicopter passing overhead.

The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are as in the previously published Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available and may be copied by writing to Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Science Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, at a cost of $3.25 per 25 copies.

Remit in mode payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. The traces of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather centers at times of 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosed in white circles. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather report data are printed here as a feature of these last few included in the special daily weather maps which the analyst are based. Occasionally station data cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 700 mb (est. The height contours are shown as on previous maps and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines and are located in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m., each. The values are obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the storm center, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Chart and amounts that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete data is indicated. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines are drawn to scale at stop on the ground in inches, and 7.00 in. of precipitation.
