MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL OF 21 Jul 65

A M[illegible] 45430 called to say that he has been sighting an unusual object in the sky for the past several nights. Since the 12th of July to be exact. Saw it at about 20° - 25°, at 745 pm in the SW 265°. The description and elevations that he gave over the phone were plotted by Sgt Moody on the Globe. Objects were Venus and Regulus, however M[illegible] was quite insistent that this could not be the case, he then started getting his directions mixed up, so Sgt Moody suggested that he fill out an FTD Form 164. This form was sent to him on the afternoon of 21 Jul 65.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
