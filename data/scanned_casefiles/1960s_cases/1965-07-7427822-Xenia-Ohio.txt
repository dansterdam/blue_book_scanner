MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL OF 21 JUL 65

A M[redacted], 4:54:30 called to say that he has been sighting an unusual object in the sky for the past several nights. Since the 12th of July to be exact, he saw it at about 20° - 25°, at 7:45 pm in the SW 265°. The description and elevation that he gave over the phone were plotted by Sgt Moody on the globe. Objects were Venus and Regulus, however M[redacted] was quite insistant that this could not be the case, he then started getting his directions mixed up, so Sgt Moody suggested that he fill out an FTD Form 154. This form was sent to him on the afternoon of 21 Jul 65.

ON 26 JULY 1965 I SIGHTED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT "LIGHT" TO THE WEST AT ABOUT 10:00 PM. OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS THEN MOVED RAPIDLY TO THE EAST NORTHEAST FOR ABOUT 1/2 MINUTE, THEN DISAPPEARED. IT WAS OF SUCH INTENSITY THAT IT VIRTUALLY CAUSED A BLINDING EFFECT. IT SEEMED TO BE THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON. IT PRODUCED NO SOUND AND NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST. IT WAS A STEADY, BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. IT APPEARED TO BE AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. ESTIMATED SPEED WAS AROUND 1000 KNOTS. IT APPEARED MOTIONLESS ON FIRST SIGHTING THEN MOVED ERRATICALLY AND RAPIDLY EASTWARD, THEN DISAPPEARED RATHER ABRUPTLY. I BELIEVE IT WAS SOME SORT OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRBORNE OBJECT OF UNKNOWN CHARACTERISTICS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some instructions. The diagram shows a curved skyline and a compass rose, with instructions for the observer to imagine the point where the object was sighted and draw its position relative to the horizon and compass. The instructions also ask the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object and any changes in direction during the course.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
