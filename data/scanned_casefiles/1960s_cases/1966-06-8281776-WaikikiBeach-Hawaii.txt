1. Attached is a U.F.O. report of very doubtful validity. It is apparently transmitted to your office for your records and is also to be reported to N.I.C.A.P.
2. Some comments which may not care to put on the record itself: This appeared to be a pathetic attempt to gain some publicity by an artist whose career would appear to be understated. The lady appeared to be disturbed and lived alone in a poor one room apartment with very visible and shabby furnishings. We assisted her in having an apparent fear being evicted.
3. She is an apparent fan and follower of N.I.C.A.P. and is being watched by us from outa surveillance standpoint.
c. My NCO, TSgt Saldonio Montiboni, and I feel this was a rather desperate attempt to gain in the U.P.O. of publicity and nothing more.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a detailed description of a UFO sighting. The text describes an oval-shaped object 50 to 60 feet long, emitting a white light with five bright lights blinking in between. The object had a vapor trail with sparks and five flames that emerged one at a time, with the largest one disappearing last. The object was observed at a 105 angle south of the observer, and flew horizontally towards the sea for about 3/4 mile before disappearing instantaneously.

The report states that there had been considerable interest and public concern with a meteor/satellite burn out case. It also mentions an incident on 29 June 1966 in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, but indicates that the report was not considered to be of sufficient significance to be included in the Project Blue Book files and was therefore ignored.
