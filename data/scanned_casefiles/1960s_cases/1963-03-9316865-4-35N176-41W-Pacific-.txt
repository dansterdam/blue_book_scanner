7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
5 minutes

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
East

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
CIRVIS report of small object with
no visible sign of propulsion in
flight from West to East. Appeared
at 10 dgr elevation in West & sighting
duration 5 minutes. Disappeared by
fading. Object very high & speed very
fast. Sighting from C-121.

11. COMMENTS
Direction wrong for satellite.
Should be NE or SE since sighting
near the equator. Duration consistent with satellite or a/c
since sighting was fm air, if
object were a/c it would be at
extreme altitude to prevent some
feature from being identified.
Insufficient data for evaluation.
Possible error in direction, in
which case object was likely
satellite. (No)

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possible Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other
[X] Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

The rest of the document appears to be a table with multiple columns of numerical data, with dates across the top (March 14, 1963, March 15, 1963, etc.) and rows of numerical values. The text is very dense and appears to be orbital tracking data for a satellite.
