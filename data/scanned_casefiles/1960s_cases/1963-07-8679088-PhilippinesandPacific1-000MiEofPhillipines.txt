Subject: "Flaming Object" Seen in Mindanao 
Reference: AF 13 2466 of 3 Aug 59. I called Captain Koran; I confirmed that Vandenberg Air Force Base reported from Vandenberg to the Pacific Missile Range, and this report is for information.
Captain Koran was called back to say that SAC and 15th Air Force advised that no aircraft under their control was in the area at the time. Also Hickam and the 13th Strategic Aerospace Division at Vandenberg advised they had no aircraft in the area.
