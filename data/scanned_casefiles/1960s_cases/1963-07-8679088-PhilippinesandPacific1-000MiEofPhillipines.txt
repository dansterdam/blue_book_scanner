Subject: "Flaming Objects" Seen in Mindanao

Reference AE IN 2466 of 29 Aug 63, I called Captain Moore in the SAI Information Office and asked him to evaluate an answer from Vandenberg, requesting that Vandenberg coordinate its with the Pacific Missile Range, and that SAC then phone it to us for clearance with DOD and dispatch.

Captain Moore called back later to say that SAC had sent the attached message to us, marked for Official Use Only with a copy priority to the US Air Attaché in Manila and other copies to USAF Field Activities Group at Fort Belvoir and the Los Strategic Aerospace Division at Vandenberg.

I asked him whether the information in the message could be used by Manila to answer press inquiries, and after conferring with SAC Policy Officers, he said that it could. I then suggested that the SAC following message stating and that this following message suggest the Air Attaché coordinate with the Attachment before releasing message.

I notified Mrs. Lil Lee on the DOD Press Desk of the various actions taken.

Max Boyd
