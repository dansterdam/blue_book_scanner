This is to report a call I made to Mr. ------ of Pennsylvania, relative to his sightings of August 12th and August 23rd of his wife of August 12th and August 23rd.

Mr. ------ runs his own business called ------ Irc. which is not only a business of maintenance and programming data of building industries, but also computer services to corporations, title agencies, etc. Until he began his own company he was a nuclear physicist in Pittsburgh, working on nuclear rocket propulsion.

I had long talks with him. He is not only scientifically oriented, but he is also a member of the Pittsburgh Astronomical Group. He apparently gets into some hot arguments with the leaders of this group, however, as he seems to contradict their stand on certain things concerning astronomy and linking up with a number of other than up with activities.

His sightings, as far as motion was concerned, was good except for three cases the motion was from east to west. There seems to be no doubt this event did take place as he said they did, and when coming to his particular sightings, in all three cases a bright light, apparently very much brighter than Venus, when and then fading out as they approached the horizon. Until satellites, as far as ascertain was concerned, was good except for three cases the motion was from east to west. There seems to be no doubt this event did take place as he said they did, and when coming to his particular sightings, in all three cases a bright light, apparently very much brighter than Venus, when and then fading out as they approached the horizon.

The sighting of August 13th, 1957 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time/August 12th 4:17 U.T.: The object was best reported, and it will be described by other sightings of this type. 

Mr. *** had been out most of the night watching for the appearance of the object he sighted the night before. On the hydrographic chart it was a meteorographic condition to be kept at a watch all that morning. He had left his house and had gone in for just a few minutes before 4:17 A.M. and kicked himself for doing this since. When he got outside, there object sighting, disappeared, apparently moving away from the area to the south and proceeded at a rate of about 2° per second. It was about 30° or 40° from the western horizon, where it faded out. The entire journey in 25 plus or minus 5 seconds (when it was estimated at 35 seconds). It seemed to move definitely faster than Echo, but by no means as fast as the rustle out a slow meteor on several counts. He also rustle cut cause he says that the Nov zodiacal light occurrence flight caused him to be extremely familiar with planets from that standpoint, and from the experience in the Naval Air Force as a radar operator for some years.  

It is interesting to point out that if the objects are successful, a retrospective satellite, the period would have been 1 hour and this giving an average height of 327 miles and an angular speed that observed. There is the outside possibility that he observed a natural satellite which would have had a life of just a few days watched that night until dawn but the object did not reappear. It would have been considerably more this object in the earth's shadow at about 2:00 A.M.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Mr. - stated he is scientifically baffled, quite certain as an observer he is acquainted with high-flying jets and he says it was not a known type aircraft. Concerning the other sightings, the first sighting was Thursday, August 27th. The sighting was apparently very similar to the sighting of August 13th except that there was no moon. The time was 11:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Saving Time. The sighting of August 15th was not, as well as the sky. It was observed at about only 20° elevation above the western horizon, having come into sight directly in the south and proceeding in a northwesterly direction. With the sound low, this horizon shrouds well have been an aircraft away to be heard. It is harder to apply this interpretation to objects which were seen directly overhead. If we adopt as the apparent angle of value reference to our tables shows that a craft at 10,000 feet would be 250 miles per hour, or at 5 miles, 625 miles per hour. Because the distance of the sight 1 would favor something close to Piper Cub, for instance, 3 to 5,000 feet above him. Of course, he may deny this, but it seems the most logical. A jet would have to be hand, and the brilliance of the light argues against an aircraft. There is the possibility of a captured retrograde natural satellite, there is the unidentified category. Because it appeared as several and did in such case a systematic motion, and this motion is not that of an aircraft, I would tend to disregard the lack of sound this down as possible aircraft. Don't tell this to Mr. - with whom I recently spoke again's haste.

This is to report a call I made to Mr. [redacted] on Sunday, August 15, 1965.

[redacted]was doing his own business called [redacted], which is not only a business of interest-earning and giving, but is also connected with computer services to institutions, etc. Until he began his own company he was a nuclear physicist at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, working on nuclear rocket propulsion.

I have a long talk with him. He is not only scientifically oriented, but he is also a member of the Pittsburgh group. He apparently gets into some hot arguments with the local group, however, to take his story. At any rate, his interest and devotion to this subject is claimed to be a member of these up-with. He believes in a case, reported to USAF, of one of the Pittsburgh scientists having been hassled by a bright ball of light that rose directly overhead and then faded from sight.

On all three cases the objects were bright, apparently very much brighter than Echo, when they first appeared. And on fading out, they faded very rapidly, much faster than satellites, so far as motion was concerned, was good except for the final fade out, where the motion was from east to west. There seems to be about this, since he little altitude and attitude."

There is no photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The text appears to be a detailed description and analysis of a UFO sighting that occurred on August 13th, 1965 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

The sighting of August 13th, 12:17 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time is the best reported, and I will give a description, the other two sightings different from that.

It had been seen on several counts. He rules out a slow meteor on several counts. He is also rules out because he saw the object on the New York-Pittsburgh flight pattern, and was seen by plane spotters.

It is interesting to note that if the objects on success seemed a startling, the reported would have been 1 bright enough to illuminate sufficiently that a life of that 6 a few day passage would have been possible, and that the time giving an average height of 57 miles and an angular speed that observed. There is the outside possibility that it was internal visible which would have had a life of just a few seconds.

The passage would have been considerably to the west, the object must not have reappeared. At about 2:00 A.M.

The text reads:

Mr. ??? is obviously intelligent, scientifically quite competent as an observer. Since he is emphatic on the fact that he is well acquainted with high-flying jets and that he is satisfied that "they" are not some form or a problem then if we could assess this as an aircraft.

Thursday, August 13th, the public was apparently very excited. The time was 11:30 P.M., Daylight Saving Time. The sighting of August 11th was not seen on the 13th. The object was seen directly above western horizon, having come into sight directly in the south and proceeding in a northwesterly direction. With the naked eye, this could very well have been a star, distant and with a glowing light. It is harder to apply this interpretation to the two sightings which were seen directly overhead. If we adopt 20 or more seconds as a necessary timeframe, and compare this to our knowledge of the speed of sound, this would place the craft at 10,000 feet or some 250 miles per hour, or at 5 miles, 625 miles per hour. Because very great brightness of the light, it would favor a faster, distant object 5,000 feet above him, of course, this is highly improbable, but it seems the most logical. A jet would have not to be heard, and the brilliance of the light against the dark sky would make this the strongest possibility. There is the unidentified category. Because it appeared on two occasions and was in each case a one-witnesse matter, and the motion is that of an aircraft, I would tend to classified this down as possible aircraft. Don't tell this to Mr. ???, he will surely argue against this.

January 12,

To: Major Hector Quintanilla USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
AFCIN-XETB, Air Force Base
Washington 25, D.C.

This is to report a call I made to Mr. G
Pennsylvania, relative to his sightings of August 11th and August 17th, 1965, and the sightings of his wife, of August 5th, 1965.

Mr. G now runs his own business called General Company, Inc. which is not only a business but maintenance and programing of devising means of furnishing real time computer services to business organizations, etc. Until he began his own company he was a nuclear physicist with Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, who has since devised a nuclear rocket propulsion system which is now under consideration by the group.

I had a long talk with him. He is not only scientifically oriented, but he is also a member of the Pittsburgh Academy of Science. He apparently sees into these intriguing events with the lucidity of a trained observer.

The group, however, to hear his story. At any rate, his interest stems largely from the idea of linking a number of these up with his so-called "cases", reported to NICAP, of one of the Pittsburgh firms who is interested in his work. The been highly distorted and then landed in a nearby field. NICAP has this report, and coming to his particular sightings: In all three cases a bright light, apparently very much brighter than she, when and then fading out as they approached the horizon. Their speed, as far as motion satellites, as to veer suddenly was concerned, was good except for a bright light, supposedly very much brighter than any known stars, about which he lists altitude and azimuth.

The text in the document is as follows:

The sighting of August 13th, 12:17 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time was observed by a Mrs. U.S. in the East Greenburg, and it will follow mentionary two other two sightings differ from that.

Mr. --- had been out most of the night watching for the appearance of the object be sighted the might before. On the first time it was a retrograde satellite he kept a vigil all that evening on house and had gone in for just a few minutes before 12:17 A.M. and missed sighting another similar one which passed.

When he got outside, under object directly overhead, apparently hovering some from the east, exactly in the zenith and proceeded at a rate of about 2° per second was about 20 or 30 feet across the western horizon, where it faded out. The entire journey in 25 plus or minus 5 seconds (when we're retired memory over the telephone, it came cut 35 seconds). He stated the seemed to move definitely faster than a-jet, but by no means as fast as a meteor. He rules out a planes on several points. He also states the cause as they are in the New York-Pittsburgh flight pattern and extremely familiar with planes from that standpoint, and from travel in the Naval Air Force on a regular commuter for four years.

It is interesting to note that if the objects on successive occasions been a retrograde satellite, the period would have been 4 hour and sure giving an extremely short period which is singular and so much that observes.
There is the outside possibility that he observed natural satellite which would have had a life of just a few days inasmuch that night until dawn, but the object did not reappear. So the passage would have been considerably to the west, the object might have lost in the earth's shadow at about 3:00 A.M.

Text of the document:

Mr. -- is obviously intelligent, scientifically quite competent as an observer. Since he is emphatic on the fact that he is well acquainted with high-flying jets and that they "seem" are faced with more of a problem than if he could see an aircraft. 

Concerning the other sightings: The first sighting was on Thursday, August 15th. The passage was apparently very similar to the one of August 13th except that there was no moon. The time was 11:30 P.M., night giving time. The sighting of August 11th was not so in the day. It was observed as about 250' elevation above the western horizon, having come into sight directly in the south proceeding in a northwesterly direction. With the sighting of the low elevation, this could very well have been an aircraft away to be heard. It is harder to apply this interpretation which were seen directly overhead.

If we adopt the "per apparent angle of reference" our tables shows that a craft at 10,000 feet would have an apparent angular elevation of about 250 miles per hour, or at 5 miles, 625 miles per hour. Because of the rapidity of flight, this would appear something like a jet with its sudden acceleration. I would never contend that the sightings were per se a proof of the existence of interplanetary vehicles, but it seems the most logical explanation. A jet would have not have to be heard, and the brilliance of the light argues against where is the possibility of a sustained retrograde maneuver, there is the unidentified category. Because it appeared on two occasions as a one-witness matter, and the motion is that of an aircraft, a would tend to classify the last of at least this down as possible aircraft. Don't tell this to Mr. -- as he would stoutly argue against this.
