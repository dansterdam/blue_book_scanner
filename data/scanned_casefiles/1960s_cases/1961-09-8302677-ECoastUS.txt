The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "A" marked on the curve. There are also several rays or lines extending from the bottom of the sketch, suggesting an object above the horizon.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. The left scene depicts a rural landscape with buildings and trees, and a person standing in the foreground. The right scene shows a more distant landscape with mountains in the background and a small person silhouetted in the foreground.

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

From: A. E. CLARKE, JR., QM1, USS RANDOLPH (CVS-15)
Navigation Department Leading Petty Officer
To: The Hydrographer, U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office

SUBJECT: Observation of Unidentified Aerological Phenomena

1. At time 0430 39m (0939 GMT) 13 September 1961, in the vicinity of latitude 39o24'N, longitude 71o20'W, (operation by JORNADA), a small elongated orange colored light, extending east to west was observed. This light was flashing, intermittently, approximately 1 to 2 times per second. This light appeared, closely resembling a miniature moon. This light became brighter and then dimmed, until it reached a maximum brightness, and then it began to dim again. This took approximately 5 seconds. At this time the crescent moon was observed, which was approximately 1/3 full. This took approximately 5 seconds at which time it quickly faded and disappeared. A slight increase of barometric pressure was observed.

2. Cloud coverage: 2/10 cumulus with slight traces of alto cumulus. Atmospheric pressure: 29.10 inches (sea level) Aneroid. Wind force 3 its from 280o True.

3. This phenomena was observed in its entirety by myself and the Junior Officer of the Deck, LT US A. M. ARDOIN, USNR.

Very respectfully,

31 October 1961

Dear ***

Your letter of 21 September 1961 regarding the sighting of a unknown object by the crew of an Eastern Airlines flight on 13 September 1961 has been received and considered.

Your account of this sighting report seems to be a bona fide experience. The object launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, which released a trail as it moved up and down the Atlantic Ocean, up and down the Atlantic seaboard of the mid-eastern U.S.

A copy of your report has been forwarded to the Office of Aerospace Technical Intelligence, USAF, and the Division of Intelligence, USAF. Your interest in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

REC'D NASA NO.P10
SEP 19 10 62 '61
National Space Agency
Washington (25) D.C.
This date at approximately 4:25 A.M. the undersigned husband and wife observed the following unusual incident in space:
Location: Approximately 50-25 degrees above earth. Position/ North, North East, and North West direction. The object was traveling at a high speed and appeared dark and elliptical in shape. Both witness agree the object appeared as to the following description:
Diameter: about 20 feet or greater, circumference being about that of basketball, and seemed to be stationary for some (12) seconds, then there was a glow and it suddenly disappeared at the same speed as it had appeared. No noise was heard.
The sighting was made on a clear night, the time was approximately 4:25 A.M. and the the sky was dark. Weather conditions at the time were clear. It is felt that hundreds of feet and the object is unknown and what it may have been remains a mystery. It is believed it may have been a natural body in space, but we were unable to identify what it was. We hope this is helpful data or information.

0930 GMT, 13 September 1961
STARS: A small elongated orange colored light extending east to west was observed bearing 120 degrees true at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees. Approximately 45 seconds later, bearing 050 degrees true elevation 70 degrees a round silverish light appeared, closely resembling a miniature moon. This light became larger and brighter, resembling a hazy moon. Until it reached what appeared to be a diameter of about 6-8 times that of full moon. This took approximately 55-57 seconds. At this time it blossomed out in a burst of bright orange light still retaining its globular shape, expanding to a proportion approximately 75-95 times that of full moon. This took approximately 7 seconds, at which time it quickly faded and disappeared. Slight traces of orange were observed 1 minute later, then completely disappeared. It was concluded that the object of this sighting was a NASA experimental rocket launch from Wallops Island, Va., which released sodium material considerably higher than 100 miles above the earth. The chemical released was visible for some distance in the Atlantic Ocean and up and down the Atlantic seaboard and as far inland as areas of the mid-western U. S.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bailey,

Your letter of 13 September 1961 addressed to the National Space Agency has been referred to the Air Force.

This matter on a continuing report of a shiny object observed in the sky by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was among their sightings of unknown objects, but was not concluded as being of concern in the national defense. The object appeared to be visible up and down the Atlantic seaboard, and for considerable distance inland (the east coast, generally).

A further interesting note: your description almost matched a similar report from a vessel cruising between Bermuda and the U.S.

I am unable to provide an answer as to what could have caused the odor, but can assure you it is not from another source attributable to the sighting.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
