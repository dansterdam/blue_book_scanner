From: A. E. CLARKE, JR., QM1, USS RANDOLPH (CVS-15)
Navigation Department Leading Petty Officer
To: The Hydrographer, U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office

Subj: Observance of Meteorological Phenomena

1. At time 04h 39m (0939 GMT) 13 September 1961, in the vicinity of
latitude 36°25.5"N, longitude 71°30"W, (position by LORAN), a small
elongated orange colored light extending East to West was observed
bearing 320° at an altitude of approximately 45°. Approximately 45
seconds later, bearing 040°T, altitude 70°, a round silveries light
appeared, closely resembling a miniature moon. This light became
larger and brighter resembling a hazy moon, until it reached what appeared to be a diameter of about six to eight times that of a full
moon. This took approximately 5 - 7 seconds. At this time it blossomed
out in a burst of bright orange light still retaining its globular
shape, expanding to a proportion approximately 75 to 95 times that of
full moon. This took approximately 7 seconds, at which time it quickly
faded and disappeared. Slight traces of orange were observed one
minute later, then completely disappeared.

2. Cloud coverage: 2/10 cumulus with slight traces of alto cumulus.
Temperature: Dry bulb 79°F, Wet bulb 71°F; Relative humidity 67%.
Barometric pressure: 30.10 inches (sea level) Aneroid. Wind force
3 kts from 340°T. Horizon hazy. Sky clear and stars very prominent.

3. This phenomena was observed in its entirety by myself and the
Junior Officer of the Deck, LCDR T. M. ATKINS, USNR.

Dear [redacted]

Your letter of mid-September to the Hydrographer, U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office, has been referred to this Office by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Your excellent sighting report of an unknown object 13 September 1961, was concluded to be a NASA experimental rocket launching from Wallops Island, Virginia, which released sodium material considerably higher than a 100 miles above the earth. The chemical release was visible for some distance in the Atlantic Ocean, up and down the Atlantic Seaboard and an area known as the Mid-western U.S.

A copy of your report has been forwarded to the Office of Aerial Phenomena, Foreign Technology Division, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Your interest in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

RECD NASA HQ PIO
SEP 10 10 42 PM '61

13 September, 1961

National Space Agency
Washington (25), D.C.

Copy Retained/ File PBX 5

This date at approximately 1/35 A.M. the undersigned husband and wife observed the following un-known object in space.
Location/ Approximately 30-35 degrees above earth. Position/ North, North East, and South West of the star commonly referred to as the morning star.
Witness Location/ Their residence, above address.

Both witness agree the object appeared as to the following description:

Suddenly a dark red or orange colored sphere appeared, the circumference being about that of a basketball, and seemed to be stationary for some (10) seconds, then there appeared to be an explosion and the Fire-ball increased its circumference to that of a good sized farm wagon wheel, then the perfectly round sphere was greatly obscured by a "foggy" smokey cloud.

With this phase of action the fire mass seemed to rise into the upper stratosphere and disappeared into the upper heavens leaving a red-tine orange or illuminant light that spread hundreds of feet, beyond the core of the fiery mass.

And motor traffic noise seemed to have gone under ground in expectation of this happening several minutes before and after the sighting, and with this favorable quite region of un-natural city noise was more able to realize there was no explosion, shine or motor exhaust noise coming from this object that suddenly appeared and vanished with un-believable speed.

Shortly after the sphere vanished there was a strong odor in the air as that which is common to smouldering coke or char-coal, the same quickly cleared from the air.

This report is submitted in all good faith as a National duty, further elaborations is not within our power. Respectfully submitted.

No mention to any neighbors or any persons has been voiced in regards to this sighting.
The weather bureau was contacted by telephone (U.S. Weather Bureau, Federal Bldg. located in Cincinnati, Ohio) The person speaking did not identify himself, the call was made at approximately 4/30 P.M. 13 September, 1961, near twelve hours after the sighting.
The W.B. person stated they knew of no such sightings and had received no other inquiries as to such. The W.B. suggested the acts of high school, amateur scientist etc.

Twisting this may be helpful data or information, we are

Respectfully & Sincerely,

0930 GMT, 13 September 1961

Sited a small elongated orange colored light extending east to west was observed bearing 320 degrees true at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees. Approximately 45 seconds later, bearing 040 degrees true elevation 70 degrees a round silverish light appeared, closely resembling a miniature moon. This light became larger and brighter, resembling a hazy moon. Until it reached what appeared to be a diameter of about 6-8 times that of full moon. This took approximately 5-7 seconds. At this time it blossomed out in a burst of bright orange light still retaining its globular shape, expanding to a proportion approximately 75-95 times that of full moon. This took approximately 7 seconds, at which time it quickly faded and disappeared. Slight traces of orange were observed 1 minute later, then completely disappeared.

It was concluded that the object of this sighting was a NASA experimental rocket launching from Wallops Island, Va., which released sodium material considerably higher than 100 miles above the earth. The chemical released was visible for some distance in the Atlantic Ocean and up and down the Atlantic seaboard and as far inland as areas of the mid-western U.S.

23 October 1961

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bailey:

Your letter of 13 September 1961 addressed to the National Space Agency has been referred to the Air Force.

The sighting you witnessed was a launching of a sodium experiment carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from their Wallops Island, Va. The rocket carried a payload of sodium material to a height above a hundred miles and released it, providing a rather spectacular site visible up and down the Atlantic Seaboard, in the Atlantic Ocean and for considerable distance inland (the Mid-west, Central).

A rather interesting note: your description almost matched that of a report from a vessel cruising between Bermuda and the U.S. mainland.

It is not possible to answer what could have caused the color. I can only guess that it was from another source and was coincidental to the sighting.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
