31. Date you completed this questionnaire:   27   June   1964

32. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Explanation of page 5 sketches
A1 to B1 is the path taken by the first object sighted - a white-silver
A3 to B3 is the path taken by the next object sighted - a red
A2 to B2 is the path taken by the next two objects sighted - both white-silver

This has been the explanation of the compass. Following is an explanation at the printing figure.

A1 - B1 is the altitude of all of the white objects
A2 to B2 is the altitude of the red

These could not have been satellites because of how large they were and because there were two satellites visible. The last night (probably both the same one) they were the first and last things we saw that night. There were many airplanes in the area also and they were much noise and were colored much differently. By comparison I have been able to tell that the object was neither.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Our Project Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has attempted to evaluate the two UFO sightings you recently reported.

The sighting of March 1, 1964 has tentatively been analyzed as a misinterpretation of a conventional object. The duration of one hour 41 minutes contains several sightings of multiple objects. No time motion sequence can be interpreted from the data presented. Some characteristics of balloons, aircraft and astronomical bodies are present.

With respect to the sightings of June 5, 1964, it is possible that three or the four objects observed were meteors; however, the fourth object was not described in sufficient detail to enable analysis.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEN

SUBJECT: Request For UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs. Gaiser)

1. We have received two complete PFD Forms 164 from Mr. [redacted] of Middleboro, Massachusetts. He has requested an Air Force evaluation on these two sightings.

2. The sighting of 1 March 1964 is evaluated as misinterpretation of conventional objects. The duration of one hour will include several sightings of multiple objects. No time motion sequence can be interpreted from the data presented. Some characteristics of balloons, aircraft, and astronomical bodies are present. The motion and relation to various objects is confusing. The duration of each object was omitted. Should Mr. [redacted] air a more complete evaluation, it is suggested the report each object separately.

3. Regarding the sighting of 5 June 1964, these observations were of four distinct objects with duration of 1, 5, and 40 seconds. It is likely that 3 or 4 objects observed were meteors. While the fourth object was not considered in sufficient detail for analysis, this object is carried as insufficient data.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

see page 8

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experiences, which might be pertinent.
I am an amateur astronomer and have a working knowledge of sky mechanics and this sort of things. I do believe there are things in our atmosphere of extraterrestrial origin but I am conservative as far as reports (that is, I am not easily convinced that I am seeing a UFO). I like to see them but I don't like to fool myself.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
