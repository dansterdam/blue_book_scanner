CONTENTS: The observer called the duty officer to report a UFO sighting on April 16, 1968. This report # 117 was sent to the observer. Since the witness was last seen and the exact date was not given, the sighting was given only as April 16. The time of the sighting was also different by a month, as we also received a completed form 117 from the listing observer on 16 May 68. The details of the observation are that the course, time, and speed are conflicting, but the sighting is considered case conflicting.

The image contains two sketches. The larger one is a compass rose, with the cardinal directions and intermediate directions labeled. The smaller sketches depict a person standing on a road or path, with the landscape visible in the background.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE LOOKING UPON THE COMPASS ROSE PLACED AT "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from a Project Blue Book UFO report. The text on the page is a list of various UFO phenomena descriptions, such as "Move in a straight line", "Suddenly speed up and run away", "Break up in parts and reappear", and others. Below the list, there are two sections labeled "A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?" and "B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?", where the witness has written responses to these questions.

Project Blue Book was the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

Here is the output of the text found in the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON:
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?

Unfortunately, there is no photograph or image present in this document. It appears to be a page from a UFO report form or questionnaire, containing written text with various questions and response options.

As per your request, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Scattered white blobs of light appeared to darting around in the sky, changing direction and speed. They would appear and disappear at times. It seemed to float or drift rather than move in a steady straight line flight. The lights did not seem to be attached to any solid object that could be seen. The lights reminded me of a light scattered and reflection on water, like when sunlight glimmers on water's surface.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: UFO Observation, 5 Mar 63
TIME: 1235, EST
Duration, 15 - 20 minutes
Location: Dayton, Ohio Corner of Stanely Ave and Kuntz
Direction of Travel: Heading North
Elevation: 55 deg  
Mr. [redacted] and his friend observed the object on 5 March 1963 while in the car, saw it when they were turning the corner, seemed to be giving a glare, and at first seemed to be standing still over Globe Industries, moved very fast then and out of sighting within two or three seconds. Sees Jets all the time but this wasn't that. Seemed to be bright shiny metal, looked metallic. The object seemed way off in the distance, but it looked bigger when it got farther away, then it turned dark in color. About 90 deg from the sun (failed to say whether to the right, left, overhead). Mr. [redacted] would like one form for himself and one for his friend. Address them to his office: [redacted], Jr., Dayton, Ohio 45404

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A TREE OR OTHER COMMON OBJECT? SUCH AS THIS WOULD INDICATE APPROX THE SIZE OF THE COVERED OBJECT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE ANGULAR SUBTENSE OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD, THEN THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

The image contains a sketch and diagram related to a UFO sighting. The sketch appears to show the position and movement of multiple objects in the sky. There is also a compass diagram that seems to provide information about the altitude and direction of the observed objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 2 at 6:00, 2 more at 6:22. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
