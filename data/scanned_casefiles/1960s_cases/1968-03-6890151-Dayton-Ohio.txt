CONFLICTING DATA

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
COMMENTS: The observer called the duty officer to report a UFO sighting for 16 May 68. Since there was insufficient data in this report a 117 was sent to the observer. (none was sent to the witness). The form was later returned and the exact date was not given, the sighting was given only as April 68. The time the sighting also differed by approx. 1 hour. We also received a completed form 117 from the listed observer for the 16 May 68 sighting. This form also listed the month of the observation as April 68. Since no date is given on either form, the month, time, and course are conflicting, the sighting is both insufficient and conflicting data.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers sighted the reflection of sunlight from an object. The observers could not describe the object except that it looked somewhat elliptical.

COMMENTS: There are always several planes over Dayton arriving or departing from Wright-Patterson AFB. None reported anything unusual. No one at W-P Towers saw anything unusual. No other reports were submitted to this office on a sighting at that time. It seems possible that the observers saw an a.m. or the planes arriving or departing from W-2 AFB.

Location: Dayton, Ohio Corner of Stanely Ave and Kuntz

Direction of Travel: Heading North

Elevation: 55 deg

Mr. [redacted] and his Friend observed the object on 5 March 1963 while in the car, saw it when they were turning the corner, seemed to be giving a glare, and at first seemed to be standing still over Globe Industries, moved very fast then and out of sighting within two or three seconds. Sees jets all the time but this wasn't that. Seemed to be bright shiny metal, looked metallicThe object seemed way off in the distance, but it looked bigger when it got farther away, then it turned dark in color. About 90 deg from the sun ( failed to say whether to the right, left, overhead or what). Mr [redacted] would like one form for himself and one for his friend.
