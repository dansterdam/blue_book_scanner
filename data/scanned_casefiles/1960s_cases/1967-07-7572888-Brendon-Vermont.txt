UFO Observation, 29 July 1967

1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch has received a report of an unidentified flying object which was observed near Springfield on 29 July 1967 between 9 and 10 pm, CDT. The witness described the object as a bright, white, flashing light that crossed the sky (west to east) in approximately one minute.

2. The description is similar to that of an aircraft observation. Any information you can provide on aircraft in the Springfield area that may have been responsible for this observation will be helpful in our investigation.

In response to your letter of August 22, concerning UFO observation, we can be of little assistance. The controller on duty during the time indicated has no recollection of aircraft being in the area, nor did he see any unusual lights. It is entirely possible, however, that there could have been aircraft in the vicinity, of which the tower controller was not aware.

If you have not already, I suggest you contact the Watch Supervisor of the Air Route Traffic Control Center at Olathe, Kansas, who may be of assistance.

Spring Field 1160                                                14-2 Jul

Proposed reply to letter from _______ July 11, 1967 (Sightings#1 147/67)

Dear Mr. ________:

Reference your recent letter of July 11 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects which you have been observing since December 1966.

At this late date, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation into your earlier observations.

If you would like us to investigate your latter sightings of July 4 and 7, 1967 we will need additional information. Upon completion of the inclosed FTD Form 164, our analysts will undertake a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observations. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Dear Sirs: I am not sure where to direct this letter, but I thought if you were not the proper agency at least you would know where to send it.

Last night at about 12:30 I was sitting with a friend in the Brandon cemetery, which along its 7. We were sitting on the highest hill of the cemetery until the huge drove us crazy. We both stood up; my friend was looking directly over my left shoulder, and I over his. At that time I looked into the sky and saw a very strange object. I told her to turn around, without telling her what there was to be seen. She saw the same thing.

I got about a 5-10 second look "because of the fact that she turned around sharply, and the object was at speed, it appeared to her as a slow moving streak. But I was able to follow it over almost over the whole horizon. It appeared to me a lights moving slowly across the sky at about a 150 angle to the earth. The distance between the lights never varied. The light emitted was a dull glow, pure white, which also never varied. The lights appeared to be either small and very close, or very large and far away.

The moon was totally obscured by a ridge at this time. The visibility was unlimited; all the stars could be seen. The temperature at this time was 50-65°F.

At first I thought it might have been a plane, but there were no noises of a running or stalling engine(s). Also there were no running lights, only the two huge glows. I listened for the sound of a crash, but there was none. It was definitely not a helicopter; no helicopter I know of has such a slide ratio with such a power. There was complete silence in the air as well as in the cemetery. It also could not have been a satellite; its position in the sky was inconceivable for that.

I have been trying to convince myself that it was a very large meteor, but there are two holes in this line of thought: 1) its luminosity was that of a dull glow rather than a bright light (there was no haze or "or in the air), and 2) there were two glowing things, and the distance between them did not vary. The were equal in luminous intensity. It would seem to me that two meteors would not behave in such a manner.

Later when I returned I notified the Brandon police to ask them if they had had any more sightings of this object, and to make a report. As of that time they had not had any sightings.

July 11, 1967

Project Blue Book
U.S.A.F.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs,

Since December, 1966, I have witnessed four objects which I feel warrant attention as possible U. F. O.'s.

My first sighting occurred on Friday, December 2, 1966, around 11:00 P.M. I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a bright red and blinking light curving slowly from west to northwest. It was at a fairly low altitude. I don't feel qualified to estimate its size but it was similar in appearance and slightly larger than the red light of a water tower about 1 to 2 miles from our house. However, the water tower light is not visible from our patio where I was watching.

I observed the thing for about five minutes. It moved erratically. After turning from west to northwest it climbed and then it disappeared behind the houses behind our's. It apparently landed in a field between our house and the water tower. I


- page 16 -

waited another five minutes but it did not reappear.

It was silent and did not resemble any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen (such aircraft passes over our house). It was an overcast night and no stars were visible. The object appeared intelligently controlled.

No one was home but myself at the time and when I told my mother she only laughed. A rash of U. F. O. sightings occurred in our area shortly afterward.

Sometime last spring and again on July 4, 1967 at around 10:30 P.M. I witnessed a similar on the same object, apparently landing in the same area as that of my first sighting.

My last sighting occurred last Friday, July 7, 1967 at around 10:30 P.M. It was exactly like the others except that it was either smaller or further away. It was following the opposite course of my first sighting.

My mother saw it also and we watched it for about five minutes. It was moving east. We both noted that it moved noetically.

At first it moved at a moderate speed but


- page 17 -

Here is the text from the document:

sped up suddenly and disappeared in
the distance. It was a clear night and stars
were visible. This was not a star, met-
eorite, etc.

All these sightings have much in common.

All four were similar on the same ob-
ject.

All four were silent and did not resem-
ble conventional aircraft on heavenly
bodies, but did seem to be intelligent-
ly controlled.

With the exception of that last sight-
ing, all followed approximately the
same course of approximately the same
speed and all landed in approximately
the same spot.

The last sighting was following the
opposite course of the others (east-
veering northeast) and appeared to be
either smaller or further away.

All were sighted between 10:15 P. M.
and 11:15 P. M.
