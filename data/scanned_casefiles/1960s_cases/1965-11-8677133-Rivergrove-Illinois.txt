Dear Mr. [redacted]

We are reviewing our unidentified flying object reports from November 1965. Your report to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago has been forwarded to us. The information contained in this report is somewhat conflicting in that it states that the object was stationary and yet moved from East to West and was following an aircraft. Also, it states that the object was observed for three days. Would you and your children please complete the attached Form 164s and return them to our office at your convenience.

Sincerely,
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Dear Sir -
I thank you for your interest shown in our flying object. My children and myself watched this flying object for three different days but we remember it only partly that my wife was glad that the object turned out to be a plane. We will and will help you with all different sorts of information for Blue Book city for these weeks and a week later at [illegible] and we were able to read the signs.

I am very thankful, proud, and grateful to know we had more like yourself and surely one connected with you that are helping our country safe in the air.

Thank you again, Sincerely, [redacted]
