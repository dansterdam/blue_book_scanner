11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted round, whitish lights that appeared to have a small red light at the bottom. Objects were in formation, one behind the other, during entire sighting. No roll, trend, or exhaust was observed. Objects moved from right to left in straight line and then turned slightly to the left just before disappearing. Due to apparent fog condition, investigating officer believes observers saw an aircraft with its lights shining through the fog.

airplane but rather a weather balloon. He did not notify any government
or state official as he believed the unidentified object to be a weather
balloon. Both observers are employed together, and during the course of
normal conversation, the UFO was discussed. Mr. [observer number 1]
stated during the interview that he had a friend who also saw the
unidentified object and asked the investigating officer if he would be interested
in talking to him. That is how the investigating officer came to interview
him.

h. Other unusual conditions or activities:
(1) Local newspapers carried a story on the reporting of an
unidentified Flying object by numerous people in the San Diego - Los Angeles
area on the 27 and 28 of August. The newspaper stated that the object was
a weather balloon released from Holloman AFB, New Mexico.

i. Not applicable.

j. Los Angeles Center stated that a large (150 ft dia.) experimental
balloon Project No. H-66-74 was launched from Holloman AFB, New Mexico on
26 August at 0718Z. Holloman lost control of the balloon and it drifted to
Needles, California, where the SAGE Unit at Phoenix tracked it to Palmdale.
It then, went into an orbit in the vicinity of Taft, California. The
balloon was tracked in the above area for the 27 and 28 August, when it was
lost in the area of a thunderstorm.

k. Cy L. Asta, 1st Lieutenant, USAF, FV310930l, OIC, Flight Training,
4392d Aerospace Support Group, SAC, Vandenberg AFB, California 93437.

Analysis by preparing officer: Due to the existence of a large experimental
balloon in the vicinity of the sighted UFO and the description given by the
two observers which closely resembled that of the balloon, it is the opinion
of the preparing officer that the object sighted was the large experimental
balloon that was launched from Holloman AFB, New Mexico on the 26 of August
at 0718Z.

(1) Observer number 1 was in right front seat of automobile in motion over rough dirt traveling access road at approximately 10 MPH when she observed objects ahead, above and slightly to the right. Immediately brought the objects to the attention of Observers number 2 and 3.

(2) Approximately forty (40) degrees elevation and ten (10) degrees to the right of automobile's line of motion.

(3) Approximately forty (40) degrees elevation and forty (40) degrees to the left of automobile's line of motion.

(4) Observer number 1 - objects moved from right to left in straight line and then turned slightly to the left just before disappearing out of line of vision. Immediately after slight left turn, the lead object changed shape from spherical to vertical elliptical and objects appeared to accelerate.

Observer number 2 - confirmed above observations and further stated that when lead object changed shape, the small red light associated with the lead object was no longer visible. Observers number 2 observed entire visible flight of object through binoculars.

(5) Observer number 1 and 2 - objects disappeared over ridge of canyon to the north, northeast.

(6) Observer number 1 - one minute, Observer number 2 - twenty seconds.

(1) Observer number 1 - Mrs [redacted], age 20, temporarily residing with Sister-in-Law at [redacted] Drive, San Luis Obispo, California; occupation Beautician; Catholic; married. Cares for patients at Atascadero State Hospital; high school education. Familiar with aircraft appearances and sounds from observation. She has never flown in aircraft or traveled extensively. Was non-committal on belief or disbelief concerning existence of Flying Saucers. The observer does not drink intoxicating beverages, use drugs, or is under the care of a physician. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that this person is completely reliable. She displayed no indications of being the hysterical or nervous type of individual, and did not see objects that she could not identify as being something within her depth of technical knowledge and experience.

(2) Observer number 2 - Mrs [redacted], age 24, Drive, San Luis Obispo, California; occupation Bookkeeper; Catholic; married; high school education. Familiar with aircraft appearances and sounds from observation. She has never flown extensively. Stated that the first thing that came to her mind was Flying Saucers. She further stated she had observed many photos of Flying Saucers in news media, and had read considerable literature on the subject. Also that she recently viewed (Los Angeles) when a Flying Saucer believer was interviewed. This person admits believing in Flying Saucers and that their source is Russia and not our space. The observer does not drink intoxicating beverages, use drugs, or is under the care of a physician. It is the questionable because of her obvious strong conviction concerning manned air platforms. From a forensic country, the conviction could conceivably confuse the mental picture and logic analysis of any observation that is not immediately recognizable within her depth of knowledge. The observer appeared to be the slightly nervous type and very talkative which leads the preparing officer to believe she could have directly influenced the other two observers into believing her thoughts as the time of the sighting. Particularly since she was the only observer who had access to binoculars. She had not reported her observation to civil or military authorities.

(3) Observer number 3 - Husband of Mrs [redacted], age 24, Sales Clerk; Catholic; high school education. Not available for comments on observation. However, Mrs [redacted] stated her husband was a skeptic concerning Flying Saucers and left there was a logical explanation of what they had observed.

h. Contact by the preparing officer with local airports, Sheriff's Office, Highway Patrol, City Police, and Fire Department concerning any unusual occurrence in the area during the sighting period resulted in negative reports. The Sheriff's Office did remember hearing a low flying aircraft shortly after dusk. This confirmed observer number 2's comment that they had witnessed a low flying aircraft as they reared San Luis Obispo shortly after the sighting.

i. Not applicable.

j. Airfields, airports, and FAA facilities reported negative traffic in the reported area during the time of the sighting. However, this is inconclusive because many civil aircraft in this area do not file flight plans and tend to follow the coast as a visual reference for navigation.

k. Robert L. Hess, Major, USAF, FV210163h, Chief, Helicopter Section, 4392d Aerospace Support Group, SAC, Vandenberg AFB, California.

Analysis by preparing officer: During this season of the year, it is customary for fog to form along the coastal regions with low thin layer of stratus clouds extending inland for approximately eight to ten miles. When an aircraft is observed from the ground flying near or in a thin stratus cloud layer or in an obscured fog condition, any visible aircraft light will tend to diffuse and take on the appearance of a bright area of light. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object(s) observed was an aircraft with wing lights on to-check-cloud condition or give position to aircraft or airport in the area, flying slightly above a thin stratus cloud layer, and was the same aircraft reportedly by the Sheriff's Office as having been heard circling the city at low altitude. Because of the angle from which the objects were observed, it is possible that the reported red lights could have been the left red navigation light and the anti-collision light. A temporary partial break away from the cloud condition could shape one of the objects. The lack of any reported sound could be attributed to the observers being in an enclosed automobile with the motor and heater running.
