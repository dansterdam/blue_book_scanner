Mystery Satellites, Strange Space Happenings

Several official press releases dealing with strange goings - on between Earth and the Moon in the past few months, leads us to summarize and advance some theories on the possible meaning of same.

In SCIENCE Magazine for 22 November 1963, Robert Werivras of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, Virginia, wrote about the odd behavior of Satellite Anna: It seems the satellite is equipped with five blinking lights and according to Richard B. Kershner, Applied Physics Lab, John Hopkins Univ. for several months, then they worked fine for three, and finally none at all, though the electrical system appeared as sound and the lights could no longer wink. Then, Kershner said, around the first of August, 1963, the lights started flashing again. Werivras said the short "must have burned itself out and this sort of thing is hard to believe."

Kershner, speaking at a conference of artificial satellites at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, said Anna was another example of a satellite which repaired itself while humans were helpless to do anything.

Kershner further cited an occasion when Mariner II, on its way to the vicinity of Venus, was "struck by a tiny meteorite," which apparently severed some of the wire from the power supply. The records showed a jolt to the satellite as if an object had struck it and also showed a corresponding power cut-off at the same time.

Yet the power eventually returned, indicating the wires must have soldered themselves back to their proper connections, Werivras reported.

Still in reference to the same article in Science, it seems both Telstar Communications Satellites had mysterious troubles—Telstar I refused to obey commands from the ground on two occasions.

casions. The first time, Bell Telephone scientists fixed it by remote control, but the second time, in February of 1963, all attempts to fix it failed. The situation looked hopeless until the Satellite began functioning again. Kerchief's comment: "Maybe it's Space Gremlins again."

The Milwaukee Journal for January 30, 1964*carried an article by Journal Staff Writer Harry S. Pease which dealt with Echo's outer space problems.

Gale V. Highsmith Milwaukeee Astronomical Society Satellite Tracker, told Pease on Thursday, January 30, that Echo 2 was not as bright as it was, and something appeared to be going around it* every five seconds. Highsmith said the "whatever it is," seems to come into view beneath the satellite and headed toward the observer, then crosses up and away. It is in orbit, around the satellite, its track would be a mile long and half a mile wide, going a mile per second and that seemed too fast, according to Highsmith.

Highsmith conjectured that perhaps the plastic and aluminum bag had ruptured, spilling out the seven pounds of red-orange phosphorescent dye which was supposed to leave a visible streak. If a leak occurred.

Stating that it is only remotely possible that the dye cloud is in orbit around the satellite, Highsmith thinks there is more likelihood that the dye adhered to the balloon and the orbiting object is merely an optical illusion caused by an "irregular plane job."

The balloon would not collapse if ruptured, due to lack of atmospheric pressure, and the escaping gas would force Echo II into a fast spin.

To date, 14 Rangers or Lunar probes have failed their mission, for various reasons. The latest was Ranger 6, which, like the Milwaukee Sentinel, Gale Highsmith was quick to point out, had no explanation that he saw Ranger 6 crash through his five inch refracting telescope as it was going. The post mortem showed a dark gray spot 2½ miles wide by 5 miles long, lasting about a minute, showing the spot faded out completely in less than two minutes, indicating debris was thrown several miles high.

It is quite obvious that Highsmith saw the Impact area of the Ranger, and if so, what did a Flagstaff Astronomer and a Florida astronomer see? The Flagstaff man, Dr. Kal Rakas, said he saw a brilliant white flash on the Lunar surface 60 miles from the predicted impact point, 50 seconds before Ranger 6 was supposed to impact. The Florida man said he watched what he thought was Ranger 6, go behind the moon.

Ranger 6 was the Lunar probe designed to transmit those photos to earth before impact. Unfortunately the Satellite did not function correctly in the last few crucial minutes and no photos were transmitted. Furthermore, Ranger 6 is the 14th Lunar Probe to fail in its mission to photograph the moon. The only successful one to date is the Russian Lunik of October 1959. According to British spokesman at Jodrell Bank, the Russians are having the same problem—not a single success since the 1959 shot.

And—on February 18, Space Scientists were at a loss to explain the disappearance of Syncom. It had been launched the preceding Thursday from Cape Kennedy. Its ultimate aim was to have been to establish an orbit that would make it appear to hover motionless over a point on the South Atlantic. The launch was routine and it achieved orbit at 22,300 miles but then its radio transmitter came to an abrupt halt. There was no recorded "jolt" as if a meteorite had struck it. In the case of Marine A. Atlar it's launch (and this is not generally known), a Swedish tracking station tracked an object trailing Syncom, and two preceding. It is feasible that the trailing object was the satellite's last stage, but it is not logical that the two objects which preceded Syncom were any part of the launching mechanism. There weeks later, the satellite—all alone now, but with its transmitters still out, was tracked and located via a unique method: Computers aided by Doppler shifts.

And—in March, six mysterious "on-board" satellites were discovered in U.S. and Soviet ownership. They may be telling the truth. Something that we can't quite account for is meddling with our artificial satellites. What?

Walsall saucer

The following account appeared
in the Walsall Observer on
August 21. A mysterious circu-
lar object projecting a beaming
light was seen over Walsall on
Thursday last (August 1). was
reported to the police for investi-
gation. The first reports were
received at Bloxwich police sta-
tion at 11.30 p.m. from Mr. E. E.
Dunn, of 129 Stephenson Avenue,
Bloxwich, and Mr. M. C. Cope,
of 29 Priestly Road, Bloxwich. A
policeman stationed in Stephenson
Square later, was told that while they had been talking
they looked in the sky towards
Willenhall and saw a beaming
red light dancing on and off. Mr.
Dunn told the policeman that it
had been about 6,000 ft. up in
the sky, and had circled Beech-
dale Estate three times. The
object changed from red to blue,
white and remained this colour
before reverting to a bright red.

"It remained stationary two or
three times for periods of 20 to
30 seconds, before moving off
noiselessly from a new behind
Bloxwich fire station, travelling
in the Walsall direction. Both
men were convinced that the
object was not an aircraft. No
11.40 p.m. another report was
received at Walsall police station
from Mr. R. Martin, of 88 Rowan

Road, whose wife had drawn his
attention to an unidentified object
in the sky, circling over the
Bescot area. In both cases noth-
ing was seen by police officers
who had been sent to investigate.

A police spokesman told the
Observer that Walsall was on a
main air traffic lane and the
beaming light could have been
shown by an aircraft.

The English "wave" of sightings continues unabated. The
Daily Sketch an August 2 report says:

For the second night in succession, scores of people believed they saw a mysterious triangular-shaped object in the sky over London and the Home Counties.

The B.B.C. had over 100 calls about it, and the Air Ministry had a considerable number.

Callers to the Ministry were mystified. A spokesman said they could give no explanation.

One man described it as close to the North Star and "brighter than a plane."

On the same day, Three, referring to planes, which took place on August 1 quoted the Air Ministry as saying that a Ministry spokesman is beginning to realize that most such sightings in view of the fact that investigation are becoming more persistent.

5.4.10. Flying Saucer Review - 11-12/63

Diamond shape

The West Herts and Watford
Observer on August 9 reported a
well-attested sighting over Oxhey
which occurred on August 1, the
same day that Mr. David Ogilvy
of the London Flying School saw
an object not far away at his
home at Garston, Herts.—an incident reported elsewhere in this
issue. The Oxhey report runs as
follows:

Fourteen-year-old
Hampden schoolboy John Caswell said he was in the sky last Thursday through his
telescope, bought last October in
the Portobello Road. At least, it
might have been a flying saucer,
but it could have been anything.
John said it was not saucer
shaped and all his friends from
around his home in Oakdale
Road, South Oxhey, agreed that
it was very odd.

"For nearly two hours John
watched it, as the crowd around
him became larger and larger.
It appeared to be stationary, but
with the motion of several
months' plate moving to keep up
that it must be moving to keep up
with the turn of the earth.

Dennis Haisman, 14, John's
next-door neighbour, was among
the observers. 'Very strange,' was
his comment. 'I have never seen
anything like it before.'

John dismissed the idea that
it was a balloon. He had watched
balloons before. He said, and
this was definitely not a balloon.
The object he described was
revolving, solid in the middle,
diamond-shaped and he said he
could see through it at the edges.
As it revolved, he said, it was at
first bright and then dull
alternately."

ROWLEY, Aug. 6 - A low flying meteor about 1000 feet up was reported by Cyril Busher about 9:50 last night. A man of knowledge in many areas, Busher said that the light was about the size of a roman candle and came from the direction of Georgetown out of the northwest 30 degrees up, disappearing into the southeast, appearing like a roman candle object, resembling a roman candle, was about over Rowley depot. It emitted a burst of light and then another.

One whose attention was focused on the rising of the gorgeous moon about 9 o'clock, pondered the thought that well be a tag end of Georgetown's 125th anniversary fireworks celebration.

away to the west," Mrs. Markus
said. "It was long and narrow
and seemed to be about the size
of a pencil and stationary."

Another unidentified flying object has been sighted in Edinburgh. At 4 a.m. today 16-year-old Robert Brown of 14 Loganlea Terrace, a workman, saw Smith's Bakery at Hawkhill, now spinning top with a "flat bottom" hovering over the city.

"I heard a 'wheeling' noise and it was in my vision for two or three minutes," he said. It was twice the size of an aeroplane, but was very slowly," said Robert.

He added: "It was silver and shiny and flying low. It took off, climbing in the direction of Arthur's Seat."

Bilston boy sees saucer

On August 8, the Wolverhampton Express and Star told the following story of a Bilston boy's sighting:    "A mysterious flying object which passed over Bilston late last night startled a 15-year-old boy . . . and his father dialled 999 to tell the police.

The boys, Peter Jones, of 28 Lincoln Street, a pupil at Bilston Grammar School, was in Parkfield Road, Ettingshall, at about 10.30 p.m. when he spotted The Thing.

Three friends with him also saw it as well. The object, he says, was circular in shape, slightly smaller than the moon, and was travelling low in the sky from Wolverhampton towards Bilston.

As it moved slowly along it changed colour from red to pink and then white. It was smaller than an aircraft and erupted a bright trail similar to a rocket.

Today Peter was fishing at Bridgnorth, but his father, Mr. Leslie Jones, told the Wolverhampton Star: 'At first I thought he was pulling my leg, or that perhaps he had seen some moon, balloons from a show or perhaps the lights of an aircraft. But he insisted that it couldn't have been any of these things. He wasn't satisfied until I had told the police and tried to find out if anyone else had seen it.'

"Bilston police say they have not received reports of any other sightings and the object remains unidentified."

My's Lights Chasing Autos

MOUNT VERNON - Those residents over the skies of Mount Vernon have reported strange lights at Mount V.

Former Mayor Harry Bishop, of the lights between 10 and 11 p.m. When the southbound car turned off and stopped, Bishop said, the light started, moved over the auto for some time, and then moved off afterward.

PSIG October 1963

MT. VERNON, ILLINOIS-newspaper...8/9/63 - A fireball as big as a washtub hovered over the home of a former Mt Vernon mayor last night. More flying saucer reports poured into both the police station and sheriff's office during the night as numerous people reported "strange light" objects in the sky.

Harry L Bishop, former mayor who lives at the north edge of town on the Centralia Road, said the fireball he saw "coming right down the Centralia Road from the north" was "the brightest red light I have ever seen." It appeared to be only about 300 or 400 ft high, was oval shaped and was about the size of a washtub, said Bishop.

The ex-mayor said his wife saw the fireball first and called him about 10 p.m. "I could hardly believe my eyes," he said. "It first saw the lighted object following the route of the Centralia Rd.," he said. "Then it got over my house, it stopped and I could see it very clearly, although it was a bright red it did not light up the neighborhood."

Bishop said the fireball then moved westward, went out of sight for a moment "like somebody had turned the light off" and seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. "It seemed to be making a light whirring sound," he said.

His first thought, he said, was that he had better call some neighbors to watch the fireball "or everyone would think I was crazy." "I noticed a strange lighted object," he said. "It stopped suddenly," and the driver jumped out and looked up. He saw the object, too, and it startled him to a stop. Bishop estimated that the fireball was in sight for from ten to 15 minutes.

Mystery Lights Trailing Cars

MOUNT VERNON, Ill. (UPI) - These mysterious lights in the skies over southern Illinois' rural fields have begun chasing cars in Mount Vernon.

Former Mount Vernon Mayor Harry Bishop said he saw one of the lights following a car along the Centralia road between 10 and 11 p.m. When the car stopped, Bishop said, the light stopped. Bishop said the light followed some time and then moved off afterward.

People Watch Sky
For Curious Light

MOUNT VERNON, Ill. (UPI)—People here will be looking
at the sky tonight as they have come to see a mysterious
light.

The "light" is the sky (doesn't do any damage—it just came
and went).

Mayor Harry Bishop said he saw one of the lights
last week between the southbound gas station and Bishop
farm. When the southbound car turned off and stopped, Bishop
said, the light turned, covered over the car and then went off.

Westward, he said, some people have seen the light
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK, residents of Fairfield, 32 miles
east of Mount Vernon, have reported mysterious lights in the
sky.

The Air Force Base at Belleville plans to investigate.

Bishop said the "light" was "bright red, about the size of a
baseball and threw off a glow."

A former army pilot, Robert Trammell, who saw the light,
said it seemed to hover, the same color and intensity as a radio
tower warning light. He said it seemed to be 1,500 feet high.

Some said the light changed color—from red to white to
silver.

Other said the light looked "like a piece of paper with holes
in it."

Sightings of the light have been reported near Flora, north of
Mount Vernon, a flying service operator there said the
light was an advertising sign carried by a plane.

"More Strange lights Seen in All Sky

Mt. Vernon Ill.; Aug 10; 4P.I.

Those mysterious lights in the sky over southwest fall coalfields have begun chasing cars at Mt. Vernon. Residents claim.

I was doing because I noticed the plane was flying quite low in just low enough so that I could read the numbers and see the windows in it. It was a military plane with four motors, and as it neared the area over our back yard, it started making a left turn. Now that was highly unusual to me as all military planes before that day and all planes since then have gone strictly on turn. 

Incidentally, as the plane had completed about a quarter of the turn, or round, a strange engine-flying silver object came from a northwest direction, flew right next to the plane, they moved together for half a minute to a minute, and then this object off in a neutrally direct line faster than any yet I have ever seen. This plane then completed the left turn, went back in the direction

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for July 27, 1963

Saturn Shines Through Night
Saturn, the ringed planet, appearing in the southeast in the constellation of Capricornus, and Jupiter 13 times brighter in the constellation of Pisces, brighten the August sky

By JAMES STOKLEY
▶ THREE and possibly four planets will be visible on August evenings, although only one is shown on the accompanying maps. These show the sky as it will look at 11:00 p.m., your own kind of daylight saving time (or 10:00 p.m., standard time) at the first of August, and an hour earlier in the middle.

Jupiter Appears
By about midnight, daylight time, at the first of August, Jupiter will appear above the eastern horizon. It is about 14 times as bright as Saturn, and in the constellation of Pisces. The star map shows it is shown to the west on our map, but this is not the part of the constellation in which Jupiter is located.

Most, which is far away and dim—like a second magnitude star—is now in Virgo, the virgin part of this group. Also is shown on the map, but Mars is in the part below its actual location. At the beginning of August this will draw nearer the sun in the following weeks, it will disappear from view completely for a time.

And on August 24 Mercury will be at greatest elongation, which means that it remains above the western horizon for a little while after sunset. However, this will not be a very favorable time to see it.

The brightest star visible on August evening will be Vega, in the constellation of Lyra, overhead at the times for which the maps are drawn. Directly east of Lyra is Cygnus the swan, shown partly on the southern sky map, partly on the northern. In it is the bright star Deneb.

South of Cygnus is the interesting little constellation of Sagitta, the arrow, and then the large one of Aquila, the eagle. Altair is the bright star in this group. Together with Vega and Deneb, Altair makes a large triangle that is characteristic of the summer sky.

Two other constellations that are typical of summer are visible now in the southern sky: Sagittarius, the archer, and Scorpius, the scorpion. In the latter you see the brilliant star Antares.

Toward the northwest is the familiar Great Dipper, which is actually part of Ursa Major, the great bear. At the bottom of the dipper are the two stars known as the pointers. A line extended through them upwards and to the right comes to Polaris, the pole star, which is always in the north. If you follow the curve made by the dipper's handle to the left, another star of the first magnitude, Arcturus, in Bootes, the herdsman, can be located.

During the night of Aug. 12, Saturn will be in opposition, directly opposite the sun—and nearest the earth. For Saturn moves in an orbit that is well outside our orbit. Its mean distance from the sun is 887 million miles. This is about 9.5 times the earth's distance from the sun of 929 million miles from the sun. When opposition occurs, as it does this month, the distance between the earth and the sun as Saturn—as we are this month—the two planets are closest. But even then it is a long distance away, about 823.16 million miles.

These rings, like other rings of Saturn, are a swarm of small particles, probably of ice. From our distance, even viewed through a big telescope, they merge into the continuous ring.

That the rings are distinct in shape is shown by the spectroscope, which proves that the inner parts travel around Saturn more rapidly than the outer parts. A solid ring would move like a wheel, with the rim traveling at highest speed.

Until this year, astronomers supposed that the ring system was thin, since they discovered the rings about 250 years ago. But now, when the rings are on edge as seen from earth, They had estimated them to be from ten miles in thickness, but now it seems they are far thinner than that. According to the latest measurements made at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., they are not more than eight inches thick!

Saturn Rings Measured
These scientists studied about a thousand photographs of Saturn taken from South Africa. By photometric means, they measured the brightness of the planet and the rings.

When opposition occurs, at it does this month, the light from the sun that illuminates the rings comes from over our shoulder. Suddenly, at such a time, they get brighter. At other times, we can see the rings less distinctly, and they look more distant, and they look dimmer.

From their measurements of such brightness, Drs. Cook and Franklin concluded that the ice particles are about a thousandth of an inch in diameter and that they occupy about five percent of the total volume of the ring system. And the rings are arranged in a sheet less than eight inches thick!

TWENTY MINUTES OF TERROR
- by Jeanne Stevens -

(Editor's Note: Every year we receive dozens of personal accounts of saucer sightings from our readers. The one that follows was sent to us recently by a young woman who is sincerely trying to describe an event beyond her comprehension. We present it with a minimum amount of editing.)

I recently received a sample copy of your magazine after listening to you on the Long John radio show.

The only encounter I have had with a flying saucer was last summer, while accompanied by my best friend. It was the most frightening and yet the most exciting experience of my entire life.

Last August, my friend Marion Soderstrom invited me to spend the weekend at the estate of her uncle Bill Flagg near Middletown, New York. We spent the afternoon wading in the creek and bird watching. We became so enchanted with the loveliness of a clearing approximately 1/4th mile from the main house, that we decided to camp out under the stars that night.

We got together some blankets, canned fruit, and other supplies, including several orange candles that are specially treated so as to keep mosquitoes away. Being a city girl, I was not used to seeing millions of stars in the sky. There was a moon, and it was quite eerie, with the croaking of the bull frogs and the flickering of the candles.

We were gaily chatting when suddenly we saw what we thought was a shooting star, except that it kept coming closer and closer. Suddenly I became petrified. I thought perhaps it was a meteor, and would crash upon us. The object was very bright and had a white glow to it. It kept coming closer. It was only about 50 feet away. My heart was pounding in fear when it finally stopped. Then it simply hung suspended in the sky, and began to sway. We held each other in fear, for this was totally beyond our knowledge of things. The most terrifying thing of all was that it didn't make more than a slight hum. Even the inventive sounds of the frogs were louder.

Back and forth it swayed, undecided as to whether to go right or left or up or down. Then it came closer. Three separate orange light no bigger than a flashlight. This light began flickering in an odd sort of way. This continued for several minutes until we suddenly became aware of the fact that it was apparently flickering in imitation of our candles. We immediately then put out our candles and threw them into the low brush nearby. The most amazing thing of all was that as soon as the candles were extinguished, the orange light on the saucer went out as well.

The object apparently could see us because of its own radiance, and it followed us for about 20 feet as we crawled desperately through the bushes. It was at this point that we could no longer maintain our composure. We fled in panic toward the main house, screaming to Marion's uncle for help.

As I ran, I looked back for a moment and saw that the saucer was rising slowly, almost as if it was reluctant to leave. Then the humming sound from the object suddenly became louder, almost like the noise of an electric motor. The strange orange light went on again, and the craft sped off toward the southwest, traveling faster than anything I had ever seen before. Within a couple of seconds it had disappeared completely from sight.

Marion and I didn't spend the night under the stars after all. Our terrifying experience with the saucer made us decide that the safety of her uncle's house was far preferable to the uncertainties of the great outdoors. Even so, it was daybreak before we had calmed down enough to go to sleep, and ever since, I have been having occasional nightmares about that strange object.

35-NEW   FLYING SAUCER REVIEW - NO. 125-63

Landing on
Wimbledon Common?

From the Wandsworth Borough News, August 16: "Mr. Briggs, a 28-year-old artist says a police constable told him some weeks ago that a local woman claimed to have seen the flying saucer land, and he would like the woman to get in touch with him."

She reported it to the constable while he was patrolling the common with his dog—but, upon inquiry, he found nothing.

The woman saw it at about 2 a.m. and described it as being the size of a double decker bus and added that she had never seen anything like it before in her life.

The constable asked her what she was doing out at that time of the morning and she replied that, not being able to sleep, she had decided to take a short walk. After her experience he suggested she should return home and go to bed. "Unfortunately," he did not take her name.

Mr. Briggs, but had heard since from other people and they had seen this object flying over the common on the same morning."

Gentlemen:

I have wrote to the Air Force before and got this address from them. I went to [redacted] US Of I started when [redacted] and I were riding home on the bus. He said he saw a flash of light in some woods. I looked and could see nothing. We then kept a look out. I said maybe we'll see it on the other side, so we waited. When we got on the other side of the woods we could see something through the clearing. The closest we got to it was about 15 feet. It was odd shaped. It looked like in part of it was stuck up the ground. We were thinking of asking our bus driver to go back, so we could see it better but we thought we, better not. I said when he got home go down and

The object was about 1½ feet all ways. It was a perfect circle.

See what it was. We said he would. When I got home I called him up. He said it was not this. When we went up the school that next day we talked it over in our club in tree farm. The gods play to watch but fog things like that. They asked us since we didn't tell your bus driver. Probably he wouldn't believe us. We checked seeming home on the bus and there were no signs or anything. I was 13 at this sighting. The Goat Road in Waterloo, New York.

Thank You.
