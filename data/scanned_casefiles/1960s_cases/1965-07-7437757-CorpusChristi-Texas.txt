10. CONCLUSION: BALLOON

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Round silver object size of North Star. Two objects no details, no features observable. Initial sighting at 30 deg elevation 315 deg azimuth. Disappeared at 200 deg on the horizon. Other object disappeared on heading of 200 degrees over the City of Corpus Christi. Object appeared close together initially and separated with light path generally to the SE from the NW. Natives were marked by zig-zag, stopping and accelerating. Reported duration as 15-20 minutes. WX clear with visibility unlimited. Dry air aloft, no inversions.

COMMENTS: Objects apparently not attached yet moving together. Random motion to the East erratic flight. Duration increased to 45 minutes at which time objects disappeared into the Earth's shadow. Flight in accord with Balloon sighting. Possible Balloon check, Holloman Negativ NCAR Palestine Very Remarks.

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    July 26 26 Aug 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Object was clearly defined although very high. It had a distinct metallic glint and changed brilliance only due to reflection of suns rays as it changed direction. I was in sight at all times during the sighting until it finally went into the earth's shadow.

Height should be easily obtained as the 45° angle is very accurate when last seen going into shadow due east from my location at 10:50 pm.

Object must have been very large to be seen so plainly at so great an height. At one time it was motionless for approximately 5 minutes and several times for 1 minute.

Both objects were the same in size. I was most active.

a. How extensive were the turning and zig-zag motions of the objects?

b. When they stopped?

c. How long they were motionless?

d. Were both motionless at the same time?

e. Were both objects exactly the same?

A detailed diagram of the motions and the magnitude of these motions would be helpful.
