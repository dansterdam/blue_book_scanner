34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7-2-65
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Object was clearly defined. It had a distinct metallic appearance and seemed to be very high. It had a distinct motion from side to side, not straight. The motion was not even or smooth. It was a jerky motion. The object was seen for a sufficient length of time to be observed at all times during the sighting. It finally disappeared into the clouds.

Height should be easily within as the 45 degree angle of the sighting shows it was quite a great distance from the observer's location.

object must have been very large to be visible at such a great distance from the observer. Sighting lasted over 1 minute.

The object was metallic appearing and seemed to be highly reflective. It was observed in broad daylight under excellent viewing conditions. The motion observed was not at all like any known aircraft. The extreme height and jerky motion rules out any conventional aircraft.
