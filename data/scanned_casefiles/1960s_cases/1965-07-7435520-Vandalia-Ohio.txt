On the night of July 14, 1965, two children were spending the night outside in the back lawn on their backs, watching the stars when they saw two lights moving across the sky in a zigzag, southwest to northeast. At first, I went outside at 9:30 to check on them. A bright, white point of light was 20,000 out to me. At this time I saw what they were directly overhead. A called TV reports who came out immediately and also observed the objects.

The objects were in sight, only about three minutes, and they were very bright, even artificial-looking. They moved in a zigzag pattern, sometimes hovering, sometimes moving slowly and disappeared above the horizon. They made no noise and did not change course. The objects did not blink or change color. They did seem to get progressively dimmer as they moved on, still they were still quite bright. They were definitely moving in a zigzag pattern. I took a compass reading which showed the direction of the objects as between 45 and 90 degrees.

One other thing should be noted. As they were going overhead, one object followed the other, and they maintained a horizontal direction. The objects, to me, seemed to be between 20 and 30 degrees above the horizon. When the objects began going down on the horizon, the direction gradually changed to a vertical glance. The objects vanished from sight at midnight.

Hq USAF SAFOICC (Attn: SAFOI-WA)
Wash D C 20330

The Vandalia, Ohio observed three unidentified objects on the night of 30 Jul 65 which he reported to the 1st Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. He has requested an evaluation of his observations.

a. The object observed at 1950hrs over Vandalia, Ohio for eleven minutes has been evaluated as UFO I. This satellite was over Dayton at 1904hrs, South of the City, at 500 elevation moving northwest. The Dayton, Ohio, satellite, attitude and characteristics are consistent with this evaluation.

b. Prior to the sighting of UFO I, at 1900, two lights, similar to stars were observed for three minutes flying east. These lights were in formation. No data was presented to indicate that the same observation could not be attributed to flying aircraft.

Dear Mr

The object which you observed over Vandalia, Ohio, on the night of 13 July 1965 at 10:58 p.m. has been evaluated as the satellite, ECHO I.

The two lights which you observed for three minutes flying eastward in formation were probably lights on a high flying aircraft.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:                 Day         Month         Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As is reported in the first set of questions, I had previously seen two objects flying across the sky in a straight line. I discovered that these same have been occasional satellites of some type, possibly a satellite such as Echo or Telstar. Wherever, I talked to some people about an hour later. The time of the first sighting was 9:40 pm at 14:52 N, the second sighting took place. I saw a white object, which was traveling at 90-95 degrees from the North. As near as I can determine, the view of the sighting, this object was high on the western horizon. Went at another moment and his friend to see their parents. After this time, I was certain the object had presented a suspicious nature to be sighted, I focused my 6" telescope on it. The telescope revealed a star, no object, and no object. After the object had passed overhead, it began to move from side to side while remaining its course. When the object was still quite visible, it was about 10 deg. N. of W. and about 45 deg. high in the sky to the south-west of us. The object moved once, then reversed its course, then shortly again, the object began to disappear for several seconds and then reappear. At this time distance, after the 1st disappearance, the object began to make a change in its course, moving a long curving change of course toward the south. It disappeared, then reappeared much more dimly than it had previously shone. It did not appear to have moved. Two persons who saw the object said that it split into two parts at this point. I saw only one object as it reappeared for the last time. The object moved farther down on the horizon, when linked out, it did not reappear.

The object, when it was both visible and moving, was much slower than the stars.

I would appreciate being informed by the Air Force if you are able to find any indication as to what the objects were.

a. The object observed at 10:50pm over Vandalia, Ohio for eleven minutes has been evaluated as NOGO I. This satellite was over Vandalia at 10:41pm, 589° elevation moving Southeast. The description, flight, duration and general characteristics are consistent with this evaluation.

b. Prior to the sighting of NOGO I, at 9:00pm, two lights, similar to stars near Dayton, Ohio, were observed. These lights were in formation. No data was presented to indicate flying objects of this observation could not be attributed to this.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 19 Jul 65

[Partially redacted name] (Dallas) of [redacted] called to report a UFO.

He observed two unidentified objects at approximately 930 pm on 13 Jul 65 and another object that looked like echo around 1100pm except that it suddenly made a curve to the South. First object was observed West to East, moved 35 to 90 degrees of arc, observed for three minutes, was orange in color.

[Redacted name] was not easily understood over the telephone, therefore we asked if he would find filling out a form in order that a better description could be made. [Redacted name] said that would be alright.
