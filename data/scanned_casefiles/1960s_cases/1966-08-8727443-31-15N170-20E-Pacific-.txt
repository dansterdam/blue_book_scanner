This sounds like another recent sighting of a satellite or orbital debris. If so, it is the second incident in the same general area in the last six weeks. It was reported by only one aircraft.

In addition an informal conversation with a pilot who was hitch hiking on a MAC C-124, Wake to Hickam, on the morning of 7 August revealed he saw an object appear on the aircraft's radar. Object appeared ahead of the aircraft at 15 miles and continued forward off the scope at a speed last computed to be approximately 3,600 N.M. There was no visual sighting or crew was not unduly concerned and made no record or report of the incident. It is interesting to note as the UFO reported above.

P.S. Times do not come do with U.S. missile activity.
