Preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting indicated two possibilities: A check of the air traffic flying in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area indicates that the observer may have seen jet exhaust of an aircraft climbing out after takeoff and going away from the observer. The ceilings were approximately 1500 feet in the Philadelphia area and any jet (commercial or otherwise) entering the cloud cover would necessarily disappear. The other possibility was brought out in my conversation with the observer. He noted some advertising searchlights shining in the Philadelphia area approximately at the time of the sighting but did not think that this caused the UFO. However, if the cloud cover over the searchlight area was lower that over the observer, it is felt that the circling light

could have caused a reflection on the clouds. Since the cloud cover was broken the light reflection could have given the observer the orange light and size and shape of the object. No further information is available at this time.
