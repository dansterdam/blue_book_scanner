ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA     PI: BURTON     DATE: 20 JAN 66

Analysis was requested on a 35mm slide containing three light-toned images similar in appearance, taken west of Guadalajara, Mexico. Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division (TDPA) and Photo Processing Division (TDPP) with the following results:

No discernible signature could be derived from the images noted on the film. It is 16 felt that the images were probably caused by a ray of sun, in a low oblique position, being reflected from some portion of the inner surface of the camera, or possibly from the lens shade if one was used.

Unidentified Flying Objects Division
Wright Patterson Airforces Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am enclosing a slide which has on it 3 unidentified flying objects.

About a month ago my son in law, D [redacted] and daughter [redacted] were traveling in Mexico. They went west of Guadalajara, to the Pacific coast, and took pictures, including the enclosed. The enclosed was in a primitive area, where they took pictures of a river and primitive village beside the stream.

They saw no aircraft, heard no aircraft, and were sure they were far from any beaten path.

When we were watching the slides, we were surprised to see on this slide the 3 objects. I have shown them to several people, also had 2 5 by 7 enlargements made, and looked at them via microscope. No one could identify them.

I am enclosing the slide, which you may want to have an enlargement made altho I would like to know about it, if you were to give it publicity.

[redacted] is a well known teacher from Eastern Kentucky Teachers College and has never been interested in flying objects, nor has his wife.

They wouldn't have made an enlargement or said anything, but I thought it should be followed up to some conclusion.

Please inform me if there is any explanation for the objects.

Sincerely

Rev [redacted]

P.S. I have been an army chaplain and have Major reserve commission from W 2.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a rocky or mountainous landscape with varying textures and shades of gray. The photograph seems somewhat degraded or low quality, with significant graininess and contrast variations.
