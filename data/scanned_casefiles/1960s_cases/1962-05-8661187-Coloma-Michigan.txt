On May 4, 9:13 p.m. as I was unloading groceries
from our car when I sighted the object in the
western sky. Pausing momentarily to note the sky
was not green, it seemed on the theory that it
might be a visitor from any earthly planet
and would accept any studies this report
might of Air Force has if properly verified
and proven.
