Here is the text from the document:

Ind/SAFOIC/7284c/24 Nov 65

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you observed and were unable to identify on 17 August 1965.

The object which you observed has been evaluated as a meteor, not a satellite as you suggested. Satellites have much slower speeds than the object which you observed. All known satellites have an easterly component in their direction of flight.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 17 Aug 65, Ottawa, Illinois

TO: Hq USAF SAFOINC (M)
Wash DC 20330

Reference the attached letter from requesting
information on his unidentified observation of 17 Aug 65.
His observation is characteristic of a meteor. Duration of
15 seconds is rather long, however, the object did traverse
more than 30 degrees of arc. Satellite observations have
apparent speeds much slower than that of the object which
might be observed. Also, all known satellites have orbital
characteristics of an Easterly component and none present a
flight to the West of the North-South axis.

Some words and phrases are partially illegible or difficult to read with complete certainty. The text appears to be a handwritten note, possibly part of a report about an observation.

The text on the page is partially legible. The top portion contains handwritten text that appears to read:

"to see, after NHs then

At the bottom of the page, there is some printed text, but it is mostly cut off or illegible. The only partially readable text appears to be:

"AUG 19,1965"

The rest of the document is blank or white space.
