10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Comet-like obj with small point of SW. When in hover trail will disappeared, became egg-in-doughnut-shape. Size of head of a line. Diameter appeared equal to length of B-52 fuselage. Overall size larger than a blimp. Color was golden in flight; trailed brown when in a hover. Trail appeared to be twice the size of obj. First appeared ill-timed. Appeared and disappeared several times.

11. COMMENTS
First magnitude star Altair was just below horizon and was probably able to be seen only due to the inversion which was in area at time. It is possible that a/c in area contributed somewhat to sighting, but it is believed that star was real culprit. Consistency of times, directions and descriptions on subsequent nights substantiates this conclusion.
