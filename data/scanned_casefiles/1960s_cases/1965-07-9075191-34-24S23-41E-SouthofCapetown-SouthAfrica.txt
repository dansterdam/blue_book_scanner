Dear Col. de Jonckheere:

Your letter of 20 August 1965, requesting information on a UFO sighting on 2 July 1965, has been forwarded to this office for action. A check of NASA's records shows no sounding rocket or "Sodium Shot" activity on that date.

One spent rocket body, 1965 30, launched by the USSR on 23 April 1965, decayed from orbit on 2 July 1965. However, NORAD records indicate that the time of this decay was 0342 GMT, plus or minus ten minutes. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has no likely explanation for the UFO sighting in question.

Sincerely yours,
