11. COMMENTS
    One witness - insufficient data. The
    witness was observing Andromeda. The
    constellation was on the horizon at this
    time to the NE. The witness was looking
    over the Rhine river through Binoculars.
    It is probable that a mirage of some sort
    was being observed. The objects were
    distinct and the duration of the sighting
    extremely short.
