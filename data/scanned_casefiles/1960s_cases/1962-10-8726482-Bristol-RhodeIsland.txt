On Monday, 22 October he told Mr. Souza, his science teacher, that while walking home from school he saw something in the incident and that his teacher said he was making it up. He started to tell his teacher that he was not making it up and that he took a small piece about three yellow wood about the size of a marble that the middle of the object was like a bubble that looked like the bottom of a bottle. He added that he was going to show it to his teacher at Newport, Rhode Island where he was.

ACTION: AFCSC FOR SCTA, LIFO, AFCIL-182 AND BSD (EST). SUBJECT IS MOON DUST. THIS MESSAGE IS FOUR PARTS. PART I. REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE TWO SAMPLES RECOVERED IN THE AREA OF BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND, 20 OCTOBER 1962. ONE SAMPLE WAS WHITE IN COLOR AND THE OTHER BROWN. PART II. THE SAMPLE WHICH IS WHITE IN COLOR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BEING SIMILAR TO U.S. NYLON 66. THE SAMPLE WHICH IS BROWN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS POLYESTER. A CREAM COLORED INCLUSION WITHIN THE BROWN SAMPLE WAS IDENTIFIED AS POLYETHYLENE. THIS WAS IN THE FORM OF A BALL AND ACTUALLY DISPERSED WITHIN THE BROWN SAMPLE. PART III. THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF THESE SAMPLES INDICATE STRONGLY THAT THEY ARE THE "TAILINGS" OR "END-OF-RUN" FROM EXTRUSION MACHINES PRODUCING PLASTIC FORMS OR FOILS, SUCH "SCRAP" OR DISCARDED MATERIALS.

BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND                    20 October 1962                    PLASTIC

Two youths, age 11, informed their science teacher at school that they had observed a gray object falling from the sky on 20 Oct 62 with a whooshing sound, and landing in the sand about 20 ft from them. One of the youths claimed the touched the object and it was warm, so he did not pick it up. The teacher suggested that they bring the object to him. This object was turned over to authorities at the U S Naval Base, Newport, Rhode Island. The object was then turned over to the Air Force for analysis. The samples were identified as being similar to US Nylon, Number 66, a brown sample was identified as polysterene and the cream colored inclusion within the brown sample was identified as polyethylene. The appearance of these samples indicate strongly that they are the "tailings" or "end-of-run" from extrusion machines producing plastic forms or foils. Such "scrap" or discarded materials are often seen in just this type of physical form and condition. The materials named above are all common and widely used plastic materials. Tests have indicated that none of the samples have been exposed to a space environment or have been used in relation with any space application.

The material was compared with known waste material from extrusion processes of industries in the local areas utilizing nylon, etc, in the manufacture of insulated wire and cable, and found to be of similar appearance and consistency.

MEMORANDUM

From: W. SIMONE, SA, PTC, Newport, Rhode Island
To: CIO-DIO, DCS, Nuremberg, Massachusetts
Subject: Unidentified mass observed falling onto the Beach near the mouth of the Warren River, Bristol, Rhode Island on 30 Oct 1962

1. On 25 October 1962, Major POLLION, USMC, NAS, received information from Mr. CLIFFORD, who stated that two small pieces of grayish tubular material found on the beach, after being analyzed, were claimed to be pieces of a missile. Major POLLION had submitted these materials to Naval Intelligence, Rhode Island, who advised that these pieces of material were brought to Naval Air Station, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and the Ordnance and Repair Department for analysis. He further stated that the Q&R Department advised him that the material was "plastic" or "some substance".

2. CDR RUNYON was interviewed on 25 October 1962 by telephone. He repeated substantially the same information given by Major POLLION and added that he felt that the material might have some relation to a solid rocket propellant. He stated that the mass of material emitted a glow, and upon initial light examination, was mingled in the mass, that it looked like a bunch of spaghetti.

Special Agent Peter DERESTE was requested to obtain the material from CDR RUNYON if possible and retain it for further investigation.

On 25 October 1962, Mrs. [name blacked out] whose name and telephone number was furnished by CDR RUNYON, was interviewed by telephone. She was questioned whether or not her son had witnessed any of the material. She would not definitely state whether he would touch her son's return home, and would advise PTC, Newport.

Bristol, R.I. who identified himself at Providence, R.I. telephone station PTC-Newport on 25 October 1962 at 2008, Mr. [name blacked out] also eleven years of age 20 October 1962, stated that he was in Bristol, R.I. that when his father came home he spoke of hearing a "whooshing sound" and saw a very bright flash. The next morning 30 feet away in the sand, he went to touch it and found that [text becomes illegible]

BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND                                20 October 1962                                PLASTIC

Two youths, age 11, informed their science teacher at school that they had observed a grey object falling from the sky on 20 Oct 62 with a "whooshing" sound, and landing in the sand about 20 ft from them. One of the youth claimed that he touched the object and it was warm, so did not pick it up. The teacher suggested that they bring the object to him.

The object was turned over to the U S Naval Base, Newport, Rhode Island. The object was then turned over to the Air Force for analysis. The samples were identified as being similar to US Nylon, Number 66, a brown sample was identified as polystyrene and the cream colored inclusion within the brown sample was identified as polythylene. The appearance of these samples indicated strongly that they are "tailings" or "end-of-run" from extrusion machines producing plastic forms or foils.

Such "scrap" or discarded materials are often seen in just this type of physical and condition. The materials named above are all common and widely used plastic materials. Tests have indicated that none of the samples have been exposed to a space environment or have been used in relation with any space application.

The material was compared with known waste material from extrusion processes of industries in the local areas utilizing nylon, etc, in the manufacture of insulated wire and cable, and found to be of similar appearance and consistency.

TELECON W. F. JACOCKS, ET AL FROM D. S. FALINGAS
NOVEMBER 14, 1962

CLASSIFICATION WILL BE ASSIGNED AT THE END OF TOG

THIS IS IN CONFIRMATION OF MY G-29 DATED NOV. 13. PLASTIC SAMPLE
DESIGNATED AS WHITE WAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS SIMILAR TONYLON 66.
PLASTIC SAMPLE BROWN WAS IDENTIFIED AS POLYSTYRENE WITH THE BLACK
SAMPLE BEING WAS SOME ORANGE MATERIAL AND IT WAS ALSO POLYSTYRENE
ALSO WITHIN THE BROWN SAMPLE THERE WAS A LARGE SPECIMEN OF CREAM
COLORED PLASTIC AND IT WAS TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED AS POLYETHYLENE. THIS WAS
THE FORM OF BALL AND ACTUALLY DISPERSED WITHIN THE BROWN SAMPLE. THERE
WAS NO INDICATION THAT THESE METAL WERE IN RELATION WITH ANY
SPACE APPLICATION. THE SAMPLES APPEARED TO BE MATERIALS THAT CAME OUT
OF AN EXTRUSION MACHINE AND WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS SCRAP. ALSO
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF RUBBER AND RUBBER TAPE WAS MADE AND WAS
FOUND THAT ALL COMMENTS OF REPORT WERE IN LINE WITH NATURAL
RUBBER. THE CORD IN THE TAPE WAS MADE OF COTTON.

MR JACOCKS/COL FRIEND-----

OK THANKS VERY MUCH THIS COINCIDES CLOSELY WITH OUR ON THE SPOT
GUESS.
