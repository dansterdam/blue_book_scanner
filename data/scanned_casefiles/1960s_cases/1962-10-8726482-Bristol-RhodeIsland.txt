Text from the document:

On the evening of 8 October 1962, the object was sighted
over Bristol, Rhode Island. The witness, described as a
reliable and respected individual, stated that the object
appeared as a bright light in the sky, estimated to be
about the size of the old moon. It was observed for
approximately 20 minutes as it moved across the sky.
The witness reported that the object suddenly stopped,
hovered, then made a sharp turn and disappeared at a
high rate of speed. No further details were provided.

ONE SAMPLE WAS WHITE IN COLOR AND THE OTHER BROWN. PART II. THE SAMPLE WHICH IS WHITE IN COLOR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BEING SIMILAR TO U.S. SILICA GG-17. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AS POLYETHYLENE. THIS IS IN THE FORM OF A BALL AND ACTUALLY DISINTEGRATED WITHIN THE BROWN SAMPLE. THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF THESE SAMPLES INDICATE STRONGLY THAT THEY ARE THE "TAILS G" OR "END-OF-RUN" PICK EXTRUSION MACHINES PRODUCING PLASTIC CORES OR FILAMENTS. SUCH MATERIAL IS DISCHARGED AS "SCRAP" OR "RESIDUALS".

BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND 20 October 1952 PLASTIC
Two youths, age 11, informed their science teacher at school that they had observed a strange object falling from the sky on 5 October 1952 with a parachute-like descent, and landing in a sand about 20 ft from them. One of the youths claimed that he touched the object and said it was cold. The weather bureau at Providence, Rhode Island, analyzed this and concluded that the object was then turned over to the Air Force for analysis. The samples were identified as light colored plastic objects about 2 inches in diameter, and were considered to be the plastic from balloons, probably from the manufacture of inexpensive toy balloons made of polyethylene. The appearance of these samples indicate strongly that they are the result of the separation of plastic forms used in the manufacture of these toy balloons under the proper atmospheric conditions and condition. The materials named above are all common and widely used plastic materials. There have indicated that more of these samples have been reported to space environments.
The material was compared with known waste material from extrusion processes of industries in the local area utilizing nylon, etc, in the manufacture of limited wire and cable, and found to be of similar appearance and consistency.

MEMORANDUM
PROJECT 10073 RECORD
THROUGH: Director, AFSPR 
FROM: Major H. I. Shaw, Director, Inteliligence, OSAF
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Bristol, Rhode Island, 20 October 1952

1. Subj: On 20 October 1952, at approx 2200 local time, the watch officer at the Rhode Island Air National Guard Headquarters, T-26, Hillgrove, Rhode Island, called the ATIC, Dayton, Ohio, and reported the observation of a UFO.

2. Details: The watch officer stated that at approx 2200 local time, his attention was directed to a bright, white, pulsing light in the sky to the southwest of T-26. The light was observed for approx 20-25 minutes. During this period, the light appeared to move slowly in a northerly direction, stopped, reversed its direction and moved slowly back to the southwest, then again reversed direction and moved north.

3. At approx 2215 local time, the light appeared to increase in brilliance, separate into two distinct parts which continued to pulse, and then merge back into one light source. The light source was observed to dim and then brighten again several times during the period it was under observation.

4. The watch officer advised that the weather was clear, with unlimited visibility, and that there was no cloud cover in the area. He also stated that the light source appeared to be at a considerable altitude and that no sound was detected.

5. The watch officer was advised that ATIC would conduct an investigation of the reported incident.

BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND 20 October 1962 PLASTIC

TWO youths, 14 and 11, informed their science teacher at school that they had observed a dark colored, flat, circular object in the sky while on their way from school. It was observed for about 5 minutes and landed in a field nearby. It was warm, so he did not pick it up. The teacher suggested that they bring the object in, but they declined due to the warmth of the object. The object was identified as being similar to US Nylon, number 66, a brown sample was identified as being polyvinyl chloride material which was found throughout the residue. The object had a "end-of-run" from extrusion machines producing plastic forms or foils. Such "end-of-run" material could contain unusual forms and characteristics and have indicated that some of the samples have been exposed to a space environment.

The material was compared with known waste material from extrusion processes or industries and found to be of a similar nature. The material was examined for any unusual properties or radioactivity which were not detected.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document describing an observation made by a person named Jacocks. The document appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report, as indicated by the header "CLASSIFICATION WILL BE ASSIGNED AT THE END OF FORM THIS IS CONTINUED MAN'S ATTEMPT TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THE SKY".

The text in the document is as follows:

"THIS IS CONFIRMED HAS MANY SIMILARITIES BASIC SIGHTING. THE OBJECTS 1 APPEARED TO FALL DOWN GRADUALLY LANDED ESTIMATED ABOUT 150 YARDS AWAY. THERE WAS SOME ORANGE MATERIAL AND IT WAS ALSO PHOSPHOR ESCENT. THE OBJECT TOOK OFF AGAIN VERTICALLY.
THE FORM OF OBJECT WAS ROUND AND AS WELL AS TALL. THERE WAS A LUMINOUS QUALITY TO IT. THE ONLY INDICATION OF MATERIAL STRUCTURE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE GLASS PANELS. IT REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR A PERIOD BEFORE TAKING OFF VERTICALLY.
DURING INITIAL OBSERVATION OBJECT APPEARED ROUND AND WELL DEFINED. IT WAS GLOWING AND WAS MADE OF NATURAL RUBBER. THE CORD IN THE FIRE WAS MADE OF COTTON. 
MR JACOCKS SPECIAL FRIEND--
GUESS MANS VERY MUCH THIS COINCIDES CLOSELY WITH OUR OWN THE SPOT."
