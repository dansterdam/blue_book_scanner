INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

It was 20 minutes until 5 A.M. I had just sit down in the car, ORD's 442 HARDTOP 67 MODEL, started the engine pulled on the parklight then turned to the right to look before backing out of the driveway. As I turned I saw it there the right down gears, I turned off the lights, turned off the engine got out and watched until I had to sundown or up the street (south) to pop it in gear. It was so low that it was about to go behind a story and a half home (1½ story) across the street from me. I watched it until it propel over the terrain from me, I'm my judgement in the direction of Cincinnati.

Later I checked a map and I would seem to me that this object would have been traveling in the same direction over IR 71 and I believe about that distance from me, something like Springfield, O. to Cincinnati, O.

I am sure that if you could just now see that was traveling South west on IR 71 and that 4:40 AM they would be able to give you a good and lengthy description yet perhaps a high way patrol car, although I reported this to the Dayton Post and the local P.D. and their has been no other sightings, my reporting was some within 1/2 hour of the sighting.

Memo for the Record

Sighting of 27 Jan 68
Telephone conversation of 15 Feb 68
Wallops Island Station

Mr. [redacted] have gotten photos of the obj. at first Mr. [redacted] thought the photos were the result of static electricity. However because of the coincidence that the plates are for the correct time period; that static usually occurs on more than just two plates; and that there was a bright obj. that was sighted by two of the guards, he is no longer sure that the plates are of static. The biggest reason that Mr. [redacted] thought the plates were of static is that the two diff. plates should overlay if the photos are of meteor or of a satallite re-entry. Mr. [redacted] said that he would give us a written statement of the occurrence if we requested it.

He also said he would give the two guards, [redacted] and [redacted] 177 if we sent them to him.

The photos have been forwarded to Dr. McCrosky at the Smithsonian but Mr. [redacted] will have copies sent to us.

Here is the text from the document:

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

6 Feb. 1968

Talked to Mr. Hurst of the Smithsonian. Mr. Hurst stated that the obj. is not a correlated satellite re-entry but that the obj. could be a meteor.

Also talked to Mr. Wadsworth of the Univ. of Colo. The direction of the obj. was roughly toward the SE and has a duration of approx. one min.

Wallops Island Meteorological station has a photo and a spectrum of the obj. There were reports from Raleigh N. C.

Knoxville Tenn. (New Sentinel--talk to Mike Butler)

Called Wallops Island Meteorology station, and talked to Mr. Chamberland.

He stated that Claude Lipton who works for the Smithsonian took the pictures.

Called Charleston, Huntington, and Clarksburg West Va. police departs.

None of these cities received UFO reports on the 27th.

Talked to Lt. Stubbs at ADC, an analyst for SPADA TS. He will return the call if he is interested.

at first I thought it was a "shooting star". I jumped out of the car ran up the street to keep it on a mirror pointing. It was not what I first thought. Bright, long-tail of light (like fire) nothing uncommon in a place such as this. I was just. As it went out of sight, I part me if I could see longer the smaller end of it mostly away from me (sun light). I could not make out the object making the sky of it. I was sometimes there, my attention was drawn to the light. The object appeared to be close to me, I could see no combination of the object itself.
