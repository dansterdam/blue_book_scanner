Dear Sirs,

On Sunday morning, April 25, 1965, we observed what we feel to be an unidentified flying object, or what is commonly called a "flying saucer".

The time was approximately 11:55 a.m. and the object appeared to be about four or five miles distant from our position (we were in the southwest quadrant of the said-Dade Junior College campus, near 32nd Ave. and 110th st., Miami, Florida).

The object appeared white and from our position looked about an inch across.

It came out of the west and moved eastward until it seemed directly in front of us. The point then appeared to hover about thirty seconds and then continued eastward until it was over the Atlantic Ocean, as well as it could be determined into the clouds.

Through the entire sighting the object remained below the clouds, until its disappearance into them. The sighting lasted about 3 min.

We would appreciate your forwarding a copy of PID Form 164 so that we may make our report to you as complete as possible.

Very cordially yours,
