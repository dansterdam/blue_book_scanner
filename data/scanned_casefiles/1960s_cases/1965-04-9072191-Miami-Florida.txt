The text in the document reads:

Project Blue Book Information Office
Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear Sir:

On Sunday morning, April 3, 1965, we observed what appears to be an unidentified flying object or "cause". The object was approximately 115Â° S.E. and the object appeared to be about four or five miles distant. The object was seen from our position (we were standing on the beach) and appeared to be white and from our position looked about the size of a man's thumb held at arm's length.

The object appeared white and from our position looked about the size of a man's thumb held at arm's length.

It came into view and moved eastward until it disappeared. It remained in view for approximately 10 seconds and then continued eastward until it was over the ocean and disappeared from view.

We would appreciate your forwarding a copy of any UFO data you may have on file which reports this incident or a similar one which may have occurred in this area on or about April 3, 1965.

Very truly yours,
