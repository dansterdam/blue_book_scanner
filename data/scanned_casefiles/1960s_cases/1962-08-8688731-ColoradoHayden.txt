Here is the text from the document:

Aug. 6

Hayden, Colo. PO
Office of Sec'y of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

About mid night during the week of Aug. 6, Something finger of top car size - passed thru the sky near Rabbit Ear Pass in Colo. The front end was round like a huge ball, and fiery red; the long tail seemed to be flames or sparks; it made a loud swish - and was gone.

It was close to earth; at the time I was sure I felt pressure from it after it passed; it must have landed not too many hundred miles from here.

My companions were safe, but I was afraid of the bears. We have about 800 of them in the Routt Co. National Forest.

The next morning they ribbed me lightly, like, "You been out in the sun too long?"

But some of the folks I told about it, said I should tell you, so there it was.

Yours very truly
Mrs [redacted] (aged 60 years)

P.S. I wondered if it might have been part of the [partially illegible text] of the [illegible text] Huntley & David Brinkley [rest of postscript text is difficult to fully decipher]
