10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Scintillating obj like a star observed w/erratic movement for 15 mins. Obj appeared as a light bright as the stars. Flickering, changes in brightness and disappearing and reappearing included. In observation. Yellow, no sound. Interpreted from letter in French.

11. COMMENTS
ECHO visibility in area at this time. Also direction tends to eliminate this possibility. A/C would not be in the area at this time unless it was a glider or light plane and time of day tends to rule this out. Possibly a balloon sighting, however the data in the translation is insufficient data for analysis.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft

Gentlemen:

I have the honor of sharing a discovery with you. I believe in flying saucers and I am interested in the "Project Blue Book."

I am reporting to you that on Tuesday, the 24th of April, French time - 0Â°15, a companion and I noted a curious phenomenon in the sky.

Imagine a star of average brightness moving across the sky. This star, of yellowish light, appeared distinctly to fade out and then light up again irregularly. The object moved in zigzag fashion, in any direction, absolutely confused.

I came up with different hypotheses:

Could it be an airplane? No, an airplane has several lights. An airplane flies straight. Besides, there was no perceptible sound.

A weather balloon? No, because a balloon does not light up and fade out intermittently. Besides, there was no wind.

An artificial satellite? No, because a satellite goes straight.

A shooting star? A shooting star also has a rectilinear trajectory, and a shooting star does not light up again.

Afterwards the object disappeared in the night. We have thought that it was a case of a "UFO." If you think that that is what it was will you let us know about it (The address is on the back of the letter.). If you think that it is something else, explain it to us!

Thank you,

France
