34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    23   FRI.   JUNE    1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

FIGURES ON EXACT TIME OF SIGHTING & DURATION OF SIGHTING CANNOT BE EXACT- ALTHOUGH ALL OTHER FEATURES REMAIN CLEAR IN MY MIND.

ALSO   THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SIGHTED WAS AT   RIGHT ASCENSION- 19.60
                                    DECLINATION- 36.0

WHEN LOST FROM VIEW IT WAS
        RIGHT ASCENSION- 19.0
        DECLINATION- 18.0

I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO USING MY NAME IN ANY STATEMENT THAT IS NECESSARY

THERE SEEMED TO BE 2 CLEAR LINES OF LIGHT ABOVE AND BELOW THE OBJECT - PLUS 1 INDISTINCT LINE LEADING IT. I COULD DETECT NO TRAIL OR LINES IN BACK OF THE OBJECT.
COULD THE JERKY MOTION I OBSERVED ALSO BE MOMENTS OF MY EYE?

THE OBJECT MOVED FROM NORTH OF VEGA IN THE DIRECTION OF ANTARES

GENTLEMEN:

I AM SENDING THIS LETTER TO FILL ON SOME FACTS WHICH I REALIZED I OMITTED IN A PREVIOUS REPORT OF A UFO SIGHTING ON MAY13,1967.(I HAVE SENT A LETTER TO YOU WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OBJECT). HERE ARE ALL THE DETAILS I CAN REMEMBER:

1. DURATION OF SIGHTING------- APROX. 7 MIN.

2. NO. OF OBSERVER(S AS FAR AS I KNOW)------ 1, MYSELF.

3. NO. OF OBJECTS------ ONE.

4. SHAPE----- OVAL, FLATTENED.

5. DIMENSIONS------- WHEN COMPARED WITH MOON,SEEMED TO A LENGTH OF APROX. THE WIDTH OF A QUARTER MOON.

6. COLOR------ APPEARED YELLOW WHITE,WITH TWO FAIRLY BRIGHT LIGHTS,ONE IN THE FORWARD NOSE, THE OTHER, NEAR THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT, ALTHOUGH IT WAS ALL ILLUMINATED.

7. ALTITUDE-------- IT SEEMED TO BE AT 10,000 FEET, BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO TELL.

8. SPEED------ AT PEAK SPEED TIMES, IT SEEMED TO BE TRAVELLING TWICE THE TOP SPEED OF AN F/100 JET FIGHTER, THESE ARE BASED A FEW MILES FROM HERE AT A TESTING INSTALLATION CALLED N.A.F.E.C.

9. TACTICS ------ MOVED PRIMARILY LIKE A FALLING LEAF, BUT SOMETIMES MAKING DASHES AT TERRIFIC SPEEDS IN A GENERAL FLIGHT PATH (N.W.) THAT BROUGHT IT OVER THE OCEAN.


- page 3 -

THERE IS ONE LAST FACT I FAILED TO MENTION, ON EITHER SIDE
AND ON THE TAIL END OF THE UFO WERE LINES OF LIGHT PARALLEL TO THE
CRAFT (EXCEPT FOR THE TAIL LINE) WHICH MOVED RIGHT ALONG WITH THE
OBJECT. I NOTED NOFLUCTUATIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT SOURCE.

I HOPE SINCRLY THAT YOU GIVE THIS REPORT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION
FOR I FEEL IT TO BE IMPORTANT, AND DON'T WRITE IT OFF IMMEDIATELY
AS A USUAL OBJECT SEEN UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR IT RESEMBLED
NO "USUAL" OBJECT I COULD THINK OF. AND IF YOU THINK THE PHOTO IS
A HOAX, WELL, IT WOULD SEEM YOU ARE "HOAX CRAZY" WHICH I DON'T THINK
YOU ARE. THERE ARE PROBABALY OTHER FACTS I COULD REMEMBER IF ASKED
ABOUT, SO I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU WOULD SEND ME A QUESTIONNAIRE
THAT I COULD FILL OUT. I THINK MY RELIABILITY IS GOOD BECAUSE
I AM AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER, AND I AM USED TO NOTING WEAK PLANETARY
DETAIL.     I WILL ENCLOSE A GENERAL FLIGHT PATTERN OF IT, AND
WILL NOTE SPEED AT DIFFERENT POINTS.

THANK YOU,

MAY 15, 1967

GENTLEMEN:

I AM WRITING IN REFERENCE TO A UFO (OR WHAT I BELIEVE IS ONE) SIGHTING. THIS SIGHTING OCCURRED ON MAY 15, 1967. ON THAT NIGHT I WAS CONTINUING A PROJECT OF PHOTOGRAPHING THE MOON'S SURFACE DURING DIFFERENT PHASES, WHEN A SWERVING LIGHT ATTRACTED MY EYE. I ESTIMATE THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT AT ABOUT 10,000 FEET. IT WAS A YELLOW WHITE OVAL SHAPED OBJECT, MOVING IN SPURTS, AND OCCASIONALLY STOPPING. AFTER GETTING OVER THE ORIGINAL SHOCK, I REMEMBERED THE CAMERA AND TAKING IT FROM THE MOUNT I WAITED TILL IT STOPPED AND PHOTOGRAPHED IT. I DID THIS TWICE. BRINGING THEM TO BE DEVELOPED I REALIZED I HAD USED A RELATIVELY SLOW FILM (ASA 125) AND A SHORT EXPOSURE (1/25 OF A SECOND).. I WAS STARTLED TO FIND OUT THAT I GOT A DETAILED PHOTO OF IT. I HAD RECORDED THE TIME JUST BEFORE THE SIGHTING, SO I KNEW THE EXACT TIME. THE TIME WAS 9:30P.M..

THEIR ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKED ANSWERED:
1. WERE THERE ANY FLIGHTS OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, MOVING IN A N.W. HEADING, AT THAT TIME?
2.WAS THEIR A SATELLITE PASSAGE? (THE JERKY MOTION IF SO?)
3. COULD YOU (IF YOU CAN) SAY IF THERE WAS A RADAR CONTACT ON THAT OBJECT?
4. I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE OBJECT, I HAVE SENT YOU A COPY, COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT, YOU'RE THE EXPERTS, YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL ME.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME, PLEASE RETURN THE PICTURES, WITH THE ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS, THANK YOU, (YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB)
SINCERELY, ROBIN A. WHITE

oval that had two high intensity bands of light, one in the front
and one in the center. There were horizontal lines or light above
and below the craft and one vertical line behind it.

Your letters dated December 28, 1967 and January 2, 1968

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In answer to your first letter of December 28, 1967, although it is true that Ronson Helicopters, Inc. has an aerial advertising sign, this sign has not been used for about two years and it is not contemplated that it will again be used. As a matter of fact, we are attempting at the present time to sell this particular sign.

I think the above answers your letter of January 2, 1968. We were not in Atlantic City at that time.

We will be pleased to be of any additional service for you if possible. We would also like to request for our own purpose the names and addresses of aerial sign operators in the United States.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I am writing you because I have not heard any results or conclusions on the investigation of the UFO observed on 13, Nov. Could you please send me the results of the investigation, or the progress of it? Also, could you might be interested to know that during a recent project of mine of making a star chart of the sky using photographs, I observed on several nights "Y" shaped collection of lights. At first I thought they were just stars with light being reflected from them, but I ruled this out by there meteoric space. I even managed to catch one on film(but I did not observe it) in the constellation Orion, 2 degrees east of MK2. If you want this photograph I will send it at your request. It can be easily proven as genuine by the sharpness of both the lights and of the stars of the constellation, indicating that it was not very close.

Thank you for your valuable time.

Sincerely,

[Name redacted]
