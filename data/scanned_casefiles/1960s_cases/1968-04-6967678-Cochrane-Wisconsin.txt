us - occupy by I person - a turn - satellite
other a 65-68 job. - we continued on just the hwy peak. at the new crossing the
I asked me what time it was - it was 8:10 +

coming from Studland. I noticed a car come
down the hwy - near the Prairie Morn rest it
passed we - to 60 Fred lights blue wagon -
another car was coming out from the Prairie
Morn rest - not yet got to the hwy. yet.

Then up the hwy up this time the Ford which
was going for fast at least 65-70 or 75
just had no lights in the hwy - none at all.
At the same moment that this came from
the dip in the hill - next fact but very next
almost like something going but down
own way plane + hovered & stopped above
this car. This is when lights went out. and I
pulled onto the road became of things it was
in hill & the jolt out his lights and I did. I
went to passed what I saw at all on this hwy
- we dimming slightly, but I did. I think
not quite stopped - when lights a radio went
it up that car & came down the hwy it more
plain - yet as smooth it was just - this is
watch the other car after that became the object
came down the hwy & was above us - it came
down over the hill can. I saw the mill lights on
Cochrane - the X the mill - the thing & and
the telephone poles. It was pretty low.

When I looked, out of my window (shield)

I find to bend forward toward the wheel - looked straight up and there it was above us - with the car dead - I had opened the window when the other cars lights went out - it was open then - absolutely. One sound. The sky in my car was on Kewaunee after this thing drew over the field toward Kewaunee. I tried my car to I had the ground - grind - finally about the 3rd or 4th time it went (the car) - then the car started of itself to get away on or no car in front of me - the thing started back or us - Told Marie to watch so I could know where it was - when the thing moved its course go up - down and side ways (the way it came at me) and in some motion - the thing when it stood still was a citation range color and less bright - had clearly pitch around it - when it was moving the light was brighter - pulsies - it was and a glowing light like one lights it just lets up - the thing had a finish white color in the light but only when stone was. It had us freezing - as body point this off-eye. It was stable - yet not about point there. Black. I was just interested in the shape of staying its distance from the lights. I was calm this whole time until the thing started to come back to us from the field - then I began to outside for when the car was going full as times - I wasn't cold with the window open.

4 Apr 1968
Cochrane, Wisconsin

On 4 Apr 1968 at about 8:15 p.m. CST, the observer and her young son were driving on Route 35 about 4 miles south of Cochrane, Wisconsin when the lights of the car ahead went out. The observer then sighted an orangish-red crescent shaped object that appeared to be hovering over the car in front. The observer stopped her car and the object apparently moved over her car engine of her car then reportedly stopped and the lights and radio stopped working also. During this time, the interior of the car seemed to become very hot, particularly the feet of the observers. The object then appeared to move away and then started to return again. The observer then started her car and left the area of the sighting. Duration of the sighting was about 5 minutes.

WEATHER DATA: At 6:00 p.m. CST, the sky was obscured and visibility was 1/2 mile with light drizzle.

At 7:00 p.m. CST, there was a 3/4 cloud cover with fog from the surface to the base of clouds and visibility of 4 miles.

At 10:00 p.m. CST, it was overcast with fog from the surface to the base of the clouds and visibility was 5 miles.

COMMENTS: Although the observer indicated that she was traveling NE, the map of the area indicates that the road goes primarily NW. The observer stated in her description that the object was crescent shaped. There was a crescent relatively low in the western sky. The broken cloud cover and fog may have confused the observer into thinking that it was something near rather than far away. This assumption would have led her to conclude that it was rapidly moving, chasing her, and then when she stopped, hovering over her. The fog in the area would have caused a blurring of the outline of the moon and would account for the observer commenting that the object had a cloudy stuff around it that looked like angel hair. Further the observer indicated that there was no moonlight the night of the sighting, but a police officer who interviewed the observer approximately one hour after the sighting mentioned that the moon was quite bright. When the object appeared to be hovering over the observer's automobile, she rolled up the windows and locked the doors, presumably for protection. It seems to be at this point that the observer began to feel hot. However, the observer stated that she had the heater on and going full. This would account for the sensation of heat, particularly on the feet.

The observer was quite upset during the sighting and states in her testimony that "...I started crying a little bit..." It seems quite possible that excitement and fear she may have stalled out the ignition of her car, thus accounting for the engine stopping.

The use of the word "angel-hair" by the observer is quite interesting. There is some evidence from her testimony that she was interested in the subject of UFO's, had read about them, and when she ran into something that confused her, immediately assumed it was a UFO.

Although Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the Air Force consultant on UFO's feels that this sighting is unidentified, as a result of the extensive analysis of Dr. Donald Menzel of the Harvard College Observatory, the sighting is being carried in the Air Force files as being possibly caused by the moon.

UFO Report, 3 April 1968

Dr J Allen Hynek

Reference the attached unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Cochrane, Wisconsin which occurred on 3 April 1968. We feel that all pertinent data has already been gathered for you to evaluate the case. However, if you wish to investigate the sighting, please write us and let us know what additional information you feel can be gathered at this late dates. We would appreciate it if you would place your evaluation on the attached Project Record Card. Also, request your comments as to the possibility of the object being the moon. We would like to hear from you by 15 December on this sighting.

Subj:    Your Memo of November 22 concerning the UFO report from
         Cochrane, Wisconsin, (3 April 1968)

To:      Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Lt. Colonel

I cannot agree that all pertinent data has been gathered. For example, the comments of the preparing officer stated that "the moon was in its quarter phase that night and moonrise was approximately 2000 hours local time". Moonrise on that day was approximately noon (1) and moonset was just about midnight. Therefore, at the time of sighting, approximately 2015, the moon was still 4 hours from setting and fairly high in the sky. It was not yet in first quarter phase. The observer was looking toward the north northeast at initial elevation of approximately 15 degrees. Moonrise is thus no possible explanation for this sighting.

Evaluation of this sighting depends largely, as I see it, on the reliability of the witness. Either she and her son were overexcited to the point of hallucination (but first passed a similar test), or something similar to that reported in many other cases happened. I feel it would be eminently worthwhile to obtain Mrs. Lietha's testimony on tape by telephone, and to send you a transcript, so that we can collectively make some judgment as to her objectivity and reliability.

I fail to understand how the preparing officer could have been so ill-prepared.

in 1968. Please forward a project record card evaluating this
sighting to us before 1970 since we do not wish to look at it in
passing another year.

3. Reference our letters of 22 Nov 68 and 5 Dec 68 requesting a
UFO sighting of 5 Nov 68 near Cochran, Wisconsin. If you have
been unable to gather any additional pertinent data, please notify
us. If you telephone the observer, please send us transcripts.

To:       Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases requested. I regret that some of these cases are being sent to you unduly late. Reorganization of my office and files should prevent this in the future.

2. I regret also, from your standpoint, that all four cases must in my opinion be evaluated as unidentified.

3. I would rate the 12 July 1968, Omaha, Nebraska, case as the weakest in this category and the one at Cochran, Wisconsin, the strongest. I obtained a good tape recording in the Cochran case, and will send you a copy of the transcription as soon as my secretary can accomplish this. I obtained an additional taped phone conversation from the witness. If needed to clear up several points, particularly the matter of the sighting possibly being caused by the launching of a hot air balloon. I will send that transcript also if you should wish it.

TRANSCRIPT OF PHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HYNEK & MRS. LEITHA

H: Hello, is Mrs [blacked out] there?
   Just a minute.

L: Hellow

H: Hellow, Mrs. [blacked out]. This is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.

L: Oh yes.

H: Hi. Do you a minute to talk with me now?

L: Yes

H: Good. I am quite interested in the sighting that you had balk there in April, the third of April I believe it was.

L: Yes, it was.

H: And several questions that I'd like to ask and I'm not sure whether the best thing to do here is to ask those questions or to ask you to sort of take a deep breath and start over again. First of all, are there any questions you want to ask of me, as to why this is being done, or that sort of thing? Or did I explain enough of that in the letter?

L: Well, I kind of know that, but the thing that I wondered about is, Is it really something or isn't it? You know, because so many people look at you - like the other day there was some distant relation of mine I happened to see him on business, and he wanted to see me - and he looked at me just asmuch to say, well gee, what's the matter with you. Maybe I don't want to do business with you. You know. And I was just wondering if there is something or if there isn't or . . .

H: Well, of course this is precisely what we're trying to find out. And you might think that after all this time we would know, but we don't.

because you see, people are reluctant to talk, and there are no good photographs, or very, very few, and it's a very tricky subject, and the only way we'll get anyplace is by talking to as many people who have had this experience, and seeing what patterns there are, seeing what things hang together, what things arethe same and what things are different and so forth, and so you really will be helping us if you do this.

Now, there's a few basic points I wanted to check out. You, did you manage to get a compass and did you find out the directions.

L Well, the Highway 35 is where it is and it's Maxkxw northeast a little bit, goes northeast a bit . .

H Well, you see at first the Air Force thought - the Air Force at Wright Field anyway, generally . .

L See, that road is so - at times it's north and at times it's northwest and then its northeast on Hway 35

H Yes. Well, basically you were going north. How fast were you traveling?

L Oh gee. See when I was down, maybe about 3 miles Below_______ and then a car passed me real fast and it was 65 or 66 Ford, it was tan or tannish colored and it looked like a car that my uncle owns and I though maybe he'd given it to her a grandson and he went by me at a terrific speed and when I dimmed my lights right away them, and I could see, I though I could just one person - of course you would probably just take that for granted, you know - and well then he went on a terrific speed down the highway and I was going about, oh I'd say about 55 - 60 at the time when he passed me, and we went up the highway a ways, maybe 2 miles or so, mile and a half, and then all of a sudden Mark said to


- page 35 -

Leitha - 3

Me, "Mom, look at that red thing," and I looked and all of a sudden I saw the red thing and then this car that was in front of me when the red thing came up between the hills and the valley there, it, uh, then car just nothing. The lights went out and there was no lights/or anything anymore.

H: Now these were the lights on which car?

L: On the other car.

H: On the other car - xhuxhxad

L: The headlights and the taillights went out. And I thought, well isn't that a crazy trick to play on me at this time of night, you know. So then I kind of started to pull over to the right hand side of road so in case he would be there, I wouldn't hit him from the back. Well then, when this red thing started, it was above this car in the area, and all of a sudden there was no car there.

H: I can't hear you now, is somebody on the line?

L: Are you there?

H: Hello

L: Yes, are you there?

H: I'm there but I somebody must have picked up the phone again.

L: No, there's no one down now, he's upstairs now.

H: Well, I can hear you reasonably well. Go ahead. Can you hear me?

L: I can hear you very little, but I can hear you.

H: Well, I don't know whether to try this connection again, or not. Maybe I'd better try to get - let's keep on, maybe it'll get better.

L: OK - and I started

H: I'll tell what - why don't I get the operator and have them call you


- page 36 -

back because this is no good. If you'll just hang up I'll get the
operator.

Connection repaired

H I don't know what went wrong, but something did. At any rate, where were
L we? Oh yes, the car in front of you had just stopped and the lights
I out.
L Well, I thought it had stopped because all of a sudden there were no
lights, you know, at about the time this thing came above it, and it was
in the road, you know. Except this other thing, this object was, it
was above the telephone posts, I remember that, above that height.
H And how far ahead was this other car of you, would you say?
L Oh, maybe around 4, 5 6 car lengths, that's all.
H That close. So you must have had to stop pretty fast yourself.
L I did. It stopped and then I stopped; I was slowing down all the time
and so this thing - you know the other car, after it had passed me, had
slowed down to normal speed, and then I pulled over to the side of the
road see, or kind of on the side because I didn't want to hit it.
H But now, did you put your lights out yourself?
L No, I pulled over to the side of the road and I left my lights on so I
could see if anything happened, and then, all of a sudden, my car kept
running, and then I watched this thing as it was up in the air above
this other car; well, then pretty soon I was watching it, I didn't watch
the other car and it may have driven on - or I don't know. See, that's
why I won't say what happened to it, because I don't know. But I know
when I was watching this, it could have driven off, but it didn't turn
on its lights if it did. And then Mark and I looked and it came up


- page 37 -

and it was above out car and we looked up underneath the windshield,
you know, and we had to bend way down in the front seat to look up
under the windshield. And then at that time is when it cut my engine
and this and that on our car.

H   Now, let's go into that in a little more detail, because this is very
    important. What happened first?

L   Well, let's see. It's been so long ago. I'd have to have that letter
    back, you know, and I took that it to Mr. [redacted].

H   Yes, I wonder if I have - well I do have part of your letter here I
    think. It says, [redacted] and I were coming up the highway 35 and 8-[XX]
    to 8:20 or thereabouts by the [redacted] House. Car came along and passed us
    occupied by one person, a tan metallic color," and so forth and so on.
    Is that the letter you mean?

L   Yes. You told me to write every detail I could think of.

H   Yes, well, I'll read that very carefully after a bit, but just go ahead
    and to the best of your recollection, I'll tell you this, well, did you -
    were conscious at all of stopping your car or did the motor go out
    entirely by itself?

L   No, I stopped it.

H   You stopped the car

L   And the car was running.

H   Well, I mean the engine. The engine was still running.

L   Yes, the engine was still running.

H   And then what happened?

L   I was parked over there, I might have had one tail out in the gravel
    or something, you know, and then this red object came, it hovered, it


- page 38 -

came sort of smooth and slow and it passed from up above that other
car in the sky and it came above us and that's when we looked down and
all of a sudden everything got real still and it got real quite because
the car engine stopped, and I think I had the car radio on too, because
I usually do, and it, everything went off, just like that.

H How about the lights? HOw about your car lights?

L Oh gee, there was quite a bit of light at that time so I don't know -
I'd have to look back and remember out of my letter that detail - that's
kind of small.

H Well, it's very important to know if yourlights went out by themselves.

L Well, if they went out, they (you know I'd have to look in my letter)
if they went out and I think they did, it was when that happened, because
everything cut then.

H Well now, tell me about the - if you had some magic way of putting
something up in the sky say that closely resembled what you say, what
more-or-less common thing that you have around would you put up there
that would most closely resemble it in shape would you say?

L Well, you know those rolls that you buy of Bisquick or Pillsbury and
they're in that little tube in your refrigerator case in the store?

H I think I do.

L And you rap that on the side of your counter and then you get out
triangle shaped of dough and then you roll that up and it looks like
a crescent shape, that's what it would look more like.

H I see. Well, I'm not exactly a cook, but I can figure this. Let's
see, are you acquainted with Australian boomerangs?

L Australian?


- page 39 -

Here is the text from the document:

Leitha - 7

H: Well, boomerang, you know what a boomerang looked like?
L: I've never had one

H: Would it look anything like that?
L: It would be like that, similar, except it was more rolled, than to be flat.

H: Now then, you kept calling it a red color. What shade of red?
L: I oil point, and the best color I can say it would be, is an orangish-reddish color and it looked like, sort of like angel hair that you could see through, and yet it had an orange and red, and it was like an Indian sunset or something color.

H: I see. Now did it have sharp edges, or did it get fuzzy toward the edges?
L: When I looked at it, and what I could get from Mark, too, when it was away from us, then it looked like it was all lines, but it wasn't a distinct line like a pencil mark, but it had, it wasn't foggy, kind of. And yet it had a shape.

H: Did the shape change?
L: Well, when it came above us, then we got to see it more clearly, then we looked up directly underneath it, then it had. Before that it didn't, because we could see it an angle.

H: Did it appear to be a solid object, or did it appear to be mostly light?
L: Well, when it came above us, then it was definite, I mean, there was a definite pattern, but it seemed to be more solid, and then toward the edges it was more like that angel hair.

H: Then, did it ever stand still.
L: Uh huh, when it was in the air it did. Of course, it was always in the air, but when it stood right above us and I tried to start the car and


- page 40 -

Leitha - 8

I tried and I tried, and as long as that thing was above us I just couldn't get that car to go. It just didn't even want to - it just nothing. It wouldn't even turn over, just grunt a little bit and that was it. And then when it was above the other car it stood still and it seemed like everything was so still at that time, and then it moved off . .

H: How long did this last? How many seconds?

L: At the time I was shocked, I couldn't believe it, that it wasn't something like that and I didn't know what it was going to do. Oh, maybe a minute seems so long then, you know, maybe it was - at the most maybe four minutes.

H: I'll tell you what. Let me try a little experiment here. When I say go pretend the thing has just stopped over your car and the engine has stopped, and then just, even if we are silent for a while here, just relive that, image it's happening, and you don't have to say anything, and then when w it goes away, say OK.

L: Yes, OK.

H: Alright, Go.

L: About now.

H: It was exactly 61 seconds. So, but when things like this are happening, time seems much longer, so don't worry about that. Alright, then, I wanted to ask if your starter worked when the thing was overhead and the engine wasn't going, did the starter try to turn over or what.

L: At this time I was trying to start it see, and it might a little bit longer, because I asked Mark I just wonder what that thing is doing,


- page 41 -

and he just didn't want to talk and I thought something was wrong with
him so I tried to take care of him too, so it might have been longer
than time and I turned it and it went "urp" and then it wouldn't go any
more, nothing.

H You mean, what I'm trying to get at, you know how things are when your
battery is dead, that is, if you don't have any guess, then the starter
turns over, goes zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

L Yes, that's turning over

H Or otherwise, it doesn't go at all. Which did it do in this case?

L Well, I turned the key and it went up, and that was all. Then it didn't
do anything, it was like a dead battery.

H Well, that's very important to know that. Now, then, when it left, did
it go up or sideways, or what.

L No, it didn't go straight up. It went straight over towards, southwest,
it went sort of, because it went behind us on my side, and it went over
in the field toward a farmhouse there, and it might have risen a little
bit, but from where we were it just went straight.

H And now, I'd like to ask whether at any time it passed in front of
anything, like a tree, so we could judge how close it got to you.
See, what I mean. If I asked you just how close was it, well, it's
sometime very hard to judge distances unless it's very, very close.

L Well, I think that if I went straight up in the air, it would be maybe
as far as a three story apartment building or something like that.
That's how close it was.

H That's how close, huh?

L And then when it came out - it came down that road - , is


- page 42 -

Here is the text from the document:

Leitha - 10

came down there, right in between that farm there, and it came from between the trees and it went between telephone poles, you know, I mean in front of them but it was above them. I was XXXXXXXX and I could see the telephone poles in front of it.

H Incidentally, are there any power lines - high tension lines - near there?

L Are those high tension lines there, Ralph, or are those just telephone lines? He said he thought they were high tension lines.

H The kind of high tension lines I mean are those, you know, you've seen them cross the fields, these high poles with big insulators on them and all that.

L No, they don't have any great big insulators on them, cause we've got one of those out there. Anyway, when I was down the highway, see there's a mill near Cochran and that's maybe about 5 floors high, and I could see this thing against the mill, and that was a mile up the road.

H OK. By the way, is [illegible word] there?

L Yes, he's here.

H After a while, I would like very much to just say Hello to him.

L OK

H I went to also ask something about the brightness of the light. Did it light up the road, or could you read a newspaper by it?

L If I was standing outside I think I could have, directly under it, except it wouldn't have been a light like in the house, it was more of a, like a darkroom light; about like that. It wasn't real light, but you could have if you would have strained.

H I see. In other words, not a brilliant light. Now after it left, you say it went near the farm house. Did it stop there at the farm house or


- page 43 -

Here is the text from the document:

did it go...?

L: No, it went toward that farm house and it was going up the field, you know and it stopped. It just went real smooth and it didn't hesitate and it didn't jerk and it went straight over.

H: How long did it take to disappear?

L: It didn't right away. I finally - then when it left, then the car sort of jerked. It turned over it went ur-ur-ur and then finally it turned over real good and I finally got the car started.

H: That is, you were using the starter?

L: Yes, I was using it. And it went over there above the field, and then as soon as I got the car started, then it started to come back toward me again, like it was teasing me or something, and by that time I had floored the car and I gotten up to Cochran by the mill there and the high way is lighted, so then it just gradually went back again, and I saw it crossing the railroad tracks and then I looked down the railroad tracks toward that field there and it was just going slowly down.

H: You didn't hear any reports from any witnesses, or any other people around there? Of course, people often don't talk about this. This is the trouble.

L: No. There's a lady in Cochran that saw something like this come from that same direction one morning, because I talked to her sister and I mentioned this about my - you know - and she told me her sister had seen something but she won't talk to anybody because she said, people'd figure she was crazy.

H: Yes. This is of course a problem I run into time and again, and it's a rough one. Now, I also want to know - we haven't talked about sizes,

      (8) Sound: None.
      (9) Other pertinent or unusual features: None.

   b. Description of Course of Object:
      (1) What first called the attention of observer to the object?
          An automobile passed observer and after some distance ahead, it appeared to stop and its lights went out. This is when observer saw object above that automobile.

      (2) Angle of elevation and azimuth of object when first observed:
          I estimate from observer's report the elevation to be approximately 15° and azimuth NNW. Then object was overhead at approximately 60 feet.

If you had - why don't you do this right now, even though it looks a little silly, hold your hand straight out in front of you, as far out as you can get it, and your thumb now, straight out (I'm doing it here too). Now if you'd held your thumb up against the light, would your thumbnail have covered it, would your thumb have covered the whole thing?

L: If I held my thumb up against the light, w would my hav

H: Yes, that is, pretend your holding your thumb toward the light and how much of the light would it have covered all of it?

L: Oh, see those two ends went back, you know. It would cover the whole middle part.

H: I see. But your whole hand would have covered it?

L: I just have my thumb up. No, the middle part maybe. You'd still see the edges.

H: Uh huh. Let me put it this way. As you were looking through the wind-shield at first - you never got out of the car did you?

L: No, I was too scared. My feet and hands were hot. Everything in the car got real hot.

H: Now this is something new that you hadn't told me before. Tell me about yxxxkxxgxxx that now. Did you, I'll shut up now and you go ahead and tell me.

H: Well, Mark was - you know, Mark saw it first and he was looking at it and I asked him what that is, and he said he didn't know and then he wouldn't talk any more. He just sat there and looked. And then, if I remember I started crying a little bit, you know, I said Don't be scared. Lock all the doors. And we didn't get out because everything got hot. It seemed like the inside of the car got hot, the bottoms of our feet


- page 46 -

and our hands started to burn and I could hardly hold onto the wheel
and it seemed like everything in the car got real hot like you were
put in an oven, you know. And it was real stuffy, real hot in there,
and that's about all I know of that.

Now, when you said you had to look down under the windshield sort of
Yes, I had to put my head up toward the dash and look up in order to
Yes, if you'd had a ruler on the windshield, how many inches do you
think the object would have covered, if you'd had the ruler on the
windshield?

If I'd had the ruler on the windshield?

Yes, how many inches then would the object have measured?

When it was away from us or on top . .

No, when it was quite close.

When it was on top of up it was bigger than the road, from side to side.

I see. That's important to know.

Yes, I think the highway if 18 feet wide there, cause I looked after I

Now when you looked, when it was over you then, could you
see anything at all when you looked out the side of the windows, the
side of the car?

You mean, the bushes and things?

No, I mean could you see any part of the object. Was the object big
enough to spill over the sides.

Oh yes. Yes it was.

So - well, if you want to take a guess, and of course this would just be
a guess - but assuming it was this close, how many feet across its
largest part would you say it was? Compare it let's say to a car or


- page 47 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Leitha - 14

a house or a pumpkin or whatever you want to compare it to.

L Oh boy, see there were three sort of like points, but they weren't points you know, like that crescent-shaped roll, you know, and from the two back ones, oh it was maybe - cause see it went over the sides of road too because when you looked out to seeit and I looked the side windows too, it was maybe about as wide as the road and maybe 3 or 4 feet on each side.

H Now did you, you could just probably fit it into a good size living room?

L No, it would be much bigger than that.

H Much bigger than that.

L It was maybe as big as an F89, I think. Isn't that - a jet like that. That's about the nearest thing. I was in one of those in Panama one time. That's why I am kind of remeber that size, you know.

H Ok, now you certainly gave me some additional information in that heat because I can tell you now that this is a thing that other people have reported also, you see. Now, did you ever find out who owned the other car?

L No, because I - right away I called the traffic officer that lives in town and I thought it was maybe my cousin with his grandmother's car and I really called her first to find out if [redacted] had her car that night and she said No. So then I didn't say anything to her, and so then I called and I reported it to [redacted] because I thought that sure was a fool trick to do to somebody you know, in case he had done something like this, and then he asked me what happened, and I told him. So then he said, Well you better call - no he said, I'll have [redacted] call you and he said, I'm coming down to get - then he had [redacted]


- page 48 -

Here is the text from the document:

Leitha - 15

call me, then he said I had to write down every detail I could possibly remember and that he and _______ would come over and pick it up and that he did that night, I think.

H: Now, who was this again?

L: The traffic officer. He's county Traffic Officer.

H: Well, he did the right thing. This is fine. That's how it got then to the Air Force.

Lq: And then ______ called me that night and then some other man called me from Indianapolis and he told me not to tell anybody anything until I talked to him first and he never called me back and I can't even remember his name or anything, and then a different man called me from Chanute - that was a day or two later, and that one ______ could verify, I guess, if I remember right - because he knew him, but he said he never heard of this other one, but they told me not to say anything until they talked to me first.

H: Well, that's certainly strange. I don't think that could have been from the Air Force. Now, the information I have here is that you are a school teacher there, is that right?

L: Yes. Not this year though. My mother-in-law was too sick, so I took off a year.

H: How long - what grade do you teach there? Or grades?

L: I taught Grades 1 through 8 and then I had first grade.

H: Uh huh. Kept you busy, didn't they?

L: Oh yes.

H: Well, now is ______ within hearing distance. I want

L: Oh, he's right here.


- page 49 -

Leitha - 16

H: Can you - maybe I'd better ask him what he said, hnd how he - and then I'd like to ask you a few more questions before we sign off, so if I could talk to[redacted] it would be fine.

M: Hello.

H: Hello, [redacted] how are you?

M: Fine.

H: This, of course, has been some time now since all this happened, but you probably still remember it pretty well, don't You?

M: Yes.

H: What did you think about while the whole thing was happening?

M: I was just scared.

H: Did you say anything, or were you just too scared to talk, or what?

M: I was just too scared to talk. I just watched it, it jest stayed up there.

H: Did you think that it was going to harm you?

M: Sort of.

H: Now, let me see. From the standpoint of color, what color did you think it was?

H: Reddish-orange.

H: Reddish-orange also. So you heard your mother talking. Is there anything you'd like to add, or anything that you think could be corrected a little bit. Let me ask you this, did it get hot in the car?

M: Yes, it did.

H: What I really should have asked you, I know it got hot, what I should have asked is how hot. You've been in very hot rooms at school or someplace, how hot - just how hot did it get?

51


- page 50 -

Here is the text from the document:

Leitha - 17

M: Oh, I gues hotter than our school room, I guess 70 or so, 80.

H: Like, something like a hot summer day?

M: Yes, real hot.

H: Was it hot enough though, did it hurt at any time?

M: Yes, my hands and stuff, my feet. They just got like, burning up.

H: How about your eyes?

M: They burned a little bit.

H: Alright, well I'll go back to the first thing I asked you, is there anything that you would like to add - well, let me ask you this way. What of the whole thing - the whole thing happening - what impressed you the most? What do you remember most easily?

M: When we stopped the car it got hot, it just stayed up there.

H: Uh huh. What did you think it was, when you first say it?

M: At first I thought it was a helicopter, but after that I've saw helicopters and airplanes; so then, and then, all the stuff in the papers of people seeing flying saucers and then I thought it was that and I just sat and watched it, cause I wasn't sure.

H: By the way, I should have asked your mother and I'll ask you. What was the weather like that night?

M: Where we came from all the clouds were you could see the moon, but it

H: What direction was the moon from you?

M: Well, it wasn't.

H: Was the moon in front of you or back of you or what?

M: I remember it was behind us or on the side of us.

H: Well, that's where it should have been because the moon was at first


- page 51 -

quarter that night - I looked it up - and it would have been in back of
you, so that's - I was trying to catch you on that one, a little
bit. But now, let me see. Somebody said it was foggy that night. Is
that right?

M Not too, not too much. At that time of the year it isn't too much.

H Let me see. Could you see the stars?

M No, one or two by the moon.

H OK. Alright, then, can I talk to your mother again?

M OK

H Thanks very much Mark.

L Hellow

H Yes, well, enjoyed talking to . He apparently got quite scared.

L Yes. He didn't say much; in fact when I got home I tried to help me
have him help me piece the story together and he couldn't - he just didn't
want to talk about anything. He just seemed to huddle up in his bed and
that was about it. He was ten at the time.

H Well, what do you think of this whole experience now, now that a year or
so has gone by.

L Well, I'll tell you once I got in my house I stayed there and
I wouldn't even go outside for a long time at night.

H Uh huh. Now, what sort of treatment have you had from people that you
have talked to about it. Do they ? How about at school?

L Well, my kids of course, are real interested, but I didn't say anything
when they told me not to at first, and then after that they were real
interested, and after I had had this experience, then came out
this Weekly Reader with a UFO in it. They were really interested then.


- page 52 -

And some of the school teachers were , other ones looked at me like I was a crack, and my husband said he wished it had been him instead of me, and I wished it would have been too.

H Well, I wish it would have been me, because I have never seen anything like that; I would like to.

L I'd never want to see one again.

H You don't, huh?

L No Sir. Not after that, because I thought it had control of me, and when it came above us - you know if you stay in a house at light and everything is still, there's still the noises of living, you know, but when this thing was there, there wasn't even the noise of living. It was nothing. It was an eerie mute quiet.

H I see.

L And then something else I was thinking about. When it got hot it was so hot that you're feet and your hands, it was when like when you touch dry ice. That's the kind of hot it was. Real hot like that, but it seemed like it was in an oven, and yet it was just that hot. It was just instant hot.

H So I' suppose you'd call it a sort of a dry heat.

L Yes, and at the same time it was stuffy. Kind of choked in your breathing.

H Well, is there anything more that you could tell me. For instance, how did you feel the next day. Both physically and mentally? I don't mean that it affected you mentally, I mean how did you think about it?

L Well, every time I went outside I was looking up. And I guess maybe inside I felt a kind of jittery and outside I didn't shake or anything, but I was still uneasy and I kept looking up and for a while - now it's almost a year later - but for a while, I thought, Gee, if they have


- page 53 -

that much control they could come and just stop me cold anyplace. You
know, it's like kind of always wanted to be around people. I didn't
want to be alone.

H: Yes, you had a - your car was a fairly recent car, wasn't it?

L: Yes, it was a 66 Pontiac Catalina.

H: I just looked it up here. Your report said it was a '66 Pontiac.

L: It was in tip-top condition, otherwise he wouldn't have let me take
it to LaGrosse.

H: Well, Gee, I certainly do thank you for this information. It has to
go down in the books now as a completely unidentified - because I don't
know what it was.

L: I don't either.

H: And I wish I did. But it fits a pattern, a very definite pattern we've
been having from not only this country, but other countries, and
sometime I hope we find out what it is.

L: I do too.

H: Now if anything else happens up in your part of - where is Cochrane
by the way? How close to Oshkosh or something?

L: This is on the Mississippi River, 65 miles north of La Crosse, we are.
But you know, one day - it was in Spring and I was coming home from
school, this was way down by the Archery Club, maybe about a mile and
a half or two or three out of Winona, and you know, the sun setting
you know - and all of a sudden everything in the road lit up in front of
me, and I didn't think anything of it. I thought, you know, this is a real
pretty sunset, you know, and I looked over to the west, there was no
sunset. And that night in the paper - and I can't remember the day or


- page 54 -

Leitha - 21

anything - that night in the paper and there were people talking about it, then other people in Winona had spotted this flying object too, and they said it had come from across Wisconsin over the river you know,

That sounds very much to me like a very bright, what we call in astronomy a fireball.

Oh

And it probably lasted only a few seconds. That's not a UFO; that we know about.

Oh, and then there's - I think it was herd, Mrs. [redacted], she's from Elmer, she's a school teacher and she did at that time drive down to Fountain City every day which is about 20 miles from where home is, oh, maybe about 5 or 6 miles above where I saw this thing quite a few mornings she saw a flying object come from in the valleys there and hills, and it came down - and this is early in the morning. She always went to school real early, had to be there I'd say about 7 o'clock, quarter to 7.

Do you think you could get her to write me a description of this?

I don't know her that well, but I know other people were talking about it and that she was talking that she had seen it, you know, and I don't whether she would or not, because I haven't talked to her about it, but I know other people told me - this was before I had even, or no, it was right after I had seen mine - then I said something, and they told me, well, she those kind of things.

Well, if you can get me any more information on that, I'd appreciate it.

Now, I think I've taken enough of your time. You've been very kind and all this, and if I - I would like to think that something will come of

Mrs. [redacted]
Route 1
Cochran, Wis. 54622

Dear Mrs. Lietzke:

In my capacity as scientific consultant to the U. S. Air Force on the matter of unidentified flying objects I have had occasion to examine in some detail your report of a sighting of a UFO near Cochran on April 3, 1968. My particular assignment is to see whether anything of scientific value can be gleaned from various UFO reports. Your sighting fits a definite pattern and hence is of definite possible scientific interest.

Although your report was quite detailed, there are still a few items I would like to have cleared up such as the exact direction you were moving, the condition of the sky, and the matter of whether the moon was or was not visible. Even more important, I would just like to talk with you to get what you may think of the whole incident, now that nearly a year has passed. I am also interested in knowing how your account of the sighting was treated by your friends and acquaintances. Sometimes it happens that a person is embarrassed, personally inconvenience by reporting a sighting such as this.

I would like to place a call to you some evening during the week of February 24, preferably Wednesday the 25th, or Thursday the 27th. Would either of these evenings be convenient for you? I am enclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply.

I wish to assure you that no publicity or inconvenience will result from your talking with me since I have made it a practice over many years not to disclose the name of a person who makes a sighting without their specific permission. I hope, therefore, that you will cooperate with me in the interests of science and that perhaps your sighting will contribute to the eventual solution of this perplexing problem.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

UFO Observation of 3 Apr 68

Dr. Donald H. Menzel
Harvard College Observatory
60 Garden Street
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

1. Reference the attached UFO sighting from near Cochrane, Wisconsin. Dr. Hynek feels that this sighting should be carried as unidentified. We would like to have your view on this sighting before we reach a final decision as to the stimulus. Our analyst feels that the stimulus was possibly the moon. The observer was driving IM (see map page 63) and the moon was almost due east at about 39° elevation, yet the observer indicated in her AF Form 117 (page 23 c(2)) that there was no moonlight. The Buffalo County traffic officer, who interviewed the observer shortly after the sighting, stated that the moon was quite bright. Yet it seems unlikely that the moon would appear orange-red when at such a high angular elevation.

I have been out of the country and, on my return, found myself swamped with so many things that I couldn't really give the report the attention it deserves until now. However, I have read and re-read the report and have some fairly definite ideas, some of which were not mentioned in any of the report, correspondence. Some of the questions I would like to have had answers to were not asked and probably no answers will ever be obtained.

Considerable emphasis is placed at the very beginning on the car passing Mrs. [redacted] at high speed and, apparently, disappearing into the distance. Yet she seems to think it was just ahead. In my opinion her impression of its putting out lights was caused when the car went over a distant rise. It was going at high speed and nothing in her original report indicates that it ever slowed down. The fact that she slowed down because she was afraid she might run into it is perhaps just her own illusion. She does not wear glasses, but I should really like to know what her true correction is.

It is perfectly clear that she did not know what direction she was traveling in. She said northeast, but the map clearly indicates

that the road goes northwest. There may be, of course, some
turns that do not show in the map.

Her description of it as a "boomerang" or "crescent"
is revealing in itself. There was a crescent moon relatively low
in the western sky. There was also some haze. And she could
easily have become confused into thinking that it was something
near rather than something far in the sky. And this assumption
would have led her to conclude that it was rapidly moving, chasing
her, and then when she stopped, hovering over her. I think her use
of the word "angel-hair" again and again is revealing, though no one
seems to have previously pointed out that this is a word closely
associated with flying saucers. There is evidence from some of her
testimony that she was interested in the subject of UFO's, had read
a lot about them, and when she ran into something that confused her,
immediately assumed that it was a UFO. There is no way of checking,
but when she stopped the car and took her foot off of the gas, the car
engine simply died. It had nothing whatever to do with the thing
above her. I think she was so frightened that she killed her own
engine and turned out the lights. Naturally the radio went off as she
turned off the engine. Clearly she was pretty scared and her fright
communicated itself to the susceptible boy. For protection they
locked the doors and presumably rolled up the windows. It was then
that she began to feel hot. After all, she points out that the heater was
on and going full. And hence the sensation of heat that she experienced
was greatly over exaggerated. There may, of course, have been a
heater or even engine malfunction so that the floorboard of the car felt
somewhat hotter than usual.

I don't believe her when she says that she kept cool.
The record shows quite the reverse. And her description of additional
sensations are not dissimilar to those experienced by people who are
so frightened that they have what is sometimes referred to as a "sinking
feeling in their guts." He says, "I estimate from the observer's report the
elevation to be approximately 15 degrees in azimuth NNE. If the
observer was going northwest rather than northeast, as her original
report indicated, then the moon could well have been west. The estimated
altitude of 15 degrees is not inconsistent with the elevation of the moon,
39 degrees. The moon was two days out of first quarter and very near
maximum part of the declination. The horns of the crescent, therefore,

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(6) Thunderstorms in area: No official report but I was told there were none at that time.

(7) Vertical temperature gradient: Not available.

h. Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, that might account for the sighting:
Only a quarter moon and fog in area.

i. Interception or identification action taken: None.

j. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of air traffic or balloon released in the area that might possibly account for the sighting: None.

COMMENTS: I received notification of this report on 30 April 1969. I talked with Mrs. _______ by telephone on 13 May 1969. She repeated practically every detail exactly as written in her letter. She is a former member of the Air Force and is now a teacher of the elementary grades. She seemed to be a rational person, an observation supported by _______ a Buffalo County traffic officer. We was called by Mrs. _______ at approximately 2030 hours (22:30), 1 April 1).

I telephoned him on 15 May and his account of Mrs. ______'s sighting was essentially the same. She told him in first thought the object was an airplane and then a helicopter because it was stationary. At first he thought nothing of the report, but about an hour later he drove to her house to talk personally with her. Her story was still the same.

_______ said that there had been a heavy rain prior to the report and that a heavy fog was prevalent. The moon was also quite bright. In addition, he said that between the Mississippi River and Route 35, which is about a mile from the river, there was a swampy area near the sighting position.

I have two possible explanations: (1) That Mrs. Licha saw a reflection of the moon on the base of (2) that she saw the moon dimly visible through the fog layer.

Her report that here seemed to be a haze around the object such as smoke, etc. or angel hair would tie in. The moon was in its quarter phase that night and approximately 200 local time (9:20PM). This possibly would be sufficient for a reflection of the moon onto the base of the fog layer in the form of a boomerang, which was the shape of the object described by Mrs. Licha.

would thus have been tilted upward and to the right, for the moon is seen in the west. She had the horns pointing down, but at least they do point toward the right, so that at least part of the record is clear.

The driver specifically says that the side windows were down but she closed them when she saw the UFO. This would account for the increase in temperature and possibly also contributed to the blurred appearance of the object. How clean were the windows?

Sorry that I cannot do anything more with the sighting, but I shall be interested in hearing your reaction to my analysis. I think there is absolutely no reason to keep this in the unknown category. I think it was, without question, the moon. And I bet two to one that Mrs. [redacted] needs glasses.

With best wishes, I am
Cordially yours,

I do not have an explanation for why the automobile engine stopped and why the lights went out. She insists the ignition key was on all the time. The make is a 1966 Pontiac. Perhaps moisture from the road or in the air shorted the ignition system. There also is the question of why the person in front of [redacted] did not report the same occurrence since, according to her report, the same thing must have happened to him.

Asst. Director, Plans/Operations
Chanute Technical Ing. Center
Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois

Dear Mr. Klotz:

This is in reply to your request in your letter of 17 April, 1968 concerning the sighting of the unidentified flying object in Buffalo County, Wisconsin.

The report was made by a Mrs. [redacted], Cochrane, Wisconsin, 54622, to a Buffalo County traffic officer, H. A.Zeichert, who also lives in Cochrane, Wisconsin. Mr. [redacted] received the report at about 8:20 or 8:25 P.M. on April 3, 1968. Mrs. [redacted] and her son were driving on Highway # 35 at about 8:15 P.M. going North between Fountain City, Wisconsin and Cochrane, Wisconsin at a point in the road known as Czechville, when they sighted the object. Mr. [redacted] then phoned my home and made the report to me, knowing that I was a Major in the USAF (Res.) and acting as Judge Advocate General's Area Representative as well as District Attorney for Buffalo County.

I then phoned Mrs. [redacted] and knowing that she was a school teacher, I requested that she make a written report for me immediately, putting down every detail that she could remember as to sight, sound, and feeling. I received the enclosed written statement from her. I have retained a photostat copy of this and you may, therefore, keep this report. I am sorry it is not in better penmanship but believe you will be able to read it.

The telephone number of Mrs. [redacted], in Cochrane, Wisconsin is [redacted]. The witness, her son, lives with her at that same address and phone number. The Buffalo County Traffic Officer, [redacted] telephone number at Cochrane, Wisconsin is [608-248-2225].

If my office may be of any further help, please call on me.

Very truly yours,
Roger L. Hartman
