THIS OFFICER PREPARING THE REPORT (1) PROBABLY DID OBSERVE THE SAME OBJECT AS THE TIME, COLOR AND APPROXIMATE DIRECTION DO AGREE. ONE MUST EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES IN DIRECTIONS. DULUTH IS NOT LAID OUT ON A TRUE NORTH AND SOUTH AXIS BUT RATHER ON A 010 AND 100 DEGREE LINE - THIS ORIENTATION PRESENTS A PROBLEM TO THE ACTUAL ORIENTATION OF THE ACTUAL PATH OF THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT ENCOUNTERED FIRST WAS SEEN ABOUT AT 75 DEGREES ELEVATION ABOVE THE NORTH HORIZON AND DISAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 60 DEGREES ABOVE THE NORTHERN HORIZON. DIRECTION OF FLIGHT APPEARED TO BE FROM 100 DEGREES TO 310 DEGREES. THE 15 DEGREES OF FLIGHT OBSERVED WAS ABRUPTLY TERMINATED AT 69 DEGREES ABOVE THE NORTHERN HORIZON. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE METEORITE HAD BURNED OUT AT THAT POINT.
