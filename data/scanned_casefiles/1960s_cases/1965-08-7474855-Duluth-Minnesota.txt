POSITION TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE: THE INDIVIDUAL AFTER MAKING A REPORT OF THE SIGHTING OF THE AIR BASE, WENT OVER TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MINN DULUTH BRANCH) OBSERVER AND CHECKED HIS SIGHTING WITH THE ASTRONOMER ON DUTY. THERE HE WAS TOLD THAT THE OBSERVATORY HAD WATCHED ONE EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND SUGGESTED THAT CALTON HAD SEEN A SATELLITE. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY MAKING A CALL TO PROF. [REDACTED]. NONE OF THE SECTOR'S RADAR OBSERVED SUCH AN OBJECT. THE POSITIONS FOR ECHO II AND PEGASUS I DO NOT CORRESPOND TO THIS PARTICULAR SIGHTING, SO IT IS ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MANY SATELLITES OR SPACE JUNK THAT IS ORBITING THE EARTH.

12. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE

13. MISC. COMMENTS: IT WAS NOTED IN THE DULUTH TRIBUNE CARRIED AN ARTICLE STATING THAT A [REDACTED], IN DULUTH, HAD OBSERVED THIS SAME OBJECT AT THE SAME TIME. NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO CONTACT THESE INDIVIDUALS AT THIS TIME.

B. THE OBSERVER SOUNDED SOMEWHAT INCOHERENT... SHE SEEMED TO
DESIRE TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE RATHER THAN THE SIGHTING.
THIS OFFICER PREPARING THE REPORT (1) PROBABLY DID OBSERVER THE
SAME OBJECT AS THE TIME, COLOR AND APPROXIMATE DIRECTION DO AGREE.
ONE MUST EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE IN DIRECTIONS. DULUTH IS NOT LAID
OUT ON A TRUE NORTH AND SOUTH AXIS BUT RATHER ON A 010 AND 190
DEGREE LINE. THIS ORIENTATION PRESENTS A PROBLEM TO THE ACTUAL
ORIENTATION OF THE ACTUAL PATH OF THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT
(METEORITE) FIRST WAS SEEN ABOUT AT 75 DEGREES ELEVATION ABOVE
THE NORTH HORIZON AND DISAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 60 DEGREES
ABOVE THE NORTHERN HORIZON. DIRECTION OF FLIGHT APPEARED TO BE
FROM 160 DEGREES TO 340 DEGREES. THE 15 DEGREES OF FLIGHT OBSERVED
WAS ABRUPTLY TERMINATED AT 60 DEGREES ABOVE THE NORTHERN HORIZON.
IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE METEORITE HAD BURNED OUT AT THAT POINT.

IDENCE, MR. [REDACTED] FELT THAT THE OBJECT UNDER OBSERVATION WAS TOO
LARGE TO BE A STAR BUT ITS RATE OF MOVEMENT WAS TOO SLOW TO BE
THAT OF A METERIORTIE. THE TWO MILITARY OBSERVERS WERE SENT UP
ON THE ROOF OF THE SECTOR BUILDING AND FAILED TO LOCATE THE OBJECT
SEEN BY MR. [REDACTED]. THE SECTORS RADAR DID NOT SHOW ANY
UNKNOWN OBJECTS NOT ANY AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA DUEING THE PERIOD OF THE
SIGHTING. BASED ON SMALL AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE AVAILABLE THE OBJECT
MAY HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE.
