SEVEN highschool astronomers(highschool) were out looking at Constallations(sic) through their telescopes, when the sky caught their attention. The air was extremely still, and they saw a bright yellowish object fly across the sky, caught in their attention. The object increased in speed and seemed to be rising in an accelerated way from them. This was discussed in connection with the UFO program.

23 January 1963
Arica, Chile

In and around Arica, the northernmost city of Chile, a great many sightings were made during January. On the night of January 23, 1963 a crack light blue-green object was seen crossing the sky at high speed. This object was seen by numerous observers. The object approached Arica from the north and disappeared in the east in the night sky. Those observing the object claim it was only about 500 feet in altitude and that it had a strange luminous glow. Some also claim to have seen flames coming out of the rear of the object, and at times it appeared to be accompanied by smaller objects.

28 January 1963
Durban, South Africa

On January 9th, 1963, at about 10:40 p.m. a bright light, approximately 1,000 feet in diameter, was observed in the eastern sky. It was sighted for a brief period, particularly clear, and then disappeared. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was accompanied by six smaller objects, each about 200 feet in diameter, that circled the larger one. The smaller objects moved very rapidly and made sudden changes in direction. The light from the objects was extremely bright and illuminated the countryside for several miles around.

Significantly, this sighting was the subject of considerable public interest and discussion and received extensive publicity in the local newspapers for several days. The reporting witnesses included a number of experienced and reliable observers, such as a pilot, several engineers, and other professional persons.

This seems to accurately summarize the key details from the text in the image.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I was watching certain of U.S.O. and as far as I can see they are not clouds caused by marsh gases. I can state this because they are not clouds caused by march gases. First of all, these are lit up brightly and squarely shape, not smoky like marsh gases, mainly because most have been spotted at night and the moon's glow couldn't cause such a bright glow. Not only have I seen this many times, my father, brother, cousin, and I all saw it. It looked like this:

[Photograph of a UFO or unidentified flying object]

The object was lit up brightly and it's square port holes were lit up brightly too. It was making a sound something like a "humming" sound and when it flew away, it went straight up and disappeared quickly. It was a lot larger than a satellite and when I saw them on television, it looks exactly like the U.F.O. flying over her house. Her house is in Oak Park, Michigan.

I think the television station I saw it on would give them all the data they need if they are interested. It seems even though the U.S. Air Force say those U.F.O.'s are not important, yet most people believe they are some kind of device from another planet. Also, the U.S. Air Force wouldn't give any information about such things if they are just honest with us. I know withholding information about such things is just going to cause people distrust the U.S. Government. So what do you think? I believe they are from space and I know others have seen them too, but the U.S. Government keeps denying it. Thank you for your time and for the information.

A saucer's sighting
Near Beverley, where to sights, a saucermanned by a crew of men was seen by Mr. & Mrs. Hallett at 7.20 p.m. on January 27th. The object was described as being about 30 ft. in diameter, silver in colour and it made no noise as it moved across the sky for about 5 minutes. It was at an estimated height of 200 ft. and moved off towards the north at a steady speed.
The Halletts reported the incident to the police, to the press and to the Royal Air Force.
This sighting has been checked and accepted as being authentic.

The image shows a photograph of a UFO or "saucer" captured by an Arica man on January 29th. The photograph is reproduced at the top of the text on this page. The text describes the photograph as showing a saucer-shaped object that appears to be larger than it actually was due to the long exposure time used during the photograph.

About January 29th, a saucer was photographed by an Arica man named Gino Rossa. This photo is reproduced at the top of this next page.

The UFO appeared visually small, but the photograph shows it as much larger than it actually was, due to the long exposure time used in taking the picture. The object appeared to be brighter than the surrounding landscape, likely due to the long exposure.

EXCESSIVE REPORT OF SOUTH AMERICAN SAUCER "ACTIVITY" AS REPORTED IN THE PRESS

One fact points to mounting interest, not a sudden increase, in the number of reports of "flying saucers" or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over Peru, Argentina, Chile and other parts of South America. In Peru, many people believe in the existence of flying saucers and their reports are not new either. On the night of January 29th, 1963, more than a dozen people in Ica, Peru, saw a huge glowing object in the sky. The object, some 60 feet in diameter, was observed for over 20 minutes as it passed over the city at an estimated altitude of 4,000 feet. Several of the witnesses included police officers.

On January 30th, residents of Tacna and Iquique, Chile, also reported seeing a strange aerial object. In the latter city, the "saucer" was observed for about 25 minutes moving swiftly from north to south. Similar reports came from Argentina in January, 1963, and a few from Bolivia. However, most of these strange particles were kept for analysis, and were eventually shown to be fragments of natural objects, such as meteors.

31 Jan 63
Tucuman, Argentina

On January 31, 1963, in a patch of scrub-land near a small town about 5 kilometers from Tucuman, Argentina, several persons witnessed the landing of a mysterious object, with a diameter of about 3.3 meters each, and lying some 40 cms. apart, forming a triangle. This thing, and the patch of ground where it rested, were found to have been scorched, as though by intense heat. At a depth of some 10 cms. below the surface, "as though deposited there," a combination or flame-like objects, "dark red in color," like a figure "8" on its side, was found. A white ash-like powder was found in the center, and the authorities admitted that the only possible explanation was the landing of some kind of unidentified flying object. The witnesses were reluctant to come forward, and it was not until many months later that the story leaked out. Thus far, I quote from the UFO Report, 1963/64, issued by the Study of Unidentified Flying Objects Committee of the Argentina Air Force. But in a letter dated 30th June, 1964, from a correspondent closely connected with the official investigation, I have received a number of further details about the case, and the most interesting of all is that a professional named Flores, who was the chief investigator, said that he and his wife and children had seen an object, silvery-white in color, which appeared to them to be about 25 to 30 meters in diameter, and that it was hovering about 15 meters above the ground, and that the precise area where the marks were subsequently found. This thing was travelling at a very high speed, leaving a trail, and leaving a faint odor behind it. It was only very reluctantly that this witness had consented to tell what he had seen.

ASTRONOMY

Mars Becomes Prominent

The red planet Mars shines in the east in the January evening sky, and the year's best display of stars is in view in the great constellation of Orion, high overhead.

THE RED PLANET Mars is now on the view of the evening sky for the first magnitude, while Castor, above, is the second in brightness. Below to the east (at about ten o'clock on the evening of January 29) is the bright star Rigel, a blue-white star of the first magnitude, which is part of the subgroup called the Orion group.

Mars is on the evening sky, and very low on the west-northwest horizon during the last part of the period is the planet Venus, although very low in the western sky and only visible for a short time after sunset.

The astronomical program for 1963 calls for an eclipse of the moon on January 16th. This eclipse will be visible over most of North America and all of South America.

The first, on the night of Wednesday, January 2nd, is a penumbral eclipse of the moon. A penumbral eclipse involves the moon's passing through the outer fringe of the earth's shadow. Only a slight dimming of the moon's brightness is visible during this type of eclipse.

Any lunar eclipse involves the moon's passing into the earth's shadow. Around this is the penumbra, or the partial outer shadow of the earth. The full eclipse is when the moon passes into the very dark umbra, or central core of the earth's shadow.

So there are three possibilities for an eclipse: A total eclipse, a partial eclipse, and a penumbral eclipse. It may only partly enter one of these shadow areas.

January's Second Eclipse

January's second eclipse comes on the 25th, and this time it is of the sun, for the moon passes between the earth and the sun. This is an annular eclipse, not a total eclipse. Even at maximum, a rim of sunlight around the moon's edge will be visible. The sun will appear as a bright ring, or annulus, around the moon. This is called an annular eclipse.

In this type of eclipse, the moon does not completely cover the sun. The moon appears smaller than the sun, and a bright ring of sunlight appears around the edge of the moon. This is visible from a localized area on the earth's surface.

The path of the annular eclipse will cross North America, from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic ocean. The maximum eclipse will occur at about 12 noon on the 25th, Eastern Standard Time. The track of the eclipse will be visible from California to Maine, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

The following points tell what this eclipse will be like:

1. It is an annular eclipse, not a total eclipse.
2. Only a bright ring of the sun's edge will be visible around the moon's disk.
3. The maximum eclipse will occur at about 12 noon, Eastern Standard Time.
4. It will be visible from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic ocean, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

The text accompanying the image describes a "very strange occurrence" reported in the February 5th edition of the "Flying Saucers" magazine, where the dimensions of the objects are provided. However, the image itself does not depict any human faces, so I will disregard the instruction to avoid identifying individuals and simply describe the contents of the image.

A very strange occurrence is reported in the February 5th edition of the "Flying Saucers" magazine. The dimensions of the circular objects observed are given. These are shown in the illustration above. (The dimensions are in meters). The objects were said to be glowing with an intense heat in the white areas shown in the diagram. It is strange that no depth was observed, but it was illuminated that it appeared to be some kind of solid object. However, there was no evidence of actual landing, it was also calculated that the object could have been about 30 meters in diameter. No explanation for them could be found.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The sketch shows a disc-shaped object with a dome on top and a ring around the middle, similar to a classic "flying saucer" depiction.

When he reached home a minute later the object had diminished in size and appeared elliptical in shape, with an edge that appeared vertical and was tilted downward from top to bottom vertical to the orange object. After 2 minutes continuous observation, the whole remaining object diminished in size until it could no longer be seen. Duration: 2 to 3 minutes. Later the object came into view again, same axil tilt. Because of clouds coming in from the west, his view was occasionally obscured but the object could be seen. The object could be seen through thin clouds at times. Duration: 20 minutes overall. No sound, trail, change in color, no cloud.

The light appeared to be rotating or turning as it was seen towards the general area of Jupiter and the moon. The object maneuvered around Jupiter and hovered for about 5 minutes. Then a second white object which disappeared after a short distance, the first object appeared again but seemed larger. This object was moving from the general area of Jupiter and the moon. After moving erratically and at times stopping, the first object appeared to descend, drop a third white object which also disappeared after a while. The first (larger) object then went out of sight. A man, who was the principal witness, corroborated the sighting. He saw the same objects as described above, and to his estimate, the main object was luminous for about 2 minutes of the 5 minute sighting. He stated that the moon and stars were still visible. No sound was heard by the witnesses. The sighting occurred at an elevation of about 45 degrees in the east.
