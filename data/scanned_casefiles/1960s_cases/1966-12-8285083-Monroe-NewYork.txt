J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:
There are numerous airways and airports in the area.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer: I talked with Mrs. for ten minutes. She could offer no additional information than is reported herein. There is insufficient evidence available to suspect anything unnatural in this observation. My guess would be that it was reflected light from a car or cars on a highway in view of the very strong inversion that was present that night. In any case, there is insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.
