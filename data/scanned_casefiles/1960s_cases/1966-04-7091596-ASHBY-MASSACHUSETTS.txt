ASHBY CIVIL DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
Ashby Fire Station
ASHBY, MASSACHUSETTS

April 27, 1966.

OFFICER IN CHARGE
OF UFO RECORDINGS:
DEAR SIR;

PER INSTRUCTIONS OF STATE C.D. AGENCY, I AM FORWARDING A UFO SIGHTING MADE BY A MR. [REDACTED] A RIDER-PASSENGER IN HIS AUTO ON THE EVENING OF MONDAY, APRIL 25, AT 8:10 P.M.

AS REPORTED TO MYSELF STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS HELICOPTER SHAPED WITH FIRE OR FLAME EMITTING FROM THE TAIL SECTION.

UNDERSIDE APPEARED TO BE OPEN-MOUTHED SHAPE AND OBJECT SWOOPED DOWN TO A LEVEL OF APPROX. 100 FEET OVER AUTO, CAUSING OCCUPANTS TO BECOME NEAR-HYSTERICAL. A BRIGHT BLUISH LIGHT SEEMED TO DOMINATE THE OBJECT, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO SOUND, PERHAPS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE HALFPENNY AUTO WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED OF 40 M.P.H. THUS BLOTTING OUT ANY OTHER SOUNDS.

ASHBY CIVIL DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
Ashby Fire Station
ASHBY, MASSACHUSETTS

Both auto and object were traveling westerly
on Route 31 from Fitchburg to Ashby, and after
the encounter, Mr. [redacted] states that UFO
accelerated at extreme speed and disappeared
over or around Mt. Watatic.

I feel certain that both passengers in said auto
are reliable and conscientious persons.
The passenger in said auto is a school teacher
in the city of Leominster, and he reportedly
related his experience to the Leom. C.D. Dir.
Mr. Phillip Wright, who in turn contacted
yourself.

Direction - East to West.

Yours Truly,
C.D. Dir.
Wheeler Road,
Ashby, Mass.
01431

P.S. Witness states
that object definitely
was not a meteorite that
was sighted by many persons
on same night.
