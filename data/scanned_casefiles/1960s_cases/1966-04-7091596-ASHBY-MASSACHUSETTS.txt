OFFICER IN CHARGE
OF UFO RECORDINGS: 
DEAR SIR:
PER INSTRUCTIONS OF STATE C.D.
AGENCY, I AM FORWARDING A UFO SIGHTING MADE
BY A MR. [REDACTED] OF ASHBY, ALONG WITH
A RIDER-PASSENGER IN HIS AUTO ON THE EVENING
OF MONDAY, APRIL 25, AT 8:10 P.M.
AS REPORTED TO MYSELF, THE OBJECT WAS HELICOPTER SHAPED WITH
FIRE OR FLAME EMITTING FROM THE TAIL SECTION.
UNDER SIDE APPEARED TO BE OPEN-MOUTHED
SHAPE AND OBJECT SWOOPED DOWN TO A LEVEL OF
APPROX 100 FEET ABOVE AUTO, CAUSING OCCUPANTS
TO BECOME HYSTERICAL. A BRIGHT BLUISH
LIGHT SEEMED TO DOMINATE THE OBJECT, ALTHOUGH
THERE WAS NO SOUND, PERHAPS DUE TO THE FACT
THAT THE HALFTRACK AUTO WAS TRAVELING AT
40 M.P.H. THUS BLOTTING OUT ANY OTHER SOUNDS.

Both auto and object were traveling westerly on route 31 from Fitchburg to Ashby, and after the object passed close by, the auto accelerated at extreme rate of speed and disappeared over or around Mt. Watatic.

I feel certain that both passengers in said auto are reliable and conscientious persons. The passenger in said auto is a school teacher in the city of Leominster, and he reportedly related his experience to the Leominster C.D. Dir., Mr. Philip Wright, who in turn contacted you.

DIRECTION - EAST TO WEST.

Yours Truly,
C.D. Dir.
Wheeler Road,
Ashby, MASS. 
01431

P.S. WITNESS STATES THAT OBJECT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A METEORITE THAT WAS SIGHTED BY MANY PERSONS ON SAME NIGHT.
