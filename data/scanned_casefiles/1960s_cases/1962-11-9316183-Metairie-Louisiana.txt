The object appeared to be a small section of sky moving at first. It was not moving. Later
if termed a light red, a red light appeared at the front end and it started to move in a
northeasterly direction, ascending rapidly until it was lost from sight by height and
distance. Others stopped their cars and watched it go off but I don't know what they were

November 2, 1962,

Dear Mr. President,

I don't know if I am doing the right thing in writing this letter to you as it will be screened and probably thrown out before you see it. I did, however, feel it was my duty to inform you of what was seen.

As my husband and I were driving home yesterday evening about 5:15 along Veterans' Highway we noticed a small piece of sky writing about a mile or two ahead. I noticed it first and after waiting a reasonable time for more of the writing to appear I called it to the attention of my husband who was driving the car. As it turned out, it wasn't sky writing at all but some kind of aircraft.

As we approached David Drive, we noticed that the silvery rod and its started turning a pink and then into a light rose as I watched. A red light was at the "front" of the craft. It appeared rapidly and finally was lost to sight because of the great height it attained.

A couple of other cars stopped and looked at it also, even asking others including us if we knew what it was, but we don't know who these people were.


- page 7 -

We called several places when we arrived such as the airport, the newspapers, the F.B.I., and the Special Investigation Department of the Air Force, but no one seemed at all interested in finding out just what the "thing" could be. The newspaper wanted to get names so they could print something, but other than this, we got no action whatsoever.

Now I know you get lots of reports of people seeing "flying saucers," but this was no "saucer" and no mirage. We both saw it and saw the same thing! It was definitely some sort of powered aircraft which could stay suspended in the air or take off at a fast pace at will.

My husband judged it to be about two or three thousand feet when it was still but it climbed rapidly once it started moving.

Now I've reported the thing to you and it is up to Washington to do as it sees fit. I feel better about getting it off my mind.

Yours very truly,
Mrs. [Redacted]
Metairie, Louisiana

As it looked when flying still.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Continued ascending until it could no longer be seen with the naked eye?

Ground

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

About twice the size of the fuselage of a delta 4 engine jet.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

1/6

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Yes, it climbed rapidly disappearing into the sky.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

When I first saw it, it appeared to be the start of some sky writing. After I watched for the plane to look more for a few minutes, I called it to my attention. The both watched it turn toward into turn during the car. The both watched until it were almost unable to see it end. Like when the took off.
