SAFOICC/Hrs Cassel/jad/79079/22 Mar 67
MAR 23 1967

Dear Mr. _____,

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter concerning your observation on December 15, 1966. A basic report describing this sighting as we discussed it during the interview is provided as requested.

The observer, a Mrs. Cassel, lives in Miles City, Montana, and reports that on the evening of December 15, 1966, she observed a star-like object in the sky which changed color and position. Her description, which is consistent with that of an observation of a planet, would indicate that she probably observed the star-like object in the manner described.

The observer states that the object changed color from white to red to blue, and back to white again. This change in color is consistent with the normal apparent changes in color that can occur with the movement of a planet through the atmosphere. The object also reportedly moved about in the sky, which is again consistent with the apparent motion of a planet as the observer changes position.

When sightings occur, and the observer is looking through the atmosphere, the observer is often seeing the various colors of the spectrum broken up and refracted by the atmosphere. This can give the impression of color changes in the object being observed. The light rays of different colors are bent by the atmosphere to different degrees, causing the color separation.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it would appear that Mrs. Cassel probably observed a planet, possibly Venus, rather than an unidentified flying object. We are then looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere, causing the light rays to be broken up and refracted, giving the impression of color changes in the object.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. We appreciate your cooperation in providing this information.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a compass rose and a graphical representation of an object's path and motion.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show the direction (azimuth) from which you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass rose to show the direction (azimuth) from which you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
7  Dec 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.  

We think there is a slight explanation of the object as it passed overhead as a tight flight or a slight rise. It appeared as though it landed or was something that stopped along the bottom of the missile silo about two miles dis tant.

Unfortunately definition must have been obscured perhaps a small plane at a slight distance. The normal appearance as to speed or location appeared different or unusual as to might or in a slight rise.
