SAFOICC/Mrs Cassel/jad/79079/22 Mar 67

MAR 28 1967

Dear Mr [redacted]

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter concerning your observation on December 12, 1966. A heavy backlog of correspondence and reports has precluded our answering all inquiries as promptly as we should like.

An analysis of the information which you submitted revealed that you probably observed the star, Sirius, with description, size, brightness, movements, etc. are consistent with that of an observation of that particular star. Sirius, with a stellar magnitude of approximately -1.5, is the brightest star visible in the heavens.

When stars are viewed low on the horizon, the observer is looking through many miles of the earth's atmosphere; therefore, the earth's atmosphere actually acts as a prism, which in effect causes the incoming rays of light to be broken into the various colors of the spectrum. The technical terms the phenomenon is called refraction. The closer the stars are to the horizon; the more they scintillate, simply as mentioned above, because when looking through the thicker layer of air. The bright star, Sirius, scintillates, and the light rays from this star undergo rather marked refraction.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. We appreciate your interest in our program.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

I have since sighted the same object in the same location several times. I am now thoroughly convinced the object is a bright star or planet.

It did not appear as large or as bright since although at this slight range & roll, alternately
