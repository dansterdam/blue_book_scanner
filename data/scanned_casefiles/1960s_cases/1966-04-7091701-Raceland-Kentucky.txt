Dear Sir,

Just 2 weeks ago, the morning of 17 got it just sitting in the sky. It was standing still, above the tree line, in the sky. I watched it for about 5 minutes, watched it faded out - came back again. I watched to be sure but still not see it again. I then called the fire police at Ashland to see if someone else had seen this. After I talked with the police man-said there had been some - but after checking with another police man-said there had been nothing going on.

I spent other time at the local daily it depends on April 28th of the reports of people seeing something at about 10 at night. Kind 164 mi. in

It was up above the tree line & below some low hanging clouds. As there has never been any light of any kind in that vicinity in the 8 years we have lived here - I got my glasses on and watched it entered it went out. Then I called the State Police at Ashland.
