10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round bright white object size of star moving to SE. No change in intensity, and object lost in brightness of moon. Initial observation at 45 dgr elevation 290 dgr azimuth and disappearance after 15 minutes at 30 dgr elevation 120 dgr azimuth. Straight flight. Appeared to be satellite from flight path.

11. COMMENTS
ECHO was over Duluth at 820 PM at 83 dgr elevation 1 City moving SE. Time error of exactly one hour. Sighting conforms to satellite observation with this exception. Possible error in conversion to Zebra time. Case considered as insufficient data due to this discrepancy.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round object with flat top bigger than moon observed at 70 dgr elevation 140 dgr azimuth from car. Object was glowing and appeared to climb. In sight for two minutes at which time it had moved to 120 dgr azimuth. Color of a brilliant orange.

11. COMMENTS
Considerable jet and conventional a/c traffic in area at time of report. F-106's taking off in Duluth. Probably one of these a/c with afterburner. Duration consistent with this analysis. Description conforms to balloon sighting, however duration more in line with a/c sighting.
