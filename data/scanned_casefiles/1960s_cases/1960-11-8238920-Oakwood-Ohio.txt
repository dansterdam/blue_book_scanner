RECEIVED CALL: 15 November 1960

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: What is your name, sir?

[Redacted text]

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: What is your phone No?

[Redacted text]

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Did I understand you are employed on the Base?

[Redacted text]: No, in the city. We have a [redacted] and I was just out looking at a house yesterday and I know I had this appointment at six, so I know it was quarter after six when I walked out of the house - and I was on [redacted] and I was standing - this would be about 10 or 15 minutes after six - and this thing was

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: 180°, in other words, you were about due south

[Redacted text]: I was about due south and the first time I stood on the sidewalk and I mean this thing it was coming, I would say pretty close to about 320° away from me

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: It was bearing of 320° from your position?

[Redacted text]: It was bearing from about 320° the first time I saw it. It looked like it was going in for about, I would say about 30° or something like that. But anyway, I was on the sidewalk and I mean this and took on a definite shape. It was pointed and triangular - it had like a glow over it - it looked like a glow or the outer edges of it and the kind of it like an arc spatial like maybe a star droplight. It was very, very bright - the whole object. Not to bad a definition shape so it, and then I ran to the street it was going across - and from my perception it looked to me like it would go just about over the big running at Patterson Field.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Would you estimate that it was traveling parallel with the horizon, or?

[Redacted text]: It was pretty low. It was on parallel with the horizon, yes, but it was down low. It wasn't too high.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: And did it have any colors to it?

[Redacted text]: No, it was bright. It was so bright that it almost took on like maybe a bluish cast like.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Could you distinguish a definite shape to it?

[Redacted text]: Yes, it was triangular.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Did it have any outline other than its size?

[Redacted text]: The light by itself was triangular on its and thin glow all around the edge of it. It looked like it was back of an airplane.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Could you make any estimate on size?

[Redacted text]: It was like I say, first I thought it was a shooting star, then I got this second view of it and it definitely had a substantial shape to it. I would say if was roughly fair - with the little caveat it would be pretty hard to estimate - but it was definitely not a star because it was not a partial with thin.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Did you have any sound or any noise?

[Redacted text]: There was no noise, No.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: I'll pass this on the Intelligence people

[Redacted text]: This was something I never seen before and I have been talking about it all day today and I thought maybe somebody else had seen it and maybe they would tell me something about it.

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: They may want to contact you for some more information. They may have more questions.

[Redacted text]: Well can reach me - I'll tell you - I'm here at the store all day so -

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: And you spell your name

[Redacted text]: [Redacted]

CAPTAIN NAYLOR: Well, thanks for calling in [Redacted]
