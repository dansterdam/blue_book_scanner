The object when first sighted appeared like a bright satellite traveling some what faster than any I have seen. In a S.S.W. direction of up. in color with to a star clearly visible and in the same visual position.

Then it seemed to change direction and return almost straight to as I was driving Southern Bubb Rd. I turned west on Terrace Dr. the object seemed to slow with me but continue to come closer & slow down. As it slowed the vapor trails or whatever increased in size until they appeared to cover a city block-220 ft. I turned south on Terrace Bella Dr - the object went out of my vision. I stopped in front of my house-walked to the corner & watched it disappear from sight over the horizon. The appearance at that time was the same as when first sighted.
