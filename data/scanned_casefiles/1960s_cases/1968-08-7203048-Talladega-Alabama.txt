Sept 19
Talladega, Ala.

Dear Sir,

On the night of Aug the 3rd of this year I saw a strange object in the sky. I went about 7 miles where I was able to get it off. They had a lot of trouble seem anything like it before and I wonder if it should be shown it might at some one. So I am writing again whether it may be of any importance it don't know. I did set you the Judge.

First let me say this, I have been looking about U 762 for about a year or more and I don't believe I ever saw anything being sighted like this. I simply was looking about U 762 and saw some time I come out side at night of look at the sky to see if I can see anything myself. I don't say I know what it is, I know little of flying, but what are things for different reasons. But I do believe there are things going across our skies in all directions. I have seen them I think near some flying anything and low or close I read and that has some

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Satellites were put up to orbit from West to East. I have seen some satellites going in other directions. I have seen things that seemed like them only bigger and moving slower in circling. Floating meteors going from North to South, maybe hand of God that when I was looked toward the Earth. Also in several directions at different times of the scene change & what things moving all over our skies.

On the night of Aug. 3rd I was outside near an aircraft on a plane or if watched it pass out of sight then he was likely to the South of my home, that goes from Northeast NWAT to SE East of Dept. looking up at the stars and city I was looking solid when it saw this other like object slowing at pace directly over head going North in a matter of seconds. I hope to explain to you just how at length. At first side there was the only color or light at first was the shine of the star or satellite. The shine went on & off in short quick flashes. As if it were playing keep-keep-big-big-big. It was a continuous plate was kind of off-thing as if went out of sight. It was too fast for me to see plane. Satellites, it seems, are either here high to see it was that I don't believe it was as height.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Mr. a satellite and Delacroix!

My people that time across the street from the uncle that at home at the time they were directing some friends him in town. They were sitting out side and they saw it there. They told me the night day. They were as amazed as I. They too I repeat it could not have been our airplane.

I would like to know if you know what it was. Be if it is another unknown. If you should see this registry on your lookout reports please do that then. My name.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Yours truly,
Moe

P.S.
Sept. 19 I mailed around and didn't mail this when I first wrote it Aug 30. So am going to make it today like I am, perhaps write through on the later.

There is also a hand-drawn silhouette of what appears to be an airplane or aircraft at the bottom right of the document.
