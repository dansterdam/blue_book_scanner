Dear Sir:

Re: UFO

The following is a complete summary of my experience which I will describe in detail:

On November 26, 1964 (Thanksgiving Day) at approximately 3:15 PM my wife and I saw an object in the sky which in the beginning appeared to be motionless. We were traveling north on Oahu Avenue and it appeared to be about a quarter of a mile ahead and above of us.

The reason why it seemed strange to me was because I have never before seen anything like it. I studied Air Science at the University and also spent six years in the Air Force Reserve, with the limited knowledge I acquired through these avenues, the object in the sky seemed to defy all laws of aerodynamics.

To get a better view I proceeded along the road to a point which was almost directly under the object. I turned the car motor off. It was hovering overhead between 500 to 600 yds. If first appeared to be motionless pointing east (I couldn't tell for sure). Then it slowly turned motionless now moving at a slow rate of speed. It then turned southwest and now seemed to be gaining altitude. It was getting closer to the mountain, at this time it was swinging around gaining more altitude traveling northwestward. It kept traveling in this direction till it slowly disappeared into the overcast. This was when I realized the tremendous size of it. During all this time there was not a sound that could be heard. It was absolutely motionless. The color was dark either black or of very dark shade green.

On this day the islands here were receiving winds that were going from southwest to northwest. At one point as I mentioned the object headed southwest which only means it must have had some power to maneuver. Not like a kite or a balloon. My wife and I had a full minute and a half to look at it.

Enclosed is a rough sketch of what we saw.
