    one about 10 ft from the door and the other
    at the side of the house where it was
    darkest. I looked for running lights, turning
    it was again, but this was more. I could
    tell it was a single body, sometimes during
    the day. I can see jets going over at high
    altitudes and the speed was greater by the
    jets. At certain times it dimmed to half
    or 1/2 life, brighter, at one point it dimmed
    more a little dimmed again, all this
