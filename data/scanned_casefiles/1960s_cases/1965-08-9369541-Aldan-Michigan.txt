MEMO FOR THE RECORD:   19 Aug 65

T/Sgt David T Moody spoke with Major Bingham, Empire AFS, area code 615- 946-5326. He had just returned from investigating cases. They had no radar reports for last night. The Police Department had received three telephone calls from civilians who had observed unidentified flying objects. Police Department asked the Air Force to investigate. Objects were observed last night, 18 Aug 65. One man could not be located as he was a transient. One person saw what Major Bingham believed to be a satellite. Other person took a photograph of an unidentified object. He is sending T/Sgt out this afternoon to pick up the negatives. Major Bingham said that basically it was a bunch of lights over the base.

Major Bingham is going to call Mrs Hunt, SAFOI this afternoon, 19 Aug 65.

Gave the above information to Mrs Hunt SAFOI at 1530 hours, 19 Aug

At 1500 hours Captain Parker from Empire AFS called. The three descriptions of the objects observed on the night of 18 Aug 65 were similar to a satellite. Time of observation was 1122 and 1125 (2322 and 2325) local. The satellite Echo II was West of Detroit at 1110, 45Â° heading NE. The person who observed the satellite and took a picture had observed the object the night before 1205 at about 60 degrees elev.

Took a picture with Kodachrome daylight film. Captain Parker will send the reports in because of news media interest, with his comments that he thinks it is a satellite.
