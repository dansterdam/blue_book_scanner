Possible (AIRCRAFT) (MULTIPLE LIGHTS)

There are no rotating beaels over the area of the sighting, which could be we sighting of the object.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted unusual lights that were moving east to west. Lights appeared to travel through the Big Dipper and make a direct reversal of its course in several short jerky course changes. On another account the light continued east and made an abrupt turn to the north.

There were pole lights situated on two different revolving tracks. Ilion is located at the NNW point of "Crater Circuit" and about 15 miles north of the ADIZ point of "Canal Terrain". Aircraft would be in reference at these points.

11 July, 1966

Dear Sir:

While in Russell Park late Thursday night, my friend and I saw a highly unusual light in the night sky. This is the report of what we saw.

Friday morning, 8 July, 1966 between 00:00 and 00:30
A light was observed form the north end of Russell Park. This light was in the southern portion of the sky moving from East to West when first detected. With binoculars it was determined that the light was a double light in the red-orange range of the spectrum. The light made a very sharp turn to a more northerly course. After the turn, the light commenced to blink. As it started to blink, it appeared to increase in brilliance. The range could not be determined. The position angle appeared to be about 20 to 30 degrees with the horizon as 0 degrees. The light was lost behind clouds at about 00:35.

Friday morning, 8 July, 1966 at 00:45
Cloud cover cleared. A brilliant reddish light was observed from the same position. This light appeared approximately where Venus rises as the evening star. It was traveling in an easterly direction. Through binoculars it was a fairly large luminescent object of undetermined shape. The light appeared to travel through the Big Dipper and make a direct reversal of its course in several short jerky course changes (see drawing #1). The turning radius for the course change was quite short. The object was again moving at high speed. It appeared to be a high altitude. There was no sound. When first sighted it was at position angle of 10 to 20 degrees. See drawing #2.

Friday morning, 8 July, 1966 at 01:00
Strange light observed at same location as 00:45 light. Light again moving in the same direction as 00:45 light. Light again made again made a direct reversal for its course. This time the turn was right handed instead of left. About 1/2 way through the turn, the light faded from view. The light blinked on again, the turn had been completed and moved off the way it had come. Through the binoculars the light appeared to be the same one that was seen at 00:45. The light was lost from sight at 01:10.

Friday morning, 8 July, 1966 at 01:15
Light appeared in same locale as the last two lights. The course was the same as before while coming towards us. This time the light continued through the Big Dipper and continued East for a short time. It then made an abrupt turn to the North. Shortly after the turn the light blinked out. The light was last seen at 01:25. The light was not seen again that night.

21 Sept. 66

Contact with 89th Bw, Westover AFB, Mass. concerning their use of refueling track Camel Clock on 8 July 66.
At 0400Z there was a B52 being refueled on the above track.
The aircraft reached the ARTP at about 0400Z. The ARIP is at 43 02N 75 10W where the aircraft and the tanker begin their rendezvous. The B52 was refueled on a east-west flight path.

Also aircraft were refueled at 0230Z and at 0615Z.

Contact was made with Griffis AFB, New York, ex. 3819 (scheduling) about refueling aircraft on the Air Refueling track Camel Train.
The 416th Bw schedules in the above track however on this night they were not using the track. They did however inform that there were aircraft being refueled on 8 July 66. At 0310Z and 0425Z a B52a entered the track and was refueled by a KC135 at an altitude of 28,000 feet. In both cases the aircraft were flying on a east-west flight plan.
