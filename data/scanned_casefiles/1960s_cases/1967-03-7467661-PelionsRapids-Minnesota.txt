There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of what seems to be a UFO or flying saucer, drawn in a simple, rough style with pencil or charcoal on a white background. The object is depicted as an elongated oval or disc shape with some subtle shading and lines suggesting depth or contour.


- page 4 -

The only text I can see in this image is the number "2" in a small circle in the bottom left corner of the page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of an elongated object, possibly a UFO or aircraft, rendered in a grayscale, sketchy style with varying line weights and shading.


- page 5 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of what seems to be a UFO or flying saucer, rendered in a rough, pencil-like style with shading and contour lines depicting an oval or disc-shaped object with a raised central section.

In the bottom right corner of the document, the following text is visible:

NLE
BOOT COFFEE
MAR 25, 1967
NORMAN, TENN

The rest of the document appears to be a faint sketch or drawing of an object, possibly a UFO, in the center of an otherwise blank white page.


- page 7 -

The text I can read on this document is:

+E+
MAR 23, 67

At the bottom left corner there appears to be a partially visible number/text, but it is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe.

The image appears to be a sketch or drawing with some faint geometric shapes and lines, but the details are very light and difficult to make out clearly.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of what seems to be a UFO or flying saucer, with a vertical line extending from the top and various curved and circular details on the object's surface. The drawing is in black and white and looks like a rough pencil or charcoal sketch.
