Dear Sirs:

I saw an unidentified flying object high in the sky tonight about 8:30. It was a bright red light, which brightened and dimmed but did not actually flash. It moved slowly toward the west-northwest, made no sound, and faded out of sight after about a minute. Area police received eight calls, according to the local TV station. Some people watched it as long as 15 minutes, and one observer described its motion as erratic and thought it might have been a balloon. Stated when I saw it, it moved in one direction, about the same direction as the wind, but was such a bright red light that I don't think it was a balloon. There were conflicting reports on its height, but it appeared quite high to me as well as to my parents, who also saw it. I hope this information will help you in your U.F.O. studies.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
A/c
