Gentlemen:

Last night, on the 13th of this month, at about 12 o'clock, when I was with my children, [redacted] and [redacted], ages 12 and 9 years of age, we noticed, looking out the universe, what we could say that is going to pass close to the pole of the carriage. "I looked and we saw that appeared to be a star traveling very rapidly." "It might be a satellite," I told my children. Since then a long time ago we had heard of it. I told my children that you had probably launched another satellite like Rob - 2, since it looked like it. It seemed to be traveling from northeast to southeast, and we watched it for a period of some 10-15 minutes, from the time we saw it until it disappeared, and it passed almost directly over us.

Today I see in the newspaper that with a Thor rocket, you have launched a folded satellite to be inflated in the atmosphere to a diameter of 40 meters. That is why I am reporting this to you. "We are very proud if we have been among those to have seen it, during the few minutes of its existence, perhaps burning upon re-entering our atmosphere. For at this moment it appears to shine more brightly. I am very happy to send you these observations, in the hope that they may be of some help to you in your research. It may or may not be the satellite spoken of in the newspaper today, but we actually saw what I have described to you..."

Very truly yours,
[signature redacted]

[The rest of the text is partially illegible due to the image quality and some sections being blacked out. The document appears to be in Spanish and seems to be a report about an observation, but I cannot confidently transcribe the full text.]

The bottom of the page has a page number "1" and there is a large black redaction/censorship block in the middle and bottom of the document.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

There is a date stamp that appears to read "29 JUL 66" but parts of it are slightly illegible.

The document appears to be an official air mail envelope or document from Spain, with official markings and stamps.

18 JULY 62

October 5, 1962

Dear Mr [redacted]

Your letter of July 16, 1962 to Cape Canaveral has been referred to this office. I regret the delay, however your letter was directed to several offices before finally reaching the office of primary interest.

Our records indicate that Echo I, which is still in orbit, would have been north of Madrid moving in a southeasterly direction at 17 minutes after midnight on 13 July, 1962. It should have been at an elevation of 82 degrees, which would put it in the line of sight you have indicated with reference to Ursae Majoris.

May we express our appreciation for your interest and promptness in reporting your sighting.

Sincerely,

W. J. LOCKADOO
Lt. Colonel, USAF

The text I can clearly read is:

The rest of the text appears to be partially obscured or illegible. The image shows an envelope or document with black and white diagonal stripes around the border, typical of airmail or official correspondence from that era.
