22. Were the object's size. Hold a match or a man's length in line with it and estimate its size in relation to the match or man's length. If you had performed this experiment, what was the apparent size of the object compared to the match or man's length?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image shows two sketch-like illustrations. The larger one on the left appears to be a landscape with mountains and what looks like an explosion or burst of energy in the sky. The smaller illustration on the right shows a circular diagram with some radiating lines or shapes. There does not appear to be any text or photographs present in this particular page.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the points shown. These are "A" & "B" on the curved line. This shows how high the object was above the horizon (actually, about the height of the house) when you first saw it, and a "B" where it was when you took the first photograph.

In the following sketch, sketch places on a map the location when you first saw it, and a "B" where it was when you took the first photograph. This is to verify whether approaches an example of how to explain the length sketch.
