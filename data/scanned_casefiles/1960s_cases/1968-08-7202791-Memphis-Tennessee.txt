There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document titled "Lausanne Girls Report a UFO" which describes an observation of a strange flying object by students at a school in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Lausanne Girls
Report a UFO
Twenty-five Lausanne
School students, and Mrs.
Don Atlan, head of the
school's History Depart-
ment, said they witnessed
an unusual flying object
around Wimberly, Lau-
sanne, on February 14th.
The students outside the dormitory saw
the strange object between
8:30 and 9. "It was too slow
to be a plane, and it was not
elongated like a blimp. It
had red and green lights on
its underside. The windows
were large, and on the bot-
tom half, white lights were revolving.
It would leave and
then come back." One stu-
dent said, "for a few times
it would go down and then
find its way back up." When it
came over us, I didn't hear
any sound. It's never seen
anything like it before."
Mrs. Allen saw it, too.
She reported it to the Stu-
dent's office.
