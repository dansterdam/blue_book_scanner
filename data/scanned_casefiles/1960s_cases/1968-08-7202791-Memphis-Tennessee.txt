Lausanne Girls
Report a UFO

Twenty-six Lausanne School students, and Mrs. Dan Allen, head of the school's History Department, say they were witnesses last night to an unusual flying object.

Carrie Wimberly, Lausanne junior, said students outside the dormitory saw the strange object between 8:30 and 9. "It was too slow to be a plane, and it was not elongated like a blimp. It had red and green lights on top. Near the top were large windows. On the bottom half, white lights were revolving.

"It was in view about 30 minutes. It would leave and then come back. I saw it four times. It would go down and come back up. When it came over us, I didn't hear any noise. I've never seen anything like it before."

Mrs. Allen, too, They reported it to the Sheriff's office.
