Report of Analysis

AFSC(SCTA Capt Bracke)
Andrews AFB
Wash 25 DC

1. Attached is a copy of the ASD report of analysis of the object recovered near Snohomish, Washington. This object was forwarded to FTD from Paine Field, Washington because it was suspected to be a part of a space vehicle within the earth's atmosphere on 3 September 1962.

2. The ASD report concludes that this object could not be part of a space vehicle and FTD concurs with this conclusion.

REPORT NO: 62-19                    DATE: 25 September 1962
PROJECT NO: 6771                    TYPE EVALUATION:
MANUFACTURER:                       SPEC NO:
SUBMITTED BY: FTD                   ITEM SERIAL NO:

I.   PURPOSE
     To identify the sample and its origin.

II.  FACTUAL DATA
     1. The sample was assigned Physics Laboratory serial number 10023.
     2. The sample was photographed to show its dimensions.
     3. The sample was examined
        a. For radioactivity using a scintillation counter. No radioactivity
           other than normal background was detected.

        b. By emission spectrochemical methods. The composition of the three
           different phases were identical. Emission spectrochemical analysis
           provided these data: Estimated concentrations in weight percent.

           (1)  Silicon         20%     (7)  Calcium        1%
           (2)  Aluminum        10%     (8)  Potassium      0.1%
           (3)  Sodium           4%     (9)  Manganese      0.1%
           (4)  Iron              3%    (10) Nickel         0.05%
           (5)  Magnesium        2%    (11) Chromium        0.04%
           (6)  Titanium         1%

        c. X-Ray Spectrochemical Methods.
           X-ray diffraction patterns were identical for samples taken
           from the core and from the outside layer. The major constituent
           in both cases was crystalline SiO2.

d. Infrared Spectrophotometric Methods.
The infrared spectogram did not show the presence of any organic material. It did confirm the presence of crystalline SiO2.

e. Chemical Methods.
1. A chemical test for carbonates was negative.
2. A sample was heated slowly to 1100°C with no apparent change in weight or dimension. There was some change in color: that is from white to brownish purple.

III. CONCLUSIONS
1. The chemical composition of the sample is that of a bentonite clay. The magnesium has been replaced to some extent by sodium, potassium, and calcium ions.

2. The object could be formed by a sudden application of heat as a lightning bolt or an air arc formed by a broken power line. The material could have flowed into water, been exposed to rain, or in water soaked soil. The sudden cooling would cause the fractures and coloration of the outer shell. There to the 1073 K condition and coloration of the clay layer are exposed when a bentonite clay is melted and cooled rapidly. The object was found in a stream bed or in sand and gravel from a stream bed because stream worn pebbles are embedded in the outer layer.

3. The composition and nature of the object shows beyond doubt that it could not be part of a space vehicle or be from outer space.

The image contains two black and white photographs of what appears to be an object or fragment placed on a flat surface with some kind of support or frame. The photographs are positioned one above the other, and they seem to show the same object from slightly different angles. The images are grainy and have high contrast, typical of older photographic documentation. No text is visible in this image.
