10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Witness observed a bright light, about 60 feet in diameter, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, moving with a slight oscillation of 300 degrees per 12 minute. The light seemed to change color, observed tumbling motion, giving off sparks. The sighting was estimated at 10-15 seconds. No radar contact in local area.
11. COMMENTS
Duration too short for decay. No character of motion or speed consistent with aircraft. Speed would suggest satellite; however, satellite would not give off visual phenomena as observed. Consistent with this analysis.
