RECORDING SEVERAL HIGH SCHOOL BANDS AT VALLEY MILL BAPTIST CHURCH STATES THAT AS HE SLOWED TO AVOID STRIKING THE OBJECT, HE COULD EASILY SEE THE SIGHTS OF THE OBJECT ILLUMINATE THE HIGHWAY. AS HE APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE OBJECT WAS HOVERING, HIS AUTOMOBILE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED, HIS ENGINE DIED, AND THE LIGHTS FROM THE OBJECT WERE ALSO EXTINGUISHED. AS THE RESULT OF THIS NEAR MISS HIS HIGH BEAM LIGHTS AND TAIL LIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY INOPERATIVE. HE ALIGHTED FROM HIS STALLED CAR AND COULD SEE NOTHING. AFTER A PERIOD OF TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES HE WAS ABLE TO RESTART HIS CAR, AFTER REPLACING A FUSE. HE DISCOVERED HIS LOW BEAM LIGHTS WORKING. HE PROCEEDED TO SERVICE STATION AND HAD NEW HEAD AND TAIL LIGHTS INSTALLED. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO MEMPHIS WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. PART XI MR BROOK POSSESSES FIFTEEN REELS OF TAPE WHICH WERE WITH HIM ON THE NIGHT OF THE ALLEGED OBSERVATION. HE STATES THAT THESE TAPES ARE RUINED AS THE APPARENT RESULT OF A MAGNETIC ERASURE. THIS VOID AREA BEING IN THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF EACH REEL AND PROCEEDS INWARD TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE REEL. AS THE TAPE IS PLAYED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE VOID IN THE RECORDING OCCURS AT THE SAME RELATIVE SPOT AS THE TAPE IS UNWOUND. THESE TAPES ARE AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER INSPECTION. GP-3.
