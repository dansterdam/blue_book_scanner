11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Shape of object was roughly elliptical. About 20' long, 15' wide. Dark gray or black. Object had 25-30 small lights at approx one foot intervals along bottom circumference. Observer was driving along road and almost collided with object which was hovering about 3 or 4 ft above road. Upon disappearance object was directly overhead. Object was visible for less than one minute. He stated that as he slowed to avoid striking the object, he could easily see the sights of the object illuminate the highway. As he approached the spot where the object was hovering, his automobile lights went out, his engine died and the lights from the object also died. As the result of this near miss, his high beam lights and tail lights were completely inoperative. He alighted from his stalled car

and could see nothing. After a period of 10 to 20 minutes he was able to restart his car, after replacing a fuse. He discovered his low beam lights working, then proceeded to a service station and had new head and tail lights installed. He then proceeded to his destination without further trouble.

STATES THAT AS HE SLOWED TO AVOID STRIKING THE OBJECT, HE COULD EASILY SEE THE SIGHTS OF THE OBJECT ILLUMINATE THE HIGHWAY. AS HE APPROACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE OBJECT WAS HOVERING, HIS AUTOMOBILE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED, HIS ENGINE DIED, AND THE LIGHTS FROM THE OBJECT WERE ALSO EXTINGUISHED. AS THE RESULT OF THIS NEAR MISS HIS HIGH BEAM LIGHTS AND TAIL LIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY INOPERATIVE. HE ALIGHTED FROM HIS STALLED CAR AND COULD SEE NOTHING. AFTER A PERIOD OF TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES HE WAS ABLE TO RESTART HIS CAR, AFTER REPLACING A FUSE. HE DISCOVERED HIS LOW BEAM LIGHTS WORKING. HE PRO-

CEEDED TO A SERVICE STATION AND HAD NEW HEAD AND TAIL LIGHTS INSTALL-ED. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO MEMPHIS WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. PART XI MR BROOK POSSESSES FIFTEEN REELS OF TAPE WHICH WERE WITH HIM ON THE NIGHT OF THE ALLEGED OBSERVATION. HE STATES THAT THESE TAPES ARE RUINED AS THE APPARENT RESULT OF A MAGNETIC ERASURE. THIS VOID AREA BEGINS ON THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF EACH REEL AND PROCEEDS INWARD TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE REEL. AS THE TAPE IS PLAYED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE VOID IN THE RECORDING OCCURS AT THE SAME RELATIVE SPOT AS THE TAPE IS UNWOUND. THESE TAPES ARE AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER IN-SPECTION. GP-3.
