Sir:

On the 6th of January 1961 at

was a transmission of this on the
... point this report
hope of it may be of some use
The observation was made after
sun down but during daylight.

I observed a ball of fire(with its)
... transmission at a high rate of
speed from north west to south west
that lasted no more than one or
two seconds in the ball of fire
