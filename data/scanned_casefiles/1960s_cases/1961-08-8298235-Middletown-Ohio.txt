11. COMMENTS
Obj was probably star Capella (Auriga). Motion of obj. indicates star's appearance, duration to sighting, and its position all tend to substantiate conclusion that obj was probably star Capella. Witness indicates that he calculated orbital period of obj to be 23 hrs, 55 min and 42 sec. Length of a sidereal day is 23 hrs, 56 min, 4.09 sec. All evidence indicates obj was a star.

At 01:30 hours August 6, 1961 while searching for the Wilson Cabinet that was visible in the North east, as soon our object that appeared to be something other than a star. I got it in my telescope and its position will of view. I plotted its two three or four marks. I observe them its was moving. I checked the position I first noticed it with a 15° check and again 15°. When it was not visible the Southeast I show it was not a star.

Since the first observation I have continued to view the object moving slow and might I have sighted it perhaps so many...

As a station in my letter to the Public
Inquiry matter office, as we, A.F.R.S., at can
be observed any clear night, at first
visible it appeared to 12:30 A.M. after four
appear at 10:30 P.M. From this I
conclude that it takes 23 hrs. 55 min. and
42 sec. to orbit. I can not remember
sharing of a satellite long put ins orbit
that required this much time to orbit and
be visible to the naked eye. Perhaps I
am trying to determine what it is.

September 7, 1961 I observed the object
itself to move on the scope on within a
mile moving cross hairs. I observed the
planet Jupiter with the same hairs and
found that the object centers roughly 1/2 way
between. From this I figure the object
would travel be about 28 mile long. I
assume at this I figure a 15,000 mph. I
am outside of approx 65,000 ft. in the
atmosphere 10:30 to 10:30 P.M. still flying at 15 deg. 30 deg. approx

at 0:30 hours August 6, 1961 while searching for Williams Comet. I first seen something in the northwest. I saw an object that appeared to be something other than a star. I got it in my telescope and it moved out of view. I picked it up there or few more times and the same thing happened. Then I know it was moving. I checked the position & first seen it, with a compass on protractor and it was at for one hour, again & picked it up and it was moving. I first saw it 150. Since it moved and then the south east & since it was not a star.

Since the first sighting I have continued to watch it. At first very clear night & then it got it, very hazy as. Time not sure of time in the first thirty to days.

Page 10

as I stated in my letter to the Public Information officer at WPAFB, it can be seen any clear night, at first it appeared at 12:30 P.M. after four weeks it has changed so as to appear at 10:30 P.M. From this I conclude that it takes 23 hrs. 55 min. at 42 sec. to orbit. I can not recommend having of a satellite doing put in orbit and that possibly the much time to orbit as I was put in the past. Therefore, I am trying to determine what it is.

September 6, 1961 I observed the object with a house can the telescope, on which I had mounted across their. I observed the planet Jupiter with the same device from that Jupiter would come so much in orbit near to do. I should 26 mile large. to arrive at this, I signed a course of 95 m.p.h. to orbit which would place it at an altitude of approx. 65,000 miles.

Have some of your staff watch for it between 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 P.M. the first clear night ago - they also will see it. at always toward 30 east of Jupiter north and more distant 20 with clear with a 100 power or better. Always they can observe what is sketchd on page 3 of this form.

Gentlemen:

During the past two weeks I have been visually observing an object in orbit around the earth. I first saw it at 00:30 hours on August 6, 1961. Since that time I have seen it some ten times. I have been able to determine that it takes about twenty-four hours to orbit. It travels about fifteen degrees per hour. I see it every clear night. It always comes up about fifteen degrees east or magnetic north and moves toward the southeast. I followed its course Wed. night August 16, for three and one half hours and checked its traveled distance at fifty two and one half degrees, This further proves it's time to orbit as twenty four hours.

I do not remember hearing of a satellite being put in orbit that would take this long to orbit. Also if it takes twenty four hours to orbit and is traveling close to eighteen thousand miles per hour, to stay in orbit, it would be some sixty-five thousand miles above the earth. If it is at this altitude, it must be something very large, because it appears about as bright as a second magnitude star.

I wonder if you have any information as to what it is. If so I hope you will let me know.

Yours Truly,
