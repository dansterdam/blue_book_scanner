The object is difficult to explain and know for sure what it was. It seems likely it was some type of aircraft or craft, possibly with an experimental or unusual design. The brightness and speed suggest advanced technology. It is possible it could be a natural phenomenon, but the maneuverability and details observed point more to an artificial aerial object.

As friend since knows this case. 
as A resident in my mother (?) ex) mother was the experience i remember only very clearly. it was on a cloudy night about 10:30 p.m. The object appear at first to be about 15:30 to 20 min. It startled that it flicks 25 min. and the sound it can not remember whether it made any sound at all. the object seem to disappear back a into sky. a neighbor came the next morning the same time to my home and said he had seen same flying object. I would not identify this object as an aircraft i have ever known.
August 8, 1961 I advised - the closest settlement is a house on the upper on which it is only a mile. I estimated the object height approximately 250 feet based on the barn near it and the height of
the nearest forest trees - about 50 - 60 feet.

At 9:30 p.m. about August 9, 1961, while standing outside in my yard, I observed a light in the northern sky which at first appeared to be a distant airplane. As it came closer, I observed that it was moving quite rapidly, and did not have the characteristics of an aircraft. The light was a steady, brilliant white, and appeared to be in the shape of a disk or oval. There were no wings, tail, or other appendages visible. The light did not blink or flash, and appeared to be self-luminous. It moved in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed, and then made an abrupt change in direction, moving upward at a steep angle and disappearing from sight within a few seconds. I have never before observed anything like this, and was quite startled by the strange behavior and appearance of the object.

- page 15 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

So that in my belief it has shown up a couple of times during the day before and some time after. The first one appeared at 13:30 pm. Later on, we went to the local police station and reported it as they have their own reports of strange objects seen in the sky. It has been changed to 10:30 pm. The color was bright white and remained stationary most of the time and at times it would move very slowly to the east. It would remain visible for about 15-20 minutes. From 22:30 on it had a reddish hue and moved at a faster rate than before. As far as I can remember, this is the extent of the information that I can give you at this time. I hope this helps in some way.

September 6, 1961 is when this object was observed. The possible reason for the sighting was that there were some nearby maneuver or test flights going on at the time. The object in question was unlike any conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. Its movement and behavior were quite strange and not typical of any known aircraft. I would appreciate any feedback you can provide on this report. Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional details.

Office of Public Information
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
August 22, 1961

Gentlemen:

During the past two weeks I have been visually observing an object in the sky. This object appears to be a satellite and has been visible to me all this time. I am able to determine that it takes about twenty-four hours for it to orbit, and that it travels in a southeasterly direction. This course was followed the night of August 15, just as it has on succeeding nights, and each time it disappears from view after about twenty-four hours.

I do not know if you have any information as to hearing of a satellite being put in orbit that would take this long to orbit. Also, if it takes twenty-four hours to orbit, is it possible that this is some satellite that has been around for a while and is at this altitude, it must be something very large, because it appears about as bright as a second magnitude star.

I wonder if you have any information as to what it is. If so I hope you will let me know.

Yours Truly,
[Redacted]
