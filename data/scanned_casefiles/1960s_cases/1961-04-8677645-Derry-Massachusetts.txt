TO : Mr. W. McCurdy (for ATIC)                 DATE: May 12, 1961.

FROM : Alex. B. Geddes (Moonwatch)

SUBJECT:    Unidentified Objects.

Reported (in personal interview, May 11, 1961) by Mr. [redacted], Malden (DA 4-4373).

Date: April 28, 1961 EST (4½ minutes)

Observing Position: 70 15' N     140 42' E     (about 4 miles south of Derry, Mass. in car heading NNW on Route 28)

Object: Very large, glowing with an intense and blinding ice-blue light like an Argon gas flame, and with the following definite shape:

(Mr. [redacted] was asked to compare size with a structure visible from office window where interview was held. It was found that a ruler held at arm's length produced an apparent size of 1 to 1.5 inches long by 0.5 inches wide).

Object travelled practically due east to west at a level altitude of 30° to 35°, from about azimuth 010° to 330°. After travelling parallel with horizon, the object suddenly dropped off at an angle, appeared to grow smaller, and suddenly vanished before reaching horizon.

Color became orange after trajectory dropped. Back-end of object was indefinite and may be described as including a short wide trail about 15% total length of object.
