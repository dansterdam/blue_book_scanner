REPLY TO
ATTN OF:   AFCIN-4X2/Captain McNeill/59117

SUBJECT:   Extract from ATIC Duty Officers Report                   29 January 1960

TO:        AFCIN-4E (Major Friend)

Following is an extract from ATIC Duty Officer, 1/Lt. O. E. Hayes report dtd 23-29 Jan 60 for your information:

2350 - Received UFO conference telephone call from Major Cypert of the Air Force Command Post. Received report from Andrews Airways (operator at RAMEY Tower was Charlie Tarro). Message HAYS 21057 to RAMEY to WER was intercepted on readback. Spotted apparent missile or rocket approximately 1 1/2 miles East of Poppa India Beacon France at 03262 heading East past 100 to 20° from vertical south of my aircraft tracking approximately 300° moving ESE to NNW apparently ascending. Propulsion flame stopped almost overhead.

2407 - Telephoned (using 330-46). Called Maj. Friend. He requested him and 4E be given a copy of message first thing in the morning.

2435 - Returned with messages - Guard said Poppa India Beacon is in Poca, Brazil.

0146 - Another conference call with Major Cypert. He reports that MATS airplane making UFO report was actually above Poiteres, France and according to MAJOR CYPERT's guess probably saw an F100 or F101 climb to altitude after airburner, 2nd sight, message says "have cited 3 ships (one is a/c carrier unconfirm-ed) close together several aircraft are circling. Coordinates are 3133 North 7455W at 023387a. Our Flagrant Navy Duty Officer says ships are our own including WASP Carrier.

ASTRONOMY

Winter Constellations Brilliant
Celestial calendar for 1960 holds many interesting prospects for astronomers, while Venus and Jupiter shine brightly in early morning

By JAMES STOKLEY

IF YOU WANT to see planets in January, you will have to get up early in the morning. At that hour or so before sunrise both Venus and Jupiter are shining brightly, low in the southeastern sky. Venus is now drawing closer to Jupiter, and the pair will make a striking sight on the morning of Jan. 20.

At that time Venus will be less than twice the apparent diameter of the full moon to the north of Jupiter.

In the evening sky, the brilliant constellations of winter are shining, as depicted on the accompanying map. These show the heavens as they appear about ten p.m. (your own kind of standard time) on Jan. 1, an hour earlier at the middle of the month and two hours earlier at the end.

Most conspicuous of these star groups is Orion, high in the south. Look first for the three stars that form the belt of this celestial warrior. Above it is Betelgeuse and below is Rigel, both stars of the first magnitude. A little higher and to the right is the figure of Taurus, the bull, in which the bright star Aldebaran shines.

On the other side of Orion you will see the two dogs Canis Major, the greater, and Canis Minor, the lesser. The large dog is called Procyon. Still higher stand Gemini, the dog-star, the brightest that we can see in the nighttime sky. The smaller dog is higher and farther east, and in it is the star called Procyon. Still higher stand Gemini, the twins, in which there are two bright stars, Castor and Pollux, although the former is of the second astronomical magnitude. And high overhead, in Auriga, the charioteer, Capella, can be seen.

Low in the east, and shown on the map of the northern half of the sky, is Leo, the lion, with another first magnitude star, Regulus. However, because its magnitude is rather low, its light is absorbed by the atmosphere, and seems somewhat fainter than it would be at greater altitude.

This is true also, to an even greater extent, of Deneb, in Cygnus, the swan, just above the northwestern horizon. If you look at it earlier in the evening, before it has descended so low, you will find it considerably brighter.

The moon goes through its phases in January with first quarter on the fifth, at 1:53 p.m., EST. (Subtract one hour for central, two hours for mountain or three hours for Pacific standard time.) Full moon comes at 6:51 p.m., on the 13th; last quarter at 10:01 a.m., on the 21st; and new moon at 1:16 a.m. on the 28th. The moon is nearest to earth (at perigee) on Jan. 26, when it is 221,300 miles away. Its farthest distance, called apogee, comes on Jan. 10, with a distance of 252,900 miles.

The only parts of the world where this will be seen, however, are the extreme northeastern part of the United States and Canada. Persons in North America except for the extreme northeastern part will be able to see the moon entering the earth's shadow, but only along the West Coast will the end be visible. Again this will be followed, on Sept. 20, by a partial eclipse of the sun. This will not be visible along the eastern coast of the United States and Canada, for it will occur after sunrise. From the Midwest the sun will set white it is partly hidden by the moon. In the mountain and Pacific states, persons will be able to see it from beginning to end.

Every 116 days the planet Mercury comes between the sun and earth, to the position called inferior conjunction. Generally, at such a time it is north or south of the line from sun to earth. But about 13 times in a century Mercury comes close enough to this line that, from the earth, it is seen to pass in front of the sun. Such an event is called a transit of Mercury, and one occurs on Nov. 7, beginning at 9:35 a.m., EST, and ending at 2:12 p.m. This will be visible from the United States but not in the naked eye. Through a telescope, properly fitted to observe the brilliant face of the sun, you will be able to see a tiny black dot, slowly moving from the eastern to the western edge of the solar disc.

When the moon passes in front of the sun, we call it an eclipse, but when it passes between us and a star (or, each, another celestial body), we call it an occultation.

planet) the event is termed an occultation.
As it moves around the sky each month, 
the moon often occults stars, but mostly 
they are faint ones, often too faint to 
see without a telescope. Occultation of 
bright stars are rather uncommon. In fact, 
there are only four first-magnitude stars 
which are in the path of the sky through 
which the moon moves. Hence only these 
can ever be occluded.

On Jan. 10, at 4:00 a.m., E.S.T., the 
moon will be in a phase between first quar-
ter and full, and will occult Aldebaran, the 
bright star in Taurus, the bull. Each month 
the path of the moon across the sky is 
nearly the same as the preceding month, so 
this is one of a series of occultations of 
Aldebaran, which began last September, 
and occurs 13 times in 1960. Of these, eight 
will be visible from North America. Ama-
teur astronomers will have an interesting 
time watching them. Several will happen 
in convenient evening hours.

On the 3rd day of January, 1960, at
10 p.m., Clark James of Omaha, Ne-
braska and his wife observed a brilliant
object which streaked across the sky
leaving a very trail behind it, from west
to east, its estimated its height as 10,000
feet, its trajectory was flat, and held.
