Dear Sirs;

Please send me the Air Force news release concerned with the UFO sightings caused by the re-entry of the Russian sputnik.

Also would you please answer this question?
Was the re-entry spread out over 2 to 4 days, or did the whole sputnik enter at the same time? The reason I ask that was because a night after the reported re-entry a Montville Tpg. (Ohio) Fire Chief, he described a cone-shaped object fall from the sky and dislodge before reaching the ground reports resembling assembling.

Although no physical evidence has been found, the report has been proven true, would like to know if you had any thing on the sightings since it does cause quite a problem.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
