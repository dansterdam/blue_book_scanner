11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
ltr: Two lights no definite shape. Spinning and approaching each other. Round. Incredible speed. Too slow for comets (meteor). Clear sky. 80 ft. high, 170 yds away, two ft in diameter. 29 deg azimuth. Elevation not reported. Second observation at 21:30. This object was at 46 deg azimuth 100 ft in air and 20 yds away. This object made noise like helo. Object came from the SW. Diamond shaped with multi colored light from 16ft. Duration reported as 15 minds. Object was solid with lights. Sharply outlined.

COMMENTS: Object observed for 15 minutes and reported as only 20 yds away. Incredible speed. Number of lights not reported. Witnesses were teen-age girls. Probable inaccuracies in reported distances speeds directions altitudes etc. General description indicates a likely misinterpretation of a conventional object such as a A/C towing a banner, or an aircraft at low altitude with multiple lights such as a helo.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object, and a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ____________
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

November 23, 64

Dear Sir,

At exactly 9:04 on Tuesday November 17, 1964 in West Bridgewater Mass, I looked up at the sky to see two very strange lights. They had no definite shape and were spinning round and round at incredible speed. As they spun they came towards each other, but were too slow to be coming. It was a clear sky, there was a three-quarter moon, and the objects were 80 feet into the air, 170 yards away, and were about 2 feet in diameter. From where I stood they were 29 north and the moon was in back of me.

The same night at 9:30, another girl reported having seen a definite shape of some sort of flying object but it was definitely not a plane. It was 1/2 north, 100 feet in the air, and 20 yards away. It made

Here is the OCR text from the document:

a noise similar to that made by the rotary blades of a helicopter. The unidentified object came from a southwest direction.

Looking up at it, the bottom of the craft looked something like this ... with many different colored lights. Many girls saw this and we would like to know if you have reports of any unidentified flying objects being sighted on that day. If I was by any chance connected a shooting star we would like to know about it. Thank you very much. I am writing in the interest of myself and my other biology classmates.
