11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers called duty officer to say that they had been watching a bright star-like object for 20 minutes and they were still watching it. The object was described as being similar to a magnifying glass, on its side.

Comments: A 117 was sent to the observer but was never returned. Information such as how long they watched the object, elevation and azimuth when first and last seen, and how the object disappeared were not supplied. It seems likely that the observer was watching a star/or planet. However until more information is received the case is being carried as insufficient data.
