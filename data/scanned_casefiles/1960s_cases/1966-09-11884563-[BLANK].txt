Lt. William J. Dunn
3306 E. Hedges Ave.
Fresno, Calif. 93703

Attention Commanding Officer

Dear Sir:

On or about December 27, 1949, the Air Force published a report dealing exclusively with Unidentified Flying Objects. The report was officially titled "Unidentified Flying Objects-Project Grudge," Technical Report No. 102-AC-49/15-100. This report was made available to all the press media of the time, and at this time I wish to acquire access to this timely report.

I am now engaged in a quite thorough thesis pertaining to the sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects, and I am in desperate need of a copy of your "Grudge Report." If there is any charge for this report please bill me accordingly.

If it is impossible for me to obtain a copy of this report (I see no reason for this since the report WAS distributed to various news sources), therefore it can not be classified as "TOP SECRET.") I would greatly appreciate it if you could inform me where I could possibly read and evaluate a copy of your "Grudge Report."

Since this letter is of an extremely important nature and time is of the essence for myself, I would appreciate a reply from your office at the earliest possibly time. I know that you are extremely busy and my letter will be processed with millions of other letters, therefore at may take some time for you to answer me. Please, I would appreciate an early answer from your office!

Thank you for your time and trouble.

Respectfully yours,
William J. Dunn

SWS

UFO Investigator's Conference Trip Report

SWGV

1. The following trip report is submitted on the UFO Investigator's Conference conducted at the University of Colorado 12 - 13 June 1967.

a. Dr. E. V. Condon - head of the University of Colorado's UFO Investigative Program - opened with a brief history of UFO's:

(1) The first reported sighting was at Mt. Rainier in 1947; the object sighted was described as being saucer shaped, hence, the present name.

(2) In December of the same year, the DOD delegated all Investigative responsibility to the Air Force since it was felt that if a threat existed, either from outerspace or a foreign government, the Air Force would be best equipped to handle it.

(3) In 1952, the CIA established a panel for review of all sightings to date. Their report was classified, for unknown reasons, but is essentially declassified now and was mostly routine with explanations of the sightings in the large majority of cases.

(4) In 1966, due to much criticism of Air Force handling, i.e., a small part of the populace felt the Air Force was concealing the facts, etc., the University of Colorado received a grant from the DOD to investigate - in conjunction with the Air Force - and determine if there was any valid evidence to support the hypothesis that we are receiving extra terrestrial visitors. (Item of interest: Religious cults/sects have been established that believe Jesus lives on Venus. Some persons claim they have made round trips - on inter-planetary vehicles - to that planet and made direct contact with Him).

b. Dr. R. J. Low followed Dr. Condon and discussed the UFO problem in general:

(1) The University of Colorado first thought a methodology of study on the UFO problem could be established after an initial 90 day analysis period; at the end of 180 days, a valid methodology had not yet been produced. Primarily, this was due to their inability to correlate the sightings with science, i.e., controlled experiments which produce valid data on unconfirmed sightings. (One would think, after 20 years, that one of these supposedly extra-terrestrial visitors would have been captured).


- page 6 -

(2) Dr. Low continued by stating that because of the inconclusive and inadequate facts available, an attorney has been hired to produce a judgment - on those facts available - to determine whether we should continue to investigate and spend large amounts of taxpayer's money or to discontinue the project at the end of the University of Colorado's investigative period in the early spring of 1968.

(3) Dr. Low stated other studies include:

(a) Human perception.

(b) Press coverage. (Is there an inter-connection or correlation between press coverage and the sightings?)

(c) Optical mirage problems. (Refraction/simulation effects).

(d) Instrumentation. (Is present instrumentation and personnel sufficient, i.e., radar, PAA, weather observers, astronomers, etc.).

(e) To what extent do the reports of UFO's reflect the culture of the times.

(f) Radioactive charged gasses emitted from the sun.

(g) The production of valid photographic evidence.

(h) Possible conspiracy. (Yes or no. If not, how do you convince the public?)

c. Dr. F. E. Roach, astronomer, followed Dr. Low with the following statistics:

(1) This graph represents the total sightings, by year, since 1947:

2


- page 7 -

Here is the text from the document:

(2) A breakdown on those sightings follows:

Between 1947 and 1965, the mean unidentified sightings represents 6.4% of the total, however, nearly 20% were unidentified because of "other" and "insufficient data."

(3) A breakdown of those identified between 1953 and 1964 follows:

Those which are astronomical were not reported by qualified astronomers.
The astronomical sightings breakdown thusly:

Meteors - - - - - - 1,295
Stars, planets - - 805
Other - - - - - - 67
Total - - - - - - 2,167

The miscellaneous sightings include missiles, hoaxes, flares, fireworks, mirages, searchlights, chaff, birds, satellite decay, radar analysis, reflections, clouds, and contrails, etc.

d. Dr. M. M. Wertheimer, psychologist, next presented problems of human perception starting with the transmitted energy from the distal event to the proximal stimulus, sensation, perception, cognition and hence to the report to someone, i.e., police, Air Force, etc., and eventually to the University or Colorado. He discussed the following per-

(1) Dust on the cornea of the eye.

(2) Pressure, either external by the fingers or by electrical means, can cause unusual visual images.

3


- page 8 -

Here is the text from the document:

(3) After-images from staring at a light source.
(4) Auto kinetics.
(5) Apparent size of image or after-image. (This varies with distance, that is to say, the various sizes can appear the same size with varying distances.)
(6) Distortions and illusions.
(7) Gamma movement. (A light the size of a searchlight does not go out or disappear all at once when turned off, but rather seems to fade away.)
(8) Personnel error in estimation of celestial angles. (This is consistently wrong when near zero degrees or ninety degrees.)
(9) Persons who read about UFO's are more likely to report a UFO.
(10) Non-scientific personalities are more likely to report UFO's.
(11) All "personal recollection" very unreliable.
(12) Photos. (Hoaxes and defects in developing, i.e., reflection of light source.)

e. Drs. D. R. Saunders and J. H. Rush followed with examples of some of the instantiation required for the conducting of UFO investigations. They compared gaseous light sources to incandescent or tungsten light sources with interpretations of their various spectra. Their presentation included the various types of films available and their usage, and the various angles from which photographs should be made - if we ever have the opportunity to witnessthis phenomena. Dr. Saunders also covered routine investigative techniques including the witness interview, compilation of data, analysis, and validity of the sightings, etc. (This technique is the same as that used in aircraft accident investigations.)

2. And last, but not least, we were instructed to keep "open minds" at all times during our investigations. Since we are now in a period in which space travel lies just ahead, it is within the realm of possibility that others (extra-terrestrial in nature) may also have the same capability. (Did I tell you about the individual who came into the Safety Office last week and wanted to know whom he could contact to obtain information on how to build a flying saucer?)

Dear Mr. Hennessey:

We have researched our records here at Kirtland and find no information relative to "Project Pounce".

It is my suggestion if you still desire this information, that further inquiries be directed to the Secretary of the Air Force, Attention: SAF-01, Washington D.C.

Sincerely,

The Commander,
Kirtland AFB,

28 DEC 1966

Dear Sir,

Whilst reading through a copy of the 1957 Robertson Panels' report on UFOs, I come across a reference to a method of investigating UFOs proposed by the Kirtland AFB in the early 1950s.

I would greatly appreciate if you would inform me whether you have any data on file at your base regarding the above proposal which went under the code name of "Project Pounce."

Yours sincerely,

[Signature]

JJAH:D-F.
