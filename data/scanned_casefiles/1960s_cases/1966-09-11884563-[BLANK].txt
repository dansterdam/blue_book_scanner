The provided image appears to contain a handwritten letter addressed to the "Attention: Commanding Officer" from someone named William J. Dunn. The letter discusses a report of an unidentified flying object that was made on or about December 27, 1949. It mentions that the report was made available to the press, and that the sender is now engaged in a "quite thorough thesis" concerning the sightings of unidentified objects. The letter expresses the sender's difficulty in obtaining a copy of the previous report and requests assistance in this matter. The letter is signed by William J. Dunn at the end.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Lt. William J. Dunn
3306 E. Red es Ave.,
Fresno, Calif. 93703
Attention: Commanding Officer

Dear Sir:

On or about December 27, 1949, the Air Force made a report dealing exclusively with unidentified flying objects. The report was titled "Project Grudge" and was later released under the name "Project Blue Book". A copy of this report was made available to all the press media in Fresno, Calif. as a result of my request.

I am now engaged in a quite thorough thesis as to the sightings of unidentified objects. As you can well imagine, I find it impossible for me to obtain a copy of the various news sources to which the report was presented. Therefore, it can not be utilized for any possible read and evaluation of the material.

Since the report seems to be of an extremely confidential nature, I would appreciate if you could give me some assistance at this time. If you are extremely busy and my letter will be processed for your attention, I would appreciate for you to answer this in any way possible. Thank you for your time and trouble.

Respectfully,
William J. Dunn

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
SWS
UFO Investigator's Conference Trip Report
SWGV
1. The following trip report is submitted on the UFO Investigatory Conference conducted at the University of Colorado 12 - 13
a. Dr. E. V. Condon - head of the University of Colorado Investigative Program - opened the session with a brief introduction to the UFO's:
(1) The first reported sighting was at Mt. Rainier present
(2) In December of the same year, the DOD delegate brought an exhibit - responsibility to the Air Force since it was felt that the Air Force would be best equipped to handle it.
(3) In 1952, the Air Force established a panel for reviewing sightings to date. Their report was classified, for unknown reasons and was mostly handling nations of the sightings in the large majority of the cases.
(4) In 1966, due to much criticism of Air Force hamdling, the Air Force again was concerned and consequently investigated in conjunction with the Air Force - and determined any valid evidence to support the hypothesis that there are terrestrial visitors.
b. Dr. R. J. Low followed Dr. Condon and discussed the following:
(1) The University of Colorado first thought a methodology study on the UFO problem could be established after an initial analysis period, at the end of 180 days. A valid method by which the sightings with science, i.e. controlled experiments which would data on unconfirmed sightings.

- page 6 -

The image contains a scanned page from a UFO report document. There is a graph present in the image, but no other photographs.

(2) Dr. Low continued by stating that because of the elusive and inadequate facts available, an attorney has been retained and he judges - on the basis of available - to determine to what extent should continue to investigate and spend large amounts of tax money or to discontinue the project at the end of the University of Colorado contract for 1966.

(3) Dr. Low stated other studies include:
(a) Human perception.
(b) Press coverage. (Is there an inter-correlation between press coverage and the sightings?)
(c) Optical mirage problems. (Refraction/similiar effects).
(d) Instrumentation. (Is present instrumentation personnel sufficient, i.e., radar, FAA, weather observers, etc.).
(e) To what extent do the reports of UFO's reflect the culture of the times.
(f) Radioactive charged gasses emitted from the earth's surface.
(g) The production of valid photographic evidence.
(h) Possible conspiracy. (Yes or no? If not, what can convince the public?)

C. Dr. F. E. Roach, astronomer, followed Dr. Low with the statistics:
(1) This graph represents the total sightings, by year, 1947:

- page 7 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings and reports.

(2) A breakdown on those sightings follows:

Between 1947 and 1965, the mean unidentified sightings represented 80% of the total, however, nearly 20% were unidentified because of "insufficient data".

(3) A breakdown of those identified between 1953 and 1965:

Those which are astronomical were not reported by qualified astronomers:
Meteors - - - - - 1,295
Stars, planets - - - 805
Other - - - - - - 67
Total - - - - - 2,167

The miscellaneous sightings include missiles, hoaxes, flares, mirages, searchlights, chaff, birds, satellite decay, radar anomalies, reflections, clouds and contrails, etc.

Dr. M. K. Wertheimer, psychologist, next presented problems of human perception relating to the transmitted energy from the event to the proximal stimulus, sensation, perception, cognition, and mechanisms of visual processing. He discussed the following:
(1) Dust on the cornea of the eye.
(2) Pressure, either external by the fingers or internally means, can cause unusual visual images.

- page 8 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with text discussing various topics related to UFO sightings and observations.

(3) After-images from staring at a light source.
(4) Auto kinetics.
(5) Apparent size of image or after-image. (This varies with distance, that is to say, the various sizes can appear the same with varying distances.)
(6) Distortions and illusions.
(7) Gamma movement. (A slight the size of a searchlight may go out or disappear when turned off, but reappear to fade away).
(8) Personnel error in estimation of celestial angles is consistently wrong when near zero degrees or ninety degrees.
(9) Persons who read about UFO's are more likely to
(10) Non-scientific personalities are more likely to
(11) "Paranormal explanation" very unreliable.
(12) Photos. (Hoaxes and defects in developing, i.e. and refraction of light source).
Dr. D. R. Saunders and J. H. Rush followed with examination of the instrumentation required for the conducting of UFO investigations. They compared various light sources with interpretations of their various spectra. The investigation included the analysis of films available and their identification as of natural or artificial phenomena. Dr. Saunders and his associates emphasized the opportunities to witnessing these phenomena. The last two items, analysis, and validity of the sightings, technique of the same was used in aircraft accident investigations.
1. And last, but not least, we were instructed to keep "open minds." Since we are now in the age of space travel, we must realize that what space travel lies just ahead, it is within the realm of possibility. (Did I tell you about the individual who came into office last week and wanted to know how to build a flying saucer?)

Knightsbridge
London, S.W. 3, England

Dear Mr. Hennessey:

We have researched our records here at Kirtland and no information relative to "Project Bounce."

It is my suggestion if you still desire this information that further inquiries be directed to the Secretary Air Force, Attention: SAF-0I, Washington D.C.

Sincerely,

JASPER A. WESTBROOK, Colonel, USAF
Vice Commander

The Commander, 
Kirtland AFB.

Dear Sir,

Whilst reading through a copy of the 1952 "report on unidentified flying objects" I came across a reference to a method of investigating UFOs proposed by the Kirtland AFB in the early 1950's.

I would greatly appreciate if you would inform me whether you have any data on file at your base regarding the above proposal which went under the code name "Project Bounce."

Yours sincerely,

[Signature]

JJAH:D-F.
