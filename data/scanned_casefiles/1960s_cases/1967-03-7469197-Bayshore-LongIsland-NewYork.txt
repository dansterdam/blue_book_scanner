31 MARCH 67

SAFOIC/Mrs Cassel/jad/79079/15 May 67

MAY 16 1967

Dear Mrs.

Reference your recent letter concerning your unusual observation of March 31, 1967.

I want to assure you that the Air Force has never called anyone a "nut" for reporting an honest observation of something quite unusual. When the Air Force decides on a logical explanation, it is other citizens who sometimes ridicule both the Air Force and the individual. For this reason we do not release the names of observers without their permission.

The description of your sighting is very consistent with those reported of hot air balloons. The Air Force has been plagued with reports from all parts of the country of these helium, plastic, dry cleaning bags are used with a circular structure of straws inserted to provide a platform for candles of some type. In flight, the balloon gives off a gentle glow from the candles.

This is, of course, only a possible explanation; however, your description is quite similar to past reports which have seen positively identified as hot air balloons.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, Jr.

Here is the text from the document:

Sunday April 2, 1967
Bayshore, L. I. N.Y.

Gentlemen;

I write to you today with nerves on edge for two reasons. First, I don't relish being called a "nut", and second, I don't relish wasting my time writing this if only to be casually tossed into the garbage can. I decided to write ONLY because it might serve to substantiate someone else's report on seeing the same thing I saw. So here it is.

On Friday, March 31, 1967, I was driving Southeast on a straight road called, North Thompson Drive here in Bayshore. High in the sky almost straight ahead of me was a seemingly bright star except that it was yellowish-orange. I have never seen a star so big or one colored like that before, (and I am one who loves to star-gaze).

I watched it the best I could while still driving but could not determine whether it was moving until I made the turn to my home and stopped my car. It was moving, all right, very steadily and slowly in a straight line coming in what I believe was a Northeasterly direction.

I called to my daughter, aged 11, to run for her binoculars. (very cheap and childish binoculars). They helped me only a little, but I saw through them two colors instead of the orangey color. Distinctly red and white. My eyes were tired from work that day so the object only took on a blurry shape which was like that of an egg sliced lengthwise and viewed from the side.

Both of my daughters, (my youngest is 8 yrs. old), saw very clearly what they said was a dark band around the middle. My youngest said the object reminded her of a hamburger. She meant of course the oval shape being the "bun" and the dark band being the "meat". They both agreed on this dark band and much later I casually took out the newspaper picture of the UFO photographed by two boys in Michigan, (which I had saved), and laid it on the table. They both jumped up very excitedly and said, "Mommy, that's it, that's it!!"

Now I have to tell you of two strange details connected with this "thing" so bear with me as it may be a little difficult to explain on paper.

As I said, the object traveled in a straight line. From where we stood observing it, we were facing directly East. This I know because that is where the sun rises). The object had just passed this point, (where the sun rises), when from the bottom, and I could almost swear the very center of the bottom fell a very small light of some kind. This was white and I mean small in comparison to the large object. It fell straight down for about the count of three and expired or went out.

At this point, the large object began to dim very rapidly and it seemed to ark up and back, (this is hard for me to say for sure, though). The dimming lasted for about the count of ten, then faded completely.

Now comes strange detail number two. The lights had just gone out when seconds later, (maybe three), they came back on again fully bright. This full brightness lasted about two or three seconds more and then began to dim again until it faded out completely, not returning anymore. Again as the object was dimming the second time, it seemed to make the same arking movement as it appeared to do the first time it began to dim.

TIME: From the time I first saw it until the second fading of the lights, a total of about fifteen minutes had elapsed. I guess, not too roughly, from 7:15 P.M. to 7:30 P.M.

I might add, there was no sound that we heard at any time. And, one more thing which my eleven year old said when she saw the picture. There is a rod or something at the tip of the thing, and my daughter said this, too, had a similar rod at the back end on which she saw a red light.

Well, that is all, I've done my duty. My consciounse is clear.

Sincerely,

[Signature is blacked out]
