Dear Sirs,

Some weeks ago I saw what I thought was an unidentified flying object. I first saw it while I was walking by my garage in Lansing, Michigan, watching the object for about five minutes. I knocked on the door of my friend, because I was going this the object disappeared suddenly, even though I was very near. I later came out to didn't believe me, but all of a sudden it reappeared at a slightly different position. I asked my friend to get his CO tower telescope out, while he was going this another one of my friends saw the object. I looked at it through a high powered telescope, and it looked like a fireball. Except that a fireball would have thought it was a fireball, except that it flew in a pattern that a fireball is incapable of flying. That is it flew in a little and then along the horizon. I would like to know what my friend brought his telescope out, but by the time he was out, I could hardly be seen. I would like you to tell me what you think it was, and if you could document any information that you can give me.

Yours Truly,
[Redacted signature]
