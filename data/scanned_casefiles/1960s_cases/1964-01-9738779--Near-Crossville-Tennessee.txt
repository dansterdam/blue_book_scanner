While I was driving to my camp, this tailed came to me and started circling around my car. I watched it for about 10 minutes. It seemed to have a glow all over it, and I saw lights on the side. The size was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. I watched it as long as I could see it. Then it went straight up and disappeared.
