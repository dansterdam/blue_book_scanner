Insufficient data for evaluation

PHOTO: The lack of a definitive signature to the light spot precludes a interpretative type analysis.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers spotted a bright orange to a brilliant white object that was moving in the sky. The object changed colors as though pulsating from some inner power. While the object was being watched, it moved from its stationary position into a new area, turned west, stopped for a few seconds and with a tremendous burst of speed shot over observer's head into the southeast.

Lack of essential data precludes a comprehensive evaluation. The photographic lacks definite signature.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 65-134, submitted by Major
R. Quintanilla, TDSM/UFO for an analysis of the attached negative and two prints. The
following analysis represents a joint effort involving TDDPA (Photo Analysis) and IDDPF
(Photo Processing).

2. ANALYSIS: The setting for the photograph of the alleged UFO was 1810 hours, 21 October
1965, vicinity of New Ulm, Minnesota. The photograph depicts a probable circular shaped
spot of rather intense light surrounded by a conical shaped "halo" against a completely
dense background.

The lack of a definitive signatures to the light spot and the dense background completely
devoid of objects of any kind, precludes an interpretative type analysis. Further, the
determination of which is top/bottom of the object could not be made from the information
and/or prints and negative furnished.

The following comments in reference to the negative/prints and information furnished are
given in support of the aforementioned negative analysis.

a. The one negative furnished is a copy and in all probability, not processed
by Kodak Laboratories. Kodak uses only color internegative film (Type 5270) for transparency reproductions. Further, the source letter indicates the original photograph was
shot with Ektachrome film whereas the reproduced negative furnished shows Kodacolor film.

b. The reproduced negative does not show a frame marking around the
photograph area. It is extremely unlikely that a camera exposed negative will fail
to show a frame marking.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-59, DATED 29 DECEMBER 1965

c. Constant density of background surrounding the alleged UFO is questionable. Some contrast is normally gotten over a shot of a darkened sky.

In view of the foregoing, an analysis of the original negative might prove beneficial, even if only to clarify the above comments.

Information Officer
Dear Sir:

Enclosed please find a negative of a UFO that I took a picture of on October 21, 1965. Also, my report as to the circumstances.

On October 21, 1965, my wife and I, Mrs. Swanson, and Mr. & Mrs. [Blacked Out] of Gaylord, Minnesota, were returning from a hunting trip from the Minnesota River Bottom, near New Ulm, Minnesota. Two miles west, and two miles north of St. George, Minnesota, we spotted a large bright orange object hanging in the sky. We were driving north. The object was hovering about two thousand feet in the sky at about a quarter mile to our left.

The light or the object changed from bright orange to a brilliant white and back to orange as though pulsating from some inner power. The time was just 5:10 p.m.

We watched this object for all of five minutes while it was hovering. We took back into the car and drove closer and area more got out to watch.

I took my camera and shot a picture of the strange object. This was virtually instantaneous because the shutter speed was fast. The bird (the wind was from the north east) for several hundred feet, stopped for a few seconds and with a tremendous burst of speed, it shot over our heads into the south east.

I am not a UFO expert, but it is my guess as to the speed of this object from a dead stop to full speed would have to have been in excess of five or six hundred miles per hour. As it passed over our heads it could have a high pitched whining sound, but no motor noise.

The light from the object continued to change and pulsate from orange to white to a dull red glow as it passed over and disappeared from our sight into the evening sky.

It was a clear evening, no clouds of any kind, only two stars were out. One bright star in the south west, the evening star and one very faint star another to the right of the first. This, then, does not show on this negative, but it does show on my color slide.

Film NO. 126-20. I had my camera with ASA 50, with Kodacolor-X color slide shooting at inclinity.

I would be happy to give any other information or answer any questions in regard to this UFO that you may have. I would appreciate it very much if I could have the negative with your report or answer as to what this might have been.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature Area Blacked Out]
