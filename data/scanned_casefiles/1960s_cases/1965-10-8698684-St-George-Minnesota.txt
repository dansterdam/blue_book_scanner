The image provided contains a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph attached to this report. The report provides an analysis of an "unidentified flying object" sighting that occurred on 23 October 1965 in the vicinity of New Ulm, Minnesota. The key points from the text of the report are:

UNCLASSIFIED
PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 65-59
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
LOCATION: VICINITY NEW ULM, MINNESOTA
DATE: 23 OCTOBER 1965
PHOTOGRAPHY: ATTACHED (2) KODACOLOR NEGATIVES AND (2) PRINTS
QUALITY: GOOD
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 65-134, submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, USAF/UFO for an analysis of the attached negatives and two prints.
ANALYSIS: The setting for the photograph of the alleged UFO was 1810 hours, 21 October 1965, in the vicinity of New Ulm, Minnesota. The photograph depicts a probable circular shaped object on the negative.
The lack of a definitive signature to the light spot and the dense background completely devoid of objects of any kind, preclude an interpretative type analysis. Further, the identification of what could be made from the information provided, cannot be determined conclusively.
The following comments in reference to the negative/prints and information furnished are given in support of the aforementioned negative analysis:
a. The one negative furnished is a copy and all probability, not processed by Kodak Laboratories. Kodak uses only color intermediate film (Type 5270) for transparencies. Further, the source letter indicates the original photograph was shot with Ektachrome film whereas the reproduced negative furnished shows Kodacolor film.
b. The reproduced negative furnished does not show a frame marking around the photographed area. It is extremely unlikely that a camera exposed negative will fail to show a frame marking.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-59, DATED 29 DECEMBER 1965

Scene contains a constant density of background surrounding the alleged UFO is questionable. In view of the foregoing, an analysis of the original negative might prove beneficial, even if only to clarify the above comments.

Transcription of the text in the document:

DEAR SIR:
On the night of 8 October 1965, at approximately 9:45 p.m., I had an unusual experience of seeing a UFO that took place several miles southwest of Minnesota. I was driving from my place of employment, the Green Giant Cannery, when I noticed a bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was just an aircraft light, but as I continued to observe it, I realized that it was much larger and brighter than any normal aircraft light. 
The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a brilliant white light. It was hovering approximately 500 feet above the ground and approximately 2 miles from my location. The light from the object was so bright that it actually illuminated the area around me as I was driving. I watched this object for approximately 10 to 15 minutes as it hovered silently in the sky. 
After several minutes, the object began to move in a northeasterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. As it moved, the brilliant white light suddenly changed to a reddish-orange color. Within a matter of seconds, the object disappeared from sight. 
I was very excited and amazed by what I had witnessed. I can assure you that this was no ordinary aircraft. The size, brightness, and manner of flight of this object were unlike anything I have ever seen before. I would be more than willing to discuss this incident with you in greater detail if you so desire. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
