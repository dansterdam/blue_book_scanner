Held up a completely small. It appeared about the size of a house at altitude but just a lighted shape.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was more than one object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

At first it appeared as a star, then it seemed to double - it hung, perhaps, I was getting a double image through my glasses but finally could see that it was elongated and not double.
