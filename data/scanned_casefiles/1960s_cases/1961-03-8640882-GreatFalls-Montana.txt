ALTHOUGH THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST ACCURATE OF ANY HEARD. THE 25TH
ADIV SAGE ADC IS SENDING MESSAGES CONCERNING THOSE REPORTS.
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS WOULD INDICATE EITHER THE REENTRY OF A SPACE
VEHICLE OR A METEOR. HOWEVER, THE FACTS THAT THE WEATHERMAN ADVISES
THAT THERE WERE NO CONTRAIL LEVELS, THE REPORTED INITIAL BURST AND
ESPECIALLY THE DEFINATE INTERRUPTION OF THE WHITE STREAM, WOULD SEEM
TO POINT TO A SPACE VEHICLE.
OTHER REPORTS CORRELATED WITH THIS ONE BY TIME AND, TO SOME EXTENT
BU TEXT, SEEM TO PLACE THE FALL SOMEWHERE NEAR KELLOGG, IDAHO
