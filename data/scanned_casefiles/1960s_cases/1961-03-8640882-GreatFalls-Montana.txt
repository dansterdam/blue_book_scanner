This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an incoming message from the Department of the Air Force. The message discusses reports of unidentified sightings, including one that seems to indicate the possibility of a space vehicle or meteor. However, the weather report indicated there were no contrails, and the initial burst and especially the reported interruption of the white stream would seem to point to a space vehicle. The message also mentions other correlated reports that may place the fall near Kellogg, Idaho.

PAGE FOUR RJWZGU 1A

ALTHOUGH THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST ACCURATE OF ANY HEARD, THE 25TH ADIV SAGE ADC IS SENDING MESSAGES CONCERNING THOSE REPORTS. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS WOULD INDICATE THE REENTRY OF A SPACE VEHICLE OR A METEOR. HOWEVER, THE FACTS THAT THE WEATHERMAN ADVISES THAT THERE WERE NO CONTRAIL LEVELS, THE REPORTED INITIAL BURST AND ESPECIALLY THE DEFINITE INTERRUPTION OF THE WHITE STREAM, WOULD SEEM TO POINT TO A SPACE VEHICLE.

OTHER REPORTS CORRELATED WITH THIS ONE BY TIME AND, TO SOME EXTENT, BUT TEXT, SEEM TO PLACE THE FALL SOMEWHERE NEAR KELLOGG, IDAHO.
