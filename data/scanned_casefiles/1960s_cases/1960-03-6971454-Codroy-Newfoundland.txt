10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Dark, barrel-shaped objects, six to eight feet long, black to blue in color, trail of flames six to eight feet long, no sound, appeared to fall straight down to earth.

11. COMMENTS
Since there was but one witness, this sighting claimed as "insufficient data." It is quite possible that this was a meteor or similar astronomical event, but the limited information precluded a definitive identification or conclusion.
