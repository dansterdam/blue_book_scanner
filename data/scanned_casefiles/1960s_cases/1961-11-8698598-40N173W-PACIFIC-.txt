Science News Letter for October 28, 1961

Look for Jupiter Early

Jupiter can still be seen in the evening sky during November in the constellation Capricornus. The winter constellations are making their appearance, James Stokley reports.

> THE PLANET Jupiter is still prominent in the evening sky during November, but you have to look soon after the sky darkens. Only two months ago it was visible until midnight, and even in the early morning. But at the beginning of November it sets soon after 10:00 p.m., your own kind of standard time; and about 8:30, at the end of the month.

If you look earlier in the evening—even before the sky is entirely dark—you will see it in the southwest, in the constellation of Capricornus, the horned goat. It is so much brighter than any other planet or star now visible (magnitude magnitude scale) that it appears first. And a little ahead of Jupiter, toward the right, stands another planet—Saturn. It is about an eleventh as bright as Jupiter, although still equal to a first magnitude star.

Neither Jupiter nor Saturn are shown on the accompanying maps of the November evening skies. These depict the heavens as they look about 10:00 p.m. at the first of November, about 9:00 at the middle of the month and 8:00 at the end. Thus, these planets are just below the southwestern horizon. For the star make a brilliant display, for we are beginning to see some of the constellations that make the evening skies of winter so glorious.

For example, look over toward the east. There, a little above the horizon, you will see three moderately bright stars in a vertical row, with brighter stars to the right and left, and another quite a bit above.

The three stars in a row mark the belt of Orion, the warrior. Of the two bright stars, the one to the right, which was placed one of his feet in the old star map, is called Rigel. The one to the left is Betelgeuse, in his shoulder. When he is seen in this part of the sky, Orion is on his back. He is upright when he climbs higher in the south.

The star above, which is distinctly red in hue, is Aldebaran, part of Taurus, the bull. And further to the left (on the map of the rather southern sky) is Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer. Below this constellation is a group called Gemini, the twins, whose brightest stars are named Castor and Pollux.

Turning toward the northwest two more bright stars are visible. The lower is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, while the one above Deneb, in Cygnus, the swan. Further to the left, a little lower than Vega, is Altair, in Aquila, the eagle. Here again we have three stars in a row, but there is little chance of sunrise.

For a few days around this date you may be able to see it, near Venus and considerably fainter, as dawn is breaking. Mars, the third planet, cannot be seen at all this month because it is too nearly in the same direction as the sun.

Mid-November is the time of one of the most famous of the meteor showers, the Leonids. On any clear, dark night, if you watch the sky for a while, you will see a meteor, or shooting "star." Actually these are not stars at all—merely small bits of cosmic debris that enter the earth's atmosphere from outer space where they encounter so much friction that they burn up in the flash of light one sees.

During any night a single observer can see about seven such meteors per hour, on the average. There are always more after midnight than before; in the early morning hours we meet them best on, while those seen in the evening have to be moving fast enough to catch up to the earth.

These sporadic meteors may move in any direction across the sky. At certain times of year, as around Nov. 16, many meteors are seen to radiate from one particular region. For the November meteors this is the constellation of Leo, the lion, which now rises around midnight.

The effect is actually one of perspective. For the meteors are moving around the sun in a huge swarm that follows the orbit of a comet lost in 1866. The orbit of this swarm crosses the earth's path in mid-November.

[The document also includes two star charts with constellation maps and a note about star symbols]

Here is the text from the document:

thus, every year at this time, we meet
them coming into the earth's atmosphere in
parallel paths. But, just as the parallel tracks
of a railroad seem to converge in the dis-
tance, so do the tracks of light made by the
meteors seem to converge. It happens that
the point of apparent convergence is toward
Leo, and that is why they seem to radiate
from that part of the sky. They are there-
fore called the Leonid shower of meteors.

In some places the Leonid swarm is
much more concentrated and when the
earth encountered these in past years, there
was a shower of meteors of extraordinary
brilliance. One of them was in 1833, the
year the stars fell on Alabama. This year,
however, about Nov. 16, you should see an
average of 15 to 20 meteors an hour, in-
cluding the strays that do not belong to the
shower. There will be more after mid-
night. Not only will we then be able to
meet them head-on, but the moon will then
have set. It is at first quarter on the 15th,
when it sets about midnight.

                                                                   Chadron, Nebraska

"ANGEL HAIR" IN NEBRASKA: A weird unidentified flying object streaked across the skies near Chadron, Nebraska, 15th, and deposited a strange substance on a farm owned by Thomas Cox, seemingly metallic substance came off the flying object in thin fibers not settled to earth, draping itself like a final-hair thread over soft's fluids, trees, car, etc. Says John L. Boyes of Chadron, I was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I had been working in my shed. I came outside and happened to look up and saw this strange tall flying through the air. It seemed to be rolling as it went through the sky. I was going toward town and it just disappeared from sight when it got out of the sunlight. It made absolutely no noise. Some chunks of a more soft, and loose fibers began settling down on everything. The oddest thing of all is that the fibers are so thin that they cannot be seen with the naked eye except when they are in direct sunlight. They can be felt on the skin like spider webs, but they are much smaller in diameter than a spider web. According to the report, a human hair seems like a rope in comparison. The fibers can not be picked up, as they are so fine that you can't tell when you have one, and they can't be broken apart, though they can be turned. Fibers used by the Air Force for radar-jamming are much thicker than these, it is said.

Here is the text from the document:

November 8, Chadron, Nebraska.--A "metallic deposit of "seemingly metallic fibers" was left on the Theodore Goff farm following sighting of a UFO. Mr. Goff attempted to preserve some of the substance by covering it with canvas, but it dissipated before investigators arrived. (Similar to other "angel's hair" incidents.)

At the top of the page, there are also two handwritten notes:

November 8, near Popular Grove, Ill. --
Floyd G. Germann and his son saw three
"disc-shaped" objects about 7:15 a.m.
while discussing "the UFOs" appeared
"bright as if of highly polished metal,"
and were visible through broken clouds,
estimated to be at 4000 feet. "A dis-
cussion among the apparent di-
ameter of the full moon, and moved in a
straightline formation."

No Case (Information Only)                   10 November 1961
Baltimore, Maryland

Baltimore, a metallic, circular, spinning, greenwhite lighted humming ob-
ject, was seen by several residents on the night of Nov. 10th. One of the wit-
nesses said that the white lights were fading brightly, as if through punc-
tures in the bottom of the craft, and there was a green light forward.

November 10: Baltimore, Md.—A cir-
cular, metallic-appearing UFO which
maneuvered for over the area at night,
then went straight up, was reported by
several witnesses. Thomas Lane and many other resi-
dents of northeast Baltimore. Witnesses
said the UFO was spinning, had a green
light on the leading edge, and white lights
on the bottom resembling punctures in the aircraft. Pending further investigation, sighting
activity was being studied.

SAUCER PHOTOGRAPHED IN HAWAII. The picture above was taken last November 21st by Masa Akita of Lihue, Hawaii. It is one of two pictures which he took within seconds of each other while the UFO hovered briefly over Kala-paki Beach. The object then zipped away so quickly that it disappeared from sight almost instantaneously. According to the report, no further details are available.
