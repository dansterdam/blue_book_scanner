light standing stationary in the sky, then moving off, stopping and reversing course immediately to chase another airplane, I thought I'd betterx turn in this report. The Ashland man said his sighting was to the south. And, because Ashland is north of Richmond, and my sighting was to the north, it is probable that we both saw the same thing.

Here is the text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you or compared to objects with which you are familiar? About the size of a large plane light

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of this object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It first disappeared temporarily, followed a clumpy of hazy something on vision and at last disappeared over the horizon going east

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or object which, when placed up in the sky, would give some appearance as the object which you saw: When it was standing still, it seemed to be a round light, slightly reddish. It changed to a smaller and whiter light - when moving across our field of vision. It was apparently about four miles to the south and two hours feet up, except when descending from higher altitude. Distant the size of a large plane.

What ever the object was, it definitely descended from a high altitude to that which the plane was handling almost a short time took off to melt the plane ( reversed it self after passing the plane and followed the path of the plane out of one sky to the Earth. It was traveling at a more rapid route than the plane because it traveled almost to the verge of reversed it self and had almost come up with the plane when they disappeared in the east.

Jupiter, Saturn Shine in August

The planet Jupiter is the brightest object in the sky next to the moon during August. Saturn is as bright as a first magnitude star, James Stokley reports.

American Motor Society Report
For 1967 by Dr. G.R. Olivier

1952 April 25.69 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2395

In our files are found 12 reports of an extremely brilliant fireball which appeared on the above date at 11:18 p.m., E.S.T. Out of the 12 reports 10 came from Wilmington, N.C., one from 3 miles south, one from 25 miles north, so all observers lay along a southwest line. The reports were gathered by Donald Strayhorn of Wilmington, then an active A.M.S. member. This report was unanimous that the fireball's color was blue or green and its size excessive, estimates of the latter running from one half to three times the size of full Moon. Allowing for probable exaggeration, its apparent diameter must have approximated 15' to 20'. Based on 9 estimates, the duration was 3.06 ±0.76 sec.—a smaller average error than usual. From 9 stations the path was reported as nearly vertical or almost vertical, with the beginning altitude as 48° and the end point at about 5° altitude. As the azimuth time was about 13:33, the right ascension of the radiant would, for a vertical path, approximate that. No information on the radiant's declination nor linear heights can be obtained from the data. Its path probably ended near the VA.-N.C. border. Evidently, however, it was not from the Lyrid radiant, but may well have come from A.M.S. fireball radiant No. 3056. Though all the usual results could not be obtained it seemed worth while to put this remarkable fireball on record.

FIREBALL of 1961 August 10.61 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2294

On this date at about 3:32 p.m., C.S.T., a fireball was observed from the Chicago-Milwaukee area, and some 250 reports were gathered by the Adler Planetarium and eventually sent to A.M.S. headquarters. There has been a long delay in solving the path of the principal body to which these reports refer. A detailed study indicated that 30 or more referred to a second bright object, seen to the northeast, while, due to the date, Perseus were doubtless present in numbers and some observers did not differentiate. Despite these complications, a solution has finally been obtained. Unfortunately only about 5 people tried to refer the path or end of it to stars. Ursa Major being so used. All the rest deepened - upon estimates of both directions and altitudes, nobody seems to have used any instrumental data.

A preliminary study weeded out half of the reports as having no value for either coordinates. Further, estimates of altitudes of 60° and over were omitted, an almost nobody, without using stars as reference, can estimate such areas with even approximate accuracy, and heights depend upon the tangents of the angle, which become abnormally great over 60°. To determine the projected path, a chart of the region was prepared, scale 1° in latitude to 1mm. On this stations were plotted and azimuth lines drawn showing the observed projected starting and ending points, and in addition the chart shows the computed path of the fireball's principal body and the projected path drawn. Then the linear height corresponding to observed altitudes were derived by measuring the distance to projected path from each station and taking the tangent of the altitude. Most did not see the beginning point, but our derived beginning height depends upon 13 usable altitudes. The end point depends upon 43 altitudes. Joining these points by a straight line gives us the atmospheric path. Other estimates could be bunched into three heights. When plotted, these fit in tolerably well.

While the average deviations from the mean heights certainly show larger values than we could wish, yet in percentages they compare very favorably with those all observers get when measuring stellar parallaxes, and the latter are the very basis of stellar astronomy. So we beg the indulgence of astronomers and suggest that, while in a given case the fireball path and orbit derived certainly may be considerably in error, still statistically, they may be treated with more respect.

American Meteor Society Report
No. 9

The color of the fireball was white perhaps with a bluish tinge, but during the last part of its flight, when lower in atmosphere, it turned red. Its train was yellowish or red, but duration of this most uncertain. The fireball itself showed a distinct disk, but no certain numerical magnitude can be given. Estimates of duration, leaving out impossibly long ones, are from 1 to 25 seconds. Probably the longer ones refer to duration of the train. Using the average of 13 estimates, the velocity was estimated at a velocity of 30 km/sec. which is obviously most uncertain. The object broke into two or more pieces near end. Estimated of brightness vary widely, but undoubtedly to many it showed a disk. Using the reports which seem more accurate its magnitude is seen from Chicago would have been -8, which incidentally would be near the zenith magnitude. Our thanks go almost exclusively to Adler Planetarium as the staff there at once recorded most of the reports by telephone, while what they had seen was fresh in their minds. An examination of their data follows. An examination of them will show marked similarities to A.M.S. No. 2338 observed on August 16 1936.

FIREBALL of 1966 July 6
A.M.S. No. 2393

A very bright fireball was reported on this date at approximately 10:58 p.m., E.S.T. from stations in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa. However, the Illinois report must be of another fireball, almost simultaneous, as its path does not agree with other data. We then have available 9 reports, 6 kindly sent in from Wright-Patterson AFB. Considerable time and effort have been spent in trying to secure a good solution; what is here given is far from fully satisfactory, but is the best the data afford. Three observers report its brightness was comparable to the Moon's, one that it cast distinct shadow, two gave its train length as about 5°. Its velocity was about 36 km/sec. The duration of flight was 2.75 ± 0.5 sec. 8 observers. Its color was blue green. No long continuing train was left. It flared once. The usual data follow but no orbit is computed due to the relative uncertainty of the atmospheric path.

14 August 1961
Chicago, Illinois

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - 14 Aug 61: Steve Faver, a 17-year-old student has reported to CUFON what may or may not have been a singular me-
disappearing over a building several blocks away in about a minute's time. He didn't
see the object come into view as he was watching Echo I to the east.

The general appearance and direction of this object bring into mind the red-
dish object seen by Adler Planetarium personnel almost one year before (26 Aug 60);
one of cases such sightings at that time. (See January and July, 1961, issues for
details) It is rather puzzling that such sightings should occur with such timing.

Starr, an amateur astronomer and, curiously, formerly a member of the Adler
Planetarium Society, said in his report to CUFON, "It do not think it could have
been a meteor since it traveled almost from horizon to horizon." Besides, the
color (being too dull) prompts me to think that this was not a meteor.

He has viewed many meteor showers and said this was not similar to any meteor
he had ever seen. Asked what he thought it might have been, he replied, "I hon-
estly do not know."

No Case (Information)

17 Aug 1961
Stillwater, Minnesota

Aug. 17, Stillwater, Minn. Five citizens witnessed a V-formation of glowing lights, moving about 500 feet above the St. Croix River. Lighting resembled the "Lubbock Lights" (Texas, 1951) except that the V (few on edge, point forward). The lights moved in unison. Two witnesses reported the sighting as "a solid V-shaped object with body lights."

Aug. 19, Farmington, N.M. At 6 p.m., a flat, round object was seen hovering by several witnesses.

Smith reported to NICAP: "When I first saw it, it was stationary. Suddenly it took off with a tremendous burst of speed. It climbed, all the while accelerating."

Aug. 21, Bayview, Idaho. Two bright glowing objects, one of which exploded were seen manoeuvring over Pend Oreille Lake by J.M. Wilson and his family. In a duplicate AENIGAB re-port, Wilson said one object flared up as if exploding, and disappeared. Moments later, a second UFO appeared and circled the explosion area. Afterward the three for two minutes, it shot straight up out of sight.

CIVILIAN UFO RESEARCH - NO CASE INFO ONLY

30 Aug 61, at approximately 9:07 P.M. At that time a man saw an object apparently following Echo I across the sky. When first seen, the object was about 10° to the left rear of Echo I then last seen.

Having had little training in astronomical matters, we called upon Tom Coombs, Deputy Director for Moonwatch Activities at the Chicago Moonwatch Station. Tom, taking the estimated time and speed (in comparison with Echo), checked the orbital prediction sheets he receives from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Using some "hastily ingenues mechanics" far beyond our mental powers, he learned that 60 Epsilon I (Sputnik IV) would have been in that area at that time, disappearing into the earth's shadow shortly after 9:07 P.M. Moonwatch Chicago lost track of the satellite on 15 May 60, so the Chicago team wasn't expecting it.

Is a bout same time that Echo and its magnitude as 1.5, the team using sighting gave a rough speed estimate of twice that of Echo; a magnitude guess of 2.0.

There is little doubt, therefore, that the Evanston object was Sputnik IV. We are indebted to Tom for his assistance. This is an example of what could happen in UFO research if private organizations and public research facilities would work together.

EVANSTON, ILLINOIS - 20 Aug 61: Roderick Aguilliard was also watching Echo I.
The time was between 9:00 and 9:15 P.M. The metallic satellite had just passed zenith when he noticed a star-like object about half the brightness of Echo I. He left rear at a distance equal to twice the moon's diameter (about 1°). In the estimated 45 seconds of observation, the object had closed the distance to about 1/8. Going the same direction as Echo.

This case is undergoing further study. A follow-up may be expected.

Dear Major Coleman:

At about 2100 hrs. on 30 Aug 61, a reddish object was seen over Cincinnati, Ohio, as it traveled very slowly across the sky until it suddenly exploded in a flash of white light. At the same time on the night of 5 Sep 61, the performance was repeated.

I would like to know the results of the official investigation into these sighting and the facts on which these results were based.

- On 7 Aug 61 I requested information regarding two Chicago area sightings of a few years ago. If possible, would you please inform as to the action being taken on this request?

If a Department of Defense news release regarding UFO's has been issued since January, 1961, I would like to have a copy.

Your help in these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Dear Major Coleman:

On 10 June 1961, as your request, I sent you information regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early in January 1961. I would appreciate knowing, in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 8, the outcome of the official study into this sighting.

Would you please send me a copy of the latest DOD News Release on the subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two Chicago-area sightings. (4 Nov 57, Elmwood Park; 19 Jul 58, Des Plaines, Ill.) I have been trying to obtain information about these incidents for over a year. If I cannot get it through normal channels, I may be forced to seek assistance, as I have done before.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of UFO reports (30 Aug 61; 5 Sep 61) over Cincinnati, Ohio. I would like to know the official conclusion in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 8.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are competent for the work you are doing. I hope you will provide the information requesting, thereby insuring the characteristics will remain unchanged.

Sincerely;

CINCINNATI, OHIO - 30 Aug 61: (Approximately 9:00 PM) Dozens of Cincinnati residents watched a flickering red light moving "very, 
slowly" toward the southwest. It suddenly exploded "like a great white light". Witnesses scattered over a wide area gave remarkably similar descriptions.

A spokesman at Greater Cincinnati Airport rejected the possibility that aircraft were involved. The Cincinnati Weather Bureau could offer no explanation.

Thomas Van Flandern, Neanderthal of the Cincinnati Moonwatch Team, ruled out meteor, star, satellite, or other space phenomena.

- 5 Sep 61: First incident, the object (or a similar object) appeared over the city for a second time with the same results. Two additional observations were made this time, though witnesses closer to the object heard a soft explosion-like sound just as the object exploded. Also, the object was seen below clouds which the Weather Bureau said were at 10,000 feet, thus the object was most likely between 5,000 and 10,000 feet high.

- 11 Sep 61: The above sightings were precisely six days apart and were quite similar in nature. Six more days passed and at 8:57 PM, Sept 11th, CUFOS member Ann Mattix (who sent in the above report) saw a reddish-white light travel from the northeast to the southeast at a high rate of speed on a slightly erratic course. Although similar in appearance and direction of movement, some obvious differences appear in this latest sightings. The object traveled at high speed, the was no explosion (thus witnesses were at the bottom of a hill, however, which might have prevented them from seeing an explosion further along the object's course); witnesses heard a sound not unlike a jet engine as the object approached the southwestern horizon. Whereas the earlier cases involved a training operation, it is possible that this object was an aircraft and the time was part of a training operation. Strategic Air Command aircraft, which may have dropped flares as part of a training operation.

- 17 Sep 61: Mrs. Mattix and her husband intend to maintain a "skywatching" on the sixth night following this sighting. Anything gleaned from this operation will be reported.

DATE: September 5, 1961

Somewhere between 8 and 9 p.m., as I was walking across my back yard from the house to a tool house, I looked up and saw what I took to be a very brightly-lighted airplane, moving from east to west.

My first thought was that it was an aerial tanker of the Tactical Air Command, which has headquarters near Richmond; but I checked with TAC and it did not have any tankers in this area at that time.

Also, I checked with the Air Traffic Control radar people at Richmond's Byrd Field, to see if they had picked up anything unusual on their screen Thursday night, and they said they had not. This sighting of mine would have been well within range of the Byrd Field radar.

After calling the Air Force in Washington, I had about decided that this was a civilian airliner, with its bright cabin lights visible through porthole because it was in a slight left bank.

But, because a man had called from Ashland with the story of a bright
