Object was oval shaped and gray in color. The object came downward out of the clouds, slowed to almost a complete stop. The object then sped up very fast and vanished back into the clouds.

On 25 May 67 a report of a UFO was submitted with photographs. The individual involved in this report named the person associated with this 18 Jan 67 sighting as the one who gave them the photographs. It appears that the Swinger has gotten the best of all concerned.

18 January 1968 Boise, Idaho

SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/op/70979/18 May 67

MAY 1 3 1967

Dear Jim:

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object.

Examination revealed the presence of a circular shaped object with some type of protrusion. The initial report stated the photograph was taken at night under cloud cover, yet the object possesses a small degree of high lighting along the protrusion. The background of the photograph appears dark with the exception of the top edge which exhibits a small degree luminosity. Since there was no indication of size for the object, and with the absence of foreground and/or background detail, a careful trace to place the object was peculiar. If the object was traveling as fast as the witness stated, some degree of blurring should have been present.

There are several discrepancies in the report. At one point, it was stated the object was visible for three or four seconds, yet in another part of the report it was stated 20 seconds was the duration of the sighting. Although a positive identification has not been made, it appears that some type of man-made object was involved. There is no evidence in the photography that the object is extraterrestrial.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Your photo is enclosed.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

P NRS     1 Polaroid Print (B&W)                        QUALITY Poor

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 67-31 which replies to a request submitted by Major Quintelle TDETR, to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the submitted Polaroid-type print has negated retouching, and as the object is the only item appearing in the photograph, it could not be determined whether an attempt at double exposure was made. The photography appears genuine in so far as content is concerned, however no satisfactory explanation could be made of the unidentified object. The object appears to be circular in platform, basically flat in cross-section with a domed "superstructure". Source stated that the photograph was taken at night under cloud cover, yet the object possesses a small degree of high lighting along the domed "superstructure". The background of the photograph appears dark with the exception of the top edge which exhibits a small degree of luminosity. The object is located within this anomaly and the result is an apparent highlighting of the domed "superstructure". As source did not indicate a size for the object and with the absence of foreground and/or background detail, a scaling factor to size the object was precluded. There is no evidence in the photography that the object is extraterrestrial.
