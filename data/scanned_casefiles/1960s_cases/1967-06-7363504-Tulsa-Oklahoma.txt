To whom it may concern:

On the evening of June 21, at approximately 22:30 pm my friend and I sighted an unusual object in the air due North Northwest from my house. It was very unusual in that it seemed to move somewhat straight down from nowhere and almost stopped then shot into the North Eastern direction and disappeared. My friends and brother saw a bank of clouds. My friends did not see the object due to the fact that it happened so suddenly and was gone in a few brief seconds, being that we live close to the Tulsa International Airport we was positive that it was no other airplane nor satellite. In the few brief seconds we saw it we could tell it was no conventional aircraft it had no wings that we could see and it was circular in shape and very bright. Approximately three hours later we were looking at the stars through my binoculars when we of this group sighted

another strange object moving more north
Easterly direction with a considerable
rate of speed since we had been aware
me took advantage of the opportunity and
all of the group looked at it through the
binoculars, due to the bright light
emitting from it, we could not make
out an outline. It was low enough that
we could tell it had no running lights
as an airplane does, we took three
time exposures with one camera which
is a Ball film all electric system
which is in excellent condition, we took
the film to the drug store, and left it
to be developed, when we went back
to get it on the assigned day the
film hadn't come in, and we were told
to come back the next day. We returned
the following day and received one
pictures but there were no pictures
of our UFO and there were no negatives
of the pictures we took.

We all agreed that this is an
accurate account of what happened
