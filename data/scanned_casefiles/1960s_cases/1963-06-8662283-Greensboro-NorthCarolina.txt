Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
18 min

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
NE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Extraordinary bright object flashed from the meridian to the North. Then saw star that moved very slightly to the East. Thought to be running light of a/c, but believed to be at extreme altitude and running lights not visible. Nothing other than light. Peculiarity in that speed lacked uniformity and had sudden lateral movements. Jerky motion emphasised. Moved like WM balloon except it went over horizon too fast.

11. COMMENTS
At 1150 PM, "ECHO" was heading NE North of the city at 44 deg elevation, in a position to be observed by the witness

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Other Satellite ECHO T
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

1. Sighted 2345-1003 by myself and
lady companion of June 14 from
Skyline Drive - In Hislee, El. S. 29
North Near Greensboro

2 - At approx 2345 Meteorite of extremely
bright intensity in varicolar hues
flashed from meridian to north

3. About two minutes later saw
object at first mistaken for star
appear to move very slightly to east

4. Attempted to identify it as running light
of aircraft but movement was at first
so slow as to be almost imperceptible
except for two flaws which originally
showed close to quarter of initial
appearance affecting a stationary
point for comparison

9. Attention is also called to the fact that the viewing plane (at any guner height) can cause vertical movement to appear as horizontal movement

10. Concluding analysis of preceding two paragraphs lead to noting positive except to strongly emphasize that movement was jerky and erratic, and highly unlike any type of known aircraft movement.

11. It moved very much like a weather balloon except that such are not illuminated and the light remained clear when it disappeared over the horizon to the east. (Approx E.S.N.E. from point of observation) A small light such as would possibly be put on a balloon would be expected to grow faint in the distance prior to reaching the horizon.

5. An aircraft appearing at such an altitude would require unusually bright running lights to appear at all if it is considered that the cruising speed of an aircraft below 50,000 feet about positive movement without difficulty of detection.

6. Object could have been at any altitude and my type as there was no basis for comparison.

7. Speed seemed to increase after first five minutes of observation and it appeared as a running light (tail) of an aircraft although no lights could be observed in conjunction.

8. Peculiarity seemed to be lack of a constant speed and a somewhat erratic motion as though it made sudden lateral movements. Such lateral movements are pure speculation as they were not positive enough to distance to assure perfect definition.

12. Intensity of the light was of the same magnitude at the height star

13. This report submitted for evaluation by Air Force Intelligence for whatever information it is worth. It is carefully considered and all speculation and imaginational eliminated except that which has a direct bearing on observations.
