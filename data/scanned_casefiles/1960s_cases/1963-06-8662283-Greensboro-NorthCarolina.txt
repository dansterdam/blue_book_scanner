Extremely bright meteorite flashed from the northern horizon. Then disappeared. Thought to be a missile or aircraft running light of c/g, but believed to be at extreme altitude. Altitude difficult but estimated 80-100,000 ft. Extremely bright white light, but lacked uniformity and had sudden lateral movements. Jerky motion, erratic movements. Went over horizon too fast to watch further.
11. COMMENTS
At 1150 PM ECHO was heading NE North at an altitude of 44 deg elevation, in a position to be observed by the witness.

1. DGT/TO 33345 - 000.3 - Appeared and ascended in the Southeastern part of the area 8/29. Moved near Greensboro.
2. At approx 2345 - Motorists of extremely bright intensity in various colors flashed from horizon to horizon.
3. About two minutes duration, moved rapidly cross sky - appeared to move very slightly to east.
4. Attempted to identify as a re-entering light, of aircraft, but no evidence could be found to show art to be almost certainly identifiable to any known aerial craft.
Closed with tentative appearance remaining a stationary point for comparison.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be part of a report or document.

9. Attention is called to the fact that the object in question was not always stationary but made a definite movement to appear at horizon.

10. Concluding analysis of preceding two paragraphs: The movement was highly erratic as if some intelligent creature of unknown nature was controlling the movement in a highly erratic manner.

11. The movement next much like a weather balloon as the object drifted up and down and moved from one part of horizon to the east of observers (approx E.S.E. from point of observation) It moved at what would possibly be just on a wind, but a distinct erratic motion seemed to be superimposed on top of this, tending to indicate the presence of a creature of some nature controlling the horizon.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

5. an aircraft appearing at about 5:45 p.m. on 8 June 1963 was observed by a number of people in Greensboro, North Carolina, USA. It was described as being saucer-shaped, metallic in appearance, and brightly lit to apparently light up everything under it. It was reported that the crossing speed of an aircraft-like object was estimated at approximately 30,000 feet per minute without any perceptible movement or difficulty of operation.

6. Object could have been at any altitude and any size as there was no basis for comparison.

7. Speed seemed to increase after that five minutes of observation and it disappeared in a manner that a conventional aircraft could not be observed in confirmation.

8. Recendently seemed to be lack of a complaint speed and a somewhat erratic motion as though it made sudden movements instead of gradual movements, in a manner a conventional aircraft would probably not move.
