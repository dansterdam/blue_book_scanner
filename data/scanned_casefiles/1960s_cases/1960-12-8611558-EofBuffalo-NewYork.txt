The following extracted from 1/Lt Payette's Report dated 8 Jan 61:

2250 hours, received call from Capt [redacted], 4621st Support Gp, Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Niagara Falls, New York. He reported that at 1/4 observed a UFO that appeared about 37 miles SE of Buffalo, New York. In and over the area of Gowanda, N.Y. last five or six days and he wanted to know if we (presumably the Air Force) had anything going on that he should be curious about. He was informed that he should make his report as directed by AFR 200-2 and that he would be contacted regarding his observations. His home phone is: [redacted] and duty phone is SU 3-6601 ext. 301 or 264.

The following, extracted from GMO Tewold's Report dated 7 Jan 61, is quoted for your information:

Reference Lt Repetti's Report. Another phone call received from Capt Norhold, Niagara Falls Airport, references 1760 Report from that Station. Wanted to know if so (ATIC) had done anything about it. Reported a cold him as fact. I knew "No". He stated he was going up again tonight to photograph this object. Of last 5 men on AF Rpt Buffalo area drawn off Alternate Highway, 20. After tonight's photographs their station will make an official UFO Report.

Said this object was seen again as long ago as around Christmas time. I was unable to contact Maj Friend to see if his information was received. Also called Tewold Newhole (place not on Repetti's Report) that our UFO Office would most likely contact his base regarding his observations.

ATTN OF: CAS-G
SUBJECT: UFO Photographs

TO: ATIC (AF/CIN-4E4g)
Wright Patterson AFB
Ohio

Attached are the photographs described in the UFO Report submitted from this station, 7 January 1961. Subject of the attached photographs was later determined to be the planet Venus as seen through a haze (Reference UFO Report from this station, dated 10 Jan 61).

The camera was aimed and focused upon the planet and the photographs were taken at approximately 1930 hours. No artificial light was in the area, with the exception of a flashlight being used by the photographer to assist him in making proper lens and shutter settings.

The source of the objects appearing in the photos is undetermined, unless it resulted from improper film exposure or mechanical failure of the camera. The sky was clear with the exception of a light haze and some broken clouds at approximately 10,000 feet. Such clouds did not inhibit the viewing of the object. The ground was snow covered, and the temperature was approximately 10Â° Fahrenheit above zero.

Analysis and Conclusions: The investigation officer and other personnel listed in this case at altitude several times, and photographic evidence. They also used transits to track the object. The photographs was reported to show nothing but the track of the planet Venus and surrounding stars. A check indicates that the planet Venus was of a magnitude 8-3.5 during the time of these sightings, and it so bright that it appears much closer. Normally, no observations ceased when the object disappeared at 2000 EST, the time when Venus descended. It is concluded that the object observed was probably Venus.

The Datacard of record was reviewed for the object supports this conclusion.
