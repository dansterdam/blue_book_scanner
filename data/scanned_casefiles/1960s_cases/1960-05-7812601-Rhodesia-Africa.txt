Unidentified Flying Object (Rhodesia)

Department of State

Washington 25, D. C.

1. Reference attached telegram #335, from the American Consulate General at Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia.

2. The information is very limited; therefore, no positive conclusion can be reached. However, it is the opinion of the Aerospace Technical Center that the object responsible for this sighting was a very bright meteor called a Fireball.

3. A fireball is defined as a meteor as bright or brighter than -3 magnitude. Bright enough to cast shadows. These meteors may appear white, blue, green, red, yellow, orange, pink or purple. Often a trail is left which may also be variegated, or may change color after being left. Trails, when seen in the daytime, appear as smoke. These meteors may have curved or irregular paths due to irregular shapes, and a fluttering or whirling noise may be associated with them. A good percentage of these meteors leave a persistent train of their path and may leave a cloud of smoke which expands uniformly or in a specific direction. When these meteors are heard or seen to explode they are then identified as bolides.

4. The speed reported in the referenced message is far below that of a meteor. However, this may be due to errors in the timepiece or one or all of the witnesses.

5. If a more comprehensive study of this case is desirable, or required, it is suggested that the following information be forwarded to ATIC:

a. Names and/or positions of all witnesses.
b. Duration of sighting.
c. Prevailing weather at time of sighting.
d. Apparent brightness of object.
e. How object disappeared.
f. Did object leave a trail or have a tail?
