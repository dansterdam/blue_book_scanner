Dear
This will reply to your undated letter, in which you mentioned that you have some information on unidentified flying objects.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it to the address indicated, it may be possible to make an analysis of your report.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest air force base. This allows prompt investigation by specialized investigators who are in a better position to make an on-the-spot evaluation.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the object by consulting the file of photographs and data we are including. We are enclosing these in the event that your report may be similar to some of the reported sightings we have on record.

Dear Sir,

I just sighted a bright light at approximately 3:45 A.M. EST over Tolland, Mass. It was a high altitude object, very bright and moved at a high rate of speed, disappearing into the west. It was visible for approximately 2 minutes. This was not a plane or any known aircraft. I am reporting this in the hope that you will investigate this incident. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely,
