July 17, 1968

Dear [redacted]:

This will reply to your undated letter, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each case has a UFO investigator, who is in a center position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported in UFO in the Project Blue Book report we are enclosing.

Sincerely,
[signature]

Dear Sir,

last night at 168 at
saw a yellow elliptical
object at an elevation
of 50° r on azimuth of
9°. It could not
seem plausible. See
that but the moon
was out & the seeing
was too far it seemed
more than 5° so
it could not be a/either
it was of a different
magnitude than Venus
at that slightly varied
in the 2 minute of
observation. There were
not bright lights my
country.

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 10 MINUTES __ A.M. ☐ P.M.

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
HOUR 16 MINUTES 32 ☐ A.M. ☐ P.M.

4. TIME ZONE: ☐ EASTERN ☐ CENTRAL ☐ MOUNTAIN ☐ PACIFIC ☐ STANDARD ☐ OTHER

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A HAND DRAWN MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS. IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

[Handwritten text in this section is partially illegible]

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON, OR SKYLINE, THE FIRST SEEN PLACE A "Y" ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW ABOVE THE HORIZON THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN.

[The document includes a diagram with a curved line representing horizon angles and an "OBSERVER" point]

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT OR CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
