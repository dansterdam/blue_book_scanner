Dear Mr. ■■■■■:

Your recent report to the United States Air Force of an observation of January 4th, of this year, is similar to many reports received by this office of near planet Mars.

On 4 January 1965, at 0330 am, Mars was high in the sky to the southeast. This phenomenon appears low on the horizon in the East at approximately 1150 pm and tilted obliquely at a rate of 15 degrees per hour. The variation in color, size and appearance can be attributed to atmospheric conditions. The planet Mars will be in the most favorable location of near conjunction throughout this period, the remainder of January and February. The stellar magnitude on the 4th of January 1965 was -0.8. This planet will continue to increase in brilliance throughout January and February.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in unidentified flying objects and your comprehensive report.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
