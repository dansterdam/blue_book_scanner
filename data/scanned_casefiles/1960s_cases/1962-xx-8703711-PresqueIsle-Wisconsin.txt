11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
This case was reported in March-April 1966. Since the actual sighting had occurred some time ago it is almost impossible to check it out. Also due to the time lag the pertinent data has probably become distorted. Therefore this case is considered Information Only.

Here is the text from the document:

April 3, 1966
370 W. Windsor Avenue,
Lombard, Illinois.

The Hon. Gerald Ford, Minority Leader, (R. Mich.)
House of Representatives,
Washington, D. C.

Subject: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Dear Sir:

I have been reading articles in various newspapers concerning your interest in having an investigation by a Committee of the Congress to probe the UFO sightings in Michigan and other parts of the nation.

Both my husband and myself had occasion, four years ago, of witnessing the same flying phenomena. Because it was so identical to the sightings we read of a Mrs. Baugert, of Barrington Hills, Ill., and a Mr. Richard Borer or Borer (Policeman) of Carpentersville, Ill., we thought we should advise you of what we saw. The following is a true account:

Four years ago, my husband and I were on a fishing vacation at Ox Bow Lake, near Presque Isle, Wisconsin, on the Michigan-Wisconsin border, in the heart of the Northern Highland State Forest. As you know, this area is densely wooded, few cottages, an extremely large lake, shaped like an Ox's bow, with 14 islands in it. We were fishing off the pier, about 10:30 P.M.; it was completely dark, but the sky was very clear, which was ideal, for what we were about to witness.

I was looking straight out over the expanse of water and sky, when suddenly appearing from the Southeast, was a very bright and large sparkling attraction, headed on a straight, very steady course. It was midway between the horizon and what we would call straight up, and according to our thinking, it was one or two city blocks distant from us. As soon as I saw it, I called to my husband who looked up and saw it immediately. It stayed on a straight path, parallel to the surface of the water, never dipping or falling. We both watched it for several seconds, and then suddenly all was dark; it was dark in a flash, but did not fade out of our sight. At no time of any distance, was this a large and bright object, suddenly was nothing as when I first sighted it.

This bright flaming phenomena was very clear-cut in appearance and outline, was shaped like a football or sunfish, was very good-sized. It was shiny bright, and gaseous phosphorescent in appearance, a beautiful blue and gray, using of yellow, and white. It fanned out factory, in flame-light appearance, in the shape of a football as I mentioned. As we did not see an object, we feel it could have very well been the exhaust from a possible vehicle ahead of it. It is hard to come to a conclusion as to the place of this bright flame-like thing we saw, however, at the distance it appeared to be from us, as the crow flies, it could have been 30x40 ft. in size.

We do not believe under any circumstances that we saw a natural phenomenon, or a meteor, or much, or that it could have been any reflections of any sort. This was a very well-controlled course, straight, and had all the aspects of a controlled flying object. We have been convinced this was an Unidentified Flying Object.

We would appreciate your acknowledging this letter and information sent you. Thanking you, we are,

Copy to:
Major Hector Quintanilla, Chief of Blue Book Project,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

[Signed] Mr. and Mrs. Richard H. Sellers

Jan. 3 - Mr. [redacted], Vice-President of Fairmont Dye Works
R.I., along with many other eyewitnesses.

During 1962, I was able to uncover two top UFO stories,
which never would have reached the news wires, had I not made
sure they were relayed to proper news sources. These two reports
were only two of many that I personally received and investigated.
There still remained many persons who feared to tell of their
UFO observations, because of military censorship orders or 'open
ridicule'.
These two reports concerned the sighting of three discs that
maneuvered over Woonsocket, Rhode Island and were sighted by
Mr. [redacted], Vice-President of Fairmont Dye Works, along
with a group of other eyewitnesses on January 3, 1962.

January 7, 1962, Auburn, California-- A brilliant object maneuvering in the eastern sky about 8:00 p.m. was reported to the Air Force office by Sheriff's deputy Harry Jansen, who was confirmed by police. When Mr. and Mrs. Harry Jansen called the sheriff's office to report the object, officers from Meadows, Shokes received the report to do a 10-15 review in the area. They through Meadows, Shokes checked it in rays of light apparently coming from the object. NCAP will ask the Air Force for a clarification.

                                RECENT UFO STORIES

CLOSE SIGHTING IN ARGENTINA: The story you are about to read is a SAUCER NEWS exclusive, from the Buenos Aires newspaper "El Mundo", dated January 10th, 1962. The article was sent to us by our correspondent in Argentina, Heving Van Bemmel, and appears here in translation.

A truck driver named Jose A. Filippi made the following statement to "El Mundo": "As we were driving back to Catamarca, late one night, two powerful lights suddenly appeared in the sky overhead. They were following our vehicle. When we stopped to investigate, the lights stopped too. At the same time, the lights separated with surprising agility, the upper light being somewhat higher than the lower one. This is not all that a strange machine was standing near a hundred yards from the road, with an arc of its machine, similar to the upper half of a cone. This object moved very rapidly, then with trials to show the driver that it was not a casual encounter. Later, two or three times, we were moving slowly back and forth in a zigzag manner."

When Filippi was at Catamarca, he went to the police with his story, a group of police accompanied him, and while the police chief, to the place where the machine descended. According to the police report, the machine descended about 300 meters from the road. The machine descended slowly and with a kind of luminosity at a considerable height. The police made a positive reading, but the joined object at clearly seen to everyone.

The chief of this local jury was a tribunal. He stated that, while in his post of arrival, he received a kind of call from headquarters at 5 a.m., in which he was informed of the machine's position. Upon receiving this information, he immediately went to the place of the occurrence and saw the machine. The fact that he never has believed in exceptional occurrences such as flying saucer sightings. But, upon hearing two or three persons talking about the sighting made him, personally, in their company, go to the place to be able to give a full report on the strange episode. (We do not have the following story on what, if anything, the Inspector General found on his own investigation.)

Many visits

[The rest of the text is partially cut off or illegible in parts, but I will transcribe what I can clearly read:]

[First paragraph appears to discuss UFO activity over Jamaica, with observations from January 31st]

[Mentions seeing a bright object, a satellite, and a star coming up slowly]

There were seen an amazing array of bright objects, with a number of them moving rapidly. Some details are described about their movement and brightness.

[The text continues with descriptions of UFO sightings, but portions are difficult to read completely due to image quality]

The document appears to be a report from the Flying Saucer Review about multiple UFO sightings in Jamaica, dated January 15, 1962.
