Dear Sirs:

I had no prior knowledge there were any reports of UFO's when I observed the phenomena drawn on the attached piece of paper. There were no other witnesses at the time. I had asked the Tower operator if he had seen what I had seen. His response was negative but he offered that there had been numerous reports of such phenomena. This was the first I had any knowledge of any previously reported sightings. They did not appear to be on a collision course with the earth's surface. There was no explosion when they passed beneath the horizon. The time was 2352, August 1, 1965.

Respectfully yours,
[Signature]
Charles J. Pisano
Major, USAF Retired.
