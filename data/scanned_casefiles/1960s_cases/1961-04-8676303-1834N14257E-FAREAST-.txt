10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Four objects side of air mass picked up on air intercept radar. Blips were stationary, then moved visually. Two were beside each other, two were farther away. Climbing marine radar 340 degrees. The blips were well marked and showed no characteristics caused by surface vessels.

11. COMMENTS
The essential elements such as speed of the object, maneuvers, if any, type of radar, example or character of operation, equipment condition, weather information in the area, any attempt to close and identify the object and like information not included. This could have been almost anything. Case listed as insufficient data.

Memo (AFCIN-4E), 19 Apr 61, Request for Review
1st Ind (AFCIN-4E1a/Mr. Bryant/jc/74201)                    9 May 61

TO:   AFCIN-4E (Maj Friend)

1.   The report dated 14 Apr 61 from Anderson AFB has insufficient information upon which to base an evaluation. For example, "Description of flight path and maneuvers of object" is not given.

2.   Report dated 17 Feb 61 has been evaluated and evaluation indicates that considering speed of target, a recently body (or meteorite) is about the only possibility if the target was real. The abnormally large size of the blip is not consistent with that type of target. However, Anomalous propagation of equipment malfunction are other possibilities. Check should be made of cognizant agencies to determine if reentry body or meteorites were in area.

3.   Evaluation of report from 864th ACW Sq., Yuma, Ariz., dated 28 Feb 61, indicates chaff drop from most plausible explanation. Check of Air Force activities for possible chaff exercise could be made.
