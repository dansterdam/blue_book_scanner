REPLY TO
ATTN OF: ROBO                                                                   11 April 1966

SUBJECT: UFO Sightings

TO: Foreign Technology Div (TDEM/UTO)
AFSC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. Two sightings were made in the Schenectady, New York area on the evening of 2 April 1966. (Attachments 1 and 2)

2. Although final determination of the attached sightings is not possible, the subject sightings have been compared and the following is the determination of the investigating officer:

    a. Lighting and shape of the object conforms to that of a heli-
    copter. In one report, the mention of the sound of a helicopter is
    noted as well as hovering capabilities. The general movement and alti-
    tudes reported are also relative to that of helicopter operations.

    b. A call was made to Schenectady Airport and Albany Airport on
    11 April 1966 and no helicopter reported in reference to helicopter
    operations for 8 April 1966.

3. Although no helicopter based at the above airports were operating,
    the reason information an available indicates an aircraft of this type or
    possibly a light aircraft. No further determination can be made with
    information available.
