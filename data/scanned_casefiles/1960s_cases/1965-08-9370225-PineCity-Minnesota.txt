We were staying at a cabin located seven miles north of Pine City, Minnesota, on the north end of Cross Lake when we observed these objects (lights). My parents, my wife, and I watched them for approximately one hour, at which time we all went back into the cabin for coffee and a snack.

My wife and I went outdoors again one-half hour later and observed the objects (lights) again for almost one hour (until approximately 1:10 a.m.) at which time we retired; however, the objects (lights) were still visible when we returned to our cabin.

REQUEST FOR UFO INFORMATION

TO: HQ USAF SAFOIN (Mrs Hunt)
WASH D C 20330

REFERENCE the attached letter from Mr. requesting an evaluation of his sighting on the night of 23 Aug 65. Information was taken from the 1410 USAF FORM 40 based on analysis as observation of the stars Capella, Gamma Cassiopeiae, and Nova Herculis. Phenomena was indicated by Mr. at 2300 on the night of 23 Aug 65 as the star Capella was set. At 2330 the star Capella was at 3 degrees elevation and the star Nova Herculis was on the horizon at 63 degrees azimuth. 1 a.m. on 24 Aug Capella had an elevation of 12 degrees azimuth. Jupiter was at 45 degrees elevation and 70 degrees azimuth. The phenomena was a pulsing scintillation, a pulsation resembling a rhythmic flashing on and off of the source of light. This phenomena was known as scintillation, a twinkling of the stars as if they were pulsing on and off. This is likely to occur in a warm atmosphere.
