There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of text from an old document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

THERE IS NOTHING IN THE PICTURE THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS SHOWING A FLYING OBJECT OR ANYTHING UNUSUAL. THE PAGE APPEARS TO BE TYPED TEXT ONLY, WITH NO PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES PRESENT.

The image appears to contain a sketch or drawing of a landscape, likely showing some type of UFO or aerial phenomenon. The image depicts what appears to be a mountainous or hilly terrain, with a body of water in the foreground and some unusual shapes or patterns in the sky above. The text at the bottom of the image indicates that this is from a UFO report document related to an event that occurred on January 29, 1967 in Knox County.
