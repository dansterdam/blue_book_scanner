SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighted by [redacted], Cincinnati, Ohio

TO: FTD (TDEM)

1. On 1 February 1967, at 1030 hours, [redacted] telephonically contacted Mrs. JUNE C. HUTCHESON, Secretary, 051 Detachment 501, Cincinnati, Ohio, and related the following concerning her sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object:

a. She called to report that she had seen what appeared to be a single slow moving light - UFO. She stated that she had seen a similar object about a year ago. She stated that at the time she saw the object this time, another female (whom she does not know) saw it too.

b. At 6:10 P.M. on Saturday, 28 January 1967, [redacted] was waiting for her bus, along with another female, and heard a noise. She looked up and saw a streak of smoke going straight up, and momentarily after seeing this streak of smoke she saw a single light just to the right of the streak moving very slowly. She said it appeared that the single light came from behind or among a 2 to 3 cloud strip. The light moved slowly from the Covington, Kentucky area toward the Cincinnati Airport, located in Boone County, Kentucky. There was a wind blowing, in the opposite direction from which the light was moving. She was unable to determine if the motion she heard was coming from the object, and she passed at the time she saw the object. She boarded her bus, which she was waiting for at the time she saw the object, and left the area.

c. She was unable to further identify the object other than it looked like a single, steady, slow moving light. She stated that because of the wind movement she did not believe it to be a balloon.

2. She gave her home telephone number as [redacted] and advised the is a telephone switchboard operator at Dan's Department Store, 6th and Central Streets, Cincinnati, Ohio, telephone number [redacted].

3. This District Office has not contacted [redacted] concerning this matter, and no further action is contemplated.
