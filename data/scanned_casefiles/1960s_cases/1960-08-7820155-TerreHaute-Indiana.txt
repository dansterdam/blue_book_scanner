16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
    a. Sound        There was no sound of any kind.
    b. Color        The objects were white with a slight yellowish cast to them.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
    (Circle One)    a. Fuzzy or blurred
                    b. Like a bright star
                    c. Sharply outlined
                    d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?    Two
    Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document contains some simple hand-drawn arrows in the bottom section of the page.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? The objects that I saw would be about the size of an object between a pin and a pea at arm's length.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
    The match head would cover those objects that were seen. The match that I used is the kind that is in a paper folder and not a small or large stick match as I here is a difference. The object would be like the one in the previous question.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes. They gradually became lost to view. Lost. Lost view. Moved out.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. The only common object that I could use as a comparison would be a satellite. Such as Binto I or about the size of our newest satellite Echo 1.

NAME: [redacted]
SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: [redacted]

On August 13, 1960, at about 11:15 P.M. I was watching for the then newly launched balloon satellite at the Terre Haute, Indiana, Noontag station. With no more vis the satellite, i.e. not, I was previously mentioned in the report an object. I was then watching the satellite and saw what appeared to be a bright object and was given a stop watch and told to time the satellite for a long as possible. As near as I can tell from my observation, the satellite was visible for about 2 minutes.

I was hard to tell while in the vicinity will be to look up by Vega, which was directly overhead. I immediately started the stop watch and calls out to a satellite observer. I care where the objects moving. I was opposite direction I was then told to time then which I was already doing. The other man looked up as I said that by the time the object was coming in opposite direction and we too watched them until he said "Look away to an and 40 seconds.

During the minute and 40 seconds that I watched the objects I followed the lead object mostly. I two or three times I took the binoculars from my eyes and could see the objects quite plainly. I watched them travel from right overhead to about 15 degrees above the horizon. Some western horizon. They were wide out a yellowish cast to them and moved at about the speed of a satellite or a jet. Alone (or very fast) Watched. Occasionally I would look at the second object and then back to the first. The terminator and his son did not watch the object as they hid their eyes on their scope watching the satellite.

After the objects were lost from view and a satellite had passed through the atmosphere, some 15 or 16 minutes later, I was looking around and look for the objects that I had seen. He was unable to do so. I then called the tower at Hulman and was told that there was no aircraft in the area. This is why I sent this letter to Capt. Waldrop.

1. Reference copy of attached letter to L/Col L. Tasker from Mr

2. The ATIC analysis of [illegible] report of an unidentified flying
object, which he reported seeing on 18 August 1960, reveals that the
objects were probably aircraft. These objects were reported to have
angular velocities comparable to that of satellites and appeared as
two 2nd magnitude lights. The direction of motion was generally to
the southwest. It is quite probable that these objects were two high
flying jet aircraft. Mr [illegible] was probably excited because he was
waiting to view [illegible] and had some knowledge of objects reportedly
seen in conjunction with the satellite which had retrograde orbits.

3. It is possible to see the lights of high flying aircraft and not
be able to resolve the outlines, even with binoculars, on a dark night.
The lights seen by Mr [illegible] would be relatively bright running
light on the bottom of the aircraft.

4. Due to the great amount of traffic through the area, it is impossible
to determine the specific aircraft which were probably responsible.

5. Suggest you send me a copy of the statistics from L/Cdr
through June 1960, and also a copy of the latest "Fact Sheet."

Dear Mr [redacted]:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 September 1960 concerning the unidentified flying object you viewed on 16 August 1960.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's analysis of your report reveals that the objects were probably aircraft. These objects were reported to have singular velocities comparable to that of satellite and appeared as two 2nd magnitude lights. The direction and motion was generally to the southwest. It is quite probable that these objects were two high flying jet aircraft.

It is possible to see the lights of high flying aircraft and not be able to resolve the outline, even with binoculars, on a dark night. The lights mean you would be the relatively bright running light on the bottom of the aircraft.

Due to the great amount of traffic through the area, it is impossible to determine the specific aircraft which were probably reasonable.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of 15 August 1960 to Captain Lee Waldrop, Operations Staff Officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio concerning two unidentified flying objects you sighted has been referred to me.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore request you fill out the attached Air Force questionnaire and forward the completed form to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their evaluation and analysis. Two questionnaires are enclosed. In the event there is another witness to this sighting.

Dear Capt. Waldrop

I wrote you once before about aircraft in my area when I was checking for a lady. Now I am checking for myself. I have already checked with both airfields at Terre Haute.

Two objects were seen traveling NE to NSW at a high altitude. Crossed about 40 to 45 degrees of arc in one minute 45Â½ seconds. The lights were white and stayed the same distance behind each other.

Respectfully yours,

Dear Lt. Colonel Tacker:

Enclosed you will find the report form that you sent to me on September 2, 1960. I have filled the report out as best I could. I have several questions that I would like to ask you.

1. When evaluation and annalysis is completed on my report will a copy be sent to me so that I too may know what the Air Force thinks the object was that I saw?

2. How many of all the reports that you have recieved from 1947 to the present concerning U.F.O.s have not been explained away?

3. Will you please send me the present fact sheet out on U.F.O.s?

4. What does the Air Force think those objects are? Is it true that many of the Air Force people think that these objects are from other planets?

Thank you very much for your co-operation in answering my questions.

I am very glad that I have been able to help the United States Air Force.

Respectfully yours,
