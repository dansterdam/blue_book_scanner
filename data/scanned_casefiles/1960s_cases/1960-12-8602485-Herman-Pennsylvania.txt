10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Estimated altitude: 1000 ft. Circular object on a pulsating red light. Along either side of it was, an oblong fiberglass car. Traveled NE, then stopped, then started again. Just before it stopped, a white flash was seen. After it started, almost instantly, it accelerated at a rapid rate of speed. About 1 1/2 minutes later, another flash of light.

11. COMMENTS
Although there were more than one witness, only one saw fit to report the sighting. Witness also report that an a/c was a pulsating red light. The object was apparently stationary, which rules out 3/4 sightings. Case listed as insufficient data due to absence of reports from the additional witnesses.

December 10, 1960

Dear Sirs:

On Monday night, December 5, 1960, about 6:05 P.M. and I were crossing the road that runs from Herman to Butler when we noticed something strange in the sky. We listened intently but heard no sound emanating from the object. We walked further down the road toward the place where the object was apparently stopped. We estimated the altitude to be 1000 ft. From where we stood we could clearly make out a circular object on the forward end of which was a pulsating red light. Along either side of it was an oblong fluorescent glow. About a minute later a plane (presumably a two-engine craft) flew over the object. By means of this plane we were able to contrast the difference in the two.

During this time, the object, which had been traveling in a North-South direction before it stopped, started moving again. Just before it started, a white flash was seen near the red light. Neither of us could tell whether it was inside or outside of the object. After it had started, almost instantly, it accelerated and flew off toward the West flying at a rapid rate of speed. I ran up to the school to get someone else to see.

verify what we were seeing. Within a minute I had managed to round up ten collegians who managed to get a glimpse of the object just before it passed over the horizon. We all stood there trying to figure out just what the thing might be.

About a minute and a half after it had disappeared below the horizon, it (for something similar) was seen coming from the West, a slight distance South of where it had disappeared. It was moving in a westward direction. The rate of speed was a little less than before.

As it passed over the oak grove across the road from the school building, another flash of light was seen, the pulsating red light on the object. It then changed its course and was handed in a Northwest-Southeast direction when it disappeared over the horizon. That is the last time that we saw it. This entire occurrence lasted from seven to eight minutes.

I, myself, thought nothing more about it until later in the evening, when one of my classmates asked me about what I had seen. I told him and he said that someone. He gave me your address. I am writing, I think because it may be of some little value to someone.

Sincerely yours,
