2. LOCATION
GARFIELD, NEW JERSEY

3. SOURCE
CIVILIAN

10. CONCLUSION
POSS. AIRCRAFT

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
ONE

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a bright white light that kept going off and on. The light traveled toward the NW and was seen from 10 - 30 seconds

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
10 - 30 seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground Visual

COMMENTS: Handwriting of "witness" appears to be the same as the observer's. In the original letter, the observer stated that "I at Garfield like a plane coming in for a landing." Since the observation is of only a point source of light and with the information given may be of a satellite, an aircraft or (if it crossed a large arc of sky) a meteor. For this reason, it is being evaluated as Other (POINT SOURCE OF LIGHT).

July 22, 1968

On July 21, 1968 at 11:30 p.m. Mr and Mrs C. A. W. and their daughter Ann were sitting at 14 Ava, Garfield, N.J.

It was going to be a plane or a jet. But this object was to high to be a plane. It came out of the east and went to the west. When we were watching this object it would slow down to such a slow speed we could look at it much longer than before. When it got toward the west it was an orange color. And then we could not see the object. Also this object had a big bright light on it. It all most looked like a plane coming in for a landing. But this object was very big and very high up. There was no clouds in the sky.

Very Sincerely
Yours,
