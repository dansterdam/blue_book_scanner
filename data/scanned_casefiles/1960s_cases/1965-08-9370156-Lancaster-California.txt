1. The following report of an UFO is submitted per para. 14, AFR 200-2 and 200-2A:

a. DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS:
(1) The larger of the two objects appeared round. The smaller object was shaped approximately like a fly wing. No empennage could be distinguished.
(2) The larger object compared in size with a pinhead when held at arm's length.
(3) The larger object was white when first sighted but changed to flashing lights (a bright/dim cycle) as it maneuvered. The smaller object was brownish-gray in color.
(4) There were two objects.
(5) The wing-shaped, smaller object was flying on the left side of the larger object. It then made an extremely rapid maneuver to the right side of the larger object, as viewed by the observer.
(6) Neither object had any discernable features or details.
(7) There was no trail, trail, or exhaust from either object.
(8) There was no sound associated with the sighting.
(9) There were two unusual features:
a.) The very rapid crossover (estimated to be over 3,000 mph) of the smaller object from the left side of the larger object to the right side.
b.) Both objects appeared to increase in size (distance) and then decrease in size (distance). There was no apparent lag by the smaller object due to the crossover.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

the smaller object disappeared rapidly while the larger object remained visible for about 3 minutes. The larger object disappeared rapidly much the same as the smaller object.

(1) The observer heard a light plane in the area and when he glanced up to locate it the two objects caught his eye:

(2) The elevation and azimuth of both objects were 45 and 175 degrees respectively.

(3) The elevation remained at above 45Â° throughout the sighting. The smaller object disappeared from view at an azimuth of approximately 090 degrees. The azimuth of the larger object when it disappeared was approximately 155 degrees.

(4) The flight path was straight with the exception of the maneuver described in (2) above.

(5) The objects disappeared to the northeast due to time and desert haze. The larger object could be seen for about one minute longer than the smaller one.

(6) The larger object was visible for three minutes. The smaller object was visible for about one minute.

NATURE OF OBSERVATION:
(1) Ground-visual.
(2) None.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a document dated August 9, 1965 regarding an incident in Lancaster, California.

Here is the text from the document:

STATED that, if it had not been for the extremely rapid increase in the sizable objects and the flashing appearance of the larger objects, he would not have reported the sighting. His final decision to make the report came only after he had observed the objects for a protracted period in the Los Angeles area.

(SSD in Los Angeles had no reports under investigation that could possibly be related to this sighting.)

He said that the objects could well have been an escort or chase aircraft. However, he stated that their rate of speed and the flashing lights eliminated this possibility as far as he can determine. No one in the area had a flight of this nature, although the possibility remains that an unidentified aircraft could not be ruled out.

Detachment /4, 24 Surveillance Sq (ADO), was queried on the possibility that these sighting were connected with a recogniTion, satellite, or some other military project. They cautioned that this didn't automatically rule out the space theory. The light did not have the dual indication that would have classed it as a satellite.

I feel that the two above explanations are the most plausible. The observer agrees that these may well explain what he saw. It is easy to see if there were an aberration or some sort involved, the observer did not feel there was anything unusual enough to regard the sighting as anything spectacular.

1. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: 
(1) None.
