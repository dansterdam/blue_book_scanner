Dear Sirs,

We are writing to inform you of 4 sightings of something that moved in the constellation Tigo. We have 6 members and 2 scouts. We have 3 pairs of 7x35 power binoculars, Beaneva, 1-75 power telescope, 1-35 power telescope.

The object was sighted at 10:15 posts, by 3 of our members at 10:15 p.m. each night.

The flying was about 70Â° in the southwestern sky in Tigo. It had a cell or a flash with about 5 second between flashes, moving at about 300 mph, in north-west direction. There was no sound although our dogs started howling when it started moving and they stopped when it got out of sight.

We have seen this object 4 nights in a row. Please reply. SEND 1645
