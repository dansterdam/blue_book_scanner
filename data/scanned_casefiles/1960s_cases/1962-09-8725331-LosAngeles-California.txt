REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TD-3/Col Wynn
SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

2 October 1962

TO: HQ USAF
SAFOI-3b (Major Hart)
Wash 25 DC

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted]. This requesting information on unidentified flying objects. This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. It is suggested that Mr. [redacted] forwarded a copy of the DOD Fact Sheet, and that the USAF position in regard to "Flying Saucers" be explained.

3. Request that a questionnaire be forwarded in order that a more complete account of his sighting of 27 September 1962 be obtained. Also, information as to how his estimations of speed and altitude were determined would be helpful in a more complete analysis.

(Based upon the very limited information possessed in his letter, a tentative analysis would be a meteor sighting. Suggest Mr. [redacted] contact Mount Wilson or Palomar observatories in the Los Angeles area for a possible correlation with other meteor sightings.)

Our position: We are primarily interested in scientific and the "immediate threat" potential of an unidentified aerial phenomenon as it relates to our national security. Secondly, we are interested in the "long range threat potential" and thirdly we are interested in possible additional scientific knowledge to contribute to our investigation. That might result from our investigation.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

We are not interested in philosophical matters or Venetians that might be alleged to be flitting about in our atmosphere.

The rest of the document text is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe.

27 SEPT 62

October 5, 1962

Dear M[illegible]:

The Air Force is primarily interested in the "immediate threat potential" of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon as it relates to our national security. Secondly, we are interested in the "long range threat potential", and third, we are interested in possible additional scientific knowledge to our space program that might result from an investigation in depth.

We are no interested in philosophical Martians or Venusians that are alleged to be flitting about in our atmosphere.

May I suggest that you contact Mount Wilson or Palomar Observatories in the Los Angeles area for a possible correlation of facts on meteor sightings.

Sincerely,

W. J. LOOKADOO
Lt. Colonel, USAF
