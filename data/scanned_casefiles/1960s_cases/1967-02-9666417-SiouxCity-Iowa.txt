Air Force Stumped by 'UFO' Photo Taken by Sioux Cityans

[A hand-drawn sketch of a UFO/flying saucer is included in the document]

By GENE ANDERSON
Herald Staff Writer

It was a clear, crispy cool day in Sioux City.
Patches of snow could still be seen on the surrounding hills.

From their vantage point high on a hill, the two teenage boys could see for miles in every direction.

About 5:50 in the afternoon, about an hour before sunset, the boys had returned to town. The camera they had left earlier in the day...

What they were about to see would be really wild.

The 16-year-old youth couldn't wait to discuss it with anyone... even his parents.

He also said there were peculiar grooves across the flat bottoms. They were described as being made of dull metal, not unlike tin. They flew at least several miles, still above the Polaroid-type picture.

By the time he looked at the scale factor to verify the actual size of the object, "They looked more like three-specific details are visible either as a circular object with some type of protrusion.

What did they look like?
Answered the youth, "They were about 20 to 22 feet in diameter, from top to bottom, evidence in the photograph to the letter, signed by Lt. Col. Dale R. Nees, deputy chief of Air Force Operations Branch, Public Information Division, is quite revealing.

"Dull metallic aluminum," said the youth. "Like something in a garbage can," he added.

Did he notice anything else?
"The bottom, which was flat, looked like May, D. C. blocks in the same Polaroid."

A Sioux City priest, who asked to remain unidentified, points to the direction (southwest) from which the unidentified flying object was sighted.

"Each case is objectively and subjectively analyzed, and, if a high school junior, and a junior by class standing, can make such a detailed observation, it lends credibility to the case," the priest said.

The Air Force was stumped by the photo.

[Full text transcription, with some parts potentially illegible due to image quality]

Partial text highlights include:

"Force Investigation, Friday..."
"We were looking in the direction that the second one had..."
"Third One Comes"
"We can't explain it any different..."

On the right side of the document, there is a clothing/glove advertisement with the text:
"WHITE...
SO
RIGHT"

There is also a small illustration of what appears to be a hand/glove outline.

At the bottom right corner, there are store hours listed:
"STORE HOURS:
WEEKDAYS - 8 A.M. -
FRIDAY - 8 A.M. -
SUNDAYS - 1 P.M. -"

And a tagline: "IT HAS BEEN COOL"

The document appears to be a page from a UFO investigation report, specifically from Project Blue Book, discussing a sighting incident.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Left Column]
"...and then with an official Air Force investigation. Finally, they ran opposite to the youth told me one morning going day to a Journal for youth.

"The first one passed over our heads at great speed. We three questions, but said that it was a 'brushing noise'.

"We saw the second one come that Flying Objects. If you will believe it, I stood looking at it, while turned as almost directly in the other boy ran to the car/right path from southwest to northeast. They passed over what they are.

Third One Comes
"We were looking in the direction when we heard something... which we sensed...
We just knew their course was coming from behind us... We went directly over our heads. We did it in our vision for 10 maybe 15 minutes.

[Illustration of a white shoe/glove with text "WHITE... SO RIGHT"]

[Right Column]
...in the same Penta.

"They'll run into back in big towns where they back it."

"Some serious reading about 'saucers' leads one to the business of disprove what they are.

For the Air Force to put the question about the circular object with some type of information, is really quite pertinent.

The Journal Tuesday received an evaluation of that pictured phenomenal.

"Lack of other foreground detail precluded..."

Says the official manual of the Sioux City Air Base.

"The United States Air Force has the responsibility... of investigating flying objects (UFOs).

The program is conducted in three phases. The first phase includes receipt of 175 reports and initial investigation of the reports. The Air Force makes reports the location of a reported sighting is charged with the responsibility of investigating the sighting and following the information to the point.

"If the initial investigation does not reveal a positive identification or explanation, a second phase of more intensive analysis is conducted by the Project Blue Book. All sightings..."

[Bottom right corner has additional text about UFO investigations and some store hours]

The image also contains a detailed line drawing of what appears to be a shoe or glove with the text "WHITE... SO RIGHT" printed on it.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

May 3, 1967

Dear Mr.

We have received some worn from our photographic interpreters concerning the unidentified flying object, photographs submitted by the Sioux City youths and which you have discussed with Major Rhoads of my staff.

A letter from the Project Blue Book office will be going to Sioux City within the next few days, and we know you will want to check your sources to be sure the letter is received before you publish anything. I know you would not want to read about it in the newspaper before receiving their letter.

The photographic analyses revealed that if the witnesses' estimates of the size of the object are correct, the object would be located about 430 feet from the camera. The camera focal length versus the lack of other foreground or background detail used in determining this, scale factor to verify the unusual size of the object. The image is with some type of intrusion, as well as other than a circular object. There is no positive explanation as to the object. However, there is no evidence in the photograph to indicate that the object might be extraterrestrial.

If you wish any additional information, feel free to call.

Sincerely,

EARLE P. MASS

Request for UFO Information

Mr. [redacted]
Sioux City, Iowa 51104

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent observation and photograph of an unidentified flying object.

Photographic analysis revealed that the images is such that no specific details are visible other than a circular object with some type of protrusion. As such, no positive identity can be made of the object.

Analysis revealed that if the object had a diameter of 12 feet, it would be located 430 feet from the camera, but if the object was located 600 feet from the camera, it would have a diameter of 17 feet.

Lack of foreground and/or background detail precluded a scale factor to measure the size of the object.

The original photograph will be forwarded as soon as a copy has been made. The copy is being made for the case history only. Under no circumstances will the photograph be released to the news media.

Thank you for submitting the photograph for analysis.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

P NRS 1 Polaroid print (B&W)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-36 submitted by Major Quintanilla, TDBTS, to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. Examination of the submitted Polaroid-type print has revealed double exposure and/or retouching. The object appears to be circular in platform with a flat-topped "saucer-type" shape. Source: classified photo had a diameter of approximately 12 feet and was located approximately 600 feet from the camera when photographed. The camera used was a Polaroid camera. The results indicate that if the object had a diameter of 12 feet, it would be located 600 feet from the camera, it would have a diameter of 17 feet. Lack of foreground and/or background detail precluded a scale factor to size the object. No satisfactory explanation could be made of the object.
