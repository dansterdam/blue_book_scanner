PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE, TIME GROUP: 25 JAN 67 1730.
2. LOCATION: SIOUX CITY, IOWA.
10. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): THREE BRIGHT DISC SHAPED OBJECTS WITH ROUND DOME.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers watched three "shiny shaped objects" for about two minutes. They were over Sioux City, Iowa. There was no sound or ground effect. They moved in a straight line and disappeared to the northeast. There was a noticeable pulsation or oscillation in the lights which prompted the reflection that this was a spectatory variation due to reflecting changing atmospheric conditions.

AIR FORCE STUMPED BY 'UFO' PHOTO TAKEN BY SIOUX CITYAN'S
A 19-year-old Sioux City boy, Gene Anderson, says he took this picture of a 'flying saucer' in the sky above Sioux City on May 18, 1967. He also said there were peculiar grooves across the flat bottoms. They were described as being made of dull metal, not unlike steel, sparks seemed to be emanating from them. They drew a big 'V' in the sky, he said. Anderson still has the Polaroid-type picture.
By GENE ANDERSON
It was in the late afternoon one day in Sioux City. I decided that more could be seen on the surrounding hills. I hurried home and got my camera, a Polaroid-type, and went back to the spot where I had seen the strange object. The two teenage boys who had been with me could not see it anymore. In a minute or so, it appeared again, hovering about 50 to 75 feet in diameter, its to eight to ten feet deep. I snapped the picture. It darted off extremely fast in an easterly direction. It was about 5:20 in the afternoon. The boys said they had returned to the spot at about 5:10 p.m. to recheck what they had seen, but it had disappeared by then.
I saw scared them badly. They said they had never seen anything like it before. When I showed the picture to my parents, they seemed quite skeptical, although they noticed how disturbed I was. Even an aunt and uncle to whom I showed it didn't seem too impressed. But Col. George Paine, deputy Base Commander of the Sioux City ANG Base, and Maj. W. G. Ruppelt of the same base seemed quite interested when I showed it to them. They told me not to discuss it with anyone else, and I haven't since then.

They said they were studying the picture, and from top to bottom, the image on the picture showed more of an outline shaded in, rather than definite detail throughout. They described the object as being shaped like a submarine, with suggested points on the top, and definite trunnions or skegs underneath. They photographed the picture and sent it to BLUE BOOK for analysis. (BLUE BOOK is the U.S. Air Force's official UFO evaluation project). 
"It's quite possible this is nothing more than a hoax," said the youth, "but I know I saw something, whatever it was."

The image appears to contain a photograph of what looks like a hand-drawn schematic or illustration of some kind of UFO or unidentified flying object (UFO). The illustration is labeled "WHITE... SO RIGHT", suggesting it may be an analysis or interpretation of the object.

Text from the document:

"Project Blue Book is the official United States Air Force investigation of UFOs. The purpose of the investigation is to obtain any scientific or technical information that may lead to the identification and investigation of unidentified flying objects. The program is conducted in three phases. The first phase includes receiving and initial investigation of all reports. The second phase includes field investigations of all reports. The third phase includes laboratory analysis and evaluation of all information obtained.

"Air Force officers in Project Blue Book are responsible for all phases of the investigations. The Air Force officials interview the observers, collect physical evidence, photograph the suspected UFOs and pursue other investigations as necessary to identify the object. 

"If the initial investigation fails to identify the UFO, the report is forwarded to the Project Blue Book Detailed Analysis section for more intensive analysis and evaluation. This section has scientists and technicians who apply scientific methods and analysis to the specific reports. This analysis includes a detailed study of physical evidence, scientific analysis of photographs, and evaluation of witness testimony and other information.

"If the final analysis by Project Blue Book fails to identify the UFO satisfactorily, the case is filed as 'unidentified.' A small percentage of all reports received are filed in this category. For unidentified UFOs, the existing evidence is insufficient to provide a positive scientific identification of the object."

The image appears to contain a diagram or illustration of a UFO or flying saucer. The text mentions "Project Blue Book", which was a real-life U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO reports. The text also discusses the Air Force's investigation of UFO reports and their conclusion that most sightings have natural or prosaic explanations.

The text of the document is as follows:

"On Tuesday, January 24, 1967, USAF Capt. George Fyffe, Project Blue Book Investigator, interviewed Irene Lair and Jeroldine Armbust, two residents of Sioux City, Iowa, concerning a UFO sighting they had on February 9, 1967 at approximately 8:00 p.m. The interview was conducted at the girls' home.

The girls stated that as they were driving home from work on the above date and time, they observed a bright white light on the horizon. As they approached the light, they could see that it was a circular object with a reddish-orange glow around the edge. The object was hovering and seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. They said the object was silent and did not seem to move.

They watched the object for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. During this time the reddish-orange glow dimmed and the object appeared to be rotating. The girls stated that they were frightened by the experience and did not get out of the car to get a closer look.

When they arrived home, the girls immediately contacted the Sioux City Police Department to report the sighting. The police department in turn notified the local Air Force radar site, who picked up the object on their radar. The radar operators stated that the object was on the scope for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before it disappeared from view.

Capt. Fyffe stated that the girls appeared to be sincere in their report and that there was no reason to doubt the validity of their account. He concluded that the object they saw was an unidentified flying object."

The text in the document reads as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

May 3, 1967

Dear Sir:

We have received some word from our photographic interpreters regarding the Sioux City, Iowa unidentified flying object photograph submitted by Mr. Edgar Hornis.

A letter from the Project Blue Book office will be coming to Sioux City within the next few days, and we know you will wish to know what will be contained in it.

The photographic analysis revealed that the image appears to be a slight double exposure of a street scene. It appears to be the camera. The camera focal length was a small setting, thus the object appears larger than if a longer focal length had been used.

The factors to verify the actual size of the object. The chief factors to consider are the scale of the object in relation to the known street scene elements and the quality of the image. The image was of poor quality, thus making precise measurement difficult.

It is indicated that there is no evidence in the photograph to substantiate the claim that an unidentified flying object was present. The photograph appears to be of a simple street scene double exposure.

If you wish any additional information, feel free to call.

Sincerely,

EARLS F. HANCE

UFO Observation
SUBJECT: Sioux City, Iowa 51104
Reference your recent observation and photograph of an unidentified flying object.
We are returning your print, as stated in our letter of 5 May 1967. Once again, we wish to thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Mr. [redacted]" from "INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF, Chief, Project Blue Book" regarding the analysis of an unidentified flying object observation and photograph.

The text in the letter states:

"Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent observation and photograph of an unidentified flying object. Photographic analysis revealed that the image is such that no specific details are visible other than a circular object with some type of perturbation which can be made of the object.

Analysis revealed that if the object had a diameter of 15 feet, it would be detected 1.30 radials from the camera, but if the object were larger, say 30 feet, it would be detected 2.59 radials from the camera, but no further data is available.

Lack of foreground and/or background detail precluded a scale factor to measure the size of the object.

The original photograph will be returned to you under separate cover. The copy is being made for the case history only. Under no circumstances will the photograph be released to the news media.

Thank you for submitting the photograph for analysis.

INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
