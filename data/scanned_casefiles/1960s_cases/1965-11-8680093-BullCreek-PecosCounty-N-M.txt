ATTN OF: 5NB                                                   17 November 1965

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report

TO: FITD (TDEN)
    Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The attached report was received by our Information Services Office. Although the data time group of occurrence is generally compatible with the theme firing, telephonic check with White Sands indicates that no Athena was fired on 12 November 1965.
I have no idea what this might be.

about 4 seconds before losing behind horizon. Was traveling three
times faster than jet he had seen before which he thought was B-52.

The object was dull red in color... white corona... triangular tail...
object was one inch in length... and 5/8 inch in diameter... similar
to comet... only tail was about three times the length of oval object.

sighting... traveling from SW to NE.

Told him we had UFO officer to report his sighting to... perhaps
