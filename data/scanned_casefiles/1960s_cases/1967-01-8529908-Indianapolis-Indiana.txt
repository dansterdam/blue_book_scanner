Observers watched a unidentified light in the sky that was flashing and changing color. It did not move across the sky or move to the horizon. The observer said that the object remained over a fixed area. The object was clearly visible and you could see it round disc. The description is consistent with that of an astronomical body. All stars were visible at the time of the sighting.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains a sketch and instructions for the observer. The sketch shows the angular position of an object in the sky relative to the horizon and compass directions. The instructions ask the observer to imagine themselves at the point shown, and to place markers on the sketch to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen, how high it was above the horizon, and where it was last seen.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they traveled.
