INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVE, USE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING

I was well into the night looking 3 and then I saw a bright white object coming right at me it was coming in a way I felt it was coming right at me it lifted all white and a Christmas tree exp[erience] was a moment round home on a hill top of it in the center both the feel of it and know I am the top guiding with front of the object seemed to be up my bank it while it was would look like that at first as it came right at me it could not make out mark or some marks yet because its object was so blurry and fast and or some markings blurred - at the shadow of a loud Christmas was itself it was a long shadow of a low at the point along with a rough haze on top did not seem to touch the ground pure white along the road I thought it was coming down it was coming my eyes up to my eyes then it might have passed my head without a seem such things as flow over my head without a seem that there are such things as I know but I saw one.

About two years ago, I saw this some pink ribbon in the sky. I had been told that a foreign plane had been given permission to fly. If I am not mistaken it was a Russian MIG. I am sure the sun had formed a pink mist that day. I am wondering why they really wanted the permission. This was why I got concerned. I was wondering that day this was why I got concerned by the pink trail - that at the horizon it made it in the sky. I flew some miles with ships to pick the white parts I now saw many things fresh thru you're mind at a strong sight like this.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

January 8, 1968

Dear Miss [redacted]:

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Always it looked like 2 solid self luminous object, first appeared as 2 small bright star then as it moved it grew larger. At first bright white like Christmas tree ornament, it started towards west. While it was not white, but a dirty color a set with toward the west. It was not and white, and it was white. Then it stood up and moved in mid-near color and then I saw it occur to move with a sort of jerky fast. It was able to go 20 es it informed me all the way. I was able to place the star, but I wanted to add at the moment I did not understand how I could be giving you the facts as I was not close in between the 1st and 2nd object which did it look far away stars are 2 way. I do not know how far away these craft penetrated many miles to earth and was.
