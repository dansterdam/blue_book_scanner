The image contains two photographs. The first is a compass-like diagram with directional labels and text describing it as related to the "phenomenon when last seen." The second is a sketch depicting a person standing on a road between two large cloud formations or hills in the distance.

Now, as requested, I will produce the output of an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system on the text found in the document:

SO HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS SHOWN BELOW. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN A AT A LOCATION ON THE ROAD WHERE YOU FIRST OBSERVED THE PHENOMENON, AND A B AT A LOCATION WHERE YOU LAST SAW IT. DRAW AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE PATH OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE PHENOMENON WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLEST DETAIL AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU SAW IT.

I just happen to notice a while reddish object in the distance and stopped to see it was moving.

Faded out.

Q. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
It moved over a tree. It seemed to be in front or behind was hard to determine the distance; it would say it was on the side of the tree and it was 2 to 3 miles away.
