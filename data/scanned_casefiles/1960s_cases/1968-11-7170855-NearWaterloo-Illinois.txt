The closest relation I can come to is a napalm bomb explosion. Only difference was the brightness. Napalm explosion has jagged edges as this had smooth but not sharp edges.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:

The sighting was just a oblong object which was white and moved very slowly. It was impossible to determine the actual size of speed due to its distance. Also it was hard to hear any sounds due to the distance.

It was bigger than a cloud.

is forwarded for appropriate action.

2. Reference Para 5 of AF Form 117, Mr. Mudd was traveling east on a dirt
road from Wartburg to Burksville at time of sighting.

3. Weather information at Scott AFB during the applicable time period was
as follows:

a. Wind
   Altitude        Degrees        Knots
   Surface         310             8
   6,000           270             25
   10,000          230             25
   16,000          260             40
   20,000          260             60
   30,000          240             115
   50,000          250             70

b. Ceiling: 1,200 broken, 3,000 overcast
c. Visibility: 10 miles, light drizzle
d. Amount of cloud cover: 100% at 3,000 feet
e. Thunderstorms in area: None
f. Vertical temperature gradient: Inversion 5M-9%; the rest normal

4. At the time of the sighting, Scott AFB was overcast; however,
an analysis of the weather charts at 0300Z and 0602Z, 18 Nov, clearly
indicates that the weather to the southwest and south of Scott AFB was
clearing. Although it was overcast at Scott AFB, there is every indica-
tion that the weather near Burksville was correctly described in the
attached AF Form 117.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
