STATEMENT OF DONALD MERRICK, LIVERMORE, AGE 19, SERVING WITH UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, ELY AFB, NEVADA:

AT APPROXIMATELY 0135: WHILE WORKING A C-97 TAIL SIGN AS 504, I WAS REQUESTED BY SUPPLY OFFICER TO PLOT A TARGET THAT WAS AT THIS TIME 13 MILES BEARING 220 DEGREES. THIS TARGET WENT ON FOR ABOUT 9 MINUTES AND THEN TURNED WEST. I CALLED THE RADAR OFFICER BUT HE COULD NOT PICK IT UP ON HIS SCOPE. I THEN CALLED THE TOWER AND THEY ADVISED THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE IT ON THEIR SCOPES EITHER. AFTER THE TARGET WENT OUT OF RANGE, I CONTACTED THE RADAR OFFICER AGAIN AND ASKED HIM TO CHECK HIS TAPES. HE STATED THAT HIS TAPES SHOWED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT MOVING WESTERLY AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 2,200 MPH AND HAD MADE A RIGHT TURN TO ABOUT 165 DEGREES AND IT WAS ADVISED THE PATTERN COULD BE FOLLOWED.
