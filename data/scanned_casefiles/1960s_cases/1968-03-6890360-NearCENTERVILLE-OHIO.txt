At the top of the document, there is a printed header that reads:

"27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE OR EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING."

The rest of the document contains handwritten text, which appears to be a narrative description of a sighting. However, due to the handwritten nature and some parts being slightly illegible, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire text. The writing appears to describe some kind of movement or observation over a period of two to three hours.

The document is marked with "AFR 80-17(C1)" in the top right corner and "PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES" at the bottom right.
