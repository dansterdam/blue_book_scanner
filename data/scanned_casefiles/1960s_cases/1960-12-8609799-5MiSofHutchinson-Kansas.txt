1. DATE
16 Dec 60

2. LOCATION
5 mi N of Hutchinson, Kansas

3. DATE-TIME GROUP
Local 0714
GMT 16/1342

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
[X] Ground-Visual   □ Ground-Radar
□ Air-Visual       □ Air-Intercept Radar

5. PHOTOS
□ Yes
[X] No

6. SOURCE
Military and Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
1-2 sec

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
N-S

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round, bluish-white, pea to egg shape. Sighted 060° above horizon and disappeared at 20° above horizon. Azimuth was 160°.

11. COMMENTS
Duration not long enough for satellite. All observers were driving and observation was reported to be 60°. While driving a car, it is highly improbable that the field of view extends that high. Duration and description are characteristic of meteor. The earth is passing through a number of meteor showers this time of year, and several reports of meteor sightings have been received by the AF. Object was probably one of these meteors.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
[X] Probably Astronomical (meteor)
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation
