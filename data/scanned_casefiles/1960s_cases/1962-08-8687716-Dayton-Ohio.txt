DATE: 5 Aug 1962

At 2045 hrs. 5 Aug 1962, I was watching the southwest sky for the expected appearance of a Bos, whose
vapor trails could be readily seen. Right beside to be another star, but moving toward me.

As it moved thru the sky, almost directly over head, I was satisfied that it was the
Echo satellite, and watched it move toward the NNE. About 35° above the horizon, it began
veering to the right or toward the east and an easterly direction until it faded
from view.
