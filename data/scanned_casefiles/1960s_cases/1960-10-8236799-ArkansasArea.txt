14. Did the object disappear while you were watching? If so, how?
After 30 minutes, altitude maintained

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   (No)   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of or behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   (No)   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape: Noted
b. Color: Grayish-orange-glow

18. We want to know the angular size the object used a match stick at arm's length) in line with a known object and now much of the object would have been covered by the hand. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the hand?
Too far for details, would have been covered by match head without obstruct side

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, protrusion, etc., and especially about width or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

I was thinking that maybe you have heard of such particular sightings and could lessen our fears by telling us that you know.

We would all be greatly honored to hear of any explanation that you might have or theories on this subject.

Very truly yours,

AFOIN-182X

Typed 16 Feb 61

Request for UFO Information (w/ [redacted])

AFOIN-24 (L/Col Tucker)

1. Reference the attached letter to Maj Cox from [redacted] dated 19 November 1960, and newspaper clippings from the Miles City Daily Star, a thorough search of the ATIC UFO case files reveals that no report was made to ATIC of either of the sightings mentioned by [redacted].

2. The information contained in the newspaper account of the sightings by [redacted] on 24 October 1960 indicates that one object viewed by these witnesses was probably the planet Mars. Local meteorological conditions probably contributed to the misidentification. In the absence of reliable data, this conclusion cannot be mechanical official.

3. The account by [redacted] of his sighting on 31 October 1960, closely parallels many others received by ATIC during 1960 following the launching of Zond. A most of the similar cases received by ATIC to date have been satellites. In one case, a high flying aircraft. The unconscious attempt by the witness to put the object at a distance of Zond contributes to the misidentification. This conclusion is an unwarranted due to the absence of reliable data.

THE DEARBORN BALLOON

We have set up the second half of
our story - the official explanation
by the United States Air Force of
what happened that night. The ex-
planation was pending since
August 10 when I had a weekend
with my wife and daughter at our
Lake Winnebago home. Explanation
for NICAP, quizzing and notes that
I was then I December had an-
other visit to the U. S. N. A. at West
Point. Volunteer was the most
recent call that asked to confirm
the new information. He said last
call was after my departure. So now
we take both as correct. I learned that
the U. S. Air Force was preparing
a high altitude weather rocket that
left from Virginia at 9:40 p.m.,
E.S.T., where it climbed over
George Journal into a position with
the atmosphere and became visible.
It was a perfect explanation and
almost with all the facts - except
that the "object" was not a balloon.
More, the time at which we saw it,
its speed, its surface of speed, its
existence for more than three-quar-
ters of an hour, its well-known, color,
and the "facts" showing not to be a
conventional object falling and dis-
appeared, something that the ex-
planation persists, did not agree with
what we saw. "But that
was what anyone had said."
The next morning I started to see
what the newspapers had to offer.
And with increasing joy I found
every paper blasting with headlines
such as "USAF Balloon Startles Mil-
lions" (from The Boston Herald).
From Manchester, N. H. to New
York City they told of how people up
and down the Atlantic coast had
watched the flight of a sphere as
large as a barn sailing silently and
was launched by rocket at 8:50 p.m.
from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Wallops Is-
land at Wallops Island, Virginia.

Other papers carried stories with a
similar pattern of the same event.

And, too, we were relieved
with the amount that the press was
not silent that an object was seen.
In the New York Times and other
papers the object was described as
a bright object, moving across the
sky and falling in an easterly di-
rection.

There was no doubt that
there was a large number of people
who saw something. The question
whether this was a balloon or
something else was that time
bothering the newspapers after
the sighting in Hanover, a num-
ber of Cape residents trying to find
if there was any solid reason
had been a newspaper balloon. The
press began to carry stories of peo-
ple who said there were two objects and
should be sufficiently cooperative for
any reason.

1) To have conclusively estab-
lished the time of our observation.
2. M. S. T. However the watch
of M. S. T. However the watch
entering the calculation did not
ground into the heavens until 8:40
p.m. The balloon itself might not
have been seen until 8:45 p.m. a
suspicion later at that time. In the New
York area, much closer to Virginia
than we, in Hanover, the object
was not seen until shortly before
8:50 p.m. In Boston it was visible
for only ten minutes before it drop-
ped below the horizon.

2) The balloon from Wallops Is-
land, upon reaching an altitude of
200 miles, was being to drift in
an easterly direction for the entire
period. While drifting into the sea. The
balloon was seen from various loca-
tions with a westerly direction, using
a week or ten minutes of visibility.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some words may be slightly inaccurate due to the quality of the scan]

[The text appears to be a detailed report or analysis, with paragraphs discussing some kind of observation or event. The full text is quite long and detailed. I'll reproduce it as accurately as possible.]

The text begins with what seems to be a continuation of a previous discussion, with references to observations, distances, and some kind of aerial phenomenon. There are mentions of locations like New York, discussions of objects being sighted, and references to Air Force activities.

Some key phrases I can clearly make out include:
- "...confirmed the fact. He stated that 27 minutes as most of the 36 minutes elapsed..."
- "...in New York the object acted erratic across the Southern horizon..."
- "...this observation was made..."

The document appears to be a detailed report about some kind of unidentified aerial observation, with technical language and specific details about the event.

The text continues for the full page, with dense paragraphs discussing various aspects of what seems to be a UFO-related incident or observation.

Would you like me to attempt to transcribe the entire text more precisely?

OCT. 29, 1960 CRESSY, LAUNCETON, AUSTRALIA (LORENSEN P 2161 5 WITNESSES)

AT 10:30 P.M., J. METCALFE, WATCHING TELEVISION AT THE TIME, SAID HE FELT A PECULIAR SENSATION OF "AIRLESSNESS" JUST BEFORE THE EXPLOSION, KTHE WINDOWS FOUNDATION -- BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE EXPLOSION*. HE SAID, METCALFE WENT OUTSIDE WHERE HE AND MRS. J. SALTMARSH OBSERVED A FADING RED GLOW TO THE NORTHEAST. MR. AND MRS. T. WOODWARD SAW AN ORANGE-COLORED BALL HOVERING ABOVE WESTERN TIERS, A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF BOATINA AT THE POSITION OUT SWELLED, AND SHRANK IN SIZE. "MY WIFE AND I WATCHED IT FOR A MINUTE AND A HALF OR A LITTLE LONGER. THEN IT SEEMED TO GO OUT RATHER THAN MOVE AWAY. I WOULD SUGGEST IT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE TIERS." WOODWARD STATED, WAS SOON AS IT DISAPPEARED HE BOTH FELT A MOST PECULIAR SENSATION, AS IF THERE WAS PRESSURE ALL AROUND THEM. THEN CAME THE TERRIFIC AREA AND THE ORANGE BALL WAS ITS EXHAUST, BUT HE PHONED THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION AT LAUNCETON AIRPORT AND RECEIVED A NEGATIVE ANSWER.

J. D. ROBSON WHO ALSO REPORTED HEARING AND FEELING THE EXPLOSION, HAD SIGHTING ON OCTOBER 31 ALSO AT CRESSY (G.W.)

Dear Mr. Humphrey:

You must have been reading Keyhoe - some of the flying saucer magazines. The opinions I express are my own. I am not beholden to the Air Force or to anyone. I have had access to the official files, but as my request. There is nothing in the files to suggest your contention nor the conclusion of others that there are such things as non-terrestrial UFO's.

Sincerely yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director

CC: Major Coleman

Do you have anything in your files that relates to the reported sighting?

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Round object, dark color, 30 degrees above horizon, viewed at azimuth 268° at an estimated distance of 75 miles. The object was estimated to be five times larger than Venus.

EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: Balloon
CONCLUSION:
This object was determined to be a balloon by a B-47 which accompanied an intercept at 32,000 feet. The incident was illuminated by the setting sun, which was also responsible for the coloration.

Dr. Lowell S. Benson, Director
Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory
Annapolis, Washington

October 3, 1963

Dear Dr. Benson:

For years I have followed your scientific publications with great interest, particularly those on flying saucers. On August 28, 1963, I was discussing your publications and their relationship to the purely technical aspects of official basic studies in the field of extra-terrestrial vehicles with some colleagues.

It is logical to assume that if you have some official files concerning these vehicles, you also know that they are not merely a matter of hallucinations or beliefs but can be considered as a matter of scientific observation. Dr. Benson, that you will certainly do the right thing and share from your own point of view the details of this matter. I must both cite the official sources and suppose that such a decisive extract is truly worthy to increase the weight of the problem, perhaps only with a brief and valid point of view.

If you are interested, please send me the accompanying article which was published in the New York Times. The picture of these publications, the particular details, this would be a stimulating way of adding some new points to the vehicles. It was approximately 1257 feet in length, with a clearance of close to 20 feet. The vehicle was of high performance with continuously 10 miles. So I primarily would like to know from Hamilton Electronics and Flight Missiles some details about this field.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

For persons thinking UFOs were only sightings of Echo, note the following sightings. On November 1, 1960 6 UFOs, three of them traveling in the same direction, were reported by 13 persons at Green's City, Colorado. The objects were described by TAL employee as being "brighter, more brilliant than Echo, America's communications satellite". Those sightings were reported to the Air Defense Command in Washington, D.C.

I was sitting in the front porch of my home, as I gazed, noticing the sky and checking this position. We then waited for quite a few moments.

Pegasus was slow and bright in the northern sky while suddenly, I saw a bright star exactly in the middle of this square within where so as bright. It was bright then "MERATZ". I looked close my binoculars and the atmosphere into an oval nebulous glow or coverage in color. There was a darker glow toward the lower third. I watched for some distance and also saw it. Lights about 10 minutes at most close to just as Echo was now, nearly and just as then we are alright coming to a point in Pegasus below Vega. It stayed at that.

minutes below the town station in
Centerville and then returned to
another place we first saw it appear.
It was almost stationary for a few minutes
then moved to nearby and disappeared
in a few seconds. According to the clock
the whole time covered 3-5 minutes.
I was told by the Airport office that

On November 11 at Moline, Iowa, large silver object with an antenna protruding from one side was reported by Moline Airport weather observers. Two hours later, a UFO was sighted at Rockford, Illinois, and also traced by radar at Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, and Des Moines, Iowa. On this same date, at Manchester, England a cigar-shaped object trailing sparks was seen by many witnesses, including British Army Capt. [redacted]. Stating he had "never seen anything like it before," the captain said a brilliant flash momentarily blinded him, then he saw the UFO speeding away.

A BRILLIANT NOVEMBER AURORA

A record of the morning of November 8th was sent in by George A. Cline, Wichita, Kansas; J. M. Darby, Hutchinson, Texas; C. W. Shults, III, Carthage, Missouri; and members of Our Lady's Astronomers Club in Carthage, Missouri.

The aurora was watched by Howard Tarkington, Oakley, Kansas, from 5:20 p.m. CST, and he total duration over several hours was over 2 hours. Other Astronomers in Sedgefield, Ohio, who also photographed the event, found the aurora extending from the northwest to southeast, Wisconsin to Texas. He observed the spectacular lines of neutral oxygen.

Later the aurora was north of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts, and extended across the sky at 7:39 EST on a line from Maine to New Jersey. Many observers noted a strong green hue in the northern sky and a reddish tinge near the southern border that extended all across town.

A Paterson, New Jersey, the Newton Jet Astronomical Center briefly noted during dusk, and by 7:39 EST was at its height. Many observers of extreme northern latitudes noted that was a strong green hue in the northern sky and reddish tinge near the southern border that extended all across town.

Main observers commented on the red dark red for aurora. Worthy, Proctor, Virginia. The coloring was also noted by J. R. Chenoweth, Greeley, Colorado; Mr. J. W. Sparks, St. Augustine, Florida; J. Hills, Independence, Kansas; N. Wright, Massachusetts. Dale Schubert used an f/2.8 lens and Panatomic-X film to record this bright aurora of the morning of November 8th in this exposure.

Dear Sir,

My name is [redacted] I am 17 years old, and I am writing you because I am writing to see if you could help me out or give me a logical explanation for probably the strangest possible phenomena.

One November day last year just before a large snowstorm hit our area, I was walking outside by home and at about 6 p.m. (MST) I was walking down the road in front of my house, my friend looked up and said "Isn't that beautiful." As I looked up I saw a strange object about 50 feet in diameter hovering over my roof. This was a perfectly round object. This object was dimly glowing and didn't appear to be a solid. It had no definite border. By that I mean I had no definite ending of shape. It was only about 15 to 20 feet off the ground and as its end. The edges were blurred, although the entire object was almost entirely round. As we looked at it, it was approximately 50 feet in diameter. At first it was just hovering, then it started coming down on us at a slow speed. As it came down, it moved almost 15 feet in diameter. The closest it ever came to us was about a few inches over our heads. At this point we weren't even scared in a hysterical way, and we both can hysterically to my house door step.

Well, practically, but my parents were at the other end of the house no they didn't see us come running. Meantime this object came down almost level to the ground and just stood there about 30 feet from us. I made a frantic attempt to get away by running around the other end of the house to our kitchen entrance where my parents were having dinner. As I was about to enter the kitchen door, I heard my friend scream terribly. (She said later that she was scared.) She ran at the front door, not wanting to take the chance of running back. The time from that moment to the front door was about 15 to 20 seconds. She told me that she went out the door step and what she saw is that it went up a little way into the sky, until it became about the size of the moon or a little smaller. Then she said it changed color to a yellow white and started down at her at extreme velocity. As it came down again, it was about 15 feet in diameter.

As we both were very scared we told my parents the story, and they both laughed at us and told us that we were dreaming. That was the first sighting.


- page 47 -

About two months ago (I don't remember the exact date), after the first sighting, my Father (Mr [redacted], and son) was going to visit a gentleman in Rockville, Md. We were right off of exit 3 on the Rockville Park way parallel to which goes to Danbury, Conn. It was about 7 p.m. (I bear after we lost on the other road and couldn't find the proper turn out and looked up a few hundred yards and there would be the turn off. My wife was to get out of the car and guide him for a U turn. We got out and looked in back of the car, for a moment I got terribly scared and saw the same object, which my friend and I saw about a year ago was about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away. At that point I didn't know what it had. It had that same orange-red color. At that point I didn't know whether to run back into our car so fast that my father thought I was crazy or just stand there. We were both standing there petrified at first, but not as long looking at it. Our fears were somewhat eased because it was standing on a middle and didn't do a thing. We both were standing there for at least 10 minutes studying the situation. My father not being as close as I was started to approach it. He got within about 10 feet of it and then just stood there for a few seconds and then came back to our car. At first he wasn't sure what to say, but then he said "It is probably a phenomenon that happens once in a while which is unexplainable. We determined then the car and the road we were on, for a few hundred yards and make the proper turn off the road. This would mean that I would go back up right under this thing. First I hesitated but then I passed under it and then passed behind it, it was a very tense moment for us. As we looked up after it had passed it, there was no trace of the object left. This was the last we saw of it.

Description of Object Seen:
1. No noise from object.
2. No mass or any objects came from it.
3. In the first sighting, it had the capability to change colors.
4. Varied from about 3 to 15 feet in diameter in the first sighting.
5. It definitely was dimly glowing.
6. It had no definite shape, or edges to it.
7. It was almost perfectly round.
8. It didn't appear to be a solid, but rather a form of gas.
9. At the first sighting it had the capability to move in any direction.
10. Last speed.

Dear Sir, it is our hope that you look into this and possibly give us a logical explanation for these sightings. The thought of keeping it secret and to me, many nights, and it has kept my mind in a complete fog about what it could be.

Here is the text from the document:

I was thinking that maybe you have heard of such particular sightings and could lessen our fears by telling us that you know.

We would all be greatly honored to hear of any explanation that you might have or theories on this subject.

Very truly yours,

ORIONIS METEORS IN 1960

SINCE becoming a member of the American Meteor Society two years, I have observed over 1,200 meteors visually and have photographed about 25 bright ones on fewer than 200 exposures.

On October 20-21, 1960, our small group of observers at Tujunga, California, made visual and photographic observations of the Orionis meteors between 1:30 and 2:30 a.m. Pacific standard time.

I took 16 photographs with a 35mm. Nikkor camera, whose 36 mm. lens covered a 60 degree field. Two meteors were flashed, both nearly visually as being bright than 1st magnitude and leaving trains.

The following night, 16 more exposures gave images of three additional meteors. Another observer counted 27 and 47 meteors in the one-hour intervals starting at 1:30 and 2:30 a.m., respectively.

On both nights, sky conditions were ideal, with no interference from city lights. The temperature never dropped below a fairly comfortable 62°.

NORMAN D. PETERSEN
1656 Valmont St.
Tujunga, Calif.

An Orionis meteor of visual magnitude zero recorded on Tel X 1.5 by Norman D. Petersen. He began the exposure at 2:56 a.m. Pacific standard time. October 21, 1960, and closed the shutter a minute after the meteor appeared at 2:57 1/2 a.m.

Traveling toward Leo between Cancer and Hydra, the Orionis meteor had a feebledegree trail, was orange, and left a train that persisted for 20 seconds.

Request for UFO Information (w/ [redacted])

AFOIN-24 (L/Col Tucker):

1. Reference the attached letter to Maj Cox from [redacted] dated 19 November 1960, and newspaper clippings from the Miles City Daily Star, a thorough search of the ATIC UFO case files reveals that no report was made to ATIC of either of the sightings mentioned by [redacted].

2. The information contained in the newspaper account of the sightings by [redacted] on 24 October 1960 indicates that one object viewed by these witnesses was probably the planet Mars. Local meteorological conditions probably contributed to the misidentification. In the absence of reliable data, this conclusion cannot be mechanical official.

3. The account by [redacted] of his sighting on 31 October 1960, closely parallels many others received by ATIC during 1960 following the launching of Zond. A most of the similar cases received by ATIC to date have been satellites. In one case, a high flying aircraft. The unconscious attempt by the witness to put the object at a distance of Zond contributes to the misidentification. This conclusion is an unwarranted unofficial due to the absence of reliable data.
