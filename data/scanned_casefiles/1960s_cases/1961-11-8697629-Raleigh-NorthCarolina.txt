Dec 17 - 1961

To the accompanying sketch is, to the best of my
outside ability, what [blacked out] a sophomore at Campbell
N.C. State College, a student at Trent Campbelle
College and I saw in the sky.

We were observing Jupiter in my telescope -
we looked in the direction of Pleiades for
another possible telescope object, when this
object appeared in our view from about a tree
about 30° to the vertical - moving very nearly south -
where it went out of view over trees about
60° to the vertical. - Time elapsed about
three or four seconds.

The air was very clear - No moon -
no clouds in any direction - Temperature
about 60° - very comfortable - for staying out
with my telescope - time around 10:00 P.M. - 17 Nov 61,
we could see clearly the outline of a plane that passed
about 20 minutes later -

We could not see any outline of my object - only the
lights. They were in the center of the lighted area
(see sketch) and appeared nothing were shining
through translucent glass - all three were the same
color - greenish yellow - Absolutely No Sound
accompanied this phenomenon -
they seemed to move as a unit.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Lights observed. Compared to Pleiades. approx. size of position

At the bottom right, there is also text that appears to read:
Raleigh NC

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram of some observed lights, with multiple circular and radiant light-like shapes, compass directions (N, S), and an arrow indicating motion or orientation.
