14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   (No)   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - NONE
b. Color - METAL - CALLS IT THEN TO GLEAM

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

KEYWORDS: I ESTIMATED EACH OBJECT TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE YARD ON RULER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. SINCE THEN I HELD A RULER AT A KNOWN DISTANCE AND FOUND THAT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE COVERED THAT. SO I WAS AT ERROR IN THAT ESTIMATE. THE MATCH HEAD COMPARISON COVERED ABOUT 1/2 OF THE OBJECT. PERHAPS SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE BODY OF A NEARBY OBJECT. THEY WERE PERHAPS SO PROBABLY TRUE MATCH HEAD WOULD HAVE COVERED HALF OF ONE OBJECT.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shapes of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wing, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire - a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I WAS SITTING ON MY BACK PORCH. THERE ARE TREES ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS YARD. PERMITTING AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THE SKY. ONE HOUSE FACES NORTH - PORCH ON SOUTH SIDE. I WAS FACING SOUTH.

SUDDENLY BIRDS CAME FLYING OVERHEAD FROM THE NORTH. THEY SEEMED EXCITED AND DISTURBED ABOUT SOMETHING. I LOOKED UP AT THE SKY AND THERE WERE GLEAMING OBJECTS, ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE ME. THEY WERE GLEAMING WHERE THE SUNS RAYS - NOT DIRECTLY.

I COULD SEE THEM DISTINCTLY + WERE TOOK MY EYES OFF THEM. UNTIL THEN THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE DISTANCE - TWO TINY BLACK SPECKS STILL IN PERFECT FORMATION.

THEY WERE NOT DRIFTING, BUT SWAYING, BUT FLYING IN A STRAIGHT COURSE AND WERE DEFINITELY BEING GUIDED SKILLFULLY. THEY WERE FLYING SWIFTLY + SILENTLY.

I TALKED WITH A FELLOW WEATHER BUREAU - THE BALLOON THEY SEND UP ARE - ONE LARGE SILVER BALLOON WITH A TAIL ON THE END OF WHICH IS A SMALLER BALLOON IN A STIFF WIND. THE THESE OBJECTS WERE GOING DOWN TO THE REAR OF THE LARGER ONE, SHAPED, WERE FLYING SIDE BY SIDE IN A STRAIGHT, UNWAVERING COURSE, FROM A POINT TO SOUTH, OR FOLLOWING THE HUDSON RIVER.

THEY WERE STRANGE + WHEN SOMEONE IN AUTHORITY SHOULD BE NOTIFIED, I THOUGHT I MAY ATTENTION. TO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO TELL THEM. THE COMMANDING OFFICER AT THE WATERJET ARSENAL TOLD SOMEONE TO TELL ME THAT IT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

AS CLEARLY + DISTINCTLY AS I CAN SEE THOSE THINGS BEFORE IN THE SKY, I AM SURE ONE OF THEM I WROTE THAT I RECEIVED HERE BURNED ME UP, AND I THAT I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM NICK. WAS WITH PATRICK + INFORMATION COULD KNOW, ETC.

I STILL DO NOT BELIEVE IN OBJECTS FROM OTHER PLANETS OR FROM OTHER PLANES.

Here is the text from the document:

Page 8

I STILL BELIEVE THESE OBJECTS COULD BE HIGH POWERED, REMOTE CONTROLLED CARRIERS LAUNCHED FROM A SHIP AT SEA.

WE ARE FOREVER HEARING REPORTS THAT SEVERAL RUSSIAN SHIPS HAVE BEEN SIGHTED, ANCHORED OFF THE EASTERN COAST OF THE U.S.A.

THERE ARE MANY VITAL GOVERNMENT INSTALLATIONS IN THIS AREA. I DON'T BELIEVE THESE OBJECTS WILL BE WHAT THEY WANT. I FEEL SOMETHING STRANGE THAT MUST BE INVESTIGATED.

THEY ARE SEEING MISSILES OUR OWN GOVERNMENT IS TESTING - THEN I DESERVE SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION IF THEY ARE NOT OURS, THEN THE U.S.A.F. HAD BETTER GET IT TOGETHER. I HAVE NOT EXPLAINED EVERY THING CLEARLY ENOUGH SO IF THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS YOU WOULD LIKE ANSWERED I COULD BE OF HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN.

I APOLOGIZE HEARING SOMETHING ABOUT THESE HAPPENINGS OF IMAGINATION - BUT BELIEVE ME, THESE THINGS I CAN SEE ARE VERY REAL.

MENANDS IS A SMALL VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT TWO (2) MILES NORTH OF ALBANY, NEW YORK.

YOU MAY USE MY NAME, IF IT WILL HELP IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THE ORIGIN OF THESE OBJECTS.

Dear Sir;

I have never believed in the reports of flying saucers nor of other unidentified Flying Objects,claimed sighted by various people at different times and in different localities. The supposition that these objects were piloted by little green men from outer space, in my mind was pure balony and still is.

On August 11th past-at about 7:25 P.M.I was sitting on my back porch watching birds flying around, when two gleaming silver objects came into view over the roof of my porch. I have extremely good eyesight and am not an excitable person and I certainly was not hopefully looking for something strange to fly past in my line of vision.

These objects were flying quite low, made absolutely no noise, no smoke and were not spinning. One dipped slightly, then jerked back into position, as though pulled by a string. They were flying from North to South- following the Hudson River. I watched them until they became two little black specks in the distance.

They were not round- they were not flat as saucers. The sky was bright and clear and I got a good thorough look at them. They were not optical illusions-not mirages and not jittery dreams of my own imagination. They were real!

Could they not have been two high powered, remote controlled camera's launched from a ship at sea?

No one in authority will listen to my description of them. I have been told "They do not exist." That they were an optical illusion. Well--I know better--I saw them. They do exist!

Our government is spending Billions of Dollars, trying to put men on the moon before the Russians do--while the Russians could be spending their money taking pictures of our entire country.

If there was just a telephone number we could call when these things are sighted, then stations in the directions they are going

Menands, New York
11 Aug 65

On August 11th, at 7:23 p.m., an unnamed woman living in Menands, N.Y. made a close observation of two gleaming silver objects. A sketch made from her description was published in an Albany newspaper. She said they made no noise, emitted no smoke, and were at very low altitude, moving southward at high speed. Each was five or six feet across, according to her estimate.

could be alerted. Then people in authority would definitely spot them. No
one will listen to a mere housewife sitting on her back porch watching birds
flying around.

Most Americans keep their eyes glued to T.V. or to the road. It is only
the squares that ever look up. But squares can be patriotic and concerned
about the security of their country, also. It is a mighty smug and careless
government that will not be concerned and alarmed at all these reports.
These Champagne sipping, high and mighty men in charge of our security,
that think they know it all, merely pass these reports off as crackpot.
Someday and maybe not too far in the future, when the Champagne
glasses are knocked out of their hands and it is already too late, they
will say, "We should have listened and we should have believed."
They are depending on Radar to pick up all these things. Did the
mighty minds ever stop to think, other countries know about Radar, too?
Maybe, know how to get missiles past or fly them too low, or other methods?
I am writing this letter because I am thoroughly burned up. After I
reported sighting these objects- an announcement was made on our local
Television station to this effect, "There have been reports that silver
flying objects were sighted in this area. After careful investigation by
authorities, this conclusion was reached--No such objects exist." By the
time anyone got around to investigating these reports, the objects in
question were gone.

I drew pictures of what I saw. If anyone is interested in seeing
them and hearing my description, (and believe me, someone should be) I will
be glad to show them and explain what I saw.
And Believe Me, I saw them!!
