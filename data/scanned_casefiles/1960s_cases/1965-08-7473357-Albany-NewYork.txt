The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows a side view of an object with a cylindrical shape and what appears to be some protrusions or other details. The sketch is accompanied by a series of questions and answers related to the observation of the object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
NO

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No)   Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of or anything at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (No)   Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: BUZZING
b. Color: METAL - STAINLESS STEEL TYPE - GRAYISH

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had trouble with this experiment or the object was otherwise too distant, estimate the apparent size.
Appears to be about 10 feet in diameter and about 25 feet long. The light was very bright and seemed to pulsate and swish downward about 10 feet and then back up about 10 feet, in a rhythmic motion, like a heart beat. The object seemed to be slightly tilted with the bottom end farther away from the observer.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, proturberances, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please aim your drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image contains a sketch/diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows an illustration with compass directions and instructions on how to depict the motion of an observed object or objects, including their direction and any changes in direction during the course of the observation.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass where you last saw it.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN UFO'S RESEARCH AT WORKING SITE - NEAR ALBANY NY FOR SOME TIME, AND HAVE SEEN SEVERAL (CANNOT DETERMINE EXACT NUMBER) UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. THESE OBJECTS WERE GENERALLY OVAL OR CIGAR-SHAPED, WITH SOME LUMINOUS MARKINGS. THEY MOVED RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY, AT LOW ALTITUDES. ONE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY 1957. THE OTHERS WERE WITHIN THE PAST 5 YEARS. I HAVE REPORTED SOME OF THESE SIGHTINGS TO THE PRESS, BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PUBLIC INTEREST. I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN ANY FOLLOW-UP ON THIS REPORT, AND IN ANY INFORMATION YOUR PROJECT CAN PROVIDE.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8-7-65 Year 1965

33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the investigation is presented here.
THERE VIERE 7/TO OR HZ VEHICLES WHICH 711VERT1 VERY LOW, ABOUT 15 FT OFF THE GROUND, CIRCLING TIT? AREA. THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 30 FT IN DIAMETER AND DISC SHAPED, LIGHT GRAY IN COLOR. THEY MADE NO NOISE AND NO VISIBLE EXHAUST.
THEY SEEMED TO MANEUVER, APPROACHING AND GOING STRAIGHT UP, RATHER THAN LEAVING HORIZON7ALLY. I LOOKED AT THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES AND DECIDED TO NOTIFY STATE POLICE WHO CAME OUT.
THEY INVESTIGATED AND CALLED IN THE NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE, BUT I LATER LEARNED NOTHING WAS EVER FOUND ON RADAR. THE STATE POLICE HAD CALLED THE AIR FORCE BASE BEFORE I ARRIVED, BUT THEY COULD NOT LOCATE ANYTHING. I BELIEVE THESE OBJECTS WERE REAL AND POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS CRAFT EMITTING NO VISIBLE EXHAUST AND MANEUVERING IN A MOST UNUSUAL FASHION.

Dear Sir:

I have never believed in the reports of flying saucers nor of other unidentified Flying Objects, claimed sighted by various people at different times and in different localities. The supposition that these objects were piloted by little green men from outer space, in my mind has always been absurd.

On August 11th past-at about 7:25 P.M. I was sitting on my back porch watching birds flying around, when two gleaning silver objects came slowly over the tops of my trees. I have extremely good eyesight and am not an excitable person and I certainly was not frightened for a second for seeing them.

These objects were flying quite low, made absolutely no noise, no smoke and were not gliding. They dipped back into position, as though pulled by a string. They were flying from north to south following the shadow silvers. I watched them until they became two little black specks in the distance.

They were not round-they were not flat as saucers.
The sky was bright and clear and I got a good thorough look at them. They were not optical illusions-not mirages and not jittery from some of own distortions. They were completely real.

Could they not have been two high powered, remote controlled camera's launched from a ship? No one in authority will listen to my description of them. I have been "ridiculed" unmercifully for making an honest sighting. Well-I know better-I saw them. They do exist! 

The government is spending millions of dollars, trying to hit men on the moon before the Russians do-while the Russians could be spending their money taking pictures of our entire country. If there was nothing in the skies, then stations in the directions they are going. when these things are sighted, then perhaps explanations could be given when sightings happen.

Sincerely,

No Case:
Information only
Date: 65 Report: VUL. 12, No. 4 Loananda, New York
11 Aug. 64

On August 0, 1965 at approximately 9:15 p.m. while observing the night sky, a witness living in Loananda, NY made a sighting of several silvery objects. A sketch made from the observation was submitted to the UFO newspaper. She said they made no noise, and were at very low altitude, moving southward at high speed. Each was five or six feet across, according to her estimate.

Text extracted from the document:

Could be alerted. Then people in authority would definitely spot them. No one will listen to a mere housewife arguing on her back porch watching flying saucers. These Americans keep this all quiet as near the squares that ever look up. But squares can be patriotic and concerned about the security of their country. Also, it is a mighty snug and careless procedure to just build up charges to all these reports. These champions sipping, high and mighty men in charge of our security, that think they know it all, never to give one peep out of us raucous common riff-raff. Someday and maybe not so far in the future, when the Champagne glasses are shaken out, this will all be seen as it is already too late. They will say, "We should have listened and we should have believed."

They are depending on Reader to patch up all these things. Did the mighty minds ever stop to think, other countries know about Radar too? Maybe, know how to get missiles past or fly them too. Low, or other methods? If an attacking world leader becomes I am thoroughly burned up. After I reported sighting these objects - an announcement was made on our local television station to the effect that these flying objects were sighted in this area. After careful investigation by military, this conclusion was reached. "By the time anyone got around to investigating these reports, the objects in question were gone."

I drew pictures of what I saw. If anyone is interested in seeing them and hearing my description, (and believe me, someone should be), I will be glad to show them and explain what I saw. And Believe Me, I saw them!
