11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness first observed one light, later one white light and a flashing red and green lights. Observer said the object appeared low and it seemed to be circling. The golf course; also thought guards at Monsanto would have seen object. Additional data necessary so AF Form 117 was sent to witness.

COMMENTS: Contacted FAA, etc; a plane could have been in area without a flight plan. Contacted Monsanto plant and some of the guards. No unusual sightings. Object does not appear to be a small aircraft. However, there is not sufficient data since witness did not return AF Form 117.

Subj:   UFO Observation, 19 Mar 1968

Location: Miamisburg, Ohio

DURATION:   About 20 Minutes

TIME:        4 to 4:15 am, 19 March 1968

PLACE:       Miamisburg (Over Monsanto and Golf Course)

NOISE:       None
DESCRIPTION: At first one light, later one white light and a flashing
             red and green light.

HEIGHT:      Felt that it was low. It seemed to be circling the Golf
             course. "Thinks that the guards at Monsanto would have
             had to have seen the object since it was right over them.

Lt Parsons called Base FAA 19 Mar:   Was informed that it could have
been one of our base helicopters on VFR but there is no way for the
tower to really say. Unless it acted really strangely the controller
would assume it to be a small plane on VFR. Suggested I contact the
helicopter service at Vandalia.

Called Skyway Inc, 833-4615 and Dayton Helicopter Service 224-1451.
Neither had helicopters out at 4 a.m. Also called Souther Ohio
Aviation Co 866-2427. They stated that there could have been a
light plane out of the field but they wouldn't have record of it.

Called the Monsanto Plant at Miamisburg 866-7444. None of the guards
reported seeing anything unusual for the 12:00 to 8 am shift.
