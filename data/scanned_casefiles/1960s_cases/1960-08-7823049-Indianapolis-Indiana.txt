Subject spoke of "UFO" as something from outer space without actually saying so. He spoke several times of a look on UFO's, and seemed to want to believe what he had read, as if this were living proof. Subject had called the Weather Bureau at Indianapolis and said "they told me what they thought it was" in a manner that indicated he believed the W.B. answer to be totally incorrect, and not most explaining. Subject worked for a Chevrolet dealer in Indianapolis. He appeared to enjoy the interview. Some answers were too vague to include in the sighting report.
