11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted elliptical shaped object with a glass bubble protruding from the top. The object was silvery gray in color and appeared to hover before departing toward the northwest. The observer said he could hear a low pitched whine at one time.

There was evidence present in the form of depressions in the ground. The surrounding area showed no effects of heat and no evidence of high velocity wind blast. One of the investigating officials said it looked like someone had jumped up and down on a bowling ball.

Combat Support Squadron, from Mr. Clifford Melroe of the Melroe Manu-
facturing Company of Gwinner, North Dakota, that a strange object had
been observed near Gwinner by a schoolboy, and that the object, upon landing near the farm home of the boy, had left tracks

in the field. He suggested that someone be sent out to observe the tracks and possibly explain them.

At 2130Z, Brig Gen Homer G. Goebel, Lt Col Thomas E. Marking, Capt Edward A. Skroch and MSgt Everett E. Brust arrived at the scene of the reported sighting. At the point where the observer said the object landed, three (3) impressions were found in a summerfalfowed field. The impressions were ball-shaped, 10" in diameter and 7" deep, in the form of an isosceles triangle, 26'x21'6"x21'6". They were apparently made by an object or objects pressed vertically. There was no evidence of digging and the impressions were compacted solidly. It is estimated from the condition of the soil that approximately 1500 lbs would be required to make each one. There was evidence of pedestrian traffic but no vehicular tracks were seen entering the field. The dried stubble in the area showed no effects of heat and no evidence of high velocity wind blast was apparent. Radiation at the site was insignificant indicating .1 milliroentgen on PDR-27. No electrical transmission lines are located in the area.

The information in a through e. above was obtained through an interview with the observer. The impression gained from the interview was that the boy is very level-headed and objective for his age. Although he admitted being frightened at the time, his story did not vary in any detail during the interview. When asked to make a drawing of what he saw, he did so without hesitation or apparent doubt about what he thought he observed.

Although the possibility of a hoax always exists, it is not considered a certainty. The observer obviously lacks observation experience and technical knowledge but he displayed obvious sincerity. The impressions could have been made by individuals, but the instrument used would have been quite heavy and required two or more to carry it. The number of persons having knowledge of the alleged sighting was limited prior to 15 September since the boy was reluctant to mention it to anyone except his mother.

The possibility that some ball lightning phenomenon was observed is not considered valid since, according to meteorological texts, weather conditions were not correct, i.e., no active thunderstorms, wind velocity too high, etc. A whirlwind or "dust devil" must be ruled out since the ground was damp and the air was stable as evidenced by the probable temperature-dew point spread. According to the U. S. Weather Station, the cold front at this time was east of Fargo, south of Gwinner, but north of Aberdeen.

If one assumes a relationship between the sighting and the impressions in the field, then any meteorological phenomenon must be discounted.

- page 8 -

No aircraft, experimental or operational, is known at this station which would account for such impressions that were left in the field or, assuming the observer's story to be valid, would account for the flight path or appearance.

The possibility exists that the impressions could have been made by repeated pounding and sculpturing with a round object and the sighting invented to go with them or that the sighting was reported and the impressions then sculptured to give it credibility. To prove or disprove this would probably require intensive interrogation.

If no connection between the sighting and the impressions is assumed then the sighting could have been an optical illusion or some unknown atmospheric anomaly. However, based on the assumption that the reported sighting was reasonably valid, that a causal relationship exists between the sighting and the ground impressions and that hoax or some sort was not involved, the object reported is considered known and unidentified pending further information that may become available.

ATTN OF: PDFM/R. J. Parker/55027                                   26 October 1966

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Depressions Found in Fallowed Field Near Gwinner,
         North Dakota in Connection with Reported UFO Sighting

TO: PDFDR/Lt. Morley

Conclusions:

1. The symmetrical layout of the depressions is a logical arrange-
   ment for a tripod-type landing gear.

2. The absence of vehicular tracks in the field effectively rules
   out the possibility of the depressions being made by a piece of
   heavy farm equipment.

3. Since no soil strength data was obtained, it is not possible
   to estimate the force which made the depressions. (A cone penetrom-
   eter reading in the area surrounding the depressions plus additional
   readings in the bottom of the depressions themselves are essential.)
   Therefore, it is not possible to verify the estimated 1500 lbs force
   per depression figure given by the investigator's report.

4. Based on the information contained in the report made by Brig.
   Gen. Homer G. Goebel, NDakANG, there is no evidence to refute that
   the depressions could have been made by a vehicle with vertical
   take-off and landing capability. The rounded shape of the imprints
   would normally by associated as the ground-contacting elements for
   a landing gear designed for unsurfaced (relatively soft) areas.
   Self-aligning flat-bottom pads would be a more logical selection
   for landing on prepared sites.

Conversation with MSgt Brust, one of the investigating officials, revealed that the ground was compressed but not solidly compressed as first stated. The markings were three days old before the investigating group arrived on the scene. He made the comment that it looked to him like someone had taken a bowl- ing ball and jumped on it several times. No additional information had become available on this sighting. They had submitted all the information that they had obtained.

The Air Force Office which has the responsibility for investigating unidentified flying objects is in receipt of a report from the Gwinner area on 13 September 1966. The initial report mentioned that electrical power was off in the immediate area for approximately four hours. This office would appreciate any information on the cause or causes of this particular electrical power breakdown. This information will be of value in our final evaluation of the reported sighting. If you have any questions on the material desired you may contact Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr at area code 513, 25-70916
