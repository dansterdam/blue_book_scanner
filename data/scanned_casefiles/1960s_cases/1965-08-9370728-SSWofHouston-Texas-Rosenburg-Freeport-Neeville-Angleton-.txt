UNITS COULD SEE IT. THE TOWNS MENTIONED ABOVE ALL REPORTED THE
SAME OBJECT IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA. THE REPORT WAS CALLED IN
PAGE 2 RUNGJU 11 UNCLAS
TO THIS BASE BY OFFICER JOHN W. WERCHAN OF THE TEXAS HIGHWAY
PATROL (HOUST ON OX4-135 1). THREE OTHER REPORTS OF SIMILAR SITTINGS
WERE RECEIVED BY SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS IN THE HOUSTON METROPOLITAN
AREA WITHIN A PERIOD OF THREE HOURS PRIOR TO THE SITTINGS BY THE
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. 3. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ROUND AND ABOUT
THE SIZE OF A DIME. IT ALTERNATELY HAD A BRILLIANT AND DULL GLOW
WITH COLORS OF RED, GREEN, WHITE. ONLY ONE OBJECT WAS SEEN; THE
BOTTOM OF WHICH SEEMED TO BE ROTATING GIVING OFF PREDOMINANTLY
A RED GLOW AND ALTERNATING TO GREEN AND WHITE. NO OTHER UNUSUAL
FEATURES WERE NOTED. THERE WAS NO SOUND, TRAIL, OR EXHAUST.
SHERIFF BALIS' ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE OBJECT BY ITS
BRIGHTNESS. IT WAS AT A FORTY DEGREE ANGLE OF ELEVATION SOUTHEAST
OF HIS POSITION. IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE HIGH, ABOVE TEN
THOUSAND FEET. THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE EXCEPT UP AND DOWN. IT
REMAINED VISIBLE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN THE OFFICER'S DUTIES
REQUIRED HIM TO DISCONTINUE WATCHING IT. THE OFFICER WATCHED IT

THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT SOMETHING WAS SEEN; HOWEVER, THE
PRESENCE OF INVERSION CONDITIONS, THE FACT THAT OBJECT REMAINED
IN ONE LOCATION FOR OVER AN HOUR, AND THAT SIMILAR SITINGS WERE
OBSERVED IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE AREA CAUSES ME TO SUSPECT THE

SITINGS WERE CAUSED BY SURFACE LIGHTS BEING REFLECTED OFF THE

1. UFO Report submitted IAW paragraph 14, AFR 200-2. 2. The following object was observed by members of the police/sheriff departments of the following Texas towns: Rosenberg, Freeport, Needville, and Angleton. Towns are located south and southwest of Houston. The first person to observe the object was Sheriff Balis of the Fort Bend Sheriff's Office (Richmond MC2-3724). He broadcasted the siting over the radio and asked if any other units could see it. The towns mentioned above all reported the same object in the same general area. The report was called in to this base by Officer John W. Merchan of the Texas Highway Patrol (Houston OX4-1351). Three other reports of similar sitings

were received by separate individuals in the Houston metropolitan area within a period of three hours prior to the sittings by the law enforcement officers. 3. Object appeared to be round and about the size of a dime. It alternately had a brilliant and dull glow with colors of red, green, white. Only one object was seen; the bottom of which seemed to be rotating giving off predominantly a red glow and alternating to green and white. No other unusual features were noted. There was no sound, trail, or exhaust.

Sheriff Balls' attention was directed to the object by its brightness. It was at a forty degrees angle of elevation southeast of his position. It appeared to be quite high, above ten thousand feet. The object did not move except up and down. It remained visible for about an hour and then the officer's duties required him to discontinue watching it. The officer watched it with both naked eye and binoculars. Object was sited initially at 1000% 26 AUG 65 under clear night time conditions. The following weather conditions were noted during the time of sighting: Winds - surface, calm; 6000 ft/variable; 10,000 ft, variable; 16,000 ft, 60 degrees at five knots; 20,000 ft, variable at 5 knots; 30,000 ft, variable at five knots; above 30,000 ft, not available. Temperatures: surface, 72°; 6000 ft, 15°; 10,000 ft, 9°; 16,000 ft, 2°; 20,000 ft, minus 9°; 30,000 ft, minus 34°; 50,000 ft, minus 59°. Sky conditions: high scattered clouds, eleven miles visibility. Other weather remarks: Inversion at approx 1500 to 1600 ft; haze and smoke in all quadrants; north-south shear line

west of base 6,000 to 40,000 feet; no weather balloons were
released from local area. Investigation: Houston Museum of
Natural Science cannot offer any celestial explanation for
observation. Local ACW radar and Houston International Tower
radar reported no unusual sittings. Houston Tower radar reported
minor anonymous propagation indicating the presence of an inversion.
Remarks: This siting caused considerable interest by local news
media. Conclusion: Preliminary investigation failed to uncover
any facts substantiating the presence of an unknown object. There
is no question in my mind that something was seen; however, the
presence of inversion conditions, the fact that object remained
in one location for over an hour, and that similar sittings were
observed in other sections of the area causes me to suspect the
sittings were caused by surface lights being reflected off the
inversion layer.
