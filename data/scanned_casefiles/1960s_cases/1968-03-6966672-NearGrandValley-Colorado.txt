Reference your unidentified observation of 28 March 1968. On the evening of 28 March 1968, at 9:24 pm, an ATHENA missile was launched from Green River, Utah. The burning characteristics of the boosters for the payload of the ATHENA would be very similar to those reported by you; therefore, the object you saw and reported was very likely the ATHENA.

Dear Sir:

I'm unidentified flying object was observed by me, and by several others the night of Thursday, March 28, 1968 at about 9:30 PM, near Grand Valley, Colorado.

The object appeared as a light moving almost straight up, in the western sky. The light went out, came back on again a few seconds later, the object being in a position one would expect if drawn at a rate of motion across the sky. It appeared to be traveling toward the west. The angle from my position to the light was toward the about 5 city blocks facing the southwest. This went the light stayed on, I noted years, first to ten seconds, then went out, continued the stay for some minutes, but did not see the object again.

The speed of the object we were the Sky
appeared to be the time to pass three times, that of
a commercial jet. I was to emphasize
that the appearing of the object in the
west was completely different from the
first object within frame. It appeared to be
coming up from the ground. The
general appearance of the trajectory
made me think of a recluse, reclining the first on a sea & stage
when the light went on, it seemed to
go on instantaneously, but when
it went off, it did not appear to go
off instantaneously, but appeared to
fade off, the interval of fading being
a fraction of a second. There was not
any place of twilling which would
suggest the following of a first stage
& minute and a half (on time) could
have a semi-similar to that wide
line a jet passing over. I could not
see any jet. When it did not immediately
seem to me that the same may have
come from the object because of the
long time of use.

I reckoned my steps, between the last
sighting of the object and the hearing of

The second, and concluded that the elapsed time was not less than approximately a minute and a half, and possibly was substantially more. This would indicate, would not, that the object was at an altitude of the order 100,000 ft. or more, if the sounds were produced by its passage.

If it was at this height or met its different path of passage across the heavens would indicate a scale of the order of meteor and missile speeds, rather than jet speeds.

On the other hand, if the sounds did not come from the object, then I found no evidence of any sounds from the object, as no other sounds were heard. I was in quiet country surroundings.

The light was almost the color that are ordinary plane affairs at night. It appeared a strange orange to the stars. The brightness appeared almost that of Jupiter. This was just a suggestion that it was not clear, but yet the step of what might be called evident.

Sincerely,
