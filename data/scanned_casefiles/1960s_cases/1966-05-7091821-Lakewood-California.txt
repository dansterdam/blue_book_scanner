STARING ON THE SIDE WALK IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE WHEN WE SAW AN OBJECT IN THE SKY.

IT WAS ABOUT 300 MILES UP, AND WAS TRAVELING FROM NW - THE HORIZON. IT WAS MOVING VERY FAST (FASTER THAN COMMON SET OR X-15). WE HAD THE OBJECT IN SIGHT FOR 15-30 SECONDS, SINCE IT WAS MOVING VERY VERY FAST.

THE UFO WAS WHITE WITH A RED PIGMENT OF LIGHT IN THE CENTER.

THE OBJECT ITSELF WAS A PINPOINT OF LIGHT ABOUT AS BIG AS A STAR. IT WAS AS BRIGHT AS A FULL MOON, IT NOT BRIGHTER. WE BOTH SAW THE OBJECT AT THE SAME TIME. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE OBJECT WAS BUT (OVER)
