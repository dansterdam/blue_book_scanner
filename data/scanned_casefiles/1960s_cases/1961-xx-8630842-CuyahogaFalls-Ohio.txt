NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

RUSHVILLE, NEBRASKA

Transcript of article appearing in the Sheridan County (Nebraska) STAR
12 January 1961. Taken from transcript sent to Civilian UFO Research by
a member living in the area.

The mysterious fascinates us all. And there was a mysterious object
in the heavens over Rushville several nights ago which was seen and
smelled by many responsible people in and near Rushville.

Those who saw it reported it looked like a big round light globe
that was very bright and visible for a time only, to disappear and pop
up in some other part of the sky. Some smelled a strong odor of gas,
described by Sheriff Hills as very much like tear gas.

The same night, her son and a strong they could only take it for a
few minutes and by the time they got home, the boys eyes were so af-
fected they entered for a couple of hours.

When Mrs. went to the phone to report it to Sheriff Hills, she
looked out the window and saw a very brilliant light that seemed to be
floating in the sky over the school house. It was not a flame and did
not drop quickly as a meteor or any falling object might, but just waved
its way toward town and suddenly disappeared.

Sheriff went down town and the gas odor was so strong he at first
thought it was tear gas but when he checked his supply, no gas was missing.

The same night, and though he started in that
direction but before he could get there the light faded, later appearing
to the north of town.

20 saw what looked like a bright globe hovering just at the crest of a hill
but as they speeded up to get closer it turned to sort of a rosy glow and
faded out.

Near the Rushville hospital and the two boys and
and saw the same or a like object in the sky.

One told the story to his science teacher, who, one
time not long ago, had been a classified report on "Flying Saucers" and
other unidentified flying objects being seen all over the nation. Some
people and some scientists think that other worlds out there in space may
be inhabited and that it is possible they are trying to contact us, just
as we are trying to reach them. Even the Air Force, which investigated all
reports of flying objects (and which sent a major from Rapid City to inter-
view the folks who saw this one) admits that even careful checking fails
to turn up any known explanation for about 5% of these reports even though
95% are explainable.

So, keep your eyes on the heavens, some "little men" from outer space
might, just want to drop in for a visit.

I would appreciate comment on this incident.

6 June 1961

Dear [redacted]

I have your letters of 26 May and 1 June in hand.

Regarding the Trinidade Island sighting, we know of no photographs being sent to the Brazilian Navy for comparison purposes. However, if you will look closely at the photographs (from your letter) I will assume you have seen any or all known shadows on the ground. I assume the various shadows on these on the object. We can only conclude that the photograph was a double exposure.

We have no knowledge of the Nashville, Nebraska, sighting. Perhaps you could furnish more details. For your information, sightings and fireballs leave a pungent odor (ozone).

Regarding the cited publications in your letter of June last, I must point out to you that the Air Force cannot prevent civilians from doing what they will. We must warn than should their acts or intentions involve the Japanese laws and should they be held in violation which does have juridical consequences. However, it is vital in handling such a case that the civilian concerned is aware that it is vital intelligence, then he is subject to the espionage laws. The Congresses of the United States, however, I must emphasize that the Air Force or any defense department is not the sole agency. Other federal agencies are constituted to deal solely concerned with the prevention of compromise of the security information.

I trust this information explains the questions brought forth in your letters.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN

Dear Sir:

You are probably aware that, during late 1957 and early 1958, Brazilian Navy personnel observed a number of unidentified flying objects at and near the Island of Trindade, in the Atlantic. One of the people involved in the case has been quoted as saying that U.S. officials sent photographs to Brazilian officials Compani- son with photos taken on 16 January 1958 at Trindade.

Since the U.S. Air Force, by virtue of AFR 200-2, has control of UFO research in this country, and therefore would have been the American agency involved, I would like to have this statement confirmed or denied.

In another case, several people in and around Rushville, Nebr., reported seeing a luminous globe early in January, 1961, that emitted a pungent odor. An Air Force major from Rapid City, S.D. (probably Ellsworth AFB), investigated the sighting.

I would like to know the results of his and any other investigations of this particular sighting.

You immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Civilian UFO Research

Gentlemen:

In March 1960 I wrote to you asking for a "report" on outside sources of the CIRVIS system, as utilized in JANAP 146(a) participants. In answer to charges that the Air Force was not making CIRVIS records available, I was told that CIRVIS records will be shared.

In his reply of 18 May 61, Lt. Col. (then Major) Tasker said that the answer was a "definite 'no'."

May I point out that Section III, para. 210, of JANAP 146(c) states that "all persons using or the contents of CIRVIS or ARTRIS reports are governed by the Communications Act of 1934 and Espionage laws. And that the headquarters and transmitting agency or any violation of the contents of CIRVIS reports in any manner is prohibited."

I understand, of course, that these restrictions are intended for reports of interest, formations, miles, submarines, etc. and most likely not for the general character of the security provisions (UFO); if they did not explain to one the nature of the information desired (UFOs) why was this not expedited within the body of the instruction? It certainly would not have resulted in an undue amount of effort.

Would you, for sake of clarification, please inform me as to what extent the security provisions cover UFOs?

Sincerely yours,
Director
Civilian UFO Research

Major William T. Coleman
UFO Project Officer

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Coleman:

On 10 June 1961, at your request, I sent you information regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early in January, 1961. I would appreciate knowing, in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 8, the outcome of the official study into this sighting.

Would you please send me a copy of the latest DOD News Release on the subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two Chicago-area sightings. (A Nov 57, Elmwood Park, Ill 55, Des Plaines, Ill.) I have been trying to obtain information about those incidents for over a year. If I cannot get a thorough moral channel, I may be forced to seek assistance, as I have done before.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of UFO reports (20 Aug 61, 5 Sep 61) over Cincinnati, Ohio. I would like to know the official conclusion in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 8.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are competent for the work you are doing. I hope you will provide the information requesting, thereby insuring that both these characteristics will remain unchanged.

Sincerely,
Director
Civilian UFO Research

                                                        Andean Highway, Venezuela

One other tragedy and another near tragedy UFO encounter occurred in Venezuela on January 1, 1961. A government topographer in Merida, Venezuela was driving his car from La Victoria to E. Vigia. Suddenly a brilliant metallic disc or object like polished blue steel swept down at incredible speed or passed close to the hood of a passing truck. The object rose into the sky immediately and was lost to view. In the air, the disc road eight in seconds. When the disc road overturned in the direction of the object. This truck was overturned in a nearby sandbank and rolled over with two airmen. The driver of the truck escaped with minor scratches and nervous shock.

Pacific Ocean

On January 13, 1961 a "mystery object" was tracked over the Pacific Ocean by a USAF radar station on Shemya Island, off Alaska. As there was no advanced international warnings as in previous Soviet Pacific shots, as Russian ships were a days sailing time from the impact area, as there was no splash noted and no further visual/radar or transmissions reported, this object could have been a UFO or another one of those objects from outer space.

I STARTED FROM THE HOUSE ABOUT 11:15 P.M. WITH MY BIRD DOG TO HUNT. WE WERE ABOUT 700 FEET BACK IN THE FIELD YARD IN SOME WIRE AS I LOOKED UP AHEAD IN THE SKY AND SAW 3 SMALL CLOUDS THEN I SAW AT BACK OF THE THING I TOOK MORE STEPS AND THOUGHT SOMETHING PARTICULAR SO I GLANCED BACK UP AT THE CLOUDS THEN I REALIZED WHAT IT WAS. THE TOP AND BOTTOM CLOUDS WERE GOING FROM WEST TO EAST BUT THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE WAS GOING FROM EAST TO WEST AGAINST IT.

THEN I NOTICED A POWERFUL ORAL CLOSE, AS I WATCHED THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE CONTINUING TO MOVE TO THE WEST THEN THE CLOUD SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR OR FERN INTO A METALIC EGG SHAPED EGG SHAPED OBJECT THEN MOVING TO THE WEST AGAINST THE WIND WEST. IT TILTED UP AND THE SIDE CHANGED FROM IT TILL IT STOPPED SOME IN THE AIR FOR A FEW SECONDS. THEN IT SEEMED TO ME BACK AGAIN AND HELD UP AND THEN FADED FROM VIEW (SOUTH) IT MOVED VERY SLOWLY ACKNOWLEDGED UP AND THEN MOVED FROM THE EDGE OF IT CAME UP SEEMED TO BE HAZY OF LIGHT WHILE VERY ALTERNATELY BRIGHT.


- page 19 -

Like n spot right and darker black after 2 seconds of this it tinted further back and wobbled a little more then on back to right up and away from me slowly then I began around to see if anyone else was out.
