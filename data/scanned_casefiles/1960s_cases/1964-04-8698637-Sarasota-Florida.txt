Forwarded for your information. This base does not have the
necessary information to supply and since it has to deal with
UFO, felt that you would want to send this on to higher head-
quarters.

The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter addressed to an Operations Officer at the Mc Dill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.

Sarasota,Florida
April 28,1964

Operations Officer
Mc Dill Air Force Base
Tampa,Florida

Dear Sir:

Writing with the hope that you can supply me with some information that I am curious about. The object that I am interested in is a photo or a description of a lighted streamers balloon in operation and how they operate at night.
As an ex-service man(1945-1953) and a native U.F.O. fan,there is an other item that I am curious about.
If you have two jets flying a parallel course,why is it that one jet has the usual navigation lights,and the other jet has only one light? Is this a single light an unrelated object to the jet?
The reason for the questions are the diagram on the attached sheet of what I have seen in the sky April 27,1964.(7:45-8:15)

Cordially,
