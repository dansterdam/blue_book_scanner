Forwarded for your information. This base does not have the necessary information to supply and since it has to deal with UFO, felt that you would want to send this on to higher headquarters.

Dear Sir:

Writing with the hope that you can supply me with some information
that I am curious about.
The object that I am interested in is a photo or a description of a
lighted weather balloon in operation and how they operate at night.

As an ex-service man(1945-1953) and negative U.F.O. fan,there is an
other item I am curious about.
If you have two jets flying a parallel course,why is it that one jet
has the usual navigation lights,and the other Jet has only one light?
Is this single light a reflection(2 O'clock) or is the light an un-
related object to the jet?
The reason for the questions are the diagram on the attached sheet
of what I have seen in the sky April 27,1964. (7:45-8:15)

Cordially,
