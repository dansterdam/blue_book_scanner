11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Called SPADATS for decay information, and they replied there probably were but due to the large date span a specific object cannot be identified due to the large amount of space junk every day entering the earth's atmosphere.

Object was extremely bright round (or spherical), starting out with a size and brightness slightly greater than a bright stage of Venus, ending up brighter than and slightly larger than a full moon. Object was originally sighted 10 deg above horizon, ending up 80 deg above horizon, on a WNW to ESE line. Brightness of fire and the fire being momentarily extinguished. Final position was not an explosion, but instead an off shooting of satellite round objects.

I REGRET I CANNOT TIE THE DATE
DOWN BETTER; BUT I DO RECALL
THE OTHER DETAILS FAR BETTER
THAN THE DATE.

I HAVE DELAYED THIS
REPORT BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
(UNSUCCESSFULLY) TO HAVE AN
ILLUSTRATION OF THE PHENOMENON
MADE - UP AT WORK. ALSO, I
DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE
COINCIDENCE OF THE CAL TECH
STUDENT BALLOON HOAX OF ABOUT
THE SAME TIME.

Here is the text from the document:

(EVANLY REPT. CONTINUED)                A-3

SPECIAL PHENOMENON CONTINUED

- AT FINAL BREAK-UP, FRAGMENTS DID NOT CONTINUE ACROSS SKY LIKE MAIN OBJECT) BUT WENT OUT STRAIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS & EXTINGUISHED AFTER APPROX. 10° ARC.

WITNESSES: NONE. (CALLED WIFE & CHILDREN BUT THEY DID NOT GET OUTSIDE IN QUICK ENOUGH TIME)

SOUND & ODORS: - NONE. (OR NONE SPECIAL)

LATER ACTIVITY: NONE - (I WATCHED FOR ANOTHER 1/2 HR., THEN LISTENED ON RADIO FOR A UFO, METEORITE, OR PLANE CRASH REPORT - BUT THERE WAS NONE.)

COMMENT: I KNOW THIS WOULD SEEM LIKE A METEORITE AT FIRST ANALYSIS) BUT THE ON & OFF LIGHT EFFECT, & THE FINAL ODD BREAK-UP, REMOVED IT FROM THAT CATEGORY IN MY AMATEUR ANALYSIS. ALSO, IT JUST SEEMED WAY TOO SLOW FOR ANY METEORITE FALLS I'VE SEEN.

    OFF & ON (BUT NOT
    REGULARLY) (LIKE A
    PLANE ON FIRE & THE
    FIRE BEING MOMENTARILY
    EXTINGUISHED)

DURING

- FINAL POSITION WAS NOT
    AN EXPLOSION, BUT INSTEAD
    AN OFFSHOOTING OF SATELLITE
    GROUND OBJECTS
