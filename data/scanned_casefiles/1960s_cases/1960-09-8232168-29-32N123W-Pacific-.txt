10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Fast moving brilliant object believed to be a/c at 11,000 ft heading 090 dgr. Obj moved fm 090 dgr to 020 magnetic. Obsvrs a/c speed 215 kts. Obj traveling S to N initially. Altitude at 40 dgr to disappearance at 20 dgr. Original brightness, added it suddenly increased brightness. Ten times original magnitude. Retained brightness for 10 seconds. Shut off & then reappeared after 20 seconds. Retained brilliant until disapp over horizon. Total sighting 2-3 mins.

11. COMMENTS
Observers believed obj to be a/c. Light phenomena reason for rpt. Case evaluated as a/c. Possibly landing light turned on to create effect reported.

A. OBSERVED FROM APPROXIMATELY 090 DEGREES TO 020 DEGREES MAGNETIC,
40 TO 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORION.

B. DIRECTION: OBJECT TRAVELING SOUTH TO NORTH.

C. SPEED: AS FAST OR FASTER THAN A F-104.

D. ADDITIONAL DATA: WEATHER CLEAR, MOON NOT IN AREA VIEWED. COLOR
- BRILLIANT WHITE STEADY LIGHT. WHEN OBSERVED FIRST TIME IT WAS
APPROXIMATELY MAGNITUDE OF ECHO ONE AND AS IT FADED OUT IT SEEMED TO
APPROACH WITHIN 20 DEGREES OF THE HORIZON. IT THEN REAPPEARED
APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS LATER WITH A VERY BRILLIANT LIGHT APPROX-
IMATELY TEN TIMES THE MAGNITUDE OF ECHO ONE, THEN SHUT OFF ABRUPTLY
AFTER APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS. AGAIN IT REAPPEARED AS BRIGHT AS IT
WAS THE SECOND TIME REMAINING ON UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED IN THE NORTH.
THE TOTAL TIME OBSERVED WAS FROM 2 TO 3 MINUTES.
