At the bottom right corner, there appears to be some additional text that is partially illegible.

The document also contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be an elongated object or shape with a curved line.

Most of the text on the page is too faint or blurry for me to confidently transcribe.

At the bottom right corner, there appears to be some additional text that is partially illegible, but looks like it might say "HY" or "NY".

There is a black horizontal object/shape in the center of the document, which appears to be redacted or blacked out.

Most of the text on the page is too faint or blurry to be reliably read by OCR.
