Very low & too similar to tank on a water tower, moving many bright red lights at 700-1,000 ft. near Grand Portage, returned heading S to Susy Island (in Lake Superior), descended between a hill on the island disappearing momentarily, reappeared, heading W and disappeared. All maneuvering at slow speed.
