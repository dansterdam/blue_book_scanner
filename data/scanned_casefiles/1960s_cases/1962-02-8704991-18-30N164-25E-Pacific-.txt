not given
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
CIVILS REPORT: Described as possible rocket
entry. Greenish color with white patterning
and zig-zag motion. No photos.
11. COMMENTS
Although duration was not given, it was
reported as a "very brief" sighting, and thus
would be unable to provide sufficient data to
associate it with reentrieg; therefore, it
is more probable that the sighting was a
fireball. Color and flight indicate this.
There is enough information to classify
this as a meteoric sighting.
12. CONCLUSIONS
O Was Aircraft
O Possibly Aircraft
O Was Astronomical
O Probably Astronomical
O Other
O Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown
