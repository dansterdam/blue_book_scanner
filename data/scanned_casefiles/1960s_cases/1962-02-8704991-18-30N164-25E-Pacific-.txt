10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
NEVIS report. Described as possible rocket-reentry. Greenish color with white spurting tail. Visible from 45° elevation through 20° elevation. Direction not reported. Duration not given.

11. COMMENTS
Although duration was not given, it was reported as a possible reentry, and thus would be short. It failed to include breaking up and the reddish color associated with reentries; therefore, it is more probable that the sighting was a fireball. Color and flight indicate this. There is enough information to classify this as a meteor sighting.

☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
