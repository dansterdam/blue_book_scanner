There were no winds, confirmed by weather bureau. There was slight evidence of population vapor. At one time another object was visible. Both objects would fade in precise patterns as long as they were bridged by the beam of a light. Then the apparent beam of light would be suddenly darkened the less bright object would fade from sight. The less bright object would fade often and was seen 5 different times.

4. DATE OF INFORMATION:
19 Sept 1966

5. PLACE AND DATE OF ACQ:
Forwarded by enclosed tape from

6. SOURCE:

San Antonio, Texas phone EDison 3 0787

7. SUMMARY: At approximately 2300 hours, 19 Sept, while enroute from Ft. Knox, Ky., to San Antonio, Texas Mrs. and Mrs. [names blacked out] observed the sight object. (The telephone report is on the enclosed tape.) When first observed they were about 14 miles north of Franklin, Texas. The object was North of them and appeared to move out to a pinpoint and then move in closer. The object, according to conversation with Mrs. [name blacked out], at subsequent to the report, when first observed was about the size of an orange at arms length.

The object was observed at frequent intervals until they arrived at San Antonio at approximately 0545, 20 Sept local time). Although Mrs. [name blacked out] could not give any angular distance above the horizon, she did believe that it was somewhat low. At the last sighting, Mrs. [name blacked out] indicated that they discussed these sightings at the time of observation with a truck driver and with the wife of the sheriff at Hearne but that these people did not seem concerned with the sight.

Comments:
During this period there were large weather balloons loose in this area, one of which was trailing a long cable. No other reports have been received of this and no reports have appeared in the news media.

The original of the tape is held in the Lackland Common Post.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
