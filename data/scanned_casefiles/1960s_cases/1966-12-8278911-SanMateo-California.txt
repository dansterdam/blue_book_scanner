11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    Observer watched three brilliant lights in a V formation travel toward the western sky. To the left a mass of brilliant lights; tops were red, and the bottom was orange. It was about five miles above the ground. The object and the trailing objects looked like orange droplets fell from the tail of the one object.

    A test aircraft was in the area at the time of the sighting. The aircraft was fitted with TV camera and a high-intensity infrared light. This aircraft was conducting a 2000 foot altitude flight and would have been visible from the ground. The nature of the light combined with the clouds in the area would produce an eerie effect from the ground.
