5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Varied

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: Varied

8. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes   ☒ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes   ☒ No

10. CONCLUSION: Aircraft(possible)   Astro(S/F)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched an octagonal object with lights at each angle, with a flat surface, and an inverted bowl on top. The object in formation may very well have been a couple planes flying close together, stated one witness. This same witness did not see the objects close enough to tell. The plane shaped object went over the building very low without any motor sound. Another witness said that she saw a plane flying so low the bright type beams in front nearly blinded us. This aircraft lifted seeming to just clear the building. Also during the observation period several other objects were noted. These objects were red blinking lights that were stationary. The descriptions are consistent with that of an aircraft observation and that of an astronomical observation.

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw:

Flying octagonal object with lights at each angle, with a flat surface, and was interested how it was up there. [partially illegible text at end]

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

These objects in formation may very well have been a couple of planes flying close together. I did not see the close enough to tell. This single object went out behind a very low without sound.

[The rest of the text is partially illegible, but I can make out some parts:]

Observations on distance were made using rate that average city blocks constitute a mile.

Observations on time may be totaling inaccurate, approximated, using the fact that we arrived at Mrs. Lieben's apt. shortly after 9:00 p.m. and talked about 1/2 hour before her children called us to the window to see what they thought were "shooting stars".

There is one point that I am absolutely sure of. That is the actual shape of the objects base. This is because during the time this was in sight, this light were on the phone I opened the phone door and went outside where I would see the object. I pass no judgment with the shape as seen from a certain angle.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Page 8

I was not quite sure what was that I was not quite
convinced that it was a brightly lit plane, and
I thought perhaps I could hear a motor, even
though the sound was very few.

Just after I viewed the object from the
terrace Mrs. Smith joined me and we saw a
plane flying so low that the bright headlight
was very frightening since it seemed to be
almost level with us while approaching and
then, it left seeming to just tear the
building. I do not know if this was a normal
plane or not, but, I have never before seen a
plane fly so low that you could see its full
size, except at an airport. Also there was
110 meter sound or sonic beam afterward.

I do not think that I was so frightened that
I would not hear a plane motor since I could hear
auto horns and we were on the 9th floor. I could
not swear that the other light formations were the
same as the other object since they were about
one-third passed when we saw them and I decided I
would feel better admitting with my family and
I tried to write some of this "object" and
approached the building when my wife came to me
while and...

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object came from the north moving south and dropped out of sight. We called the Daily News. A few minutes later either the same object or a different object came from north towards the building (west) another official came from north towards the building. We called Washington. Then we did call and get through the deputy proceeded closer until it was about 1/2 a city block from us. It seemed as though the phone calls made them come closer because they went toward the point where we hung up. Then called the Daily News again and the object came back in front of the building but closer than ever. I saw on the terrace and they turn the city on me. I don't want you to think were crazy because our story will be a little different. We saw these objects and all reached differently, partly of the phone they looking out the window on the terrace, therefore we all saw different angles of the objects.

There might something that can be checked that we noticed. There was two objects together like stars flickering red & blue. Just before the objects appeared. These stars then began to be coming closer to earth. After this flying...

Here is the text from the document:

objects disappeared for the last time. the star looking objects went higher in the sky until they flickered an almost white color like a regular star. (on November 24, 1966, I saw, the same two star looking objects, still flickering red & blue and showed my family. they all agreed they never saw them before. the same night, we didn't see the star looking objects at all but we could see the regular stars.)

There should be a way to report these things to someone and get immediate action so that the U.S.A. can find out what they are because if someone would have come when we called, they could have been these objects since the stages in sight, for so long. (any place could have gathered into the area) and investigated in the time they stayed visible.

- page 36 -

Para 8 Continued: Then the mammoth plane came from the north and made a sharp 900 angle and came at the building. We began to feel good because I had called the Pentagon and I thought it was one of our planes. (No sound though) It seems as if it was coming at us so we ran inside, drew the blinds and the curtains and the lights were so fierce they came through the windows.

After this happened the other two objects terminated west. I called the Pentagon again (I always got the Command Post) and told the officer what happened and thanked him for getting our planes out so fast. He didn't want to frighten me but it wasn't one of our planes.

I don't go out at night. Those things are stationary in the atmosphere. They are so enormous you can't count them. I can't sleep. I also lost 42 pounds since Nov 20 when I first sighted them.

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and partially illegible. While I can make out some words and phrases, the full text is not clear enough to confidently transcribe in its entirety.]

The document appears to be page 7 of a questionnaire related to a UFO sighting, with a section for additional information about the sighting.
