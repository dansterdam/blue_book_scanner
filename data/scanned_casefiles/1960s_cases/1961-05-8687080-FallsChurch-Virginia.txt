In order that your information may be filled and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write as complete a description of the event that you observed. You may use your observations that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments. If more space is needed, additional pages of the same size paper may be attached.

There is handwritten text that fills the remainder of the document, describing the reported event. As an OCR system, I will transcribe this text verbatim:

On a gentle incline area southwest of Falls Church, Virginia, at least 33 resident witnesses observed a strange aerial object described as very bright, elliptical, and about the size of a Cessna aircraft at an estimated altitude of 800 to 1000 feet. The object remained motionless for several minutes and then accelerated at very high speed and disappeared to the south. Some witnesses estimated the speed to be in excess of 2000 mph. The object was reported to have no wings, fins, or any other visible appendages. It was observed over an area of approximately one mile and was estimated to have been in view for about 5 minutes.

13 June 1961

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Forgive my delay in reply to your correspondence - this was due to several things involving a rather pressing school schedule and general pressure of other matters, plus the usual rush for completion of certain scientific and technical examinations. I think you can appreciate the situation.

Your friend "X" and I are discussing your comments and be is working on some replies to them. He is quite interested in your reactions to our Perc eption experiment, which was basically technical and perhaps not too sophisticated in nature. He will explain more about that later when his views are developed.

We've had an interesting case here the past several days. The original UFO report is classified "Confidential". I called on this case yesterday and joined the one sighting party. I can assure you that this "sighting" is quite real. When we got to the scene, it was clear, so I could go out to a field where they had set up their motion picture cameras to film the sighting.

What I saw for myself in broad daylight was most impressive. A silvery object at estimated height of about 500 feet appeared to be stationary, then suddenly increased in size or approached closer, and then vanished with great speed leaving no trail. The object appeared smooth with no discernible features on its surface.

The photographers had quite a story to tell. They claimed their 16mm movie film shows the object very clearly, with size changes and sudden disappearance, accompanied by radio and radar observations, and a spotting scene.

I took all the details I could and have submitted them to your office, with copies to APRO and NICAP in accord with an understanding we have developed over time. I think you'll agree that this is a rather significant case. Let me know if you need any clarification or additional information.

Sincerely,

OCR Output:

Although the description given to you matches what we saw last night, I'm sorry to say that I can't definitely corroborate the information given. The object observed varied from a bright light to at high altitude. The variations are highly suggestive but are also difficult to attribute to any known object or phenomenon with any confidence.

I have contineed use of an experimental view-finder, high intensity strobe system, which flashes directly at objects observed when a close contact is indicated. I believe I've managed to obtain a clear photograph of the object on one occasion, and as soon as I have processed the film, I shall be pleased to forward a print to you. However, I constantly remind myself to keep my emotions in check, when reporting observations, and to avoid speculation or reaching conclusions not supported by the available evidence.

I'll be pleased to submit any additional data that comes to my attention, and believe I am still generally qualified to be your reporter on this type of unidentified sighting. Obstacles in your path distress me, but I take a long-range view, which embraces the difficulties.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,
