Analysis and Conclusions: THIS OBJECT APPEARS TO HAVE THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS OF A BALLOON SIGHTING WHICH WAS REPORTED TO FTD BY MAJOR W. COLEMAN SAFOVIC. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A BALLOON TO APPEAR BRIGHT AND TO HAVE COLOR IN LATE EVENING SUNLIGHT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS BALLOON WAS OBSERVED TO DESCEND AND WITNESSES. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT A BALLOON.

16 June 1961

Dear Dr. Hansel:

Forgive my delay in reply to your correspondence. This time of year finds me going in circles in order to accomplish my annual flight examinations, astronautics at Jet Instrument School, physical examinations and compilation of Combat Readiness Training minimums.

About, I'm keeping my head just above water at the level of the lake.

Bob Friend and I are discussing your requests and he is working on them. I have forwarded your chapters to him for comment with the request that he mail them direct to you. I read the material along with Col. Thayer and Mr. Sunderman. As they all agreed they were working the book on "How to write a Technical Report", Sunderman is doing a piece on the preparation of the manuscript for writing. Your book will be covered in this piece. It is scheduled for September/October to coincide with the beginning school year (i.e. Air University, colleges, etc.).

We've had an interesting case here the past several days. The original UFO report is a strange one (No. 11). I called an Indiana man and joined him one evening to see this "strange sight". An overcast sky prevented our seeing the object which he claimed had been observed for the previous two weeks. This was about a week ago. Last night was clear, so I moved out onto my patio with field glasses (22X) and a small telescope (SCG)...nothing...nothing for altitude. At 1955EDT I started my vigil. Nothing....220...I see it. Azimuth 300 degrees....altitude 37 degrees...nothing....very well with the radar than Venus...also of Venus. My phone rings...it is my friend above calling to tell me to look. I have no answer this phone, so will call back. My neighbors come over. There is wild speculation. I tell them to sit tight (you can see this very well with the naked eye). I will see it explode in a few moments. It is quite obviously a meteorite. A large meteorite balloon lifted. At 2022 it bursts in a glorious fashion for all the world to see. I chalked up another lesson in parallax and altitude for accuracy. I pinpointed my longitude and latitude...then compared for location. I called the American Meteor Sterling, Virginia. Yes, they had launched a meteorosonde a little after 1900 EDT. The balloon turned over very nicely at 20,000 feet. We matched, I called my "friend", a meteorologist told me he wasn't what he had been seeing for the past few nights. You see, Gerald, might be the first time he had looked at the object through binoculars and a spotting scope.

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One)   Yes   No
If you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One)   Yes   No
If you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?

41. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME
ADDRESS
TELEPHONE NUMBER
Age        Sex  (M/F)

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any education, which might be pertinent.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Although the description given us by him matches what we saw last night, in says this isn't it. Chronology, we'll never convince him.
I have given him the schedule of these balloons...advised of the various from night to night the high altitude winds. He also claims that I really know what's going on, but we (USAF) are keeping it from the people. Oh well, you can't win over a diehard of this caliber.

Enclosed are the TWX's that tell the recent Florida story. FAA has confirmed use of an experimental over-under, high intensity strobe beacon which flashes alternately. It is being used on some of the civilian air carriers throughout the country.

Believe it or not, and I am still a young man(or trying to be), I'm reviewing a couple of my books on logical argument. I have to constantly counsel myself to keep my emotions in check when replying to letters from out-and-out crackpots. But, because we are a government agency, we have to eat a lot of crow. How nice it would be to call a spade just once. I enjoy marshaling solid, readable arguments to Avery. You do a masterful job in replying to this one. I consider myself fortunate indeed that I have never been exposed to teachings of a man of his caliber.

I hope this finds you enjoying the good Summer and finding no obstacles in your path.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN

P.S. The pressure for open hearings has been mounting. It looks as if we will get by because adjournment is not far off and there's a lot of stalling.
