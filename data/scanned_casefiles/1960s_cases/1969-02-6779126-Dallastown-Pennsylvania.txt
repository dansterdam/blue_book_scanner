Dear Sir,

I have been interested in UFOs for nearly three years now. I have many materials on this phenomena which I find fascinating. They are the works of Vallee, Michel, the Lorenzens, Ruppelt, Edwards, Binder, Adamski, Gibbons, Menzel, Ruppelt, Stanton, Steiger, Wurtemberger, French, Fuller, Watkins & their works, like Condon Committee.

To get to the point just this evening (Feb. 15, 1969) at about 6:30 I spotted a bright, yellow, glowing UFO traveling northwest to southeast at about the speed of a jet. This UFO was spotted in the "sky", it was a non-blinking light. Therefore it could not have been a plane or jet. I wish I could give you more information on it but I can't. Had it within sight between thirty and forty seconds. Can you explain it?

Also please send me information regarding UFOs. When if you don't, please answer my letter. You see I just want to receive a letter from you would be a thrill.

Thank you for reading this.

Yours truly,
[signature redacted]
