J. APPROXIMATELY 23232 COLUMBIA, MO AND PEORIA, ILL
US WEATHER BUREAU RELEASE UPPER AIR OBSERVATION BALLOON

K. PREPARING OFFICER, CAPT ROBERT E. BOOTH, A0383399, 3361ST INSTRUCTOR CO., CHANUTE AFB, ILLINOIS, BELIEVE THAT THE GROUND SIGHTING WAS A UPPER AIR OBSERVATION BALLOON RELEASED BY FACILITIES MENTIONED IN PAR J ABOVE.

SO STATES THAT A BALLOON OVER RANTOUL, ILLINOIS SIZE APPROX 50 INCHES DIAMETER WOULD GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF THE SIGHTING IN THE TELESCOPE. THE CLOSER TO DANVILLE IT MOVED THE SMALLER THE DIAMETER WOULD NEED TO BE TO GIVE SAME APPEARANCE. OTHER SIGHTINGS IN THE AREA WERE TO CLOSE FOR ANY USEFUL TRIANGULATION. OTHER WITNESSES OF THE SIGHTING WERE MR. [REDACTED] AND MR. [REDACTED] OF DANVILLE. MR. [REDACTED] OF DANVILLE. ALL WITNESSES ARE BELIEVED TO BE RELIABLE.
