11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Greenish-White light turning to red and white. Object changed direction and fluctuated in altitude. Direction was SS? The only celestial body visible at in the nearby clear dawn was the moon which was half phase and south of witnesses. The cloud cover which moved in to obscure the UFO moved from approximately what appeared to be north to south or NE to SW. Direction and other details are questionable and conflicting. Requesting Plattsburgh AFB to investigate sighting in accord with AFR 200-2 to clarify the sighting.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting                                                   19 May 1966

TO:    AFSC FTD
        Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

Due to elapsed time on receipt of this sighting (9 days), 
no reliable additional information obtainable. Description 
of its past experience where planet Venus emits various hues 
of lights and appears abnormally large when it rises ahead 
of the sun as was the case on 10 May 1966. First noted 
movement, up and down, probably caused by refraction. Other 
apparent movement could be result of observation from moving 
vehicle.
