Dear Sir:

On the night of July 14th at 9:00 PM
some green misty formations and searchlights on Truitt, Illinois as we were
in our quarters noticed he thought he was experiencing lights @. We watched out now
and judged that they were too far apart and moving
too slowly to be aircraft from our area. We
conclude that they must be then of an
aircraft that was going to combat. Quickly soon the lights spread over @ and
then we couldn't know what they were. They
kept spreading @ and were very powerful
to give us more idea that they were not
any could shine such area, central idea in your
from story.

1. Reference the attached letter from _____________ request-
ing information on unidentified flying objects. This letter has
been forwarded to this office for information upon which to base
a reply.

2. It should be pointed out that the duration and time sequence
pertaining to motion was omitted. It is likely that observation
was generated by light aircraft, if the duration was less than
an hour. At this date, it would not be worth while to check
on aircraft operating in the area since aircraft of this nature
file plans only with the airport from which they take off. It
is not necessary to send an FTD Form 164 since additional infor-
mation is not likely to alter the general description of the
sighting.

Dear [redacted]

This is in reply to your recent letter concerning some unusual light formations you and your father observed on July 11, 1964.

It is possible that you were watching the lights from some small airplanes. Sometimes lights can give an unusual appearance due to their position in the sky, or to unusual atmospheric conditions.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
