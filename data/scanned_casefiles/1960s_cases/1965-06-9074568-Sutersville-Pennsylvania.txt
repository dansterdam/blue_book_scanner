1. Reference the attached correspondence, dated 5 Jun 65, subject as above. Letter is forwarded for action as appropriate.

2. This office, in cooperation with USAF SPACETRACK, was unable to correlate this observation with any event of which we have record. All foreign and domestic satellite decays during the period were well documented and the event closest to the stated time of observation was the GT 4 sustainer body, SPADATS Object number 1391; this decay occurred approximately 16 hours from this window and was to the southeast of his location rather than northwest. In addition, there is no record of any satellite fragmentation during this period.

3. We consider the possibility of the visual sighting of antennae at orbital or decay altitude as being extremely unlikely.

4. Any assistance you can provide Mr. [REDACTED] will be appreciated.
