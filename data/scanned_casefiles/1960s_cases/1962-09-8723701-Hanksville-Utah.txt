Shiny silver object flying parallel to a/c flying West at 31,000 feet. In sight from Denver, Colorado, to Hector California. Pilot believed object was planet.

11. COMMENTS
Planet Jupiter in Southern sky most likely object to be misinterpreted. Reported by several pilots on various flights. Some considered a planet as being observed. Movement to West consistent with this analysis. Since jet was flying West the object would retain its same position for the duration of the flight.
