15th Air Force Command Base
March Field, Calif.

Dear Sir:

At the suggestion of the L.A. Police Dept. I am sending you the facts of an event of Thursday May 28, 1964, sometime past 9:30 PM.

From my 5th floor apt. just below Sunset Strip in W. L.A. I stood at my window. I thought I saw a giant yellow heading far the building. There were three lights thus: O O O. Considered it was flying because it was so off course because me are not in an area I thought of New York and the Empire State building crash and thought to run into the able to alert the tenants. I was frozen with fear however - and could not move.

Of a sudden I realized the lights were now stationary, looking approached at a high speed. However in the blink of an eye they veered of at practically a right angle toward Santa Monica and again staged stationary, then disappeared. O O O

The color was as a four or fluorescent orange-tint and a greenish glow.
