10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Small oval obj with white glow brighter than the brightest star visible observed in diameter from the Moon at the moon's 3 o'clock position. Obj gradually moved around moon to 12 o'clock position of moon 3 diameter's length. This motion took 15 mins. Then obj moved to about 15 diameter of Moon in two particles with one being a grey cloud-like followed with BK. No longer visible to naked eye. Obj split in two again gradually faded. This sequence consumed one min. Total duration 17 min. Sighting at dusk toward setting sun.
