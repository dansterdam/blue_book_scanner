1. DATE: 13 May 64
2. GEOGRAPHIC GROUP: Mount Vernon, Virginia
3. TYPE OF OBSERVER: D-2 (Radar)
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: D Visual, D Air-Intercept Radar
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 17 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one/two
9. COURSE: West
10. COMMENTS: One light source which appeared to be rotating or pulsating. This light source was first noted by an observer standing on a hill and was visible for about 3 minutes. The light source then disappeared and reappeared in the northwest about 15 minutes later. At this time a second light appeared moving in a northerly direction and the original light was also visible. The two lights moved in parallel along a path about 10-15 degrees above the horizon for about 2 minutes, then the original light dimmed and faded. The second light continued moving north and was visible for about 2 more minutes. This sequence consisted of alternating disappearance and reappearance of the lights.
