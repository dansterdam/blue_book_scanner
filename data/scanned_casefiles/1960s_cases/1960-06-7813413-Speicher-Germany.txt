The text on the page provides details about wind speeds and directions observed during a sighting, as well as comments from a preparing official regarding the observer's enthusiasm about the sighting but the official's belief that the scattered cloud cover and the location between two air bases could have provided the observer with a possible reflection of either the bases' beacons or a passing aircraft.
