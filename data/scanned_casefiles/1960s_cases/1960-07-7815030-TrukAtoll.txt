Report of Unidentified Flying Object

On July 26, 1960, a report was made by a representative of the Marine into the High Commissioner's office that an unidentified object which was sighted near Palau, I dwelled to investigate the matter and came to Ponape. In the early morning, one 19, we as the caller was sighted the object from Pontal; male, age 19, was attached and identified the object. In addition, he drew a sketch of the object, which is attached.

In the statement from the best who saw the object; male, age 37, and male, age 19, were also present. There were told by Finiis, Heitor of the two adults verify the statement but appears to be reasonably intelligent and alert and completely sincere. While it doesn't appear in the statement, I asked him as to the reputation of the two men and he said to the best of his knowledge they were considered reliable and trustworthy.

It is thought that perhaps you may wish to forward the report to Naval Intelligence for information. Also in may be, if any.

(Translated from Trukese)
Ponape, age 10, resident of Satowan, Petta Municipality July 27, 1960

About two weeks ago, I was accompanied by Meolcholong, a 37 year old male, walking a boy of nine years of age near where I live near the roof near the west. The woman on the road - Atachong, Tokin was - I remained on the spot. It was a helping - a thing floating over the water. I watched it rise. Then I saw for the small boy, the best to the sky. I started to walk. I started to find it. The thing was floating up in the air. It was a thing like a "Manta" - the start of it. The thing was about the size of a small boat and it was in the air. Maybe about 250 meters high. It was white and no other thing was painted and white. When we came, the road was very recent. I couldn't hear any noise or sound. When we came, about 250 meters from it, it slowly moved up straight and then slowing toward the south. At that time was cloudy, the sun was off at an angle toward the west. I was in the air or 12 o'clock in the morning. The south side, and the clouds above, our own cloud, then started very slowly. I started back to the roof but the thing was still there. I told this thing to the woman but they did not see it.
