Chief Liaison Officer

To: C-2,

Reference is made to a telephone conversation today between Mr. and Mrs. --------- and this office.

The information given verbally in this conversation is confirmed as follows:

On July 22, Mrs. --------- reported having observed a "strange object" hovering over her home for approximately 10 minutes at about 1900 hours. The object was described as circular in shape, bright orange in color, and about the size of a large automobile.

Investigation by the District Administrator in this area indicates that no unusual aerial activity was observed by any other resident, and no other reports of such sightings have been received.

Very truly yours,

REDACTED

THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
District Attorney
July 20, 1960
Report of Unidentified Flying Object
Investigation of the report of an unidentified flying object, based on the attached statement by Master Sergeant Barney I. Leyland, United States Air Force, Truk Atoll, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, on July 19, 1960, as follows:
On July 19, 1960, at approximately 7:45 a.m., Sergeant Leyland observed in the sky a bright, metallic, circular object which hovered for several minutes, then moved away at a high rate of speed. It was observed by Sergeant Leyland for approximately one minute. The object appeared to be approximately 60 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick. It was metallic in appearance with no visible means of propulsion. The object did not make any sound as it hovered and moved away.
There were no other witnesses to the sighting. Sergeant Leyland is considered reliable and intelligent, and his report is considered sincere and worthy of investigation.
It is requested that perhaps some agency of the government would be willing to investigate this matter further. If you desire any additional information, please advise.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no visible photograph on this particular page. The text appears to be a detailed written report describing some kind of incident or observation.

STATUS CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICTED FROM PUBLIC

Pandora, may 13, president of General Pedro Rodriguez alie.

The object that I saw on the night of July 27, 1956 was a very large disc-shaped object with lights around the perimeter. It was hovering and made no noise. I estimated its diameter to be approximately 75 to 100 feet. The object hovered for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and shot straight up out of sight at a very high rate of speed. 

I was very impressed by the performance of this object, as it made no sound and its movements were very different from any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I am convinced that this was not an ordinary aircraft, but some type of advanced craft of unknown origin. I have no explanation for what I observed that night, and I would be most interested to learn if any similar sightings have been reported in this area.

I hope this report is helpful in your study of unidentified flying objects. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.
