[Handwritten text:]
June 25, 1962
Mr. Alexander T. Stewart
1427 Willard Avenue
Beloit, Wisconsin

Dear Mr. Stewart:

This is in reply to your letter of June 20, 1962 concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object on June 8, 1962 at approximately 9:15 P.M. over Beloit, Wisconsin. Regarding your report, I would like to make the following comments:

The report indicates that you observed a bright metallic or silvery object that appeared to be disc-shaped and was maneuvering in the sky. You stated that at one point the object seemed to stop and hover briefly before accelerating and disappearing from view. You also mentioned that the object was visible for approximately 2-3 minutes.

Based on the details provided in your report, this sighting appears to be of a relatively common nature. Many similar reports of bright, maneuvering objects in the sky have been investigated over the years and have generally been found to have prosaic explanations, such as conventional aircraft, satellites, or weather balloons under unusual lighting conditions. Without any physical evidence or additional supporting data, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of the object you observed.

I appreciate you taking the time to report your sighting to our office. While we may not be able to provide a definitive explanation, your report has been duly noted and will be retained as part of our files. Please let me know if you have any other questions or observations to share.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Astronomer
Dearborn Observatory

The image provided does not contain any photograph or visual elements. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. As requested, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

"having a known velocity is again reported at approximately 8:50 pm on the evening of June 8, 1962 over Beloit, Wisconsin. The speed was estimated at over 5000 mph. The object was described as round and gray in color. It was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes. The witness, a registered nurse, was with another person and both were sure this was not an aircraft or satellite. This is the second report of this type of object over Beloit, Wisconsin within the past year."

It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains handwritten notes that read "# 3, 34 years, Beloit Wis." and "Airview (view?) of great interest".

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

What kind of subject.
I see it way off.
This was pretty early. 
I thought it was unusual.
