Sir,

I am a boy of 12 years of age. I believe we have some in the town of Crestline, Ohio. I sighted a small white light, about the size of a star, travelling southward. It stayed in a stationary position, just left of much so fast for one. It then began to move westward and moved towards the southwest and disappeared straight down. I hope this information, which I sincerely and honestly believe to be true, can give an answer, which I would be grateful to obtain.

Sincerely,

P.S. - My name contains some information on a UFO sited
