Sir,

I am a boy of 12 years of age. I believe very much in U.F.O.'s. On Dec 31, 1967 I noticed a small white light, about the size of a star, daringly brightly. I thought it was a satellite, but it went much so fast for one.

It then began to "flash" red and white and then towards the southwest and drop straight down. I would like having reasonable explanation, tell or Myrick can make one up. If he says it is something like swamp gas, etc. he can forget service me that answer. I saw & wanted a reasonable answer, which Dr. Myrick, or yourself, for that matter can give.

Sincerely,

P.S. Send me some information on U.F.O.'s
Send 117
