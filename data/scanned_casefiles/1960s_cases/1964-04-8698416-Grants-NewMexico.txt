GRANTS, NEW MEXICO
REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
8 APRIL 1964

On 8 April 1964, several observers reported seeing a bright light in the sky near Grants, New Mexico. The light was observed moving erratically and making abrupt changes in direction. It was visible for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing.

Project Blue Book investigators were dispatched to the area to investigate the incident. Interviews were conducted with the eyewitnesses, and the location and time of the sighting were documented. No definitive explanation for the sighting was determined, and it was classified as an unidentified flying object.

SUBJECT: Grants, New Mexico Sighting, 26 Apr 64 18 May 64

TO: Maj William C Harrelson 
1531st Combat Crew Training Wing (Tac Tr) 
Luke Air Force Base, Arizona

Reference your letter, Supplemental Information on UFO Report, TXR DO-161-20 30302, 30 Apr 64, Luke AFB, Arizona. The film was developed and printed by Photo Center, Griffiss AFB, New York. The original slides, however, came from Arizona, owner: thanking him on behalf of the Air Force for their use. We did not find any pictures which would be useful in identifying the reported UFO. In fact the slides are blank. However, the sighting and the object/objects described by the witness are well documented on a low level flight. The usual things that might be about the aircraft was its use of a strobe instead of the conventional lights and/or flares. We are returning the photos which were processed and returned to us by the Kodak Company.

1. Contacted Lt j. W. Marshall, personally at his teaching position, Thomasville School, Thomasville, Arizona at 1600 hours, Friday, 1 May 1964.

2. His camera is a KONICA, Model I, 35mm (Camera lens 1:2.0, F-40mm) made in Japan. He took the photograph during a class session with elementary students, 11 May 1964. He stated that he showed the picture to the students, but did not encourage them to discuss the object in the picture as he did not want to cause them to be alarmed or unduly frightened. The photograph is attached. (Ref: Konica cameras, f2, 35mm, 1:2, F40-14, s no: 245451).

3. It is noted that he did not mind letting the 35mm movie frame of the film, that showed the picture, be removed from the camera. The pictures were exposed on a single frame of the film (including one of the object). The pictures have a legal value and introduces the quality that any unauthorized use of the pictures would be illegal and the property control of the film and pictures rests within the control of the 4351st CCTW.

4. Regulations T.O. 00-35D-54 and item 3(1)(2) and (3) in existing directives provide instructions on the handling of unidentified photographic material and directions for personnel on man/UFO contact.

5. The observer appears to be consistent, credible, intelligent, sincere and truthful in his reporting.

THE OBJECT WITH THEM. THE MECHANIC WAS DRIVING A RED INTERNATIONAL PICK-UP TRUCK; NAME UNKNOWN, HAS A GARAGE ON NORTH SIDE OF HIGHWAY 66 IN GRANTS, NEW MEXICO. OBSERVER, WOODRUFF, APPEARED TO BE A VERY RELIABLE AND COMPETENT OBSERVER, WITH AVIATION EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING
HE COMMENTED THAT HIS FIRST THOUGHT ON THE RED LIGHT WAS THAT IT MIGHT BE A NAVIGATION LIGHT, BUT THAT IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT. FROM HIS FIRST POSITION HE WAS LOOKING DOWN TOWARD AN ELEVATED TERRAIN POSITION TOWARD HIGHWAY 66 WHEN HE SIGHTED THE OBJECT AT AN ESTIMATED 500 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. HE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT AN AIRCRAFT WOULD BE FLYING AT SUCH LOW ALTITUDE IN SUCH MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IN A VALLEY. HE COMMENTED THAT ONE RADAR BASE WAS LOCATED VERY NEAR AT LAGUNA, AND ANOTHER AT THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE, BUT " DOUBTED THEY COULD PAINT THE OBJECT BECAUSE OF GROUND CLUTTER AND PERMANENT ECHOS ON THE SCOPE AT ALITUDE OF THE OBJECT". HE WAS VERY HESITANT ABOUT MAKING A REPORT AND DID NOT DO SO UNTIL THE MORNING OF APR 29 AT THE URGING OF, AND AFTER DISCUSSION WITH ANOTHER TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL, WITH REGARD TO NEWS PAPER ITEMS ON SIX OTHER REPORTS IN THE SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO AREA. BELIVE WITNESS TO BE COMPETENT, CREDIBLE, AND TRUTHFUL. REPORTED TO LUKE AFB, ARIZ.
