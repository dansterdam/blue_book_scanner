This image appears to be a detailed road map of New Mexico. The map shows various highways, roads, county boundaries, and Native American reservations. Major cities like Albuquerque are clearly labeled. The map is black and white and contains numerous annotations and markings, suggesting it may have been used for some specific purpose or investigation. There are page numbers visible on the sides of the document (17 and 27), and a stamp or marking in the top right corner of the page.

This is a Mobil Oil road map of the southwestern United States, specifically covering parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico. The map includes:

- A list of "Principal Radio Stations" on the right side
- A compass rose with the Mobil Oil logo in the center bottom
- Detailed road networks and highways
- Cities such as El Paso, Ciudad Juarez, and various towns in New Mexico
- Reservation areas
- An "Important Notice" in small text at the bottom left, partially illegible

The map appears to be from the 1960s based on its style and the context provided. The map is marked with various grid numbers around the edges (78, 79, 80, etc.).

       Luke Air Force Base, Arizona

Reference your letter, Supplemental Information on UFO Report, TWX DO-161-20 20302, 30 Apr 64, Luke AFB, Arizona. The film was developed and printed by the Kodak Company in Chicago, Illinois. Please return these slides to Mr. _______ Phoenix, Arizona, owner, thanking him on behalf of the Air Force for there use.

We did not find any pictures which would be useful in identifying the reported UFO. In fact the slides are blank. However, the sighting and the object reported by Mr. _______ was an aircraft on a low level night photo reconnaissance mission for Project Cloud Cap. The unusual thing about the aircraft was its use of a strobe instead of the conventional lights and/or flares.

20302 20 Apr 64, Luke AFB, Arizona

TO: AFG0
Attn: Capt Wuesthoff
Project Officer "Blue Book"

1. Contacted [redacted] personally at his tracking position, [redacted] school, Phoenix, Arizona at 1300 Hours, Friday, 1 May 1964.

2. His camera is a KONICA, model I, 35mm (Hexar lens 2.8), F-40mm), made in Japan. To took his photograph during "a second sighting in the dark, with lens setting of 2.8 (wide open); speed 1/50; Film Kodachrome f2; 35mm, ASA 25, hand-held; so he is not sure of what he got. If anything.

3. He stated that he did not mind letting the Air Force have the film, but that he wanted to be sure he gets back copies of the pictures (including one of the object). One picture has a legal value and involves a will that is in litigation on comics he is to inherit. I again will cautiously state that since TWX does not contain comics, he probably did not mean this literally.

4. Reference Para 3(2)(3) and Item 3(1)(c) and (f) in subject TWX. Aside of his own local and total observations; personal annotations; also his exact location at time of the three sightings. These are different from locations and headings previously submitted by C.W. and based on television conversation with observer. I met him personally near home on map; since I was not a witness myself and am unfamiliar with the area.

5. The observer also stated that his first thought was that the sighting was "an experimental aircraft on a night photo recon mission, but then - if definitely was not - that it would not fly, but such a low altitude in the terrain of the area at night - three were no navigation lights. Definitely was not an aircraft" "At time of second sighting, what appeared to be a satellite" could also be observed through broken cloud cover on an East-Southeast heading at great altitude, estimated to be 40,000 feet or more."

6. The observer appears to be competent, reliable, intelligent, sincere and truthful in his reporting.

MIGHT BE A NAVIGATION LIGHT, BUT THAT IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT. FROM
HIS FIRST POSITION HE WAS LOKING DOWN FROM AN ELEVATED TERRAIN
POSITION TOWARD HIGHWAY 66 WHEN HE SIGHTED THE OBJECT AT AN
ESTIMATED 500 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. HE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY STRANGE
THAT AN AIRCRAFT WOULD BE FLYING AT SUCH LOW ALTITUDE IN SUCH
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IN A VALLEY. HE COMMENTED THAT ONE RADAR BASE
WAS LOCATED VERY NEAR AT LAGUNA, AND ANOTHER AT THE CONTINENTAL
DIVIDE, BUT " DOUBTED THEY COULD PAINT THE OBJECT BECAUSE OF GROUND
CLUTTER AND PERMANENT ECHOS ON THE SCOPE AT ALTITUDE OF THE
OBJECT". HE WAS VERY HESITANT ABOUT MAKING A REPORT AND DID NOT DO
