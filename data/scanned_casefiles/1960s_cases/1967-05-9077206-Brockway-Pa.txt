Sept. 24, 1967
Brockway, Pa.

Dear Sir:

My 15 yr. old son and I have been watching a moving object in the sky, continuing, since May, 1967.

I have first observed this object it traveled a path from north-west to south-east. About 35 minutes later the same moving, we again observed it traveling the same path, except just a little more southerly orbit. About ten, we again saw this object, but it was traveling a north-west to south-west orbit. We watched for this object again the next evening and saw it traveling the same path as the evening before. This was at approximately the same time and traveling the same path as the first sighting. Then the summer fog set in and we were no longer able to spot this object, could last week it was traveling from west to north-east. The same record as before.

Here is the text from the document:

winers, each evening I'm watching of west
to north east of this object that
the same appearance as a bright
star, and it moves quite rapidly

my son and I are convinced
we are sighting a satellite, but we
would like a few questions
answered: is the satellite are we
watching? and what do we see it
so often in one evening? Is it
orbiting only the United States?
And why does it not travel the
same path each orbit? We
will welcome any information
you can give us on this object.

Sincerely,

[The signature is blacked out]

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of September 24, in which you requested information on your observations of an object in the sky since May, 1967.

Presently, there are over 1100 objects in orbit; over forty are visible to the naked eye.

It takes approximately ninety minutes at the minimum for satellites to make one revolution, the time per revolution being determined by the height. For example, NORAD II is at an approximate altitude of 670 miles and takes about one hour and 40 minutes per revolution. PAGEOS A is at an approximate altitude of 3000 miles and takes about three hours one revolution.

Satellites do not cross the same point on each revolution because the earth is rotating (its axis), thus making the satellite cross to the west of its preceding point on the earth.

We feel that you have probably been watching satellites.

Further satellite information can be obtained from the 1st Aerospace Squadron, Ft Air Force Base, Colorado 80912.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
