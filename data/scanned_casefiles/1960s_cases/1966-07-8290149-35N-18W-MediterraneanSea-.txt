8 July 1966
Mediterranean
Sea

To Whom It May Concern:
Dear Sir:

This letter may be of some interest to you and
for publication:   On July 8, 1966 in latitude 35.5 N and
longitude 18.5 W (Mediterranean Sea) approximately at 2200 ship
time while standing my sea watch on the African Lagoon I noticed
a bright star just setting off about 2 points on the starboard
bow, an altitude about 45 degrees. As I watched it I noticed it
was getting larger and larger and heading directly towards the
ship with tremendous speed. In a matter of seconds, it become
about the size of a full moon. I then realized this was a strange
and fearfull phenomenon taken place. This round bright object
continued to descend directly toward the ship with accelerating
speed until it expanded to a diameter of about 25 feet, at which
time it was just off the starboard bow and a little above the sea.
I started to brace myself for the impact and told the wheelman to
prepare for same. The object then appeared to come to a sudden
stop in mid-air; holding its circular shape and size for a few
moments, its bright glow then began to diminish until the object
faded out completely.
