To whom it may Concern:
Dear Sir:
This letter may be of some interest to you and
for publication: On July 8, 1966 at latitude 35.3 N and
longitude 13.3 E (Mediterranean Sea) approximately at 5300 min
time while standing my sea watch on the African Lagoon I noticed
a bright star just getting off about 3 points on the starboard
bow; on a distence about 43 degrees. As I watched it I noticed it
was getting larger and larger and heading directly towards the
ship with tremendous speed. In a matter of seconds, it become
about the size of a full moon. As it then realized this was a real
and real full phenomenon taken place. This round bright object
continued to descend directly toward the ship with accelerating
speed until it is estimated to a distance of about 25 feet, at which
time it was just off the starboard bow and a little above the sea
I started to brace myself for the impact and told the wheelmaan to
prepare for same.
The object then appeared to come to a sand
stop in mid, -air; holding its circular shape and size for a few
moments, its bright glow then again to diminish until the object
faded out completely.
