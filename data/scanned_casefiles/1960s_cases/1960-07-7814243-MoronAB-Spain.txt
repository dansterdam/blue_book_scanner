INFORMATION ON OBSERVERS: SOURCE A IS WARRANT OFFICER PAUL D.
REPORT, 2-2, DETACHMENT 14, 21ST WEATHER SQ, FORECASTER, COMPLETELY
RELIABLE. SOURCE B IS A COMPOSITE OF VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE COMBAT
DEFENSE FORCE WHICH WAS ON DUTY AT THE TIME. THEY CONSIST OF

VARIOUS ENLISTED RANKS AND AS A GROUP ARE CONSIDERED TO BE RELIABLE.
6. WEATHER AND WINDS: 1. CLEAR SKY AND GOOD VISIBILITY. 2. WINDS
AT THE SURFACE WERE CALM, AT S200STARWP/20, 10,000' -240/30, 15,000'-
22/35, 20,000'-230/43, 30,000'-220/45, 50,000'-250/50 AND
AT 80,000' THE WINDS ARE UNKNOWN. 3. UNLIMITED. 4. 12 MILES.
5. NONE. 6. NONE. 7. SURFACE TEMPERATURE

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. AN AC AND W SITE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY
45 MILES NORTH OF MORON AIR BASE REPORTED OBSERVING NO ACTIVITY
AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. SOURCE A HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF
EXPERIENCE OBSERVING METEOROL ACTIVITY. HE SAID THAT THE
OBJECT LOOKED AND BEHAVED LIKE A PIECE OF SPACE HARDWARE
REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE THAN A METEOR OR METEORITE. HE BASED
THIS ON HIS READINGS OF THE EFFECTS OF REENTRY BODIES RATHER THAN
ANY PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. FROM THE COMMENT OF THE OBSERVERS IT
APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT WAS A LARGE METEOR OR A SPACE VEHICLE
OR ROCKET STAGE REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE. DUE TO THE RELATIVELY
SLOW SPEED OF THE OBJECT PLUS THE INTENSE LIGHT GIVEN OFF IT
APPEARS MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS A SPACE VEHICLE OF SOME SORT
RATHER THAN A METEOR. 1. NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS.
