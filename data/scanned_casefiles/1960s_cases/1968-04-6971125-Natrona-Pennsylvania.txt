(Drawing of How it Came)

April, 19, 1968.

U.F.O. Report,

The object that we had seen was cigar shaped, and it was bright white. It was a good distance from it to us. When we first saw it, its last place we seen it, wherever it went out of our eyesight, was in the N.E. part of the sky.

It was up to high to make out what it actually looked like.

If it would have been a moving star, by what I think, it would have tended to drop and burn up in the earth's atmosphere. If it would have been one. It was up too high to be a plane, and if could have been a satellite, that's how high up it was. We seen on advertising airplane about 7:30 and we noticed the U.F.O. about 5:10 and there were no planes in sight. Tt

The document includes a hand-drawn sketch at the top showing a V-shaped object with stars around it, against a horizon line.

Here is the text from the document:

A clear sky that there was a good many
stars and there are no moon. that it did
travel in a straight line so it could not
have been a star.

On Saturday April 20, 1968 we sighted
it again coming from the direction that it had
disappeared. We returned to the same place, at the
same, we were the following night, at 8:00 we seen
it again. We heard something moving in the bushes,
whatever it was scared us and we went home and
reported it to our Mother and Father.

Ever since I saw this one I've been
taken binoculars with me in case I see
another one I'll be able to give a better
description of it.

TDPF (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mhs/22 May 68
UFO Observation, 19 April 1963

Natrona, Pennsylvania 15065

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 19 April 1963 which you reported to our office.

2. Although your sighting may have been caused by a plane with its landing lights on, our analysis indicates that you were probably watching the satellite Echo 1. At approximately 8 pm, local time, on 19 April 1963, Echo I was outward of your position traveling toward the northeast. Thus, you should have seen Echo I in the southeast and it should have disappeared in the east about five to ten minutes later. Echo I has a clear magnitude of approximately 4 and is nearly as bright as the brightest stars. This satellite has often been misinterpreted as an unidentified flying object.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Victor Quintanilla, Jr., Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Aerospace Technologies Division
