10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched three star like objects in the SSE that appeared as lights-pale blue, red, and white in color. Observers noted a clearing in clouds on a horizontal plane. The objects moved eratically on a horizontal plane. The objects were viewed for about an hour before some clouds moved in and covered the objects.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Sirius and Canopus were visible during the observation. Sirius was at an elevation of 13 degrees on an azimuth of 155 degrees. Canopus was at an elevation of 9 degrees and on an azimuth of about 172 degrees.

Slow rate and manner of movement in addition to general flight path of object indicates that sighting was probably a planet. Theory strengthened by exceptionally clear visibility on this particular night. Const-like tail reinforced by observer in interview was only seen momentarily once or twice during the entire period of the observation.
Subject reported subsequent identical sightings.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer was driving his automobile when he noticed a brilliant, white with intermittent flashing object. Object was stationary. There was no apparent path, the object appeared stationary. The observer lost visual contact while driving & a turn in the road.
The description is consistent with that of a glow type of reflection on the windshield. From the submitted data it appears that a reflection could have been responsible for the incident.

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:

Air traffic on either V73 - V28 could be visible from the point of sighting. Actual traffic unknown.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:

In view of the very scant amount of information offered by the subject on this sighting and the fact that the airly was about 1 1/2 hours after the observer was not relating a turn in his automobile, I can only surmise that the stimulus for this sighting was some form of reflection on the windshield of the subject's automobile. I don't believe sufficient information is available to warrant further investigation.
