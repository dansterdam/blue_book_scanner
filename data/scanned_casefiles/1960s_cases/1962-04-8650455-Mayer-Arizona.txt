DR: ARR 62.

July 30, 1962

Dear [redacted]

Your letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been referred to the Air Force for reply. We are sorry for the delay in answering your letter.

The tin-foil strips you refer to are chaff. Decored from aircraft in bundles, they quickly separate and each piece of chaff gives a radar return resembling an aircraft. These radar returns rather the constantly rising radar noise making the movement of the aircraft. They are extremely effective as they fall slowly and permit the aircraft to pass undetected.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOCKACCO
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information
