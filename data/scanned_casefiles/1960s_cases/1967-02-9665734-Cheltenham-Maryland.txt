The object was 1/10 the size of a match head against the sky.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object's size, proportions, etc. and especially relative size or vapor trails.
A hand drawn sketch depicts a roughly circular object.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Our sighting of an unidentified object took place on the 24th of December 1966, at approximately 7:15pm in Cheltenham, Maryland. We were returning from a Christmas party when we first noticed the object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly and was a round or oval shape with a bluish-white light. At first we thought it might be an aircraft, but it made no sound and the light did not blink as an aircraft light would. It hovered for several minutes and then suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. I was quite puzzled by this and wondered what it could have been. We did not report the incident at the time, but I am now doing so as I feel it may be of interest. I am aware that there have been many similar sightings in this area and I would be most interested to learn if there is any explanation for what we saw.
