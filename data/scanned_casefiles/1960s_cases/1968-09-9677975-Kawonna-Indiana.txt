PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP
14 Sept 68 15/0100Z

2. LOCATION
Kawanna, Indiana (Multiple)

3. SOURCE
Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
Probable Astro (ARCTURUS)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
2 Two

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
90 Minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted what first appeared to be a star. "Of course the stars were out and it was quite dark out. This object seemed very red and orange by just looking up at it."
Of course through the binoculars. We seen flashes of red and on the course the object was seen fairly low in the WSW and last seen in the WNW. The observer also saw another similar light to the S.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual (EX)

7. COURSE
See Case

COMMENTS: There was a temperature inversion in the area at the time. Base Control Tower stated that a bright star or planet was in the general area. In the general area of the reported "UFO". Initially Arcturus was at approximately 17 deg elevation, 281 deg azimuth, at the end of the sighting it would have been at about 3 deg elevation, 295 deg azimuth. Thus the first object was probable Arcturus and the second object also a star/planet but there wasn't enough information

8. PHOTOS
Yes
No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Yes
No

At the top of the document, there is a header that reads:

"57. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING."

The rest of the document is a handwritten narrative, with some names blacked out. The text reads:

"My next door neighbor Mr. [blacked out] first sighted only one flying object, which he thought was a falling star. When it stopped moving, the got then into a binoculars and watched. It had come from the west and was quite a magic size of speed. The wind was calm and a constant glow seemed to make apparent some kind of glow and red lights around the beam. It also then seemed to be a lot of orange flashes from the sides. The object moved my over town at a very slow rate, it moved below our line out then NOTHING to the expense.

Mrs. [blacked out] went back to their home. My husband and two sons stayed out side and watched. Hearing the time we [blacked out] was with us. My husband made the remark. Maybe we should call our friends. No one seemed to move, so I did call myself. I do know the exact lot to be seen over the first. Both sides immediately left.

When my husband and I saw a plane coming from the west. Both sides immediately left. When I walked out to the walk to get a better view of the area, we were watching. I noticed another one. Called to Mrs. [blacked out] and her husband. They also saw the second one."

TO: FTD (TDETR)
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. The attached AF Form 117 is forwarded to you IAW
AFR 80-17.

2. Our base investigation revealed the following:

a. Base Control Tower personnel stated that a
bright star or planet was in the night sky in the
general bearing of the reported "UFO" (Kewanna, Ind).

b. Base RApCon (Radar Approach Control) personnel
stated that there was a temperature inversion
phenomenon noted on their radar scopes in the direction
of Kewanna during the period of the "UFO" sighting and
may have been the source of the appearance of reflected
lights.

c. No further investigation was made into this
reported sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

[Handwritten text near compass rose, partially illegible: "This was two of them; after watching the one. I watched out so. Thinking I could see it better. When I noticed the one in the direction south."]

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
