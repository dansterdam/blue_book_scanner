Mrs. Hunt/man/SAFGICC/7284e/13 Oct 65

Dear Mr. [redacted]

OCT 13 1965

Reference is made to your report of an aerial object which you observed on the night of 24 August 1965.

The dimensions of the object, horizontal flight of approximately 30 degrees of an arc in three seconds, and the shape comparable to a parachute or hornet's nest are characteristic of an observation of a bird at night.

Although reports of this nature are rare, we do receive an average of four a year.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDESW
SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information, [redacted]

TO: Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)
Wash D C 20330

Reference the attached letter from [redacted] requesting information on his unidentified observation. Form 164 information completed by Mr. [redacted] has given the added information necessary for us to evaluate his sighting of 24 Aug 65.

The dimness of the object, horizontal flight of approximately 30 degrees of an arc in three seconds, and the shape compared to a parachute or hornet's nest lead to an evaluation of the sighting as an observation of a bird. The characteristics of a bird observation at night are similar to those you have given. While reports of this nature are rare, the Air Force does receive three or four a year. The suddenness of the sighting, and the fact that the bird must be far enough away from the observer so that it may be identified as such and yet near enough that light will reflect from its wings and body, make the circumstances sufficiently unusual that malidentification can occur.
