Flying Objects
Seen in
State Skies

Chinook, Montana
5 October 1962

J. Edgar Hoover, Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

The attached newspaper clipping was taken from the Great Falls Montana Tribune of October 8, 1962. This was of interest to me and is one of the hoaxes which has the people baffled.

During this past summer while enroute to Chinook from my farm, which is located 25 miles north of Chinook, I picked up a object or flying object such as this one described in the newspaper article and which appears similar to other reportings.

My discovery can be described as a tear shaped object. It was a small parachute made of light blue colored rubber or plastic material with a small battery attached. Attached to the battery was a small flashlight bulb.

I carried this flying object or flare in my pickup for several days, and when I went to remove it, I found that it was missing.

Flying objects or flares, such as these, could be released from flying aircraft, and when carried by the wind could very well appear to be flying objects or flares.

Informed people know that Rabbi Wise's statement is true - "Some call it Co-communist, I call it Jewish". Our Air Force, like other institutions, and government, is under the control of those having to object would very well be released from air craft in order to keep the people guessing, as other planned happenings are doing.

With best regards, I am

Flying Objects Sighted in State Skies

HELENA (AP) â€” Unidentified flying objects were reported in two widely separated areas of Montana Tuesday night and were linked with a sighting reported at Moses Lake Air Force Base.

The Fergus County sheriff and a curly-haired officer at a Minuteman missile site near Moore in reported an unidentified Boeing Co. object with a blue top and red bottom.

Helena police reported a Rosebud County officer at Avon, southwest of Helena, spotted two distinct objects in the night sky that looked like flares.
