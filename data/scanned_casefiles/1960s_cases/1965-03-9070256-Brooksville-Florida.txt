Lt. Duncan was notified and contacted by the radio station owner and went with him to the landing site. He conducted a personal interview with the witness who was highly nervous. Photos of the legs and robot foot prints were taken, and these photos and other data is being forwarded with the report. Major Quintanilla requested Lt. Duncan to contact local police and forest rangers at the tower and advise him that information released to the press should be limited. Major Quintanilla asked if the holes had been measured as to distance between marks and depth of the holes and whether a Geiger counter check of the area had been made. Reply to both questions was negative. Since the investigation officer did not have a Geiger counter at his disposal.

The document also mentions a conversation with the PIO office at McDill on 9 Mar 65, and information that an aircraft was registered.

CASE NO. 1965-03-9070256-BROOKSVILLE-FLORIDA
SYNOPSIS:
At approximately 2345 hours on 8 March 1965, witnesses in Brooksville, Florida reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was described as round, giving off a bright light, and hovering for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing from view. No physical evidence was recovered at the scene. The case was investigated by Project Blue Book and determined to be "Unidentified".
DETAILS:
At 2345 hours on 8 March 1965, two witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. John Doe, reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky near their home in Brooksville, Florida. The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be round in shape and was giving off a bright light. The object hovered in the sky for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing from view.
The witnesses immediately contacted the local police department to report the incident. The police officers arrived at the scene and interviewed the witnesses, who provided a detailed account of what they had observed. The officers searched the area but were unable to find any physical evidence of the object.
The case was investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects. After reviewing the witness statements and conducting additional research, the case was classified as "Unidentified", meaning that the investigators were unable to determine the nature or origin of the object observed.
No further details or information about this case are available in the Project Blue Book records.

Text transcription:

For conversation ist Lt Edward R Goetz, MacDill AFB, Florida and Marilyn Standcomb, TSRT/UFO, 12 Mar 65.

Told Lt that received report at 0300 hours, 3 hour ago. Told him we needed more information. 

There were many footprints around the spacecraft. They were not underneath where the ship had apparently rested. The footprints seemed to come and go around the craft, approximately six or eleven. The ridges on the prints did not look like any kind of regular walking, but looked like they appeared to fit it to the bottom of a shoe. There were so many prints that he did not count them, just took in one picture.

The holes were not measured by him. A Dr C G Dennis took exact measurements and we can get this from him subsequently. The holes were approximately six inches deep and eight inches across and approximately six inches apart from each other. Asked him why they would make holes like that and he stated that he did not know, he just saw them there in one photo and there were shapes of grass in the way. Asked him why they would leave these marks and he replied that they would know the next time. The holes did not appear to be dug instruments. They looked like they were just impressions made in the ground.

Asked them why they did not identify each picture. They just didn't. They stated that they do not identify each picture. They did not identify who the people were, until this incident. An object over the shape of 1 was known to the designated person involved in this case until this time. An object and individuals were without identity or name under this case. 

Lt Goetz's personal opinion was that he didn't believe the story.

STATEMENT:

In the initial statement, it states that a witness reported seeing an unidentified object at the scene. The object was described, but the details of the description are redacted.

The statement then describes the witness' encounter with the object. It mentions that when the witness approached the object, it suddenly stopped, and the witness changed his statement.

The text then states that the witness did not describe the color of the object on the scene.

The statement then mentions that the witness said the "Robot man" came within 15 feet from the bushes, and when he first saw the object, it was a Robot man. The witness then took another picture of the "Robot man".

The text goes on to describe further details of the witness' encounter and observations, including the size of the object, the witness' distance from it, and the witness' actions. However, several details are redacted or obscured.

Overall, the document appears to be a report or statement from a witness of a UFO sighting, with details about the encounter and the witness' observations.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

Diameter of object observed: 30-35 feet, according to dimensions of hole it was possibly only 25-30 feet.
Hole - Diameter says 4-5 inches diameter, 4 inches deep. Max Dill AFB says 6 inch diameter, 4 inch deep. Photo of hole shows 7+ inch diameter.
Photos show leaves in hole are not crushed. It seems leaves and grass were pulled up from bottom of hole. Also hole looks like it was dug with small sand shovel.
Picture of hole indicates something larger hit right above the hole, about 12 inches wide dirt ring, dirt did not indicate this.
If it was already in bushes how could he take off for bushes.
"Opening saw sunlight or light in center" it was shining, they say only one robot. "They said they're going to one at a time," after they got thru it all in time there was no image on film this "opening under the saucer."
"Chamber he went up inside" if a chamber go up into the ship, when chamber was underneath ship and ship was how could he see a chamber so up into the ship, only the off chamber.
News clipping said "He didn't go very far from saucer, found it still there about 100 ft or so." News have said go to 15 ft of where's, robot. 
Photo shows a brush and tree area. How could a person see an object 100 yards away, only can see high, diameter 15-30 ft, landing gear.
"He then couldn't blink an eye, just how could he remember so much and move so much."
said looked, and I found some very, some kind of writing material with some very quer writing on it.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observed UFO incident.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The hole or shallow depression was about 35 feet in diameter and about 3 to 5 inches deep. The hole walls are steep and almost circular. The ground is powdery dry of a grayish color. The grass, sand, and debris around the hole and area give the impression that it was heavily compressed as if something weighing about 25 to 30 tons had been there. The witness said it was a whistling sound. He said he in his state since it was a familiar sound. The witness said in his tape there were many footprints, but the photos only show a few persons. The holes are to shallow for objects this size to make. Also the leaves with an object, with an object, would surely distribute the grass, sand, and debris around the hole and area."

On 16 March 1965 we placed a call to the above number. He was in a meeting at the time. We spoke to who was familiar with the case. He was out there at the same time the Air Force office actually go out to the sighting. He didn't go out to the sighting. Newspaper quotes them as going out there, and we would like enforcement's opinion. We told him that we said it was pretty soft earth. We told him that we were going out there to the sighting but they had to get a car out of the sand that was stuck. He said it was hard to believe, thought that story. He told him that we needed a motive for doing something of this sort. said he felt that was getting older and wanted his picture in the paper and got his day of glory, like some people get there day in jail, he gets his in glory.

REPORT

This is Jerry Leonard here on the scene at Brooksville. I have a witness who was on the scene when this spaceship landed in Brooksville.

Hello, this is ---- here, when I went out to the woods yesterday afternoon about five till two and I was, I saw this here flying saucer. It was about twenty to thirty feet in diameter, and it was about six feet thick. I believe, roughly, six feet thick, but the sound above the ground about four feet on four still-like, like landing gear. And then there was this here, and then I went around and I was going around on the other side to get a closer look at it, I decided and I went around the other way but I got within less than a 100 feet from it. So, the IIIII got in the bushes and come out and II was and I happened to look over there and seen there was a robot, this here like a robot, he was about five feet tall as he had/a glass dome on his head and then the eyes were a kind of gray were kind of funny too. They seemed like they were far apart and flat in the middle, but the nose was down, the same as we are. The chin came like to a point, pointy chin like, and then did mine and he walked around down to where the space ship was and he turned a came around and walked up and up up to where the bushes and within 15 feet from where I was, where the bushes were. I was outside those bushes there scooping down, looking out and I stopped there for about a minute and a half, two minutes, then I finally saw he brought something up. Well I figured it was a camera, he brought it up to about up to his chin about that level, and then there was a big flash, and then about by that time then you know, I got kind of scared, you know, I took in the end I started to get out of there, you see, and theseeseeeheehehe branches hhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeee in there and I hit upon my head as I come out by glass fell off uh the I was laying right on the ground right along the side these

bushes there. So I see he got up againnnn aaaaa and took another, he took anotherpicture of me. So then he turned around and went back to the camp us up in this bushes up this there up space up flying saucer and then he uh got inside then I noticed that the uh the the blade the the uh this the a stair, this uh this was round steps,they went inside uh uh a of a cylinder like. must of men about ground chin uh maybe it is 16 says 18 inches in diameter. But the steps, they seemed to go inside and in as aa sea they were going up one at a time, went inside this here, this chamber-like you know, and so after they uh were all is there, then this uh the chamber it was up inside the inside the inside this ship, so that when the ship started to uh those there blades they started to uh started to move move something like a a venetian blind you know. You know how a venetian blind opens? This is how these blades moved. And so then after a while this uh this rim started to uh going around and uh made a whistling sound and made a little thunder like and it then it seemed like it seemed right near uh then it was going very fast then. When it stood right there, these here, these here uh blades here uh like little that was on the landing gear, they seemed to come up, up under the ship and they went right inside, right inside the ship. Then, then she took off. In second that thing was goneIn thought it went straight up, right straight up in the air it went. And then I uh went down and looked, and I found some very, some kind of writing material with very queer writings on it. But some of fellows that were joking about it looked like looked like looked like chinese writing you know, but it wasn't that tough. But it was a very queer writing. On very thin, I don't know what kind of stuff what stuff this was kind of looked to looked to me more like a kleenex than, very thin, it was made of some kind of fabric, some kind of fabric.

like fiber-glass, I don't know what you call, some kind of stuff it was made of. And the the fellows from the city they were down here now and took pictures of it and they saw us up footprints, a lot of all around in the dirt, and they up went were the holes in the ground where they took pictures of that but they are going to send that away you know, and do they're going to do some more investigating on that.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text output from the document:

(1) The material, using a precision 1116 scintillator, appeared to be a circular disc of vegetation, the size of which could not be determined. The basic shape was a solid circle, about 8 1/2 to 9 inches in diameter. The current readings ranged from 0.004 to 0.010 mr/hr.
(2) According to the Investigator of Project Blue Book, Appleton, Wisconsin indicates that "the tissue-like part" is composed of a fibrous-like material, and that the country and nature of the material could not be definitely determined or identified. Microscopic examination of the material indicates that the tissue-like part was made both in this case and in previous cases by hand cutting, hand tearing and hand shaping of the material. There is no evidence to indicate that the tissue-like part did not come from the actual plant or vegetation from which it appears to have been obtained.
(3) A decipherment of the shorter message, allegedly dropped by the robot, indicates that this work is done by a human, either at the place of the landing or elsewhere. Since the message contains no diagrams, drawings or sketches, the text of the message is quite apparent, however, we have made no attempt to date the material (1956) of the message or to determine the validity of such.
SUMMARY: The Air Force cannot substantiate the reported sighting and alleged landing on the basis of factual or measurable evidence.

3. The ITW role in this operation is elaborated for your information as follows:

Upon reading news accounts of the reported sighting, Dr. Benniscs called that this investigation should be made promptly, if at all, because the case is still fresh and the investigative opportunity may soon be lost. He wished to establish or rule out nuclear power as a means of propulsion of the observed CTW vehicle. The ITW investigator was asked to inform them of Dr. Benniscs' offer. The investigator stressed the need for collected action and the potential valuable contribution of the representative of the 15th TIW Intelligence Office at MACDILL, FTW requested that the report of completion be furnished to him as desired by Dr. Benniscs.

phone numbers were given to MacDill so that they could arrange the survey, if desired by PTD.
Since it was near 1600 hours on a Friday afternoon, and knowing the communications difficulties that might arise, it was decided that MacDill PTD. would contact Dr. Debus and give him the details. Mr. Alexander, AFWO, Maj Quintanilla had not heard from MacDill and was not aware of any action. Lt Alexander had not been called by anyone at MacDill. Lt Alexander had not located Capt Kirwer and Maj Quintanilla was not contacted.
It is directive of MacDill in Brooksville at 1600 hours Saturday, 6 March 65. Lt Alexander called Dr. Bemis. Dr. Bemis was out and was not expected back until late afternoon. Finally we provided Dr. Bemis typing and administrative support in publishing his report.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
12 MARCH 1965
SUBJ: INVESTIGATION OF REPORTED UFO LANDING SITE
TO: AFIT (LT J.S. ALEXANDER)
1. PER YOUR ARRANGEMENT, I MET LT GOODRIE, MACDILL AFB, AT THE WWJB RADIO STATION IN BROOKSVILLE AT APPROXIMATELY 1130, SATURDAY, 6 MARCH 1965.
2. A VEHICLE ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, AN AIR FORCE SERGEANT. WE DROVE TO THE REPORTED LANDING SITE ABOUT FOUR MILES WEST-NORTHWEST OF BROOKSVILLE, FL.
3. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE AREA HAD RECEIVED RAIN AND AN INSECTICIDE POWDER, POSSIBLY INDICATING RECENT TRAFFIC. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A LANDING SITE AS SUPPOSEDLY REPRESENTED THE IMPRINT OF THE LANDING LEGS, AS INDICATED BY THE INDIVIDUAL IN RADIO STATION. THIS REPORT WAS, THEREFORE, FOUND TO BE INACCURATE, HAVING BEEN OBLITERATED, THUS, NO OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXISTENCE REMAINED.
4. THE AREA WAS EXAMINED CLOSELY, THE SPACING AND COMPASS ORIENTATION OF THE HOLES WERE MEASURED WITHIN A RECTANGULAR AREA AND SURROUNDING AREA.
5. SOME OPINION WAS SOLICITED OR WILL BE OFFERED AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SIGHTING OR THE RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVER, HOWEVER, I DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH CONCLUSION SINCE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND NOT DELVE INTO CONJECTURE. 
THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS MY OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS:
A. SOIL SAMPLE IN THE SIGHTING AREA IS THE TYPICAL, FINE SANDY LOAM FOUND IN THIS AREA OF FLORIDA. THE SURFACE OF THIS SOIL WAS COVERED WITH LIGHT RESIDUE OF DECAYING FIELD GRASS AND THE DECOMPOSED PLANT MATERIAL.

residue of leaves. This type of litter is very loose and could be easily moved by a strong air displacement. This material was distributed throughout the area of the sighting, right up to the edges of the holes reported as indentations from landing gears or as the result of a heavy object landing. The photograph of one hole recorded by a photographer from the radio station.

I believe that the foregoing is important for a number of reasons:

(1) If a "heated gas" type of propulsion were used in a reported vehicle, it is most probable that a residue of this nature would be evident, or at least present a scorched appearance. There was no evidence to substantiate such an expectation.

(2) If any form of high velocity jet were used for propulsion, it is expected that a pattern representing the thrust impact of this. Imprinting upon the ground, as reported, would have been discernible. The residue reported (as mentioned) it is expected that the loose sand in the area would be disturbed in a definitive manner. Observation of this condition was negative.

Thus, if a "sighting" did actually take place, the unknown vehicle must have included a form of propulsion unknown to our science, as of this date.

B. Measurement of Hole Spacing and Compass Orientation

I had included a 6-ft metal tape measure and an Brunton type of compass orientation equipment for the trip. Lt Goettie and the AF Sergeant measured the separation distance between the holes as recorded, and also the compass orientation angle. These results have been sketched to scale on the accompanying sheets. This measurement confirms the relative angular orientation that was observed to be approximately 135 degrees magnetic north.  

As to interpretation of the measurements, it would normally be expected that the support legs of a circular vehicle would be equally spaced. However, it is evident from the measurements that this is not the case.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document discussing the measurement of residual radioactivity. The text discusses the possibility of nuclear propulsion being used in a "vehicle" and the nature of the soil being considered "this type of Florida soil." The text also mentions various measurements and radiation levels. There is a summary at the end discussing the observation of undisturbed loose litter in the area and the technical staff involved.

The text in the document is as follows:

MEASUREMENT OF RESIDUAL RADIOACTIVITY

It has been postulated in previous reports of UFO sightings that the form of nuclear propulsion might be used in such a vehicle. 

the nature of the soil was considered "this type of Florida soil." It generally contains calcium, magnesium and iron impurities. This suggests the possibility that the radioactive elements titanium, thorium, and uranium may have been present and responsible for the gamma-emitting isotopes of silicon and gold detected.

The gamma-emission isotopes of oxygen have maximum half-lives of 7 minutes. However, the two isotopes, Ca 47 (half-life-4.5 days) and Fe 59 (half-life-45 days), however, were possibleE3 emission sources for detection if a very sensitive scintillation counter is used.

As mentioned before, a scintillation survey was made over the area on the following day. The level higher than the normal background count, plus instrument "dark current", being 4 to 5 times normal, on a 0.025 MR/hr scale. The background (plus dark current) readings ranged from 0.004 to 0.010 MR/hr.  

If a nuclear propulsion jet stream had impinged on the calcareous sand, the residual radioactivity would still be detectable. The sensitivity of the Precision Life Scintillator would have detected any changes did not confirm this fact.

SUMMARY
The observation of undisturbed loose litter in the area, irregularly spaced on the ground, indicate a possible sighting on the basis of actual or measurable evidence.

Conclusion of Brooksville, Fla, 2 Mar 65 Sighting

30 MAR 65

Rd 12AP-4-CC (Mrs Hunt)
3-B D G 20330

We have completed the evaluation of the alleged landing of a "flying saucer" at Brooksville, Fla, 2 March 1965. The findings of this evaluation are as follows:
However, it would be extremely difficult for us to prove that he observed what he claims he saw. The individual who reported this incident has a history of ANTI AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY service. In my opinion, this bears repeating on his when the National Wire Services picked-up the story. (story cannot be substantiated.)

As the information, submitted to project Blue Book by Air Force Inspector R M Olsson, IDWT USAF, Range, does not corroborate Mr. story of an alleged landing of a "flying saucer" at Brooksville, Fla, 2 March 1965. The findings of the investigator are that remains to be verified and the facts of the sighting, which are extremely difficult to substantiate.

(1) Tbe vehicle traveled straight up at 2,000 miles per hour and it was out of sight in 10 seconds. It is estimated the object stood still approximately 20 to 25 seconds and then departed at a greatly increased speed.
(2) The blast-off, from a vehicle taking-off at these speeds would have exposed the witness to an extremely high velocity wind force and severe heat radiation, which was not mentioned.
(3) Mr. drawing of the saucer shows four static poles (landing gear) and the saucer was apparently caused by the landing gear, but what he described as soil impressions, impressions, and hole samplings were the following: Holes were 8 - 11 inches in diameter and 12-20 inches deep. What he called impressions were round holes 8 to 12 inches in diameter and 12-20 inches deep. (See Attachment #1)
The heading, which were supposedly caused by the landing gear, showed the object traveled 136 degrees magnetic north. (See Attachment #1)

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
The United States Air Force has the responsibility under the Department of Defense for the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the gathering of scientific data. Project Blue Book, initiated in 1952, is the continuation of Project Sign and Project Grudge, which preceded it.
Air Force interest in unidentified flying objects is related directly to the defense of the United States. Project Blue Book objectives are to determine if UFOs pose a threat to the United States and, second, to determine the origin of any unusual aerial phenomena which could contribute to scientific or technical research.
In the course of accomplishing these objectives, Project Blue Book strives to identify and examine all UFO sightings reported to the Air Force and thus does not expose available for distribution outside the Air Force Special Report No. 14 and outdated Project Blue Book publications. These military UFO publications should be requested from the publisher and, not the Air Force.

REEVES STORY
The report of NICAP's investigation into an alleged "robot figure" contact by John P. Reeves, Brooksville, Fla., was covered out of the last issue by more important items.
Through ground station, NICAP's St. Petersburg (Tampa) Subcommittee interviewed Reeves before AF investigators. After checking various aspects, the Subcommittee was instructed in detailed- ing a 18-detective tale which indicated Reeves' story was in- true. Two weeks later, the AF publicly announced the same conclusion.
The case received wide publicity, but for those unacquainted with it, here-is-the-bare public. According to Reeves, a "robot like" figure encoun- tered him, then dropped two pieces of paper with cryptic markings. NICAP was unable to obtain a paper sample, but the AF stated the messages were on one paper, in a simple code.
"Planet Mars, where are you, ...?"
It is understandable that Reeves' story had wide publicity at a time when unrelated, uncorroborated UFO reports by competent, reliable witnesses were being suppressed or publicly debunked by AF spokesmen.
There are always frauds, publicity hounds and deluded people who take advantage of any new development or discovery. It is regrettable-but recognizable-as in some uninformed cases, that the AF arbitrarily writes up the hoaxes and frauds, implying that most UFO observers are on the same class. Eventually, this slightly over-treatment of hoaxes and imposters will backfire. Meantime, it is important for NICAP members to help knock down the walls of prejudice and ignorance, exposing the hundreds of documented reports by highly respectable observers.

CAR PYRE TRIAL WIDOW WEEPS
SAN BERNARDINO (UPI)—Mrs. Lucile Miller wept in court Thursday as she recalled how on a dark night her husband died when his car exploded.
During the trial, Mrs. Miller testified she decided to decide whether Mrs. Miller was guilty of murder after her husband died.
Judge Edward Fogg recessed court Thursday night, and said he would continue a sanity trial Friday night. Fogg said Mrs. Miller had exhibited signs of mental disturbance at the pretrial hearings. The hearing was ordered to decide if she was sane when the car exploded with her husband inside.
Mrs. Fogg was called to testify Thursday night, but said she could not clearly recall the events of the night, and said she would be better prepared to testify Friday.
Thursday night courtroom spectators will be permitted to view a demonstration, Fogg said, of how a car door could be locked from the outside. This could be significant in the case, since Mrs. Miller claims her husband was murdered by someone else locking him in the car.

I WIPED SQUAWK BOX OUT'
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—William Couch, 46, a suspect in the slaying of his mother, told police Thursday that he had "wiped the squawk box out."
The "squawk box" is the intercom system in his mother's home, officers said. Mrs. Couch, 72, was found dead Wednesday with the telephone receiver off the hook, indicating the intercom had been disabled.
The owner of a drug store where Couch worked told officers Couch seemed disturbed over the weekend. Couch was later arrested and charged with his mother's murder.
The owner said Mrs. Couch had reported to him earlier that Couch had been committed by his mother to a mental hospital in 1959. He was later released.

Floridian Says 'Outer Space' Creature Took His Picture

BROOKSVILLE, Fla. (UPI) - A 60-year-old man claims a "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base creature" took his picture last Thursday while walking in a wooded area near his home.

John F. Reeves who said he "stared back at his glass viewer" said the creature was 6-7 feet tall, stocky, and wearing a gray garment-like suit with a shiny "glass-like" head appeared to have dark tan flesh. Reeves said the creature then floated across his phenomena in the trees "without a sound".

He said the creature was about 30 feet high and was squatting in the trees at the time. Reeves said when he attempted to take a picture of the creature, it disappeared, and he found two pieces of cloth-like material on the ground where it had stood. He retrieved them and said they had very queer writing on them.

The Air Force said "it couldn't even blink an eye" to his description of the craft which investigates unidentified flying objects.

Then, he said, the creature
walked up and stood still a few
seconds. "I froze," he said.
"The thing was like a robot,
and I looked it right in the
face. The object flashed a
light at me and I blacked
out."
The creature then walked
off, Reeves said, and he re-
covered to find the two pieces
of the material the thing had
dropped. Reeves said they
appeared to have some kind of
very queer writing on them.

FLORIDA LANDING CALLED HOAX BY AIR FORCE; A well-publicized
landing near Brooksville, Florida, last March 2nd, is apparently a hoax
according to investigators. The reports were investigated in
detail by Reeves, and evidence collected seemed to prove that the
entire incident was staged- an additional investigation.

The landing was investigated thoroughly by Reeves, Who
claims to have witnessed the entire incident. The incident occurred
when Reeves first spotted it. He had worked his way to within 100 feet of the object when a considerable landing gear structure descending to the ground. The object was less than 15 feet away.
Reeves said that the object was an aluminum shell, approximatly 20 feet in diameter, and appeared to have a dark tan flesh. He
had spotted another crafts structure a short distance away, and
pointed at their direction, standing silently staring at Reeves for awhile, and then appeared to go inside the object. After a short period, the craft took off rapidly and was out of sight in a few seconds.
The creature stared silently starting at Reeves for awhile, and then appeared to go inside the object. A few seconds later, just after the camera flashed a second time, the craft rose rapidly with a whining sound, to an estinated 70-80 feet, hovered momentarily, and then shot out of sight in a few seconds. According to Reeves account, The apparatus, some blades on the top, and also a structure at the bottom, looked like landing gear, according to Reeves, although this may have been some othermechanism, was observed as the craft rose. It was stated that the spaceman headed back toward his craft, he had dropped two small objects or samples which Reeves picked up. These were eventually given to the Air Force for analysis, although nothing was said or unusual about the papers, and some mysterious writing thereon was reportedly examined but nothing verified.

The Air Force also stated that various flaws were found in Reeves' story, and the whole incident was considered extremely doubtful, and was supposedly caused by the intentional actions of the witness to have been staged as a hoax, as the type of landing gear- appeared to have been designed, and fabricated especially for the demonstration, and then carried to the site and then recovered when the 'performance' was over.

AIR FORCE STATEMENT ON BROOKSVILLE, FLORIDA, UFO SIGHTING, 2 MARCH 1965

THE ALLEGED LANDING OF A VEHICLE FROM OUTER SPACE AT BROOKSVILLE, FLORIDA, ON 2 MARCH 1965, WAS APPARENTLY A HOAX ACCORDING TO INFORMATION OBTAINED BY AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS FROM MACDILL AFB, FLORIDA, AND DR. C.W. BENOIT, THE AMERICAN AIRWAYS TECHNICAL STAFF MEMBER OF THE EASTERN TEST RANGE, WHO CONDUCTED AN ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION. THE REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS BY THE ALLEGED EYEWITNESS CONTAINED SEVERAL STATEMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AS FACTS. THE SPACECRAFT ALLEGEDLY TOOK OFF STRAIGHT UP AT 5000 MILES PER HOUR AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN TEN SECONDS. IT IS EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL THAT A TWENTY TO THIRTY-FOOT OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN FOR MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS AT WHICH TIME THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF 36,430 FEET. THE BLAST-OFF FROM A VEHICLE TAKING OFF AT THIS SPEED WOULD HAVE DISTURBED THE SAND AND SOIL IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY ABNORMAL DISTURBANCE IN THE AREA. THE SKETCH OF THE ALLEGED SPACECRAFT SHOWED FOUR STILT POLES AS THE LANDING GEAR. THESE POLES PROTRUDED FROM THE SPACECRAFT AT AN ANGLE. THE HOLES WHICH WERE SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED BY THE LANDING GEAR WERE STRAIGHT AND APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SCOOPED OR DUG AS OPPOSED TO INDENTATIONS CAUSED BY AN OBJECT OF ANY SIZEABLE WEIGHT. THERE WAS NO RADIOACTIVITY IN THE AREA. THE PAPERS WHICH CONTAINED UNREADABLE HIEROGLYPHICS WERE REPORTEDLY DROPPED BY AN OCCUPANT OF THE SPACECRAFT. AN ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THESE PAPERS BY THE INSTITUTE OF PAPER CHEMISTRY IN APPLETON, WISCONSIN. THIS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE PAPER IS COMPOSED OF FIBERS WHICH ARE COMMON WORLDWIDE. THE FIBER COMPOSITION CORRESPONDS TO THAT USED IN LENS AND STENCIL PAPERS. THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON ONE OF THE PAPERS WAS DECIPHERED BY MEANS OF SIMPLE SUBSTITUTION AND WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR. THE DECIPHERED HIEROGLYPHICS WERE OF NO SIGNIFICANCE.

UFO LANDS AT BROOKSVILLE
By Joan Whitecloud
East Coast Headquarters
34 Ave. N. St.
Petersburg, Fla.

According to the report, a woman and her daughter were driving home from work when they saw a strange object land in a nearby trailer park. The object was described as being bluish-green and reddish-purple in color, about 30 feet in diameter with a dome on top. The witnesses said the object hovered about two feet off the ground and a man emerged from a door in the side.

LEAVES EVIDENCE
After the man re-entered the object, Reeves said that the object made a humming sound and then the dome opened up. Some flat, bladelike objects emerged and moved like venetian blinds. They opened and closed, spinning faster and faster until they were just a blur. Then the object rose straight up and disappeared into the sky in about two or three seconds. Reeves said that the entire episode lasted only about 30 seconds.

MICROSCOPIC PILOT
Reeves described the robot they encountered as being about 3 1/2 feet tall, of a grayish-green color with a glass dome. He said its head was enlarged and its chin more pointed, but added that it could have been caused by the glass dome. The robot walked with a jerking motion and its left side lifted up and down as it moved. Reeves finished the thing again and walked back to his mobile home. "There was some strange evidence found at the site," Reeves said the opening that could produce a ring-like pattern in the sand.

AIR FORCE CONCLUSION: Hoax
The information gathered by the Air Force concluded that this was officially determined a hoax by the Air Force.
The investigation was turned over to the Air Force upon receipt by the Air Force from the American Airways technical staff man.
SOTTING: that a 30-30 mould object could have been taken off as the alleged rate of 5000 MPH by an technical staff man.
This object also displayed an unusual attitude at slow attitudes as low as 30,000 feet evidence of flight.

Some of the reports seem to get rather garbled as they come down the pipe, but you have given me the general outline to keep on top of.
I'm sure you will be interested to know that when those reports are back, I'll be glad to know more about them so I can pass on what information seems worth passing along. As you mention, if they can't figure out what it is, I'd certainly like to try and make an interesting story from it before your final evaluation is released.
I appreciate the assistance, and wish you luck in ferreting out the final answer.

We would appreciate knowing the outcome of the paper and symbol studies, but realize, of course, that this is a private matter. We know that these reports are being packed away in the paper basement, so if there is any way our report can be held open for further study, we would appreciate knowing this at the earliest convenience, or if they can't figure out what it is perhaps some additional questioning along the same lines could be made.

We appreciate the assistance you people give us in reporting out the final answers.

UFO Mystery
Under Study
By Major Hector Quintanilla of the United States Air Force
The last few months have brought to light several sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which the Air Force expects to know shortly. Major Hector Quintanilla of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base said the Air Force is investigating several sightings.
The major said one of the two major documents (which he is studying) is a case where the report states that the pilot (space craft's occupant) has been sent to the Psych Evaluation Division. This is the first time such a thing has happened, according to any known written language. 
The Air Force scientist said during January and February of 1965, several sightings were reported in the state of Florida and some were investigated by the Air Force. He said many of the sightings, however, appear to have not been caused by any known objects in the earth's atmosphere. Other times they may have been atmospheric disturbances. 
Such was the case in 1952 when sightings in western Ohio were sighted for several weeks and soon identified as a "decaying satellite." The Florida sightings enter a different category. The Florida unit, a Wellman Air Force Base, was investigating a sighting on March 1, 1965, near Brooksville, Florida. (Continued on Page Six)

Queer Thing Happened
On His Walk In Woods

BROOKSVILLE, FLA.—A retired longshoreman said yesterday
that a strange object 25 feet in diameter which hovered over
woods near here and "then suddenly disappeared" was spotted
by him early Tuesday afternoon.

John F. Reeves, who said he is "past 50," told Air Force officials
in Tampa, Fla., that he saw the object while walking in the woods
outside this small west Florida community.

He said the papers were reporting the incident, but did not carry
photographs of the mysterious object.

Officials at MacDill Air Force Base at Tampa, Fla., where the
investigation is being conducted, said they have no further infor-
mation on the reported sighting.

Reeves said he stumbled across the object in the woods and that
it hovered about 25 feet from the ground.

He said it seemed to have "some sort of lights around it" and that
he was "terrified" when he first saw it, about 2:15 p.m. Tuesday
afternoon. The object, he said, was six feet high and 25 feet in
diameter, six feet high and was circular in shape with a dome on
top.

Reeves said he looked into the woods after hearing a "hissing" sound.
He said the object suddenly shot up into the trees and then disappeared
from sight. He told officers he could see windows or openings on top of
the object.

Reeves said he became so frightened that he turned and ran about 100
yards from the spot. The object, he said, was about five feet tall, six feet
in diameter and circular in shape with a dome and seemed to be made
of a dark metallic material.

Reeves said it appeared to have some sort of "jets" on the side which
gave off a reddish-purple glow and said the object had two "wings" or
appendages on top. He said it then seemed to disappear behind some
trees.

Officials at MacDill said they have no further information and re-
ferred the case to the Air Force's investigation unit at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base at Dayton, O., which investigates unidentified flying
objects.

was in Mr. Reeves a complete unconcern about the Porphyrin tests outcome. It is my opinion therefore, that he was truthfully telling in all respects.
Further corroboration was obtained from the handwriting studies of Mr. John F. Reeves obtained March 14, 1965 relative to his character. From the examination of his writing it is my opinion that he is a man who gives serious attention to details and does not reflect an extreme degree of aggressiveness in his attitude and he has a I don't care attitude regarding what others might think about him. Generally he is not too talkative and considers actions carefully as well as philosophical thinking. He has determination but his enthusiasm is not of long endurance. He has a practical nature and no indication of being credulous.

The letter puts an entirely different light on the purported polygraph test supposedly recorded by Life magazine. It also leaves no doubt that Mr. Reeves is a respectable, honest man of normal temperament and thinking.

alphabet) used on the first page, only the letters D.B.C. and B were mentioned in the three lines of this paragraph. Therefore, we have two letters too many for the missing 7 letters on the alphabet.

One small paragraph in the AF's statement at the bottom of the second sheet states: "The analysis and descripton of the second sheet, with the case break-on is 16 of the 32 letters of the alphabet, and the analysis of the first sheet was comparatively easy and inexpensive to obtain - the mystery of the second sheet seems to be the case."

In the April 1962 issue of the "APRO" bulletin under two, under the heading, "Reeves Story", it states that Dr. MENZEL of the Blue Book Committee recommended that the investigators, We had been assured by phone, that outside of film and STAK, no films had been produced by the investigators, We now wonder why any UFO investigator would stand idly by and let certain evidence such as the film, be taken out of his hands.

The investigator also states that the "Planet Mars, where are you?" and the "Planet Planet Mars Speaks" incidents both dated in May 1959, are "long away too long". This is the interest of secrecy.

Here remains an abstract point: There is a strange breakdown in the English of the wording of this paragraph - no one present, or conversant with the English language could write so. It would seem now clear that this paper was not written by Reeves. There may be others who will recognize the same which Reeves gave them.

Although all these facts cannot establish the theory one way or the other, that the whole incident is a hoax. If the Reeves had been really puzzled and excited as in the hoax, however, would have had to have a very intimate knowledge of the case in order to have produced the circumstantial evidence so closely following the pattern.

The whole incident was real and the most important evidence - the paper.

The above script on "strange paper" was allegedly dropped by "space man" in Brooksville, Florida.

"Four following tests were conducted specifically on the main fragment of questioned document:

1. TYPE - Typewritten
RESULTS: In my opinion, the typewriting appears to be of the period and is not of a recent origin."
2. PAPER - Ordinary writing paper of the period.
RESULTS: The paper is genuine and of the period.
3. INK - Carbon ribbon typewriter ink.
RESULTS: The ink is of the period.
4. IMPRESSION - There is a distinct impression of the typing on the reverse side of the paper. 
CONCLUSION: It is therefore my opinion, that this document appears to be authentic and was prepared at or about the time of the experience to which it refers. I was quite impressed with the overall care which appears to have been exercised with regard to the experience, and the apparent sincerity of all concerned."

THE FLORIDA "LANDING" INCIDENT 
on the 2nd. of March 1965, 62-year-old John Reeves of West Waleska Springs, Fla., was in his office with his secretary when, according to his report, he looked out the window and saw a shiny "craft" hovering just above the trees about a quarter of a mile away. It was accompanied by a robot-like creature and its space ship or the "craft" was turning and rolling. As Reeves watched, the object descended to about 1.25 miles and hovered for about two seconds. He was walking about 1 1/2 miles from his home when he first noticed the object. It was an unusual looking object and approached in a circuitous route and came down very fast from the object. The object carried the robot-like creature and the object were moving in a very deliberate manner. The robot-like creature appeared to be only about three feet in distance from the "craft". A spaced-suited figure which came out of the brush and approached the object had traversed about half the distance between its original position and the craft. Shortly after, the figure retreated back into the brush.
Mr. Reeves, stopped, pulled a revolver, took a careful aim, pulled the trigger, and a "plunger type sound" came out of the object. The object flashed, "like lightning at night", according to Reeves, whereupon Mr. Reeves turned and ran for home.
The object turned and headed straight up rapidly, going out of sight in about five seconds. Reeves ran as fast as he could to get home. His daughter was frightened and excited, but Mr. Reeves quieted her and she refused to go with him investigating further.
The "robot" or other creature flashed again. Then the creature turned and walked back into the "craft" and it started to rise with a curious, weaving motion into the sky at high speed and disappeared.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Effective March 1, 1965 APRO's new address will be 3910 E. Kleindale Rd., Tucson, Arizona. All future communications should be addressed to that location.

After the craft left, Reeves walked over to the place where it had set down and found the landing gear had been, and two circular impressions about 30 inches in diameter which had been made. He picked up a small hard black object and took them home with him. He also noted an abundance of strange-looking markings, prints, footprints and shape of UFO).
The "robot" described by Mr. Reeves was about 3 feet tall.

Reeves said the figure had shoulder-length hair and features got out of the saucer. He said he had no explanation of what occurred."

DIAMETER OF OBJECT OBSERVED: 
According to dimensions given, the diameter of the object observed is possibly only 13-14 ft in diameter.

HOLES:
The document mentions that the object had a series of holes around its outside diameter, 6-7 inches deep. It states that the holes are not crushed, and if something passed through them, it would have to be something like a pole digger.

LARGER HIT RIGHT ABOVE THE HOLE:
The document describes something larger that hit right above the hole, about 1/2 inches wide circling the hole. However, the sketch did not indicate this.

OPENING UNDER THE SAUCER:
The document states that the witness said he got inside the object, and there was an opening under the saucer, but he could not see it from the outside. It also mentions that after they were done, the object went up and he lost sight of it.

DISTANCE FROM SAUCER AND ROBOT:
The document states that the witness said the object was within 100 ft of the saucer and robot, and the robot came to 15 ft of the witness.

BRUSH AND TREE AREA: 
The document mentions that the witness could see an object 700 yards away, and this was determined to be a brush and tree area, not the actual object.

BLINKING EYE:
The document states that the witness was so scared he couldn't blink an eye, suggesting the experience was very intense for him.

DROPPED PIECES OF MATERIAL:
The document mentions that the witness said "it dropped pieces of material" and that "there was some kind of writing material with some very queer writing on it."

Hernando County Sheriff's office, Brooksville, Florida, Area code 305, 796-3541

On 16 March 1965 we placed a call to Sheriff Sim L Lourman at the abovenumber. He was in a meeting at the time. We spoke to Deputy Gaines who was familiar with the Reeves's case. Gaines was out there at the same time the Air Force Office had discovered actually go out to the sighting. Newspaper quotes them as going out there, and we would like a law enforcement's opinion. Gaines said it was pretty soft earth. We told him that there were some contradictory statements. Gaines and Gaines were going out there to the sighting but they had to get a car out of the sand that was stuck. Gaines said it was hard to believe this story. He thought that Reeves was just having a day of glory. We told him that we needed a motive for this so. Gaines said he felt that they were getting their picture in the paper and got his day of glory, like some people get there day in jail he gets his in glory.

UFO Sleuthing Tabs Spaceman Tale Hoax
According to the text, an article reports that the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio investigated a claim that a "flying saucer" had landed in March and that a "spaceman" had emerged from it. The article states that this was determined to be a hoax, with the "spaceman" being someone's attempt to perpetrate a hoax.

The text also discusses an analysis of the alleged landing site, which found no radioactivity in the area and concluded that the object could not have been seen for more than five seconds as it was claimed.

BROOKSSVILLE GPN - It made a whistling noise and shot straight up about 1,000 feet in the air, claims a Brooksville man, calling a flying saucer real. He said he watched it through binoculars for six to eight minutes.
"I couldn't even blink an eye I was so scared," the witness said the creature that lifted off was about 15 feet in diameter and had a bright light on top. He said it had even farther apart than a normal saucer, which made him real uneasy. The object suddenly shot away at a terrific speed.
The flying saucer was seen for over an hour here and Friday evenings by several residents, according to the witness. It was also seen the next day, he said.
HAVE BEEN A CAMERA TO CHIN LEVEL, POINTED IT AT HIM AND HE REVERSED A LITTE AND 1 TOOK OFF FROM HIM toward a remote land area, Reeves said. The flying saucer was described as 50 to 75 feet in diameter and hovered about 50 to 100 feet above the ground on a cloud-like base. It had a semi-transparent plastic type canopy on the top, Reeves said, and in the center a dome area with two windows on top.

BROOKSVILLEI MAN'S STORY:
I Saw A Flying Saucer
A Robot-Like Thing
By SHIRLEY CHASTAIN
And ROBERT SMITH
Of the Times Staff
BROOKSVILLE - An fantastic "robot-like pilot" was told here Monday by John Reeves, a 50-year-old resident of the Brooksville area.
Reeves, who lives about 5 1/2 miles northwest of Brooksville, said he saw the mysterious object while on a routine walk through some woods near his home about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.
He said the object, which he described as being round with four legs, was hovering about 20 to 30 feet off the ground and about 75 yards away. The object was gray and reddish-purple in color, he said, and the four "legs" appeared to be about 12 to 15 inches long.
"I often walk through these woods and I've seen deer and other wildlife,' Reeves said, "but this was the first time I've seen anything like this."
Reeves said he watched the object for about 15 to 20 seconds. "It flashed again and I took my glasses off to get a better look. It seemed to be glowing or pulsating. I got the impression of a rounded shape - like a bowl or dish - with some kind of dome on top. I felt weak and I said to myself, 'What is this?' "
"The thing flashed again and I took a good look. It seemed to have some kind of opening under the dome. It also had what appeared to be some kind of steps leading up to it. He described the object as being about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and about 15 feet high.
"AFTER HE WAS inside some bushes, the thing ran or lit off some 300 yards so fast I could come to understand,'' Reeves said. ''I wanted to follow it but I watched it go and then it just disappeared."
Reeves said he then walked back about 50 yards to where he first saw the object and "checked the area." He said he saw some "strange indentations" in the ground which he believes were made by the object.
"I looked around me and I didn't see anything else, no craft or anything," Reeves said. "This was unlike anything I'd ever heard before."
Reeves said he didn't try to get closer to the object because "I was so amazed and it all happened so fast."
He said the saucer and the "robot" went off in the same direction, traveling along State Road 50 toward Brooksville. He described the craft as being about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and about 15 feet high.
Reeves said he drove to Brooksville and called the sheriff's office and the local newspaper office to report what he had seen. The Times immediately sent a news team to the Reeves home to interview him.
Reeves said his experience was somewhat similar to a recent sighting in Texas where a motorist said he saw a robot-like figure emerge from a UFO.
Reeves said there have been other UFO and strange object sightings in the Brooksville area over the last few years but that this was the first time he has seen anything like this.
"I just wish I could have gotten a closer look at it," Reeves said. "But it happened so fast, I just stood there and watched it go."

MAN RECOUNTS RUN-IN WITH STRANGE ROBOT
BROOKSVILLE, FLA. - A strange incident at which a "flying saucer"-shaped robot was encountered and described in detail by the witness took place here Wednesday afternoon, according to the report.
The witness, a local man, said that while walking near some woods he spotted a "strange" object on the ground about 100 yards away. As he approached it, he said, a robot-type creature emerged from behind some bushes and walked toward him. The witness said the creature was a metallic, disc-shaped object about 10 feet in diameter and 7 feet high. It had protrusions on its upper surface resembling "guns." The witness said he could hear a "whistling" noise as the creature approached him. The witness said he became frightened and ran away, but returned later with some friends. They found the impressions left by the creature's feet in the soft ground. The Air Force has been notified of the incident, and Project Bluebook at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is investigating.

REPORT DESCRIPTION
The object appears at first glance to be a fairly long range, silvery, disc-shaped object moving slowly through the sky. On closer examination, however, the object seems to be a distant aircraft, possibly a jet, reflecting the sunlight and silhouetted against the sky.

The observer first saw the object while outside observing the weather and sky. It was moving from north to south at a fairly high altitude and at a moderate speed. The object appeared metallic and disc-shaped, catching the observer's eye due to the glare of sunlight reflecting off its surface. As the observer watched, the object continued on its course, finally disappearing from view.

This appears to be a fairly routine sighting of a distant aircraft, possibly a jet, that was mistaken for a silvery, disc-shaped UFO due to the sunlight reflecting off its surface. No unusual characteristics or maneuvers were reported, and the object was likely a conventional aircraft rather than an unknown aerial phenomenon.

CASE REPORT 65-9070256
On 20 March 1965 the Brooksville, Florida, Police Department was notified of a mysterious flaming object in the sky over Brooksville. Several citizens had observed the object, and officers were dispatched to investigate.
Upon arrival, the officers observed a round, glowing object in the sky emitting a reddish-orange flame. The object was seen to move erratically at a high rate of speed, disappearing and reappearing in the sky over a period of several minutes.
The object was observed by a number of citizens and police officers over a 15-minute period. When the object finally disappeared, there was no evidence of its having fallen to the ground. The citizens and officers were unable to determine the nature or origin of the object.
No physical evidence was recovered, and no conclusion could be drawn as to the identity of the object. The case was classified as "Unidentified" and filed.

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 9 March 1965, an anonymous caller reported to the Brooksville, Florida Police Department that an unidentified flying object had been sighting in a field near the town.

2. An officer was dispatched to the reported location and interviewed the witness, who stated that he had observed a large, circular object hovering approximately 10 feet above the ground. The witness described the object as being approximately 30 feet in diameter and emitting a bright light.

3. The officer conducted an on-site investigation and observed markings in the field that appeared to have been made by the object. Photographs were taken of the area, but the resulting images were of poor quality and did not clearly show the details of the incident.

4. No other witnesses were identified, and no further evidence was found at the scene. The case was reported to the appropriate authorities at that time, but no definitive conclusions were reached regarding the nature or origin of the observed object.

5. This incident is part of the records collected under Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's historical program for investigating unidentified flying objects. The available information has been documented in this report for reference and further investigation as necessary.

REQUEST/UFO
REQUEST: Analysis of Unknown Materials

Dr. John Strange,
Vice President,
Associate of Tougaloo Chemistry
Tougaloo College
Tougaloo, MS

Dear Dr. Strange,

The pieces of material which were allegedly dropped by a "flying saucer" near Brooksville, Florida according to a recent Blue Book determination, are being forwarded to you for analysis. The analysis of these UFO specimens is related to the security of the United States and to the public interest. The signed paper clippings will explain the sighting as the observer reported it.

I believe that the two pieces of material which were allegedly dropped by the "flying saucer" are of great interest and could give us an important clue as to the identity of the UFO. I would appreciate your performing the following:

a. What type of paper or material are these pieces composed of?
b. The nature of the ink or graphic on the specimen.
c. Are there similar types of this material manufactured in the United States?
d. Can you perform a chemical analysis of the fibers?
e. Can you determine whether the material is made in the United States and where?

Due to the publicity which this sighting has received and the nature of the objects, I would be most happy to give your company credit for performing the analysis if you so desire. I would appreciate your expediting this analysis of the material in all of the ways mentioned above.

Sincerely,

INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.

It shows two labeled exhibits, "Exhibit G - Japanese stencil tissue" and "Exhibit G - Speed-O-Print stencil tissue", along with some text below the exhibits describing the image. The text states that the "photo-micrography" from the Institute demonstrates that the tissue samples are similar, but cannot be conclusive as they have not been subjected to detailed analysis.

It is my opinion that the photo-micrograph from the Institute demonstrates that the two samples are quite similar in character. However, this observation cannot be considered conclusive, since the samples have not been subjected to detailed physical and chemical analysis. Any conclusion as to the identity of the materials should await the results of such analysis.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Your recent letter inquired about any help that we could give with respect to the analysis of material collected from outer space. We have examined the sample you sent us and have the following comments:

The sample is composed of best or leaf fibers from any one of a number of plants. Although these fibers are a minor part of the raw material of plants, the composition and segments of the material is not characteristic and includes the following:

1. Flax fibers are used by several companies in this country, principally for the manufacture of specialty papers. In this case the plants are grown especially for this purpose and are not the linen byproduct.

2. A number of plants, such as hemp (Cannabis sativa), jute (principally from India), manila hemp (or abaca) and sisal hemp (or agave) are grown in tropical America and Africa, and their bast fibers are used for cordage and packing material and find their way into this country as such. These products may then be used in a source of fiber for some grades.

3. Mitaumata, kozo, and gampi are examples of plants which are raised primarily for papermaking, principally in Japan. In many cases this is a handmade operation to

produce papers of very special properties. Some of these were imported into this country for use in lens paper and stencil tissue.

It would be difficult to identify these fibers more specifically. We could perhaps attempt to determine their identification somewhat by a microscopic examination. But we would be reluctant to undertake this unless it would be worthwhile from your standpoint. The information you could be made but we do not believe they would serve any useful purpose.

The above comments imply that there is no reason to believe that this product came from outer space. We know you are also interested in determining its possible origin and technical specifications. This product is apparently related to this specialized segment of the paper industry. The sample submitted corresponds to the files we have in the Institute of Paper Chemistry, Appleton, Wisconsin. The sample is similar to some grades of lens paper (see sample of Eastman Kodak lens paper attached) and is used for stencil preparation. Because of its uniform, non-directional formation, we suspect that the sample is a synthetic, man-made product (perhaps rayon). Classifying this sample as of their own manufacture of other sources would require more basic research.

If you contact the following companies:

Distributors, importers and converters of lens and stencil tissues, such as the following: might also be helpful:

A. Dick Company, 5700 W. Touhy Avenue, Chicago, Illinois
Dennison Mfg. Co., 93 Sudbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts
Rev. Angel L. Ramos, 401 Main Place, Clifton, N. J.

If the sample is definitely lens paper, then it seems probable that sheets of any great size would not be readily available to "the man in the street" and that such material may have to be specially ordered. This appears to be the case in our particular distribution and usage of such materials, or through some foreign contact. On the other hand, if the samples shown can be considered as "stencil tissue", such material has been available through an office supply house or similar sources. Here again, we cannot say that the manufacture or distribution of these types of papers might not be probable channels or distribution.

We have made no attempt to analyze the ink or other marking material on the various negatives because we feel that no special experience in this area is required. The fact that the descriptions indicate that the markings probably consist of inscriptions that might be considered "official" rather than by writing with a pencil or ballpoint pen which probably would cause a somewhat different characteristic pattern, leads us to feel that the material might be of some significance. 

In summary, we see no reason to believe that this material came from outer space or foreign sources. The fiber composition, as well as the general chemical nature of the materials, would indicate something that is quite common in regular business and office operations. It is possible that the exact nature of the fiber could be determined by further microscopic examination, but we are not convinced that such effects would be worthwhile. We have suggested several measures that might be taken to determine the authenticity and source of this material, but again we cannot be certain as to the validity and methods of distribution.

If there is any way in which we can be of further assistance we will welcome your questions or suggestions. The Insfitut" is a nonprofit organization.

Transcript of text from the document:

On 9 March 1965, TACCO (USAF), receiving a call from SAFJ-30, Washington (DCAW), indicating that an alleged landing had taken place near St. Petersburg, Florida. A call was made to McDill AFB by Major Quintanilla and contact with the interviewing officer Lt Duncan was made. Lt Duncan had conducted a preliminary investigation of the sighting and his following information was obtained.

A Mr. X, 65 year old man, has been retired and living alone for the last four years in an old trailer. He had contacted a representative of the Brooksville Radio Station with the following story. He had gone for a walk about three miles from his trailer into a woods. He observed an object about four feet off the ground 6 feet thick and 20-30 foot in diameter. Object described as smaller on top and wider at the bottom. It had an outer rim of blades and a stairway. The color was reddish purple, and bluish green. While watching this object, Mr. X. X. observed a five foot tall robot in a silvery uniform. It had 2 glass "eyes". Material appeared to be heavy. The robot had on thin white gloves. He looked at Mr. X through the helmet. He had a pointed chin and head and an attached with a bolt which he pointed at Mr. X. A flash came from the box and Mr. X became frightened. The robot pointed the box at him again and the second flash was observed. He assumed that the object was taking pictures of him. The robot then returned to the ship, that inside, the blades turned at a variable position accompanied by a whistling sound with four legs retracting. The object rose straight up and returned to the landing sight. They looked at the imprints and found some pieces of paper which they took to the radio station.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The following summarizes our analyses, interpretations, and suggestions on the problem submitted to us recently by Major Quintanilla. This is the information that was reported previously but is included and supplemented here for the sake of completeness. We have divided our comments into several categories.

1. Composition of Fiber
The fibers are composed of plant fibers from the bark or the leaves of larger tropical plants. A variety of different species are included in this country and abroad. In some species are not distinguishable from one another in this condition. The most common examples are matsumata, gampi, bast or bastfibres, isiaj, or ramie.
Exhibit A includes photomicrographs showing botanical
identifications of fibers from the unknown sample and from two commercial papers (described below). It also includes photomicrographs of some of the fibers that appear to be coarser or known species for the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry.

There is no photograph or image present in this document. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, discussing the identification and origin of paper samples.

Text extracted from the document:

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

April 2, 1965 
Page 2

Although the United States paper industry is based principally on fibers derived from trees, the use of bast or leaf fibers in this country, and the foreign countries, is not uncommon, and we are concerned with the identification of such foreign produced papers.

In foreign countries, such fibers are grown specifically for papermaking or can be (and often are) recovered from old ropes, cordage, and similar products containing the fibers of this material.

2. Paper Identification

The sample itself is of the type used for lens paper, or stencil tissue (sometimes called Japanese tissue). The sample submitted has a watermark of "DuPont Bond". Examination by microscope reveals a formation very uniform and indicative of high quality composition. There was no evidence of the presence of wood pulp, and the fiber formation was that of a high alpha cellulose content, probably ramie or manilla.

3. Possible Origin

Of the samples which were readily available to us for comparison, one which seems most similar is that produced by the Pulp and Paper Research Association of Canada, Paper Exporters Association. This sample, identified as "Canadian" was examined and appeared identical or very similar to the sample submitted here. It is quite probable that similar materials are produced in countries having climates and soil conditions similar to those in Canada and possibly as the sample would indicate in the Philippines. Similar papers are also manufactured in this country by a number of mills, but we do not know whether the sample submitted was so manufactured by these mills during the present time.

A second sample similar to the unknown, identified as "Speed-o-Print Carbon Correction Sheet No. 7004" is used with mimeograph stencils and obtained from a local office supply house. Obviously this is really ordinary stencil but we do not know whether it is imported or an American product.

Exhibit B includes transmitted light photographs at approximately 3.5 diameters magnification, showing similarities in structure between the unknown, the Canadian sample, and the commercial ramie tissue.

Exhibit C includes specimens of the two commercial papers for comparison with the unknown.

A. Suggestions for Further Exploration

In case additional information on the possible availability or the actual history of the specific sample is desired by the Air Force, we suggest the following:

A. Domestic Paper Manufacturers

There are several companies in this country which are capable of making products very similar to the unknown. We recommend discussion with these companies to determine whether or not any of these compete with each other in this particular segment of the paper industry. Contacts with these companies would be helpful in determining whether or not any of these compete with the sample, and how common this type of paper is in this particular segment of the paper industry.

John A. Manning Paper Co., Inc., P.O. Box 338, Troy,
New York 12181 (Geo. E. Lawson)
Southern Paper Co., 100 Canal St., Windsor Locks, 
Connecticut (Geo. D. Knight)
Corval Tissues, Inc., Middletown, Ohio
Beloit Paper Corporations, 1120 Broadway, New York,
New York (J. T. Grovera)
Brassell Paper Corporation, Mesquidine, Okla., Industries:
Pisgah Forest, North Carolina

In turn, discussion with each of these companies may develop further contacts worth investigating.

B. Users and/or Distributors

At least two types of organizations would be interested in handling papers comparable to the unknown for use as test issues. We suggest that the following be contacted as converters or distributors of paper for test issues:

Among the companies handling mimeograph supplies, we suggest the following be contacted for information on their sources (domestic or imported) and on methods of distribution:

A. B. Dick Company, 5700 W. Touhy Avenue, Chicago, Illinois
Speedograph Business Machines Company, 1801 W. Lake, Chicago, Illinois
Mile Harding Company, Monterey Park, California

In addition, we have recently noticed an article (House Beautiful for November, 1961) suggesting use of various papers for art work and noting that a fit or for archival purposes may not be sufficient. 

Crats Studios, 118 Evans St., New Hyde Park, New York

Importers:

In addition to general importers or specific contacts acquired as a result of the above discussions, the following may be able to contribute useful information:

Whitehead and Alliger Company, Inc., New York, New York

This company is listed as a sales agent for one of the Japanese manufacturers of hand-made papers. We may be able to obtain a lead address for them. It is possible that the firm has been reorganized since issuance of the directory in which they were listed. The following companies are listed as paper merchants in the New York area, though data on right to be related to this investigation:

A. G. Nelson Paper Company, Inc., 420 W. Broadway, New York 12, New York
Whitehead and Alliger Company, Inc., 11 Thomas St., New York 7, New York

The following is an importer of various materials from JAPAN:

(C. M. H. Long)

The following is an importer of pulps and possibly papers of this commercial types:

H. Reeve Angel, Inc., 9 Bridewell Place, Clifton, New Jersey

2. Further Speculation

We have made no chemical analyses of the markings and do not intend to do so. In my previous letter I commented that further microscopic examination had suggested the possibility of the markings having been produced by stamping or printing rather than by an instrument such as a pencil. We should like to elicit the services of someone who is familiar with this type of work and could have been made acquainted with a special type of pencil used in photographic retouching. Some of these pencils were made available thru J. S. Staedtler in this country.

Further speculation about the nature of the markings brought out the comment that the markings might have been made with the aid of some special instruments like a stamp or a device similar to a typewriter. In other words, they were not made by someone who was acquainted with a writing material, a commercial artist, or someone with similar skills.

If there is any way in which we can be of further assistance to the Air Force or to any agency investigating related aspects, please feel free to call upon us.

Comments on UFO Landing Gear, Dr. C.W. Bemiss Memo

TO TDEW (Sgt. Moody)

1. Reference is made to discussion between Sgt. Moody, TDEW, and FDFM/F.M. on 29 Mar 65.

2. It was requested that FDFM comment on the landing gear of a UFO described in the Dr. C.W. Bemiss Memo, dated 12 Mar 65.

3. Studies on landing gear systems for a lunar landing vehicle have considered a circular-arc landing system. The footpad radius (distance between the centerline of the vehicle and the center of the footpad) for this system is adjustable. In varying gear stroke and articulate actuation, the footpad spacings will differ from those shown in the sketch.

4. Another explanation of the unequal footprint spacing is that landing gears are designed to allow variable lateral surface contact to vehicle tilt with respect to the vertical. Landing on a sloped surface of varying concentration components can generate such irregular footprint spacings. However, at least one of these conditions would have to be present to cause unevenly spaced landings.

5. At unequal spacings, with reasons stated above, it is possible that landing gear footpads could indent conditions in the surface, as shown in the photos. There is a probability that an unsymmetrical landing condition (not present symmetrically upon plunges into the ground) The purpose of the probe would be to determine the footpads from impact craters remaining. It is then assumed that some kind of a tube type probe was utilized. Refer to the attached sketch.

- page 108 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document states:

The concentric and eccentric pad footprints are represented in the attached sketches to indicate the possible reasons why:
(1) All four holes are approximately six inches deep. 
(2) Both measurements indicate good footprint impressions and (3) unequal.
From the dimensions of the UFO, it has been determined that the pad imprints spread even though the vehicle may not have been sufficient to prevent overturning of the vehicle. 
Additional information should have been recorded at the landing site, such as the direction of the eccentric pad footprint indentations, i.e. inboard or outboard direction.
The measurements of the impressions serve to determine the soil strength around the holes and at the bottom of the holes would indicate whether or not the vehicle was compact or scooped out.
There are many questions left unanswered, such as why the holes were not distorted during the take-off and whether characteristics of the soil itself could explain the size and shape of the impressions from the facts at hand. It is concluded that a landing with the near geometry and pad indentations above are theoretically possible.
In the soil itself in a case such as this could be utilized to provide further information. It is recommended that in future occasions the following steps are taken:
a. Determine the soil bearing strength values around the area.
b. Measure the footprint areas and depth (of the vehicle landing gear and the crewmen).
c. Obtain plaster casts of all footprints.
From the preceding information data on vehicle and crewmen weights could be estimated.
