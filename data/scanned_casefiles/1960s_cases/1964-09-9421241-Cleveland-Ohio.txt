The rest of the document's text is too blurry or faded to accurately transcribe.

At the top of the page, the header reads:

226     FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE

The image shows a form or document with multiple sections and checkboxes, typical of a Project Blue Book UFO sighting report form. However, due to the image quality and scanning, many of the specific details and text are difficult to read clearly. The page number 226 is visible at the top left corner of the document.

APPENDIX M       257

[Location field appears to read]: Cleveland, Lorain County, Ohio

[Some text is partially illegible, but appears to include a small hand-drawn sketch/arrow]

At the bottom of the form, there is a partially legible handwritten note that seems to read: "ONCE WAS WING PASSING OUT OF FORMATION"

The document appears to be a standard form with multiple sections, typical of Project Blue Book UFO report documentation, with page number 257 and marked as "APPENDIX M" at the top.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

228 FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE

[The rest of the text in the form is partially illegible due to the low quality of the scanned image. Some words and sections are visible but not completely clear enough to confidently transcribe.]

The document appears to be a standard UFO reporting form from Project Blue Book, with sections for details about a UFO sighting, but the specific details are difficult to make out due to the image quality.
