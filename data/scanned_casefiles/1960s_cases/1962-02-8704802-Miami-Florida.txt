11. COMMENTS
Obj. viewed by witnesses was as it approached moon due to brightness of that area. Moon was 74% illuminated at time of sighting. Obj. was not observed in vicinity of moon. This could be attributed to any of several explanations singularly or collectively. Witnesses stared at bright moon and their was last radar duration. Witnesses missed obj. as it emerged and did not emerge where expected.

Gentlemen:

On February 14, shortly after 9:00 p.m., I was sitting with three other persons by the swimming pool at the Key Biscayne Hotel, Key Biscayne, Florida, the sky was cloudless, and the stars and the moon were very bright. While watching the sky, we saw a bright light, as bright and as large as any star in the sky (as a matter of fact, it looked like a star) moving across the sky, roughly from west to east. We thought it might be Echo. We have seen it a number of times. However, as it approached the vicinity of the moon, it dimmed. We thought that this was because of the brightness of the moon and that we would see it again on the other side of the moon. It seemed to us that its path should have taken across the face of the moon. We watched for at least 20 minutes, but did not see it again. We estimated that it should have taken it no more than 2 minutes to pass over and beyond the moon's radiance so that its brightness could again be seen. But, as I said, we did not see it again.

We wondered if it was a weather balloon, etc. Could you enlighten us?

Sincerely,
(Mrs.)

P.S. It was not a falling star. We cannot figure why it did not come out on the other side of the moon.

CODE:

On February 14, at approximately 9:15 p.m., while sitting with three others by the swimming pool of the Key Biscayne Hotel, Key Biscayne, Florida, facing roughly north, the hotel to our left and the ocean to our right, we saw a bright light, just like the brightest and biggest star in the sky, moving through the other stars. The night was clear and bright and the moon was shining. We watched it for approximately 4 to 6 minutes until it came into the aura of the moon. It then dimmed and faded completely from our view. We watched for about 20 minutes, expecting it to come into view again on the other side of the moon - that is, to the right of the moon as we were facing it. However, if did not appear again. Had it reappeared, I would have written to the Air Force--I would have thought it was one of the Echo satellites. We have seen Echo a number of times and have also seen some of the Russian sputnicks.

The direction of this light was roughly from west to east, or it was heading in the direction of the ocean. The direction may have been southwest to northeast.
