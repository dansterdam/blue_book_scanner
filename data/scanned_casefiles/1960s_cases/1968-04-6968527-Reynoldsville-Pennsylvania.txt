As mayor, my office has thoroughly investigated the recent reports of an unidentified flying object in this area. Based on our investigation, I can state that there is no evidence to support these claims. The object sighted was likely an ordinary aircraft or weather phenomenon, and there is nothing to indicate the presence of any extraterrestrial activity. We will continue to monitor the situation, but at this time there is no cause for concern.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOUR WITNESS SAW THE UFO WHEN IT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'U' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE UFO MOVED WHEN LAST SEEN.

(In the sketch below, place an 'X' at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a 'U' at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the 'X' and 'U' with a line to approximate the movement of the phenomenon. This will graphically illustrate and show whether the movement conformed to any logical pattern. It is an example of how to complete the larger sketch.)

AFR 80-17(C1)
1. STOP A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE ANY LAST, ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS INDISTINCT OR IRREGULAR, AND INDICATE CLEARLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

PAST EXPERIENCES HAVE SHOWN THAT A SNAP OR PRESS SHUTTER WILL OFTEN FAIL TO SHOW A DEFINITE OBJECT, SUCH AS A SPHERE OR DISC, WHEN WHAT APPEARS TO THE OBSERVER AS A DISTINCT OBJECT, MERELY APPEARS AS BLURRED OR INDISTICT FORMS ON THE FILM. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PERSON TAKING THE PICTURE MOVE THE CAMERA SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AS CLEAR A DELINEATION AS POSSIBLE.
