UFO Observation, 6 and 13 April 1968

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observations of 6 and 13 April 1968. Our investigation revealed that during the time period in question one of the candidates for the Pennsylvania State Senate was campaigning in your area with a helicopter that had numerous colored lights and a siren. We feel that this helicopter was the stimulus for your observation.

2. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
