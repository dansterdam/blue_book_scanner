10. CONCLUSION
Possible (AIRCRAFT)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted a vee shape pattern of yellow lights similar to those of an airplane, but the lights did not blink off and on. No noise could be heard because of the noise from a jet in the area.

COMMENTS: Surface winds at San Luis Obispo at 2000 hrs. were calm. At Vandenburg winds were from 120 deg. at 1 knot.

One of the observers stated that she had seen garnet bag hot air balloons before and didn't think that a hot air balloon caused the sighting. There are several large airfields quite near the observer and several aerial advertisers operate in the area. It is quite possible that the observation was the result of one of the numerous aircraft that operate in the area. Probably one of the electrical aerial advertisers.

SUBJECT: Request for Weather Data

TO: FTD (DFTML)
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. To complete pending UFO evaluations, the following weather data are submitted:

    a. New Winchester, Ohio: See attachment.

    b. Annapolis, Maryland: Synoptic situation on 23 January; Cold front west of Washington, D.C. at 1300L with light rain and snow showers passing Annapolis in the late afternoon. The cold front was off the east coast at 0100L on 24 January. Surface winds Southerly, shifting to North-northwesterly after frontal passage. Mr. Miller, a Cooperative Observer at Annapolis submitted the following data: Maximum temperature on 23 January = 45°F; Minimum temperature on 24 January = 23°F; temperature at 1300L on 23 January = 40°F; rain from 0900L to 1900L and intermittent rain from 2000L to 2200L on 23 January. See also attachment for additional data for stations 72405 (Washington, D.C.) and 72406 (Baltimore, Maryland).

    c. San Luis Obispo, California: Surface wind for 8 Apr 68 at 2000L was calm. Surface wind at Vandenberg AFB was 120° at 1 knot.

2. Data sources were ETAC surface and upper-air history files. Extraction or evaluation of required weather data were adequate for all sightings.
