URGENT
LOS ANGELES, JAN. 16 (UPI)--A GIANT BALL OF FIRE FLASHED ACROSS THE HORIZON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TONIGHT, ALARMING RESIDENTS WHO SWAMPED POLICE SWITCHBOARDS WITH INQUIRIES:
THE CONTROL TOUR AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT SAID IT RECEIVED SEVERAL REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS FROM MANY PLANES IN THE AREA AS WELL AS CALLS FROM MANY RESIDENTS.
A SPOKESMAN AT THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER DESCRIBED THE FLASH AS "A HUGE BALL OF FIRE WHICH SEEMED TO SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS."
IN TWO PARTS, IT WAS GOING NORTHWEST.
"WE ASSUME IT WAS A METEOR," BUT A LOT OF CALLERS SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A SATELLITE RENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE."
THE FLASH ORIGINALLY REPORTED FROM SANTA BARBARA, 110 MILES UP THE COAST, FROM PALMDALE, A DESERT CITY ABOUT 100 MILES NORTHEAST OF HERE, AND THROUGHOUT THE METROPOLITAN LOS ANGELES AREA.
THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL WORD FROM ANY SOURCE AS TO WHAT THE FIRE BALL WAS.
IT WAS THE FOURTH SUCH INCIDENT THAT HAS KEPT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS EDGY. FIRST WAS A SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE FRIDAY NIGHT, A SONIC BOOM RATTLED THE AREA SATURDAY.
UNEXPLAINED--HAVE BEEN BAITING THE SCREEN LINES.
"I HEARD A SWISHING SOUND," SAID FONTANA POLICEMAN WILLIAM TENNEY, TENNEY, AT HOME AT THE TIME, SAID HE HUSTLED HIS CHILDREN INTO THE HOUSE AFTER IT PASSED OVER.
POLICE IN FONTANA, A SUBURB 43 MILES EAST OF HERE, SAID THEY HAD RECEIVED RADIO REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS SAN DIEGO TO THE SOUTH AND BAKERSFIELD TO THE NORTH.
"IT WAS A GIANT WHITE BALL OF FLAME TRAILING A COLD TAIL," SAID POLICEMAN TENNEY.

URGENT

LOS ANGELES, JAN. 16 (UPLI) --A GIANT BALL OF FIRE FLASHING ACROSS THE HORIZON AT DUSK LIGHTED UP MUCH OF CALIFORNIA TONIGHT, CAUSING RESIDENTS ALREADY EDGY BECAUSE OF RECENT UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA.

REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS CAME FROM SAN DIEGO, ON THE MEXICO BORDER WHERE COAST GUARD PLANES WERE DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THE MYSTERIOUS FIREBALL. TO MARINE COUNTY NEAR SAN FRANCISCO, METEOROLOGISTS AT LAS VEGAS, 300 MILES INLAND, ALSO SIGHTED IT.

JUST LAST NIGHT, NIGHT AFTER TREMENDOUS FLASH OF LIGHT BRIGHTENED THE SKY IN SOUTHERN OREGON AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, LIGHTING EUREKA, CALIF., ALMOST TWILIGHT.

THE AIR FORCE AT VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE ON THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA SEASIDE AND THE HIGH PRIORITY BALLISTIC MISSILE LIVED IN THEIR AREA NO U.S. ROCKET FIRING AT THE TIME THE STRANGE LIGHT WAS SEEN TONIGHT SHORTLY AFTER 9 O'CLOCK PST (5 P.M. EST).

APPARENTLY BRIGHTEST OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A VIVID BUT BRILLIANT BALL OF FLAME TRAILING A MULTI-COLORED GLOW. DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIREBALL VARIED. IT WAS SEEN AS A "METEOR BREAKING UP," SAID A SPOKESMAN AT THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER IN LOS ANGELES -- BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A SATELLITE REENTRY.

AIR FORCE MAJ. IRV NEUKIRTH, A MEMBER OF THE BALLISTIC MISSILE DIVISION, SAID, "MAYBE IT WAS A METEOR, MAYBE ONE THAT WAS BREAKING UP, BUT IT WAS BRIGHT--BRIGHTER THAN ANYTHING I'VE SEEN."

AT THE VENTURA AND SANTA BARBARA SHERIFF'S OFFICES, CALLERS WRAPPED WITH CALLS--AS WERE MANY AREA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES, HOWEVER, SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THE OBJECT FELL NEAR SAN LUIS OBISPO, THOUGH THE OBJECT WAS SEEN STILL HIGHER.

QIT TO SEE--A WHITE BALL OF FLAME SPARKING, ESTABLISHING CHANGE SPARKS. (PICKUP 7TH PGM A110NE IT AS THE FOURTH)

2ND LEAD FIREBALL (A123N)
LOS ANGELES, JAN. 16 (UP)--A GIANT FIRE-TRAILING METEOR
FLASHED ACROSS THE HORIZON THROUGHOUT MOST OF CALIFORNIA TONIGHT,
ALARMING THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS ALONG THE COAST AND CAUSING AN
UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA.

REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS CAME FROM SAN DIEGO, ON THE MEXICO BORDER,
TO MARIN COUNTY, NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO--A SPAN OF ABOUT 630 MILES.
IT ALSO WAS SIGHTED BY WEATHERMEN IN AN AIR PORT TOWER IN LAS
VEGAS, 300 MILES INLAND.

TOUCHED OFF BY THE THOUSANDS OF SIGHTINGS WERE WILD REPORTS OF AIR
CRASHES, NUMEROUS FIRES STARTED BY EMBERS THAT WERE MELTING, AND THAT
DEFENSE INSTALLATIONS HAD TRACKED THE HUGE FIREBALL INTO THE PACIFIC.

THE MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA--WHERE THE
FIREBALL APPEARED MOST BRILLIANT--SAID IT WAS A COMMON FOR PERIODIC
SHOWERS OF METEORS TO HIT THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE, CAUSING THEM TO
APPEAR QUITE BRIGHT. SUCH A CONDITION, A SPOKESMAN SAID, IS KNOWN
AS DRACID.

JUST LAST NIGHT A METEOR FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY IN SOUTHERN
OREGON AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, LIGHTING UP EUREKA, CALIF., ALMOST
LIKE DAYLIGHT.

ACCOMPANIED WITH MILITARY AND DEFENSE INSTALLATIONS SHOWED THERE WAS
NO ROCKET FIRINGS AT THE TIME THE METEOR WAS SIGHTED, ABOUT
6 O'CLOCK TONIGHT (9 P.M. EST), AND THERE WAS NO RADAR TRACKING
OF THE FIERY OBJECT.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIREBALL VARIED AS TO WHERE THEY WERE SEEN,
BUT MOST PEOPLE AGREED IT WAS RAPIDLY MOVING NORTHWEST--A GIANT
BALL OF FIRE TRAILING A LONG MULTICOLORED TAIL. OBSERVERS IN SOME
AREAS SAID IT LEFT AN EERIE BLUISH LIGHT AFTERGLOW.

AN AIR FORCE OFFICER, FAMILIAR WITH ROCKET LAUNCHINGS BOTH AT
CALIFORNIA'S VANDENBERG AND CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., DESCRIBED IT AS "A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT---AS BRIGHT AS I'VE EVER SEEN."

UPI A56

EDITORS NOTE--WHEN A LARGE METEOR FLASHED ACROSS CALIFORNIA LAST NIGHT, IT TOUCHED OFF A SERIES OF WILL-AND-FALSE-REPORTS THAT PROVID A CLASSIC STUDY IN THE BEGINNING OF PANIC. THE FOLLOWING STORY IS A PROFILE OF THE INCIPIENT PANIC, HOW IT DEVELOPED AND HOW IT FINALLY WAS RESOLVED BY DONALD L. NEFF

UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL

LOS ANGELES, JAN. 17 (UPI)--IT BEGAN CALMLY ENOUGH: A MYSTERIOUS BRIGHT LIGHT WAS SEEN FLASHING ACROSS THE SKY TRAILING A GLOWING BEFORE IT ENDED. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT FIRES WERE RAGING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA, THAT METAL BEAMS HAD SPRUNG REARING FROM THE SKY AND THAT A MAN-MADE SATELLITE HAD PLUNGED TO EARTH.

SMALL THE REPORTS WERE EASILY CHECKED. THERE HAD INDEED BEEN A BRIGHT FLASH. IT WAS CAUSED, ASTRONOMERS BELIEVE, BY A HUGE METEOR THAT BLAZED THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE, LEAVING A FIERY TRAIL THAT WAS SEEN IN MUCH OF CALIFORNIA AND AS FAR AS 200 MI INLAND.

IT WAS NEARLY AN HOUR BEFORE THE MYSTERIOUS FLASH COULD BE IDENTIFIED. DURING THAT TIME A PIS ING TIDE OF PANIC SEEMED TO OVERTAKE MANY GENERALLY RELIABLE OFFICIALS WHO SOON WERE REPEATING FANTASTIC RUMORS.

UPI'S LOS ANGELES BUREAU FIRST GOT TIPPED ON THE FIREBALL SHORTLY AFTER 6 P.M. BY ITS PHOTO BUREAU MANAGER, RAY MARGNEY, WHO SIGHTED THE FLASH WHILE AT HOME.

A SERIES OF CALLS TO POLICE, LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE CIVIL AERONAUTICS AGENCY AND VARIOUS AIR FORCE AIR FORCE BROUGHT FORTH ENOUGH INFORMATION TO WARRANT AN URGENT STORY THAT AN APPARENT MUCH-METEOR HAD CAUSED A FLOOD OF INCOMING CALLS FROM CORRESPONDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO BUREAUS IN LOS ANGELES, SAN DIEGO, SAN FRANCISCO AND SACRAMENTO BEGAN TAKING ON AN ASPECT OF RUMOR AND PANIC.

IN SAN FRANCISCO, IT WAS REPORTED FIRE WAS RAGING IN MONTEREY, OFFICIALS IN MONTEREY SAID NO FIRES WERE THERE. THEY HEARD THAT FIRE TRUCKS ARE ROLLING ALL OVER LOS ANGELES. THERE WERE NONE. IN LOS ANGELES, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME FALSE ALARMS.

AN AIR FORCE OFFICIAL FROM HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD BAKERSFIELD AND SANTA BARBARA, BUT OFFICIALS IN THOSE CENTRAL CITIES SAID RUMORS HAD GONE FULL CIRCLE. THE ONLY INDICATION OF WHAT POSSIBLY STARTED THE RUMORS WAS SOME CONTROLLED BURNING OF WEEDS AT THAT TIME BY OFFICIALS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY.

PASS--BY--THE AREA APPARENTLY CONNECTED THE CONTROLLED FIRES WITH THE FIREBALL....


- page 8 -

FROM EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE NEAR LOS ANGELES THEN CAME THE REPORT--
OFFICIAL--THAT IT WAS BELIEVED THE AIR FORCE TRACKING STATION AT
OXNARD HAD TRACKED THE FIREBALL. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE FIREBALL
FELL IN THE PACIFIC TO CONFIRM THE EXTENT ISLAND IN THE GENERAL
SAN DIEGO AREA.

THREE TELEPHONE CALLS TO OXNARD AND CALLS TO THE TRACKING STATIONS
AT POINT ARGUELLO AND POINT MUGU OF THE PACIFIC BALLISTIC MISSILE
RANGE ALL FAILED TO CONFIRM THE REPORT.

THEY ALSO FAILED TO CONFIRM REPORTS FROM WIDELY SCATTERED AREAS
THAT THE FIREBALL ACTUALLY WAS A MISSILE OR MAN-MADE SATELLITE BREAKING
UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

OTHER REPORTS--ALL CHECKED OUT AND ALL PROVED FALSE--WERE THAT THE
FIREBALL SMASHED INTO THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS (WHICH ARE DENSELY POPULATED),
THAT IT CRASHED INTO A VALLEY NEAR BORON AND THAT METAL PIECES FROM
IT WERE FOUND.

THE REPORTS AGAIN PROVED TO BE FALSE, AND AS IN OTHER CASES, APPARENT-
LY GREW UP AS A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN AT LEAST THREE SOURCES, IN
THIS CASE THE LANCASTER SHERIFF'S STATION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY,
EDWARDS AND THE CIVIL DEFENSE WARNING SYSTEM.

ALL TOLD, AN ESTIMATED 50 TELEPHONE WERE MADE TO THE UPI LOS
ANGELES BUREAU DURING THE FIRST FRANTIC HOUR OF THE FIREBALL REPORT,
AND ABOUT 50 OUTGOING CALLS TO CHECK THE STORY WERE PLACED.

IT ENDED AS CALMLY AS IT BEGAN, WITH THE STORY REPORTING THAT A
METEOR HAD FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY. THE STORY QUOTED A SPOKESMAN FROM
MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SAYING SHOWERS OF
METEORS WERE COMMON PERIODICALLY--THUS BACKING UP REPORTS OF BRIGHT
METEOR SIGHTINGS SUNDAY IN OREGON AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND LATE
MONDAY, IN HOLLAND.

THERE WAS NO FALSE REPORT OF RUMORS IN UPI'S STORY---BUT REPORTERS
LEARNED AGAIN THE STANDARD OBJECT LESSON TO DOUBLE CHECK THEIR SOURCES.
AND THEY WERE LEFT WONDERING AT THE DISTORTION AND PLAIN FALSENESS
THAT SOMEHOW SEEM TO SPRING UP AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF PANIC.

ALTERNATE DAY LEAD FIREBALL
BY DONALD L. NEFF

LOS ANGELES, JAN. 17 (UPI)--A HUGE FIERY METEOR FLASHED ACROSS
CALIFORNIA LAST NIGHT, TOUCHING OFF WIDESPREAD FEAR OF FIRES.

THE BRIGHT FLASH WAS SIGHTED FROM SAN DIEGO AT THE MEXICO
BORDER TO NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO, A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 630 MILES, AND
AS FAR AS 300 MILES INLAND IN NEVADA.

IT WAS THE SECOND BRIGHT FLASH SIGHTED ON THE WEST COAST IN TWO
NIGHTS AND IT BROUGHT ABOUT A SERIES OF NEAR-PANICKY REPORTS THAT
FIRES WERE RAGING--IN MUCH OF CALIFORNIA, CAUSED BY FALLING EMBERS.
OTHER REPORTS INCLUDED FINDINGS OF METAL PIECES SUPPOSEDLY DEBRIS
FROM THE FIREBALL AND THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS A MISSILE OR SATELLITE
BREAKING UP IN THE SKY.

ASTRONOMERS AT MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
SAID THEY BELIEVED IT WAS A METEOR. THEY SAID PERIODIC
SHOWERS OF METEORS WERE COMMON.

SOME HOURS AFTER THE FIREBALL FLASHED ACROSS CALIFORNIA ABOUT 6
P.M. PST, A SIMILAR BRIGHT FLASH WAS SIGHTED IN MCALLEN, IT WAS ALSO
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN A METEOR BURNING UP IN THE EARTH'S SURFACE.

THE APPEARANCE OF THE METEOR IN CALIFORNIA AND THE RESULTANT SPREAD
OF WILD RUMORS AND BEGINNINGS OF PANIC PROVIDED A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF
HOW PANIC STARTS.
