PI INITION HR 
UKGENT
THE HORIZON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA QUITE A FLIGHT OF ALARMING RESIDENTS GAVE CHASE TO WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS A HUGE WHITE BALL OF FLAME WHICH SEEMED TO SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS. POLICE IN FONTANA RECEIVED NUMEROUS REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS BY RESIDENTS OF OBJECTS IN THE AREA WHICH APPEARED TO BE FOLLOWING EACH OTHER ACROSS THE SKY. 
RESIDENTS AT LEGOLAND CALIFORNIA SAID THEY ALSO OBSERVED SEVERAL AERIAL OBJECTS WHICH APPEARED TO BREAK UP INTO SEVERAL PARTS WHILE TRAVELING ACROSS THE SKY. ACCORDING TO EYE WITNESSES THE OBJECTS WERE DESCRI BED AS HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE AND TRAVELING AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED. 
DESCRIBED THE FLASH ASA HUGE BALL OF FIRE WHICH SEEMED TO SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS. WITNESSES SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A SATELLITE RE-ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. BUT A LOT OF CALLERS SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A FALLING STAR. A BIRTH OF LIGHT WITH A VERY SHORT TRAIL. IT WAS REPORTED BY WITNESSES TO BE FOLLOWED BY A SECOND OBJECT. IT THEN APPEARED TO BREAK UP INTO TWO OR THREE PARTS AND DISAPPEAR.
SANTA BARBARA IS SAID TO REPORT TO THE U.S. COAST GUARD FROM PALDALE A BRIGHT REDDISH GLOW MOVING SOUTHWARD IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. 
THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL WORD FROM ANY SOURCE AS TO WHAT THE OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. RESIDENTS SAID THEY SPECULATED THAT IT WAS EITHER SOME KIND OF AIRCRAFT OR METEOR. 
POLICE OFFICER WILLIAM TENNVLE HEARD A SISHING SOUND IN THE AREA SAID HE PATROLS FONTANA POLICEMAN WILLIAM TENNLE HEARD A SASHING SOUND IN THE SKY IN THE AREA HE PATROLS AND SAID HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE INCIDENT. HE SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE A SMALL EXPLOSION IN THE SKY AND HAS TALKED TO HIS CHILDREN ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. 
IT WAS A GIANT WHITE BALL OF FLAME TRAILING A GOLD TAIL,-

TYPE A-122-HC
UFIC ALRSC-HC
URGENT
LOS ANGELES DIVISION

URGENTLIST LEAD FIRE-ALL CALLS 
ON SIGHTING OF FIRE FLASHING ACROSS THE HORIZON VIEWED BY MILITARY AIR FORCE PERSONNEL.

THE MESSAGE INDICATED A HIGHLY INTENSE LIGHT FLASHING ACROSS THE HORIZON NEAR SANTA ROSA ISLAND CALIFORNIA RECENTLY. A MILITARY OBSERVER AT A NIKE RADAR INSTALLATION ESTIMATED THE SPEED OF THE LIGHT OBJECT TO BE 4000 MILES PER HOUR OR MORE. HIS VISUAL ESTIMATE INDICATED AN OBJECT ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER.

OBSERVERS SAY THE BRIGHT FLASHING CAME MCC TO A SUDDEN STOP AND THEN TRAVELED BACK OVER THE HORIZON STRAIGHT UPWARD AT FANTASTIC SPEED.

METEOROLOGISTS AT LOS ANGELES STATED THERE WERE NO KNOWN METEORS, AIRCRAFT, OR OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON REPORTED AT THE TIME. NATIONAL WEATHER Bureau REPORTED NO ACTIVITY OF THIS NATURE.

ALLIED FORCE AT CANLIFORNIA BASE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. NO U.S. ROCKET FIRINGS AT THIS TIME. THE FINANCE LIGHT WAS SEEN BY OTHER OBSERVERS IN THE AREA.

WERE NO U.S. ROCKET FIRINGS AT THE TIME. THE STRANGE LIGHT WAS SEEN BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS BRIGHTER THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUNLIGHT. IT SHOT STRAIGHT UP GAINING VERY RAPID SPEED.

CIVILIAN ASSUMPTION WAS A METEOR BREAKING UP AT LOW ALTITUDES. NO EXPLANATION IS OFFERED FOR THE SUDDEN STOP AND REVERSAL OF DIRECTION. SOME OBSERVERS FELT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE OR SPACE VEHICLE ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

(NOTE: SOME OBSERVERS CLAIMED IT RESEMBLED A "METALLIC MISSILE" AS IT PASSED BY THEM. MILITARY OBSERVERS STATED IT DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY KNOWN U.S. MISSILE OR AIRCRAFT.)

IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A PIECE TO BE MAY BE SEEN. "MAKES ANY THAT WAS SEEN." UNUSUAL COLORATION AND APPARENT BRIGHTNESS, COUPLED WITH VERY High SPEED AND SUDDEN REVERSAL OF DIRECTION, SUGGEST SOME TYPE OF ADVANCED AEROSPACE VEHICLE. FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED, AS THIS EVENT IS COMPLETELY UNEXPLAINED.

GUT IT AS LISTED. THOUGH THE WEEK REPORT, STILL QUALIFY AS VERY SIGHT UNEXPLAINED SPARKS.

LOS AND LEAD FIREBALI (A15215) 
GIANT FIRE-TRAILING METEOR FLASHED ACROSS THE HORIZEN THROUGHOUT MOST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TONIGHT, ATTRACTING WIDE ATTENTION AND MANY REPORTS TO THE MEXICO BORDER. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING MORE BRILLIANT THAN THE SUN AND LEFT A TRAIL OF FIRE BEHIND IT AS IT DISAPPEARED. THOUSANDS OF SIGHTINGS WERE MADE IN LOS ANGELES, SAN DIEGO, AND IMPERIAL VALLEY AREAS. RADAR INSTALLATIONS TRACKED THE HUGE FIREBALL INTO THE PACIFIC TOWARDS LOWER CALIFORNIA. IT APPEARED MOST BRILLIANT-ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN PERIODICALLY. WITNESSES STATED IT SEEMED TO BE 2 OR 3 TIMES AS LARGE AS THE FULL MOON AND APPEARED TO BREAK UP INTO PIECES CAUSING THEM TO THINK IT MIGHT BE A SPACE VEHICLE DISINTEGRATING, SIMILAR TO DRAKE'S OBJECT. JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT A METEOR FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, LIGHTING UP EUREKA, CALIF, ALMOST LIKE DAYLIGHT. REPORTS FROM INSTALLATIONS SHOWED THERE WAS NO MISSILE FIRING OR OTHER KNOWN EXPLANATION FOR THE LARGE FIREBALL. RADAR TRACKING SHOWED IT ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE INTACT BUT BROKE UP DURING ENTRY. MANY PEOPLE WERE STARTLED AND SOME EVEN FRIGHTENED WHEN IT APPEARED AS IT WAS SO BRIGHT.

LOS ANGELES -- JAN 7, CUPS-57 BEGAN CALMLY ENOUGH. LAST NIGHT A FIERY TRAIL AND A LARGE METEOR FLASHED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IT TOUCHED OFF REPORTS THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT HAD BEEN SIGHTED IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN WEST OF SANTA ROSA ISLAND.

THE REPORT ENDED. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT FIRES WERE STARTED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FROM FALLING DEBRIS, BUT PARKS WERE RAINING PIECES OF METAL AND PLASTIC, ACCORDING TO EARLY REPORTS. HOWEVER, THE REPORTS WERE FAIRLY QUICKLY PROVEN FALSE EXCEPT FOR THE FIERY TRAIL AND METEOR FLASH WHICH WAS OFFICIALLY OBSERVED AND CONFIRMED.

THEN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF LIGHTS OVER SANTA ROSA ISLAND AND UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS IN THE SKY BEGAN POURING IN. APPARENTLY SEVERAL OBSERVERS NEAR LOMPOC SAW STRANGE LIGHTS AND OBJECTS IN THE SKY WHICH WERE NOT OFFICIALLY EXPLAINED. DETAILS ON THIS IS LACKING, BUT APPARENTLY THESE REPORTS SWELLED AND WERE REPEATED BY A VARIETY OF OBSERVERS BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY. THIS APPARENTLY STARTED THE RUMORS THAT WERE SOON CONTROLLED BURNING OF WEEDS THAT WERE MISTAKEN FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

THE ONLY INDICATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED SEEMS TO BE THAT THE REPORTS WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY ENOUGH BY AIR FORCE OFFICIALS FROM HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE TO WARRANT AN AIR SEARCH OVER THE AREA. HOWEVER, NOTHING FURTHER WAS DISCOVERED OR REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS SEARCH. THOSE ARE THE BASIC FACTS AS FAR AS AVAILABLE FROM OFFICIAL RUMORS. IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SEEN OVER SANTA ROSA ISLAND AREA WHICH STARTED SOME SPECULATION, OFFICIAL INTEREST AND INVESTIGATION, BUT NO FIRM CONCLUSIONS.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

"LT. FRED EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE NEAR LOS ANGELES TEXAS -- THE REPORT--
SAYS HIS STATION AT THE BASE OF A UFO HOVERING ABOUT 400 YARDS AWAY. STATION REPORTED THAT THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE OBJECT WAS CYLINDRICAL, GLOWING REDDISH AND APPARENTLY UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL.

AT POINT ARGUELLO AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY CALIFORNIA, THE TRACKING STATIONS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GENERAL WHITFIELD DETECTED RADAR TARGETS CORRESPONDING TO THE OBJECT REPORTED FROM THE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE LOCATION. THERE WERE GROUND RADAR SIGHTINGS.
IT IS REPORTED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL ON GUARD AT THE MISSILE STATIONS IN THOSE AREAS WERE ALSO AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE OBJECT AND COULD SEE IT VISUALLY, ITS SIZE AND REFLECTED COLOR NOTED.

THAT THE FIREWALL ACTUALLY WAS REPORTED FROM SEVERAL AREAS SURROUNDING THE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE SIGHTING. SOME PERSONNEL REPORTED IT SEEMED TO BE BREAKING THROUGH SOME KIND OF FORCE FIELD AT POINT OF PRESENCE.

SEVERAL CONFIRMED VISUAL SIGHTINGS, IT WAS AGAIN PROVED TO BE FALSE, AND AS IN OTHER CASES, APPARENTLY SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC DISTURBANCE TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA. ANGLES COUNTY, WARNINGS CONCERNING THE OPERATION OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. WERE MADE BY THE CONTROL TOWER AND SAFETY OFFICERS. NO UNUSUAL DISTURBANCES TO COMMERCIAL AIR TRAFFIC WAS NOTED.

ONCE AGAIN THE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE AND EL TORO MARINE CORPS BASE TRACKED TARGETS ON THEIR RADAR WHICH CORRESPONDED TO THE VISUAL SIGHTINGS, THE REPORT AGAIN PROVES TO BE FALSE. AND IN THIS REGARD MORE THAN OTHERS, THE UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL REPORT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING MERIT.

TO DETERMINE PROBABLE CAUSE OF UFO SIGHTING AT THIS TIME --
BY DONALD E. KEYHOE
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
LOS ANGELES, JAN. 7 -- A UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL UNCONFIRMED METEOR FLASHED ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S NIGHT SKY, SCOURING FROM SAN DIEGO TO THE NORTHERN CENTRAL COAST, FLASHING BRIGHT AS CHECKING FROM SAN DIEGO TO THE REPORTS OF SUSPICIOUS LIGHTS."
