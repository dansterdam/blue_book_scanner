[Handwritten text, partially legible:]

The Calcasieu Parish Deputy Sheriff was my cousin by State Trooper. He noticed while we were driving that phenomenon. I had just sighted not just asked merely if I like it. At a light, not different in any way. Regularly officiated. P.J. Calais if not Edward Kellehan just went on. Kindred Wilgus Lake Charles, stopped over Black Lake top road - sloped over care, slow down & miles west & below Flight Locals. Sure than 90% cut by our search. The object met not just one sighting. When we got the object frame, just try to the time was also on our distance. I'm sure site with us got out on us to see my then just to object. I stopped in 3 more then it disappeared and I did not see it anymore.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from the Lake Charles area for October 1967. Information on the date of the sighting is conflicting. Originally, the date was reported as 11 October 1967, however, we have subsequently received information stating that the date was 18 October 1967.

2. The sighting was of a series of bright flashes and appeared to the witnesses as explosions except no noise or tremor was felt. The sighting occurred north of Highway 90 and west of Iowa, Louisiana.

3. Previously, we contacted Barksdale AFB; they suggested we contact you concerning possible gunnery/flare activity. A letter from the Director of Operations on 20 December 1967 stated there was no activity on the evening of 11 October that could have caused the sighting. We would appreciate if you would check to see if there was any flare activity on 18 October between 2000 and 2200 hours.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of a reported unidentified flying object observed over the Lake Charles (town), Louisiana area. The observer saw a series of bright fiery flashes, one flash approximately every eight seconds.

2. A check of our Low Altitude High Speed Training Route Chart indicates that your group is engaged in training flights over the area in question. Regardless of information on whether there was activity on the Matagorda, Texas (Water)(08-12) route on 11 Oct at approximately 2100 hours, that could have accounted for this sighting.

*Remarks: While on a roadblock at intersection of HW-10 & 383; Deputy Sonnier observed some flashing lights that appeared to be in the area of the Ward 8 barn. Shortly after this Deputy Sonnier again observed the same flashes and radioed Deputy Foreman who was approximately one mile east of Sonnier. The flashes were also seen by Foreman. The deputies at first thought that these flashes could be dynamite but the flashes were observed from out of the car and no explosion or tremor was felt.

The flashes appeared to be now in a north centrally direction from the NW Town to NW of Klaber, following the Calcasieu River towards the Querlin area. The flashes were in a series of 4 or 5 and appeared to be just above tree top level, the flash or object appeared to be 20 to 50 feet in diameter. After the second series of flashes Sonnier notified Kinder PD and SO Oberlin, Officers from Kinder PD met Sonnier at Indian Village and they also saw the flashes. Deputy Dallas, SO Oberlin also saw the flashes just north of HW 90, west of Kinder. From his account he was the closest officer to the lights while they were flashing.
