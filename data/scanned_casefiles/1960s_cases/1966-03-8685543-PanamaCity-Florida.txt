Dear Sirs:

This morning at about 4:35 A.M. my husband and I watched a star-like object in the sky. At first we thought the object was a falling star. As it came closer, it moved from the west side of the sky toward the east. The object then moved at a high rate of speed and was out of sight in less than a minute. The stars were all out nice and bright. It did not move as a falling star does. It was moving upward or not down toward the earth. It did not leave a trail or anything. My husband and I did not know what to make of it. We did not know if it was some kind of trouble, trouble to explode or do anything odd but followed quickly, yet slowly and silently on its course.

Please do not send us your "Little Blue Book" written for citizens "REQUESTING AIR FORCE FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATION". We do not wish to be bothered by calling them as they would have no interests in objects or something that did not belong to them.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Satellite
