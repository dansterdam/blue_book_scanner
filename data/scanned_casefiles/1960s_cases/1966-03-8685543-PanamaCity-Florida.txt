Dear Sirs:

This morning at about 4:35 A.M. my husband and I watched a star moving upward across the sky in an arch on passed the big dipper. It moved from the west side of the sky toward the east. Then on of of sight in less than five minutes.

There were no clouds. the sky was clear and the stars were all out nice and bright.

It did not move as fast as a falling star does. It was moving upward -- not down toward the earth. It did not leave a "trail" glow or streamer behind it. If it is yours, and if it is any help at to you, it did not seem to be having any trouble, explode or do anything odd but followed quickly, yet slowly and silently on its course.

Please do NOT send us your "Blue Book", written for citizens "PESTERING AIR FORCE ON FLYING SAUCER REPORTS". Not trying to "pest" you. We did not even bother the local air force here by calling them as they would have no interests in objects or something that did not belong here.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
