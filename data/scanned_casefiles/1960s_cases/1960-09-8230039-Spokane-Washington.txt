k. Comments of preparing officer: 142nd Air Defense Wing Flying Safety Officer. The following comments were obtained from an official of the US Weather Bureau, Spokane International Airport, qualifications unknown: "The length of time the object was observed (10 sec), the fact that the pilot observed pieces breaking off the object and the direction of flight (SW to NE) indicate the possibility the object was a man-made object (Satellite.) Meteorites generally burn out within 2 seconds and generally do not exhibit any visible break-up while they are burning out." However, the pilot could very easily have been mistaken as to the time the object was visible.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Country of Activity Reporting: United States of America
Date of Report: 12-1-60

Location: Northwestern United States
Hq, 1422ND AIR DEFENSE WING
Spokane International Airport, Wash.

Date of Incident: 21 Sep 1960
Date of Report: 25 Sep 1960
Date of Interview: 4 Oct 1960

2NDLT Robert E. Salisbury, Jr.

Interviews of Witnesses: None

Subject: Report of UFO Sighting

1. Summary of UFO sighting: (Narrative text begins on AF Form 112a, unless factors in accordance with paragraph 15, AFR 200-2 are furnished for any action deemed appropriate. The reports are the follow-up to the initial electronic report by Spokane Air Defense Sector, SPADS, of 0830 Zulu, 21 September 1960 through 25th Air Division and NORAD. This headquarters was advised by SPADS that this report was handled in its entirety, however, additional information is received that the follow-up report was not completed and is therefore submitted.)

2. The UFO was witnessed by at least three aircrew members during a flying-training exercise on 20 September 1960. The length of time each observed the object, the flight characteristics and estimated size of the object are most outstanding as the witnesses made observations from different altitudes and from two different aircraft.
