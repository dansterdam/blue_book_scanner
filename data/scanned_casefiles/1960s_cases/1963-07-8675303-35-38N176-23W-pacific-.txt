The document appears to be a data table with satellite tracking information from July 14-17, 1963. The table includes columns for time, longitude, latitude, and other numerical data. At the bottom of the page, there are some reference notes about the data, including information about inclination, ascending node, perigee, and other technical satellite parameters.

The document is a single page with dense numerical data arranged in rows and columns, typical of scientific or tracking records from the early 1960s space era.
