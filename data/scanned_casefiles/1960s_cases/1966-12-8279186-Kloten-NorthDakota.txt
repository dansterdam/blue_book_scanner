Hi -

Will try and explain about the night I saw the objects. Seemingly it was dark and clearly did dawn and raining quite heavily. Before I saw the objects the area did look. The light was bright white like fluorescent. I will well remember maybe for me. I was well up when the sky had was there - seemed to and on the road. It disappeared after an instant. I drove slowly and it showed up in the same way. It seemed to turn and go to the left slightly & disappeared. I was quite startled by then.

Within seconds the bright light came and while near the light of where I sat. If the window had been open I could have reached the stars that hung then. I don't remember a noise when it turned. I was as surprising anyway. Shortly after I came the sky was just the same as the car at slightly higher up. Just near the time she came full of yellow stars also. I still hadn't gathered all my wits before the last light came from the rear of the car. Everything was the same and then two and I looked in my rear view mirror and watched it.

I was really too excited to control solid might that I said. And believe it or not, I stopped on the road three it all. I think the mysterious readily thrilled I will show my mysterious and much it according will it can be explained.

Here is the text from the document:

Time:
10½ or 10¾

Survey No 15

No 2 later did not show any stars.
About the edge of the Blue Lakes,
the 3, 4, + 5 were about the
edge of dog states in better.

The 1, and 2 were much easier
about like a tad or less. It's
quite distance 1 and 2 would be
harder to judge the edge.
When it burst and the stars
came down it was beautiful.

This is the best I can make
out hope it helps some.
