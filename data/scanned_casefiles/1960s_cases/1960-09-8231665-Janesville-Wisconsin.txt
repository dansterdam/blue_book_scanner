K. REPORT PREPARED BY: KILLIAN T. NORKIN, CAPTAIN, WIS. ANG 
ADMINISTRATIVE & PERSONNEL SUPERVISOR, GENERAL MITCHELL FIELD, 
MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS: FROM CHECKING WITH PILOTS ASSIGNED TO THE 125 
FIGHTER SQ, WISI AIR GUARD, A STRONG LIKELIHOOD EXISTS THAT THE 
SUPPOSED UFO'S WERE TWO F89J'S FROM THIS BASE. THESE JETS WERE 
FLYING AT 32,000 FEET. I DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY WITH LT. LANG. 
HE COULD NOT ZERO THE TIME IN DEFINITELY, BUT HE SAID THEY WERE FLY-
ING OVER JANESVILLE APPROXIMATELY DURING THE TIME DESIGNATED BY 
THE WITNESS. BECAUSE THEY HAD DONE CONSIDERABLE FLYING IN THAT 
VICINITY, HE WAS UNABLE TO PIN POINT WHETHER OR NOT ONE JET WAS 
IN TRAIL OF THE OTHER JET AT THE TIME THE SIGHTING WAS MADE. LT. 
LANG FURTHER STATED THAT THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE SAC ACTIVITY AT 
THE SAME TIME. OFFICER APPEARED TO BE AN INTELLIGENT IN-
DIVIDUAL AND VERY ARTICULAR IN HIS EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED.
HIS RECOLLECTION AS TO DETAILS WAS GOOD. HE MENTIONED HAVING

PAGE FOUR RJEDAH 79
WATCHED THE ECHO SATELLITE IN TERMS OF APPEARANCE AND ALTITUDE. HE 
STATED THAT THE UFO APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING EVEN FASTER THAN
THE ECHO SATELLITE. OF POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANCE IS A CURSORY REPORT 
FROM THE WEATHER OFFICER AT GENERAL MITCHELL FLD THAT A UFO WAS
SIGHTED OVER MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN THE SAME EVENING. NO FURTHER DE-
TAILS AVAILABLE. THE EVIDENCE AT HAND STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT
PATROLMAN GLASS OBSERVED TWO JETS FLYING. BECAUSE THEY WERE AT
32,232 FEET HE WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND. RECALLING THE ECHO
SATELLITE, HE ASSUMED THAT HE WAS VIEWING ANOTHER SATELLITE, AND
WHEN THE AIRCRAFT CHANGED COURSE, HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND SATELLITES
VEERING, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ASSUMED THEM TO BE FLYING OBJECTS.
(1) NONE. END OF REPORT. THIS REPORT WAS VERIFIED BY MAJOR
FREDERICK H. WILLCOX, 32TH ADIV (SAGE), TRUAX FLD, WIS. INTELLIGENCE
OFFICER.
