K. REPORT PREPARED BY: KILLIAN T. MORKIN, CAPTAIN, WIS. ANG
ADMINISTRATIVE & PERSONNEL SUPERVISOR, GENERAL MITCHELL FIELD,
MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN

PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS: FROM CHECKING WITH PILOTS ASSIGNED TO THE 125
FIGHTER SQ, WIS: AIR GUARD, A STRONG LIKELIHOOD EXISTS THAT THE
SUPPOSED UFO'S WERE TWO F89J'S FROM THIS BASE. THESE JETS WERE
FLYING AT 32,000 FEET. I DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY WITH LT. LAND.
HE COULD NOT ZERO THE TIME IN DEFINITELY BUT, HE SAID THEY WERE FLY-
ING OVER JANESVILLE APPROXIMATELY DURING THE TIME DESIGNATED BY
THE WITNESS. BECAUSE THEY HAD DONE CONSIDERABLE FLYING IN THAT
VICINITY, HE WAS UNABLE TO PIN POINT WHETHER OR NOT ONE JET WAS
IN TRAIL OF THE OTHER JET AT THE TIME THE SIGHTING WAS MADE. LT.
LANG FURTHER STATED THAT THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE SAC ACTIVITY AT
THE SAME TIME. OFFICER [REDACTED] APPEARED TO BE AN INTELLIGENT IN-
DIVIDUAL AND VERY ARTICULATE IN HIS EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED
HIS RECOLLECTION AS TO DETAILS WAS GOOD. HE MENTIONED HAVING

PAGE FOUR RJEDAH 79

WATCHED THE ECHO SATELLITE IN TERMS OF APPEARANCE AND ALTITUDE. HE STATED THAT THE UFO APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING EVEN FASTER THAN THE ECHO SATELLITE. OF POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANCE IS A CURSORY REPORT FROM THE WEATHER OFFICER AT GENERAL MITCHELL FLD THAT A UFO WAS SIGHTED OVER MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN THE SAME EVENING, NO FURTHER DETAILS AVAILABLE. THE EVIDENCE AT HAND STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT PATROLMAN GLASS OBSERVED TWO JETS FLYING. BECAUSE THEY WERE AT 32,000 FEET HE WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND. RECALLING THE ECHO SATELLITE, HE ASSUMED THAT HE WAS VIEWING ANOTHER SATELLITE, AND WHEN THE AIRCRAFT CHANGED COURSE, HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND SATELLITES VEERING, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ASSUMED THEM TO BE FLYING OBJECTS.

(1) NONE. END OF REPORT. THIS REPORT WAS VERIFIED BY MAJOR FREDERICK H. WILLCOX, 30TH ADIV (SAGE), TRUAX FLD, WIS. INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.
