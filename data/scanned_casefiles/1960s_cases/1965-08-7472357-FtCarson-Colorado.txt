11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
UFO report from three teenage girls. Round cigar shaped, silver-white. Object appeared to give off ray of light. Object in SE sky at various estimated elevations from 45-60 degs. Flight straight over the horizon to the SE away from observers. Disappeared behind the mountains. Time estimated at from 5-10 minutes. High in sky. Appeared very large. Direction and duration consistent with Satellite, however the reported brightness would tend to eliminate this as the most probable cause. A/C with landing light more likely.
