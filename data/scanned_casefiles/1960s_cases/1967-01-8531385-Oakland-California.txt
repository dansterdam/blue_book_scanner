a NE direction beyond my rise on

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound:   NONE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, now much of the object would have been covered by the match head?   They were 3 times the size of the stars in the big dipper

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving:   No wings, tells slide appeared 1st in round shape during flight - they looked oval shaped.

[A simple oval shape is drawn on the document]

FIRST SIGHTING OF UFO'S

Jan. 6 1967 time 9:10 to 9:16 PM Pacific standard time

I was looking at the stars in the west, spotted a dark place in the sky, with out any stars. I stared at that spot and finally saw 2 dim golden stars. There light became brighter, using our binoculars (7x15x35 CFC) I looked at them thinking what a beautiful golden color, when they slowly started to move apart. I put down the binocular, stared, put on my glasses, and stood with my mouth hanging open. I just could not believe what I was seeing.

first seen in this postion west north

this is approx. distant they went apart

They just disappeared deep into space from the last postion.

SECOND SIGHTING

The second week of Jan 1967 about 9:30 PM I heard and felt something big go over our house. I went out on our front porch, which is 30 feet above the street level and had the shock of my life. There was a light pattern in the sky the likes of nothing I have ever before.

â€¢ emerald green
larger than red lights

white light
about here

the curved lines

The white light appeared to be under the craft, and loud roar or humming of some kind. IT WAS HUGE AND MOVED SLOWLY AT 800 to 1000 feet.

Oakland hills are 1,500 feet, it was well below that. I watch it go toward the Oakland hills NE, half or a third of the way to the hills, it or appeared to do so, I got the impression it might be round, because of the light gray curved lines I saw; the craft was dark in color. At that height, I should have seen, A TAIL AND WINGS but none were to be seen. The triangle of red lights stayed pretty much in a horizontal position.

To the south was a strotoliner about 3,000 feet heading SW and going East by North was a fan jet about 2,000 feet, all three craft were in my line of vision.

I kept telling my self ITS A TWO TAIL AIR CRAFT, but i still do not know what I saw.

SECOND SIGHTING

I took me three week to get up enough courage to call the Alameda Naval Air Station. They told me I should have reported it when I first saw it. They could not identify what I saw, I talked to one of the pilots and he gave me information about the lighting of the craft there, but was puzzled at what I had seen.

I then called Hamilton Air Base--I just didnt get anywhere there, I got tired of asking for a investigator, or some one who could help me indentify what I saw, after talking to six different offices I gave up.

In the Bay area there are:
Naval Air Station
Oakland Air Port
San Francisco Air Port
Hamilton Air Base
Travis Air Base

These Air Station and commercial planes are all with in approx. 46 mile radius.

There is a good possibly what I saw was 1940 or there abouts Sea Plane, being flown in over this area to go to Vietnam.

[Illegible text] mention that some two tail air craft were being taken out of retirement and put into service, but would not give me any other information.

Third Sighting

Oakland, Calif. March 12, 1967

Time, approx 8:00 PM Pacific standard time

Five to Seven UFO's
Round when coming out of clouds, leveling off they looked oval
Color, golden pinkish
Sound, none
altitude, unknown, but I guess about 20 to 30 thousand feet
Speed of flight,
They came out of the clouds at fast clip, did a sight pause, did some fast scrambling, both in vertiable and horizontal positions

SIZE OF UFO'S
Three times the size of the big dipper stars

On March 12th between the hours of 7:30 to 9:30 the Big Dipper was in North East.

There was a cloud bank on the Oakland hills in the East which was quite high up in the sky. I had been checking the big dipper and as I looked down to the last star in the handle, the cloud bank was some distance from that star, up they came. see map of flight
