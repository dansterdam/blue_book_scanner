Vpe - Catching had 8-15-63, 10:30 - 11:00
The Farallon Islands are about 27 miles west of the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay. During the period from 8-15-63, 10:30 - 11:00, a Coast Guardsman observed an object which he could not identify, hovering and then moving in a westerly direction over the Farallon Islands. The object appeared to be a solid, metallic-like structure, considerably smaller than an aircraft, and was observed for almost 30 minutes.
