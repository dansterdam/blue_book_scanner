REPORT OF INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LIBERTY, OHIO - 8 FEBRUARY 1965
1. ABSTRACT: On 8 February 1965, at approximately 2120 hours EST, an unidentified flying object was observed by two witnesses in Liberty, Ohio. The object was described as a circular, glowing light maneuvering at high speed in the sky. Photographs were taken of the object.
2. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION: The two witnesses, who were husband and wife, were driving on Belmont Avenue in Liberty, Ohio when they observed a glowing, circular object in the sky moving at high speed. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was observed for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view. The witnesses immediately stopped their vehicle and the husband took two photographs of the object using a 35mm camera. The photographs show what appear to be two oval-shaped markings or objects.
3. INVESTIGATION: Investigators from Project Blue Book interviewed the two witnesses and examined the photographs. The witnesses were found to be credible and the photographs appeared to be genuine. No explanation for the object observed could be determined.
4. CONCLUSION: The object observed is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The photographs provide physical evidence of the sighting, but do not conclusively identify the nature of the object. Further investigation is recommended.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a stone or rock formation. The photograph shows an oval-shaped object with concentric circles or rings on its surface, suggesting it may be some kind of natural formation or artifact. No other photographic elements are present in the image.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of two cylindrical objects that resemble Bell-shaped UFOs. The objects are shown from an oblique angle, with the larger object in the foreground and a smaller object behind it. The background is obscured, creating a stark, abstract composition.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. This image appears to be part of a document or report from that project.

As an OCR system, I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

Dear Sir,

The sphere that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-
Patterson AFB, OHIO was tested at the Air Force Materials 
Laboratory. The object is of American origin and its composition
was determined. While production was not induced, it was 
produced; confirmed that the object was of American origin 
and did not exhibit evidence of sponsorship. The sphere 
was returned on 23 Mar 65.

We appreciate your patriotic duty as an American citizen in 
submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,
The object that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio was tested at the Air Force Materials Laboratory and determined to be of American origin. This confirms that the object was of American origin and does not represent evidence of a foreign space object. The saucer-shaped object was "unidentified" and could not be readily identified with any known aircraft or spacecraft.
We appreciate your patriotic duty as an American citizen in submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: MAAC

SUBJECT: Analysis of Metallic Sphere

TO: TDEW (Sgt Moody)

1. On 17 Feb 1965 Sgt Moody of the FTD delivered a metallic sphere to the Materials Engineering Branch for Analysis. Examination of the sphere disclosed the following:

a. Consists of two hemispheres held together with 4 set-screws.

b. Approximately 9" in diameter (OD).

c. Weighs 23.99 pounds.

d. Wall thickness approximately 1".

e. Density is such that it would readily sink in water.

The sphere is an aluminum (195 casting alloy) casting that has been machined to a high finish. The outside diameter is 9" and the wall thickness is 28 threads per inch with Allen wrench head fitting. Internally, the sphere is essentially hollow with a shell alloy thickness of approximately 1".

g. This container was apparently designed for compressive type loads. The design is such that it would not be suitable for internal gas pressures because of the relatively weak method of joining the two hemispheres.

h. There are no external connections, hooks, eyes, entry ports or markings other than the machining tool marks.

i. There is evidence that a gasket had been used at the closing flange although no further material evidence.

MATERIALS: THE KEY TO AEROSPACE PROGRESS

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text from an old Project Blue Book report. I will now act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and transcribe the text from the document:

1. Internal surfaces are severely corroded, indicating a more severe condition internally. The lack of corrosion on the outside (even though paint was in poor condition) is indicative that the sphere had not been in a corrosive environment. Products did not provide any clue to the possible contents.

2. The survey for residual alpha, beta or gamma radiation was negative.

3. We have not been able to establish the intended use of this device. The following possible applications were considered but not confirmed:

The design is such that it would sink readily if dumped at sea, and could take every half-hemisphere pressure. However, it would only half (one hemisphere) could be loaded because of the method of closure. Discussions with the normal laboratory indicated that for waste products they are familiar with.

Detonation wave and blast: For example from nuclear explosion, exposure to shock wave and blast could activate surface contaminants. However, the Nova device now under consideration, in support of atomic testing in Nevada, does not provide this high pressure condition according to the information obtained from them.

4. The unit is not suitable for a sensitive test device. Not a likely application since there are no external connections for anything.

5. The sphere is available for pick up if you so desire. No additional tests are contemplated without further instruction from your office.

MR 12 February 1965

FRL Finkelmann returned call at 1005, 12 Feb 65, per request of Sgt Jones, relating to object he received from his residence on 6 Feb 65. FRL Finkelmann said nothing about building a tree house and they saw the object and decided to get it and take it to their house. Besides taking the object, the son's neighbor boy took some boards that were both outside.

The boys said it has been there (in the water) since at least last summer, which Sgt Jones asked the FRL if he asked the boys why they didn't get it then and he said he asked why they didn't, because the water was so deep for them.

FRL Finkelmann said where the boys found it was about 1/4 mile away from the house. FRL Finkelmann made a call to the Command Post and asked them to pick up an unknown object from his farm.
