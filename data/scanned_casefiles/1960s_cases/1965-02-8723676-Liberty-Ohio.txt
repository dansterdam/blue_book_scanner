Dear Sir:

The sphere that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio was tested at the Air Force Materials Laboratory. A copy of their report is attached. While no specific identification of the object was made, tests conducted, confirmed that the object was of American origin and did not exhibit evidence of space residence. The sphere is being returned to you under separate cover.

We appreciate your patriotic duty as an American citizen in submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: MAAE

SUBJECT: Analysis of Metallic Sphere

9 MAR 1965

TO TDEW (Sgt Moody)

1. On 17 Feb 1965 Sgt Moody of the FTD delivered a metallic sphere to the Materials Engineering Branch for analysis. Examination of the sphere disclosed the following:

a. Consists of two hemispheres held together with 4 set-screws.

b. Approximately 9" in diameter (OD).

c. Weighs 23.99 pounds.

d. Wall thickness approximately 1".

e. Density is such that it would readily sink in water.

f. Sphere is an aluminum (195 casting alloy) casting that has been rough machined at both ends and at the equator. External finish was a black paint. Set screws are steel, 1/4 diameter, 28 threads per inch with Allen wrench head fitting, recessed as Stand. American. Steel alloy is of the 4100 series type.

g. This container was apparently designed for compressive type loads. The design is such that it would not be suitable for internal gas pressures because of the relatively weak method of closure.

h. There are no external connections, hooks, eyes, entry ports or markings other than the machining tool marks.

i. There is evidence that a gasket had been used at the closure flange although no gasket material remained.

MATERIALS, THE KEY TO AEROSPACE PROGRESS


- page 28 -

j. Internal surfaces are severely corroded, indicating a more corrosive environment internally. The lack of corrosion on the outside (even though paint was in poor condition) is indicative that the sphere had not been in a corrosive environment for very long. Analysis of the corrosion products did not provide any clue to the possible contents.

k. A survey for residual alpha, beta or gamma radiation was negative.

2. Discussion.

We have not been able to establish the intended use of this device. The following possible applications were considered but not confirmed.

a. Waste disposal container for radioactive materials. The design is such that it would sink readily if dumped at sea, and could take very high external pressures. However it would not be an efficient container from a payload point of view since only half (one hemisphere) could be loaded because of the method of closure. Discussions with the Mound Laboratory indicated that this was not comparable to any radioactive waste containers they are familiar with.

b. Protective shell for instrumentation exposed to shock wave and blast, for example from nuclear blast. Some years ago the University of Dayton Research Institute manufactured containers something like the one now under consideration, in support of atomic tests in Nevada. However the project engineer on that program examined the sphere and he now have and he discounted it as being one of the type used by them.

c. Deep submersible test device. Not a likely application since there are no external connections for anything.

3. The sphere is available for pick up if you so desire. No additional tests are contemplated without further instruction from your office.

MR 12 February 1965

Ptl Pinkham returned call at 1005, 12 Feb 65, per request of Sgt Jones,
relating to object he received from a residence on 6 Feb 65.

Ptl Pinkham said children were building a tree house and they saw the
object and decided to get it and take it to their house. Besides
this, son a neighbor boy, both age 14, found it. They took
it to the neighbors and they said they better call the Air Force.

The boys said it has been there (in the water) since at least last summer
at which time they said they first saw it.

Sgt Jones asked the Ptl if he asked the boys why they didn't get it then
and he said he never asked them, but figured why they didn't, because the
water was to deep for them.

Ptl Pinkham said where the boys found it was about 1/4 mile away from the
house.

Ptl Pinkham said the boys sounded like they were telling the truth.

[Redacted] made a call to the Command Post and asked them to pick up an
unknown object from his farm.
