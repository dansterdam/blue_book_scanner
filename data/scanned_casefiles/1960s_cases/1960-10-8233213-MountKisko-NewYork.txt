NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: [Partially legible date]

At approximately 7:37 p.m., Wednesday, October 5, 1960, I was on my way back into the house after having come out on the oil level in our outside tank when I noticed a round, bright light, as bright as a star, moving across the sky from the southeast; at the moment I stopped looking, it was about 30 degrees above the horizon. The light moved across the sky directly overhead in a northwesterly direction, vanishing into the haze of distance at about 50 degrees above the horizon. The total time of this flight was about 120 degrees at a slow rate of speed in approximately twenty seconds and in complete silence.

I located outside of the color of this object, but has the impression that it was quite far up.

Before going into the house, I stopped under the porch light and scribbled a brief note regarding what I had seen, so I am not relying on memory while writing this.

I mentioned the above phenomenon only to my family, and had no intention of doing anything further about it, calling that it was rather a curiosity or oddity. It occurred to me, however, that perhaps this phenomenon might have some bearing on the matter of UFOs which I am scanning the Air Force has been investigating.

I have no particular theories regarding the above phenomenon which I am prepared to submit to the Air Force simply as a matter of information.

Dear Sirs:

At approximately 7:57 p.m., Wednesday, October 5, 1960, I was on my way back into the house after having measured the oil level in our outside tank when I noted a round, bright light, as bright as a star, moving across the sky from the southeast; at the moment I spotted this light, it was about 20 degrees above the horizon. The light moved across the sky directly overhead in a northwesterly direction, vanishing into the haze of distance at about 50 degrees above the horizon. The light geographical location was 120 acres at a steady rate of speed in approximately twenty seconds and in complete silence. I cannot make any logical estimate of the altitude of this object, but had the impression that it was quite far up.

Before going into the house, I stooped under the porch light and scribbled a brief note regarding what I had seen, so I am not relying on memory while writing this.

I mentioned the above phenomenon only to my family, and had no intention of doing anything further about it. Feeling that it was probably a pocket or midget of some kind. It has since occurred to me, however, that perhaps this phenomenon might have some bearing on the matter of UFOs which I understand you have been investigating.

I have no particular theories regarding the above phenomenon, and will withhold, and report it to you simply as a matter of information.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature and name redacted]

SA001-34/Lt Col Tacket/mad/7224

31 October 1960

Dear [redacted]

This will acknowledge your letter of 9 October 1960 concerning an unidentified flying object you sighted on the evening of 5 October.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, we are now asking that you fill out the attached Air Force questionnaire and forward via channels to the Commander, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and/or evaluation.

From the general description of the object you sighted, it appeared to be a satellite, but the direction of motion and regular velocity of 6° a second (approximately 300 miles per second at the distance of 8000) are far out of line.

Sincerely,

Enclosure
