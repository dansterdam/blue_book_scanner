Auroras in September
United States

A homogeneous arc is recorded in Robert W. Mack's observation at Herkimer, New York. He used 35 Praktica camera and Panatomic-X film exposed two minutes.

[The rest of the text continues with details about auroras observed in September, including specific observations from various locations, times, and characteristics of the aurora displays. The text discusses aurora activity, its appearance, and observations from different regions.]

At the bottom of the page, there is a photograph of what appears to be an aurora display, with a caption describing its details.

The image is a black and white document page from a scientific publication about astronomical observations.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Silhouetted clouds create a dramatic effect in this September 28th picture by Thomas G. Papp of Mohawk, Wisconsin. He set the lens at f8 for a 1/250 sec. exposure on Kodachrome film near a railroad.

MARTIN ATMOSPHERE

A controversy of several years duration concerning the Martian atmosphere now appears to have been settled by Hydrodynamic Laboratory workers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1960. With Mars' high temperature and low density atmosphere, these workers were able to make precise measurements of the atmospheric structure and polar caps. This could be significant because it suggests that the temperature at the top of the Martian atmosphere is quite different from what was previously believed. Dr. Kies' group presented further evidence for the occurrence of N2 on Mars.

At El Paso, Texas, R. B. Althouse, Jr., took pictures of a UFO with a strange group. He took the 1/250 second exposure at 10 a.m. Mountain standard time with a reflecting telescope with reflecting surface transmitting only light. The film was Kodachrome X.

F. W. Scanlon of Rochester, New York, photographed the brilliant auroral corona at the left. Deneb is the star 14 inches from the left and 1 inch from the top. A compact grouping of stars near bottom center is the constellation Delphinus, the second picture is from an original color transparency by Ian G. McLennan, director of the Queen Elizabeth Planetarium at Edmonton, Alberta.

September Aurora Sequel

SPECTACULAR is the word for these unusual photographs of the northern lights. Both were taken in Canada on September 22, 1963, near maximum activity of the swirling display described on page 256 in last month's issue. F. W. Scanlon was at Rochester, Ont. (at left) about 9:20 p.m. Eastern standard time. He wrote:

"The sky was divided in two by the dark area in the picture. Bands of white light moved from horizon to corona in about 1/25 second. When they met at the zenith, an explosion of red, green, and blue colors occurred. The colors were poised for about two minutes. The corona remained nearly the same shape, but its brightness pulsed and increased with the passage of each light wave."

Ian G. McLennan, in Saskatchewan, from the north when he noticed "a hazy cloudlike town high in the southeastern sky. The sun had just set, and within moments the yellow-green glow of the aurora became visible."

Here is the text from the document:

seen closed blossomed into a shaft of greenness which later formed into a wide spectrum when the arc de rouled in peak when a pearly white ray moved toward the sunset glow. It fused with the twilight colors -- a remarkable indication of the intrinsic brilliance of the display.

The two maps on the facing page were drawn by Carl W. Gartlein of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, from visual observations of the aurora collected by his IGY data center.

The zone of observed auroral activity on September 22nd is plotted for 7 to 10 p.m. Eastern standard time on the left map, and for 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the other. F.H. Krause comments that geomagnetic disturbances lessened during this six-hour interval. Parallel curves indicate the expected auroral southern limit, as forecast by Dr. Gartlein from observations during past days. These maps are adapted from "Newsletter 74" of the IGY center for visual auroral data at Cornell University.
