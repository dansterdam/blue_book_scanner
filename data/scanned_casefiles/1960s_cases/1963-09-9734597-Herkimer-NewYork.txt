The text on the page includes information such as the action number, date, file number, location, and a description of the observed object. The description lists characteristics such as "round", "pea", "red-green (flashing)", and "colored lights".

This image appears to contain a photograph of a natural phenomenon or object in the sky, likely related to the topic of "Auroras in September" mentioned in the text. The text appears to be a report or document describing observations and details regarding unusual sky events or sightings.

As an OCR system, I will extract the following text from the document:

Auroras in September

A phenomenon appeared in the sky at about 9:30 p.m. on September 3, 1963, from Middletown, New Jersey. The phenomenon was observed by several persons, including a professional astronomer, and was described as resembling an aurora. The witnesses stated that the display was very bright, and that it seemed to last for about two hours. It was seen in the northern part of the sky.

According to the report, a similar phenomenon was observed at about the same time from other locations, including New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Herkimer, New York. The observers in these areas also described the event as resembling an aurora.

The report notes that auroras are not commonly seen in this part of the country during the month of September, and that the appearance and duration of the observed phenomenon was unusual for the time of year.

The image contains two photographs. The upper photograph appears to show a landscape with mountains in the distance. The lower photograph shows a blurry, indistinct image that could potentially depict an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Transcription of the text in the document:

At Et Paso, Texas, a mirage-like phenomenon was observed by several observers at 1:30 a.m. on Pebruary 15, 1963. The object was observed traveling in a straight line at a moderate speed. According to the report, the ohjeet appeared to be a conventional aircraft, but it did not have navigation lights and it was brighter than normal aircraft. The object was observed for about 5 minutes.

THOMAS P. MCEWEN, a Milwaukee, Wisc, businessman, reported sighting a strange light early one morning about 3:15 a.m. on July 30, 1962. McBhen said the light appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and about 150 feet off the ground. The light moved rapidly and silently in a straight line for about 2 minutes and then disappeared.

JAMES R. GARDINER, Chairman of the local Citizens Band Radio Club, reported sighting a strange object in the sky on October 12, 1962 at about 8:20 p.m. Gardiner said the object appeared to be about 10 to 15 feet in diameter and was visible for about 4 minutes. The object was observed to make a sharp turn and disappear.

JOHN J. DOBROWOLSKI, a radar technician at Hancock Air Force Base, reported seeing a strange object in the sky on August 12, 1962 at about 10:30 p.m. Dobrowolski said the object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was visible for about 10 minutes. The object was observed to make a series of sharp turns and then disappear.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of the September Aurora sequel. There is no human face visible in the image.

SOURCE: SKY AND TELESCOPE, DEC 63

September Aurora Sequel

Several photographs of the northern skies, taken to record the continuation of the auroral display over Herkimer, New York, on 9 September 1963. The photographs were taken from about 9:25 p.m. Eastern standard time. The display is shown in two distinctive areas in the picture. Bands of white light, typical of auroral forms, can be seen against the darker night sky.

The image contains two maps or diagrams, but no photograph. The text provides a summary describing the observed aerial activity on September 22nd and mentions parallel curves and undulating tracks.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

"GREEN HAND DISTANIONAL LINE A SHAFT OF STREAMERKS WHICH HERE FORMED INTO A WIDE ANGLE. THIS PHEMONENON WAS OBSERVED TO LAST FROM 7:25 P.M. TO 8:30 P.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME SEPTEMBER 22ND.
A REASONABLE INDICATION OF THE INTENSITY OF THE PHENOMENON IS THAT IT WAS NOTED AS FAR AWAY AS ROCHESTER, N.Y. AND UTICA, N.Y. THIS DATA CENTER.

The area of observed aerial activity on September 22nd is plotted for 7 to 10 p.m. Eastern standard time. A question-marked contour indicates that permanent disturbances lessened during this 3-hour interval. Parallel curves and undulating tracks represent the observed paths that were seen to occur."
