DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES DEC. 23-29, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication.

The Surface Weather Map presents a station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

[Handwritten text in response to question 16, partially illegible:]
we very opinion it was the size of 1½ station wagon and when the picture was taken a match would have covered about 1/3 of it.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES DEC. 2-8, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map.

An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows; the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares encoding white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses may result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherm lines are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete total: are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

The first picture I took was when it was real low came out all white, + was taken through a window. The second one I look as a good one, it was taken outside, with out a flash bulb, that was the last picture my camera has taken. I used 3 rolls of film since and they all came out black and then "no" and should be black. I'll ground my camera + should be a new one which I had used to take 6 rolls of film with. So tell me with the camera does all of a sudden broke. Might it appear again, but higher than at Thursday night at appeared, any night more or less as I had no camera, you don't believe it will Pictures was gone, would not even later with out Pictures. If possible tell like the picture back and just maybe there will be somebody somewhere that will believe. I know in my heart this was real, I'll take all I can on it. You can say what you want, but I saw it. I know at was real, as just be cause your people haven't seen one is no proof that they don't exist. The next stage will explain more and its all here as help me.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

TO:     Project Bluebook
         Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. I was contacted about an UFO sighting in my office by a [redacted] on 2 January 1969. She made the sighting on the nights of 30 December 1968 and 1 January 1969 near her apartment in New Carlisle, Indiana. The following is a synopsis of what she told me:

"On Monday and Wednesday nights [redacted] saw the flying objects. They were very bright and she could hardly look at them. On Monday night she took two pictures of one of them with her Polaroid Swinger camera. The first picture did not turn out; however, the second shows a bright object roughly shaped like an inverted saucer. She reports that she has been unable to get any kind of a picture with the camera since then, despite using two rolls of film and trying to photograph such things as her children. The film shows blackness and the side of the film with the developing material is orange; that part of the film is black when a normal picture is taken. There is a small area in the light meter of the camera that looks like it may have been burned. A man that lives in her apartment also took some pictures, but his have not been developed yet. She reports that a large object came in first and then several smaller objects converged on the area. They were bright and some had an orange color. When they were motionless she glowing was dim and when they started to move they grew brighter and a tail stretched out behind them. She also noticed two holes near the tail end of the object. About six people say them on Monday night. One person reported being awakened by a loud buzzing sound. On Wednesday, some members of the New Carlisle Police Department also observed them. When an airplane was approaching the area, the large object moved straight up until it was almost out of sight. After the plane passed, it returned. When one of the objects flew over a service station the lights, which had been off, came on and grew very bright and then went off when the object moved away. The same thing happened to a street light near the service station."

The first picture I took was on 11/19/1968. It was taken through the window which the object was low. The second last one was taken outside. My camera will not take any more pictures. I used 3 rolls of film this picture was 8 clear black & the neg. are light brown on the 1st black.

It happened on Tuesday night. I was going to wake me up it was about 9 night. Pulling me down the door out on the stop at. It pulled me down like all the life was been pulled from me. I got back into the house after what seemed a strangely some time. I just mostly pulled me. Then on Thursday night some thing I work up & pulled me outside on it. And I got the same as before. I got stuck on the first after a while it seem after some time that I was home again. I shut the door & walked through the door glass & it stayed there. With on Tuesday & Thursday night. It will stay in one place & opened the door & stepped out. The porch seemed to me what it would stop & stopped out. It came out down stairs & it would pull the wall. I got back in the house & it would stand still until I went back out. If I could talk to you & explain all this better.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                   12 February 1969

SUBJECT: Call from[redacted] - UFO Sightings of 30 Dec 68 and 1 Jan 69

1. On 10 February 1969, Lt. Marano received a telephone call from [redacted] in relation to her sightings of 30 Dec 68 and 1 Jan 69. She stated that she had received the letter and the photos and negatives we returned to her. She stated she had a picture of the object which she took on 30 Dec 68 that she hadn't submitted to TDPT (UPO). She said she would send us the picture if she was sure she would get back. She has been offered money for this picture and a story. She stated that she was divorced with three children and she could use the money.

2. Mrs. [redacted] stated that there were six witnesses to the first sighting - her three children, the people who live upstairs in her home, and herself. The object was shiny, and when it took off there was a vapor like a jet taking off. Mrs. [redacted] stated there was a knob on top of the object like that of a light on top of a police car. She also stated that there was a bright light which traveled cross ways across the sky lasting about 2 or 3 seconds.

3. The second night the object was sighted by the same people plus a policeman. Mrs. [redacted] stated that the policeman and another man went to look for the object. She said she wanted to take pictures of the object the second night, but her camera couldn't take pictures after she used it during the 30 Dec sighting. The object seemed to turn on a street light by Mrs. [redacted]'s home and the lights in a service station. The humming from the object awoke Mrs. [redacted]. She said it was like a magnet drawing her to the window. A 77-year old woman who lives across town was also awakened by the humming, but she didn't realize what it was and didn't investigate. Mrs. [redacted] said the object gave off a light so bright it seemed like it was daylight. The object lifted up and disappeared at dawn. When asked to describe the object, Mrs. [redacted] stated that the bottom was fluorescent. She said it was a very bright blue when her eyes when she looked at it. There were two holes in the bottom where a vapor came out. The object looked like it had windows but they weren't glass. Mrs. [redacted] also stated that since the sighting her vision gets blurred at times and she gets pains down the back of her neck.

SUBJECT: UFO Witness Profile Reports for September - December 1968

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C. 20036
cc: J. Allen Hynek

    USAF FTD (TDETR) WPAFB

Enclosed are UFO Witness Profile Reports for the months September 1968 through December 1968 inclusive. An Annual Witness Profile report comprising of an overview of the 12 monthly reports has been included in your copy of the NICAP MASS SUBCOM ANNUAL REPORT for 1968.

The UFO Witness Profile Reports are not intended to be exhaustive surveys but rather are a means by which one can quickly obtain a summary of the type of witnesses who are submitting UFO Reports to the NICAP MASS SUBCOM. The "witnesses are referenced to their respective UFO Reports by a "filing number" in order that further information might be obtained as required.

Present Education means a distinct educational unit presently held by the witness. A unit must be fully completed before one is given credit. For example, one might be a Senior in College but would still be listed as a High School Graduate until a degree had been awarded. Due to space limitations there is no distinction between the sexes. The Occupation Other covers a variety of "other-than-listed" occupations such as None, Housewife, Minister, Artist, etc. Enclosed items connected by lines indicate occupation experience, plurality, i.e., one might be an Engineer but hold a private pilots license.

Respectfully submitted,

Dear Sir

Enclosed is the information you ask for except for the picture and since I heard the report of you people made, you don't believe it anyway, you'll just throw it all away & forget it, so if you will the picture you'll have it come & get it. I have been going good many got it so why should I send it to you to display. I will send you the neg. & film I have that were taken to me good & me anyway. I also know there are a lot of people on the road. That believe me & some few seen them & would tell me & would come forward because you people say were nuts. As God is my judge and I swear on the Bible I saw this thing what ever it was & got a picture of it. Some day I am going to write a story about it as I have already been contacted to do an article so you see every one is not crazy. This is one time you can't order a person around, so if you want it you'll have to come & get it also that way I'll know you are interested in see this otherwise it will grow my point, and I know better than to

At 1235, 10 December 68, Sgt Jones received a collect call from Nancy Guntle of Fort Recovery, Ohio. She stated ever since last Thursday night, she and her husband has been followed by this UFO (Thing she called it later). She said where-ever they go, it follows them after dark. She said last night her husband chased it and couldn't catch it. She stated he turned his lights out for awhile to try and catch it and then lost it, but he had to turn his lights on because of a turn in the road and then it came down on him. She stated when there is more than her and her husband with them, it seems to come down on them as when they are alone. She said it is real bright, has a red blinking light, and is not any type of aircraft because it goes so fast.

She said the phone was listed under Dan Guntle. She said she could be reached at this number after 7 PM until 0800 in the mornings. She stated if we had to get in touch with her after that we could reach her where she works, (Flavor Best Processing Ind.), Fort Recovery, Ohio

SUBJ: U. F. O., Sighting of

1. On the evening of December 11, 1968, at approximately 1800Z the local citizens of Thorshofn, Iceland reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object. Thorshofn is a small fishing village located in north eastern Iceland, approximately 250 miles northeast of Keflavik, Iceland and 15 miles east of Site H-2. The object was generally seen in Thorshofn but was not observed from Site H-2.

2. What was generally seen was an oblong object that seemed to be equal in size in relation to the moon. It was white in color with a reddish tint. It seemed to be trailing in a westerly direction, its estimated speed was 100 Kilometers. No noise was heard. The object remained in the area for approximately 30 minutes, from 1700 to 1730. The object disappeared behind Heljaidsleifjall Mountain.

3. The local Icelandic Police was able to take a picture of the object. Due to the fact it was completely dark at the time and a Kodak Instantatic camera was the only one available, the quality of the picture is very poor (see picture one and two). The next day I obtained a picture of the terrain for reference (see picture Three). Enclosure 4 is a rough sketch of the places of sightings and the proposed track of the object. Enclosure 5 is a list of 14 people who saw the object. As said before, the object was generally seen in Thorshofn.

4. While in the town of Thorshofn, I interviewed three people who said they had seen the object. I had a picture of the object with me. The following is a summary of those interviews.

A. Thorsteinn Hikonasson the local Icelandic Policeman. He was notified about the object by the closest point. The object seemed to be oblong in shape. It was about 40 meters in diameter. It was white with a reddish tint. It traveled about 50 kilometers in 30 minutes or 100 kilometers in an hour. There was no noise. There was no sunshine or moon light at the time. The skies were cloudy. He said many people had seen it. He furnished the list of names. He took the picture.

ENCLOSURE (1)


- page 105 -

B. the local Icelandic Contractor. The object was much bigger at first. It was about the size of a full moon. It was oblong in shape and reddish in color. It was brighter at first. At first there seemed to be light coming from two sources which looked like windows. From one of the sources was a rotating blue light. He saw it for 30 minutes and identified it as the object in the picture. The object traveled in a straight line at approximately 100 kilometers. The object did not change altitude or course. If disappeared behind Heljeidalsfjall Mountain. There was no moon, or sunshine and the sky was cloudy.

C. Oil Truck Driver. He saw it from 1700 to 1730. It was oblong in shape. It seemed to get closer to earth. It seemed to be at least 1/3 the size of a full moon. He identified the object in the picture. It was white with a reddish tint. It seemed like a star at first that grew bigger.

5. Here are some scattered details and rumors, according to my interpreter with the report of an U.F.O. on Akureyri radio. This was heard on Monday or Tuesday. The object was traveling Northeast. This has not been confirmed. A man named [illegible] with the evening (not to be confused with the sighting) he saw 3 highly focused beams of lights projected on him. These came from the sky. He thought he was going mad. He is the only witness to this.

6. Evaluation. My evaluation of the sighting is that the people of Thorshofn actually saw an Unidentified Object in the sky. This object does not fit the description of any known aircraft.

Very respectfully

NO EXPLANATION ON THE STRANGE LIGHTS SIGHTED FROM THORSHOFN.

No acceptable explanations have been given of two lights seen by Thorshofn residents yesterday. Thorshofn Ilakansson in the southern sky, near Thorshofn yesterday. The phenomenon and the film was developed by the defense force at Landsnes. In one of the photographs it was possible to see a lighthouse at Landsnes. In this impossible to see what kind of phenomena this is and it is a great distance, but it is impossible to be certain. It is of this world. It is likely a weather observation balloon.

However, because the sky was quite dark, some of this phenomena, at least 30 persons watched this in the sky end, according to those who watched it through binoculars, this thing emitted lights of blue and red color.

We talked with Thorsteinn Hakonarson policeman yesterday and inquired about an investigation into this matter. He said that he had compiled a report on the testimony given by a number of people, all who clearly saw this. Thorsteinn said, that he personally was certain what they saw. Thorsteinn also said that he had taken photographic yesterday, in full daylight, in the area of the shore in an attempt to determine the size of this sphere in comparison with known landmarks and mountains.

To determine the size of Thorsteinn said, that Jon Johansson at Thorshofn had watched this phenomena through binoculars from his house and that as far as he could see the bottom half of this object had strange lights, practically red color.

Jon saw that one half of this thing was a source of light, to exact the upper half had a light source. The light on the upper half looked like a bottom half but with those lights grew further away. Jon called Thorsteinn on the phone and Thorsteinn went out to Taku the photographs.

Thorsteinn also told us, that one Thorsteinn resident, Johann Fr walking outside the village noticed it, or in the time between five or five thirty the day before yesterday. Johann said, that two of them had been walking before yesterday. Johann said, that these rays had followed one another, where they were quite sharply defined on the ground and the light was quite intense.

We talked with Grimur, farmer at Alend in Thistilfjordur, who said that he saw these strange lights very slowly over the southern sky.

As this paper reported yesterday, men who were in Vesturoyri saw strange lights and thirty and eight in the evening. The night before last in the area between four and five minutes past ten they saw was visible to them every ten minutes and was very strong and lit up the area where they were but was not as intense when clouds were between the light.

STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN IN THE SKY IN THORSHEYN COUNTY.

Suspicious lights were seen in the sky to the south of Thorsheyn yesterday around six. These lights - some kind of round lights - were seen by scores of people. Thorsheinn has described this phenomenon, look photographic of this phenomena and the film were being developed last night by the Defense Force at Laugarnes, so far as is known was able to learn. Jon Johansson, driver was first to see the lights around 17.15 hours. He immediately called Adalbjorn Arnarsson, airport manager at Thorsheinn, informing him about this strange object. He was told, that there was a aircraft in the area.

Thorsheinn Hakonarson, policeman, described this phenomena as follows:

I was with Adalbjorn, both of us ran outside and watched this object for about 15 minutes through binoculars. I borrowed a photo with 9.h and tried to take pictures of this thing, but I don't know about the results yet. The camera was not a good one. I shot about six pictures of this thing. This looked like a round thing, a sphere or a disc. In the southern sky and appeared to be about 6 miles, up the slope of the Hlidarfjalls mountain. This thing moved to south west and the size, from where we were standing, appeared about one tenth of the size of the moon.

Jon Jonsson said that he saw this thing first at quarter after five and observed it until around six in the evening. It was difficult to see what this was but most people believe that this was something very unusual. Most people in the village saw this. I light called Adalbjorn on the phone and he told me that there were no aircraft in this area. I watched this thing through binoculars, and I can't describe the shape of this thing, but boys around here believed they saw skis on this thing, which may be an illusion. The light varied in intensity, sometimes it was weak and then again quite bright, but this fluctuation was characteristic. I don't dare say exactly anything about this distance, but if this thing was sighted from the Holsfell mountain area, the distance could be figured out. When this object disappeared over the mountain, it seemed just barely clear the mountains, so it must have been a little over 250 feet up in the air. This strange object then disappeared over the Arnarfjall mountain.

Late last night, Morgunblaðið heard about other strange lights seen by two men yesterday in the Vesturoros'fl in the interior, when they were at a location called Snuduafell in darkness. They saw lights between Eyjabokkla glacier and Geirland and they believe it came over a mountain. In the glacier, they told that these lights were nothing like the brightness from a volcanic eruption. They appeared to be 1 like spotlights. The brightness was enough to light up the area around them, although they were quite far away from where the lights appeared to be.

THE RESIDENTS OF THORSTENN STILL SEE STRANGE LIGHTS.

Strange lights were again seen to the south of Thorstenn at six in the evening of two days yesterday. From those who saw these lights was Thorstenn information, a policeman, who took photographs of it, but Thorstenn informed us yesterday that he knew about it.

In another conversation with some Thorstenn lights. In the evening of Wednesday before last, a great number of people saw some kind of an illuminated disc in the south of Thorstenn and Thorstenn track photographs. Of this, which were developed by the Defense Forces at Lennoxs. Thorstenn told us yesterday, that according to consultations made by the Defense Force, that many appeared to be at a distance of some 50 kilometers from Thorstenn and the disc must be about 400 meters in diameter. The latest photographs, of the lights seen only today, had not been developed yesterday.

Thorstolenn informed us, that he had first seen the light at about 17.15 hours night before last. At first it appeared, that the light was stationary in the southern sky but then it descended rapidly and moved to the west at the same time. Then Thorstolenn had watched the light for a while, it disappeared but then appeared again and by then had drifted considerably further to the west and lower in the sky. Then it disappeared or was turned off, then appeared again further to the west end lower in the sky than before only to be seen very briefly and then to disappear.

Thorstolenn said, that the movement of this light had been independent of the wind. Thorstolenn also said, that the red head been more prominent in the light than one seen last Wednesday, but visibility was worse yesterday than it was last Wednesday.

STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN IN THE WESTFJORDS AREA.

Of late there have been seen, three times, strange lights in the sky over a southern part of the Westfjords area. Þorgunnlauðid had an interview with Þórður Jónsson at Látra, where this light phenomena was seen in the sky for one and a half hour in the evening of Monday.

Þórður Jónsson said, that the light had also been seen from the village of Dildudalsur and one day after Christmas, that the light had been seen passing over the mountain called Straffell. Later, the light was seen from the farm at Hólsvik for some fifteen minutes and finally it was seen from Látra at the same time. The description of this phenomena is identical from these three locations.

Þórður Jónsson gave the following description: The light is light yellow, but variable in color and chance to bright red, also to green. If the light is watched through binoculars, the light ends into colors approx. still. The light is quite large in diameter larger than those worth satellites which have been seen in the sky, the size appears to be between that of a large star and that of the moon. The light moves, in the evening of Monday it moved from east to west, as the wind was blowing at that time.

When the light was seen from Hólsvik, it could be seen for about fifteen minutes. It was a moonless night and too powerful to see the light. It extended to Hlenni, that was in an area about 20 to 35 metres across. In the evening of Monday, this light was seen for one and a half hour from Látra. At that time, the sky was clear, and the moon shone brightly. Þórður Jónsson at Látra believes, that had it been darker this phenomenon would have been even more striking. He claims it quite impossible that this can be explained away as a distress signal rocket. The light moves too slowly to be such a distress signal and it solidly across the sky. Þórður Jónsson said, that he had called the headquarters of the Icelandic Life Saving Association, since it would be very interesting to get some explanation to this phenomena.

Last night, Þórður Jónsson at Látra called us again, since this light phenomena was in the sky and this time, he said it appeared like a rod of some kind extended from the top of it and the light appeared to rock back and forth. Þórður was strong enough to be reflected across the sea. At times it shone with a yellow color, at other times it appeared like a star, very beautiful but variable in shape.

Morgunblaðið discussed this with meteorologist Jónas Jakobsson who said, that it is quite difficult to say what this light be, but there is a great number of all kinds of possible explanations, simply to say it is a phenomenon not known by now. This appears, from the descriptions given, to be some kind of a balloon, which is descending very slowly into the atmosphere, having completed its mission. Probably looking out the area, which includes Látra, at times, such balloons are covered with a light reflecting material, a metallic coating and reflect light quite well. These balloons can reflect moonlight although the moon is not visible from the ground.

Here is the text from the document:

DECLASSIFIED, 6 January 1969.
Page 2, Col. 4-5. Continued.

It was recently found out in Denmark, that strange lights seen in a similar manner there, turned out to be reflected infrared lights. When these lights were seen, a signal deflection, so called CGO balloons, inflated balloons used for television, were photographed. They were down and then blown to pieces. In this case, it might be pointed out, that French research scientists, released a great number of end, that he could not make any definite explanation of these balloons as an explanation.

STRANGE LIGHTS OVER MUSAVIK LAST NIGHT.

Unidentified and unusual light was seen by residents at Musavik last night. The light was seen in the sky to the south east from the town. The light did not appear to move and, but appeared to drift faintly slowly. The light appeared much brighter than a star, had a strange color changing to it. The light was seen by several residents of red and green. This wasn't lights, after all, but one light last night. We have no explanations are available on the reasons for this strange light.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES DEC. 30, 1968-JAN. 5, 1969

The chart in this publication are a
combination of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau publication,
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar
Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Map. All of the charts for one day are
arranged on a single page of this publication.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows; the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding map time are indicated by
small black squares enclosing white
crosses. Areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and on
which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from those station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherms of the
500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t.
The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are

shown as dashed lines, and are labeled
in degrees Celsius. The arrows show
the wind direction and speed at the
500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature
Chart presents the maximum and minimum temperatures for the 24 hour
period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The
points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and
the minimum temperature is plotted
below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation during
the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m.
Amounts in inches to the nearest
hundredth are shown. Lines of equal
precipitation are drawn. Dashed lines
of snow on the ground in inches as of
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

6a. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THIS LINE MAY BE SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
