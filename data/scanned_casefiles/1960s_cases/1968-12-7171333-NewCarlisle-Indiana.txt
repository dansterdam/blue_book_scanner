DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES NOV. 25-DEC. 1, 1968

The charts in this publication are a part of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. The symbols used on the charts are the standard national weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used previously in Daily Weather Map publications are continued on these charts.

The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analysis of the fronts, highs, lows, and other weather features at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24 hour period ending at 1:00 a.m./e.s.t. The amount of precipitation can be determined from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location and the minimum temperature is plotted below.

The Daily Precipitation Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hour period. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period, and complete totals are underlined.

To obtain copies of these maps, write to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AC 43, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Back issues may also be obtained. The price is $4.50 per year, $5.20 additional for airmail within the U.S., $3.75 additional for foreign mail, single copy - 15 cents.

The charts in this publication are a reproduction of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Maps. They include the Synoptic Weather Map, the Upper Air Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication.

The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analyses for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by heavy solid lines. The positions of the high and low pressure centers at times 0, 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding the map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white circles. Areas of precipitation are indicated by precipitation symbols that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the original maps. The analyses on which these maps are based, especially the interpretation of the isobars, are done at the National Meteorological Center, and the analyses are based on all available data.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms at the 500 mb. pressure level, which is approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. The chart indicates the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Temperature and Precipitation Chart presents the maximum and minimum temperatures for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The rainfall amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are indicated by a trace (T). Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

Last night about 6:45 local time I was out in the yard and noticed a very bright object in the sky towards the north moving southwest. At first I thought it was a plane but as I watched it the object got dimmer and then brighter. It seemed to pulsate at times. I ran into the house to get my telescope and when I got back the object had moved a short distance but was still in the same general area. I watched it for about 30 minutes and it continued to pulse with a bright light. The pulsation was about 1 second in duration. It did not seem to be moving very fast, the speed was slow and deliberate. I lost sight of it when it got behind some trees. The night was clear and cold and the object appeared to be about 15-20 degrees above the horizon. It made no sound.
21. PHYSICAL NATURE ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, INSTRUMENTATION, OR OTHER PHENOMENA OBSERVED?
None that I know of. The object did not seem to disturb me or the telescope in any way. I just sat and watched it pulse and move in the sky.
A. DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE?
NO

Text from the document:

The first sighting was at 8:30 P.M. as I walked out the door of my hom and came across some lights in the sky over the hill. These moved across the sky quite rapidly and suddenly came to a halt. They appeared like a good size star, only brighter. At one time they seemed to be gliding side by side and then suddenly take off at a tremendous rate of speed. I cannot say how many there were, but there seemed to be at least three or four. At one time they appeared as just one bright light and then would separate into two or three lights, and then come back together again. I watched them for about 15 to 20 minutes, and they seemed to be moving in all directions, up, down, and sideways.

I went back into the house to get my husband, and when we came back out the lights were still there, but moving farther away. My husband also watched them for some time. It seems to me that they were intelligently controlled, and did not appear to be any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I have seen many planes and satellites, and these were definitely not like anything I have ever seen before. They moved in a manner that could not be explained by any of the usual explanations given for UFOs. I am quite sure of what I saw, and I am wondering if anyone else in the area saw the same thing.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

TO: Project Bluebook
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

I was contacted about an UFO sighting in my office by a woman on 30 December 1968. She made the following report on the UFO sighting on New Carlisle, Indiana. The following is a synopsis of what she told me:

"On Monday evening the woman and her young son were driving home from New Carlisle, Indiana. The following is a synopsis of what she told me:

"On Monday evening the woman and her young son were driving home from New Carlisle, Indiana. They were very bright and she could hardly look at them. On Monday evening she saw two glowing objects which were not high, but low in the sky. They did not turn out to be, however, the second shows a bright object which rapidly changed its inverted saucer. She reports that her camera since then, despite using two rolls of film and trying to photograph, the film shows blackness and the side of the film with the developing material is covered that light is not coming that way, and the film is black when it is developed. The film does not show the lights as normal picture camera that looks like it may have been burned.

A man that lives in town reported pictures a light that had three powerful lights and no other lights around it. He says that when the light came in first and then several smaller objects converged on the light. They stayed awhile and then the light and some of the objects started to move they grew brighter and a tail stretched out behind them. After this motion the light and objects were gone. On Monday at approximately 7:15 p.m. a person reported being awakened by a loud bursting sound. On Wednesday a woman remembered that of this report Carlisle Police Department was investigating an incident that was the same evening as Monday about 7:15 p.m. when the large object moved straight up until it was almost out of sight. After the plane passed, it returned. When one of the lights went off, came on and grew very bright and then went off when the object moved away from her. The same thing happened to a street light near the station where the object was observed."

at all coming from the object. It appeared as a point of light in the

sky and was comparable in size to a bright star, but more brilliant

in appearance.

MEMO FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: Call from *** - UFO Sightings of 30 Dec 63 and 1 Jan 64
1. On 10 February 1964, Lt. Marano received a telephone call from *** She stated that she had received the letter and the photos and negatives we had sent to her regarding the picture she took of the UFO on 30 Dec 63 and 1 Jan 64. She stated that she was going to send us the pictures if she was sure she would get them back. She has been offered more for the pictures and stories than she can afford to get back.
2. Mrs. *** stated that there were six witnesses to the first sighting - three children, the people who live in her home, and herself. The object was shiny, and when it took off there was a vapor like a jet taking off. It hovered and then took off at a high rate of speed, making a bright light which traveled across the sky lasting about 2 or 3 seconds.
3. The second night the object was sighted by the same people plus a policeman. They stated that the object made a sound and another man went to get a camera, but couldn't get it to work. The object was sighted again the second night, but her camera couldn't take pictures after she used it. The object seemed to turn on a street light which annoyed her.
4. When the object came close, Mrs. *** said it was like a magnet drawing the small objects on the ground. She said it was also hovering low over the trees. The witness who investigated claimed the object gave off a light so bright that it seemed blinding. He also stated that the object made no noise and disappeared at an unbelievable rate of speed.
5. Mrs. *** said the object was very bright - the light which hurt her eyes - when she looked at it. There were two holes in the bottom where a vapor was coming out. She said the object looked like it had windows, but they weren't glass. Mrs. *** stated that in the daytime her vision gets blurred at times and she feels that the object might have affected her in some unknown way.

TO: NICAP, WASHINGTON, D.C. 20036

cc: J. ALLEN HYNEK
USAF DIRECTOR CIDER WPADB

Enclosed are UFO Witness Profile Reports for the months September 1968 through December 1968 inclusive. An Annual Witness Profile Report is also included in your correspondence for 1968.

The UFO Witness Profile Reports are not surveys but rather are a means by which one can quickly obtain a summary of the type of witness submitting UFO Reports to the NICAP MASS SUBCOM. The witnesses are referenced to their respective UFO Reports by filing numbers in order that further information might be obtained.

Present Education means a distinct educational unit presently held by the witness. A unit must be fully completed before one is given credit. For example, a person might be listed as having completed a degree but not yet been awarded. Due to space limitations there is no distinction between the degrees.

The Occupation Other covers a variety of "other than" professional licenses. Encircled items connected by lines indicate occupation/experience qualifications, i.e., one might be an Engineer but hold a private pilots license.

Respectfully submitted,

RAYMOND E. FOWLER

Dear Sir,

I appreciate your accepting a copy of my original report on the sighting made by your neighbor in this area. I hope this report gives you a good picture of what transpired that evening as your neighbor saw it. I have tried to give a good many details as possible. If you have any additional questions, do not hesitate to write me again as I am very interested in this type of phenomena and will be glad to assist further if I can.

Since I do not know your neighbor personally, and have no other information than what is contained in this report, I cannot comment in any detail on his reliability or reputation. However, I have found this witness to be quite straightforward, without any apparent tendency to embellish or exaggerate his story. He impressed me as an honest and intelligent man who simply wanted to report what he had seen, without any ulterior motive.

I would be most interested to learn if you have any other similar reports from your area that you could share with me. Such information is always helpful in determining the extent and nature of the UFO activity in a given locality. And of course, should you or your neighbor have any other questions or observations to communicate, please feel free to do so.

Thank you again for your cooperation. I look forward to hearing from you further on this matter.

Sincerely yours,

She pointed & said "There is that big orange light or something. I looked out & saw a bright orange light, it moved slow & high, no noise, just passed over the trees & went out of sight. 
It seemed bigger than any star or planet. It moved slow, very bright & seemed to be rounded or cigar shaped. The light wasn't flashing or anything. Seemed to just pass on by. Couldn't see the outline of anything, just the bright orange light. 
My daughter was very excited & upset as we watched it. I couldn't understand what the heck it was. It seemed to just float or glide by very slowly.
I hope my call has some value. I do wonder if there any others in this area that saw the same thing.

Phone: (419) 596-6747
Telephone: 419-596-6747

At 1235, 10 December 68, Nancy Jones received a collect call from a Nancy Guntle from Fort Recovery, Ohio. She said her husband was very upset over a UFO they had seen the night before. She said her husband said just about the time it was dark they saw this huge bright light hovering over their house. They watched it for some time, her husband said it just hovered there, first on one side and then on the other. It was so bright they could not look at it directly. She said after awhile it moved off in a rapid motion towards the east and was gone. She said her husband was very upset and could not sleep that night. She said she thought there might be some information that could be obtained if someone could come and talk to them about it. She was told to have her husband call this office if he wished to talk about what they saw.

She said the phone was listed under Dan Guntle. She said she could be reached at this number from after 7:30 until 8:00 in the morning. She stated if we had to get in touch with her after that we could reach her where she works.

(Fort Recovery is on the western border of Ohio.)

SUBJ: U. F. O.; Sighting of

1. On the evening of December 11, 1968, at approximately 1800Z the local citizenry of Thornhofn, Iceland reported sighting an unidentified object over the village located north eastern Iceland, approximately 220 miles northeast of Keflavik, Iceland. The sighting was generally seen by residents of the village.

2. What was generally seen was an oblong object that seemed to be emitting in its position a white halo with a reddish tint. It seemed to be traveling in a westerly direction. The sighting was reported to have lasted from approximately 1700 to 1730. The object disappeared behind Hellgadalsjell Mountain.

3. The local Reykjavik Police were able to take a picture of the object. Due to the fact it was completely dark out at the time and a Kodak Instamatic camera was the only one available, the resulting photograph is questionable in quality. The next day the locals obtained a picture of the terrain for reference. (See picture three).

4. While an investigation was conducted several persons who saw the object, as said before, the object was generally seen in Thornhofn. It was said they had seen the object. I had a picture of the object with me. The following is a summary of those interviews.

A. Thorsteinn Inkonsson the local Icelandic Policeman, who was notified about the object by some citizens. He saw it at 30 kilometers away. He said it seemed to be white in shape, about 40 meters in diameter. It traveled about 100 kilometers per hour and seen for about 30 minutes. There was no noise. It left in the direction it came from, as if some kind of sunshine or moon light at the time. There was no flame or glow, nor did it seem to be emitting anything.

ENCLOSURE (1)

- page 105 -

The image appears to contain a typed document or report. There is no photograph present in this particular page. As requested, I will proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output text below:

Object was much bigger at first. It was about the size of a full moon. It was oblong in shape and seemed to be metallic. It was brighter at first like a light reflecting from something metallic. From one of the sources we have determined, it was giving off a steady blue light. The object was oval in a straight line approximately 100 kilometers. The object did not approach within distance or thousands of feet, it hovered and remained stationary. The night was cloudy.

C. Glt Truck Driver. He saw it from 1700 to 1730. It was oblong in shape. It seemed to get closer to the earth. It seemed to be at least 1/3 the size of the full moon. The object remained stationary. It seemed to be like a star at first that grew bigger. 

Here are some more details and rumors, according to my interpreter. There was a report of a U.F.O. on Akurey radio. This may have been what the object was. There is no confirmation of this. These same rumors were circulating Northunberland. Another witness reported that on the evening of December 11, (the day this object was seen) he observed what he believed to be lights in the sky. These same lights were briefly observed for 2 to 3 minutes. He is the only witness to this.

6. Evaluation. My evaluation of the sighting is that the people of Thorshofn actually saw an Unidentified Object in the sky. This object does not fit the description of any known aircraft.

Very, respectfully

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The document contains text that appears to be a report or a description of a UFO sighting. The text reads as follows:

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
Case 170 
Incident at New Carlisle, Indiana
7 December 1968

At approximately 1400 hours on 7 December 1968, several residents of New Carlisle, Indiana reported observing a luminous unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky near their town. 

The object was described as a bright light, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, that appeared to hover and maneuver in the sky for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Local law enforcement and emergency services were notified, but were unable to locate or track the object. No physical evidence or debris was recovered from the reported site of the incident.

This case has been classified as an "Unknown" by the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation. The incident remains unexplained.

"You want to know about the sighting. Okay, let me tell you what I saw. I was out in my backyard, just standing around, when I happened to look up and saw two strange objects in the sky. They were flying very fast, much faster than any airplane I've ever seen. At first, I thought they might be jets, but they weren't making any noise at all. They seemed to be completely silent.

The objects were sort of oval-shaped, with a metallic appearance. They were flying very close together, only about 50 feet apart. As I watched, they began to slow down and then suddenly made a very tight turn, almost like they were doing a U-turn in the sky. After that, they accelerated again and shot off at an incredible speed, disappearing from sight in just a few seconds.

I was really amazed by what I had seen. It was unlike anything I had ever witnessed before. I know what I saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. These objects were truly unidentified flying objects. I'm not sure what they were or where they came from, but I can tell you that it was a very strange and incredible sight.

Remember, I saw it with my own eyes and I know what I saw. I hope this helps you understand what happened. Let me know if you have any other questions."

1. U.F.O. number 2 appeared about 1702 and lasted to 1730 on 13 December 1968. It was in the same direction as the previous sighting. It traveled in a southwest direction at about 10 knots. It disappeared in a cloud which was apparently and distinctly different from the normal cloud cover. It was sighted at site H-2 or by any military personnel. It was cloudy that night.

2. U.F.O number 3 appeared about 1715 on 14 December 1968. We received a report from civilian site 51 that an object was observed in the area. UTC and SN looked out and saw it. UTC and SN looked again later to see if it was still there but it was not seen again. The I.F.F. was not activated.

3. U.F.O. number 3 appeared about 1730 on 28 December 1968. The location was the same as U.F.O. sighted about 1. He said it could be observed from the site. FMC and I went out to observe it. It was a little hazy out but I was able to observe the object. Because of my certainty in evaluation I did not call the main base. The I.F.F. said it did not look like the object in UFO sightings number 1 or number 2.

NO EXPLANATION OF THE STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN FROM THORSHAVN
The strange lights seen by many residents of Thorshavn recently remain unexplained. The lights were seen in the southern sky, and they were of different colors - red, green and blue. The film was developed by the police and the persons at whose home it was taken, but it is impossible to make an adequate interpretation of it. It appears to show a balloon, but various people have opinions on what it was. This is not certain.
At least 25 persons watched this in the sky and some of them even felt that the phenomena were present. This strange and bright display of lights and red color did not last very long.

We talked with Thorstein Indridason yesterday and he told us that the intensity of the light increased and then it gradually decreased and vanished. He said that all those who saw the phenomenon were able to describe it in the same way. There was no cloud or fog around the area where the lights were seen. Several people tried to photograph the lights but according to the information given, the pictures did not come out very well. There was an attempt to observe the lights through binoculars, but this did not help to identify them.

Thorstein also told us that one Thorlakson resident, who is considered a reliable witness, said that he saw three objects in the sky, one of them much brighter than the others. This object seemed to move faster than the others and changed color several times. However, the witness could not make out the exact shape of the objects.
As this report indicated yesterday, many who were in Vestmannaeyjar at the time said that they saw the same kind of lights in the evening. The lights were strong and lit up the area where they were. The light seemed to move very slowly and changed direction several times. It lasted about 10-15 minutes.

STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN IN THE SKY IN THORNTOWN COUNTY.

Suspicious lights were seen in the sky to the south of Thorntown yesterday around six-thirty. This is related by several witnesses, including agricultural scientists. Observer Addibjørn Agurlsson, an airport manager of Thorntown, informed him of this observation. Agurlsson accompanied them to the area where the lights were seen. According to his statement, the lights were first seen moving from east to west and then hovering still, only to start moving again in different directions. The lights disappeared for a brief moment and then reappeared again. The color of the lights was described as being fluorescent-like.

I was with Addibjørn, late for us to watch this object for about 15 minutes. From what I could see, the object appeared to be divided into two separate and well-defined parts. I cannot say anything about the results yet, but I understand that the camera was not a good one. I also heard roaring and hissing noises, which seemed to come from the object, but there was no smell. The object moved to the south and then to the west and the size, from where we were, seemed to be about six feet. This thing moved to south-west and the size from where we were seemed to be about two feet. The object disappeared completely.

Jon Jonsoon said that he saw this thing first at five and observed it until nearly seven o'clock. According to him, the object at times appeared to be several feet long and at other times it look only a few inches long. The object seemed to be about 100 yards away and it appeared to hovered [sic] approximately twenty to thirty feet above the ground. It gave off strange colourings at times. I cannot properly describe the shape of this thing, but they appeared to be mostly circular. The lights may have been just an illusion. The lights seemed to radiate a fluorescent-like glow which at times intensified and then diminished.

Last last night, (Cumberland) heard about other strange lights seen by two men who were driving in the area called Sandycroft. They saw lights hovering above the ground. The lights then began traveling erratically in various directions. The witnesses appeared to be baffled by what they saw. The brightness was enough to light up the area around them, although they were quite a distance from where the lights appeared to be.

HARRY GLADIS, 15 December 1968.
Pase 37, Col. 2-3: 
THE RESIDENTS OF THORSHOHN STILL SEE STRANGE LIGHTS.

Strange lights were again seen to the south of Thorshohn at six in the evening of 15 December 1968. According to the observations, the lights were bright like light bulbs and were hovering at an altitude of about 150 meters. A policeman, who took photographs of it, but the developed film showed no images. The lights were seen for about 10 minutes and then disappeared to the south.

The lights were also seen by several other people of Thorshohn and Thorstein, who took photographs of them, which were, according to their statements, very clear. The film of these photos, however, must be about as good as the policeman's, since it has not yet been developed yesterday.

Thorstein Bjarnason, who had first seen the light at about 17.15 hours at night before last, near the birch at the edge of the wood, told that the light was only visible for a very short time and then disappeared to the west at the same place. It seems that these occurrences of strange lights are connected with Thorshohn and the disc must be about as good as the policeman's, since it has not yet been developed yesterday.

The description of this light had been independent of the wind. Thorstein also said, that the light had been seen more clearly before yesterday than it was last Wednesday.

STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN IN THE WESTFJORDS AREA

Of late there have been seen, three times, strange lights in the sky over the southern part of the Westfjords area. According to the description, the light phenomenon was seen in the sky for one and a half hour in the evening of Monday last.

Thorður Jónsson said, that the light had also been seen from the village of Hólmavík over the mountains. At first the light was small, but it gradually grew in size and brightness. It was hovering and moving slowly, sometimes faster. The light had a circular shape and seemed to be divided into sections. It was quite impossible that this could have been a star or any kind of natural formation as it was complex and multiform and of great brightness. The light was seen until it disappeared to the south.

When the light was seen from Hoefell, it could be seen for about fifteen minutes. It was difficult to judge the distance, but the witnesses were sure it was rather close. The light was seen for one and a half hour from Ísafjörður. At that time, the sky was clear, but the light remained visible until it disappeared to the south, as the wind was blowing in that direction.

Kerlingardid discussed this with meteorologist Jens Jakobsson who said, that it is quite difficult to say what this light can be, but there is a great number of all kinds of phenomena in the sky, and the authorities believe in the probability that it was some new phenomena, which is descending very slowly into the atmosphere, having completed its mission and gradually disappearing from the sight, such as the moon is not visible from the ground.

Transcribed text from the document:

BLUEBOOK RAPID, 6 January 1960, 
Page 2. Col. 4,5. continued:

It was recently found that the strange lights seen, in a similar manner there, turned out to be reflections from some car lights, and that the reported lights seen, as the car came within sight, was simply the reflection of the lights, but it might be pointed out, that much more should be considered in this connection, such as the fact that these sightings were in a remote area, and that the observers had no previous indications that this kind of phenomenon might be, but they just happened to think of these sightings as an explanation.

- page 119 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present on this page of the Project Blue Book document. The page contains detailed photographic data, including the type and make of the camera used, the focal length and type of lens, the brand and type of film, the shutter speed used, the lens opening, filters used, and whether a tripod or solid stand was used. The text also includes additional information about the camera and the observed object.

STRANGE LIGHTS OVER HUSAVIK LAST NIGHT.

Unidentified and unusual light was seen by residents of Husavik, Iceland, last night. The light was described as brighter than 3 stars, and it made strange movements, sometimes appearing to the northwest, then to the north, then to the northeast, fading in and out. The light was observed for about 1 hour, and there are no explanations available for this strange incident.

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the National Weather Service Publication, "Daily Weather Map". They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 MILLIBAR CHART, the THICKNESS CHART, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for each day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are assigned from AD 1-43, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 A.M., 6:00 E.S.T. The isobars, or lines of equal pressure, are indicated by solid lines and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Thickness Chart presents the Thickness and Lowest Temperatures for the 24 hour period ending at 7:00 A.M. E.S.T. The isotherms, or lines of equal temperature, are plotted above the station location, and the maximum and minimum temperatures are listed.

An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to the Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Information Office, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.
