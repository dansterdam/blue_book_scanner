PROJECT 10073 RECORD

2. LOCATION: Osterville, Mass (1 Witness)
3. SOURCE: Civilian

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 Seconds

8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [ X ] No

10. CONCLUSION: Astro (METEOR)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer sighted an object which he described as rectangular, 2 ft long and 1 ft wide, which traveled a level path and went from 20 deg elev in the north to 20 deg elev in the south in 5 seconds. Inverted, low flying aircraft. However since the duration was so short and the speed apparently too great and no sound was observed, it is my opinion that it was a meteor.
