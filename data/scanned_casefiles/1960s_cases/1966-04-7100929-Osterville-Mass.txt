11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted an object which he described as rectangular, 2 ft long and 1 1/2 ft wide, with 2 blue-white lights on the front. Object traveled a level path and went from 20 deg elev in the north to 20 deg elev in the south in 5 seconds. Investigating officer felt that the object was the exhaust glow off a low flying aircraft. However since the duration was so short and the speed apparently too great and no sound was observed, it is my opinion that it was a meteor.
