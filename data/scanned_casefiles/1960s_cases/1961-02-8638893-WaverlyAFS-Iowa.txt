Memo, AFCIN-482X, 14 Mar 61, Request for Analysis

1st Ind (AFCIN-481a/Mr. Picklesimer/jc/74201)                7 Apr 61

TO:   AFCIN-482X (Sgt. Bolieu)

1.   Attached UFO report has been reviewed by this office and has been evaluated. Two possibilities exist:

    a. Equipment malfunction as suggested by the ASO is a good probability, especially since trouble had been encountered earlier.

    b. Since the average speed of the UFO was apparently under Mach 3 it could have been a supersonic aircraft, although no evidence of such is apparent.
