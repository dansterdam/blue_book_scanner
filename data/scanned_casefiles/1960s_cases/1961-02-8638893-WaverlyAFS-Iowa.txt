The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typewritten memo from Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Memo, AFGIN-4E2X, 14 Mar 61, Request for Analysis
1st Ind (AFGIN-4E1a/Mr. Picklesimer/lc/74201) 7 Apr 61
TO: AFGIN-4E2X (Sgt. Bolieu)

1. A USAFSSD UFO report has been reviewed by this office and has been evaluated. Two possibilities exists:
a. Equipment malfunction as suggested by the ASO is a good possibility, especially since trouble had been encountered earlier.
b. Since the average speed of the UFO was apparently under Mach 3 it could have been a supersonic aircraft, although no evidence of such is apparent.
