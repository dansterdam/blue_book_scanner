11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One of the Witnesses evaluated the case himself. He saw Venus the next morning after being advised by BLUE BOOK that the object that he saw could have been Venus. He definitely identified the UFO and Venus as the same.

Photos were taken but were not submitted to the Air Force for evaluation since the object had already been evaluated.

OBSERVATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - Venus

Captain Harrell, Piqua Ohio post - Reference to UFO. They are going to develop film. Patrolman Wilson was involved in seeing the UFO. He was with other man. It was about 515 am when he went out the next morning and saw the same object, Venus. Major Quintanilla informed Patrolman Wilson we would not give his name out. Brigf description of Wilson's observation follows: 1 Mile East of West Milton. Radio man (dispatcher) has a chemist degree, he thought it was the morning star. SE approximately 20 deg, 530 - 545 am. When you stopped the patrol car the object appeared to stop and sway. This is an illusion because of the atmosphere. Planet Venus has magnitude of -4.1. It is so bright that this is common thing to report.

Captain Harrell again - Told him that it was the Planet Venus. Captain Harrell said these things get ridiculously out of hand. Dispatcher & took call, thought that someone was monitoring their radio. Said it would not happen again.

Shepperton, England

Postman Witness

Jimmy Goddard of Saucer Forum, Shepperton, reports that at 12.5 a.m. on the morning of August 26, a postman van-driver in Nelson Lane, Shepperton, saw an unusual sky object emitting a dazzling blue light.

The witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the light was so intense that he could not judge the area of the object, but suggested that it could be compared to a dazzling ball.

"I am a legal - Enron," [text appears partially cut off or illegible]. The object was only in sight for one minute, and no sound could be heard - it should be remembered that van's engine was running.

Some Day...
Saucers for Real?
That Would Bore Us

(C) New York Times Service

WASHINGTON, Mar. 29 - The flying saucers seen in Michigan last week are now officially dismissed as swamp gas. It is probably just as well.

One of these days a genuine flying saucer will come to earth, and after the excitement wears off, there will be one less mystery in the universe to keep us awake.

Psychologists hold that many of us believe in flying saucers because we want flying saucers to exist. Not so. We can see that it is not so by considering what will happen after the first new flying saucers have landed.

The immediate reaction will be an intense interest. All three TV networks will preempt their afternoon schedules, as well as "Batman" and "I Love Lucy" reruns, to cover the event, and no one will telephone the networks no, complain.

THERE WILL be a national wave of disappointment when the saucer opens and fails to disgorge either a tall slim man who resembles Michael Rennie or little green men wearing glass globes around their heads. The likelihood that whatever it is will be able to land missions on earth from distant worlds will have any human characteristics is remote.

When the saucer is opened, if it is more likely to contain cats or flying cockroaches, or, it may contain something utterly uninteresting. Great piles of moss, perhaps, or rubber bands.

Now, while a visit from another planet is a fascinating event to look forward to, the real thing is almost certain to be an anti-climax, particularly if the visitors are no more interesting than cats or rubber bands or moss balls.

After the first few landings, the public will begin to find the whole business tiresome. Then years ago, the prediction that man would shortly travel in space thrilled and absorbed the world. Recently, when two space travelers encountered a serious emergency, thousands of people complained because the networks interrupted favorite TV programs to report what was happening.

NOTHING FALLS nowadays as rapidly as a miracle. After the first few saucer arrivals, we will ask, "What's the idea of interrupting 'Bonanza' to report another saucerload of moss balls?"

This is why the psychologists are wrong. We do not want flying saucers to exist because, once their existence is established, something exciting will go out of life and saucer landings will take their place in the humdrum of daily existence along with the comings and goings of Lyndon B. Johnson, the crash at airlines, and the billings-gate of politics.

What we want is to preserve the possibility that flying saucers exist without ever having to confront the real thing. So long as flying saucers are a possibility, we can entertain dreams about the universe.

So long as they are merely a possibility, it is possible that they really may have Michael Rennie aboard, or little green men with glass globes around their heads.

INSISTS IT WAS THERE

Officer's Film
Shows No UFO
Film Shot by a highway patrolman who said he saw an unidentified flying object hovering over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base early Sunday was developed yesterday and "was blank . . . nothing but sky," officials said.

The Air Force and Highway Patrol officials agreed that the object probably was the planet Venus. Officials of the Air Force's Project Blue Book, the office that investigates UFOs, said Venus was extremely bright over Dayton early Sunday.

BUT PTL. Richard Landwehr still disagrees. He repeats that he is sure what he and two other patrolmen saw was something other than a planet or a star.

He said that if the film developed at the patrol's Piqua post showed nothing, his camera must have been faulty or the object was too high to photograph.

Meantime, investigators at WPAFB got at least four reports of sightings last night that they identified as earth satellites.

Another report from Enon was tentatively identified as a plane, but investigators were checking additional observations, tests and radar data to be sure.

Puzzle Of UFOs
Spreads To The
Dayton Area
The mystery of unidentified flying objects (UFO) reached the Dayton area yesterday when the state highway patrolman reported sighting a "bright light" approaching, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). Patrolman R. D. Landwehr, night dispatcher, said he sighted the light about 5:15 a.m., and snapped a picture of it.

The National Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Office (Project Blue Book), conveniently located at WPAFB, will analyze Landwehr's picture today.

Maj. Hector Quintanilla, head of Project Blue Book, said the sighting is a "normal alert," "routine" of the recent Michigan sightings his group is investigating.

"It's not unusual after incidents such as those in Michigan," he said.

Another patrolman from the Greenville post also thought he sighted a UFO shortly before Landwehr's report near the old Lansdowne airport.

However, Patrolman J. A. Welz later evaluated his sighting as a star, after following it from Greenville to near Welt Million.

Pfl Wilhoit stated that he received the call at 0250 hours, 27 March 1966 and Pfl Landerchick, Post 57, observed the object from State Route 41 and described the object as a large bright light which was from 100 to 600 feet above the ground when he first saw the object. Pfl Landerchick stated that the object moved over Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and hovered for a while then moved in a northwardly direction and was moving back and forth. Pfl Landerchick took pictures of the object did not think the pictures would turn out very good, according to Pfl Wilhoit.

Pfl Wilhoit stated that he would relay the FTD request to the two patrolmen.
