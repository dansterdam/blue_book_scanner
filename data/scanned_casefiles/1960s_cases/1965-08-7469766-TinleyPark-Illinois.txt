11. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
16-17 seconds

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were viewing the stars through a telescope when the object came into view as a "lightning bug" would. One observer said the object traveled 2 deg per second, the other 1 deg per second. According to the main witness this object was traveling South, and his drawing indicates object is going north. First observer also said the object turned 45 deg which he later changed to 10 deg over the phone. The other witnesses did not mention any turns except a zig-zag motion. Both witnesses said the object appeared as a star, and as it traveled on, later appeared to turn red, the disappeared. Skies were broken clouds, 4 mile visibility, ground fog-haze.

TINLEY PARK, ILLINOIS
4 AUGUST 1965

The observers were viewing the stars through a telescope when the object came into view shortly after midnight. According to the observers, all of a sudden the object popped into view like a lightning bug, and moved southwest at an angular rate of 2 - 4 degrees per second. Its color was white, like a star, for the major portion of its journey, turning to a faint red after approximately 10 seconds. The object disappeared suddenly after approximately 16 - 17 seconds total duration. According to one witness the object turned south (according to his report) and north (according to his drawing). At first, one observer stated that the object turned 45 degrees but he later changed his estimate to 10 degrees. The other observer did not mention any turns other than a slight zig-zag motion. No sound was heard and no trail or exhaust was observed.

COMMENTS

One possibility is that of an airplane suddenly turning on its landing lights. This would be the wrong direction for O'Hara International, but it might have been in the landing pattern. However, if this was the case, why should it suddenly change color to red in 10 seconds and then go out very shortly after.

The possibility of a satellite is ruled out because the direction of flight is opposite that of a satellite. The duration is a little long for a meteor. However, by referring to the angular rate chart we see that there still is the possibility that it could have been a meteor and that the observer overestimated the time; however, no trail was reported.

There is no indication or evidence that this sighting was an extraterrestrial vehicle or that it posed a threat to our national security. The case is carried as unidentified since it is not presently explainable in terms of a meteor, or any other plausible explanation.

UFO report

This is a report on a phone call to [redacted] and to [redacted] of their sighting of 5 Aug 65. 5 August may be significant because it is the time when many sightings were going on, but these boys were not out looking for UFO's. They were out with a telescope, shortly after midnight and were lying on the ground looking straight up. All of a sudden there popped into view, "like a lightning bug would" according to [redacted], and moved south-west some 20 per second according to Larry and some 40 per second according to [redacted], the latter being based on a memory test over the telephone. According to [redacted] it turned south (according to his report) and north, according to his drawing. He reports a turn of 450 which he changed to 100 on phone, and [redacted] did not mention any turn in particular, except a zigzag motion.

Its color was white, like a star, for the major portion of its journey, turning to a fainter red later on.

The direction was opposite to that of satellites, and satellites don't turn red. The puzzling matter is its sudden appearance, which both boys agreed upon independently. There was no sound heard.

Referring to the angular rate chart, we see that

There is still the possibility that it could have been a meteor and that the boys have over-estimated the time. They reported no trail whatever, however. Another possibility is that of an airplane suddenly turning its landing lights on - wrong direction for O'Hare - but it might have been in the landing pattern. But why should it change to red in 10 seconds and then go out very shortly thereafter? It disappeared suddenly - it did not fade out with distance. The boys both reported a completely clear sky although there were some clouds later on, and had been some earlier.

Here is the text from the document:

K. Did you notice any unusual activity or conditions, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting. I saw a couple of meteors, But the object seemed to be going too slow to be a meteor. I was looking at stars at the time I noticed this object.

L. Did you take any photographs No
Do you know of any existence of physical evidence of materials No

INITIALS EEH

COMMENT: To this report the young man seemed to notice nothing unusual although he appeared nervous and not sure to the way he saw this object. I feel this young man may have been sighting a star or satellite.
