Much of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and faintness. I can make out some partial text and numbers, such as:

At the top of the page:
- 1965-12-8694593
- 52-57N 168-51W - Alaska

In the upper right corner:
- 181
- (1)
- 36°F

The rest of the text is too blurry and faint to confidently transcribe without risking introducing errors. The document appears to be a typewritten report with multiple lines of text, but the details are not clear enough to read accurately.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely faint and illegible. While there is text visible, the image quality is so poor that I cannot confidently transcribe any of the text. The document seems to be a scanned page with very low contrast, making the text virtually unreadable.
