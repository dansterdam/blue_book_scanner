[Blank table with columns for Day, Month, Year]

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

WE SAW A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT TO OUR LEFT AND AHEAD. AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AN AIRPLANE, BUT IT WAS TOO BIG AND IT SEEMED TO GET CLOSER. PROBABLY PICKING IT WAS GETTING CLOSER. IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE. WE SLOWED DOWN TO WATCH IT. IT WAS ON A DIRECT COURSE, STAYED AT THE SAME HEIGHT, GOT BRIGHTER AS IT GOT CLOSER AND THEN DISAPPEARED FLYING SSW TO CLEVELAND.
