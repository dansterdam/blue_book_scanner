18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? ABOUT 3/4 INCH OF MATCH HEAD WOULD HAVE COVERED THE OBJECT WHEN IT WAS AT ITS CLOSEST TO OBSERVER.

It appears the document is a questionnaire filled out by a witness who reported seeing a UFO. The responses indicate that the witness estimated the object's speed as 520 mph and its distance as 5 miles. The witness was located outdoors and was not moving in a vehicle at the time of the sighting. The witness observed the object using their eyes, as well as through binoculars and a telescope, but not through sunglasses, a windshield, or other optical devices. Finally, the witness was asked to describe the object in their own words, comparing it to a common object that would have a similar appearance.

Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
