11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object the size of a football field, square. Observed by witness hanging up clothes. She went into the house and returned and looked up again and the object was gone. Flight East to West at slow speed. Observer heard jet A/C. Looked up saw this A/C. As the A/C passed out of sight she then observed this object. Initial observation at 30 deg elevation 080 deg azimuth, final observation at 45 deg elevation 050 deg azimuth. Small protrusions on the sides smaller than the wings of an A/C. Looked like it was made of aluminum.

COMMENTS: Report regarded as unreliable. Not likely that anyone observing an object of aluminum larger than a football field with wings smaller than an A/C flying around would consider hanging clothes more important and waiting three hours before reporting the sighting.

THE SIGHTINGS WERE MADE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF EACH OTHER AND WERE SEPARATED BY APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES. THIS INDICATES A POSSIBLE CONFIRMATION, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE UFO WAS OBSERVED BY TWO PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME. HOWEVER, THE DESCRIPTION GIVE, CIGAR-SHAPED VERSUS A SQUARE AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD, CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO CONFIRM EACH OTHER. SINCE ALL THREE WITNESSES ARE RELIABLE, I MUST JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WAS OBSERVED IN EACH CASE. THE WEATHER BALLON CITED IN PARAGRAPH J MIGHT FIT THE CIGAR DESCRIPTION, BUT I OFFER THIS ONLY AS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. I CAN OFFER NOTHING MORE DEFINITE.

1. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE.
