Extracting the text from the document:

PAGE 2 USAAF 10 UNCLAS AFIN: 27908(27 Jan65) Pg 2 of 2
THE SIGHTING WERE MADE WITHIN MINUTES OF EACH OTHER, SEPARATED BY APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES. THIS INDICATES A POSSIB CONFIRMATION, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE UFO WAS OBSERVED BY TWO AT SAME TIME. HOWEVER, THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN: (CIGA-SHAPED VERSUS A SQUARE AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD, CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO CONFIRM EACH OTHER. SINCE ALL THREE WITNESSES ARE RELIABLE, MUST JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WAS OBSERVED IN EACH CASE. THE BALLOON CITED IN PARAGRAPH 1 MIGHT FIT THE CIGAR DESCRIPTION. I OFFER THIS ONLY AS A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. I CAN OFFER NO MORE DEFINITE.
