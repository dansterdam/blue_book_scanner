The following, extracted from Capt Hartke's OD Report dated 27 Jul 64,
is quoted for your information:

"2150 hours, UFO report from Ms[REDACTED]

2155 hours, UFO report from Nrs[REDACTED]

0027 hours, Received call from Maj Cottrell at USAF. He received
this message. Ac 0025, Ngt Burgess at ATC command post passed this UFO
report. Nrs. [REDACTED] called Laredo AFB to report an object passing
South to North at a high rate of speed. It was similar to a star but
larger and very bright. The sighting took place at 28 Jul, 0248z. Two
air policemen A/3C Patterson and A/1C Creagh also observed object, but
would give no estimate of speed to the Duty Officer.

0301 hours, Maj Cottrell called and said that NORAD stated the object
was the ECHO IT satellite."

Is it possible to furnish the OD with a forecast of satellites which
may be observed in the Dayton area?"
