The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram or illustration. The diagram appears to show the horizon and an object or objects above the horizon, as well as a compass-like illustration. The text instructs the viewer to imagine the object or objects above the horizon and provides instructions for drawing a picture to show any changes in the direction of the object or objects during the observation.

The text output from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. This will show how high the object was above the horizon.
Draw the object as you first saw it, place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Draw the object as you last saw it, place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path to show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
