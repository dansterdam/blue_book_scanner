TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UFO Observation, July 30, 1967

Mrs. [redacted], Euclid, Ohio 44123

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

This replies to your kind letter of August 9, 1967 concerning your unusual observation. Investigations revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus. At the time of your sighting, Venus would have been in the eastern sky. The elevation of Venus at that time was consistent with past descriptions of this planet. Venus, with an estimated magnitude of -4.1, was by far brighter than any star visible from the earth, including the sun. 

When stars or planets are viewed low on the horizon, the observer is looking through a denser layer of the earth's atmosphere. This acts as a prism, which in effect causes the incoming rays of light to be bent. This accounts for the apparent change in shape, brightness, and movement. The brightness enables it to be seen before other astronomical bodies. This was the reason it was seen at dusk.

When viewed through binoculars, stars and planets appear too large in size with various distinct lights. This is an usual occurrence caused by apparent and chromatic aberration of the lenses.

There is no photograph present in this document. The image appears to be a page from a report or document, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing an unidentified flying object sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Although we are unable to positively identify the stimulus, we believe this sighting to be the result of a natural or scientific phenomena. The planet Venus has been responsible for numerous UFO sightings since spring. Venus has been responsible for numerous primary sightings why it has been mistaken for other things.

The sighting by Mrs. XYZ does not appear to be the same sighting as yours. It appears to be something operating on ground level. We have not received any additional reports for this sighting. Our investigation indicates that this sighting by Mrs. XYZ was not a flying object but something operating on ground level.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

SUBJECT: Radio Air Force, EUCLID OHIO
Date: 7 July 1967
Dear Major:
On last night, 6 July 1967, at approximately 2225 hrs. I received a telephone call from an individual (name not given) who claimed that he had just observed some unusual aerial activity in the Euclid, Ohio, area. The caller stated that he and some friends had been fishing on the shore of Lake Erie, Euclid, Ohio, when they observed what appeared to be two or three bright objects in the sky. The caller described these objects as being "larger than aircraft" and that they were "moving rapidly, up and down and sideways at high speed." He also stated that the objects appeared to be giving off "brilliant flashes of light." 
The caller was very excited and asked that I notify the Air Force or other proper authorities of what he and his friends had observed. I immediately notified the Command Post, Sixth Air Force, at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, of this UFO report. The Command Post stated that they would pass the information to the appropriate agency.
Sunday and the incidents. I did not see the objects and found no boat in trouble and the men reported seeing something like "explorers life raft" but found no boat, and they were not like regular aircraft. I talked to the Coast Guard. She said they had no report. I am sorry I did not see the objects as I was not out at the time I had called on.

The letter discusses an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed in the Midwest, providing details about its characteristics and the probability that it was caused by an unidentified object.

Dear Bill:

I hope this letter reaches you promptly. As you know, the ecliiptic was about as far north or west as it can get at the time it was questioned. The brilliant object moving after sunset from high in the west to the horizon in the northwest. The reports to the south and east were back-and-forth motions suggesting a high degree of control in the vertical and horizontal directions.

As far as normal atmospheric refraction effects, and the other reports no doubt refer to the larger group of conditions that have become familiar through photographic and visual display of the unspecified objects. While these unidentified objects are seen through optical instruments by the observers, there is also a high probability that they were inserted by the observers through some form of electromagnetic radiation which could color the sightinqs and reports of motions observed with binoculars unless the witness states specifically that the image seemed magnified by the binoculars.

I have a request from Charles Cox, Associate Round News Times World Building, Roanoke, Virginia. Mr. Cox gave me some background information on the South Hill case. Crowder, and I had told him I could not aid him further as I might have compromised my position in Blue Book. He just called, asking if he could obtain that report. Are rather than that him around from one place to another, I told him I'd ask you to send him that report if you can.

Marley had sent, and mentions that he will try to find a geologist at the university who can help identify it.

The sample of rock you sent is still sitting around; now that the summer is over I will try (again) to find a geologist here at the university who might be able to identify it. As a preliminary identification, I would say this is a hunk of rock.

Regards,
Bill

UFO SIGHTING CAUSES A STIR ON EAST 201ST
It was a different colors. It was slower than
a jet plane and seemed to be floating. A crowd
of 50 to 75 people gathered to watch it as it
hovered over the horizon." McCreight said, "It
seemed to have a halo around it. It was two or
three times the size of a jet plane. The UFO
appeared behind clouds and then seemed to move
away and disappear."
MRS. RUDOLPH BEHAN, 94 East 201st st.,
said, "I was in my backyard when I saw it. It was
hovering overhead and making an up and down
motion. It seemed to move away and then come
back again. The Police came."
DAVID McCREIGHT, 93 East 201st st., said,
"I saw it too but I've never seen anything like it
before. I happened to be outside in my yard and I
looked up and there it was over the horizon.
MRS. BEHAN said, "It seemed to have a
halo around it and it was two or three times the
size of a jet plane. It just hung there and then
would suddenly disappear." 
DR. JOHN MESSINA, 5030 Edgewater,
Cleveland, said, "I can't imagine what it could
have been. I saw it too. It appeared to move away
and then come back again." 
NORMAN CONRAD, 93 East 201st st., said,
"It looked like a ball of fire, but it wasn't on
fire." McCieigh said, "It wasn't an airplane. They
are certain something was there."
"RIGHT OVER THERE," East 201st youngsters point to the spot where the UFO was first sighted. Back row, from left, Dale Conrad, Russell Behan, Margaret McGreight, Dr. John Messina, little Darlene Conrad, Debbie Conrad. Front, Norman Conrad.
