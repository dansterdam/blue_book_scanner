34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   12   May   1966

35. (Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.)

I live in the northern part of the city. Almost directly north of us is an airport. It has radar like any other airport. These objects must have passed almost directly over the airport. No one else in the city reported these that I know of. I never called the airport, but I am still wondering if these objects were picked up on radar.

If I hadn't had binoculars with me at the time I probably would not have reported this. The binoculars gave me a much better view. They must have traveled half way across the sky before I spotted them.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Since there were many objects at a pretty good distance, it would probably cover one or two of them.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

They are north rather than a direct, overhead, traveling east.
The circled one was lagging behind somewhat, but rapidly caught up to the rest.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

They traveled straight in the same irregular V-shape pattern

April 28, 1966

Dear Sir,

I am eighteen years old; an avid reader of UFO reports. I was sure it was a one in a million chance that I would ever see one. I did better than that.

I was in my back yard Tuesday, the twenty-six, about 7:50 P.M. I had my binoculars and telescope. I didn't have anything to do, so I went out to look at the stars, moon, etc. The sky was absolutely clear. I glanced to my left. I couldn't believe what I saw. I hurried and put the binoculars to my eyes. There were about twelve small bright dots. They were just as bright as stars. They flew in a V-shape as birds do, but weren't in a definite pattern. They were flying close together. Soon as I located through the binoculars, I noticed one was legging behind a slight bit; it rapidly caught up to the rest. They were traveling in a easterly direction.

I viewed them for only about ten seconds at the most before they went out of sight. For this reason I didn't have time to see their actual shape. I live near an airport and have never seen planes fly that close together and in that pattern. There wasn't any noise. They were pretty high end traveling very fast.

I told my parents and they believed me. About ten minutes later I called a local radio station, but they probably thought it was a joke. I don't blame them. There were no other reports. I assure them in some else in the city of Baton Rouge, Le. would have seen them, but obviously didn't. I am sure what I saw was no airplanes, stars, or meteors. I assure this is no joke.

Could I please get some information on this.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]
