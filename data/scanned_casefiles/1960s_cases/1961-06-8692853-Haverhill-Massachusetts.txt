Stationary

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object probably a low semi-type cloud. Witness in poor health but indicates that the conditions involved. Definite low cloud formation. Witness could not relate the object to some stationary point of reference. It is difficult to make a relative bearing on the object was stationary. Remaining background, an object appears to be moving in opposite direction at a rate which depends upon the ratio of distances between object and observer. Observing conditions, wind (distance velocity). Remaining factors would indicate to be moving in the same direction at a slower rate, nor much depending on the same atmospheric factors. Witness stated that the object was a low squat type cloud, and that the object observation. Quite probable that the object was actually joining another cloud, fusing into the background was actually blending into the background. No evidence that there was any such object that would cause threat. 

11. COMMENTS
Concluded that the witness misidentified a common object, probably a cloud.

UFO Sighting

AFOIN-12 (Major Coleman)

1 AUG 1961

Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. [redacted] for your information, also attached is a copy questionnaire on which Mr. [redacted] made her report. This questionnaire leaves much to be desired as there are some important questions lacking. For this reason a valid conclusion cannot be made concerning the sighting.

Suggest you return the attached questionnaire with comments to the following questions to Foreign Technology Division, AFTIC:

a. In what direction were you moving at the time the object was sighted?

b. Was the object first sighted straight ahead, or was it a little off to the side or left?

c. What was the elevation of the object when first sighted; that is, is it halfway between horizon and overhead, 1/3 of the way up from the horizon to overhead, etc.

d. Were the car windows down at the time?

2. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. [redacted] reporting the sighting of a UFO. A valid conclusion cannot be made from the limited information reported. Suggest more than AFR Form 164 for completion.

Commanding Technical Intelligence Center
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio
Attn: AFOIN-GX3

Dear Sir:

I have been requested by SAFOI to give you the details of the sighting of a flying object which I saw on 7 November 1961 to give about vicinity.

We were traveling approximately NNW-westerly direction at the time the object was sighted.

When the object was first sighted it was to the left of our car.

The approximate elevation of the object was about one third of the way up from the horizon.

The car windows were up at the time.

I will await further questions if you desire.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[First line partially illegible]
... to go out to bring it as I can.

I should like to add that
the flight was definitely too low
close to be mistaken for a
conventional flight, airplane to
be flown by anyone. This was the
particular U.F.O. and to have
your conclusions on the matter.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a duplicate copy of a UFOB Report. My wife saw the object. She is not a NICAP member. I did not see the object.

I have studied the UFO question since 1947 and am convinced that the genuine reports are those of International Concern. I personally both the USAF position of "silence" and NICAP's position that the public should be told the truth. I now send a duplicate NICAP UFO Report Form to you for your information. You may use NICAP Form 582 or its equivalent to my wife if you are interested in her report.

I would add that although disclosure to the public of the facts behind the UFO is indeed a risk, nevertheless, I believe that in the long run it would be best for the USAF to indoctrinate the public so soon as possible to cover possible hysteria in findings or mass close observations are attempted. As a historian, I believe that many UFO sightings are prepared to accept the fact that we are not alone in God's Universe. Be honest with the public. There has been too much confusion in the past.

Yours Sincerely,
[Redacted]

OBSERVER 2

The Object was stationary in the sky and appeared solid.
It was crystal-black and resembled a small airplane. Not
much apart but wings. I am certain that it was not an airplane
because it was too near to me for mistaking it as an airplane.
It was a narrow wide away and appeared to have 300 feet above
the trees on the other side of the field. It was definitely not
moving toward or in such a way that I would appear motionless.
It was motionless. I saw only one side of the object and one of
its wings. The nose was pointing in a South Easterly direction.

I feel that there must be a logical answer for what I saw as
I have always pictured flying Saucers as something transparent
or ethereal and not a down-to-earth solid object like I am
describing. My husband, a USAF member and Cancer researcher informs
me that hundreds have seen solid UFOs. What I am not definitely
not an airplane. Bird, cloud, or anything else. I can
only say that it was an Unidentified Object in the air.
