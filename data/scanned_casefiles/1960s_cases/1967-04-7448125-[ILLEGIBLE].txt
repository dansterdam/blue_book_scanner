18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how
    much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the
    sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details
    of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.

reshaping motions.

After spotting it I ran from

second into as large and bright as
before and continued at same speed/
brightness, and color (white), to the
disk's position at the horizon. I heard
no sound from it at all.

With me my friend saw the object
at the same plane also, blessed at
the same time. I saw a plane for it make no
sound and was to large and
bright to be. I confirmed and
do state with him. I saw it a
middle of 3 seen plenty of range
and other in 3 sided large and
brighter. Now I am a star gazer &
I know it wasn't a star or PLANET.
I saw it a meteor as I saw it before
in the sky was large. Closer the light
eye and held a picture in the right
hand. Some clock to the eye, I saw
away and look at it. This is about
the large it appeared to me. Shown
about 3 times larger than the planet
Venus on the night as seen from
my yard. Very shortly after it flew
up and at the Dragon I heard a
loud noise on it going on that direction. I
really want to tell the airforce that
my brother said if it was anything
they'll know about it.
This is according to men and it export.

The most peculiar thing about it was the four lights and their flickering. All four changed color and flashed in and off for about 2 minutes.

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Probably all of it.

Before retiring for the night the writer checked the local mountain area from residence window to see if any car lights could be seen on the mountain roads (possible spot-lighted). The here-in described light could be seen near the ridge-horizon to the west of my residence. Writer called wife and she came and observed it also. To naked eye it appeared to change color from red to orange and yellow-whitish. Binoculars were obtained. The "light" was above the horizon about 600 yards azimuth it was right over the ridge although there was no depth perception. Stars could be seen around it were plainly visible all during the siting and they did not remain or disappear as did the "light". Through the binoculars were used to focus on it, the "light" did not change color but appeared to yellow-white with a definite red area or brightness that could not be pinpointed. The "light" remained only briefly.

Basically the "light" was steady for about 15 min. It then disappeared completely for about 25 min although the stars near by remained visible. Upon re-appearance it was exactly in the same spot and again stopped visible for about another 5 min later it re-appeared, this time about 100 yds from the previous location at approx. the same elevation, traveling west and was only in sight for approx. 3 sec. after which it went out immediately and was able to observe the light for only a short time before it disappeared behind the ridge. Writer immediately called the color HRB.

center, being a game warden, has had numerous occasions to
observe lights and stars at night. This light was positively not
a star or an artificial light. The approx area where the center
believes the object was near 8PM high down trace let
well above them. Curved surge "fireballs" have been observed in
the past and this was not one.

writer also owns an airplane and flies the area frequently
and is familiar with aircraft lights, this was not one. The
light, when first discovered, was definitely stationary, well above
the ridge. For a period of approx 15 min. Entire disc disappeared,
I am quite certain nothing passed in front of it as the stars
near remained entirely visible.

I'm not saying this was a "flying saucer" because I'm
not entirely convinced they actually exist. It was, however, a
definite, unexplainable object in the sky.

I'm also very familiar with weather balloons. This neither
appeared nor acted remotely like one would act.

Hymera, Ind.
Dear Sir,

I would like to report a sighting that I believe to be a U.F.O. at 9:00 p.m. on April 29, 1967. I saw a satellite going north, I ran home and showed my parents. I watched it and at about 8:10 I thought I saw another coming from the northeast but when it got to where the satellite had been it made a sharp turn and point toward the satellite. About five minutes after they had gone out of sight I saw an object flying at tremendous speed at about 1000 ft. It had two white and two red lights and they were revolving. It made no sound at all.

Two brothers and one sister of mine saw it also and the next week of school, I found out that a classmate had witnessed it also.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

Dear Sirs:

I am inquiring about my UFO Report dated April 28, 1967. I am interested in finding out what it was. I hope you have investigated or gave it some thought. I would be very pleased if you could look up my files and tell me what your findings were.

Would you please send it to: [REDACTED], Williamstown, Mass.

Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED], dtd 17 May 1969.

1. Reference your UFO sighting of 23 April 1967 from Willimansett, Massachusetts. On the basis of your description, listed duration and flight path of the object, your sighting is being carried as possible aircraft in Project Blue Book files. It is not unusual to be able to see an aircraft but not be able to hear any noise from the engines. Your inability to hear the engine noise may have been due in large part to upper level winds.

U.F.O. Report.

My name is [REDACTED] and
my friend is [REDACTED] possible
at the at 96 placed at Willamantic
Mass and he lives at 96 Michigan
Lt. Willamantic Ct. Mass.

When I seen the object some
in my backyard near an open
field. Type of it was a clear in
the most with just a little thin
cloud formation as the last
at the time was approximately 7:35
P.M. E.S.T. Object 9-10-67. It appeared
when I first gazed at the sky,
about the same time pointed at
the star polaris at the north. It
disappeared, or I last seen it
about the horizon in the south
west. I was just moving it observed
my position before it disappeared
I looked the horizon but I didn't
a glimpse of it at the horizon.
I am not familiar with measuring
in degrees so I shall say it appeared
to be almost exactly nine polaris
the north star when I first seen
it. It disappeared at the southwest
horizon. It appeared to move.
