Dear Sir(s):

30 APR '62

I am writing to you in a somewhat hesitant manner, as in the first place, I don't know if you are still dealing in investigations of the type of phenomenon I am about to describe, and also, I don't know that it will be of any value to you. I will give you my story, and leave that up to you.

Returning home from a ride downtown last Saturday afternoon of the 28th of April, my wife and I were riding with the convertible top down. The day was clear, some clouds, but for the most part, sunny.

My wife suddenly gave a sharp exclamation, and I looked where she was pointing. At approximately a 45° angle in the sky, and almost directly to our right (North), we noticed five pearl-silvery lights, appearing round in shape, streaking across the sky, maintaining a precise formation. Their path was describing a curved line, bearing South to North, yet their glide seemed to be almost straight down as they disappeared behind the trees. I was given the impression they could have been a long way out gliding the illusion of going straight down, when actually they were paralleling the earth's surface.

Knowing that nature abhors a straight line, their formation was too precise to appear natural to me. It was a perfect square, with one green-silver object at each corner, left, and higher than the top left corner of the square. The lights traveled at such a phenomenal speed, that one only had time to see the color, direction and shape of the formation. Had we a high-speed camera, we would never have had time to focus it.

My wife's vision is very good. My vision is 20-20 corrected, and I was wearing my glasses. The day was bright, and the section of the sky where we saw the objects was cloudless. The time was about 6:40.

We are both reasonably intelligent, and not given to fantasies or hallucinations. We have absolutely no proof to substantiate our sighting, and are not even sure anyone else in Rochester or elsewhere even saw them.

I offer this information to you in the hope you might find it useful in your investigations, assuming that you are still checking out these reports.

I believe I have covered our experience fairly accurately. If you should desire to question us, please feel free to do so. I would like very much myself to learn the answer to this UFO's!

Thank You for Your Time,

Rochester, New Hampshire
