I.   PURPOSE
To determine the composition of material sent to ATIC from Syracuse, New York.

II.  FACTUAL DATA

1.   Two samples of foreign material were received and assigned Physics Laboratory Numbers 6177 and 6178.

2.   The samples were analyzed by emission spectroscopy, infrared, and X-Ray diffraction.

3.   Emission spectrochemical analysis provided these data:
     Principal - Calcium
     Majors - Silicon, magnesium, manganese, aluminum, iron, titanium, chromium
     Minor - Barium
     Traces - Nickel, copper, sodium, silver

4.   The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded and placed on file. The spectra revealed no significant absorption bands. All carbon-hydrogen linkages were very weak.

5.   X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the material is non-crystalline in structure and appears to be glass furnace slag.

III. CONCLUSIONS

Both samples appear to be of the same chemical composition.

SUBJECT: (C) Possible Foreign Space Object Material

TO: AFCIN-4E2Y (Major Friend)

1. On 25 Jun 1960, molten substance fell in the area of Syracuse, New York. These objects were turned over to the Intelligence Officer, 26th Air Division (Syracuse) and were further forwarded to AFCIN-4A as possible Moon Dust hardware. This date, 25 June, coincides with the approximate re-entry and disintegration of the Sputnik IV carrier vehicle. (CONF)

2. The material and IR were dispatched to AFCIN-4B1b for distribution to your office. Results of your analysis of this material are requested. (UNCIASS)

1. It is requested that PWS furnish a composition analysis for each sample. If the composition analysis indicates that these samples could have been from Sputnik IV, photomicrographs and interpretations of the photomicrographs should be made to show the heat transfer rates.

2. It is further requested that PWS notify this office of the total estimated cost before proceeding with this analysis.

To: -4B2c/C. A. Naugle
Through: -4B1/L. G. Whitcher pak

1. It is suggested that the two samples be subjected to a preliminary investigation consisting of (1) a microstructural analysis and, depending on the results obtained, (2) a spectrographic analysis for composition. At the conclusion of this investigation, the results would be integrated and reported to ATIC, along with recommendations, if any, for additional investigation and a cost estimate.

2. The estimated cost for the performance of the microstructural analysis is $150, and of the spectrographic analysis, $300.

3. Before proceeding with such an examination, PWS will await authorization.
