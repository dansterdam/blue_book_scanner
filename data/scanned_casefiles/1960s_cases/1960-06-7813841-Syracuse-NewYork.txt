The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The record card provides details about an incident that occurred on 25 Jun 60 in Syracuse, New York. The card indicates that the "Physical Specimen" is "Missing" and provides a brief summary of the sighting, which mentions two pieces of "colorless substance" that were forwarded for analysis.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this document. This document is an Evaluation Report from the Wright Air Development Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, analyzing foreign material received from Syracuse, New York. The report details the factual data, including the composition analysis of the two samples received, and the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

Analysis of Foreign Material

REPORT NO: WHRG FGO-26   DATE: 7 November 1960
PROJECT NO: 5771    TYPE EVALUATION:
MANUFACTURER:
SUBMITTED BY: AFCIN-4E2X

I. PURPOSE
To determine the composition of material sent to ATIC from Syracuse, New York. 

II. FACTUAL DATA
1. Two samples of foreign material were received and assigned Physics Laboratory Numbers 6177 and 6178.
2. The samples were analyzed by emission spectroscopy, infrared, and X-ray diffraction.
3. Emission spectrochemical analysis provided these data:
   Principal - Calcium
   Majors - Silicon, magnesium, manganese, aluminum, iron, titanium, chromium
   Minor - Barium
   Traces - Nickel, copper, sodium, silver
4. The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded and placed on file. The spectra revealed no significant absorption bands. All carbon-hydrogen linkages were very weak.
5. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the material is non-crystalline in structure and appears to be glass.

III. CONCLUSIONS
Both samples appear to be of the same chemical composition.

REPLY TO  
AFCIN-HA2C

SUBJECT: (C) Possible Foreign Space Object Material

TO: AFCIN-AEXK (Major Frene)

1. On 25 Jun 1960, certain substance fell in the area of Syracuse, New York. These objects were turned over to the Intelligence Officer, 507th Air Division and were forwarded to AFCIN-HA as possible Moon Dust Hardware. This date, 25 June, coincides with the landing of the Sputnik IV carrier vehicle.

2. The material and IR were dispatched to AFCIN-Hlb for distribution (this date) to your office. Results of your analysis of this material are requested. (URGENT)

WILLIAM R. VAN METER
Lt Colonel, USAF
1st Ind (AFCIN-4E20/a/CI - Hauge/67310)

TO: AFCIN-4BX-1

1. It is requested that FWS furnish a composition analysis for each sample. If the composition analyses indicate that these samples could have been from Sputnik IV, photographic and interpretations of the material should accompany the report.

2. It is further requested that FWS notify this office of the total estimated cost before proceeding with this analysis.

2nd Ind (-LBX-3/H. C. Gross)
To: -HE2C/C. A. Naugle
Through: -LBI/L. G. Whicher

1. It is suggested that the two samples be subjected to a preliminary investigation consisting of (1) a microstructural analysis and, depending on the results obtained, (2) a spectrographic analysis. It is further recommended that the condition of these samples be reported to AFSC along with recommendations, if any, for additional investigation and a cost estimate. 

2. The estimated cost for the performance of the microstructural analysis is $150, and for the spectrographic analysis, $300.

3. Before proceeding with such an examination, PWS will await authorization.
