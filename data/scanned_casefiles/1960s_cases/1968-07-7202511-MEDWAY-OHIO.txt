Observer sighted a bright white light about the same brilliance as a very bright star.

COMMENTS: A Form 117 was sent to the Observer but hasn't been returned as of 5 Sept 63. However it could be either a satellite or an aircraft. (There was an airplane with a satellite (Telstar) in the Dayton area in latter July). However, because the observer did not return the Form within 30 days the sighting is being evaluated as insufficient data.

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
