Cleveland Ufology Project
October 27, 1963

The letter of August 13, 1963, Mr. [redacted] from Twinsburg, Ohio, called to my attention an article that appeared in the morning paper. The article is enclosed with this report. The next day I stopped after work, as it was in the city where I live. This is the true account.

The actual address is [redacted], telephone [redacted], different address in paper.

I talked to Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]. Mrs. [redacted] told her neighbor who then called her friend at the Plain Dealer. Her friend's name is [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] and a photographer came to the house. Mrs. [redacted] said it (the rock) taste like salt. Mr. [redacted] called the P.A.A. from Mrs. [redacted] house. The P.A.A. told Mr. [redacted] that if it was not a part from an aircraft forget it, they were not interested. Mr. [redacted] then had a picture taken of the boy and the rock. This took place August 12.

I arrived there August 14, at about 5:40 P.M. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] were both home. They proceeded to tell me the story. I asked Mrs. [redacted] what time the rock fell, thinking it must have fallen at night. She said, "It fell between 4:10 and 4:20 P.M." W.J.T. on August 12, 1963, during a brief shower. I then asked how do you know for sure. She said before the rains came she was clearing the yard, picking up all the children's toys up. She

said "I must have passed that place twenty times". It started
to rain heavy at first then it tapered off. went
outside about twenty minutes to five. He found the rock. He
was playing with it when his mother questioned him about it.
[Redacted text] told his mother that he found it over there, pointing
to the place where it fell.

The ground appeared as if something had fallen. There was
an indention of about 1/2 inch and the size of the rock. This
is also fact because Mrs. [Redacted text] took the rock from [Redacted text] and
put it into the whole fitting it perfectly.

Well that's it, the whole story, all but one thing. So
far there has not been a complete analysis of the object. I
have given pieces to two different sources. Both failed to
make mention or contact me about it.

AMERICAN UFO COMMITTEE

29 November, 1963

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, director
Dearborn Observatory
Northeastern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I have enclosed, as you requested at our meeting last month, a full report on the "fragment" which fell near Cleveland in August. I must find this adequate for your purposes and the Air Force's. Please let us know if you decide to give the fragment to the Air Force for analysis, the next time you will visit Wright-Patterson (where was with me last month?) and I obtained most of the information.

Mr. _______ and myself, along with Mr. _______ of Atlanta, Ga., have _______ the American UFO Research Group, with a membership of about 1,000. We plan to concentrate on sightings and research rather than "sensational" reporting.

Mr. _______ told me to tell you that he has ordered a copy of the NICAP report. It was scheduled to be published this month, but, due to the death of President Kennedy, I rather doubt if it will come out any place on schedule, now for some time.

If you have any questions on this incident please let me know.

Thanking you again,

[Signature redacted]

I. PURPOSE
To conduct spectrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses to determine the chemical composition of: (1) Half round object add, (2) A crystalline compound.

II. FACTUAL DATA
1. The crystalline compound and the round object were submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch Nos. 3-1759 and 3-1807, respectively.

2. X-ray diffraction identified the crystalline compound as sodium chloride.

3. A sample was taken from the three different areas of the round object as shown in the attached photograph, and examined by emission and X-ray spectroscopy. The results are as follows:

A. Emission Analysis:
(1)                   Estimated Percentage
Element               Outside   Next Layer   Inside
Silicon               .05        .05         -6
Magnesium             .01        .01         1.0
