1. On 5 June 1965 at 0436 Zulu TSgt Eaton, Roland C., AF13306281,
and AIC Watt, W. G., AF13541825, both Air Traffic Controllers in 1943d
Communication Squadron at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, (during
their tour at the control tower) reported sighting an object passing
over the south end of runway 22. The object was at an altitude of two
to three thousand feet, on a north to south course, and traveling at a
high rate of speed.

2. The object was a white light about the size of a half-dollar.
Sgt Eaton and Airman Watt said that it was moving faster than any jet
aircraft they had ever seen. It was visible for 3 to 4 seconds and
then disappeared to the south. They were unable to use any optical
aids on-the object due to its speed. The object left no trail-or
exhaust and no noise was heard.

3. The observers, both of whom seem highly reliable, stated that the
weather from the tower appeared to be clear with 5 to 8 miles visibility.

4. The following information was obtained from 3d Weather Squadron,
Detachment 20, Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, for the period
from 0330Z to 0500Z: It was clear with seven miles visibility. Winds
on the ground were 100° at 3 knots and remained from same direction
and increased in velocity to 13 knots at ten thousand (10,000) feet.
Temperature at ground level was 60°F and decreased 19° per thousand
feet from ground up.

5. There were no unusual activities or reported traffic in the area
at the time of the sighting.

6. The investigating officer, 1st Lt Harold D. Eastridge, Navigator,
778 Troop Carrier Squadron, Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, states
that there is no physical evidence available on the sighting, and that
after researching the possibilities of weapons firing in the area,
weather data, and astronomical data, that he is unable to ascertain
any logical explanation of the sighting.
