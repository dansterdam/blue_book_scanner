1. On 9 June 1965 at 0245 ZULU, Capt. Robert Tatge Bacon, Roland G. AP133*, and Alc Watt, W. G., AP135*1823, both Air Traffic Controllers, Communication Controllers, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, observed an unidentified object over the south end of runway 22. The object was at an altitude to 3 to 4 thousand feet moving in a south-easterly direction.

2. The object was a white light, about the size of a half-dollar, that it was pulsating. It was moving faster than any aircraft they had ever seen. It was visible for 3 to 4 seconds, then disappeared. No sound was heard.

3. The observers, whose names seem highly reliable, stated that the weather from the tower appeared to be clear with 3 to 5 miles visibility.

4. The following information was obtained from 1st Lieutenant Detachment 20, Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, for the period of 0305Z to 0350Z: The object was observed with several minutes, with increasing luminosity, and increased its velocity to 13 knots at ten thousand (10,000) feet and decreased 15,000 feet.

5. There were no unusual activities or reported traffic in the area at this time.

6. The investigating officer, 1st Lt. Harold D. Easteridge, was unable to find any physical evidence available on the sighting, and was unable to associate any logical explanation for the sighting.
