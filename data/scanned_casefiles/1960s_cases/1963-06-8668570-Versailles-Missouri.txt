A SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE CALL. THE RELIABILITY OF [REDACTED] AND
FAMILY CANNOT BE DETERMINED. IN OBTAINING THE WEATHER DATA FROM
WHITEMAN AFB, THEWEATHER OFFICER SUGGESTED IT COULD HAVE BEEN A
WEATHER BALLON WITH A LIGHT. THIS WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE TWENTY MINUTE
SIGHTNER, ZIG-ZAGGING AND SPEED-UP AND SLOW-DOWN. THIS COULD ALSO
ACCOUNT FOR THE BRIGHT, THEN DIM, LIGHT AS THE INSTRUMENT PACKAGE
WAS SWINGING UNDER THE BALLOON.

The document appears to be a log or record with repeated entries that follow a similar pattern. Most lines contain text like:

NORTH OF CITY, XX DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON MOVING SE

Where XX is a number representing degrees, and "SE" likely means "Southeast". The entries seem to be recording observations of something (possibly an object or phenomenon) at different times, with consistent notation about its position relative to the city and its movement direction.

The text is typewritten and appears to be from an older document, with some slight variations in clarity and darkness of the text. The page is numbered with "G1", "G2", and "G3" at the bottom of different sections.

The document is a black and white scanned image with some slight degradation and edge artifacts typical of older scanned documents.
