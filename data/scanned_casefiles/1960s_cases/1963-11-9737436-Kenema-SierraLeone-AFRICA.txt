Kenema, Sierra Leone
28th. Nov. 1963

Dear Sir,

I wish to report, or enquire after (whichever is the more appropriate) an object in the sky at 19:25 G.M.T. on 27th. Nov. 1963. This passed over Kenema from the West, travelling at a speed one normally associates with a low flying air-craft. The object appeared to be giving out light at regular intervals. The final effect was very supernatural, with a large bright halo, larger than the halo seen around the moon at times. The light given out somehow was dispersed by the slight cloud cover to give the impression of ripples as from a stone in a pond. This caused havoc in the town, with many people sleeping in the mosque or turning till dawn. Here hoping you will be able to satisfy the curiosity of many people.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of November 23, 1953, in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object on November 27th.

We wish to thank you for making this report to our Government. That you was an Atlas/Centaur-2 missile which was launched from Cape Kennedy at 7:03 GMT, to place a satellite in orbit. This missile was also observed as it passed over Monrovia, Liberia.

It is most regretted that this object may have caused undue consternation, and we hope that this explanation will alleviate any doubt as to its origin.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
