Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

There are several things I want to talk about:

1. I have an appointment with Major Dolloros at O'Hare on Wednesday April 28. They couldn't make it sooner because of an OK. Whatever that means, but I understand it is some sort of a Purdy instruction. I will take up the more of our long range reporting (diplomatically, of course). Particularly, I will take up the Rockford, Illinois case with him.

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS
May 25, 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
P.O. Box 9494
FTD Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing a copy of a letter from the Smithsonian giving the object sighted which was a brighter than magnitude Chara (3). Could you ask Hartley to locate a copy for me? I am not near our machine now. As you see, there are eleven (11) objects that are of magnitude one (1) or brighter.

I would like to report also on my visit to O'Hare Air Force Squadron. I had a long discussion with Major Dallaporto and he informed me to go to problem after awhile. I discussed with him at length the Air Force's problem and gave him examples of good reports and bad reports, pointing out that many of our endeavors of insufficient information could have been solved if more information had been immediately available. I think he understands now the importance of our statistics, and that far greater detail must be supplied with his reports.

He said he had not the least idea that this matter was so important and could do no more than refer me to Frank of the local newspaper. He said he had never received any information as to the progress of the program, nor did he have any suggestion which might have something to it: how about a "UFO newsletter", sent to all bases on an occasional basis. I pointed out that the fact sheet basically served this purpose, but he still felt that the inter-office type of memo aimed at the investigators and not at the public would be of tremendous help.

I think the idea has possibilities, especially if the newsletter could contain an account of a particular sighting which was solved because of quick action on the part of the Air base to which it was reported. In short, some praise as well as criticism.

I think Dallaporto's key words might be taken to heart: "I didn't know anyone took this seriously."

I forgot to ask you how your new son is getting on. But I assume that everything is just fine.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
J. Allen Hynek
