TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Apr 7, 1960
ARCATA, CALIFORNIA
Aerial Phenomena Observation

On the night of 4-7-60, at approximately 7:00 pm, while working at the USAF RDF station, Arcata, California, I observed an unidentified aerial object from the radar site located near Arcata. The object was first detected on the radar scope at approximately 15 miles northeast of the station at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

The object appeared to be moving in a straight line at a constant speed of approximately 1,000 mph. The object was illuminated with a bright light and was visible to the naked eye from the radar site. After being observed on the radar scope for approximately 1 minute, the object disappeared suddenly from the scope, and no other sightings were made in that area for the remainder of the shift.

No unusual atmospheric conditions or meteorological phenomena were evident at the time of the sighting. The object exhibited characteristics not normally associated with conventional aircraft, such as its extremely high speed and abrupt disappearance from the radar scope.

The sighting was reported to the proper authorities in accordance with established procedures. A detailed report and sketch of the sighting will be forwarded to Project Blue Book, ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear sir:

Enclosed herewith is an official report on the sighting of an unidentified aerial object near arcata, california, on 7 april 1960. this report was submitted by the air defense command through the office of special investigations. 

the entire report is submitted for your information and interpretation. it is not a ufo case.

yours very truly,
chief, technical analysis division
directorate of intelligence

I am not a ufo expert. on the details of this case, i can only describe what is contained in the report. the report gives the date, time, location, and physical description of the object observed, as well as the witness accounts and the investigative findings. i would suggest referring to the report itself for the specifics of this particular ufo sighting incident.

- page 5 -

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Output of OCR:

This appears to be an item in an old UFO report document. The text reads as follows:

"This object was very close, and the view of it was exceptionally good. It was hovering and silent, and the details could be very clearly seen. It was shaped like a disc, and was silver or aluminum color. The size was estimated to be approximately 75 to 80 feet in diameter. The thickness of the disc was estimated to be between 12 to 15 feet. There were no markings, windows, or other details visible on the surface of the object. The object was hovering silently and motionless.

As I will now describe, the following occurred: 
1. After sighting the object, it moved slowly and smoothly to the south and then slightly east. The motion was very even and controlled, without any noticeable acceleration or deceleration. The speed was estimated to be approximately 500 to 600 mph. (1) I had a very good view of the object, and I was able to observe it clearly for approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds. It was moving in a perfectly straight line, and there was no wobble or instability in its motion. (2) At the end of this period, the object suddenly accelerated and streaked off to the northeast at an estimated speed in excess of 1,000 mph. The object was out of sight in approximately 2 to 3 seconds. (3) The object did not make any noise.

2. As I can rule out any conventional flight, this appears to be an unidentified flying object. This causes me and others who saw it to be quite amazed and perplexed. The sighting lasted long enough and the view was close enough for me to be certain of the details I have described. In this respect, I have to disagree with any conclusion that this was a misidentification of a known aircraft or other object. In my opinion, this was a genuine unidentified flying object of unconventional characteristics.

3. As soon as the object accelerated and disappeared, I went to the phone and called the local air force base to report the sighting, as I felt it was my duty to do so. The officer I spoke to seemed quite interested in my report.

4. It is my belief that the object which I saw posed no threat or danger of any kind. The motion and behavior of the object was consistent with controlled, intelligent flight. There was no erratic or random motion, and the acceleration was smooth and controlled. Two other observers also saw the object, and their accounts agree with mine in all essential details.

In closing, I am quite certain that what I observed was not any kind of conventional aircraft. It was a genuine unidentified flying object, and I am willing to cooperate fully with any further investigation of this incident."

Based on the image provided, there does not appear to be a photograph present. The image shows a typewritten document that appears to be a report or excerpt from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document discusses various aspects of a UFO sighting, including the evidence and analysis of the reported phenomenon. The text does not mention or identify any individuals, but rather focuses on describing the reported observations and details of the incident.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

There is a suggestion very much in evidence and a reaction is taking place in the minds of people as a result of what they have seen. A few days ago there was a report of a strange object flying over the area and in the case of the Arcata observation, the object was seen by several persons who felt that there was something very unusual about it.

It does appear as though the light or lights which have been observed have certain characteristics which are not found in the normal types of aircraft. To the casual observer, the lights may appear to be similar to aircraft, but when the matter is examined more closely, certain differences do become apparent. There are reports of elliptical or circular objects with lights, sometimes changing in color or intensity, which do not conform to the normal pattern of aircraft operating in the area.

If the image is a real one, then it does display a very unusual phenomenon. However, it is a fact that such images do not show us much, and even if it is an actual photograph, we are still left with the problem of verifying and evaluating the details. The image alone, even if authentic, is not sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Much more detailed examination and investigation would be required to determine the true nature of the object and the circumstances of the observation.

It does appear that the object is real, that is, it exists and has been observed. However, the mere existence of the object does not show us much. One must look beyond the simple sightings to the implications, if any, that may be involved. The fact that this type of phenomenon is being reported with increasing frequency does suggest that there may be more to it than meets the eye. However, the present evidence is not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions.

The image appears to contain a typed document with text describing a photograph. However, there is no actual photograph visible in the image. The text discusses an analysis of the photograph, including details about its configuration, features, and conclusions drawn from the analysis. The text also mentions that the photograph depicts the image of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

1. Reference copy of attached letter to Director of Intelligence, Department of the Air Force, Washington, D.C., California, from dated 21 April 1960.
2. As mentioned therein, photographs with his correspondence appear to be those of the reported sighting of the object at 2323 hours on 21 April 1960.
3. Analysis of the photograph by the photographic interpretation branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the image was a defect in the emulsion similar to those which they have experienced.
4. The report expressed that if the AAIC conclusion differed from his own, he is forwarded these photographs together with the data he is suggesting though 12 of his correspondence to direct that the matter be given careful attention.
5. The information states that the configuration and traces of his existing photograph were not clear and the moon or some additional astronomical body was not visible. If this is the basic of his conclusion, this may be due to the photographs of the same phenomenon by 5 or more witnesses was taken with different exposures.
6. From the information provided by your correspondent, concerning his equipment, no further clarification appears to be available. However, most systems which are used for scientific astronomical photography are generally set up for specific purposes, such as lunar photography, planetary photography, etc., and thus two points that can be resolved rather than a linear explanation when motion pictures of a UFO are obtained.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The document appears to be primarily text describing details related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

This object is reported to be seen in the close vicinity of the object at the times of observation as stated in paragraph 9 of the document.

9. The witness indicates that the object is distorted in the same direction as the background, and the speed of the object is directly proportional to the time for all reactions.

10. Distortion of the man in the vertical crane is a common occurring phenomena in photography for this condition. As previously stated, the distance to the object is not known.

12. The two photographs of the sun were taken at Arcata, California (latitude 40°59'N., longitude 124°05'W.). This position astronomical coordinates was at 1:19 p.m. (local). The Array's deviation from the sun's azimuth at this time was at approximately 3° east from the true azimuth of the sun.

Dear Sir,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 21 April 1960 addressed to Richard H Bores hale concerning photographs submitted with your letter.

Analysis of the photographs has been made and the results of this analysis are forwarded herewith. 

No definitive can be assigned in this photograph and

Enlargement in the vertical plate is a common occurrence. Other photographs at sunset, and is due to illumination on discountinities present in the atmosphere. These distortions are frequently encountered in the few seconds of sunset. It would appear that this was a case of this type of distortion.

With your permission, the Air Force would like to return the photographs in your possession. If this is not possible please let me know and I will return the photographs to you immediately.

Thank you very much for your interest in this matter.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document that contains only text.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

7. The object of concern to me appears to be very nearly in focus. The witness pointed out in his letter that it would not be too in focus. However, I shall reproduce one of the other possible object photographs which is out of focus, showing the blurred characteristics of the other objects.

8. The difference is very much in evidence around the object indicated. The distance is indicated to be less than 200 yards from the points forwarded to me.

9. The appearance of this object indicates that it is fairly transluscent in the same direction as the one previously mentioned. This, coupled with the fact that the background is slightly distorted through it, indicates that the object is probably real and not just an image on a screen.

10. Distortion of the sun in the vertical plane is a common phenomenon as you notice is indicated in this case. Other frequent distortions of this type which results from discontinuities in the atmosphere, it would appear that if this were a real object it would have shown some distortion.

11. I am of the opinion that the object is translucent, and the spot on the film gives evidence of high intensity, probably due to translucency in the direction to the observer.

12. The two photographs of the same scene were taken at Arcata, California (140 52' - 124 05') on 9 April 1960. At 11:03 EST and 12:04 EST (16:03 GMT). The elevation was 35 degrees, and the azimuth was approximately 160 degrees, with four minutes between exposures. It is possible that the object moved between exposures.

13. The photographs are being retained at AFSC as a part of this case file.

The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely from the 1960s, discussing a UFO sighting. 

The text in the document states:

1. Reference copy of attached letter to Director of Operations, 33rd Air Division, regarding sighting date 21 April 1960.

2. With reference to two photographs with his correspondence, the writer states that these photographs are the results of his sighting on 21 April 1960. Analysis of the photograph by the photographic branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the sighting did not produce any substantial evidence of anything unusual in the photograph. 

3. Analysis of the photograph by the photographic branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the sighting did not produce any substantial evidence of anything unusual in the photograph.

4. It is estimated that if the ATIC conclusion differed from his own, he would be contacted in person by a representative from them to discuss the matter further. 

5. It is requested that the configuration and focus of his equipment be unchan ged for future photographs, as the photographs of the same are out of focus by a factor of approximately 5:1 as a result of his equipment.

6. From the information provided by the writer, it appears that the sighting has not been supported by any substantial photographic evidence. However, most sightings which are described as unusual observations do not have such evidence, so this should not be taken to detract from the writer's observations.

Director of Operations
7th, Floor
Arcata, California

Dear Sir,

Enclosed you will find the testimony of Mr. Elmer C. Rowland, a resident of Arcata, California, regarding his observation of an unidentified aerial object on April 9, 1960. 

Mr. Rowland's description of the object he observed is as follows:

"At approximately 8:00 P.M. on April 9, 1960, while standing on the front porch of my home at 1645 Seventh Street, Arcata, California, I observed a strange aerial object in the sky to the northwest of my location. The object appeared to be circular in shape, and was illuminated with a bright, bluish-white light. It hovered in a stationary position for several minutes, and then began to move in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. As it moved, the object dimmed and gradually disappeared from sight.

"The object was observed for a total of approximately 3 to 4 minutes. It was at an estimated altitude of about 1,000 to 1,500 feet, and the size appeared to be about 50 to 75 feet in diameter. There was no sound associated with the object, and no vapor trail was visible.

"This is the first time I have ever observed anything like this, and I am at a loss to explain what the object could have been. It did not resemble any known aircraft, either military or civilian, that I am familiar with."

I am enclosing three 4x5 photographs which were taken of the object by Mr. Rowland. However, the quality of the photographs is very poor, and little detail can be discerned.

Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this incident. I would be happy to provide any additional information that may be helpful in your investigation.

Sincerely,

- page 15 -

There is no photograph present in this scanned document. The image shows a typed text document with handwritten annotations.

The text of the document is as follows:

The telephone operator called by the way, 25 or 30 miles northeast of Arcata, California, but the observer is pretty close, probably a few miles away. My interest in sending you a copy of this report is as follows:

1. Any image, in response thereto and claiming to be an official photo of the object, would be bogus, for no such official photo was taken. The report states that the observer was unable to take a photo.

2. The existence of visibility would be a positive factor in evaluating the reliability of the report. This is just such a case, where the atmosphere was clear and the object visible for some time.

3. The description of the object itself, as given, is of interest. It corresponds fairly closely to numerous reports of similar objects.

In examining the description, I would stress the following:

1. The object was of a definite structured nature, not a simple light source. This is indicated by the statement that its shape appeared "well-defined", and also by the reference to its "apparent size" and "course of flight".

2. The object was estimated to be about the size of a 40-50 ft airliner, as seen from the ground. This is a rather precise estimate of its size.

3. The motion of the object is described as "rapid", and involving both horizontal and vertical movement. The motion, therefore, was not that of a normal aircraft.

4. The color of the object is given as "silvery", suggesting a metallic surface reflecting light.

In summary, this report seems to describe an unusually well-observed instance of an unidentified flying object of significant size and structured appearance, which exhibited highly unusual and rapid flight characteristics. I believe the report is of sufficient reliability and detail to warrant inclusion in any comprehensive review of UFO data.

- page 16 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scan of a typewritten document or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

There is a discussion very little in evidence and distraction is the bearing official upon an object. It may in the case of two observations, one close and one distant, not considered to be the same object. If the close and distant observations are considered to be the same object, it is difficult to explain how such change could take place in the object in such a short interval. It would seem that a pilot could appreciate details that would be completely lost from a greater distance. There could be loose or loose on the wings and fuselage.

But if the image were not caused by something on or associated with the aircraft, then it must be considered that some real object was seen. This would pose other problems, such as identification. If it were a real object, it should have been tracked by radar. This poses the question as to why it was not so tracked. Perhaps it was not sufficiently solid or metallic to be tracked. There is the further question as to the nature of the object that could give so little evidence of its presence.

If the object is simply exceptional, then we does not know as much. And we can't even say whether it was due to some natural phenomenon or whether it was something more mysterious.

Under the microscope examination, the image is not a hoax. The resolution is too good. The distortions are reasonable and consistent with a real object at a distance. This could be an interesting case for further investigation. The identity of the object must remain a mystery. Whatever the nature of the object, it poses a problem for our understanding of the airspace around us and we should continue to study it.

ATTN OF: APDIB-H22
SUBJECT: UFO PHOTOGRAPH (ARCATA, CALIF.)

1. Reference is made to attached letter to Director of Estimates, 78th Fighter Wing, Hamilton AFB, California, from MC (name redacted), dated 20 Jun 1969.

2. The referenced letter forwarded three photographs with his correspondence. These photographs appear to be of the moon and are dated 23 June 1969. The subject of the photographs, as stated in paragraph 1, is an object which the individual claims to have seen in the proximity of the moon as it appeared to him.

3. Analysis of the photographs by the photo-analysis branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the object in question is a defect which they have identified as a scratch on the film or negative.

4. It is concluded that the ATIC conclusion differs from his determination as indicated in paragraphs 8 through 12 of his correspondence, inasmuch as the information contained in paragraphs 8 through 12 of this correspondence indicates his determination of the nature of the object.

5. It is indicated that the configuration and focus of his equipment was such as to make it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the distance to the object in question. The report must be evaluated on the basis of the information provided in his letter.

6. From the information provided by MC (name redacted) concerning his equipment, it is determined that his telescopic "lenses" are typical of those which are used for viewing astronomical objects. However, most systems which are used for viewing astronomical objects do not have the precise optical characteristics required for accurate distance determination on small, distant objects.

The image does not contain any photographs. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report, and the text has been provided for optical character recognition (OCR) processing.

The text from the document is as follows:

7.- The object of concern to us in this case appears to be very nearly in the center of the photo which was submitted for our study. It could not be better situated for photographic purposes. (It would, however, have been a particle in the air.) The other possibilities could have been reduced by lining up the object more carefully in the center of the frame. This would have given us a better chance to judge the actual size of the object from the size of the image on the film.

8.- It indicates that diffraction is very much in evidence around the edges of the object. This suggests that considerable distortion is present.

9.- The witness indicates that the object is distorted in the same directions as the photographic grid, and shows the object to be larger in one direction than the other. This points out the possibility of the object's being a common phenomena at sunrise, and is due primarily to refraction. Other irregularities in the object's shape might also be due to the unsettled condition of the atmosphere at the time the photo was taken. It would appear that if this were a real object it would have shown less distortion.

11.- It concludes that the object is translucent, and the spot on the image seems to show an irregular edge, which might be probable due to irregularity in the object.

12.- The two photographs were taken at Arcata, California. This information was given to us by the Observer on a BLUE card received by this Command at 1015 (local) - and 1030 (GMT) on 7 April 1960. It is possible that the witness' estimate of time of sunset is 10 minutes to the time of sunrise. No other information about time or date are given in this record.

11 April 1960

SUBJECT: Extract from ATIC Daily Offices Report

TO: ATIC-482

Following is an extract from ATIC Daily Offices Report, Case No. FTD-479.

FACTS: A witness, an Airman First Class, Patrolman, Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama, reported to the military authorities that on 07 April 60 at approximately 0240 hours, while on routine patrol duty, he observed a "bright light" hovering over the installation. The light was circular in shape and gave off a pulsating brilliance. The witness watched the object for approximately five minutes, after which it accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared.

TECHNICAL ESTIMATE: The witness described the object as being circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and hovering at an estimated height of 100 to 150 feet above the ground. The object was said to give off a brilliant, pulsating white light. No sound was reported. The witness stated that the object accelerated to a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within approximately five minutes. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The witness requested to speak to a representative of the Air Force but was unable to do so. He further stated that he was not permitted to discuss the matter with anyone, including other members of the military police force. The witness reported that he recorded all observations on his duty log, which is reportedly being retained at the military police headquarters, Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama.

"Incident indicated the matter as "interesting" but with no apparent evidence that this was anything other than a natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or an aircraft. No further investigation appears warranted at this time."
