AT QUESTION 26 I SAID THE RESEMBLED PARACHUTES. HERE IS NOW I KNOW THAT THEY WERE NOT PARACHUTES. ① THE LOWER EDGE WAS NOT "SCALLOPED"- THAT IS, A PARACHUTE LOOKS LIKE THIS: [hand-drawn diamond/parachute shape] WHILE "MY" UFO'S - LOOKED LIKE THIS: [hand-drawn different shape] ALSO, NOTE NO. SHROUD LINES. ② HERE WAS A WIND, BUT THEY (THE UFOS) WERE PERFECTLY STEADY. ③ THE UFOS HELD A PERFECT "VEE" FORMATION WITH ONE IN THE CENTER, AND ④ THEY DRIFTED ACROSS THE WIND. ④

ALSO, TO DISAPPEAR THEY DRIFTED BEHIND THE TREES BEHIND OUR HOUSE ONCE. AT THIS POINT I RAN INTO THE HOUSE TO GET MY FIELD GLASSES AND DID NOT SEE THEM AGAIN. RAY, HOWEVER, SAW THEM AGAIN LIKE SO: AFTER THEY DRIFTED BEHIND THE TREES HE RAN TO OUR NEIGHBORS BACK FENCE TO SEE IF HE COULD SEE THEM FROM THERE. HE COULDN'T SO HE RETURNED TO THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE AND THEY WERE BACK IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS. THEY DRIFTED BEHIND THE TREES ONCE MORE AND DID NOT REAPPEAR.
