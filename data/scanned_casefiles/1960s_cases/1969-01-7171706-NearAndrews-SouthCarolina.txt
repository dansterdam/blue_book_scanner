Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter of January 22, 1969, in which you state you and some friend have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to take an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book we are enclosing.

Sincerely,
/s/

Dear Sir:

Last night (January 21) my friend, his father, and I were driving home in a car when we saw a UFO. It was of a bright orange color and was shaped like a crescent moon. It was about fifty feet above the ground and appeared to be the length of three cars. We were within a mile of this flying object and it traveled from left side of the road to the right and left again to the right. After this it seemed to hover, vanished. We saw it somewhere between 9:30 P.M. and 9:35 P.M. (EST). Three years.
