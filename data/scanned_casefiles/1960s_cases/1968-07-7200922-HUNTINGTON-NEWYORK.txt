    INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    The observer sighted a star-like white light that appeared similar to a satellite.

    COMMENTS: The Observer said that the New York Times did not list any visible satellites for that night. Since there are well over 150 satellites and associated objects, that are visible to the naked eye the New York Times would list them all. The duration and direction were not stated. Therefore, the observer was requested to complete a form 117. This form has been returned as of 4 Sep 1968.

FORM
FTD SEP 63 0-329 (TDE)   Previous editions of this form may be used.

Dear [redacted]

Your letter of July 22, 1960, addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in which you described a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO), has been referred to this office.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

July 22, '63

Dear Sirs,

If you'd like some information on U. F. O.'s I'm July 22, '63 I saw one. It was very small. It wasn't a comet or a meteor any more than it got good or a meteorite. Because it didn't have a tail on it and it didn't blink out. It just faded away like an airplane going out of sight except it wasn't an airplane because it was a white light and it didn't blink. It looked like a satellite except it wasn't because I could see the New York Times (a newspaper) under it. Satellites and it had nothing about

Here is the text from the document:

The Times said when and where you could find them, and it was in the middle of the sky and usually it would find it in the east horizon or the west horizon.

Your friend,

I saw the U.F.O. about 1:30 in
