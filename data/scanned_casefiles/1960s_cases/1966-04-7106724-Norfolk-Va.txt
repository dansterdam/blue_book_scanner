Here is the text from the document:

(4) When first sighted, the object appeared to be bouncing or oscillating until it was directly in front of the observer, where it seemed to stop and hover. A small, brilliant light appeared to leave the bottom of the larger object and descend into the water, where it was no longer visible. The larger object then appeared to descend and hover over the spot where the smaller object had entered the water. It then climbed straight up to approximately the position of the first hover and hovered once more.

(5) Upon completion of the second hover, the object started climbing at approximately a 60° angle. Acceleration seemed slow at first, but rapidly increased until the object disappeared from view.

(6) Object was visible for 5 to 6 minutes.
