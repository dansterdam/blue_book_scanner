27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

It made an even arc across the sky with two changes in direction.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Just one

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent:

Neither my husband nor I have ever been subject to hallucinations of any kind nor are we likely to report anything that did not seem extremely extraordinary to us as we both know how many things can contribute to the appearance of an unfamiliar object (balloons, gases, etc.) However, nothing in our sub minds could explain what we saw. Also, I have flown in planes many times and my husband was in the Air Force, thus giving him a knowledge of many types of aircraft.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
Several days   July   1967
Day   Month   Year
After the sighting (2-3 days)

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    22     July     67
     Day           Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

One thing that was not clearly defined was that the object we saw, which appeared as a bright light, went off and on as it traveled across the sky. The periods of illumination were approximately 5-8 seconds apart, and very even. It had no color and no resemblance whatsoever to an airplane lights - being much larger and what appeared to be a complete object unto itself (no outline of anything around it.)

There were search lights in the sky that might have we were certain it was not one of those because it shad no beam connected to it and was intermittent in its flashing. We are certain it was not a plane because it must have been flying low to get under the cloud cover and yet there was no sound. It was also traveling too rapidly for any plane we know of, had no vapor trail and managed to cross the entire sky in little after the minute. It did not look anything at all like a missile, a comet or a satellite.

FROM : Chief, Charlottesville FSS

TO : James C. Manatt, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems

In reference to the UFO sighting near Dyke, Virginia, there is no Control Tower at Charlottesville, Va. There is an FAA, Flight Service Station located here, which would have made an observation much more difficult. Our records show no UFO calls were made to this facility on that date.

Sorry, we are unable to provide you with any additional information as to the possible cause of the sighting.

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low-quality, blurry document with a grid-like structure. While there is text present, it is almost entirely illegible due to the poor scan quality and heavy distortion. I can make out that it seems to be some kind of form or table, but I cannot confidently transcribe any specific text from this image.


- page 9 -

The image appears to be a data table or ledger page with multiple columns and rows. Most of the text is small and difficult to read clearly due to the low contrast and image quality. The document looks like a dense numerical or financial record with many rows of numbers and possibly some text entries. However, due to the poor image resolution, I cannot confidently transcribe specific text or numbers from the page.


- page 10 -

The image appears to be a detailed ledger or accounting page with multiple columns and rows of handwritten numbers. Due to the low contrast and image quality, many of the specific numbers and text are difficult to read clearly. The page has three hole punches on the right side, indicating it was likely part of a bound document or report. The text and numbers are densely packed into a grid-like format, suggesting this is some form of financial or statistical record.

Dist. Rec. Report - Copy all for Hq.

The Blue Ridge School
Dyke, Virginia 22935

Unidentified Flying Objects Division
United States Defense Department
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs:

We are not sure if such an individual account would be helpful to you or not, but my husband and I thought we would report an extremely unusual sight which we saw in the sky last night, and which was unlike anything we had ever seen before.

We are residing temporarily (until August 6) at the Blue Ridge School which is 15 miles north west of Charlottesville, Virginia near the small towns of Dyke and Standardsville. At approximately (and we are not sure of the exact time) 10:30-11:00 p.m. last night, my husband and I were sitting outside the school building when we first sighted a bright, flashing object moving very rapidly across the sky.

This object seemed to both of us to be a very strong burst of light that came out of a regular interval -- about five seconds apart, and moved in what we sensed to be a very straight line across the sky. Then horizontal to our direction. In our direction of observation, we had only one area of discernment, and it appeared to be distinctly oval to me and shaped like a saucer. This was the only area we could notice, and it seemed to be to him only a "flash of light."

I would not be writing this note except for the unusual character of the object we saw. The cloud ceiling was low, and the object moved below this ceiling. It was certainly within small increments of our vision. If I would guess, it not 1000 feet. The flashes of light that it emitted were exceedingly bright, although they did not light up the sky, but only their own area.


- page 12 -

The image appears to be a complex document with multiple grid-like sections and tables. At the top right of the document, I can partially make out the text "ATLANTIC CHART". Most of the text on the page is too small or blurry to read clearly. The document seems to be a detailed chart or log with numerous rows and columns of data, with some sections appearing to contain numerical or coded information. The image is a black and white scanned document with varying levels of contrast and legibility.


- page 13 -

I apologize, but I cannot discern any readable text on this page. The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with a complex grid pattern, but the text within the grid cells is too blurry or low resolution to read. The document looks like a data sheet or chart with numerous small squares, but the specific content is not legible.


- page 14 -

Much of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a form or report with a grid-like structure on the left side and several text boxes on the right side. However, the text within these boxes is too blurry and faded to be accurately transcribed.


- page 15 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a heavily gridded document with very low contrast and significant image degradation. While there is clearly text present within the grid, the resolution and quality make the text almost entirely illegible. I cannot confidently OCR any specific words or sentences from this image.


- page 16 -

At the top of the page, I can clearly see "ADIABATIC CHART" printed.

Most of the document appears to be a complex grid or chart with numerous rows and columns filled with numerical data. The image is a black and white scanned document with varying levels of legibility due to the scanning quality.

On the right side of the document, there are some sections with text, but most of it is too blurry or faint to read with certainty. I can make out some words like "LEGEND" and "REMARKS" but cannot confidently transcribe the full text.

The document seems to be some kind of technical or scientific chart, possibly related to meteorological or thermodynamic data, given the "ADIABATIC CHART" title.


- page 17 -

The image appears to be a grid or chart with vertical and horizontal lines forming numerous rectangular cells. The document is a black and white scanned page with some faint markings and numbers along the left margin (14, 15, 16, 17, etc.). The grid is dense and covers most of the page, with some diagonal lines crossing through the grid cells. Due to the low contrast and image quality, most of the text within the grid cells is illegible.

This "object" did not seem to emit any sort of beam,
