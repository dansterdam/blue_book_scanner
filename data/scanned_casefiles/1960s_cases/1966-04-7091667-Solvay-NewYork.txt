- page 1 -

At the top of the document, there are two headers:
"AF"
"(UFO)"

The rest of the text is handwritten, but parts of it are difficult to read clearly. The text appears to be a form or questionnaire with numbered lines, but only fragments of text are legible. A portion of the text has been redacted with a black line.

The handwriting is cursive and somewhat faint, making complete OCR challenging. Some words can be partially made out, but not with complete certainty.
