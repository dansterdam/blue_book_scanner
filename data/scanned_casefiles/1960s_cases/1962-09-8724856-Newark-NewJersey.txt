The text visible in the document is as follows:

"The rather unusual picture comes to this picture that was found around 1.5 miles in the direction of Woodbridge, RJ. 8.15p.m. The report states that he was watching the stars about 1/2 mile away from the airstrip of the Bridgeport, OF Airport when he observed the objects appear and remaining stationary for several minutes before disappearing very rapidly. He states that he has had the experience of seeing this incident occur on several occasions and that he has reported this phenomenon to the authorities in the past. The pictures were taken with a Brownie Hawkeye camera using standard 620 film. The report further states that the picture depicts the facts as the witness observed them within the time in question."

The image appears to be a handwritten document, but it does not contain any visible photograph.

Performing OCR on the text:

Dear Mr. Baker,
I regret to inform you that I cannot provide the object that you requested, as it was confiscated of my private property collection and labeled for further analysis and study. I was not made aware of the reasons why the object was taken, or who authorized the action. 
I was considering sending the object to you on request, as I had planned to do so, but alas it is no longer in my possession. I do hope that this does not cause you too much inconvenience. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist with.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
