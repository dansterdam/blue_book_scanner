UFO Observation

San Francisco, California  94117

1. Reference your letter of 1 September 1968. We do try to notify the observer of our findings whenever possible, however, because of the large number of reports and our limited staff we cannot always do so. If you would complete the enclosed AF Form 117 on your recent observation, we will try to identify the enclosure if possible.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
