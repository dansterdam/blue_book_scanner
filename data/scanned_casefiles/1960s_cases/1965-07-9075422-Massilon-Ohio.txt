The Akron Canton Airport is approximately 15 miles from here and the planes often come over the house. On the fourth of July, the sky was a vivid blue and the object was about as high as a plane and would be if it were going to land. I wish I could draw both because it was very plain where I saw it and quite large.

Thursday, July 15
Massillon, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am writing in regards to the flying saucer which may have landed in a wheat field in Carroll County.

At approximately 8:40 A.M. on July 14, I saw a saucer. I was in the back yard with a cup of coffee. The sky was bright blue, and the U.F.O. was plainly visible, as it wasn't flying at a high altitude, but was flying fairly fast.

I told my neighbors about it 10 minutes later that I saw it. I also told 4 other people the same day.

Two days ago I read in the paper about the sport in Joe Stiver's at what.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Massillon, Ohio
