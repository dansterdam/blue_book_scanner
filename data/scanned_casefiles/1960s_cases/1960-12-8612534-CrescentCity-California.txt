OFFICER OF DAY, 1LT JOHN D LANGIE, ORGN MAINT OFFICER. FROM THE TELLTATION OF HIS SECTION OF THE SURE THAT HE OBSERVED SOME TYPE OF UNUSUAL PHENOMENA. HE SOUNDED VERY RELIABLE. I CAN THINK OF NO CAUSE FOR HIS SIGHTING UNLESS IT WAS A METEOR OR HOWEVER, THE WEATHER AS REPORTED TO ME BY THE PET 2 RATHER SECTION FOR CRESCENT CITY WAS NO WIND, NO CEILING. VISIBILITY 15 MILES, AND SINCE IT WAS 1749 AND DUSK THIS SEEMS TO BE A GUESS AT MOST SINCE I THINK.

METEOR COULD BE EASILY IDENTIFIED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. SINCE TWO PEOPLE OBSERVED THIS OBJECT, IT IS LIKELY THAT A UFO WAS SIGHTED AT 1749 AT CRESCENT CITY, CALIF. PARA L. N/A
