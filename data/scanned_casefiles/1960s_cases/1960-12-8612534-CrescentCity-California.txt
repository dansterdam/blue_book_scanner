OFFICER OF DAY, 1/LT JOHN D LANGIE, ORGN MAINT OFFICER. FROM THE
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION OF MR. I AM SURE THAT HE OBSERVED
SOME TYPE OF UNUSUAL PHENOMENA. HE SOUNDED VERY RELIABLE. I CAN
THINK OF NO CAUSE FOR HIS SIGHTING UNLESS IT WAS A METEOR; HOWEVER,
THE WEATHER AS REPORTED TO ME BY THE DET 2 EATHER SECTION FOR CRESCENT
CITY WAS NO WIND, NO CEILING, VISIBILITY 15 MILES, AND SINCE IT WAS
1740 AND DUSK THIS SEEMS TO BE A GUESS AT MOST SINCE I THINK A

PAGE THREE RJW ZKP3 33
METEOR WOULD BE EASILY IDENTIFIED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. SINCE TWO
PEOPLE OBSERVED THIS OBJECT, IT IS LIKELY THAT A UFO WAS SIGHTED AT
1740 AT CRESCENT CITY, CALIF. PARA L. N/A
