The present report deals with scientific project on
unidentified flying objects with particular attention to
sightings of UFO's.

A sighting in Morgantown, West Virginia on the night
of 16 Jan 62 by two high school teachers, Mr. Petry, who
was driving, and Mr. [illegible name] who was in the passenger
seat of a vehicle, was reported to the Wright-Patterson
AFB weekend duty officer. The two teachers were driving
"when all of a sudden" they saw a "bright light" moving at
the end of a hill. They were approximately at the end of their
work at the other end of the marker. I both the identical
descriptions of the objects.

Here is the text from the document:

they were circular, dark green at the center and became lighter green toward the edges. There was a yellow glow around the objects that had a sign off affect that indicated the objects were turning at a high rate of speed. The objects were moving at a tremendous rate of speed and in a formation. Following is a diagram of the formation.

I now work as a computer programmer for the Navy Department in Washington, D.C. Please let me know what you think of what I saw.
