Dear sir:
I waited to respond to your letter until I could give you some additional information which I have just received. The object was sighted on September 3, 1962 at about 10:00 p.m.
The object was a long cylindrical shape, apparently hovering about 200 feet above the ground. It remained stationary for about 45 seconds, then it began to rise slowly, tilting as it went. It then made a 90 degree turn and shot off at a high rate of speed, disappearing in a few seconds.
This report was called in to the nearest Air Force Base, and they verified the report. The base said they had no aircraft operating in the area at that time.
I hope this additional information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please let me know.
