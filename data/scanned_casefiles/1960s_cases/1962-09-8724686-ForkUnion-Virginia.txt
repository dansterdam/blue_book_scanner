21 Sep 62

Fork Union Military Academy
Fork Union, Virginia
September 3, 1962

Dear Sir:

I wish to report a sighting of a flying object and write to approximately 10:30am, Sunday, September 2, 1962, I sighted the UFO for a few minutes. The object was not with a stationary or large type and was fairly well sighted in the bottom. The object was traveling the sky and then slowed down. It was in investigation mode, it was a flying object a few minutes. This object was moving of a size(?) possibly somewhat rapidly. I would say it was 20th the size of a normal plane, etc. It could have been a satellite, plane, etc. I could stop in mid-air.

I will say to you I flying saucer not to send toward the idea.

This is NO HOAX!
