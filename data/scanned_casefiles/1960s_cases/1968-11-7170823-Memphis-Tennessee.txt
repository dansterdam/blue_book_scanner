AFR 80-17(C1)

On Monday November 20,
1968 I went on a
field trip with my science
class to the Memphis Municipal
Airport. It saw how the
radar worked. It seem as if
they would have picked it
up on their radar and beside
that, the Naval Air Station
said they picked up nothing.
You ought to check with them
also.
