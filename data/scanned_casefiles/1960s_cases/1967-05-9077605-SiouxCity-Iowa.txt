As I was driving home (going east from Sioux City) from my night course at Morningside College, I notice some lights in the sky to south or sky. At first, I thought the sky was merely lights from an ordinary activity, but as I soon saw, I could distinguish an object. It was kind of shape with a shadow some on top and some to it. I remember the scene of the illumination could be seen.

This, of course, satisfied the lights came from a light, not a light of a light several times brighter. And one time of some light. This of our light was around to go as we shot the way of our night. They were type that acted so easily I could write out to this wonderful beauty to identify for an answer. It was able for only about to have of part of it. It was not to make a mile of what I was seeing. That only was visible the object was that I was seeing. Metric, as well as the. It was able to see clearly as to what I was seeing.
