10. COMMENTS
Balloon sighting characteristics
present. Flight should have been
into w/analysis as balloon is
that obj disappeared in same general area. Flight erratic &
including hovering. Possible leak
causing smoke or vapor impression
near obj. Disappearance given
as hazy out. Sufficient data
for analysis as balloon. A/C
viewed obj 15 mins after ground
rpt received.

11. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING
"Diamond shaped like star, creamy white,
viewed for 25 mins. Obj was very bright
compared to background stars & had a
stream of light or vapor coming from
of obj & extending 1/2 to 3/4 of its
length. Also had a rotating beacon like
obj, around the bottom. Erratic flight
including hovering. Initial observation at 200 dgr AZ 30-45 dgr elevation. Disappearance at approximate same area. Obj observed
a/c in area. Gave impression of being
strobe or light. Estimated speed much
two (2) in error since obj apparently
stationary."
