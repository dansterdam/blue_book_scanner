TEXT OUTPUT:

MIAMI FLORIDA - 3 MARCH 1962

The witness, a resident of Miami, Florida, reported that on 3 March 1962 at approx. 8:15 PM while outside his home, he observed a bright object in the night sky to the northwest which he described as about the size of a silver dollar when held at arm's length. The object was stationary for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. His initial observation lasted about 5 minutes.

The witness stated that the object was a brilliant white light, round in shape, and seemed to have a bluish tint around the periphery. He said it appeared to be saucer-shaped and the light did not vary in intensity during the observation. The witness reported that the night was clear with unlimited visibility. No sound was heard during the sighting.

The case was investigated by a NICAP investigator, who found the witness to be reliable and sincere in his report. The investigator stated that the witness appeared quite puzzled by what he had observed and that he could not offer any conventional explanation for the phenomenon.
