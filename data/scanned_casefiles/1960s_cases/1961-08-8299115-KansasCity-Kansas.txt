10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Circular in shape. 1/2 football field size. Lighted area deep. Lights whitish yellow. Too nervous to notice color of obj. Looked like sled with running boards. Substance and body depth unknown. Saw what type of material. High tail. Size not known but vertical running fin center to end.

11. COMMENTS Classed Unknown. Description of obj would indicate possible balloon except for altitude of 50' off ground and sudden rising. Completeness of description and details given by 2 observers gives little info upon which to ex- ify obj into known categories and explain sighting.

No sound. In car stopped beneath obj. Could not see thru cloud see around. 1st sighted 3 blocks away. Estimated 50' off grounds.

Stationary 3-5 min then moved straight up and to E, rising and disappearing in 5 sec. No weather inversions. No wind. No clouds. Weather clear and dry.
