Two young observers were going to Scout's and while on their way through the woods when they noticed a bright object. They first thought it was a rocket but stopped and thought rockets are not fired down range to the south. Then they figured it was a balloon painted with fluorescent paint. As they went on the object got brighter, it got so bright they couldn't look at it. They went walking around where they thought it was hovering, and found it on the ground. As soon as they got close enough to see what it was, it blew up.

Dear Al,

Your letter explaining what you saw is very sketchy and impossible to explain because too many details are missing. Please fill out the attached form and return it to us for evaluation.

Also attached are the Project Blue Book Brochure, Dr. Carl Sagan's paper on UFOs, and a few summaries of cases which have been reported to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir's,

I am m-typing this letter to you because I am a believer in U.F.O.'s. So this is the story of when a friend of mine and I saw what we believe is not swamp gases, balloon's, or anything like that. My friend and I were going to Scout's on March 23, 1966. We have to walk through the wood's to get there. So, we were going along when we saw a bright object. We thought it was a rocket, so we stopped to watch it.

In our town, we can see rockets go off. A downrange rocket can be bright, so we didn't think it was a flying saucer. Then I stopped to think, rocket's aren't seen taking of from the south! I told my friend. He agreed. We thought it was a balloon painted with fluorescent paint. So we went on, then it got brighter. We stopped again.

Then it got so bright, we couldn't look at it. So then we got to wondering. No balloon does this! So it went out like when you turn out a light. So we went walking around where we thought it was hovering. Sure enough, it was on the ground. As soon as we got close enough to see what it was, it blew up! So we hauled buggy out of there. We told my brother who was in St. Louis.

He is in the Air Force. We told him when he called home one night. He didn't believe me. So far he is the only one, except my sister, & 2 cousins who I told. So the next day, my friend and I did a little investigating. We called Vero Beaches airport. We asked them if they sent any balloons up the past 2 weeks. They said NO. Then we called Pal m Beach airport. They

They also said no. So we called Miami. Same thing. So it wasn't went on that we couldn't find any clues as to what it was. So that is why I am writing this letter. Maybe you could tell us what it was? If you send me information on U.F.O.'s that acted like this, I would appreciate it.

Thank You,

My address is: [redacted]

Thank You, [additional redacted text]
