UFO SIGHTINGS

HQ USAF SAFOVIC (Mrs. Hunt)

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified objects from Mr. [redacted]. The analysis section at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has evaluated these reports as (1) aircraft, (2) meteor, (3,4,5) aircraft. No data was presented to indicate that the Air Force could not attribute the sightings to normal aircraft flights. The duration, motion of the objects, and in particular the light described in Report #5 is consistent with United States military and civilian aircraft equipped with a red rotating beacon which could give the visual characteristics as described in paragraph 1/2 of Report #5.

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain the present Air Force position on unidentified flying objects.

LAREDO, TEXAS

December 22, 1965

AFSC(FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of UFO's, the first of which I reported by telephone to a Lt. Sutton of the Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, and since he informed me that I would be contacted by Washington, I have continued to make some more observations. Today I called the Laredo Base and was told that Lt. Sutton had been transferred out some time ago, and a Captain Ellis suggested that I write to you direct with my reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is that I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would very much appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of my reports.

Thank you for your attention,

Yours very truly,

Encls.

Report #4.

October 10, 1965, 7:15 PM

UFO came in from about 340 degrees, no sound, two unblinking lights, about the span of a jet wing. Might have seemed to be great with no aura cast, and left light off white, also no blinking.

There was no body or fuselage discernible. Speed about 600 mph, made a slight turn to South East along 135 degrees heading, and then one light seemed to turn off, leaving the whitish light alone.

At this point (AF Res) stopped out of his car. I had thought all along that he already had come out. My son and I watched until it got lost in the distance. Other witnesses were my wife and son. We did not see it until it had turned whitish more off, and watched until it got lost in the distance.

Report #4.
