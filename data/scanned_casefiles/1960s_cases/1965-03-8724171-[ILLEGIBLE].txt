Unfortunately, this case still remains unknown. Although I feel any further investigation is hopeless, I would suggest that wind direction for this night be established, if from the southwest, it could possibly have been a balloon with a scientific payload, but this seems unlikely.

End of report.

When I came out of barn I noticed these red lights in a distant pattern just past overhead my son 16 yrs old was with me. We were both stunned at first to see these lights so close to the house. He started to run toward the house. It so appeared was very slow because I considered calling him back in case it should hit the house. He continued on went into the house and called his older brother who came out and joined us.

It continued on in a straight line toward a ring of hills about 2 mi away my oldest son explained it would crack into the hills. It somehow managed to make it and disappear over the horizon.

MT. AIRY, MARYLAND
8 MARCH 1965

At approximately 1940 EST and observer and his son came out of a barn and noticed six red lights estimated to be about 1200 feet. From the observer moving at a speed of about twenty miles per hour, toward the NE. The lights appeared as three pair of lights, actually like the tail fins of a 1958 Ford. All of the lights had the same intensity and was comparable to a traffic signal. Another witness was summoned from the house and then all three observers viewed the lights. One witness stated that it looked like a flying wing. It was a very dark night and there were no stars out. The flight was in a straight line toward the hills, two miles away. All of the observers thought the objects were going to crash into the hills but it went over instead and disappeared over the horizon. The lights passed between the barn and the house at an altitude of 100 - 500 ft., and was in view for a total duration of three minutes. To simulate the sighting, one witness would take a dirigible or blimp oriented sideways and place three pairs of red lights along it.

COMMENTS

The outstanding factors in this sighting are the very slow speed, the floating sensation, and the extreme closeness, yet lack of sound reported. A portion of the available data is characteristic of a balloon with a scientific payload or some type of large glider. Attempts were made to put either of the two in the area to no avail. The wind was out of the northwest, which also conflicts with an evaluation of a balloon. With the existing data the case is listed as unidentified by the Air Force.

K. POSITION, TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
Report prepared by Captain Anthony L. Giuliano, AO 3009325, B-47,
Navigator, awaiting PCS move. Preparing Officers comments are as follows:

Miss[REDACTED] and Miss[REDACTED] both gave me the impression of being typical teenagers, shy, fairly intelligent, and sincere in their beliefs as to what they actually saw. They agreed in general, at all times, on answers to all questions put to them. The girls were not questioned separately since they had been checked by [REDACTED] before, immediately following the sighting. This will be covered more fully in a narrative covering additional and supplemental information given by Mrs. [REDACTED]

A thorough check of the area of sighting by the investigating officer reveals no additional information. Particular emphasis was placed on search for foreign stone or ore, hunks of metal, burned spots or areas, and general disorder among the trees and bushes. The emergence of growth in the area made possible a thorough search, but with negative results.

Before covering information received from Mrs. [REDACTED], a description of the area behind the Crabtree house is needed in order to better understand and evaluate the facts.

The land behind the Crabtree house is level for about ten yards, forming a natural yard. The next hundred yards raises at a slow gradual rate and is sparsely covered by grass and weeds. After that the ground rises at a more rapid rate forming a hill roughly two (2) hundred yards from the house.


- page 24 -

The hill is covered much like the other ground, with the addition of scattered bushes and trees. Fact the hill is typically Ohio rolling terrain with scattered farms.

Following is information given by [REDACTED] Introduction is made of a ground sighting by [REDACTED] which may or may not be connected with the original sighting, but is submitted because of the short time span between the two sightings.

On the night of the sighting, [REDACTED] tried to awaken her Mother to see the object. Her first attempt met with little success. The second attempt proved to be successful but by then the object had disappeared. Now fully awake, [REDACTED] recalled hearing about an UFO sighting on the Huntington and Charleston News Broadcast two days before. To erase any doubts she had about the sighting [REDACTED] separated a girl friend who was spending the night with [REDACTED] and instructed both girls to draw a picture and describe what they had seen. The similarity of pictures and descriptions given by the girls, convinced [REDACTED] that they had indeed seen something unusual. At this point she was content to pass it off as something that just happened.

On Tuesday evening, 23 March 55, the entire [REDACTED] family was at home watching television. Intermittently throughout the evening, reception was interrupted by a series of unequally spaced beeping sounds. Conversation between [REDACTED] and neighbors the next morning, revealed the interference was heard throughout the neighborhood. Conversation between the reporting officer and a neighbor confirmed this, although the neighbor restrained from giving her name, "so as not to get involved", as she put it. The weather at the time of the interference was heavy, with light rain.

The next incident occurred on Wednesday evening 24 March 55. Once again it was a dark, misty night with moderate rain. During a trip to the


- page 25 -

Kitchen silence out the window revealed a sort of pole, sticking out of the ground in a place where are no poles. A light in the back yard was turned on but did not illuminate the pole any better. (See drawing, attachment A for position of houses, yard light, and movement pole). The "pole" disappeared.

Later that evening Debbie called from the bathroom that there was some kind of pole sticking up from the rear corner of the house next door. At first she thought it was the neighbors TV antenna, but a closer look showed the pole to be not on the corner of the house but out beyond the corner at approximately the same position she had seen it earlier.

At this time she got a flashlight and went to the rear porch, and played the beam up and down the pole. It looked like a large automobile antenna, chromalite, about thirty feet tall. It appeared to have no base, and was topped by a small, gold colored ball. She then went to call her husband. Then the pole had disappeared.

It was at this time the decided to let-and-rite of their experience.

The incidents of the television interference and the pole appearance could possibly have been caused by some sort of weather phenomenon and were included in this report only because of the short span of time during which all these incidents occurred.

Mr. was not available for comment on his proposed sighting on 25 March 55. (See basic letter). This too could possibly have been caused by some sort of weather phenomenon.

Mr. confirmed that he, and two neighbors, thoroughly searched the area where the "pole" appeared, with negative results.

No unusual sightings have been seen in that area since that time.

March 25, 1965

Dear Sirs:-

With regard to your request for information on U F O I wish to report the following sighting.

Time : March 16, 1965 10:21 appx.
Direction of travel North North East

On the evening of the above date I along with my son was leaving a class at the Technical College in the city of Halifax, Province of Nova Scotia, and my attention was drawn to what appeared to be something like a group of jets in close packed formation, like that was seen aerial displays are put on for the Public.

After watching for 3 seconds the absence of sound, and the appear-ence of what appeared to be some sort of jet thrust back further from the what had first appeared to be jets I concluded that this sou nd not to be so, as the rate of speed was sufficient to allow the sound to return to my place of vision.

Then the appearance of a bright whitish light in front end above the three lights(see diagram) that I had not previously noticed came to my attention, this kept the same rate of speed as the 3 distinct lights below and in back, and what appeared to be some sort of violet bluish flame (like that of a acetylene torch) was seen to be emitting some sort of power like the thrust of a motor, the arch of vision was approximately 70-80 degrees, and then the lights disappeared behind some clouds.

My conclusion is that if this was a vehicle of some sort it was of size of perhaps 1000-1500 m length as it appeared to be a. the height of 50- 75,000 ft, and for the spacing of the light it was like 3 some points of port holes or observation areas the rate of speed was not that great that it could not have been some type of large jet plane but of enormous size. I can only conclude that my report to the RCAF in Canada confirms that such a craft would appear of wider, and that no craft was reported to their attention, and that they reported that they had other reports of the same sightings made me feel that we have either had a visit by craft from these unknown, or that our first sighted was on course that airforce officials do not care to make available to the public.

I trust that my account of the sighting will help correlate other reported so that some answer to the appearance of this unexplained craft can be found.

I have been at the Cape Kennedy operation while on vacation and have witnessed some launchings of the Gemini Titan 2, and ranger missiles as well, as other during the letter part of January, and up till and including February 16,1965 my observations of these launches confirmed my opinion that these were no missiles as the speed was too slow, and the height too low. Your comments will be appreciated at your convenience.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]:

We have received your letter dated March 29, 1965, and from your account of the event on March 16, 1965, it appears that you witnessed a total orbital decay and reentry of a Soviet scientific satellite. COSMOS 57, launched by the U.S.S.R. on February 22, 1965, is known to have been in orbit. Into over 100 significant pieces of which seven decayed from orbit, reentered the earth's atmosphere, and burned up on March 16, 1965.

Your altitude estimate of 50-75,000 feet-this is the altitude range where decaying orbital total objects become luminous from the friction created upon entering the atmosphere.

Your interest in this matter as well as your excellent report are greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir;

at 12:40 A.M. on March 26
I spotted a flying object going
North from Juno Strader at a
moderate speed and then making
a sharp turn west. It look like
a fish with head about the size
of a soft ball and a two foot tail.
It was not a ball of fire and
it was in my view for about
twenty seconds. This object was
not as high as the stars and was
a controlled flight. It was not a
plane because of the sharp turn
this object took from North to West.

Sincerely,

[Note: The signature and some other details are blacked out]

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

May 26, 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Box 9494
FTD Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I would like to report on my telephonic investigation of the Mt. Airy, Maryland, case of March 8, 1965. I had a long telephone conversation with the father and with the sons in the background. Father sounded steady and reliable, puzzled, but unexcitable. I can't pick any holes in the reliability of the report. There were two twists, followed by the third. The seventeen-year-old son was with the father when it happened and they had time to call to the twenty-eight-year-old son to come out of the house and take a look. "There is some possibility that the event might be tied in with Camp David which is about twenty miles away in the same general direction the lights were observed going. The lights also paralleled Rt. 40, which is about a quarter of a mile away and which has a lot of traffic on it.

Mr. [REDACTED] is an instrument maker at the Bureau of Standards, but also operates a farm.

The outstanding things in his mind were the very slow speed (as if attached to a balloon), the floating sensation, and the extreme close-ness yet lack of sound. "I would take a dirigible or blimp oriented sideways and place three pairs of red lights along it - a pair of lights like the tailfins on a 1958 Ford. He said it looked like a flying wing. All lights had the same intensity.

Mr. [REDACTED] felt, "It was just something I couldn't understand." Lights were diffused but bright. It was windy, but he doesn't know the direction of the wind. I checked him on the length of time, but neither he nor his sons would shorten it. I checked him about his recollection since that time, and he says he is still very puzzled and has been riddled about it quite a bit. And, someone gave him a book on air craft. I confirmed that the object came directly over their heads and that it gave the appearance that it was about to crash into the house. He saw no fusilage whatever, but lights appeared to be attached to something. It was a very dark night.

The whole thing could be explained if we could establish the presence of a large glider headed for Camp David; however, no green or white lights, only red, and speed seems too slow.
