The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. The text in the document is as follows:

1. DATE-TIME GROUP:    18 oct 67   19/01200Z
2. LOCATION:   Oelwein, Iowa
3. WITNESSES:   Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS:   One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION:   15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION:   Ground-Visual (GRV)
7. COURSE:   SW to NE
8. ALTITUDE:   Unknown
9. SPEED:  Unknown
10. CONCLUSION:   1. Probable IATRO (SATURN) 2. Probable AIRCRAFT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer was photographing the moon when he noticed an object in the sky. The object appeared to be the size of the moon through the binoculars. Upon returning outside, the observer noticed the object was now about 30 degrees above the horizon and was moving in a Southwestern to Northeastern direction. The object was directional. When it was directly South of the observer, he noticed lights on the object resembling cabin lights on, or landing lights. At 1920 GMT at 42 deg 36' lat, the moon was at an azimuth of 230 deg 55' and at an altitude of 71 deg 23' at Oelwein, Iowa. During the first part of the sighting, the observed object may have been near the moon. When he returned outside, the object was at a different position.

The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

My former lawyer Congressman stated that as an accountant I should know better than to be taken in by the propaganda put out by self-styled UFO organizations.
He contends the whole issue is a mass delusion, that there is no scientific evidence of the existence of flying saucers or interplanetary spacecraft, and that the many so-called sightings can be explained as natural phenomena or man-made objects.
In view of the nature of my former position, I do not wish to become involved in any controversy over this matter. I can only say that I have an open mind on the subject and am not convinced that the reports of reputable observers can be completely dismissed.

Dear Sirs,

On Oct. 2, 1967, at approximately 10:00 p.m. I was standing in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn in Oelwein, Iowa and observed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering and suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object had red and blue lights and was approximately 200 to 300 feet in diameter. There were no other witnesses that I am aware of. Could you please investigate this matter further and let me know if you have any additional information on similar sightings in this area. 

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The text in the document is as follows:

"The observatory youth forward position as evidence, It would say that there were many reports of so called 'disks' as many other objects about 22-30 feet in size have been reported as almost landing and taking off again. The public being much more keenly aware of the facts mentioned by the military, reports from civilians are being far more detailed and informative. 

These my friends are so far in space, we cannot conceive of the distances involved, we do know of various phenomena related to their space craft or whatever, including the fact of extreme accelerations almost beyond measurable limits.
