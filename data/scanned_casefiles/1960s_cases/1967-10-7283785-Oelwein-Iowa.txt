The observer was photographing the moon when he noticed a large star at the right of the moon. The observer thought that he noticed slight movement so he went inside to get his binoculars. Upon returning outside, the observer noticed that the object was moving slowly in a southerly direction. It continued on this course for several minutes then changed to a NSW direction. When it was directly south of the observer he noticed that it was made up of 4 single lights instead of one.

At 1920 CDT at 42 deg lat. the moon was at an elevation of about 10 deg elevation and an azimuth of 85 deg. Saturn was at an elevation of 16 deg and an azimuth of 98 deg. Stellar Mag of plus 3.0. During the first part of the sighting the observer seemed to have been looking at the planet Saturn. When he may have seen cabin lights on, or landing lights.

To: Major Hector Quintanilla
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office

Sir:

In reference to your letter of Nov. 30, 1967, I would like to know the whereabouts of the object. Surely, one can photograph, like a nearby landscape. However, due to curiosity, I am quite and the bearer hope to see the object, they are in the process of doing so and a complete picture analysis.

As soon as the results of these experiences have been confirmed, regardless of the results, I will gladly turn the negatives over to the PBB here.

Sincerely yours,

[Note: Some parts of the text are slightly difficult to read with absolute certainty, so this is my best interpretation of the text.]

Here is the text from the document:

City on Stone     5-8

Dear Sir:

Enclosed the one original Mysteries
of a UFO that you requested some time
ago. I regret that you are not exactly
the type (for you might nicely see that)
seriously might my curiosity not to be
interested (one or some such). I thought I
would find more explanations and more, but
unfortunately I doubt.

The time on which the object appear
was 8 to 9 p.

If you see, you may note the mysteries, as
they do or do to us now that really
might describe or a few signs. I would
however, might your offer of a point of
the object, describing frame that. It cost a time
and, are not therefore, more or less sure to
have a more arrangement of the object now
and the whole frame. Thank you for your kindness.

Sincerely yours,

Note: There are some black redaction marks at the top and bottom of the document.

The image appears to be a very low-quality, grayscale scanned document with significant noise and graininess. However, I cannot discern any legible text on this page. The entire document appears to be extremely faded or poorly scanned, making the text unreadable.

I apologize, but I cannot discern any legible text on this page. The image appears to be a very low contrast, grainy black and white document with several small white holes or tears, but no readable text is visible.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a very faint, grainy black and white document or photograph with some small irregular shapes or holes, but the details are extremely difficult to discern due to the poor image quality.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

OELWEIN, IOWA

Major Quintanilla,
USAF, Aerial Phenomena Office

Sir:

In reference to your site two questions or your enclosed letter: The second object was no covered on one of the photos, but went unknown while shortly before my last letter to you. These were shots taken at random just minutes after 2 most (illegible word) of the west object was between the three towers, (approximately speaking) to the west. This would be almost to the same area where the west object could have "stopped" at parked its present course. These pictures would have been taken about contact with the waverly rep drive. I do not correct necessarily letter as after description of the first object:

In answer to your third question, I only tell one our report she had that was one object to tell, only as remained stationary for 15 minutes. Parked mostly. I don't know how long it was there before I really took notice of it.

[Bottom of page contains some partially illegible text/numbers]

To answering your second question on elevation,

I would say that were were about 30° yds or miles.
The moon was full or almost full when was the
reason of taking pictures on the high place. The moon
has been seen roughly about 4 - 5/4 as an hour.
Between roughly was:

After my first shot, two letters, we located at the
negatives and tests under micro scopes on the micro-
copy 400, at upper Iowa college. Here are the
details of our sighting, seen are close to actual
size.

Note: Copies to be named the
negative only as a
large star at all times.

I apologize, but while I can see the document, much of the text appears to be written in a way that makes it difficult to perform accurate OCR. Some words are legible, but most of the text is hard to read clearly. There is a large black redacted section at the top of the document, and the handwritten text below is somewhat blurry and at an angle that makes precise text extraction challenging. I can make out fragments of words, but cannot confidently reproduce the full text without risking introducing errors.


- page 42 -

Unusual, we a story, or way good point
was any before? Came with all through
about then. I was also glad to see object
saw 5 a.m. ago. The military reported for
moving? Was military inform you
is well say any thing 6 from conclusion
could be next

Note: Some words are partially illegible or difficult to read with complete certainty due to the handwritten nature of the text. The transcription above represents my best interpretation of the visible text.
