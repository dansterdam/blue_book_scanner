Dear Sir:

On the night of Sept 23, Sunday at 10:03 PM C.S.T. I was driving south from Vernon, Texas on Highway 183 and I was approx. just east of Lake Kampa and I saw either a rocket or meteor fall in the east sky. It appeared to be ten to fifteen miles from the brightest star in the eastern sky which I assume is Mars.

This falling object was a whitish-white light which was 5 or 6 times longer than the about rectangular star. Its path was seen from just above the line to about 1/2 to 1/2 the way down to the

Dear Mr.

This is in response to your letter of September 23rd in which you reported sighting unusual aerial phenomena on September 22nd in the Lake Kemp district.

What you saw was, in all probability, a meteor. Although satellite decay characteristics are essentially the same as those of a meteor, with three exceptions, there was no satellite decay reported for the time specified in your letter. The exceptions in characteristics mentioned above are (1) the satellite decay is of longer duration, up to as much as 4 minutes, (2) the direction of a country is to the northeast or southeast, and (3) colors associated with the breaking up usually tend toward reds and oranges.

We want to express our gratitude for your report to us. Observations of this nature are of particular value in attempting to identify and/or locate satellite decays.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
