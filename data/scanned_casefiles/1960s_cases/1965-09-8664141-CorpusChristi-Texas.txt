[Headline] Jonestown RD Families Describe Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted

Flying saucers, hovering at low levels, again appeared in northern Lebanon County and were sighted by at least two families in the Jonestown RD area Sunday evening.

Mr. and Mrs. Giles Brown reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object hovering about 50 feet from their trailer home at 11 p.m. The children of Mr. and Mrs. George Young sighted a similar object in the vicinity of their home at about 10:30 the same night.

[Continued Article Text]
The two families live about two miles apart. The Browns live about a mile north of Jonestown and a mile east of Route 72. The Youngs live in the vicinity of the Water Works.

Brown, who believes "flying saucer" prints may have been left by the occupants of the saucer, said the prints were discovered in a newly delivered pile of sand.

According to Brown, the sand, about a half ton, had been delivered to his lot Saturday. He said the prints were found from the pile to mix mortar Saturday. Monday morning, following the sighting, Brown said the sand pile had been disturbed and small foot prints were visible.

Brown said they were alerted to the object's presence when interference disrupted their television picture. At the same time, he said there was a loud roaring.

He and his wife looked out of their living room window and saw the object hovering as they pulled back the curtain about 20 feet above the ground.

There was a ring of lights around the object and a saucer-like shape. Brown said the object was huge, with green lights around the rim and white lights at the edges.

[Sidebar: Mystery Prints]
Small imprints left in the sand of a pile of sand delivered to Giles Brown, Jonestown RD 1, went unnoticed until after an unidentified flying object appeared at the rear of Brown's trailer home Sunday. The prints, both seemingly from right hands, appear to have six digits. Pointing to the prints is Giles Brown. On the other side of the sand pile foot prints like those of a small child also were visible.

[Additional Article Text Continues]
Young, 23, and his brother Ronald, 16, were both driving home in separate cars from Annville at about 10:30 p.m. when they spotted an object "playing over the road."

They kept the object in view until they arrived home. At home, with his parents, sisters, Susan, 15, and Kay, 20, who were watching television along with a friend, Becky Stover, 22, Annville, the three girls also sighted the flying object about in the same area.


- page 42 -

Apparently there was no interference noted on the television set at the Young home. Ronald reported sighting the object "coming out of the woods" and "rising into the air."

At home, the family said, "It came out of the woods in back of the home, spun about a few times and returned to a clump of trees, where it disappeared."

The Gail Neighbors, parents, who had gone to bed earlier, were not awakened. They did not call their neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Darby.

This town apparently was in their area. According to Brown, nothing appeared on the farm of J. Waltermeyer, who was interviewed. He saw few or flying objects. Waltermeyer lives in talking with the Waltermeyers/Brown, Brown was interested and thinking.

The family Russell Waltermeyer, who lives about 100 yards from the Browns' residence, William Collins, a neighbor, was also interviewed. It was about a half-mile away at the time, he said.

Mystery still shrouds the usual fog and hand prints on the Brown home. Any traces of not possible those made by human hands. Any traces leading to the object were flying object were not found.

Another UFO Sighting
Sunday's Saucer
Was Blimp; What
Was Last Night's?
Those unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sighted Sunday in the Jonestown area were apparently nothing more than a blimp.

It was learned today that a blimp was flying across Pennsylvania at this time.

However, more sightings were reported last night in the Annville area. So far there is no explanation of the UFOs seen in the area.

The newest "flying saucers" were seen by about 30 persons. Some of them viewed the object through a powerful telescope.

- Glenn A. Powell, Palmyra Rd 1, a night security officer at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation who was on duty Sunday night, told the Lebanon Daily News that he saw the Sunday night sighting were unbelievable.

Officials of the Harrisburg-York State Airport today confirmed that a blimp had been flying over this area Sunday night between 10 and 11 p.m. clinching with the time the UFOs were reported.

The craft, according to the airport officials, had been flying at an altitude of 1,200 feet, en route from Allentown to Akron, Ohio, a course which would have taken it over the Jonestown area.

No blimp or other aircraft was reported in the area last night.

However, airport officials at Middletown, York, and Harrisburg filed reports of unidentified flying objects last night.

Sightings in Annville last night were first noticed by Larry Long, 22, 201 W. Penn Ave., Cleona, and Miss Gail Nicklas, 20, 207 W. Cherry St., Annville.

According to Long, the two were driving in the vicinity of Weavertown Street about 8:30 p.m. when the object appeared. About two miles south, it seemed to be "tipping toward the ground on a field near Hershey."

Long said, "I know a flying saucer is really supposed to look like," and Michael, "but this thing had a white dome on top and another red and green light at the bottom."

Mrs. Richard Schaeffer, 331 W. Queen St., Annville, also described the thing as having a ring of red and white lights flickering occasionally.

When his daughter sighted the object at their home on July 4, Long said he was skeptical. The Daily News and was unaware of the incident until after he arrived home late in the evening.

At that time, Mrs. Wolferd told him about the sighting.

Another Appears

The first object sighted by Long disappeared in the Hershey area. Then, another object appeared in the north and it was similar to the first object.

Wolferd reported: "When I saw the thing, it was just a bright light and wouldn't have a telescope, 30 to 40 millimeters, to see much."

He was certain it wasn't a blimp. "I've seen blimps before and I couldn't mistake this. It looked more like a blimp this thing did when it dived toward the ground and then spurted into the air."

In refuting the Jonestown blimp explanation, Powell said he sighted the blimp from a parking lot on the south side of Memorial Lake in the Gap recreation.

He said it hovered over the Jonestown area about 15 miles in diameter and then headed northwest at about 15 to 20 miles an hour. Little has been learned in the Air Force has not been in many blimp.

Sunday Night Sighting
Giles Brown Jr. and his wife, Lillie, were driving on a road seeing a strange object over about 20 feet off the ground less than 50 yards from their trail- er home Sunday night.

Brown reported that his television set went dead about the same time. He heard a loud noise. He said the thing, however, had about "four or five min- utes" then flew away toward the southeast.

A similar sighting was reported by-incidentally of Mr. and Mrs. George Young, also of the Jonestown area.

In reporting his observ- ation, Brown said the thing he sighted was about two miles from his vantage point. "I could tell it was propeller- driven," he said. "It was sound of the Brown type."

Brown said the object he sighted was home was about 50 feet in diameter with a cup in the top-like bottom and a rim. In relating his account, he said, "All first, I thought it was a blimp."

Brown's wife reported seeing small hand-like footprints at an unknown origin in a sand pile near the side of his trailer home.

The prints, which appeared to have six digits on the hands, were made larger than those of a child about six years old.

Brown, who has been near his home since Saturday, was not aware until Monday when he discovered the prints.

In the Harrisburg air port area, it was reported on the flight plane to in- dicate that a huge, down of hovering over the Jonestown area.

Confirmed, there were no blimps in this area last night.

These are the declarations made by LAN pilot, who together with all the crew members saw a strange flying object in Arica on Monday, September 3.

During this time while tracking the strange object following us, it gave me the impression that when it located us it tried to identify us. At once we requested information from the Flight Control Tower in Arica and Iquique. We were informed that no other flight had been contacted. Then I told them what we were watching.

To pilot DC-68 LAN Flight #904 is Chief of Flight Operations. He has been a LAN pilot for eleven years.

I had no previous experience with strange appearances. I didn't believe in "them". It was not an optical vision due to atmospheric reflections. I am sure it was a mechanical appearance. The plane was flying at an altitude of 8,500 feet, a speed of 500 kms. The night was cloudy and without stars. I was not the only one who saw this strange object, the co-pilot, the engineers, hostess and steward also saw it. It was a light of an intense color, then changed and turned to radiant white. It was suspended at a distance of about 3 kms. from us, in a bright line. It was more or less 2130 hours. Suddenly the same way it appeared, it withdrew at an incredible speed, without leaving any track.

NEAR-COLLISION OF A CHILEAN PLANE WITH A UFO: On the night of September 6th, an airliner of the Chilean National Airline spent ten anxious minutes while a near-colliding brightly-lit UFO performed an incredible series of maneuvers. The pilot, Marcelo Cisterna - one of the most experienced pilots on the line - was the UFO at a distance, at first, and on a collision course. It had a cabin lit up with a light 'similar to a mercury gas light,' and there was a blinding red light coming from its circumference. The plane was five minutes out of Santiago en route to Africa when the incident occurred.

The pilot desperately radioed the control towers at Arica and Iquique, to find out if another plane was supposed to be in the area, but was informed that there was no such plane. The unidentified object soon closed in on the airliner, at extremely high speed, and changed course just in time to pass below it. Then for ten frightening minutes, the saucer paced the plane, flying under, over, and around it. Finally, it went to a higher altitude and disappeared quickly toward the north.

Most of the passengers were asleep at the time, and the crew was seen and described in detail by the pilot and co-pilot, who insisted it was a solid object, definitely under intelligent control. While giving his account at the airport of Los Cerrillos, Cisterna was called urgently to meeting with the directors of the airline, and presumably was asked not to release any further details. (Reuters, September 8th, 1965.)

General Pico, La Pampa, Argentina
6 September 1965

But Argentina - still seems to be the favorite haunt of the mysterious UFOs. A story detailed in Carusi La Pampa, Argentina - dated Sept. 6th describes the weird adventures of a carload of musicians whose vehicle was followed by a flying saucer as they were on their way home from work late one night. It was about five o'clock in the morning when the incident occurred.

The light from the UFO was a blinding intensity, and in the form of a narrow beam, and was said to be brighter than the headlights of a locomotive. It was basically a white light, with overtones of red and green. It was so bright that the pavement was lit up for awhile. Just before the UFO finally left the area at high velocity, whereupon it went to look like a small distant star. Then a little while later it came back and again shone its light fiercely upon the vehicle, which was forced to slow to a stop at one point during the trip.

"It was just like a silver triangle,"
said Stephen.

We understand from the same source that the Amersham Times on the mission

SAUCER LANDING IN BRAZIL: On September 10th, a fascinating incident occurred near a small town in northeastern Brazil. Antonio-Paul Ferro Silva, a field hand, was working in Sao Jose, Pernambuco, when he observed several creatures about three feet tall. They were looking at some tomato plants, while laughing and talking among themselves in a language he could not understand. Above the little men, a flying saucer hung suspended in the air, about 15 feet above the ground, giving off a brilliant light.

Antonio, thoroughly frightened, hid behind a tree and continued watching the visitors, who eventually flew away in their saucers without taking any of the vegetables with them. In describing the saucers, Antonio said that they were larger than the largest tractor. The saucer occupants were dressed in clothing similar to that of earthlings, but their skin had a repugnant look to it.

There being no other evidence to corroborate the incident, the tomatoes are now being examined by technicians to see if they show anything unusual.

Katlea dumps?

The 'invasion' scare received a hefty boost when two shining metal capsules were found half-buried in the ground by a party of ten inhabitants of Huancavelica, Peru (250 km. from Lima, the capital). One was damaged, and the farmers found a thousand of pills of various colours. They also found a kind of soldier's wax-bottle containing a liquid, taken from the Noticias Populares of September 15) containing a fatty liquid. There were also some of a substance which looked like gelatine. One of the men, bolder than his companions, tried some of the pills, and shortly afterwards proclaimed that he felt completely 'full'. In a surprisingly casual way the newspaper account goes on to say that the local authorities were aware that beings 80 cm. in height had landed in the district a few days before, and there was speculation that this was food that had been left for them by UFOs.

SAUCER LANDING IN SOUTH AFRICA. In the first important UFO report to reach us - in recent years - from South Africa, a land of a landing took place on a main highway near the capital city of Pretoria. A policeman named Koos De Klerk, accompanied by another policeman, reported seeing a giant spinning top. As the man approached it, the saucer silently slid off silently at great speed, with flames around its underside. Scientists who examined the spot where the incident occurred, found that a six-foot-wide section of the pavement had been badly burned. Grass on both sides of the highway was also slightly scorched. - This occurred on September 15th.

Triangular UFO Over Valladolid
By Father Antonio Felices

Our contributor is a teacher at the Dominicos College at Valladolid, in Spain.

YESTERDAY, September 16, was for me a most exciting day. At 5 a.m. I was with a UFO which came from the north passed directly over our school. A father and a brother were out in the garden talking, when they noticed the object. They looked at it bewildered. Ten minutes elapsed before they decided to call me. At that time I was in the physics laboratory. They came to call me. I rushed to the garden and looked up, to see it right above the school, the size of a grapefruit, and shining very brightly. I have no idea as to its height, but that was all we could see with the naked eye.

I did was to call out eight other fathers to witness the fact. Then I went into the physics laboratory rather father to get out the 4-inch telescope which we have. By 5:20 p.m. we had the telescope mounted in the garden. When I focused it—well, I just don't know how to describe it. It was a beautiful silver craft rocking over so slightly from side to side. It was like a triangle with an oval body in the centre. I made a water colour sketch of it.

We all took turns to watch it. At 6 p.m. the first stars had begun to appear. The UFO was exactly between the star Aris of the constellation CEPHEUS, and the star epsilon of the constellation DRACO. At 7:03 p.m. the UFO began to lie now more definitely. Many of the fathers who had once laughed at me for believing such things are now themselves now firmly believing in them. What a pity it did not come down for a moment!

Mersea Island, England

The Langenhoe Incident
By Dr. Bernard E. Finch

ON September 14, a very interesting sighting occurred near Mersea Island, Essex. The incident took place at 7:15 p.m. and was witnessed by an intelligent engineer by the name of Paul Green, age 29. He was considerably shaken by his experience but had the sense to record the whole of his encounter.

I interviewed him, and in the presence of two others. Without doubt his story presented an addition he described various subjective symptoms which can only be ascribed to the effects of a very powerful magnetic field on the human body. Apparently the field is so great that it produces a kind of light as yet unknown to our science.

The following is a verbatim report of Paul Green:

"It was about 1 a.m. Sunday, September 14. That I first saw the 'thing'. It was a bright clear night, the moon was up and I could see the stars twinkling overhead. I was returning to my home in West Mersea, having visited my fiancée in Colchester. I had had nothing to drink and was feeling very fit. I was travelling on a motor bike and averaging 40 miles per hour. Just before reaching Langenhoe Hall I heard a high-pitched humming noise over to my left (the east). This noise became louder and I looked up for sign of an approaching aircraft. I could see none but noticed a very bright light which appeared over Brightlings (about 5 miles away). The light was winking and became rapidly larger, and I then realised that I was coming in my direction from over Langenhoe marsh. The light changed from a ball to a cigar shape and changed to a high-pitched buzz. It dawned on me that the light and the sound were connected. The engine of my bike then began to cough and splutter, it mixed several times and then stopped dead and the lights went out. The blue flashing light was now about a mile away to the east. I could make out some sort of an outline and an enormous object span into view, appeared to be a dome on top, inside of which was flashing a strange blue light. The object slowly descended, tilting as it did so and I was able to catch a glimpse of its under-belly. This was rimmed by numerous round objects, the whole resembling a 'ball-race'.

A few paces towards the object, I felt spellbound and was not able to move or speak, just as if I had become paralysed. The flashing blue light became so intense that it was painful, and it appeared to fluctuate in rhythm with my heart beat and hit against my chest. I felt myself tingling all over, rather like the electric shock one gets when handling an electrified cattle fence for too long. The buzzing then became quieter, and..."

spokesman for the C.S.I.R. to comment that it therefore could not have been propelled by conventional motors.

"Long after the object had vanished the tar on the road was still burning. The flames leapt to a height of three feet. Constable Lockem made a sketch of the object as seen by him which strongly suggests the shape of an object commonly associated with flying saucers. 'I have always considered reports of flying saucers as stuff and nonsense, but after this I shall be the first to acknowledge that there is something real,' he said.

"He and his colleague added that they were stupefied and shaken that they could only stare at the object. They saw no sign of life, however, nor did they see any portholes.

"This morning I visited the section of the tar road where the flying saucer of Pretoria had reportedly landed. I must admit that the tar surface was badly scorched. A large black patch, some 6 ft. in diameter, was charred in the road where, according to the two eye witnesses who came across in their police car, the object had stood astride the white line in the middle of the road. The police had blocked off the entire road, according to their report.

"In the patch where the flames coming from beneath this strange object had hit the tar road, the tar surface had completely disintegrated. The white paint of the traffic lines was completely charred, and the tar was so scorched that it was black with two white finger-like fingers. An experienced road worker who had been with the Provincial Administration for many years in their roads department, said this morning that if petrol was poured over a road and set alight it could not cause such extensive damage. He was amazed to learn how badly the road had been charred.

"I was at the scene myself and without any trouble managed to dislodge small stones from the tar. I found this to be the case with most of the gravel in that patch. Scientists from the National Chemical Research Laboratory of the C.S.I.R. took samples of the scorched and charred section of the road for further analysis. The police had summoned their aid in an attempt to try to establish the cause of the burnt patch."

High Level Investigation
Another item stated that: "Lt. Col. J. B. Britz, district Commander of Pretoria North, in whose area the flying saucer had purportedly landed, stated at the time of going to press, that the police considered this occurrence as highly mysterious and that a secret investigation is being conducted from a high level."

Explanations
The above incident was widely reported in our national newspapers, but soon the "explanations" were forthcoming under the headlines like C.S.I.R. says it was not a Flying Saucer and The Saucer story has fallen flat, and Cold water was poured on the story by the Rand Daily Mail (Johannesburg daily newspaper) had this to say the next morning:-

"While hundreds of motorists caused traffic jams around a small burnt patch of tarmac on the Pretoria-Bronkhorstspruit road yesterday, scientists in Pretoria decided South Africa had not been visited by extra-terrestrial beings in a flaming chariot.

"Last night Mr. Douglas Maude, the C.S.I.R.'s public relations officer, said the scientists who investigated the reports had come to the conclusion the most likely explanation was that somebody had inadvertently or purposefully poured petrol or a similar liquid on the road surface. When this ignited it would have produced a fireball which shot upward, leaving a pall of smoke and a circle of burning tar."

The image shows a person bending over near a burnt patch on what appears to be a road or tarmac surface.

Silverton policemen reported they had seen a
flying saucer late off road in the area which they
were patrolling the area shortly after midnight.
Yesterday early a patch of petrol was found and
showed that the road surface where the two police-
men reported seeing the "flying saucer" had been
subjected to great heat.

"Despite the commotion on the national road a
few hundred yards from their homes, residents in
the area were for the most part unruffled by
the reported appearance of the mysterious object.
None of the residents had seen or heard anything
resembling a craft from outer space on Wednesday
night.

"According to an official at the Department of
Civil Aviation in Pretoria, nothing suspicious was
reported from any of the radar stations controlling
air traffic at the major airfields in Johannesburg
and Pretoria areas."

Vital Evidence
The two constables were undoubtedly mad

when they were made out to be liars. On Thursday
night (September 17) they were interviewed on the
radio at 9 am. Constable Lochhead said that they
had omitted to report a fact which they con-
sidered to be of tremendous importance, namely
that their car's engine had stalled when they
came across this object blocking their way. They
had no option but to stop. It was then that
the object suddenly rose from the ground. In a

"I know someone from that district who was
present at the inspection and said that they were
a quantity of petrol put near the site and it
alight. The result was negative - no disintegration
of the foundation was all, and no disturbance was
visible.

"The two police officers swear that what they
reported is the gospel truth and no amount of
questioning can deviate them from their story."

East Rand Fly-Over
Now, by way of a postscript, a final item from Die
Vaderland of September 16, reported by the East
Rand Representative:

Two strange objects were seen over Boksburg
last night (time not specified, but about mid-
sighting). A friend and I were travelling by car at
about 10.15 p.m., when we observed an enormous
white light travelling at a reasonable speed and
which appeared from a north-westerly direction
passing over Boksburg. The object was visible for
several minutes and then seemed to disappear.

At about 12 o'clock last night several people
phoned the East Rand offices of Die Vaderland after
seeing a "red ball" in the sky. According to them
the super travelled from south to north in the
direction of Pretoria. They watched it through
binoculars and could see it distinctly. It was not an
aircraft.

Portsmouth, N H
19 Sept 1961

STARTLING CONTACTEE STORY FROM 1951 RECENTLY REVEALED: Barney and Betty Hill of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, seem like an average, normal couple according to all-report, but their recently-revealed account of a saucer contact back in 1951 is probably the most unusual such story on record.

Near midnight on September 19th, 1961, the Hills were driving through New Hampshire's White Mountains on their way back from a trip to Montreal, when they saw a lighted UFO with a number of windows. Hill stopped the car and walked through a field to get a closer look at the object, which was hovering noticeably about 200 feet in the air. He could see people moving about inside the craft, he says. He panicked and dashed back to the car, whereupon the UFO swung over the vehicle. There was a series of "beeps", causing the car to vibrate, and those soon to have left physical evidence in the form of shiny magnetic spots.

This was the end of the Hills' original report to the Air Force, resulting in an "insufficient data" classification being given to the story. But gradually the Hills realized, after arriving home, that there was a two-hour period, just after the abovementioned experience, which seemed to have been blotted from their minds by a partial amnesia of some sort.

Two years later they started eleven months of sessions with a psychiatrist in Boston who used hypnotic regression to uncover what happened during those two hours. The second encounter occurred with the same UFO. This second encounter was down the highway from the first, and only a few minutes later. The Hills gradually remembered that the spacecraft had landed in a field near their car and its occupants had surrounded them, and had taken them out of the car and into their craft.

They were examined and interrogated about life on Earth by a "leader" who either spoke English or communicated telepathically. Then, they were apparently given a hypnotic suggestion to forget the incident.

The Hills still refuse to discuss the details of what happened aboard the spacecraft, but they have been doing a lot of talking about the rest of their strange experience. If there is any chance of persuading them to come to New York, we intend to get them to lecture for our group, as they have done elsewhere. As in all contact cases, a great deal of skepticism is needed in considering this story, but an open mind is also needed. (Boston Traveler, 10/25/65, 10/26/65; Gloucester, Mass. Daily Times, 10/27/65; Manchester, N.H. Union Leader, 10/26/65, and other sources.)
