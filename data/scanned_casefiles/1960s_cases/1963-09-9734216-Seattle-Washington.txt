Commanding, McCleod AFB
Attn: Public Relations & Information Office
McCleod AFB, Washington

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)
Date: Sept 17, 1963 Between 10 and 10:15 PM Pacific Daylight
Savings Time
Location at time of sighting: Hansville
South, Washington

Description: Object appeared the same color as the stars and the size of one of the larger stars. It held a constant flight aside the stars. My first impression was that two stars were about to collide. However, the visibly moving one passed on by the other without incident.

Course of Object: See attached sketch.
Altitude: Second very high. I heard no sound.
Observation: Visible without aid at the natural eye. First sighted as mentioned in description.
After observing a couple of minutes I glanced away to see if others were still moving object in sight.

I sought out the object again and was amazed to see it, or another object, headed back in almost the same direction from which the object originally observed to be traveling. This time I kept my eyes on this one object for 3 to 5 minutes when it disappeared instantly. I watched for several minutes but it didn't reappear. I saw one falling star during this time after the object disappeared.

Weather: Very clear and cool. No moon. Light ground haze. Capt. Jim Myers with the Boeing Company AFPR office secured the wind velocity from Olympia as being 16 mph at 40,000' altitude 340Â° at 9:00 PM PDT.

Respectfully,

Some illegible handwritten text on the right side of the document, partially obscured.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn diagram of a dome or circular shape with some markings and trajectories drawn inside it.

NOTE: The fellow working directly behind me said that about the same time of the night on Sept 9 1962 he saw within 5 minutes 2 such objects he was sure were satellites. Their paths crossed at about the angle shown in my illustration except both flight paths were to the eastward. The first he watched across to the horizon. The second he watched only briefly. He was camping in the mountains. He hardly observed the first but not the second object.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter dated September 24th in which you reported a sighting on September 17th.

Of the two objects you observed, the first was probably an aircraft. We base this on the duration of flight and calculations. The second object you observed as Echo satellite.

Echo was south of the city of Seattle at a southeasterly direction at elevation of 370 moving in a southwesterly direction at 9:02 p.m. the evening of September 17th.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low contrast, blurry document with text that is almost entirely illegible. While there are vertical and horizontal lines suggesting a structured document (possibly a form or table), I cannot confidently OCR any specific text from this image. The document appears to be a scanned page from a vintage document, but the details are too faint to read accurately.
