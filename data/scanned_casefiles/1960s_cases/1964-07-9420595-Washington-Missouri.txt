Text from the document:

Sgt. Dp DEFENSE
WASHINGTON D.C.

Two flying objects were observed at approximately 2:30 p.m. on July 25, 1964, at approximately 5,000 ft. altitude, while flying in a southerly direction over the Washington, Missouri area. The objects were saucer-shaped, silver in color, and appeared to be approximately 20-30 ft. in diameter. They traveled at a very high rate of speed and disappeared in the distance to the south.

The sighting was observed by Mrs. Linda Jaegers and myself, and we consider the sighting to be authentic and extremely puzzling. The objects traveled at such a high rate of speed and disappeared so quickly that we were unable to obtain any photographs. We were within good viewing range and had an excellent opportunity to observe the objects closely.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram and some text. The diagram shows a horizon line with some angled lines and a compass rose or similar circular symbol. The text below the image asks the reader to imagine the sighting and provide information about how high the object was above the horizon and the direction it was moving.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. First give the estimated height of the object above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please put this figure in the box.
