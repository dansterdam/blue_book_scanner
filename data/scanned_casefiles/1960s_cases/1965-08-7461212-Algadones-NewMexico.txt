1. In accordance with telephone conversation this date, the following information was obtained on alleged U.F.O. The following local law enforcement authorities were contacted: 17,000 diameter, 5,000 bright, 1:05 sighted 17: 50 witnessed.

2. I was unable to confirm any aircraft in the area. however, it appears that the object could possibly be some type of cloud formations. This type of phenomena is unusual and does not seem to be controllable to the extent that one would expect of an actual U.F.O.
