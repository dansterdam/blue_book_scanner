1. In accordance with telephone conversation this date, attached are copies of information received on alleged UFO's. The weather at 2355 local was 7000, scattered 12,000 broken, 50 mile visibility, temperature 64, Dew point 57, winds 230 at 5 knots, altitude 3011.

2. I was unable to confirm any aircraft in the area, however, I feel that the sightings are probably over-flying aircraft in the broken cloud area. This type of sky cover is unusual in this area and there has been heavy UFO publicity that you are quite familiar with.
