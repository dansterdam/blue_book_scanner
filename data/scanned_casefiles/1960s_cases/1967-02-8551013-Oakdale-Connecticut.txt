of the house and then back to the middle of the block.
It turned red - then white - then red. It seemed to
dim to nothing; and then came back real bright red and
white. Then it went down out of my sight.

February 18th at 6:10 p.m. I saw this light go same
way exactly as on the 16th.

March 6th at 8:00 p.m. It was much bigger and
brighter and went back to the same point as other
2 - then turned red and white and went down.

I am very interested in these and if you request it
I shall continue to send reports.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

I have been seeing, for a period of three months or more this light in the sky at 6:00 o'clock. I saw this every morning that it was clear.

It's usual pattern was as it became light it went up into space and I'd watch this for an hour or so until it was so far up it seemed to blend with the sky.

One morning I set the clock for 5:00 a.m. to see if I could see where and what direction it would come from. Up until now I have not been able to pinpoint its whereabouts.

Thursday - February 2nd: At 5:00 a.m. I looked out the window, it was almost in the same place. I went into the bathroom and turned on the light - I left it on and went back to the window in the other room and it took off 30 ft. By 5:12 it was so far up that I could not see it. This frightened me. I watched every night after this and nothing - it was too cloudy.

On the 12th of February at 5:00 a.m. I again saw this light and this time it did not seem to be as high as before and as soon as I looked at it for about 5 minutes or so it went up a tiny bit and straight even with the earth (North).

Thursday evening February 16th at 6:45. While I was eating my dinner I saw this light out my kitchen window and watched it move from my back window to side
