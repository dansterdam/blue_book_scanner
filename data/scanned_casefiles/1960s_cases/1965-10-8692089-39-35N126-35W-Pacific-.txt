REMARKS: AIRCRAFT COMMANDER - IN MY OPINION, THE FLASHES APPEARED TO
BE MADE BY A PHOTO "APPING OR RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT OR SATELLITE.
FIVE FLASHES APPROX 20 SECONDS APART WERE OBSERVED. SPEED WAS
ESTIMATED AT 500+ IF OBJECT WAS AT 40,000. HOWEVER, WE DID NOT
LOCATE OBJECT ON OUR RADAR - AND IF PICTURES OF THE COAST WERE
BEING TAKEN, THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE MUCH HIGHER AND
TRAVELING AT A MUCH GREATER SPEED.
