Dear Sir,

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to
the Air Force.

Sincerely,

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely related to a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:       Day       Month       Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The first object and second were oblong in shape. The first one seemed to be burning at its edge and had a yellowish-orange glow. The second one was about the same size but not as bright. They passed in the southern most part of travel at about a 30 to 40 degree angle. Both object moved at a terrific speed, faster than any jet I have seen. They appeared to be about 4 to 5 miles away and not more than 1000 feet high. The second object was slightly higher than the first. They disappeared very rapidly in the southern horizon. I got a very good look at both objects and they appeared to be solid and not just lights. I do not believe this was any type of aircraft I am familiar with.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely part of Project Blue Book. The image shows a form with questions about whether the witness has seen the object before, if anyone else was with them, personal information about the witness, and when and to whom they reported the sighting.

- page 10 -

There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and answer fields for the observer.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes - No - Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or other trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
