2in high school. My senior theme - war unidentified flying objects. so, I know about them - and people clearing & see this bull crap. and that bull crap! - But I know not to what I saw. Maybe flight the angle of a high stern view. Missing was no motion! object I was sure. Trail whatever. Actually, no motion! So I was sure from his explained!!

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
[Handwritten response appears to be partially illegible, but includes date of Aug 3, 1965]

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   6   Sept   1965
                                                   Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Just to sum up:

This small dot moved across the thing on sun about 12 seconds at approx. a 75Â° angle so you know that a small object either moving totally across the sun in 12 seconds is pretty fast!!! That's all I saw. The reason - I was looking up into the sky in because at this time there was a surge of reports of U.F.O.'s in our city, and this interested me - because I had made such a detailed report in High School and Class in College!

Thank you so much for letting me bend your ear!

I hope this can be solved! I know there must be an explanation somewhere!!!

Just a sum up.

This small dot moved across the things on clear sky second of apple. a 75Â° angle moving totally across the things in pretty fast!!! That all I saw. This because at the time looking up into the sky is of regrets of U.S. 65 in new city. and this interested me: because I had made such a detailed report in high school and College!

I thank you for what for letting me. I send your card!

I hope this can be so saved! I know there must be an explanation somewhere!!!

Dear Sir:

They desire your in high school
I write my senior theme in English
on U.F.O.'s. In my home town,
recently, there have been reports of
many unidentified flying objects
reports which I believe many
are facts and have no authenticity

I have observed several many
things in the sky in the past year
such as weather balloons, satellites,
reflections, etc. and I reported one
satellite last year to your course
suddenly the light from the satellite
shining was. that it was explained
and all was O.K.

But tonight, August 4, 1965 about
8:30 p.m. I saw something on

DALLAS, TEXAS


- page 18 -

Here is the text from the document:

some of these so called flying
sauces that so many people have
reported!

I saw one! What a laugh! This
air series! Its object was a thin
white - no noise - a straight
line - South - South! you know the
scene! to be mile higher than any
plane I have ever seen. It was
visible, at about a -1 magnitude.
This object moved fairly away across
the horizon in approximately 12 seconds!
faster than a single plane. I have
seen - - to his high up. Then
it faded away because its wings
might come up to see it well.
Maybe this report seems as crazy
as all the rest you receive - But!
- I hope you will write back and
tell me what is probably to be
done! it would appreciate it very
much.

Sincerely,

[The signature is blacked out]

Dear

Reference your unidentified observation of 4 August 1965.
The information in your letter was not sufficient for
evaluation. It is requested that you complete the attached
PUD Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided.

The Air Force appreciates your interest in this subject.

DALLAS, TEXAS
4 AUGUST 1965

Observer was out looking for unidentified flying objects when at approximately 2125 hours a dim red object appeared and was moving due south, straight overhead. The light crossed half of the sky in ten to fifteen seconds. The light, about the size of a bright star, was moving faster than any aircraft the observer had ever observed. The object just disappeared by speeding out of sight. There was no sound or trail noted. The object wasn't bright enough to be seen clearly.

COMMENTS:
The presented data is characteristic of a meteor, however, no trail or tail was reported. As for being a satellite, balloon or aircraft, the duration and degree of arc through which the object passed discounts such an explanation. Observer has reported two other sightings to the Air Force. As such, with the information available, the case is considered as unidentified by the Air Force.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely faint and illegible. While there are some horizontal lines and a border visible, I cannot discern any readable text on this page. The document seems to be a scanned black and white page with very low contrast, making the text completely unreadable.
