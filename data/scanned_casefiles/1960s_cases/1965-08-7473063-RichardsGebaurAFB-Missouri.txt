Report from 3 sub-teen youths of object during UFO "Flap" in area. Data insignificant not worth follow up. Report from Air Force Base with lowest personnel on duty.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
One silver object found in straight level flight observed for 30-40 seconds. Object seen estimated at 220 mph. Flight to NNW. Altitude estimated as 2,000 ft. No sound trail or features noted. Sighting at dusk. Witnesses 2, 12 yr old youth and one 8 yr old youth.

Age of witness, flap of UFO reports from area, and location on Air Force Base with personnel on duty not permitting any unusual activity or objects leads to conclusion that the report should be regarded as part of the "noise associated with the recent flap". Likely the boys were "getting into the act". If an object was observed it was most likely an a/c flight characteristics within a/c capabilities.
