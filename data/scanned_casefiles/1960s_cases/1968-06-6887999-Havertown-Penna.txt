PROJECT 1973 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 15/0200

2. LOCATION: Havertown, Penna. (2 miles west)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: NW - NNE

8. PHOTOS: 0 Yes, XXNo

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: 0 Yes, XXNo

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a red and white blinking light in the sky. He didn't think it was a plane because he felt a plane would have a more definite outline. The observer said that before the object disappeared he saw a burst of fire from the rear.

COMMENTS: The red and white blinking lights certainly sound like an aircraft observation. However, the fire coming from the rear sounded some-what like a hot air balloon. The observer is only 10 years old and isn't sure of the date of observation. For this reason the sighting is being filed as INSUFFICIENT DATA.

THE UFO

One day at about ten P.M. I saw a UFO with my sister.

This UFO looked like a blinking light. It was flying across the sky blinking. Then it suddenly went up in the sky. It then seemed to catch on fire like a burst of fire shooting out of its rear.

Then it seemed to go so fast into the sky that it finally left my vision.

I know this sounds like an optical illusion, but I would like to know if anyone else has seen this strange UFO (or thing). I am only 10, but I do know what I saw. Please answer my baffling letter soon.

Sincerely,
Robert
O'leary

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

[Handwritten response]:
at night. It had the same color lights, like a plane would probably have a more definite outline. It didn't have any wing or tail part, possibly from a slight I could also have been close to a street light, but surely doesn't have red lights to my know[ledge]
