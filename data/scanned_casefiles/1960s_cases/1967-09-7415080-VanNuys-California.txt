UFO Observation, September 21, 1957

Van Nuys, California 91406

1. Reference your letter of September 22, 1967 regarding your observation of September 21. Your sighting was probably caused by missile which was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at approximate time of your observation. Missile contrails can sometimes be seen for extremely long distances. These unusual formations produced by light passing through the vapor trail of the missile are not by a missile blowing up.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

ROSS C. HAWATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems

Dear Sir:

At 7:50 PM on 9 21 an unusual sight was observed in the northwest sky over Los Angeles. 

Very briefly, this was a brilliant white light which seemed to emerge from a green cloud. I will eliminate further details as I presume you will be receiving many other letters regarding this matter.

I would appreciate your opinion or explanation as to the nature of this occurrence.

Truly yours,

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

26 Sept. 1967

Called Vandenburg AFP and asked about the sighting. Sgt. Hayden said that the sighting was almost undoubtedly caused by a mirage which was lauched at 1926 local. He said that the object can be seen for extremely long distances. It is propelled by a pumping through the vapor trail of the missile and not by a malfunction blowing up.
