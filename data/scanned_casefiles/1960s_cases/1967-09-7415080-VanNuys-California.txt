TECH/UFO (Maj Quintanilla)/70916/mhs/29 Sep 67)

UFO Observation, September 21, 1967

Mr. [redacted]
Van Nuys, California 91406

1. Reference your letter of September 22, 1967 regarding your unusual observation of September 21. Your sighting was probably caused by a missile which was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at the approximate time of your observation. Vandenberg Air Force Base officials explained that the Minuteman I missile does not often produce the effect which you observed, but when it does, the effects can be seen for extremely long distances. These unusual formations are produced by light passing through the vapor trail of the missile and not by a missile blowing up.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

JAMES C. MAHATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems

Dear Sir:

At 7:50 PM on 9 21 an unusual sight was observed in the northwest skies over Los Angeles. Very briefly, this was a brilliant white light which seemed to explode into a large gaseous blue and green cloud. I will eliminate further details as I am sure you will be receiving many other letters regarding this matter.

I would appreciate your opinion or explanation as to the nature of this occurrence.

Truly yours,

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

26 Sept. 1967

Called Vandenburg AFB and asked about the sighting. Sgt. Hayden said that the sighting was almost undoubtedly caused by a minuteman I which was launched at 1928 local. He said that the missile does not often produce this effect but when it does it can be seen for extremely long distances. It is produced by light passing through the vapor trail of the missile and not by a missile blowing up.
