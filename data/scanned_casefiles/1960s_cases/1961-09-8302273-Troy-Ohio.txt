The object was both sighted in the NE, NE sky area. It was not this moving object, but the object was reported that in itself did not appear that we could remain with the object. The object appeared as a white glow at first, then white passing to the NE the object appeared just like the brightest elevation was about 10 degrees. This was about 5 minutes between the first and second sighting.
