THIS IS MY STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE STATEMENT RELEASED BY MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA, USAF, CHIEF, PROJECT BLUE BOOK, CONCERNING MY REPORT OF A SIGHTING UPON HEARING THIS STATEMENT, I MADE CONTACT WITH MR. ROBERT WISEMAN OF CLEVELAND, OHIO, WHO HAS INTERESTED HIMSELF IN RESEARCH CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. I HAVE BEEN FLYING SINCE 1942 BOTH DAY AND NIGHT, AND CURRENTLY OPERATE A SPITTING BUSINESS 2[REDACTED] WITH HANGARS AT HOPKINS AIRPORT IN CLEVELAND, OHIO. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER.

IT IS MY SUPPOSITION THAT MYSELF AND TWO OTHER PILOTS ON THE FIRST DAY AND ONE PILOT ON THE SECOND DAY AT AROUND 11:30 P.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME SAW A STATIONARY OR SLOW-MOVING LIGHT THAT HAD A GLOW EMANATION OR STROBE CHARACTERISTIC OF SOME SORT. IT IS MY OPINION THAT WHAT I ACTUALLY CALLED AND DESCRIBED TO MR. WISEMAN AS PASSENGERS THAT THE OBJECT CALLED 'UFO' WAS ACTUALLY CAUSED BY ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND NOT BY ANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN THE OBJECT REAPPEARED IT FLASHED BRIGHTLY AND APPEARED TO CHANGE DIRECTION AND SPEED, DISAPPEARING TO THE NORTHWEST.

I WILL END MY STATEMENT TO WIT--THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A STAR, PLANET, COMET, OR ANYTHING THAT I DOUBT ANYONE ELSE HAS EVER SEEN, AND I AM AS NO STAR OR ANYTHING WAS IT A REFLECTION.

INVESTIGATORS NARRATIVE REPORT

Subject of this report is the sighting of three unidentified objects in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio, on 8 July 1961.

The primary witness is XXXXXXXXX, an aircraft mechanic with XX years of experience. XXXXXXXXX was on his way to work at approximately 0430 when he observed the objects through the windshield of his automobile. He watched the objects for approximately 3 minutes before they disappeared from view.

XXXXXXXXX described the objects as being circular in shape, with a bright orange color. He estimated the size of the objects to be approximately 20-25 feet in diameter. The objects were observed to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet and were traveling in a straight line at a high rate of speed, estimated to be about 600-700 mph.

XXXXXXXXX stated that there was no noise associated with the objects, and that they did not leave any trail or exhaust. He also indicated that the objects did not appear to have any external markings or structure, and that the orange color appeared to be emitted from the objects themselves.

According to XXXXXXXXX, the objects were sighted over a populated area of Cleveland and were observed by several other witnesses, including a Cleveland Police officer. However, XXXXXXXXX was unable to provide the names or contact information for any of the other witnesses.

XXXXXXXXX reported the sighting to the Cleveland Air Force Base, and was subsequently interviewed by USAF personnel. This report summarizes the findings of the USAF investigation.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
Incident No. 8693605
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object 
Date: 7 July 1961
Location: Cleveland, Ohio
Witness: John Smith

On the evening of 7 July 1961, at approximately 9:15 PM, witness John Smith reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio. According to Mr. Smith, the object was bright, circular in shape, and hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Mr. Smith stated that the object was visible for approximately 3-4 minutes and appeared to be approximately 50-100 feet in diameter. He described the object as having a metallic, reflective surface and emitting no visible exhaust or propulsion. 

An investigation was conducted, but no physical evidence of the object was found. No other witnesses could be located to corroborate Mr. Smith's account.

This incident has been classified as "Unresolved" in Project Blue Book due to the lack of supporting evidence and the inability to identify the reported object.

The image contains a newspaper article with a photograph of a "Mystery Object" sighted near Akron, Ohio. The article describes the experience of an Akron flier who witnessed a bright green light in the sky, which he estimated to be around 2,500 feet away. The article discusses the sighting and provides details about the object's appearance and behavior.

Text OCR:

Akron Flier Tells Of Strange Green Light in Air
Akron, Ohio, July 7.—(AP)—An Akron flier said today he saw a bright green light hovering in the sky near Akron Wednesday night. 
He said it appeared to be about 2,500 feet away and was brighter than a searchlight. The unidentified flier, who was not named in the report, said the light moved south at a rapid rate of speed and then disappeared.
The flier said he was flying his private plane near Akron when he first spotted the mysterious light. He said it appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was hovering about 1,000 feet above the ground. The light, he said, was so bright that it cast a reflection on the ground below.
After watching the light for about 10 to 15 minutes, the flier said it suddenly moved off to the south at a "terrific rate of speed" and then disappeared from sight. There were no other visual or electronic indications of the object, the report said.
The flier said he was a licensed pilot and flight instructor and had been flying for 10 years. He said he was certain the light was not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object. The report was made to officials at the Akron-Canton Airport.
