SUNDAY JULY 9, 1961

THIS IS MY STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE STATEMENT RELEASED BY MAJOR R. FRIEND OF THE UFO PROJECT AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON FIELD.

MY FIRST REACTION UPON HEARING THE STATEMENT MADE BY A MAN WITH A RATHER SKETCHY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS, "WHO ARE THEY TRYING TO KID?" WHY DIDN'T THIS A1R FORCE MAN TAKE THE TIME TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER BEFORE MAKING ANY STATEMENT AT ALL?

HIS SUPPOSITION THAT MYSELF AND TWO OTHER PILOTS ON THE FIRST NITE AND ONE OTHER ON THE SECOND NIGHT SAW A REFRACTION OF THE STAR CAPPELLA WAS STRICTLY A GRABBING FOR A STRAW.

I HAVE BEEN FLYING SINCE 1942 BOTH DAY AND NIGHT AND CURRENTLY OWN AND OPERATE A FLYING BUSINESS THAT REQUIRES ME TO FLY DAY OR NIGHT IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER.

OVER THE YEARS I HAVE SEEN MANY FALLING STARS AND OTHER PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AS WELL. WHAT WAS SAW WAS NOT AN ASTRONOMICAL OR METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA. THE OBJECT WE SAW DEFINITELY WAS NO OPTICAL COLLISTION COURSE TO THE EXTENT THAT I ACTUALLY CALLED OUT TO MY PASSENGERS THAT THE OBJECT WAS GOING TO RAM US. AFTER THE OBJECT CAME AT US IT REVERSED COURSE AND CLIMBED RAPIDLY INTO A CLEAR NIGHT SKY. THIS HAPPENED AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN THE OBJECT FLASHED UP FROM IN FRONT OF US AND AGAIN CLIMBED INTO A CLEAR SKY. IN BOTH INSTANCES, THE COURSE CLIMBED AT TREMENDOUS SPEEDS, LEVELED OFF AND DISAPPEARED TO THE NORTHWEST.

I WILL END MY STATEMENT TO WIT--THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A STAR CLIMB AND MANEUVER AND I DOUBT THAT ANYONE ELSE HAS EITHER. THE OBJECT WE SAW WAS NO STAR NOR WAS IT A REFRACTION.

The text is partially illegible due to the image quality, but I can make out the following:

[Top of document appears to have some text that is mostly illegible]

[Middle of document contains a partially readable paragraph with words like "investigation", "star", "magnitude", but full context is unclear]

At the bottom of the document, there is a clear caption:

"Fig. 4, Amherst, O. Confirmation of green-glowing UFO which former AF bomber-pilot was reporting while diving at his plane."

The document appears to be a page from a UFO investigation report, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing an unidentified flying object sighting.


- page 3 -

Title at top of page: "USAF PILOT HITS UFO 'EXPLANATION'"

The rest of the text is partially legible due to image quality. While I can see there are multiple paragraphs of text, I cannot confidently OCR the full text without potentially introducing errors. The document appears to be a newspaper or official report page discussing a UFO-related incident involving a pilot, but the specific details are not clearly readable in this image.

7-July-1961 THE DAYTON DAILY NEWS

PROBABLY STARLIGHT

Greenish Object Reported
In Akron, Checked by AF

Remember flying saucers?
Well, the Foreign Technologies
division of the Air Technical
Intelligence Center here is
checking out two sightings of
what might be a flying machine.

Investigating officers think
perhaps it was a balloon, conventional aircraft or a flying vehicle.

SAUCER said he sighted the
object at 11:13 p.m. on July
4 while driving between Cleveland and Akron. He made the
sighting the next night about
10:45 p.m.

Mr. Robert Friend, of the
Technologies division at Wright-
Patterson AFB, said the first
sighting was near the first star Capella.

*EVERYTHING in his report
points to this, a sound and
visual sighting of something
moving in the direction, the hour and
everything else.

Friend added that to be
certain this other report is
checked, he would like to get
a complete interaction made to
the ATIC.

SAUCER and both times he
reported a greenish object that
was traveling at a high altitude
high on a collision course with
his plane. He added that it
stopped, moved in the northwest and stopped again before

shooting straight upward and
disappearing.

Saucer, a World War II pilot,
said he could not identify the
object.

AKRON, OHIO - 4 & 5 July 1961 at 10:15 p.m. on July Fourth, between Akron and Cleveland with two planes from Stardust Aviation, Inc., Akron, was flying between Akron and Cleveland with two planes from the same company. When in the general vicinity of about one o'clock high on a collision course with his plane. It stopped, then saw 330 degrees and continued (NNW) and stopped again, before shooting toward and disappearing.

On that night, about the same time, he saw again the preceding object. This time he said it came straight down, then went off to the north-northwest, not speaking the exact movements of the night before.

Major Robert Friend, of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, said he believed that the pilot saw a meteorological refraction of the (first magnitude) star Capella. This theory seems unlikely.

The clipping we have (sent to us by a Cincinnati CUFOR member) doesn't say which newspaper this was from, but it was in Akron, so probably the way it was.

If he was going toward Cleveland, one o'clock would be just about due north. Therefore he has a star coming down first a high elevation to the north, stopping, then moving toward the north-northwest, stopping again, then disappearing upward.

It was a good first magnitude star to perform similarly unlikely antics for a first magnitude star to perform.

EDITING: Just as we were about to close out this issue, we received a good deal of data about the July Fourth sighting (page 3). Among the items of interest: a 17-year-old girl in Mantua, Ohio reported seeing a red-orange object at 10:10 pm, an object was picked up on radar at the Cleveland Hopkins Airport, and some other data.

The record imported this data to us by Mr. [redacted] in which he repudiated the Air Force theory that he saw a star.

Why didn't this Air Force man (Sgt. Friend) take the time to investigate further before taking any statement at all? Why, in this case, did he (his) see a refraction of the star Capella was strictly a gratuitous statement. (Over the years I have seen many falling stars and other astronomical occurrences with atmospheric conditions as well.) With no hard substantive data to support the hypothesis, the object we saw did its act in a collision course to the extent that I actually called out to warn the pilot, saw the object come at us it reversed course and climbed rapidly into a clear night sky.

Information from phone conversation with Mr. JOHN GEIS of Cleveland-Hopkins Airport.

At about 14:30 10, July, 1961 an [redacted], Supervisor of Operations at Cleveland-Hopkins Airport was contacted at CL 2-1774, concerning an object sighted by Mr. [redacted] at the airport. He further stated that he received a call from a newspaper, the Plain Dealer, telling him that a light had been seen over the tower and asked if he knew Mr. [redacted] and to [redacted] in the affirmative. The newsman then asked if the tower has seen anything and he replied that a light was seen, they called the tower and they reported that a light had flashed across the sky. Like a falling star. He was asked if anything has been picked up on radar. He replied that he didn't know, adding that he did not know if it was anything, nor did he receive a report of anything. He further stated that he had talked to Mr. [redacted] the 7th or 8th of July and [redacted] was not mentioned at the time.

Akron 16, Ohio
October 6, 1961

Dear Major Coleman:

I wrote you three months ago in regard to the sighting of July fully over the Akron area by pilots and others. I received your letter, dated 13 July, stating that "This investigation...cannot be concluded until complete data is received - a period of at least three weeks from now."

Would you please send me the conclusion that ATIC has reached concerning this sighting. Also, would you please send me the latest News Release, Fact Sheet, Air Force UFO Report. Thank you.

Yours truly,

[Signature area with some handwritten text that appears partially illegible]

10 October 1961

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

With your letter of October 6th concerning the saucer sighting of
July 1961.

The conclusion in this case is that the [redacted] and others
probably witnessed a characteristic refraction of the star lights during
(locally). About a month ago I was at the same place (Sec. 16, T3N, R7E)
and saw the same thing. At night at 20,000 feet. In the near west I
had a western place (NW) who has alleged several thousand hours of
time of our night conductor with the Air Force of Dayton. We are
waiting over central Ohio. I asked this pilot to look at the object
with me. He said, "I cannot make out what it is." I then asked
into a description of its low the next few minutes. He was somewhat
confused as to natural phenomena. He said, "I cannot explain the
position (present perception) of the star. At about the time I
was confronted with a moving object (its general movement was
-- would disappear and reappear) I told him what I saw. On the
ground later, he was able to draw now shown above the horizon.
I have this information is helpful. The latest sact sheet (case 61)
is enclosed.

Over Two Nights

Akron Flier Sights
Mystery Object

A veteran Akron flyer has reported spotting an unidentified flying object on successive nights over Akron this week.

Ernie Studec, operator of west Akron Tuesday and again Wednesday nights, his aid a former World War II B-24 pilot, described a brilliant green and white object which he saw as he flew over North Cleveland.

Sunday, July 16, 1961

Ernie Is
Sure
He Saw
'Object'

By HELEN WATERHOUSE
Staff Writer, Cleveland Aviation, Inc. described vehemently the "something stars" as some are trying to make out B-24 type UFO's (unidentified flying objects) that he spotted that unidentified flying object the other night.

"I've had hundreds of calls from people who have seen these things," Studec said. "But the worst is the men from the Wright-Patterson Air Force base, so-called Project Blue Book investigators reporting such a phenomenon."

Studec said he was flying Project Blue Book mission the three times that day decided it was the reflection of "something" from the star "X."

Akron Flier Tells of Strange
Bright Green Light in Air

AKRON, O.—Ernie Studec, former of a small fleet of aircraft, is convinced he saw an unidentified flying object on Tuesday and Wednesday nights in the Akron-Cleveland area.

Studec, a commercial bomber pilot, operator of Studec Aviation, Inc., said that while in and two other Akron men were flying, a "brilliant green and white light" appeared in his right.

The light approached them, he said, and then broke off at a fantastic angle and seemed to turn late to a haze.

Studec said he spotted a similar light Wednesday night, flying approximately 4,500 feet, climbing and speed off the same Cleveland-Akron flight level he had seen the light, but could not determine its exact location.

Studec said he had seen this object of greenish light while flying over Cleveland Hopkins Airport Wednesday night, flying at about 4,500 feet.

"At first I thought it was some kind of rocket," he said. "Then I thought it might be a meteor."

"It came at us at a terrific speed," Studec said. "It was at a 150-degree angle and disappeared in a haze in the eastern part of the sky."

Studec, who was flying at a 1,000-foot level and I was afraid of a collision, said he was flying a wing position and he became the way it went over us and was lost to the west.

"It flattened out at about 4,500 feet."

"I would say it came within 1,000 feet of our plane."

Two with Him
With him were Charles Richard Saval, an Akron truck driver, and Charles Shelton, an employee of WAKR.

Studec said he saw the object close but because he couldn't take photographs, he was extremely positive of what he saw.

"It was a very brilliant green," he said. "As near as I can describe it, it was a high-speed jet. But it was green—extremely close."

"It was extremely fast," he added, "but it was further away, he just I know of being that fast."
