PROJECT BLUE BOOK
2. LOCATION: Washington, D.C.
10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer noted circular objects with two distinct lights and rapid speed. The objects appeared to zig-zag and at times in a straight line of flight. Observer reported the sighting to the Air Force.
The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observed at night. The objects were observed out of the corner of the observer's eye. The brief duration of the sighting and the lack of physical evidence precluded a more definitive evaluation.
