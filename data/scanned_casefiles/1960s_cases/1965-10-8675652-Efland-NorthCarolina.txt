There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a document regarding a UFO sighting submitted by Mrs. Hunt in North Carolina. The document describes the details of the UFO sighting, including the position and movements of the object observed, which is referred to as the "STAR CAPSULE". The document is signed by Col. Eric J. Cunningham, Deputy for Technology and Subsystems, on behalf of the Commander.

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Miss Hunt:

I sighted the object on the film last Sunday night (October 31st) at approximately 8:00 p.m. outside my home in Efland, North Carolina. It was in the northwestern section of the sky and moved towards the east. The object was triangular in shape and was illuminated in red color. From land and directly overhead, the object was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately fifty degrees. The object was silent in operation and remained in view for approximately five to ten minutes. There was an appearance of different colors at different times. The object would move to the left or right, move closer or pull away. There were no sound effects. I was able to drive 17 miles to my uncle's home to get my camera and take three photographs. The object was seen on the film while the photographer held the camera still. The photographs were taken at f/8 frames per second, and passed the film in the process as much as possible. We have checked the several other people in this area had also seen the object. It is unknown from the high altitude search centers at Williow Grove, Pennsylvania and other air bases searching for such objects that no such sightings have been made. Last month a photograph of an unidentified flying object appeared in the Oklahoma Journal.
The object had been sighted by many people throughout the southwest and their descriptions matched the description of the object I saw.

Sincerely yours,

The text in the document reads as follows:

Dear Miss Hunt:

It sighted the object on the ttin last Sunday night (October 31st) at approximately 8:30 p.m. outside my home in Efland, North Carolina. It appeared to be slightly larger than a small merchant aircraft about 50 feet in diameter. The object was stationary and was located at an angle between land and directly overhead. The object was illuminated in front and sides with a blue-green color increasing and decreasing in intensity from time to time as the object was slowly rotating. There were no sound or exhaust flame observed. The object would move to the left or right, move closer or move away to the television station at one point. It set up a camera on a tripod and that caught the object on film. I informed the nearest air force bases and several other people in this area had also seen the object. However, I'm not certain that my sighting has been made known to NASA or other proper authorities. Since the object was sighted by many people through the duration of the observation, the description that has been given seems to be perfectly reliable."
