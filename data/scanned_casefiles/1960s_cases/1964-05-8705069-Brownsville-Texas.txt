34. Date you completed this questionnaire:     2     JUNE     1964
                                                Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

A Mrs. Copenhaver called and told me that she thought she saw ECHO II a U.S. weather satellite which is arbitrarily continuously and in view, if clear, about every 1½ hours.

So I watched that night, 5-18-64, and saw a "moving star again, moving from SW to NW this time.

I did not report the latter because I think, now, that what I saw is a common sight.
