AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1 October 1961     21 and 23 September 1961     Office of Air Attache, Helsinki, Finland
                                                Finnish Press

SUMMARY: (Use one line only of report. Give significant facts only in first paragraph. List references on reverse side)

1. Following are translations of two articles which recently appeared in the new Finnish newspaper "Helsingin Sanomat" concerning an object sighted on 23 September 1961:

"At approximately 2032 hours Thursday evening a strange light was seen in Pori for several seconds traveling from northwest to southeast, its appearance was like a ball of fire. The object was reported from a motor and board. It is reported that it could not be seen in air-place." (23 September 1961)

"Professor Yrjö Kaski, one of the Finnish scholars, who was the light phenomenon observer on Thursday night said to the reporter that he saw a bright light moving in the sky. The phenomenon refused to remain at one point. It was ball-shaped with clear tail behind. This was the case with the Pori light phenomenon."

3. Action: Professor Kaski explained that he is a professor of astronomy at the University of Helsinki. He was interviewed by the local newspaper and gave his observations. (Encl) (Interviews were made with other witnesses and their observations noted.)
