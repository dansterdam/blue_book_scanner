The object was like three or four stars together, moving together, and going down from an elevation of 270 degrees. The object did not move rapidly but rather descended slowly. Military personnel observed a similar light in the sky which was on the south for 30 to 45 minutes. The light then moved toward the south for 3 minutes then back to the original position. This light disappeared in about 30 minutes. The observers noted in addition to the UFO but it wasn't. The apparent single object movement by the military personnel could have been.
