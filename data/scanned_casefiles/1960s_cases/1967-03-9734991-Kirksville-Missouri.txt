PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP
6 Mar 67 7/005062

2. LOCATION
Kirksville, Missouri multiple

3. SOURCE
Civilian & Military

10. CONCLUSION
Astro(Venus) ✓
Venus was at 15 deg 31 on an Az of 265 deg

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a bright star like object in the western sky for over an hour. The object was like three or four stars together. The object appeared to be about 45 deg elevation on an azimuth of 270 degrees. The object was nearly stationary but it did appear to move very slowly toward the NW. The object disappeared slowly—just faded out. Military personnel observed a similar light in the sky that was on an azimuth of 270 deg at an elevation of 20 deg. The lights moved at 270 deg for approximately 10 minutes then moved toward the south for 3 minutes then back to the NW direction. This light disappeared in about 30 minutes. Venus was definitely in the western sky and should have been noted in addition to the UFO but it wasn't. One apparent large scale movement by the military personnel could have been noted.

OFFICER FOR THE 790TH RADAR SQUADRON LOCATED AT KIRKSVILLE, AFS, MO.
SAGE AUTOVON 451-4000. COMMENTS: THIS REPORT IS ONE OF SEVERAL THAT
HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THIS LOCAL AREA AND ALL RESPONDENTS SEEM TO BE
RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS. THIS REPORT PLUS THE PREVIOUS ONES HAVE SEEMED
TO DEVELOP A PATTERN WHICH MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE READER. ALL
PAGE 5 RUCIFVG013 UNQ.AS
SIGHTINGS ARE ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME OF THE EVENING WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THE FIRST WHICH WAS SEEN IN THE PRE-DAWN. THE FLIGHT PATH OF THE
OBJECTS SEEM TO BE OF THE SAME GENERAL PATTERN, IN THAT, WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST SIGHTING BY [REDACTED] ALL SIGHTINGS ARE IN
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO FOREST LAKE, LOCATED WEST OF KIRKSVILLE. I HAVE
NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A
PATTERN. THIS PARTICULAR REPORT IS THE FIRST IN WHICH ANY OBJECT WAS
EVER REPORTED, IN ALL OTHER REPORTS FROM THIS STATION OBSERVERS ONLY
SAW LIGHTS. THIS REPORT IS OF SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS INVESTI-
GATOR SINCE I PERSONALLY OBSERVED THIS LIGHT PHENOMENA ON THE SAME
EVENING AND AT THE SAME TIME. I CAN ADD LITTLE TO WHAT MRS. BROWN
OBSERVED, BUT I WILL REPORT MY SIGHTINGS IN PART 2 OF THIS MESSAGE.
