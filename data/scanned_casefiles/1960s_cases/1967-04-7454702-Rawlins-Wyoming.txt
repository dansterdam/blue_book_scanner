The information on this UFO was relayed by CB Radio from Mr. [redacted] (See par E) to Mr. [redacted], a chemist for Sinclair Refining Co at Rawlins, Wyoming. Mr. [redacted] was communicating with another friend in Rawlins by CB radio at the time. He stated that, at the time of the sighting, his radio was "knocked clean off" and that the interference (possibly caused by the UFO) "killed my CB".

Mr. [redacted] was reluctant to give any information since he wanted no publicity.

Upon termination of the phone conversation I called the Cheyenne Airport FAA Tower and asked for any information from them or Denver, Colorado Center which might have been pertinent. There was none. A further check with the FAA on 18 April 1967 revealed nothing.

I believe Mr. Guffy saw a meteor (See a. (9)).
