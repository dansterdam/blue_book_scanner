Dear Mr. Secretary,
On the day of April 13, 1969, the Randall School in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts received a visit from someone visiting us for observation. As he stood near a window in one of the classrooms, he made the following observation about a plane in distress. Almost the whole school saw it and two of the teachers saw it disappear by simply moving out of sight. It happened so quickly none of the children had a chance to see anything unusual.
Yours truly,
[Signature]
Shrewsbury, Boston, Massachusetts 01545
