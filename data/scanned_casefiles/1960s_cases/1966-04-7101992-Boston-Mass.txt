Like landing near on the bottom of 14. It was a vertical white it was about 50 feet up, it was going about 50 miles time about 55 feelings. Smoke was coming out of its side. It made a noise like a plane in distress. Almost the whole school saw it and two of the teachers saw it. It was flying peasantly and 21' of a sudden it disappeared. It apparently was fully and disappeared again. -My name is in Osborn 1 live 1161 Oriole St.
