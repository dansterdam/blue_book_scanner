One Reported

Initial object probably a/c. Stationary object arcturus.
Witness not as alert. Years and Andrews can't fails to note

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
One Hour

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Star moving directly to the West. Velocity appeared so when
slowed than ECHO. Slowed still more after two minutes. Then
several minutes later the object was stationary. The object
remained stationary for 5-7 minutes at which time there was
a series of short light flashes to the South of the object.
These flashes were the same in brilliance as the object and
lasted 2-3 seconds. The entire series was about 5 or 6 times
at 10 second intervals. Watched for an additional 45 minutes
and nothing happened. Later sky was overcast and no stars
visible.

Gentlemen:

Recently I was witness to an occurrence or phenomenon of some sort which baffled me, but may be of interest to you, as a U.F.O.-type observation. This took place in Elgin, Illinois.

On the evening of July 1 at about 10 P.M. while waiting for a friend, I became engaged in a little star gazing. The sky was somewhat hazy but not obstructed by clouds. As a result, at best, only a thousand or so stars were visible. While engaged in this idle business, I happened to detect relative motion between what appeared to be two stars of approximately average brightness. This was about 10:20 P.M. after a few seconds of closer observation it was quite apparent that one was fixed (a star) and the other was moving directly to the west. Its velocity was about the same or perhaps somewhat slower than the echo satellites. I had often observed. Its appearance (size and brightness) was also of the same order and I subsequently assumed I had accidentally spotted an orbiting body. This was a little unusual so I continued to watch it.

After about two minutes or less it seemed to have slowed considerably in velocity. At first I concluded it to be because no stars were nearby with which to judge its rate of progress. As a check I noted the object's path to be at right angles with a much fainter star to the North. After several minutes it was absolutely certain to me that the object was no longer moving, but instead now appeared to be just another star in the sky. Needless to say, I was a bit interested in this and continued to watch. I should like to add at this point that I was not staring fixedly at the object, but rather kept scanning the immediate area to prevent eye strain.

Between 5 - 7 minutes after I had determined its motion to have ceased, there occurred a series of short light flashes just to the South of the object. These were of the same brilliant as the object, lasted 2 or 3 seconds, occurred at about forty second intervals and repeated five or six times before ceasing.

I watched for an additional quarter hour before having to leave. The object remained fixed and still; gave all the appearance of just another star. Later when I attempted to see if any change had occurred, the sky had clouded over and no stars were visible at all.

If you should have received any correlating information on this occurrence, I should appreciate knowing about it.

Sorry this letter was not sent off sooner, but vacation, etc., interfered a bit.
