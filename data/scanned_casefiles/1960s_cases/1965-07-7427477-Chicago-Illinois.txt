k. This particular report was called in to the O'Hare Base Operations Office. The young lady seemed cooperative. She felt that someone might need to know about the object she had seen. She was asked to write a report in her own words. This was requested after attempting to get all the information preserved in AFR 200-2. It is this officer's opinion that the sighting was either a helicopter or aircraft. Approximately where the North Avenue beach is located is also point where several airway are located. The ILS system for Runway 27 at O'Hare would run just north of the North Avenue beach. Many times airliners will put on landing lights out over the lake to distinguish their aircraft because of the heavy traffic. Combine the bright landing lights with a revolving Grimes beacon to explain the touch of red. The landing lights from a distance appear to twinkle because of their candlepower. Enclosed is original of report written by the observer.

Dear Sir:

This is in regard to a phone call I had with a Mr. Jones in your office some time ago. I have forgotten the date now but was asked to write you and confirm what I saw.

On the corner of N. Ridge and W. Peterson ave there is a billboard with the time and temperature. Two talking out on front of one house with several negroes, it was a nice mill night with a nice clear sky at 10:19 P.M.

I saw a large circular object in the sky with orange or amber lights around it. As near as I could make out, the lights were very bright. The lights then went out but one of the little boys caught a glimpse that can't be explained. The light was still on.

This passing over a mile long straight upwards like a helicopter and then up at a angle in a northwesterly direction.

The lady next door to us said she and her daughter saw this object an hour early.

Yours truly

Mrs. Huntman/SAFOICC/72842/7 Sep 65

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your report of serial objects which you could not identify on 25 and 28 July 1965.

Your sightings have been evaluated as probable observations of satellites. The paths of satellites often appear to be erratic with changes in speed and direction. This can be caused by an illusion as one light passes near another or by atmospheric conditions such as haze, smoke, or temperature inversions.

The report from Oxnard Air Force Base on 23 March 1957 was attributed to an observation of stars and lights on a nearby area. This information was released by the Air Force to the Press. The Pasadena Air Filter Center had no connection with the observation.

We have no reports from Clovis, New Mexico, on 2 or 3 November 1957.

The books by Donald Keyhoe are considered by the Air Force to be science fiction.

There are more than 30 satellites and satellite components visible to the naked eye. Frequently the path of these objects appear to be erratic with changes in both speed and direction. This is caused by an illusion as one light passes near another or by atmospheric conditions such as haze, smoke or inversions.

3. The report from Oxnard AFB on 23 March 1957 was investigated by local civilian and military authorities. The multiple objects observed were stars and a searchlight on a nearby barn. This information was released by the Air Force to the press. The Pasadena Air Filter Center had no connection with the observation.

Provisional Officer, U.P.O.
Washington 25, D.C.

Chicago 13, Illinois
July 29, 1965

Sirs:

I would like to report some very peculiar aerial behavior which has occurred over Chicago. On the night of July 25 and 26 very strange objects, seemingly of unconventional design, flew over Chicago. Both objects, according to a confirmed by witnesses as well as by a noted meteorologist.

The sighting on the 25 goes as follows:
At 9:34 p.m. Tuesday, I saw an unusually bright object flying from north to south over Chicago. The observing conditions were excellent, there was no clouds, haze or other obstruction to per-visibility. At first, the object was flying a little faster than a satellite but near slower than a meteor. Both my friend, Jerry Folous, and myself have been amateur astronomers for over two years and we both have seen many meteors and satellites during this time. This object, the description of both satellites and meteor, the object allowed down, brighter and almost like a meteor, and then moved away at the most astounding speed either of us has ever seen. It was first seen near the star Altair by the third member of our party but in less than fifteen seconds had traversed about one-fourth of the sky going in a southerly direction toward the constellation Capricornus. The estimated speed was sixteen to twenty thousand miles per hour. Judging from the speed of its satellites, and about thirty thousand miles per hour when it left us. This, in the first time I had ever seen a U.F.O. so at first I was a little skeptical as to whether or not this was a flying saucer so I did a little research on the subject. In the book Flying Saucers, by George Adamski, I learned that there were perhaps quite similar to our sighting. Here are just a few:

Page 53, March 25, 1957, Midland Air Force Base: A large, round device flashing a brilliant red light was seen the runways, climbed, and maneuvered swiftly over the area. The explanation of balloons was refuted by the Pasadena Air Filter Com.

Page 114, Nov. 2, 1957, 3 p.m., Clovis, N.M. - Navy test pilot, Apparently a UFO was making a close observation of the Navy plane. Though it showed no sign of hostility, it maneuvered around the aircraft, its glow alternately dimming and proving brighter as it climbed and dived.

By this I mean that his statement gave us evidence as to what-

[Note: The bottom of the page appears to be cut off, with the last line incomplete]


- page 20 -

As to the question of our observational capabilities, I submit these statistics:

1.3.- last known as being near 140; vision- 20-22; amateur astronomer for the past 2½ years; has seen meteors, comets, bright planets, satellites, and Milkyway, average and above student.

1.4.- last known to be over 125; vision- 20-20; has been bright planets, stars, network, and satellites, average and above student.

1.4.- last known to be over 125; vision- 20-20; has been an amateur astronomer for 2½ years; has seen bright planets, stars, satellites, meteors, and balloons; above average student.

All of us have seen airplanes and helicopters at night. This object was neither an airplane nor helicopter.

The second sighting took place three days later and was confirmed by six witnesses. The details are as follows:
At 9:55 p.m. C.D.S.T., the six of us saw an unusually bright object in the north. The object was doing fantastic maneuvers. It would travel in a westerly direction, stop, zig-zag, and then resume flying. The object advanced along our vision. The object itself was as bright as the planet Venus which was setting in the west at this time. We were fortunate enough to view this object through my telescope at 140 power. You will find our result on a little piece of paper enclosed. The red colored area actually observed with an increase of speed. We followed the object for about four or five minutes until it was gone.

This time instead of using guesses as to whether this was a UFO, local and national meteorological, aerological, and other area and weather balloons doing tests in the northern Chicagoland area, in answer by saying that there were no balloons testing anywhere near Chicago. He suggested the idea of the object being one of the Echo satellites, but he later retracted this statement then I described the motion.

The other three members of the party are also very capable observers. Outside of the facilities of those above, I could obtain those of only one other.

Like over 125; vision- 20-20; has seen all the objects as stated in the above descriptions.

This case can be compared to the Amarillo case in the sense that in both cases the object was doing fantastic maneuvers. There was an additional factor in the vicinity power. If the pilot had seen anything, he either did not report it or was told not to let it go beyond the airport.

I would now like to show the likeness and differences between these two sightings. Both the first and second object were of unusual brightness. They both glowed. Fantastic maneuvers were performed by the two of them. The first object was characterized by stopping, starting, and moving forward and backward not characteristic of today's conventional aircraft. The direction in which these two objects are opposite; the July 25 object was going south, while the July 28 object was going north.

Both hovered over something. I have concluded that the only thing worth knowing about these objects is their location in the north of either Midway Airport or O'Hare in the south.


- page 21 -

I am very sorry that I could not have had this letter in the mail any sooner. I realise that there will now be great amount of explaining concerning it. I was unaware of the fact that AFR 200-2 requires the prompt reporting of UFOs. In conclusion, I would like to volunteer the services of my friends and myself for further observation of the UFOs and for any more information concerning our sightings. I would like several copies of the USAF Technical Information Sheet concerning UFOs sent to this address:

Both my Principal, Secretary Goodman and myself have been watching meteors and satellites during this time, and we both have seen many meteors and satellites during this time. This object, the description of both satellite and meteor. The object also dwindling, faded and dimmed later twice, and then raced away at the most astounding speed either of us has ever seen. It was first seen near the star Altair by the third member of our party in 1 less than 9:45 p.m. seconds had traversed about one-half of the sky going in a southerly direction towards the constellation Sagittarius. The estimated speed was about twenty thousand miles per minute judging from the speed of the satellites, and about thirty thousand miles per hour when it left us. This is the first time I had ever seen a UFO. so as I first I was a little skeptical as to whether or not this was a flying saucer so I did a little research on the subject.

Page 33, March 23, 1957, Midnight, Onard Air Force Base;
A large, round device flashing a brilliant red light was seen over the airbase as well as over Los Angeles. It hovered over one or two runways, climbed, and maneuvered swiftly over the area. The explanation of balloons was refuted by the Pasadena Air Filter Center.

Page 114, Nov. 2, 1957, 8 a.m., Clovis, New Mexico, an unusual, glowing object going in a southwesterly direction.

Page 115 and 117, Nov. 2, 1957, Amarillo, New Mexico. The CAA test pilot. Apparently a UFO was making a close observation of the Navy plane. Though it showed no sign of hostility, it maneuvered around the aircraft, its glow alternately dimming and growing brighter as it climbed and dived.

By this I mean that his statement gave us evidence as to whether or not the object (July 25) was a UFO or not. He said that there were no weather balloons in the area, and while he could not move as strangely as the object observed.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

As to the question of our observational capabilities, I submit these statistics:

[Redacted] last known as being near 140; vision- 20-20; amateur astronomer for the past 25 years; has seen meteors, comets, bright planets, satellites, and rainbows; average and above student.

I.Q.- last known to be over 125; vision- 20-20; has been an amateur astronomer for 25 years; has been pilot; bright planets, stars, meteors, and satellites; average and above student.

All of us have seen airplanes and helicopters and balloons; above average student. All of us were seen helicopters at night. This object was neither an airplane nor helicopter.

The second sighting took place three days later and was confirmed by six witnesses. The details are as follows:

At 9:55 p.m. C.D.S.T., the six of us saw an unusually bright object in the north. The object was doing fantastic maneuvers. It could travel in a westerly direction, stop/start, and then resume flying. The object eventually escaped our vision. The object itself was bright as the planet Venus and could be seen in the most at this time. We were fortunate enough to view this object through a telescope at 140 power. You will find our result on a little piece of paper enclosed. The red column was actually observed with an increase of speed. We followed the object for about four or five minutes until it was gone.

This time instead of being guesses as to whether this was a UFO, I called a well known television meteorologist, asking if there were any weather balloons doing tests in the northern Chicagoland area. He answered by saying that there were no balloons testing anywhere near Chicago. He suggested the idea of the object being one of the Echo satellites, but he later retracted this statement when I identified the motion of the object.

The other three members of the party are also very capable observers. Outside of the statistical 1.Q. above shown, I could obtain these of only one other. I.Q.- over 125; vision- 20-20; has seen all the objects as stated in the above descriptions.

This case can be compared to the Avrillio case in the sense that in both cases the object was doing fantastic maneuvers. There was an airplane in the vicinity, however, in the pilot had seen anything, he either did not report it or was told not to let it go beyond the airport.

I would now like to show the likeness and differences between these two sightings. Both the first and second object were green and both glowed. Fantastic maneuvers were performed by the two of these provide them to be or unconventional aerial-type objects, starting, and moving forward and backward are not characteristics of today's conventional aircraft). The directions in which these two objects are opposite: the July 25 object was going south while the July 23 object was going north. Like both hovered over something, I have concluded that the only things worth investigating over would be the elevation naval air station in the north and either Midway or O'Hare Airport in the south.

I am very sorry that I could not have had this letter in the mail any sooner. I realize that I have will now be in great account of skepticism concerning it. I was unaware of the fact that AFR 200-2 requires such a group reporting of UFOs. In conclusion, I would like to volunteer the services of my friends and myself for further observation of the UFOs and for my more information concerning our sightings. I would like several copies of the USAF Technical Information Sheet concerning UFOs sent to this address.

COMMENTS: During phone interview seemed to be reliable until further probing found that he had been in the Air Force and seemed to feel he was an authority on contrails, aircraft shapes, etc. Further probing found that he observed someone signaling by light in morse code (SOS) to the object. He saw the signals coming from a nearby hospital but could not remember the floor. It is to be noted that this observation was made on July 5th, a legal holiday with many fireworks displays throughout the city. Also the Chicago White Sox were playing a night game. At most of the night games fireworks are set off. This reporter feels that credibility of sighting is debatable because of the "SOS" report. Mr. was asked to submit a written report in his own words but has failed to do so to this date.

h. Not known by preparing officer.

i. Negative

j. Not known.

k. This particular report was called in to the O'Hare Base Operations Office. The geographical location is approximately six miles due east of Midway Airport. Surface winds at Midway Airport were out of the southwest. According to the report, the object was on a course from east to west with a turn to the northwest. It is conceivable that this could have been an aircraft landing at Midway Airport with an approach from east to west, then turning northwest on a down wind leg for a landing on Runway 22.

1. No physical evidence.
