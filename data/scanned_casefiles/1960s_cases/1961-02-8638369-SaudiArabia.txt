REPLY TO
ATTN OF:   OAI

SUBJECT:   Supplemental Physical Evidence on Unidentified Explosion and Smoke
           over Ras Tamura, Saudi Arabia, 23 February 1961

TO:        Air Technical Intelligence Center (AFCIN-AE4g)
           Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The following supplemental information and evidence is forwarded for
further consideration and analysis in connection with the unidentified
explosion in the air over Ras Tamura, Saudi Arabia, on Thursday, 23 Feb
1961, as reported by Major James W. Green, CO, 21st Weather Sq, Det 12,
this station, on 24 Feb 1961:

a.   Photographic.
     (1) Still photograph taken by observer in boat on Half Moon Bay,
     longitude 50.10 E, latitude 26.05 N. Formation resulting from flash explosion followed by
     series of minor consecutive explosions.

     (b) Two prints. Negative unobtainable.

     (2) Type and make of camera: AGFA-ISOLETT-120-2½x4.

     (3) Type focal length and make of lens: 1:4.5 - 85 MM AGFA.

     (4) Brand and type of film: Kodak Verichrome Pan.

     (5) Shutter speed used: 1/100.

     (6) Lens opening used: F-22.

     (7) No filter used.

     (8) Solid stand used: None. Held in boat, trolling slowly.

     (9) No panning used.

     (10) Camera pointing relative to true North, and angle to ground
     (water), North 45°.

b.   Material.
     Five fragments (one metallic and 4 charcoal-like), picked up by
     another observer on South Pier of Aramco refinery at Ras Tamura, Saudi
     Arabia, reported falling approximately 12 minutes after last explosion

heard. Fragments were turned in to Aramco officials who had tests run on the metal (fresh break) which they reported indicated presence of silver and highly magnetic with very slight radioactivity.

c. Additional Information:

Short flame, white smoke, and series of five consecutive explosions, very high in altitude, were reported by several observers at the Aramco compound and at this station. In one instance only was an object thought to be seen. Very small, just before the explosion, and one observer believed he saw a waterspout off the shore as if caused by a falling body shortly after the explosion.
