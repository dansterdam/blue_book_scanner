Dear Mr. President:

I am very interested in UFOs. Would you send me all the reports possible.

Another boy and I are starting a search. On march 24, 1965, we heard a noise and looked out the window. We saw a great big white light out the window flying at a very fast speed. Since then, we have been doing lots of research. We have a few instruments and are trying to track it. We would be very happy if you could get us some information.

Sincerely,

[Note: The signature is blacked out]

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the skies over the United States is the responsibility of the Air Force. The name of this project is Blue Book. A copy of this report is attached.

In 16 years of investigating over 9000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt that all reported aerial phenomena have been objects either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or the residue of meteoric activity.

There has never been any evidence that UFOs reported to the Air Force represented extraterrestrial vehicles. No such object reported to the Air Force has given any indication of a threat to the United States nor has any evidence been presented that any unidentified flying object exhibited characteristics beyond the scope of current technical or scientific knowledge.

The Air Force will continue to investigate all reports of unusual aerial phenomena over the United States. The evaluations and conclusions reached by the Air Force will be released to the public.

M/R: On 25 Mar 65 Peekskill, New York called.

He said he had a sighting to report. He saw the Gemini launch on television on 23 Mar 65 and saw some strange objects. He went on and on believing in flying saucers and would not listen to anything that Major Quintanilla had to say, he kept insisting that we were keeping things secret and should make it known that these vehicles were extraterrestrial and under intelligent control.
