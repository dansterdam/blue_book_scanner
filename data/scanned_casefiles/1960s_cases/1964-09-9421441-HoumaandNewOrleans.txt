Dear Sir:

Enclosed are two negatives of two stars taken at the request of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Dept. Each exposure was 30 seconds taken at the prime focus of the 11½ inch refractor here. The two stars are Alpha Auriga and Alpha Orionis. The exposure of Alpha Orionis was taken at 0910 U.T. (0310 C.S.T.) and Alpha Auriga at 0914 U.T. (0314 C.S.T.), the film used was Super Panatomic Press, developed 6 minutes in Microdol.

When at low altitude, these stars appeared to alternate colors, red - green. It is to be noted that these stars are rather red ( Orionis being considerably redder) and that the low altitude blue and white stars showed no red colors. This phenomenon is rather common for stars near the horizon. All of the objects observed to altitude red-green have proved to be stars, and nothing can be said as to the nature of the U.F.O.'s reported in the vicinity of Baton Rouge in relation to these stars.

Microscopic examination of the negatives showed nothing out of the ordinary with the exception of a slight elongation of the images of some of the fainter field stars which is probably due to some slight movement of the telescope. The aerial drive was on during the exposures, otherwise, the stars would appear as streaks. It is to be noted that the bright stars are very much over-exposed.

Prints were not made of the negatives, as they in actuality have little to do with the possible identification of Unidentified Flying Objects, other than the low altitude scintillation.

Sincerely yours,
Lewis M. Cook,
Student, L.S.U. Dept. of
Physics and Astronomy.

Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana
14 September 1964

State Representative Sees
UAO in Louisiana

We can thank Member Robert G. Achener for the information that State Representative Charles G. Smither of Jennings was observed a "shapeless, motionless metal object" over Lake Pontchartrain on Monday (September 14) at 11 a.m.

Smither and Moran had been to Michoud Plant and was returning to New Orleans via the bus when he saw the object. He and Alfred Moran, riding with him, at first thought the object was a jetliner as they had watched several as they made their way to the plant earlier in the morning.

Smither and Moran waited for the object to "take shape," but it didn't. It had no tail or wings. Smither watched it for at least 3 minutes and it didn't move. It had no definite shape. He glanced around in the bus and when he looked back the object was gone.

Paul Atkinson of the Times-Picayune of New Orleans, had an article about Smither's sighting in the 20 September 1964 issue and compared the Smither sighting with that of Eastern Air Lines Pilot Truman Gile in 1957 when Gile saw a "great, big, silvery shiny round object" when getting ready to take off from Lafayette field. He watched it for 3 minutes, then the object didn't move. From position—just failed away, he said.

Atkinson recapped UFO sightings in his article, including the Gile sighting and the sighting of a "round, luminous object" flying with jet-like speed over Lake Pontchartrain on August 8, 1949 by District Judge Pilver P. Schulmkamp, then Assistant District Attorney. It was trailing brilliant orange gaseous matter, moving southwest in the general direction of Michoud.
