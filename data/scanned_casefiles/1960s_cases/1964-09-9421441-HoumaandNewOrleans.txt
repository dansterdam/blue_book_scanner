Text from the document:

Commanding Officer 
Continental Air Defense Sector
Barksdale Air Force Base
Barksdale AFS, Louisiana

Dear Sir:

Enclosed are two negatives of two stars taken at the request of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office. On September 16, 1964, an apparent stellar object was photographed at 8:49 p.m. in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, over the Baton Rouge Airport. The film used was Agfa-Gevaert and alpha Orionis. The object of alpha Orionis was taken at 09:51. The film used was Konica. Both negatives are attached for your examination.

When at Louisiana State University, there appeared to alternate red-green lights. It is clearly noted that these stars are brighter and more clearly defined than the usual star images, and their alternation appears to indicate the presence of some metallic or reflecting object between the observer and the star field.

All objects observed to alternate red-green here proved to be of such a nature and that their image stability and freedom from background apparent motion was most unusual and remarkable.

Microscopic examination of the negatives showed nothing out of the ordinary with the exception of the slight movement of the fainter field stars which is probably due to some slight movement of the telescope. The center of the image showed no sign of any air turbulence or other distortion.

There were not made of the negatives, as they in actuality have little to do with the possible identification of Unidentified Flying Objects.

Sincerely yours,
Lewis M. Cook

The text appears to be discussing details related to visual observations and analysis of certain objects or events.

EVALUATION OF PHOTO ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

1. SUBJECT: Analysis of visual observations by Capt. John James, USN (Ret), OBSERVER (MODD)

2. By visual observations on the nights of 13 and 15 Sep 64 in the Houma and New Orleans area, Capt. James reports having seen and plotted unidentified lights and objects in the sky. These objects were observed to move at relatively high speeds, make 90 degree turns, and change directions and altitudes abruptly. Occasional hovering was also reported.

3. The objects were observed both individually and in groups of up to 5 or 6 objects at a time. The objects were observed for periods of up to 30 minutes during a given night. Motion and maneuverability of the objects, as described, is not characteristic of known aircraft, satellites, or other identifiable objects.

4. Capt. James has had considerable experience in visual observations of aircraft, satellites, and other objects in the sky, and is considered a reliable and competent observer.

5. FOR THE COMMANDER

State Representative Sees UAO in Louisiana

We can thank Member Robert G. Atchison for the information given here. He is a State Representative Charles G. Schiller, an electronics engineer, who was returning to New Orleans from the Michoud Plant and was returning to New Orleans from a consultaton in Baton Rouge. It was a very clear night, and Mr. Schiller saw a "metallic object" over Lake Pontchartrain on Monday (September 14) at 11:15 PM. He said he stopped his car and watched the object for about 5 minutes and it didn't move. He had no definite shape. He glanced at the time and when he looked back, the object was gone.
Paul Atkinson of the Times-Picayune of New Orleans, had an article in the September 16 edition, telling about this sighting in the Lake Pontchartrain area. He said the man claimed the object as about the size of a passenger jet, and it was a "glowing, dull silvery color". With that of Eastern Air Lines Pilot Truman Gifls in 1957 when a craft was "trailing a thin silver line behind it, and rotating, and it was getting ready to take off from Lafayette (sic). He watched it for 2 minutes, then the crew and they watched the craft make a "shallow angle climb out and then abrupt departure-just faded away, he said.
A Michoud plant engineer, including the sighting of the principal witness and the sighting of a "round, luminous object" over Lake Pontchartrain on August 31, by District Judge Driver P. Schilling, and Assistant District Attorney it was "between an estimated 600-1000 feet in altitude", was also mentioned.
