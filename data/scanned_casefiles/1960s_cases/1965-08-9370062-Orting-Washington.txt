11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Saucer shaped object, white about size of a basketball observed
at night with overcast. One object no features noted. Humplike
sound. Not accompanied by sound identification or broken profile.
Observed from car while driving. Object was hovering near a hill
and disappeared over the hill. Under observation for 2-3 minutes
near ground level. Object was in the east and did not change in
azimuth or elevation. No maneuvers, just went over the hill
along a road and 1/2 mile to observer.
Basically, dark night in county. Light only observed, invisible
after midnight. Given alone, likely misinterpretation of some
light such as an a/c or even a ground light on the hill. Not
stated whether there was a road on the hill or not.
