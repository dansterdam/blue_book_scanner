Memo, TDEW, 2 Sep 65, Request for Radar Analysis, 6 Aug 65, Louisville, Ky & Chicago, Ill

1st Ind. (TDEED/Capt Dunlap/pk)/74236)                                   8 Sep 65

TO: TDEW (Major Quintanilla)

1. The information contained in this report is insufficient to make a creditable radar analysis.

2. Although the message indicates the objects were characterized by slow movement, those first sited at 2940N, 8700W traveled to 4007N, 8624W before being lost. This means the objects moved about 620 NM in 45 minutes, a speed which could be viewed as other than slow movement. Request this possible discrepancy be reviewed.

3. Since the objects were reported by two distant radar stations, anomalous propagation can probably be ruled out as the cause. However, clarification as to whether or not both stations made observations simultaneously is needed. Additionally, it could be helpful to know whether or not a temperature inversion was existent in the area.

4. The altitude and described slow movement suggest the possibility of the objects being balloons. Balloons or certain materials can be observed via radar, and without further information concerning movement and/or speed are the best explanation of the observation.

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Reference your letter, TDEW, UFO Radar Returns, 6 Aug 65, Louisville, Ky & Chicago, Ill, dated 14 September 1965.

2. The position of the objects when first sited should have read 3940N, 8700W. The two radar sites concerned did not maintain continuous radar contact with the objects. Rather, the objects seemed to appear and disappear sporadically.

3. Objects were observed by both radar sites during the same time period; however, further investigation showed that the sites were not detecting the same objects.

4. There were no known temperature inversions in the area at the time of the detections.
