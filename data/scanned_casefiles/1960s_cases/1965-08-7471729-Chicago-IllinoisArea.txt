TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Memo: IDEW: 2 Sep 65. Request for Radar Analysis, 6 Aug 65, Louisville, KY to G (name blacked out).

1st Ind. (TDSED/Capt Dunlap/pk)/74236)

TO: TDSW (Major Quintanilla)

1. The information contained in this report is insufficient to make a complete analysis.

2. Although the message indicates the objects were characterized by slow movement, discontinuous flight path, 8,700K traveled to 6,000'N, 8'24' before being lost. This means the objects moved about 620 NM in 43 minutes, which could be claimed as other than A-low (over 600 KTS).

3. Since the objects were reported by two distant radar stations, some determination could be made as to whether or not both stations made observations simultaneously. Additionally, it could be helpful to know whether or not a temperature inversion was existent in the area.

4. The altitude and descriptive data furnished suggest the possibility of certain materials can be confused with balloons by radar. Radar data and further information concerning movement and direction of travel of the objects would be helpful in making a more conclusive evaluation.

TO: AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND 
SPECIAL PROJECTS DIY (SDEW)

1. Reference your letter, TDEW, UFO Radar Returns, 6 Aug 65, Louisville, KY & Chicago, ILL, dated 14 September 1965.

2. The position position given of the objects (approximately 30 miles to the south of Chicago) have read 3940N, 8700W. The two radar sites concerned did not make positional identifications under contact. Rather, the objects seemed to appear and disappear sporadically.

3. Objects were observed by both radar sites during the same time period; however, further investigation showed that the sites were not detecting the same objects.

4. There were no known temperature inversions in the area at the time of the detections.
