Dear Sir:

In March of this year I notified your department of an unusual sighting and subsequent 8 mm movie films I made of this sighting. I was advised by your office to fill out a questionnaire sent me and to forward the questionnaire and film to your command for evaluation. I was further advised that my film would be returned to me along with a report on your findings. I filled out the questionnaire and mailed it and my film to you in May of this year. As of this date I have had no reply from you. Other than an answer to an inquiry I had made several months ago stating that 'Due to the number of unusual sightings being made there was a slight delay in the processing of my film'.

Sir, I believe that six months is surely enough time for your people to examine the film I have sent you and while you may for some reason be reluctant to offer an explanation, (or unable to) I would greatly appreciate the return of my film.

I look forward to hear from you at your earliest possible convenience.

Dear Sir,

In May of this year I contacted your outfit regarding the sighting of several U Os. Twenty five feet of 8mm color films were taken of the sighting and as you forwarded the film to you. I was told by you that after examining the pictures you would return them to me with the results of your investigation. As of this date I have heard nothing from you concerning either the sighting or the film. I am needless to say very much interested in finding out exactly what it was that I observed. I am also very much interested in having my films returned to me.

I would very much like to hear from you about the above mentioned at your earliest possible convenience. If it is at all possible I should also like to receive some enlargements of the pictures. Thanking you in advance for a speedy reply I remain

Truly yours,

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The data I have filled in on this questionnaire are approximate. Each duty of sighting you write finds in my original letter of you. As I mentioned in the letter I awoke early that particular Sunday morning and was standing on my terms observing the skyline of the east and watching the sky get lighter as the sun was about to rise. I sighted the object and observed them for about 1/2 hour. During this time I wrote my wife and she saw them too. I also have at this time (call I have at the time) when the sun came up I could no longer see the object because of the glare. The longer of the object seemed to wobble a bit but that was the only motion that I could notice. As you view the film you will find the large object is much clearer toward the end of film. I found that with my projector I saw the objects clearer when I made a smaller image. That is I had the projector rather close to the screen. Toward the beginning of the film you will notice all the objects (although very small) are in a straight line. The object on the far left is the one that appears from me to be larger and this is the one I concentrated on later in the film. These last few from

Dear Sirs:

I would like to report seeing several unidentified flying objects sighted last Sunday (3/19/67) morning from 6:00 AM thru 6:45 AM. I live in Yonkers New York and made this sighting from my 17king room window which faces to the east toward Long Island Sound. The objects appeared to be flying or floating just above the sound I would guess about 150 feet high. I instead reporting this to my one until the 8 mm movie film I took of the objects came back developed. To be honest I really wasn't sure myself after thinking about it all week. However the film did come back and the objects are definitely there. I live on the 16th floor of a 19 story apartment building and although the objects were quite some distance away from no I did see them fairly clearly as my pictures will prove.

Kindly write me as to what you feel I should do with these films. I will in the meanwhile hold on to them until I hear from you.

Truly yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
