Performing OCR on the text in the document:

On the evening of April 17, 1968, my wife and I had just returned to our apartment parking lot. The time was a few minutes before 11:00 p.m. As I got out of the car, a man who had gotten out suddenly called excitedly to look at something.

I got out quickly, glanced up, and saw a strange formation of bright lights. My attention was first drawn to a pair of bright lights, which seemed to be suspended at a low altitude. At the same time, I noticed two other objects, one to the left and one to the right just ahead of the pair of yellow lights. A V-formation of six yellow-white lights was formed by these objects. These objects were moving in a steady, straight course at moderate speed. I watched the formation as it continued on its course, the same speed and altitude. The only audible sound was a slight hissing, which seemed to come from the direction of the objects. After a few seconds the formation disappeared from view behind the horizon. I kept pace with the other lights until they way by the horizon.

When the objects were overhead (before I emerged from the car), I would have noticed certain odd aspects of the sighting. They moved erratically and abruptly, as if they were not bound by normal physical laws. The lights were of an entirely different character than those belonging to ordinary aircraft. They gave the impression of being intelligently controlled. I had an almost fluorescent quality, shining with a dim glow. The sky was clear. There were no other conventional aircraft.

My wife and I live at 15-C Charlestown, Apt., Bexley, Ohio.

English teacher sights UFO in Ipswich
"The whole of an object, first seemed to be an airplane, changed shape and then assumed the shape of a dirigible gas bag type, just above the top of the trees," said Mrs. Harold Siverly.
"After it started to move away, it took the shape of a great mass of light, high in the sky and we did our best to follow up till it disappear the - light across the sky in a matter of seconds, leaving no trace."
Mrs. Siverly and her daughter, Nancy, Mill Road, Ipswich, were describing an incident which happened to them last Friday between 7 and 7:15 p.m.
They left their house on the Warburg lane to pick up Mrs. Siverly's aunt, who was preparing for the family engagement party at their home.
"As we got to the end of our driveway, we noticed this great mass of light, high in the sky," said Mrs. Siverly. "They seemed to be sever­light." al hundred feet in diameter, it was definitely not a star­shaped object and was moving in a steady course."
Mrs. Siverly and her daugther rushed into the house to tell other family members about what they had seen. They then returned outside and watched the object for about five minutes.
"It was almost parallel to the ground and like a star, but considerably larger and brighter," they said. Both Mrs. Siverly and her daughter had the distinct impression that it was either a jet or another object of some kind.
"It just disappeared," she said.
Other UFOs
Earlier last week other "light masses" were reported by at least a half dozen people in nearby areas. The writer corresponded with what Mrs. Siverly said, though Mrs. Siverly had not heard about them.
Mrs. Edward M. Green, Sage Gardens, and her daughter's friend of 19 years standing, saw a light in the sky several evenings ago. Mrs. Green said the light was seen in the same direction in which Jeffrey Reed said he had been while walking along Jeffrey Reed road, not far away.
The object followed Mrs. Green's car for some distance, she said.

Mr. Shively pulled onto Caroline street, stopped his car and yelled down to her window to save a life.
When we first saw it thought it was an airplane. But after we stopped, the great mass of light seemed to light dimmed in size and then went out, and that was the last we saw of it.
They said the daughter Sherry, who was also to be 4'4", saw the two lights as they did, then saw a third.
It was much smaller than the other two and was red.
They said, "Those three lights at first appeared to be in a line, but as they grew dimmer, they appeared to be in a triangular shape as they moved away in a different direction, as it had come, a appeared to be receding from us.

"It was stopped only for a few seconds," she said. "Then it seemed to turn around."

When it did, said Mrs. Shelley, she saw the two lights at a higher altitude that seemed to be a thing.

"It was much smaller than the other two and was a as if it were in the same plane. Then, as it started to go back in indistinctly the Pleigy," someone had said.

That was the end of the sighting, according to what Mrs. Shelley had told him, as she appeared to be frightened.

"We just completed an investigation into the matter as it was last week," he said, "and people there who reported seeing the triangle of lights. Parker said they do not yet know what the object was. The Air Police radar station at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton does not indicate anything unusual on their radar screens, he said.

Asked if they picked up any physical objects, Parker said, "No, not a thing."

The article describes an incident where a woman in Malden, Massachusetts reported seeing a small object, described as the size of a child's doll house, flying around her home in the early morning hours of Saturday, April 22, 1968. Police responded to the call but were unable to locate either a flying saucer or a doll. The article indicates that the object was not a conventional aircraft.

Tiny UFO Floats
By Malden Home

Miniature space travelers riding in a flying 
saucer-no bigger than a doll house were reported
visitors to Malden over the weekend--at least ac-
cording to a report made to police by a Malden
woman.

Shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday, according to
the woman, she was awakened by a strange 
noise. Getting out of bed to look out through her un-
done bedroom window, she saw an object about the 
size of a child's doll house, flying around her home.

The woman said that she object had lights and 
seemed to float through the air, then disappear be-
hind the steeple of Holy Cross Cemetery across from
her house.

It definitely was not a conventional aircraft,
the woman asserted.

Police who responded to the woman's home 
after she reported the sighting, looked around but 
were unable to locate either a flying saucer or a doll 
house.

NICAP MASS SIGHTING UFO REPORT # 6-26 - Maiden, Mass. - 20 APRIL 1968 - 2:00AM
SIGHTING BACKGROUND By - Raymond E. Fowler
I received a telephone call from the Maiden Police Department on Saturday morning, April 20, 1968, informing me that at 2:35 AM a resident of Maiden, Massachusetts had reported that her mother had seen a UFO earlier that morning.
The young lady who called me stated that her mother, who wished to remain anonymous, had observed a lighted object in the sky from her home between 2:00 and 2:15 AM that morning. It was described as a domed-shaped object with a pointed top and surrounded by a reddish glow. Its estimated size was 40-50 feet in diameter and it was about 500 feet in altitude. It hovered for several minutes, made a loud "swishing" sound, and then descended in a fluttering motion as if it would seemingly catch itself and rise up again. After descending, it disappeared from sight.
I immediately contacted Investigators Hynek and Salvatore and dispatched them to the scene. They were able to interview the witness at her home at 4:00 PM and the following is a consolidation of their investigation.
THE WITNESS
Mrs. Power is a 60 year old widow who lives with her unmarried son and daughter. She was awakened from her sleep around 2:00 AM by the presence of a bright light in her bedroom. Looking out the window, she observed the large, domed-shaped object at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. Initially, she appeared tense and a bit overwhelmed at the instance created by her encounter with the phenomenon in question.
FIRST PERSON NARRATIVE By Robert Salvatore
I was awakened at approximately 2:00 AM on the morning of April 20, 1968 by a loud noise which sounded like a electric motor. Looking out the window, I observed a large, hovered object, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, about 500 feet off the ground. It had a bright, glowing dome on top and a reddish glow surrounding the object. I got out of bed and walked about 3 feet to a window looking east at an angle of about 50 degrees (using the house as a particular) and observed the object hovering and moving slowly from right to left. It appeared to float as it moved slowly. As the object moved, the reddish glow appeared to fluctuate, with a pulsating motion. After about a minute, the object appeared to float to my left (NW) out of my vision. It appeared at this point to float out of my house. I shortly thereafter heard a loud "whooshing" sound and a vibration which I felt through the floor. The sound was like the sound of a large engine being throttled up and then throttled down. It lasted approximately 2-3 seconds. The object did not stop or behave in any manner which might indicate the arrival or departure of occupants. During the time interval of the sighting, 2 to 3 cars went directly behind the house, but did not stop or behave in any manner which might indicate the arrival or departure of occupants.

DETAILED SIGHTING ACCOUNT
By - Herbert Eismann

Mrs. Power retired early Friday evening and was awakened at approximately 2:30 A.M. Saturday morning by a noise. She looked out the window and observed a large, round, luminous object in the sky. She could not find words to describe the scene. The object appeared to be hovering about 150 yards away. However, the noise disappeared when the object seemed to move rapidly away, passing behind trees and out of sight. 

The object was moving in a NE direction, drifting slowly and appearing quite large. It was about the size of a small airplane or large helicopter, completely silent, and illuminated with a soft white light. The object passed in front of trees, indicating it was relatively close to the ground. Mrs. Power did not hear any unusual sounds or detect any odor.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
I. ESTIMATED SIZE OF OBJECT
Assuming that Mrs. Power's estimate that the object was 5 inches in diameter and 200 feet away is correct, then the maximum size of the object would have been about 5"/.24°° = 2Yz" = 12000" - x = 500" or about 40'.

II. SUGGESTED EXPLANATIONS - PROS & CONS
A. German Box Balloon, Hoax
1. Foam
a. Size at arms-length could have been exaggerated or object was much closer than realized.
b. Objec+s configuration somewhat similar to Garment Bag Balloon.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image provided. The image shows a scanned page from a UFO report document.

NICAP MASS SUBCOM UFO REPORT # 65-26 (continued)
Sheet 3

c. The fact that it seemed to "disappear" when it approached the tree-line in the encounter. No attempt was made to identify the object, nor was the object said to give off any distinguishing sounds, smells, or any other indicia other than its apparent behavior.

d. These balloons have exhibited erratic motions due to wind and internal temperature changes.

2. Case Summary 
a. Size at arms-length would have had to be grossly exaggerated if object were in reality a 3-4 foot Gorment Bag Balloon.
b. The object was always moving against the wind.
c. The up-and-down motion and the "descending 'loon'" descent are typical UFO characteristics. 
d. The object appeared highly luminous and had a secondary light seemingly emanating from the object, and the sound heard has been reported in association with other UFO sightings.
e. Garment Bag reports in our files usually describe either small orange lights or dark objects with small orange lights. However, this light was close enough to be well defined and would appear larger.
f. Pointed-top and rounded bottom have been characteristics of other UFO sightings although but I do not remember those characteristics described as singular (to) this incident. 

B. Harm to witness
1. Face - No one close reported the UFO and cars went by when it was crossing the road.
2. Case - Occupants in the car may just not have noticed object or noticed it but did not want to report it. Also, there is no apparent motive or personal indication of a hoax by the witness.

C. Psychological Illusion

Which of necessity was viewable to the car's passengers, seems to this investigator, Considering further that his husband's death occurred a recent (i.e. two) two years before and that his statement most certainly an understandable, 'tends to discredit this sighting as a possible "illusion",' understandable, tends to discredit this sighting
as a possible "illusion".

Cona By~Chairman Raymond Fowler
I have already commented on the reasons why perhaps no one else reported the object, as the cars apparently got near to the next turn, where the lights of the nearby town, under the present night conditions, masked its visibility. Any reason as to explain the object and the associated noises due to an illusion, brought on by personal grievance for a husband who died a ago is at a best highly subjective and improbable in light of all the reported details. It is possible but only remotely improbable.

CHAIRMAN'S EVALUATION
The overall factors associated with this sighting, and the fact that crock place occurred within Middlesex County, Massachusetts, prompt me to place this sighting in the "unknown" category.

Respectfully submitted,

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
The witnesses say they were sitting on their porch and looked out the window. She saw a round object carrying a flashing red light on the underside of something passing about 1500 feet away (estimated). She called to her husband to come and look at it but he did not want to be disturbed. After a few minutes the object dropped straight down behind the trees very slowly. A minute later it descended straight up and hovered again.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES APRIL 22-28, 1968

The charts in this publication are a 
continuation of the principal charts 
in the Weather Bureau's publication, 
the Daily Weather Map. They include 
the Surface Weather Map, the 500-milli-
bar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temper-
ature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation 
Chart. All of the charts on this page are 
arranged on a single page of this publi-
cation. The operational weather maps prepared by 
the United States Weather Bureau at 
Washington, D.C. are the source.

The High-Low Temperature Chart presents 
the highest and lowest temperatures at the 
principal weather stations, which are the same 
as those used regularly in the Daily Weather Map. 
An explanatory sheet is available, and 
may be obtained by writing to: 
Environmental Science Services Administration, 
C&GS 12143, Rockville, Maryland 20852

The Surface Weather Map presents 
station data and the analysis for 7:00 
a.m. e.s.t.

The areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
symbols are used in the legend for
a fraction of those that are included
in the operational weather maps on
which the analyses are based. Only 
the principal lines of the 500-millibar
contours are shown, and the contours
are labeled in decagrams per square
centimeter. The arrows show the wind
direction and speed at the 500-millibar
level.

The Highest and Lowest Temper-
atures Chart presents the maximum
and minimum values for the 24-hour 
period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The 
names of the reporting points can be 
obtained from the Surface Weather 
Map. The maximum temperature is 
plotted above the station location, and 
the minimum temperature is plotted
below this point.

The Precipitation Ares and Amount
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation on 
the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. 
e.s.t. Amounts of precipitation in 
hundredths of an inch are for the same 
period. Incomplete totals are indi-
cated by the symbol "T".

Departures from normal are shown 
in the upper right hand corner. Amounts of 
snow on the ground in inches as of 
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

  ARCANUM, OHIO
  APRIL 6, 1968
  UTO CASE 68-14

  At 1745 hours on April 6, 1968, Mr. JOSEPH BAER, an insurance adjuster from Arcanum, Ohio, observed a bright unidentified light hovering in the sky approximately 5 miles southwest of Arcanum, Ohio.

  Mr. BAER was driving southwest on State Route 49 at the time. He stated that the object was hovering at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and appeared to be about 300 feet in diameter. The object was illuminated with a bright white light and remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight to the southwest.

  JOSEPH BAER described the object as round or disc-shaped and stated that he could see no wings, tail or other protrusions. He also stated that the object made no sound.

  This incident has been classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
