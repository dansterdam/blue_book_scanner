SIGHTING ACCOUNT
Witness was driving South on Route 1A, Hamilton, Mass. She was startled to see a strange vehicle just above trees, almost touching them, just off the road to her right. She slowed the car and brought it to a stop about 150 feet from the object. 15 just hovered there and had two steady lights - a white one on its left and a red one on its right. She rolled down the window to get a better view and to see if she could hear it. No sound was heard. As she watched it, 2-3 cars flashed by but if anyone saw it, they did not stop. After hovering silently for about 2-3 minutes, the object moved extremely slowly over fields and woods towards the NE. Upon returning home, she told her husband who is a selectman and well-known figure in this area. He said it would be best not to report it for fear of ridicule. However, when the Wenham weekly paper carried an article on another sighting, she felt that she should report it and called Raymond Fowler, Assistant MUFON Investigator Richard Fowler to investigate the following day.

SKETCH OF UFO:
[A hand-drawn sketch of an elongated object with two lights]

REMARKS:
Both the witness and her husband are above average "solid citizens" and are well-known individuals within town government and public activities. The witness is not the type that would exaggerate and seemed to give an accurate account of her experience. Her sighting comes amidst a flurry of sightings - R. Mass.

In your own words, Please describe the incident as it happened. (If additional pages are needed, be sure they are numbered.)

I was driving down route 1... I had been at the Summer home in 9 parish and was in a hurry to get back to Wenham. It was dark. As I drove along I noticed sometley above the trees that looked strange. I was hovering near me. I stepped the car and lowered the wind... and looked out at it. There was no noise. It was a vehicle of some sort with lights. I watched it for a couple of minutes. As I watched it went off silently just the distance. I went home and immediately told my husband. I said that if it came out in the paper I had seen a UFO.

4/22/68

On the evening of April 17, 1968, my wife and I had just returned to our apartment parking lot. The time was a few minutes before 10:00 p.m.EST. I was still in the driver's seat of the car when Zinn, who had gotten out, suddenly called excitedly to look up and rapped sharply on the door.

I got out quickly, glanced up, and saw a strange formation of lights passing overhead at what seemed to be a low altitude, heading southeast. My attention was first drawn to a pair of bright yellowish lights and the sound of a jet aircraft. Almost in the same instant, I saw what had caused my wife's shouts. To the right and just ahead of the pair of yellow lights was a V-formation of six light, diffuse, with slightly yellowish arranged in three pairs. These objects were moving in a steady, straight course at moderate speed with what I assume was the maintaining the same speed and course but slightly behind the formation. The only audible sound we heard seemed to come from one jet. If the others were conventional jets, their noise should have been evident but this was not the case.

We continued to watch for perhaps twenty seconds or so until the formation disappeared in the distance over the southeast horizon. The jet kept pace with the other lights all the way to the horizon.

When the objects were overhead (before I emerged from the car), I had the impression that each pair of first lights was connected by a reddish tube of light. As the objects moved away, she and I failed to see or notice this glow between the lights.

The sky was clear. There were no other conventional aircraft in the sky at the time.

Except for certain odd aspects of the sighting, I would have ordinarily classified our observation as a DL. However, the faint lights were of an entirely different character than those belonging to jets. These were no similarly (except they also were in pairs). They had an almost fluorescent quality, shining with a dim fuzzy glow instead of the well-defined bright star-like sources on conventional jets. Another peculiar feature was the lack of sound.

We both felt we heard the sound of only one jet which was clearly identifiable as the object behind the formation. Although I am reluctant to admit flight, I can honestly state I have never saw anything quite like this before. A pair of binoculars might have helped solve the mystery (since a pair was stolen once from my car). I do not expect to ever again make this observation as a good sighting, it just, in my own mind, remains unidentified.

My wife and I live at 15-9 Charlesbank Way, Waltham, Mass.

NICAP MASS REPORT # 68-25 - 19 April 1968, 7:00 PM EST, Wenham, Mass.

INVESTIGATORS REPORT                                   - By Robert Jackson

The witnesses were leaving their home between 7:00 and 7:15 PM. They came out of their driveway onto 181B Road which runs on Wallingfield Road, Mass. Upon turning out on the street, they noticed an almost shapeless mass of bright white light about the size of a full moon. It was seen above and in front of their windshield at about a 35° elevation and was moving along the general course of the road heading SSW. They took chase and stayed with it for about a mile until it started to turn. At this point they were at the intersection of Wallingfield Road which heads SE. She attempted to turn the car around but stopped and turned the motor off and rolled down the windows.

No sound came from the object. At this point the object had separated into 2 white light sources with a small red light off to the right. This red light was also steady. He picked up speed in its new NNE direction and the witnesses started down Wallingfield Road in pursuit. They were able to keep it in view most of the time but it began to fade and get smaller until it just spread as 1 light source in the distance (NNE). Then, while they were watching with the car moving slowly at a good vantage point, the light source dropped another light source which descended at an angle and moved away to L. Immediately after that, a conventional aircraft went overhead in the exact direction of the light source which dropped to a lower altitude and moved away.

Mrs. Shively is above average intelligence. She is an English teacher at the Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School. Her husband is president of the North Shore Community College. She was very descriptive and her daughter agreed with most of the pertinent details of the sighting.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS                                    - By Raymond E. Fowler

My first thought was that aircraft landing lights were being observed but several factors seem to rule this out: Lack of noise at an apparent close range; no identification running lights noticed. (one steady red light was seen during one point of the sighting; and) the fact that the object (light mass) dropped a smaller object (light) which descended, levelled out and took off in another direction. The fact that a conventional plane was seen and heard during the sighting was easily recognizable. It is possible that this plane was intercepting the UFO but this is subjective speculation. Although the report is similar to a landing light "Unknown".

"Great mass of light"

#68-25

English teacher sights UFO in Ipswich

We came out of our drive... it was an airplane changed when the object started to move

Mrs. Harold Shively and her daughter Nancy, Mill Road, began something an incident which happened to them last Friday between 7 and 7:15.

They left their home on the way to pick up Mrs. Shively's son, who was preparing for the track, periodical primary at Ipswich High. As soon as they pulled out of their driveway, they saw in the distance what Mrs. Shively, an English teacher at Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School, described as a "great massive light, not a movement or pulsating but steady."

Mrs. Shively and her daughter decided to follow the "mass of light" which she described as "not having any noticeable structure... definitely not shaped."

They chased it just across the Ipswich town line into Hamilton, where it seemed to stop.

Mrs. Shively pulled onto Goodhue Street, stopped her car and rolled down her window to have a look.

"I've never first saw it thought it was an airplane. But just after we stopped, the great mass of light seemed in altitude from the time we started chasing it, almost as if it was motionless and was dimmer by the time we stopped."

"It was a great mass of light, high away, back in the direction we go to the air and we to head had just come from, a fourth light until we caught up to it."

"It was like a falling star," said Nancy.

"Yes," said Mrs. Shively, "but after it held for a distance it moved off and moved vertically away from the three lights."

Neither Mrs. Shively nor her daughter could estimate the speed of the object, because they were too high.

However, Mrs. Shively said, they saw an airplane going in the same direction as the three lights after it started moving after apparently stopping.

"It was almost parallel to the lights," she said.

She and her daughter both heard the airplane but had no idea whether it was a jet or a propeller driven craft.

Mrs. Shively said the whole incident took only about "four or five minutes."

Other UFOs Earlier last week other "light masses" were reported by at least a half dozen people in Ipswich and their description corresponding with what Mrs. Shively saw, though Mrs. Shively had not heard about them.

Mrs. Edward M. Green, Sage Road, Ipswich, and her three children and a friend of theirs spotted the same type of unidentified object while driving along Jeffrey Neck Road last week.

The object followed Mrs. Shively.

- page 46 -

Here is the text from the document:

Mrs. Shively pulled onto Ipswich, and their description corresponded with what Mrs. Green and rolled down her window. Shirley May, the girl, had not heard about them.

"When we first saw it I thought it was an airplane. But not after we stopped. The great mass of light dimmed in altitude from the time we started chasing it about one or two minutes and was dimmer by the time we stopped."

"They," said Mrs. Shively, "I saw it had split into two parts."

Her daughter Nancy, who was able to watch, more closely during the chase, said the light split up yet before it stopped moving.

"It was stopped only for a few seconds," she said. "Then it seemed to turn around."

When it did, said Mrs. Shively, she saw the two lights at first, then saw a third.

"It was much smaller than the other two and was red," she said. "These three lights of a very bright Pro-first appeared to be in a line. Yet, confirmed that the other two lights in Ipswich just some time Friday. This as it started with what Mrs. Shively saw last to go back in a northerly the Friday.

"We just completed an investigation into the matter in Ipswich last week," he said, "and people there also reported seeing the triangle of lights."

Fowler said they do not yet know what the object was.

The Air Force radar station asked if they picked up any unusual object Friday night, and they said, "No, not a thing."

Diagram shows the path the "light mass" took while Mrs. Harold Shively and her daughter, Nancy, followed it from their home on Mill road in Ipswich.

The rest of the page contains an advertisement for Volkswagen introducing the Automatic Stick Shift, which is "Available for Immediate delivery" with a diagram showing Drive 1, Drive 2, and Low Range. The ad states: "The automatic stick shift is an option: You pay a little more. But you do a little less."

There is also a small advertisement for Duraclean, offering "Time to have your Rugs and Furniture cleaned" with work done in your own home.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

"It was stopped only for a few seconds," she said. "Then it started to turn around.

When it did, said Mrs. Shively, she saw the two lights at first, then saw a third.

"It was much smaller than Early Warning Commander for the alert line and not red," to the Air Force Sponsored Civilian UFO Reporting Center. "These three lights in a way of Colorado UFO first appeared to be in a line, but not red."

Then, as it started to go back in a relatively the Friday.

That was when the high school English teacher, whose home is in the North Shore Community College area, thought it might get an airplane again. However, she said, the object made no noise.

"It was a pretty high altitude," she said. "I couldn't guess just also how far went the what, and that could have been was. But the reason we didn't hear anything," she said, but Mrs. Shively's idea that they said, "No, not a thing."

Raymond Fowler of Wakham, Chairman of the Massachusetts Subcommittee for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, Washington, DC, and Early Warning Commander for Civilian UFO Sponsored Center, confirmed that the other people in the area also reported UFO sightings in Joppa and other plane. Then, as it started with Mrs. Shively said it to go back in a relatively the Friday.

Tiny UFO Floats
By Malden Home

Miniature space travelers riding in a flying saucer no bigger than a doll house were weekend visitors to Malden over the weekend—at least according to a report made to police by a Malden woman.

Shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday, according to the report, the woman was awakened by a strange noise. Getting out of bed to look out through her window, the woman said she saw an object about the size of a child's doll house, flying around her home.

The woman said that the object had lights and seemed to float through the air, then disappear behind the chapel of Holy Cross Cemetery across from her home.

It definitely was not a conventional aircraft, the woman asserted.

Police who responded to the woman's home after she telephoned the station, looked around but were unable to locate either a flying saucer or a doll house.

NICAP MASS SIGHTING UFO REPORT # 68-26 - Malden, Mass. - 20 April 1968 - 2:00AM

SIGHTING BACKGROUND                                                By - Raymond E. Fowler

I received a telephone call from the Malden Police Department on Saturday morning, April 20, 1968 informing me that at 2:40 AM, the station had received a telephone call from the daughter of a Mrs. Mary Power who reported that her mother had seen a UFO earlier that morning.

I phoned the witness who described the object as somewhat "basket-shaped" with a pointed bottom, pointed top and "glowing red all over". Her initial impression of size was that it was a "doll-house" but later this estimate was found to be inaccurate. It made a loud "twanging sound" and moved in a "up-and-down" motion as it progressed along. After descending, in a fluttering motion it would seemingly catch itself and rise straight up.

I immediately contacted Investigators Eismann and Salvatore and dispatched them to interview Mrs. Power that same afternoon. The interview took place at her home at 4:00 PM and the following is a consolidation of their reports to me on the investigation.

THE WITNESS                                                        By - Robert Salvatore

Mrs. Power is a 60 year old widow who lives with her unmarried son and daughter. She seemed very sincere and earnest in her desire to cooperate, to the extent of being seemingly easily led conversationally. Initially, she appeared tense and a bit overwhelmed at the miniature furor she created by her encounter with the phenomenon in question.

FIRST PERSON NARRATIVE                                             By Robert Salvatore

I was awakened at approximately 2:00 AM on the morning of April 20, 1968 by a very loud noise which sounded like two stainless steel knives being struck together. I got out of bed and walked about 3 feet to a window that looks out toward the front of the house which faces Broadway, Malden.

Looking SE at an angle of about 50° (using the house as a perpendicular) I saw a large red-lighted object. Solid in character and at the base. It appeared to float as it moved to my left (NE) out of view due to the obstruction of the front of the house overlooking the cemetery which had a large portion of Holy Cross Cemetery. The object was again in sight and moving in a location across an altitude of 100 and perhaps 350 feet. Its motion resembled a piece of paper which is carried airborne by a gust of air. At times it seemed the object was viewing me so I pulled down the shade.

After about 1 minute of viewing, the object disappeared behind a tree. The tree was not in bloom so the object was not hidden by the tree. The object simply was no longer visible when it reached the tree, which was at an angle of about 60° (again, using the front of the house as a perpendicular). The sound which awakened me initially could not be heard when I reached my second viewing point (the room at the front of the house). It took me roughly 5 seconds to go from the rear bedroom (my initial viewing point) to the front bedroom (second viewing point). I have never before heard a sound quite like the one which I associate with the object in question.

During the time interval of the sighting, 2 or 3 cars went directly beneath the bedroom window from which I was watching the object. They did not stop or draw in any manner which might indicate the drivers were viewing the phenomena.

NICAP MASS SUBCOM UFO REPORT # 68-26 (continued)                Sheet 2

DETAILED SIGHTING ACCOUNT                                   By - Herbert Eismann

Mrs. Power retired early Friday evening and was awakened at approximately 2:00 AM by an unusual sound coming through her open bedroom window. (This window faces in a SSE direction). She could not find words to describe the sound except in terms of it being metallic and vibrating.

My impression from her description was that it resembled the noise from a tuning fork. However, the noise disappeared when she moved away from the open window. Upon hearing the noise she got out of bed, pulled up the venetian blind and looked out. She saw a light floating over the street (Route #1, Broadway, Haldon) approximately 20-30 feet high. She then put on her glasses and looked again. The object was very narrow, tall and narrow, appeared cylindrical with a point on top and was glowing a reddish color. It was not bright enough to illuminate her room.

The object was moving in a NE direction, drifting slowly and appearing to float very and form. It moved from the Holy Cross Cemetery across from the house and continued to watch the object's progress. It moved over the cemetery passing approximately 200 feet from the house, then in-front-of a church in the cemetery and finally as it came to a clump of trees it just disappeared. It is logical to assume that based on its direction that it went behind the trees and a building that stands on the edge of the cemetery thus passing out-of-view. The total sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes. The distance travelled would be about 150 yards. Approximate sighting to disappearance.

When Mrs. Power's daughter arrived home she called the police to report the incident. As far as Mrs. Power was concerned, no police were sent to investigate. (Chairman's note: police did not investigate but did not see or find anything). No one else in the area reported seeing the object according to the police. During the sighting, Mrs. Power said one or two cars went by the house travelling rather fast and gave no indication that the occupants had noticed anything in the cemetery.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:                                        By - Raymond E. Fowler

I. ESTIMATED SIZE OF OBJECT

Assuming that Mrs. Power's estimate that the object was 5 inches tall at arm's length and that the object did pass in-front-of trees 200 feet away, then the maximum size of the object would have been about 40 feet tall.

5"/24" = x/2400" - 24x = 12000" - x = 500" or about 40'

II. SUGGESTED EXPLANATIONS - PROS & CONS

A. Garment Bag Balloon Hoax

1. Pros
a. Size at arm's length could have been exaggerated or object was much closer than realized.
b. Object's configuration somewhat similar to Garment Bag Balloon.


- page 54 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

NICAP MASS SUBCOM UFO REPORT # 68-26 (continued)                Sheet 3

c. The fact that it seemed to "disappear" when it approached the tree-line in the cemetery. It could have become entangled, ripped open and the candles extinguished. No garment bag was noticed in these trees but the investigators neglected to search around the cemetery.

d. These balloons have exhibited eccentric motions due to wind and internal temperature changes.

12. Cons

a. Size at arms-length would have had to be grossly exaggerated if object were in reality a 3-4 foot Garment Bag Balloon.

b. The object was always moving against the wind.

c. The up-and-down motion and the "fluttering leaf" descent are typical UFO characteristics.

d. The balloon theory does not account for the loud sound seemingly emanating from the object, and, the sound heard has been reported in association with other UFO sightings.

e. Garment Bag reports in our files usually describe either small orange lights or dark objects with small orange lights (however, if the bag were close enough, it would appear larger). The witness indicated it seemed to glow "all over".

f. Pointed-Top and rounded bottom have been characteristics of other UFO sightings although but I do not remember these characteristics as regarding the cylindrical type UFO.

B. Hoax by witness

1. Pros - No one else reported the UFO and cars went by when it was in sight over the cemetery.

2. Cons - Occupants in the car may just not have noticed object or noticed it but did not want to report it. Also, there is no apparent motive or personal indication of a hoax by the witness.

C. Psychological Illusion

1. Pros By - Robert Salvatore, Engineering Psychologist

Aerodynamically, this sighting can be best explained as unidentified and highly suspicious. Even the plastic bag hoax cannot adequately explain this occurrence. However, the subject herself may hold the key to a reasonable, terrestrially-related explanation. For almost two hours after the end of the event, the subject remained quite until her daughter arrived home. She was her daughter who confirmed her to phone the police and report the event. The subject did not seem to have any particular apprehension about the sighting. Continually conditionality and solitariness at the time of the sighting, she also mentioned that she had worked extremely hard during the previous day, promoting her daughter to such guests as photo taking early, which she did. Finally, the soft fluidic floating motion of the object in question and the failure of one or all of the passing cars to stop and/or report the event

which of necessity was viewable to the cars' passengers, seems to this
investigator, ILLUSORY. Considering further that her husband's death
occurred a scene (*****) two years before and that his husband's most
certainly was at ******** ******** in question, this investigator, though
listing this event as "unidentified", tends to discredit this sighting
as a possible illusion.

Cons By-Chairman Raymond Fowler

I have already commented on the reasons why perhaps no one else reported
the object. As regarding the rest of Salvatore's theory, there is no
"certain" that he was highly subjective and improbable in light of all the
Any reasoning to explain the object and the associated noise due to an
illusion brought on by personal grievance for a husband who died 2 years
ago is at the best highly subjective and improbable in light of all the
reported facts. It is possible but highly improbable.

CHAIRMAN'S EVALUATION

The overall factors associated with this sighting and the fact
that it took place (unknown to the witness) within the time-
frame of a local concentration of UFO sightings in Eastern
Massachusetts, prompt me to place this sighting in the "unknown"
category.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The witness got up to relieve herself and looked out the window. She saw a round grayish object carrying a flashing red light on its underside hovering beyond trees which were 1500 feet away (estimated). She called to her husband to come and look at it but he did not want to be disturbed. After watching it for a few minutes, the object dropped straight down behind the trees very slowly. A minute later it descended straight up and hovered again. It then sped away into the North at a fast speed.

SKETCH OF REPORT

[Handwritten note with arrows pointing to sketch: "Round Grayish Object", "Flashing Red Light on Bottom"]

The only conventional explanation would be a helicopter. The only helicopter which normally flies in this area is the U.S.G.S. However, their craft was not airborne that morning.

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in the Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained by writing to Environmental Science Services Administration, PD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map and analysis for 7:00 a.m./c.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from these station reports that cannot be included due to lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperatures at 500-millibars (about 18,000 ft.) at 7:00 a.m./c.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines and are labeled in feet above sea level. The dashed lines, called isotherms, are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m./c.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 8:00 a.m. Amounts in inches are shown to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The rest of the document appears to be a weather map with various contour lines, pressure systems, and meteorological notations, but the specific text on these elements is not clearly legible enough to transcribe with certainty.


- page 64 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

TOP LEFT PANEL:
- "LOW"
- "HIGH"

BOTTOM LEFT PANEL:
- "LOW"
- "HIGH"
- "U.S. SURFACE HEART CONTOURS"

The rest of the text appears to be too small or blurry to confidently transcribe. The page appears to contain several meteorological or topographical charts/maps with contour lines and what seems to be a geographic distribution map on the right side.

TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1968

The rest of the text is mostly illegible or appears to be part of a complex meteorological or geographical map with contour lines, annotations, and various markings. The only clearly legible text is the date at the top of the page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There is no readable text on this page. The image appears to be a series of meteorological or atmospheric charts/maps with contour lines, pressure systems marked as "LOW" and "HIGH", and what seem to be data point distributions. The charts are in black and white and appear to be from a scientific or meteorological report.

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 1968

The rest of the text is too small or illegible to read clearly. The image appears to be a meteorological or topographical map with contour lines, curved lines, and small dot-like markings across the map surface. There are two sections of the map - a larger top section and a smaller bottom section with different line patterns.


- page 69 -

The text I can clearly read on this page is:

HIGH

At the bottom of the contour map section, there is a small text label that appears to say "METEOROLOGICAL CONTOURS" but it is partially cut off and somewhat illegible.

The image appears to be a meteorological or topographical map with contour lines and some scattered notation points, but the text is minimal.

THURSDAY, APRIL 25, 1968

The rest of the text is mostly illegible or part of technical diagrams and weather maps. The document appears to be a weather chart or meteorological document with various lines, contours, and markings indicating atmospheric conditions.


- page 71 -

The text I can clearly read on this document includes:

"LOW"
"HIGH"

The document appears to be a meteorological or topographical map with contour lines and some annotations. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read definitively. The image contains multiple sections with different types of lines and markings, including what seems to be a weather or atmospheric map in the lower left quadrant with curved contour lines.

FRIDAY, APRIL 26, 1968

The rest of the text is mostly illegible or appears to be part of a map or chart with various lines, contours, and markings. The document seems to be a meteorological or geographical chart with annotations like "HIGH" and "LOW" visible.


- page 73 -

The text on this page is mostly illegible. The document appears to contain topographical or meteorological maps with contour lines, grid patterns, and some scattered text that is too blurry to read clearly. There are curved lines, concentric shapes, and what seem to be geographical or data visualization elements, but no clear, readable text can be discerned from this image.

There is no readable text on this page. The image contains several meteorological or geographical charts/maps with contour lines, labeled "HIGH" and "LOW" in various locations, and what appears to be a map of the United States with scattered numerical annotations. The charts seem to be related to weather patterns or topographical information.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS APRIL 29-MAY 5, 1968
WEEKLY SERIES

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Height and Vorticity Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map, an explanatory sheet is available, and may be obtained by writing to: Environmental Services Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Silver Spring, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents the analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the reports that cannot be included in the analysis may be due to space limitations.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. This chart is drawn and analyzed, and the isotherms and wind direction are shown at this level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

SURFACE WEATHER MAP
AND STATION WEATHER
AT 7:00 A.M. E.S.T.

The rest of the text is part of the map labels and weather notations which are too small and blurry to reliably transcribe completely. The image appears to be a detailed weather map showing atmospheric pressure systems, weather stations, and meteorological data across a geographic region.

Surface Weather Map
and Station Weather
at 7:00 A.M. EST

500 MILLIBAR HEIGHT CONTOURS
AT 7:00 A.M. EST

The image contains multiple meteorological maps showing weather patterns, including surface weather maps, 500 millibar height contours, and what appears to be a weather station map and a map with scattered data points.


- page 83 -

TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1968

[The rest of the text is part of the weather map and is mostly illegible due to the small print and image quality. The document appears to be a weather map with various lines, contours, and markings indicating weather patterns and conditions across a geographic region.]


- page 84 -

The image appears to be a weather map with multiple panels showing different meteorological data:

Top panel: Appears to be a weather station map with "LOW" and "HIGH" markings

Middle panel: Shows contour lines, possibly representing atmospheric pressure or elevation, with curved and wavy lines

Bottom right panel: Shows a map of the United States with various markings and data points

Bottom left panel: Shows "500-MILLIBAR HEIGHT CONTOURS AT 7:00 A.M. EST"

The text on the image is mostly technical and related to meteorological data and mapping. The image seems to be from a weather report or analysis document.

WEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 1968

[The rest of the text is part of the weather map and is mostly illegible due to the small size and low resolution of the image. The map appears to show various weather patterns with curved lines, some labeled "LOW" and "HIGH", and scattered small markings across the map.]


- page 86 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

"200 MILLIBAR HEIGHT CONTOURS"
"HIGH"
"LOW"

The document appears to be a meteorological map with various contour lines, height measurements, and weather-related data points. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read completely. The page contains multiple maps or charts showing different meteorological data visualizations.


- page 87 -

Text found in the document:

THURSDAY, MAY 2, 1968

[The rest of the text appears to be part of weather maps and charts with labels like "HIGH", "LOW", and various meteorological symbols and lines, but the specific text is too small or blurry to read clearly.]


- page 88 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

- page 89 -

The text I can discern on this document includes:

At the bottom of a contour map section:
"500-MB HEIGHT CONTOURS
AT 700 + 24 TEST"

The image appears to be a series of meteorological charts and maps, including what look like weather contour maps, atmospheric pressure maps, and data point charts. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly.

FRIDAY, MAY 3, 1968

[The rest of the text appears to be part of a meteorological map with various contour lines, annotations of "HIGH" and "LOW", and what seems to be weather data points. However, most of the specific text is too small or blurry to read with complete certainty.]


- page 91 -

The text I can discern on this page is:

LOW

NATIONAL WEATHER RECORDS CENTER

SURFACE WEIGHT CONTOUR
SCALE 1:25 M

The image appears to be a meteorological chart with contour lines, weather symbols, and what looks like a map or weather pattern visualization.


- page 92 -

SATURDAY, MAY 4, 1968

The rest of the text appears to be numbers and labels on what seems to be a meteorological or atmospheric pressure map, with contour lines and various numerical annotations. The words "HIGH" and "LOW" are visible in different areas of the map. Due to the density of small numbers and markings, I cannot reliably transcribe all of them without potentially introducing errors.


- page 93 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

"LOW"

"WILLIAM WEIGHT CONTOUR"

The rest of the document appears to be various topographical or meteorological maps/charts with contour lines and scattered numerical notations, but the specific text is too small or blurry to reliably transcribe.


- page 94 -

SUNDAY, MAY 5, 1968

[The rest of the text is too small or illegible to accurately transcribe. The image appears to be a topographical or meteorological map with contour lines, various markings, and what seem to be data points scattered across the map. There are three sections to the image: a large main map, and two smaller maps or charts at the bottom of the page.]


- page 95 -

There is no readable text on this page. The image contains several maps or charts with contour lines, geographical outlines, and what appear to be meteorological or topographical diagrams. The bottom of the page has a horizontal line, but no text is visible.
