THE FOLLOWING IS A RESUME OF A REPORT ON A UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OBSERVED OVER TWIN FALLS, IDAHO, ON 7 JULY 1965.

1. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS MST. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS HAVING LUMINOUS, WHITE-LIKE LIGHTS, AND APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A LARGE STAR. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE A VERTICAL ASCENT AND DESCENT, HOVERING AT TIMES.

2. AT ONE POINT, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO STAND STILL MOMENTARILY AND THEN ZOOM AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT THEN REAPPEARED IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AND REPEATED THE MANEUVER.

3. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL WITNESSES FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES. IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AT APPROXIMATELY 2145 HOURS MST.

4. AIR DEFENSE COMMAND HAS ADVISED THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT DETECTED ON RADAR.

METEOROLOGIST'S REVIEW:
1. THE WITNESSES DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS HAVING A LUMINOUS, WHITE-LIKE APPEARANCE AND AS APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A LARGE STAR.
2. IT EXHIBITED VERTICAL ASCENT AND DESCENT, HOVERING, AND HIGH SPEED MANEUVERS.
3. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES.
4. IT WAS NOT DETECTED ON RADAR.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a UFO sighting report.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

THE VISUAL OBSERVATION DURATION WAS ALMOST INDEFINITE AS AT THE BATTLE AREA WAS VERY DARK AND MANY STARS WERE VISIBLE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND EMITTING A HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHT ON THE OBJECT ITSELF. WITNESS REPORTED THAT BUDDY AIR CREW MEMBERS FROM ANOTHER AIRCRAFT ALSO OBSERVED AND REPORTED IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO GET ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OR IDENTIFICATION DETAILS WHILE AIRBORNE. DATA OTHER THAN THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION WAS REPORTED WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO VERIFY. THE CONDITION OF NIGHT VISION CAPABILITY WHICH WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THIS PARTICULAR OBSERVATION WOULD INDICATE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED UNLESS OTHER "UFO" SIGHTINGS ARE REPORTED.
