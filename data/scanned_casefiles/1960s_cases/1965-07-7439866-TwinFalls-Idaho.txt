FIELD NOTES & UNCLE

WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING MY VISIT WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL AS AT THE LIGHTING MILE. THE AREA WAS VERY DARK AND MANY STARS WERE VISIBLE.

AS THE ONLY WAY I OBSERVED NO SHOOTING STARS OR ANYTHING ELSE.

I EXPLORED THE SIGHTING. NO EXTRA CLUES WERE COLLECTED IN THE AREA DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. I'M REPORTED IT WAS 150 FEET FOR AN AFT PLANE. AND THE OBJECTS WERE NOT METEORS AS BOTH WERE SEEN JUST BEFORE.

JOINT MOVE ARE WEATHER DOES NOT REPORT ANY METEOROLOGICAL DATA FROM THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS OCCURRENCE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT APPEARS BEYOND BLUE BOOK CAPABILITIES. THIS CONCLUDES MY INVESTIGATION UNLESS OTHER WISE DIRECTED.
