11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers for three straight nights watched 7 star like objects in various parts of the sky. The objects had no discernible shape; just appearing as distant lights. The color of the objects was white with pulsating, red and green lights. There was no discernible flight path noted or any type of noise. The objects were still visible when the last observer went to bed at approximately 2330 local.

Investigating official at McDill AFB felt that the observers actually saw only stars which appeared to change colors. The different colors were caused by the prismatic effect of the earth's atmosphere. A Dr. Heinrich Eichhorn, chairman of the University of South Florida's astronomy department was contacted and he described the phenomenon as irregular atmospheric dispersion.
