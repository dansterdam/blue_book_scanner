Bright yellow balls of light. Brighter than stars and a lot closer. Faded away to the last. Object as bright as the moon. Three lights appeared in same relative position to each other. Appeared in North and disappeared in East. Speed constant 310 deg in flight path, but direction remained the same.

It was a bright night, yet the moon was only 0.2d illuminated as viewed from the earth and it was low on the horizon. No evidence that would indicate this was not misidentification of an a/c.
