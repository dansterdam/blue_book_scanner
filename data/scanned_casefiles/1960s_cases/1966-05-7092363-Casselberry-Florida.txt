The image provided appears to contain a diagram or sketch, but does not contain any photographs. The diagram shows a view from the rear of a police department, looking west, with annotations indicating the location of a Casselberry Utilities water tower and a strong light, as well as a description of the movement of an observed "control" star.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

VIEW AS SEEN FROM REAR OF POLICE DEPARTMENT (LOOKING WEST)
1st Pos (Vectored) Approx. 8:15 PM Strong Light
X - At this point the "Object" appeared to get weaker in
intensity - as the moving, or having moved away from
our position (approx 8:30 PM)
REAR OF CASSELBERRY PLAZA BUILDINGS
Movement of "control" star may have varied slightly one way or the other but was nearly unnoticeable relative
to our #1 vector.
Method of an approximate direction of vectors (Forest City is approx. West of our vantage point.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. It depicts a grid-like coordinate system, with a utility water tower labeled "Casselberry Utilities Water Tower" and a "Strong Light" object at a specific location. The diagram also includes annotations describing the movement or behavior of the object, such as "Object appeared to get weaker in intensity - as if too moving, or having moved away from our position (approx. 8:30 p.m.)." There is also a mention of the "Movement of 'Cosmic' star," which may have varied slightly from the object.

The image does not contain any human faces or identifiable individuals.
