Transcription of the text in the document:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Sir:

This is in reference to your letter of 11 September 1960, concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object sighted in Lincoln Park, Michigan on 8 September 1960.

Congratulations. The information obtained from your sighting provides additional confirmation for the existence of unidentified flying objects. Thousands of reports on file at the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, indicate that this phenomenon is real and not just figments of the imagination.

As you requested, the original report of your sighting is enclosed. The incident has been classified as "unexplained" and this designation will remain on the permanent file. We do not believe the weight of scientific evidence on hand conclusively proves the existence of interplanetary spaceships visiting this earth. However, the Air Force is continuing its investigation of the problem.

Sincerely,

/s/
