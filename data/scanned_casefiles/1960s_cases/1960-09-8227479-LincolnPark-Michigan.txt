I was watching the sky for echo, but I observed this object 'saucer' and noted the strange light. Blue and white also watched and adjusted my eyesight to it and it moved slightly to left and later right at same level very fast, then up with light exhaust light (electron beam) shooting below. Take a flashlight and aim in a fog same results.

So as I will always believe it was a saucer described in The Bible due to its parting and then coming together. It was also brighter than echo. We have some clouds and a snow searchlight was turning off but in the space that it was clear I could see the motions of it and having myself against home I took some pictures.

Very nice for picture taking using different exposure etc.

Dear Mrs.

I watched a so called star tonight that caught my attention before dark. at times it seemed to move in West N.W. sky. When again it seemed to rest with a red and blue light inbetween. also seemed at times to shoot a white stream like a night jet or jets exhaust streamer.

I took some pictures with my kodak easy 35 setting inf. also between 6 and 25 from or- or lens from 36-21 then shot another 6 miles shoots other setting at 16. 25- 00.

sincerely,

Just a goofy production at Ford they launch at a car with no real gum and just turned down side lights that we up 6 1010 w bulbs can light a foot ball field with 6.000 watts instead of 96.000.
