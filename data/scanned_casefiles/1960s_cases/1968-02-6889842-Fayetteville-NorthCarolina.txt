                                                     Day     Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. AT THE FIRST SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET FROM THE OBSERVER. THE OBJECT WAS HOVERING DOWN. MOST OF THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE THROUGH THE LEFT DOOR WINDOW OPENING.

THE OBJECT, AFTER THREE OR FOUR MINUTES OF OBSERVATION BECAME A FLICKERING, RED LIGHT AND REMAINED STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MINUTES. IT THEN BECAME A BRIGHT LIGHT, AS WHEN FIRST OBSERVED, THE APPROXIMATELY ONE TO ONE-HALF SECONDS. THEN AGAIN BECAME A FLICKERING RED LIGHT.

APPROXIMATELY TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS LATER IT WAS JOINED BY ANOTHER FLICKERING RED LIGHT. THE TWO LIGHTS REMAINED TOGETHER APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE. THE SECOND RED LIGHT MOVED OFF TO A NW DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED. SEVERAL SECONDS LATER, THE FIRST OBJECT AS A FLICKERING RED LIGHT BEGAN MOVING CASE BEGINNING A BRIGHT LIGHT AGAIN THEN SLOWLY CHANGING TO A FLICKERING RED LIGHT AND THEN MOVING. OBSERVATION WAS TRACKING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, THEN DISAPPEARED.

APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES PRIOR TO BOTH OBJECTS DISAPPEARING, FIFTH LEVEL OF THE WOMAN HAD COME FROM THE BASE BLDG ONTO THE MR. AREA AND TOLD HIM OF WHAT WAS SEEN. AFTER THE WOMEN LEFT, I APOLOGIZED A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO ME. THEN HE RELATED WHAT WAS JUST OBSERVED. HE RELATED I WAS TALKING AGAIN. I TURNED TO THE DIRECTION HE WAS POINTING TO AND OBSERVED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT RETURNING FROM THE WEST UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED THE RED LIGHT. THE TWO LIGHTS CONTINUED FIRST BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT AND FIRST RED FLICKERING LIGHT. AFTER REMAINING THOSE SEVERAL MINUTES THE FLICKERING RED LIGHT WENT NEAR FIRST GOING NORTH. SEVERAL SECONDS LATER THE WHITE LIGHT CAME TO N.E. AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED GIVING IT THE APPEARANCE OF GOING AND I WENT TO THE BASE BLDG. I THEN SPOKE WITH MR. SINCE, AND DID NOT UNTIL 22-9-68, FIND OUT WHAT HIS NAME WAS.

IT IS MERELY THE REASON FOR THIS REPORT BEING RETURNED AS LATE AS IT IS.

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. In accordance with AFR 80-17 the attached report is forwarded to your organization for appropriate action.

2. Due to the proximity of several airfields in the area of this sighting (including Grannis Municipal Airfield, Simmons Army Airfield, and Pope AFB) I believe the UFO reported can be attributed to small aircraft or helicopter lights.
