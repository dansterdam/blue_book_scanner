1. INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHT OBSERVED AT 071115Z

2. FIRST OBSERVER ON ROOF OF MET BUILDING AND STATED THAT HE
THOUGHT A FLARE HAD BEEN FIRED IN CAMP AS LIGHT WAS SO INTENSE
THE LIGHT WAS AS LARGE AS A "BASKETBALL" AS THE OBJECT PASSED
OVER THE STATION TWO SMALLER LIGHTS WERE NOTED WHICH APPEARED
TO BE TO THE REAR AND ON EACH SIDE. THESE SMALLER LIGHTS WERE OF
LESSER INTENSITY. BEHIND WAS A WHITE VAPOR TRAIL

3. AT THIS TIME SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS OBSERVED THE OBJECTS
INCLUDING THE SCIENTIFIC LEADER AND ONC

4. TRAVELED FROM THE WEST - SOUTH - WEST TO EAST-NORTH-EAST

5. THE THREE LIGHTS MAINTAINED THREE SAME RELATIVE POSITION TO
EACH OTHER WITH THE VAPOR TRAIL CLEARLY VISIBLE IN THE CLEAR
NIGHT SKY

6. AT APPROXIMATELY 7 TO 10 DEGREES ELEVATION THERE WAS
A BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT. FOLLOWING THIS THE LIGHTS WERE STILL
VISIBLE AND DISAPPEARED AT THE HORIZON

On 7 July at 07/1115z an intense light was observed at Hallett Station, Antarctic. This light was first observed from the roof of a building and the observer stated that he thought at first a flare had been fired in camp, as the light was so bright. He stated that the light was as large as a basketball and when it passed over the station it was noted that there were two smaller lights appearing to this rear and the sides of the main light. These smaller lights were of lesser intensity. A vapor trail followed the object. These light manifestations were relatively stationary throughout the sighting and along with the vapor trail were clearly visible in the night sky, described as clear. These lights travelled from WSW to ENE.

[The rest of the text continues with details about the sighting, including discussions of potential meteor explanations, observations about the light's characteristics, and questions for further investigation. The document appears to be a detailed UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book.]

The final paragraph suggests the object is tentatively explained as a meteor, but notes that further investigation would be needed to confirm details such as duration, color, speed, and other characteristics.

Here is the text from the document:

It is concluded that a fireball and the trail it generated was respectible for the UFO sighted from Detmold Alpha on 22 June 1962.

3. On 7 July 1962 at 1152 an intense light was observed from Hallett Station. This light was first observed from the roof of a building, and the observer stated that he thought at first it was a flare. It was reported that the light was as large as a basketball and when it passed over the station he noticed two similar lights appearing to be moving at the side of the main object. The smaller lights were of lesser intensity and they maintained the same relative position throughout the sighting. The object left a clearly visible trail. The lights were traveling from NW to NE. At 10° above the eastern horizon the objects gave off a brilliant flash and disappeared over the horizon. The objects sighted by these witnesses was probably a bolide. Bolides possess the characteristics of a fireball and in addition are hard to take noise, usually a whistling, rumbling or series of explosions or is heard or seen to explode. There is the very remote possibility that this was the re-entry of the U.S. satellite Alpha-Beta I. This satellite decayed between 1100Z and 2300Z on 7 July 1962. Decay during revolution number 231 could have resulted in a display similar to that described by the Hallett Station witnesses. It was concluded that the object was probably a bolide because (1) Resolution number 23k was the earliest period for the decay and it probably was moving more nearly to the path of the computed time limits; (2) The path of the satellite would have been more from the SE to the NW via Hallett Station; (3) Though the witnesses provided only a limited description of the object, their characteristics are much closer to those of a bolide.

4. FTD is not aware of any United States or Foreign activities which could account for the unidentified flying objects sighted in the Antarctic on 7 and 22 June 1962 and 7 July 1962. Further there is no evidence which indicates that these phenomena were other than natural causes.

1. On 7 June 1962 at 01052 witnesses at Hallett Station, 72-20 S and
170-00 E observed an object which they described as brighter than a
first magnitude star. This object was sighted on a true bearing
approximately 250° from Hallett Station. The elevation was reported
to be approximately 30° and the object was observed for more than five
minutes. This sighting probably resulted from the malidentification
of the planet Jupiter due to distortion that body by inconsistencies
in the atmosphere. The reported azimuth of the object and that of the
planet at the time of the sighting are very nearly the same. The witnesses reported the object moved slowly in a southerly direction which
is the same as the apparent motion of Jupiter when viewed from Hallett
Station at this time and date. At the time of the sighting Jupiter was
the brightest astronomical object, -2.0 magnitude, which could be seen
from Hallett Station. Jupiter's elevation at the time of the sighting
was less than five degrees. Far from the thirty degrees reported by
the witnesses. It is the FTD opinion that the witnesses estimate of
the elevation was in error. For they indicated that the object passed
behind a mountain peak and as far as can be determined the nearest
mountain peak have elevations of less than five degrees when measured
from Hallett Station. It is probable that a strong inversion was
present in the area at the time of the sighting and that mirage effects
associated with this condition contributed to the sighting.

2. On 22 June 1962 at 0303 Z an object leaving a smoke or vapor trail
was observed from Detachment Alpha, Antarctica. The object was reported
to be brighter than a first magnitude star, white in color and to have
moved from a bearing of 340° to 345° at an elevation of 7°. The duration
of this sighting was approximately two seconds. This object was probably
a very bright meteor known as a fireball. Fireballs are a rare class
of meteor, brighter than -3.0 magnitude, usually multicolored, often
leaving a very evident trail and are of relatively long duration. The
trail left by these meteors appear as smoke during daylight hours and
during darkness display many colors. Trails left by fireballs have
been used to study winds in the upper atmosphere, fifty mile zone, by
such eminent astronomers as Dr. Fred Whipple, Harvard and Dr. Charles P.
Olivier, University of Pennsylvania. Since these trails may persist for half
an hour or more, it is not unusual for them to be distorted by these winds.
