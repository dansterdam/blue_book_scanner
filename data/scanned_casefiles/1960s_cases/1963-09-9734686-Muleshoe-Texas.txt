AN AIRCRAFT OF THE MULESHOE FLYING SERVICE DISPATCHED BY THE BAILEY COUNTY, TEXAS, DID COMMENCE AND SEARCH RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE.

(2) WERE SIGHTED IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION
(3) MOVED FROM THE OBSERVER'S LEFT TO HIS RIGHT 
(4) MADE NO SOUND.
THESE FOUR SIMILARITIES SEEN TO INDICATE THAT ALL FIVE SIGHTINGS WERE PROBABLY RELATED.

9. Clouding whitish, described as white streak with tail 1 x  length of object. Sighting at sunrise. Appearance like exploded star.
9. Striking metallic splitting into two objects. Bright spot at center with slight whiles corners. Trail or 12-15 second duration. Disappeared over horizon in 3-4 sec.
9. Luminous streak remaining visible for a few seconds. From time to time and direction unknown, some shine with SIIIAE sudden out bouncing like exploded to be as bright as its.

The text in the document is as follows:

"AF IN 21939 (4 OCT 63) PASS FOUR RUSSIAN SA UNUSUAL R-S WERE OBSERVING THE SAME PHENOMENON. THAT THEY UFO WAS JUDGED TO BE ANYWHERE FROM 100 YARDS TO 55 MILES AWAY MAY HAVE BEEN ANY VISUAL RESPONSE DUE TO CONSIDER TO DISTANCE AS WELL AS THE TENDENCY OF THE UNTRAINED EYE TO DISBELIE OBJECT WHICH IS CLEARLY IN VIEW COULD POSSIBLE BE MORE VALUABLE OR HALLOS WHICH MAY HAVE SUCH OBSERVED. INDIVIDUALS WHO DID OCCUR THE SIGHTING AS AN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON OCCURING MANY HILLS WERE ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH SCIENTIFIC AND FLYING BACKGROUND EXPERIENCED IN OBSERVING UNUSUAL OVER GREAT DISTANCES A MEXICAN FARM WORKER BELIEVED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT CRASHING 5 MILES AWAY WAS MOST PROBABLY LARGE METEOR DISAPPEARING IN A CURVE OF THE EARTH MANY DISTANCE AWAY. THE INDICATOR OF THE GREAT DISTANCE INVOLVED WAS THE FACT THAT NO OBSERVERS HEARD ANY SOUND. IF AN AIRPLANE EXPLODED AND 55 MILES AWAY, OR AN OBJECT EXPLODED OVER A 2.5 MILE AWAY, THERE WOULD HAVE SURELY BEEN A SOUND".
