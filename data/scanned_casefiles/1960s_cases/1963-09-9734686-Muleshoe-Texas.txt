9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two shiny silver objs w/long bright flaming trail behind. Disappeared over horizon at 225 deg azimuth after flight from 15 deg elevation 150 deg. Ground observer driving tractor. Flight decreased sharply and obj appeared to explode. Additional observer described obj as flaring white. 3 - 10 seconds.

10. COMMENTS
Obj with same description at 45 deg elev 210 deg az. Appeared to turn out at 15 deg elev. Smaller obj with same green leveling trail. Assumed nearby at 50 deg angle. One second duration.

Fireworks. Observed at 45 deg elev, 210 deg az. 2 seconds. Fast descending.
Bright white obj with some green leveling trail. 10x size of obj. 35 deg elevation in SW. Heading of obj 315 deg. Curve toward ground. Appeared to burn out leaving smoke trail and wash. Thought to be flare about 50 ft from observer. (over)

SIMULTANEOUSLY INFORMED REESE AFB AND THE SAC CP OF THE CRASH
REPORT. NEITHER C.P.'S WERE MISSING ANY AIRCRAFT. REESE, HOW-
EVER, DISPATCHED HER OWN HELICOPTER TO THE REPORTED CRASH SITE.
THE REPORTED CRASH SITE (UTM COORDS. FM 8592) WAS THOROUGHLY
SEARCHED FROM THE AIR BY THE HELICOPTERS AS WELL AS BY TWO LIGHT
AIRCRAFT OF THE JULESHOE FLYING SERVICE DISPATCHED BY THE SHERIFF OF
BAILEY COUNTY, TEXAS, DEE CLEMENTS. RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. IN

STEPHEN B. CARTER, 1ST LT., ASSISTANT WING INTELLIGENCE
OFFICER, 27TH TFWG. COMMENTS: ALL FIVE OF THE UFO SIGHTINGS IN
THE CANNON AFB AREA ON 30 SEP 63.

(1)    OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 1545Z

(2)    WERE SIGHTED IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION

(3)    MOVED FROM THE OBSERVER'S LEFT TO HIS RIGHT

(4)    MADE NO SOUND.

THESE FOUR SIMILARITIES SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALL FIVE OBSERVERS

5. Glowing whitebod described as white streak with tail 5X length of obj. 30 deg elevation 245 az. Straight flight exploding. 1 second. Split into two objects as is maneuver.

6. Oblong obj shiny metallic splitting into two objects. Bright spot at end. Orange color with bright white center. Tail or trail 5-6X length of obj. 75 deg elevation 210 deg az. Disappeared over horizon at 0 deg elev 225 az. From SSW to NW. 2-3 sec.

CONCLUSION: Check with SPADES several that there was no hazy for this Date. Also direction toward SW (water) component ruling out Decay. Case evaluated as a meteor sighting. Observation from two state area aids validity to this hypothesis.

WERE OBSERVING THE SAME PHENOMENON. THAT THE UFO WAS JUDGED TO BE ANYWHERE FROM 100 YARDS TO 60 MILES AWAY MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM A LACK OF ANY VISUAL REFERENCES TO COMPARE THE OBJECT WITHIN A CLOUDLESS SKY, AS WELL AS THE TENDENCY OF THE UNTRAINED EYE TO DISBELIEVE THAT AN OBJECT WHICH IS CLEARLY IN VIEW COULD POSSIBLE BE MORE THAN A FEW YARDS OR MILES AWAY. THOSE OBSERVERS WHO DID ACCEPT THE UFO SIGHTING AS AN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON OCCURRING MANY MILES AWAY WERE ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH SCIENTIFIC AND FLYING BACKGROUND, AND EXPERIENCED IN OBSERVING OBJECTS OVER GREAT DISTANCES. WHAT THE MEXICAN FARM WORKER BELIEVED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT CRASHING 5 OR 6 MILES AWAY WAS MOST PROBABLY LARGE METEOR DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE CURVE OF THE EARTH MANY TIMES THAT DISTANCE AWAY. THE BEST INDICATOR OF THE GREAT DISTANCE INVOLVED WAS THE FACT THAT NONE OF THE OBSERVERS HEARD ANY SOUND. IF AN AIRPLANE EXPLODED AND CRASHED 5 OR 6 MILES AWAY, OR AN OBJECT EXPLODED OVER A T.V. ANTENNA 100 YARDS AWAY, THERE WOULD HAVE SURELY BEEN A SOUND.

1. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE HAS BEEN FOUND.
