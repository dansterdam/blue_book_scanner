3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 12 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: N

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Other (ARTIFICIAL CLOUD RELEASE) ✓ Spot

Brief Summary and Analysis:
Observers watched a pale red cloud type object, almost to the point of appearing as a vapor or being transparent, appeared in the northern sky. The object was stationary except it was getting larger. Object was compared to a red translucent cloud with no apparent motion. Object was witnessed by the observer at the Anderson Falls Weather Bureau.

A cloud release over Fort Churchill at an altitude of approx 100 miles would have been visible for up to about 900 miles. A 1/16-Apache rocket was launched at 01352 and the cloud release occurred shortly after.

Dear Mr.

After investigating your most unusual observation in the northern sky 13 September 1966, I felt you might be interested to learn of Project Blue Book's findings.

Having considered the available information and having reference to the recent upper atmospheric research studies at Fort Churchill, Canada, contact was made with a Mr. Mc Bay of Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. Conversation with Mr. McBay provided the following information:

"At 0135Z, 14 September 1966, there was a Nike-Apache rocket launched from Fort Churchill. The rocket reached an altitude of approximately 102 statute miles before releasing a cloud that would have been visible for up to 900 miles from the Fort Churchill area. The objective of these cloud releases is to obtain measurements of electric fields and wind motion in the upper atmosphere by photographing and tracking the movement of the ionized clouds."

Although there were several different cloud releases during a two day period, I feel that this launch at 0135Z was the culprit in your observation. These cloud releases are a truly fascinating phenomena to observe as I am sure you will attest.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

At the time of observation, about six hours after a cold frontal passage, the weather was broken cirrus clouds or 6/10 sky coverage of 4th ch 3/10 were opaque. All clouds were in the southern half of the sky. Visibility was more than one mile.

This phenomenon was also witnessed by the observer at the International Falls weather bureau, International Falls, Minnesota. Also looking North.

Gentlemen,

Rather than filling out another PTD form, I will just add this concurring note to the form Mr. Woodward has completed.

My observation was at the same location and time, as described in the phenomena almost exactly as I saw it. I am certain it was not a "Flying Saucer", however, it was a rather strange phenomenon.
