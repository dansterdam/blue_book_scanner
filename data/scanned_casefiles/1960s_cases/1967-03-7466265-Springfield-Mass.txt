Dear Mr.,

The enclosed report relates to a confidential incident type of
"avid cloak" case in an undisclosed location. The report is something you may wish to forward with the remark that you pass it on to the proper office.

Because we are in Dakar, where videotaped records of a report like this would be self-authenticating, it is easily to tell that a useful in classifying the report locally until if our people back home check it out. The ambassador, who asked me to use the only means we have of its evidence.

I want about the old case. Most of these are close personal contacts with the U.S. Military Attaché in a nearby consulate with the All Africa Conference in Karuma. Both are well acquainted, stable persons, and I have no doubt that they can vouch for the story. I might never that the incident took place on or about March 28, and tell as of this residence. We had a stay in Karuma, and the close year. I will want to be sure to look at witnesses. They felt it should be reported to some official agency, I warn, who came to us in the civil air action.

I was arriving from the Kariba lake on the air/car to an all-news card, we know that I from a close source, other care on this road. They said they neglected only one car passing then during this period, will be correct ink we on getting so far from a road. While in this area, most go like to work on it if they saw it. Most go to bed at darkness. We did not make a suggestion I did not the fact African meteorological or technical or I might say their they were in the area of March 18. No activity on the evening of March 18. The answer was negative.

Although the enclosed data log is on the letterhead of Gregory, each of the family (name redacted) are pictured, independently, and the results were possible, they were acting in the wild acting near some of the objects given to be lit in the white was clear and is possible this report is accurate.

I have not heard of any other UFOs being reported in action. In that have been, two local worthwhile officials in the field, two locals said they would be willing to speak to official questioning, but wish to avoid local publicity for personal and professional reasons.

RE: OUR UFO FILES

On the night of Saturday, March 18, 1967, we were returning to Patrol Frs. Kigwe. We left Kigwe about 5:20 p.m. and were driving along, up to about 50 miles an hour, by a plane with all its cabin lights on!" I glanced ahead and to the right and got a glimpse of what I thought was the fuselage about the size of a boxcar.

Friendishly disappearing just out of vision beyond the hillside. The windows unusually large. It appeared to be just above the level of the trees. My husband said, "If it's that low it will surely crash," and as we went up the hill we were all listening, but heard nothing.

Two or three minutes later we got another glimpse on the right over the valley, and as soon as the lights of the TV tower were in sight, we could see this object again in front of us and slightly to the right. As my husband was driving, this was the first clear view he got. "As we saw that appeared to be a row of lights coming from the windows, fairly clearly separated. The object was moving forward in front of us and perhaps a mile to the right (south) on the highway. At about this time our daughter, Ruth, 9, got her first glimpse of the object as she was sitting in the middle of the front seat and did not have a very good view. She became very frightened, and continued to be more and more so the rest of the way home. Gregory, on the other hand, was absolutely fascinated and saw more than any of the rest of us, as he had an unobstructed view. My husband, driving and I, confusing Ruth's somewhat less than he did although I saw the object most of the times Gregory said he could see it.

As we drove on we kept having glimpses of the object whenever there were no trees to obstruct the view. Sometimes we could see only part of it. Ruth became more and more agitated, and as we came near Kixyu I said that perhaps 15 was a lights in the direction of Alliance High School or the lighted verandah of a house on a hill, in order to calm her. However, since we had seen it from time to time since arriving at the top of the escarpment, this could not have been the case.

As we passed the road to Kixyu we could see the object very clearly, as we had caught up with it and it was now directly on our right. But now we could see two objects very distinctly. The one on the right was larger, and apparently was the one we had been seeing. The one on the left was smaller, one-third to one-half the size of the larger one. Because they appeared to be closer at this point we could quite clearly make out both the fore and after parts of the objects red lights which were slightly extended and above the objects. Both were slightly inclined at an angle of about ten to twelve degrees from the ground, the lower side in the direction in which they were moving.

We observed them wherever there were no trees between us for a few miles. Just after we passed the Zambezi Hotel we saw them very clearly in a field to the right. They seemed to be hovering over one spot, no more than 50 to 100 feet above the ground. We did not feel that we were being observed but rather that we had come upon them by chance. Gregory was very curious; I was somewhat frightened but curious enough that I would have got out of the car, but Ruth became almost hysterical and we decided we had better drive on, since we had stopped the car for more careful observation.

It is impossible to say whether we were observing a round object from the side or a cigar-shaped object, except that we saw the row of lights very much the same when it was in front of us, to the side, and behind us. In all had the impression of looking at the side of a disc with two red lights on either end (that is, fore and aft). Gregory said he saw them as discs and could barely see in outline above the lighted windows a curvature somewhat similar to what one sees when observing a quarter-moon in a clear sky.

The lights did not flicker or fluctuate; there was no light observable above or below the objects. None of the lights changed color while we observed them, nor was there any impression of anything spinning. The objects did not appear at

anytime to be actually resting on the ground, but did appear most of the time to be "floating" below the level of the treetops. At no time did we hear any sound at all.

We continued to observe the objects until we got to Kabete and turned off to the left on Solate's Road. They seemed to have slowed down and were behind us, off to the right veering to the right when we turned off. Again, they were very low and following more or less the valley and much of the time were partly obscured by trees.

After we turned towards Westlands we did not expect to see them again, as the cool follows a ridge and they had seemed to be starting down the valley out of our line of sight. There are also a great many tall trees as one approaches the old Nairobi city limits (30 mph zone). However, to our surprise, just as we passed the main entrance to the Nairobi School we saw both objects, coming as they the ridge that Churchill Avenue follows and coming into the valley above St. Austin's Road. They were rising slowly, and we could see them until we got to the ABC parking area we would have been no more than possibly a half to three-quarters of a mile from than at most. At this distance a larger object looked as if it might be the size of the fuselage of a DC-8 or larger. They were rising out of the valley together, still inclined slightly towards the direction in which they were moving. They were rising at about the speed and angle of a large helicopter but at no time was there any noise whatsoever or change in the appearance of the lights. Again there was feeling of "floating" effortlessly.

About three minutes later we were at our house. I looked at my watch and it was 10:15 p.m. We looked up into the sky but saw no sign of anything unusual. There were few or no clouds in the sky, and the quarter-moon was clear.

We have recently been especially interested in UFOs, as a friend of ours had seen a formation of them cross the sky in Brazil in November. We had, in fact, mentioned that very evening that we had never heard of a sighting in Africa, and surely not in East Africa. All four of us, however, clearly saw these objects over a period of approximately 30 minutes, and over a distance of more than 20 miles. At one stopped at our daughter is still very upset about the whole thing we have not discussed what we saw any further in front of her except to reassure her that UFOs have never been known to harm anyone. Gregory H. T. and I, however, agree that this is an accurate account of what we saw. Gregory encloses a picture of what we saw and all agree that this is very nearly correct.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 APRIL 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the Questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The reason I did not stop was that I was going to work and I was driving a different route and was unfamiliar with the area so did not question the observation until I returned the same route later that day. To further this is nothing else, but field. What most impressed me at the time was the flat brilliance of the windows - I wondered at first while they were pouring steel (red glow) but it if 20 windows would vary in brilliance - After thinking about it for 3 days and I finally arrive at this positive conclusion and tell my wife.

Dear [redacted]

Referring your recent letter addressed to 1st Lt. Marley and SSgt Jones at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Essentially, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data, such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data.

The enclosed information on the Air Force's program concerning UFOs should be of interest to you.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MERLE E. YOUNG

Chief, Civil Branch

Dear Sgt. Jones,

My name is [REDACTED] I am 13 years old; I am a student at George Dewey Junior High School, Bremerton, Washington. I have quite an interest in UFOs. I would like to make sort of a study on UFOs. I am writing because I would like you to send me some pictures or information of some kind on UFOs. You probably are busy but if you could find time to do this I would appreciate it very much.

I will tell about my experience with a UFO. One night about 9:45 about March 20, 1967 my friend and I were looking out of my telescope at a star in the West. I was about to go in and get a higher powered lense then I looked to the East and saw some kind of object. I called my friends attention to the object. Both of us were scared. It made no noise that we could here but my dog stared in the area of the object and started to whimper and bark.

The object was illuminated but we could still see the outline of the object. It zig-zagged and seemed to take sharp turns. It traveled at about 5 or 600 miles per hour. It hovered over a tree for about 15 seconds then shot up and disappeared. I wanted to call the police or the nearest A.F.B. but my mother wouldn't let me. Thats the story.

Yours truly,
[REDACTED]

On 22 March 1967 the crew of a Brazilian Air Force C-47 and the crew of a Cruzeiro do Sul photographic aircraft reported having seen a flying saucer in the vicinity of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. The object was initially sighted by the "PV" crew who described it as a reddish colored full moon that appeared to be lying in circles. The C-47 advised Salgado Filho Tower or the sighting and the tower asked the crew to identify the object.

The Cruzeiro do Sul aircraft attempted to intercept and contact with the object and pursued it for 15 minutes, before it finally disappeared. No pictures were taken of the object. In addition to the reported sightings by the aircraft crews, the object was also reportedly seen by ground observers in the Porto Alegre area.

A rare recent sighting occurred on 30 March 1967 in Rio Comprido, however, this one was reported only by ground observers. The object was described as completely white, silent, flying at low altitude, and would disappear and re-appear at regular intervals. This particular sighting received very little publicity in the news media.

COMMENTS: As yet the Air Ministry has not issued any official comment on these sightings and is presently studying the statements of the aircraft crews and ground observers.
