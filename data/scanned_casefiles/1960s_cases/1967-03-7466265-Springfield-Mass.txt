REPORT TO THE UNITED STATES
AIR FORCE
ON THE NIGHT OF SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1967, 8:30 P.M.
KIUKYU, MASS.

ON the night of Saturday, March 4, 1967, about 8:30 p.m., as we were driving along the road through Kiukyu, Mass., we saw what appeared to be a large bright light or object hovering above the top of the trees in the distance. As we came closer to the spot, the object seemed to move slowly to the right, and then suddenly disappeared. A young couple in the car with us said, "Did you see that?" and we all exclaimed that we had.

A glance of the object appeared to be about the size of a basketball. The color was a brilliant white, and it seemed to be illuminating the entire area around it. It was about 200 to 300 feet above the ground. The object then re-appeared, hovering for a minute or two, and then suddenly disappeared again, just as it had before.

As we drove on, a similar object appeared ahead of us, this time much closer, about 100 feet off the ground. As we approached it, the object moved away from us and then suddenly disappeared. The windows of the car were all open, and we all had a clear view of the object as it moved away. The object seemed to be circular in shape, and was absolutely silent.

A few minutes later, as we passed the spot where the object had last been seen, we could see it very clearly, as it was now hovering just above the treetops. But now, as we watched, the object suddenly began to move, first slowly, and then with incredible speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. 

Two or three minutes later we got another glimpse of the object over the valley. It was now some distance away, and seemed to be moving slowly. Suddenly, it shot upward at a tremendous speed, and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.

This was the first clear view we got. As we watched, the object seemed to be a row of lights, perhaps five or six in number, in a circular formation. It was about the size of a basketball, and was hovering about 200 to 300 feet above the ground. In front of us and perhaps a mile to the right (south) on the highway, we noticed what appeared to be the same type of object, only much smaller. This was probably about 50 feet off the ground.

As we watched, the smaller object suddenly became very frightened, and continued to move more and more rapidly, until it disappeared from view. The larger object we had been watching also seemed to become very frightened, and continued to be more and more agitated, until it too disappeared from view.

For the rest of us, as he had an unobstructed view. My husband, driving and watching at the same time, said that the object looked something like a hat, round and saw more like a hat, round and slightly flattened on top.

As we drove on, we continued to watch for any sightings of the object, but there were no trees in the area to obscure our view. We did not see the object again. The night was very clear, and more agitated, and as we came nearer Kiukyu, we said that perhaps it was a UFO, in order to calm her. However, since we had seen it from time to time, this could not have been the case.

As we passed the road to Kiukyu, we could see the object very clearly, as we had before. But now we could not make out its shape. The one on the right was larger, and apparently was the one we had been watching. The one on the left seemed to be smaller.

We observed that wherever there were no trees between us for a few miles. Just as we approached the road, we saw the object very clearly. But now as we came closer, it shot upward at a tremendous speed, and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. 

We did not feel that we were being observed but rather that we had come upon them by chance. Gregory said we were somewhat frightened, but both became almost hysterical and he decided we had better drive on.

It is impossible to say whether we were observing a round object from the side or whether we were simply seeing lights. When it was in front of us, to the side, and behind us, we all had the impression of looking at the side of a solid object (that is, its core and parts). Gregory said he saw them as discs and could barely see an outline above the cars and as they zoomed away.

The lights did not fluctuate there was no light observable above or below the objects. None of the lights changed color while we observed them, nor was there any impression of anything expanding or diminishing.

The image contains no photograph, only text. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

anytime to be actually resting on the ground, but did appear more of the time to
be all through his body being hidden by the trees and foliage.

We continued to observe the objects until we got to Babets and turned off to the
left and continued on. They seemed to be following us as we turned off and flew a
short distance down the road and then turned off again. Where they finally went we
did not know, as the foliage was so dense we could not see them beyond that point.

After we turned towards Westlands we did not expect to see them again, as the road
follows a ridge and they had seemed to be starting down the valley out of our line
of sight.

While others are said to have seen a great many fall to the earth as our approach-
es the Nairobi city limits (30 mph zone). However, to our surprise, just as we
were approaching the hill in full sight of the Babets, we saw two definite objects
still very high. They were taking station at almost a perfect right angle to each
other, but moving very slowly, and we could see them until we got to the ABC
roundabout when they were definitely rising out of sight of the valley and gaining
altitude.

Ruth became very distressed and so we continued on, but if we had turned into the
Babets area we would have been in much closer position to these objects than be-
fore. As it is, I still do not know whether they had any connection with those we
had observed earlier or whether they were a separate sighting altogether. It is
possible that the size of the foliage of a DC-8 or larger they may have appeared
much larger than reality just being obscured.

They were moving very smoothly and deliberately, changing direction in ways that
belied any kind of normal aircraft but at the same time the motions were not vio-
lent or erratic as if it might be the attitude of the vehicle itself. I also no-
ticed that there was a feeling or "floating" or quietness about their motions.

About 10:15 p.m. we looked up into the sky but saw no sign or anything unusual. There
were no clouds, and the sky was clear.

We have been especially interested in UFOs, as a friend of ours had seen an
unidentification object cross the sky in broad daylight in November. We had not
been so fortunate as yet but were sure that there were more than enough objects in
that area, surely not in East Africa. All four of us, however, clearly saw these
objects not only on this occasion but also on several other occasions. At no time
were they stationary. At one time we stopped so that we could see more clearly. As our daughter is
still very upset about the whole thing we have not discussed it any further in
front of her except to reassure her that UFOs have never been known to harm any-
one. However, I am quite convinced that this is an actual sight and that this
is very nearly correct.

25 March 1967 Approx. 6 P.M.  
I was driving near Enfield, Mass. with my Brother John. We noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be about 8 ft. in diameter and shaped like a platter and hovered a few hundred feet in the air. The object moved rapidly from left to right, then up and down and then disappeared. It made no sound at all. We estimate we observed this object for about 1 minute.

There is no photograph present in this image. Instead, the image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be an official U.S. Air Force form. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

The reaction I observed was that a UFO was going to work and a UFO driving a different route and was unfamiliar with the area as it did not question the observation until it returned. The observation lasted 10 to 15 minutes and it filled the entire field of view. What was encountered was a brilliance of the windows. It seemed all of the witnesses were pouring steel (red glow) but if so, it would vary in brilliance. After thinking about it for 3 days, I finally arrive at the conclusion I recalled but could not tell my profile.

The image contains a diagram showing a curved line, an "A" point, a "B" point, and an "Observer" point. This diagram appears to be part of a "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" used by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book.

Proposed reply to letters from July 15, 1967 (sighting Mar 30, '67)

Dear [redacted],

Regarding your recent letters addressed to Maj. Hately and Sgt. Henderson, this is regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Where the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer a high degree of explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite lacking.

We would appreciate it if you could add more details concerning your observation, to your nearest military installation, at the time, an evaluation would have been possible.

Your information will be added to our present data.

Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention.

Dear Sgt. Jones.
My name is ******* I am 13 years old. I am a student at George Dewey Junior High School, Bremerton, Washington. I have quite an interest in UFOs. I would like to make sort of a study on UFOs. I am writing because I would like you to send me some pictures or information of some kind on UFOs. You probably are busy but if you could find time to do this I would appreciate it very much.
I will tell about my experience with a UFO. One night about 9:45 about March 20, 1967 my friend and I were looking at a star in the West. I was about to go in and get a higher powered lens than I looked to the East and saw some kind of object. I called my friends attention to the object. Both of us were scared. It made no noise that we could hear but my dog stared in the area of the object and started to whimper and bark. The object was illuminated but we could still see the outline of the object. It zig-zagged and seemed to take sharp turns. It traveled at about 5 or 600 miles per hour. It hovered over a tree for about 15 seconds then shot up and disappeared. I wanted to call the police or the nearest A.F.B. but my mother wouldn't let me. Thats the story. 
Yours truly,

You probably busy but if you could find time to do this I would appreciate it very much.

I will tell you about my experience with a UFO. One night about 9:45 about March 20,1967 my friend and I were out looking through my telescope at a star in the west. I was about to go in and get a higher powered lens I looked over into the east and saw some kind of object. I called my friends attention to the object. We both were scared. It made no noise that my friend or I could hear but my dog stared in the direction of the object and started to whimper and bark. The object was illuminated but we still could not see the outline of the object. It flickered and seemed to take sharp turns. It traveled at about 5 or 600 miles per hour. It hovered over a tree for about 15 seconds and then shot up and disappeared. I went in and told my mother about it after that. I wanted to call the police or the nearest A.F.B. but my mother wouldn't let me. That's the story.

Yours truly,

The image appears to contain text but no photograph. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:

On 22 March 1967 the crew of a Brazilian Air Force C-47 and the crew of a Brazilian Air Force F-86 aircraft were approaching Vinhedo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, southwest of the city. The object was initially sighted by the F-86 pilot and subsequently by the C-47 crew. The object was described as a reddish-colored full moon that appeared to be at very low altitude, and the tower asked the C-47 aircraft to intercept and identify the object. The C-47 crew made several attempts to contact the object but pursued it for some time before it finally disappeared. No pictures were taken of the object.
