UFO SIGHTING

On the 1st of August 1966, while on a flight to the Philippines, I sighted several lights in the sky which could be logically explained. I saw three evenly spaced lights, stacked similar to a stack of coins. The lights appeared momentarily but then disappeared and reappeared at another location. The several movements of the lights disappeared and reappeared at a new location. This overall phenomenon was the first I saw in my 25 years as a navigator, and slightly forward of our position.

Dear Captain Lagervall:

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified object:

The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. The slide itself, however, contains little that can be observed to the photographic image. Examination of the color slide has negated the possibility that these images are the result of a developing or processing defect, and they appear to be an accurate representation of the object viewed within them.

Regretfully, no other information has been submitted for information on aircraft activity that could have accounted for this particular observation; however, as such, no definite identification has been made. This is your 35 mm slide. Thank you for submitting it for evaluation.

STATEMENT

Reference Clark Air Base message DOI 007 August 1966, UFO Report. The deleterious object sighted was some 5500 feet and extensive.
I believe that because of the time lapse since the original sighting that I am unable to provide any information that would be of value or acticity.

At the time of the sighting we were flying a WG-13D2 aircraft at 18,000 feet. We were vectoring to the aircraft bank when the crew alerted me that they were observing unusual lights. I went forward and was able to observe these lights. We continued our intercept and I would estimate about 20 miles from the aircraft the object flashed brightly for a few seconds and then disappeared. It wax white in color and was quite bright. The object appeared to be slightly below our altitude. I would estimate its size to be that of a standard small aircraft. The formation was quite well maintained.

As the object started to disappear, we made a tight turn to observe it further. At this time they started a climb and were observed for approximately another 20 to 30 minutes. During this time they appeared to be rapidly gaining altitude and seemed to be leaving our vicinity. Their angle at about 10 degrees. This was done by using my hand extended at arm's length with the thumb and forefinger pinched.

The crew had previously informed me that another formation of these objects had previously passed our aircraft (500 degrees) just before I observed the second group. About 15 minutes after I had observed the UFO dash-climb and disappear, a 2nd formation of 3 to 5 UFOs appeared, observed and maneuvered in a similar manner to the first group. Their speed paralleled ours at 250 knots. This appeared to be about the same angular size as the first formation, but seemed to be about twice as distant.

When the UFOs departed, we estimated their speed to be in excess of 1500 miles per hour. The entire time of observation was about 45 minutes. They appeared to be disc-shaped and were glowing a bright reddish-orange color. When they disappeared, they seemed to blend into the weather.

Weather conditions were scattered, bright moonlight, and visibility unlimited.

A trained meteorologist was aboard.

STATEMENT

On 4 Aug 66 while flying storm reconnaissance, the pilot brought to my attention a number of 3 lights off the left outer screen, which appeared to be in formation. 

When I first sighted them, they were heading in a westerly direction ahead and to the left of our aircraft. As they passed, they changed attitude and speed rapidly, and pulled away from us. 

Believing them to be possible refueling aircraft, I checked for lights but was unable to detect any, either visually or thru binoculars. The lights gradually disappeared from sight shortly thereafter.

STATEMENT

On 1 Aug 66 while enroute to a storm reconnaissance area in the South China Sea, our navigator noticed that persons was tracking our aircraft on radar. While looking at this time, several lights were sighted (approximate 5 to 8 lights) closing to our position. These lights were observed to be moving in the opposite direction as our aircraft. There were 3 lights in a triangle formation and 2 others were in a straight line formation. The group of 3 lights was slightly lower in altitude than the 2 lights. I believe I was the last to see them as they disappeared behind our plane.
While watching the lights for some period of time, another group guide a hill as the first seen. As an aircraft, this was the first time I have ever seen anything like this formation with the load being as the lights. About fifteen (15) minutes before resuming our primary mission. At this time the navigator advised me that the original lights had decided they.
While scanning all around the aircraft for anymore possible sightings I saw 2 bright strobe lights which held almost a steady formation. I could also distinguish a hazy object but inability to identify him. He turned the aircraft far enough to the right to see this hazy object again but decided they moved off at a high rate of speed.

STATEMENT

Reference Clark Air Base message DOI 000009 August 9 1966, UFO Report. The details and information given in the message are the original sighting that am unable to provide any information that would be of value or entirely accurate.

At the time of the sighting we were flying a WC-121 aircraft at 15,000 feet. We were on a heading of 220 degrees, it was approximately 2100 hours. I was in the right seat and the co-pilot was in the left seat. I happened to glance to my right and toward the rear of the aircraft and observed three objects in a stack formation at our 2 o'clock position. They appeared to be about 5 miles distant. The objects were completely silent, their color was of a strange/yellow glow and was quite steady. Initially their altitude was difficult to determine but prior to their making any rapid speed/altitude changes appeared to be at approximately the same level as our aircraft. Their rate of speed was quite long, as I had to turn my head to watch the full length; the duration of the sighting was about 30 seconds.
As they proceeded on a heading of about 120-130 degrees, the formation was quite well maintained. I immediately called them to the attention of the co-pilot and he also observed them. They started a climb at this time and were observed for approximately another 30 seconds until they disappeared from our sight. Their angle at about 10 degrees. This was done by using my hand extended at arm's length with my thumb up and my fingers spread to indicate the angle of climb.

The crew had previously informed me that another formation of three objects had been observed earlier. About 10 minutes after I had observed the UFOs described, I was informed that the second group, About 5-10 minutes after I had observed the UFOs, a third group appeared at our 8 o'clock position. These objects appeared to be accelerating and their speed paralleled ours at 300 knots true airspeed. They were at a higher altitude but in trail formation. The lead UFO's lights would blink at a rate of five minutes of observing this second group, a third UFO was observed by our navigator at our 2 o'clock position for a brief period of time. This UFO appeared to be closing in on our track and was observed until it had reached a point approximately 1000 nautical miles out from Jomalug (Philippines). FOR when they disappeared.

Weather conditions were scattered, bright moonlight, and visibility unlimited.

STATEMENT

On the morning of 1 Aug 66 our crew was enroute to the South China Sea area, our altitude was 18,000 feet. We were in the left seat at the time the Navigator, Lt Weaver, mentioned that someone was "pointing" up, from our left. A bright light was observed by the crew for approx 5 min. It was under the plane and moving in a direction opposite from us. We were traveling almost due west, the lights approached us from the southeast at the same elevation as us. At times the lights appeared to be further away, at times closer, so it did not remain at a constant distance. The intensity or brightness of the lights varied which indicated they were under intelligent control.

At their closest approach, which I called to the attention of the crew to the formation of lights, and while we were watching them in fascination, they suddenly went out or the lights were extinguished. Immediately again after 2-5 seconds they reappeared, now much further away. It appeared to be further away from us, in that they took on a dimmer appearance.

We asked one of the crew members to get my camera. Unfortunately the camera could not be found and no pictures were obtained. The first impression we had of the objects appeared to be about the size of golf balls, but more flattened, oval objects. The way they maneuvered led us to believe they were aircraft of some type. My first impression was that they may have been aircraft of some type, but the brilliant, pulsating lights do not indicate that they were any type of aircraft as we know them.

We made one 90 degree level turn towards the objects, to see if we could get a bit closer. However, when we completed the turn they appeared to be climbing slightly and traveling away from us, so we returned to our original heading.

As we were during the 1 hour 30 minutes approximation, the 2nd group of lights had only 2 lights instead of 3. At the request of one of the crew members to see if I could describe any difference, I obliged in turning the plane to the left. (At our 9 o'clock position when we were on course) I cannot confirm what the object was, or whether it was aircraft or not, and I do not take it upon myself to make any good or bad assumptions with regards to what we saw. Suffice to say there are no reflections on the windows. I set the camera at f1:8, 1/125 second. The camera was hand-held during the shots. Two shots (misc. 36-37) were obtained showing what appeared to be the two objects, although it is almost impossible to see. The only two that clearly show the objects are not sufficient for evaluation, either the entire report did not reach you, or the question asked in AFR 200-2 (suspecting airplanes or astronomical) was not sufficient for evaluation.

STATEMENT

On 3 Aug 66 while flying storm reconnaissance, the pilot brought to my attention a number of lights off to the left of our aircraft. Immediately noticed three extremely bright lights (continuous yellow/white) which appeared to be in formation.

When I first detected these lights, they were ahead and to the left of our aircraft. As they passed they gained altitude and made a 180-degree turn, crossing behind us and moving in a southerly direction away from us.

I looked for them but was unable to detect any, either visually or thru binoculars. This lights gradually disappeared from sight.

STATEMENT

On 1 Aug 66 while enroute to a storm reconnaissance area in the South China Sea, we observed three bright lights over a town near the Philippine coast in the vicinity of Manila. At this time we were east of the Philippines at an altitude of about 27,000 feet, on a heading of about 090 degrees magnetic. We were looking to the east-northeast. They appeared to be stationary for a few minutes, then they started moving in the opposite direction to our aircraft. There were three lights in a loose formation or cluster, they were moving very fast and out of the corner of my eye, I saw a fourth light join the other three lights. As the cluster became dim I lost sight of them as they disappeared behind our plane. While searching the horizon for any additional sightings, I suddenly became aware of a bright light moving across our nose at a very fast rate of speed in the opposite direction of our aircraft. This bright light appeared to be at our 12 o'clock position passing us and as it did so it appeared to decelerate to a very fast but steady speed. As it took about 5 to 7 seconds to pass our nose, I was the last to see them as they disappeared behind our plane. Unlike the three lights which disappeared quickly, this bright single light seemed to gain altitude and continued on in the opposite direction from our aircraft. While watching these lights, I was trying to recall if they were distant stars or planets, but decided the first group of three lights in tight formation and their sudden speed and movement could not have been a celestial body. The bright single light also did not appear to be a celestial body, as it was too bright, too fast and too big in size compared to any star I've ever seen. After reading at 01:40, the pilot, Co-pilot, Navigator and Weather Observer confirmed the details of the sighting. The flight was maneuvered in an attempt to relocate and identify the lights but we were unsuccessful.
