Analysis of UFO Photograph

AFCIN-131

1. The attached photograph, taken by Pvt (E2) [redacted], was forwarded to ATIC by your office for analysis.

2. Analysis of the photograph indicates that the photo was probably exposed inside of a building and through a glass window. The object in question is probably a reflection on the window from a light hanging from the ceiling. The index of the shade creates an elliptical shape and the strong white area in the top central portion is the light bulb which also gives off a halation creating the "bump" on the top of this reflection.

3. Attached is the transparency for forwarding to the original owner.
The full address of the owner is:

1. Analysis of the movie film reveals nothing of an unusual nature. The film was poorly exposed and the panning was such that it is plausible to assume that a child was taking the pictures. There was also an indication of a light leak on certain portions of the film. The Air Intelligence Information Report was of no value as there was nothing in the film which even remotely resembled the objects mentioned in the report.

2. The 35MM transparency was probably exposed inside of a building and through a glass window. The object in question is probably a reflection on the window from a light hanging from the ceiling. The inside of the shade creates an elliptical shape and the strong white areas in the top central portion is the light bulb which also gives off a halation creating the "bump" on top of this reflection.

[The image appears to be a black and white photograph of an industrial or military facility, with various structures, buildings, and what seems to be a tall tower or mast in the center. The photograph looks somewhat grainy and dark, typical of mid-20th century documentary photography.]
