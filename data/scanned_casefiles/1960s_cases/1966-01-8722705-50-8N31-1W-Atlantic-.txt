P HRS 1 print, 1 negative

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-56 from Major H. Quintanilla, TDSW/UFO, who asked for an analysis of a negative and print depicting an Unidentified Flying Object.

2. ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Divisions. The image on the negative as provided, not from a water or camera. In fact, the image does not appear to be that of any defined object. The image could have been caused by refracted light from a small water droplet on the lens, water condensation on the film, or an internal camera reflection. A water droplet on the lens appears to be a reasonable explanation of the image.

The rest of the document appears to be a black and white photograph or image, which looks like a schematic or diagram with some geometric shapes and lines. The image is somewhat faded and low contrast, making details difficult to discern precisely. There appears to be an object or structure on the right side of the image with some angular lines extending from it.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and heavy black redaction marks.

water and the camera. In fact, the image does not appear to be that of any definable object.
The image could have been caused by refraction, light absorption, small water droplets on the lens,

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-55 from Major H. Quintanilla, UFOB/USO, who asked for an analysis of a negative and print depicting an Unidentified Flying Object.

2. ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Divisions. The image on the negative is probably not from an object on the water or between the water and the camera. In fact, the print appears to be the result of a small camera defect. The image could have been caused by refracted light from small water droplets on the lens. Water condensation on the film, or an unusual camera reflection, appears to be the most reasonable explanation of the image.

Dallas Police See Mysterious Flying Object

DALLAS (UPI) - Dallas policemen reported seeing a mysterious flying object hovering near downtown for more than two hours before dawn today.

The officers said the object continued a while after sunrise, was bright and dim. They said it moved more or less horizontally at the time.

Police at suburban Richardson also called about a similar object, but they reported a helicopter in the area at the time.

Calling the source, Glen Sims, a radio reporter, said the object was just before midnight with two red lights, one on each side. He said it hovered and it emitted a warning light.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THIS COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU ARE FACING WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "PIN" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THIS SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "PIN" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "PIN" WITH A LINE SCHEMATICALLY TO SHOW THE APPROXIMATE MOVEMENT MADE BY THE OBSERVER IN RELATION TO THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "PIN".

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your letter of 28 March 1966 regarding a photograph of an unidentified object. Photo analysis has been completed and we are returning your negative and print along with one extra print.

The following conclusions were made by the Photo Analysis Section:

a. The image on the negative is probably not from an object on the water or between the water and the camera. In fact, the image does not appear to be that of any defined object. The image could have been caused by refracted light from a small water droplet on the lens, water condensation on the film, or an internal camera reflection. A water droplet on the lens appears to be the most reasonable explanation of the image.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I am not a believer in flying saucers, so it is with some hesitancy I send you this photograph of an unidentified flying object.

I'm told it's either a flying Jelly Fish, reflection off the tail catcher on the boat or film defect. Since it is a complete mystery to me, I want to know what it is or can explain it to me I would like to know. As for me, I like the flying Jelly Fish explanation.

Although the picture has only recently been developed, it was taken about the first of the year by my four year old boy.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Jerry Moss

P. S. Could be bubble gum on camera lens?
