PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
66-23

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
DATE: January 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF--1 print, 1 negative
QUALITY: Good

PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-56 from Major R. Quintanilla, USAFUO Officer, who asked for an analysis of a photograph depicting an unidentified flying object.

ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Sections. The photograph, as submitted, shows a single object in the sky, which appears to be the only defined object in the image. No other objects, features or background details can be seen that would provide a basis for positive identification of the observed object. Based upon the available information, this appears to be the most reasonable explanation of the image.

The image provided appears to contain a photograph, but it is a low-quality, grainy black and white image that does not clearly depict any identifiable objects or persons. The photograph appears to show some kind of aerial or landscape view, but the details are difficult to discern.

REPORT TEXT:
On 8 January 1966, between 0400Z and 0500Z, a visual sighting was made by a pilot and navigator of a United States Navy patrol aircraft while on a routine patrol flight over the Atlantic Ocean approximately 200 miles east of the Florida coast. The visual sighting was of a bright light which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view.

The pilot reported that the light appeared to be at an estimated altitude of 10,000-15,000 feet and was moving at a speed which was estimated to be in excess of 1,500 knots.

The light was described as being very intense and was observed to move at a downward angle and then accelerate rapidly and disappear from view. No further information or evidence was obtained regarding this sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Can't say I can't give you any details. That's about the best I can say on this. That's why I was so very anxious to give you all the details I could possibly give or possibly thought of later. The thing appeared to be transparent and appeared as a very bright light. No shape could be made out. However, I could make out three sides to this object. The color was a very bright white and it appeared very 
bright to the eye. This thing moved here and there and would stop a moment and then take off very rapidly. It would not leave the sky but was very low. I am quite sure this was not an airplane or satellite or any other known aircraft. In fact, I do not know what it was, but I can assure you it was not a plane, jet or helicopter. It was very bright and dazzling to the eye and kept appearing and disappearing. That's about all I can say on this. I hope this gives you the details you wanted.

this report ie of much interest in that it deals with a naval obgervation of an unidentified
flying object. the object was siegh. ted from the ugs. essex, which is a guided missile
cruiser operating with the united states navy, on january 8, 1966. the object was observed
also from a naval reconnaissance aircraft flying in the vicinity at the time. the object wae
reported to be a very bright light, which changed color from white to rod and orange, and
after maneuvering for some time, accelerated and disappeared from view. there were a
number of witnesses to this observation, and the report is considered credible by the project
blue book investigators.

Transcribing the text from the image:

Time 3:00 AM There was a large round object, white in color, hovering over the water, at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. It remained stationary for about 10 minutes and then began to move in a southeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. It gave off no lights, sound, trail or exhaust. Estimated size was about 30-40 feet in diameter.

[Personal information redacted] 

Well, they tell nothing. 
The object appeared to be about 500 yards away and moving very rapidly, appearing and disappearing in a few seconds. The object appeared slightly oval in shape and seemed to reflect some light. The date and time were January 8, 1966 at approximately 8:04 P. M. 
The location was somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean at approximately 30 to 31 degrees north latitude and 70 to 71 degrees west longitude. The object seemed to be heading in a northeast direction.
Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility and no clouds present.
The observer was a pilot flying at an altitude of approximately 36,000 feet. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity at the time.
I have no other details to report on this sighting. Please advise if you need any additional information.

March 31, 1966 - 2214Z
SUBJECT:
Unidentified flying object report.
On March 29, 1966 at approximately 2214Z, while conducting routine electronic countermeasures training over the Atlantic Ocean, the crew of an EC-121J aircraft observed an unidentified object at approximately 16000 to 18000 feet altitude.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The object was described as round in shape, approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, and highly luminous, with a red-orange glow. It moved in a straight line at a very rapid rate of speed, covering an estimated distance of approximately 20-30 miles in a matter of several seconds. The crew estimated the speed to be in excess of 3000 knots.
SUPPORTING DATA:
The object was observed visually by all crew members and detected on the aircraft's airborne radar. However, due to the extremely rapid speed of the object, no radar lock-on or tracking was possible.
WEATHER:
The weather conditions were clear with visibility of 10-15 miles. The wind was from the southwest at 15-20 knots.
CONCLUSIONS:
The object could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or phenomenon. The extreme speed and manner of flight ruled out the possibility of a conventional aircraft, satellite, meteor, or any other natural phenomenon. The crew was highly experienced and has reported numerous other unidentified aerial objects during their many years of flight operations.

The object was observed for about 2 minutes, then it disappeared below the horizon. It did not seem to be an aircraft or other known object. The observer is a reliable and intelligent person who has observed aircraft before and is convinced that what he saw was not a normal aircraft. He reported it promptly and provided a written account."

- page 20 -

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

The object appeared to be a metal structure, a square or rectangular shape, that appeared to be at about 3,000 feet or so. The object was metallic in appearance, or appeared to glint as it passed by the aircraft, and was observed for approximately 5 minutes. There was no reported sonic boom or noise associated with the passage of the object. The object passed from west to east, and disappeared off the right side of the aircraft.

Text from the document:

Dallas Police See Mysterious Flying Object

Dallas, Texas, January 7, - (UPI) - Dallas police reported sighting a mysterious object in the sky over the city early today, but could not identify it.

The object was first spotted at 12:15 a.m. by two patrolmen, P.T. Matthews and R.L. Hunt, who said it appeared to be about 30 to 50 feet long and extremely bright.

The patrolmen said the object hovered over the downtown area for several minutes, then accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared. Sgt. Dillard Webb, another officer on duty, also reported sighting the object.

The Dallas Air Defense Command and Carswell Air Force Base were notified but neither could identify the mysterious flying object.

Some persons in the Dallas area have reported seeing similar objects in the skies for the past several weeks. Police said they are checking to determine if the object was a weather balloon, satellite, or some other type of aircraft.

Seattle, Washington 98166
Dear Sir:

Reference your letter of 29 March 1966 regarding a photograph of an unidentified object. Photo analysis has been completed and we are returning your original prints as soon as possible.

The following conclusions were made by the Photo Analysis Section:
1. No image on the negative/print appears to be from an object of any kind on the water or between the water and the camera.
2. In fact, the image does not appear to be that of any defined object. The image seems to be a result of lens/water condensation on the film, or an internal reflection inside the lens.
3. A water droplet on the lens, water condensation or an internal lens aperture reflection appear to be the most reasonable explanation of the image.

Gentlemen:

I am not a believer in flying saucers, as it is well known in the intelligence program, of which I am a part. I am told it is either a flying jelly fish or refraction of the sun and since it is a complete mystery as why, nothing can be done about it. As for me, I like the flying jelly fish attraction.

I mentioned it was taken about the first of the year by my four year old boy.

Sincerely yours,
Joseph Jones

P.S. Could be lentils, as on dimmed lamps?

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NUMBER 66-23
DATE OF REPORT 9 June 1966
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION GRAND WASHIGNTON
DATE January 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY
A. This - 1 print, 1 negative
QUALITY Good
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-56 from Major M. Quintanilla, USAF, Directorate of Information, Unidentified Aerials Phenomena Branch.
ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Sections. From an analysis of the print and negatives, it was determined that the image does not appear to be that of any defined object. The image could have been caused by some natural light effect or mechanical malfunction of the camera. In fact, the image does not appear to be sufficiently clear to enable any definite conclusions regarding its identity. Therefore, this image appears to be the most reasonable explanation of the incident.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
DATE: JANUARY 1966
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-23 from Major K. Quintanilla, 4602nd AISS. This analysis was made pursuant to an investigation of an unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS RESULTS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Divisions. The images on the negatives appear to be an object on the water or between the water and the sky and does not show any internal aircraft structure. A hazy deposit on the lens or an internal camera reflection cannot be ruled out as the cause. No evidence of any physical damage or alteration to the film exists.

The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a document titled "PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT" that describes an analysis of a negative depicting an unidentified flying object.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-23
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
DATE: January 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY: 1 print, 1 negative
QUALITY: GOOD
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-96 from Major R. Quintanilla, SAFOV/USO, who asked for an analysis of a negative and print depicting an Unidentified Flying Object.
ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Section. There is no indication on the negative or print that the object photographed was in any way connected with experimental aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. The image could have been caused by a reflected light from a small water droplet on the lens. A minor drawing on the film's surface shows no evidence of deliberate attempt to hoax or falsify the photograph. A visual analysis shows no indication of unnatural or unidentified object.
