UFO REPORT

TD-X2                                                                  18 Sep 62

TO:   TD-F (Col Pitend)

The following, extracted from Maj Edward's OD Report dated 17 Sep 62, is quoted for your information:

Two UFO reports were received. The first was from the Dayton Post of the Ohio State Patrol which was reporting third person sightings made by Sheriffs Deputies, private citizens, and Ohio State Patrolman in the St Clairsville around 0905 thru 0402, 13 Sep. The second was by the Lockbourne AFB SAC Command Post which gave the records of two sightings by B-47 Aircraft Commanders who were "in trail" 63 NM apart flying in over Tennessee (353NW/870W).

Names:   Deputy Donald Corey, 435 Idora, Youngstown, Ohio
         Deputy John D. Katinas, 133 Monroe St., Campbell, Ohio
         Patrolman John W. Conner, Ohio State Patrol, Box 377, St. Clairsville, Ohio
         Dispatcher E.L. Kuhn, Ohio State Patrol, Box 337, S. Clairsville, Ohio
         Mrs. [illegible], St. Clairsville, Ohio

Note:   None of these people reported directly - report was third person by Dayton Post of Ohio State Patrol.

The second report was from Lockbourne AFB SAC Command Post:

Aircraft Commanders:
Lead Aircraft - Captain J.F. Krill, 4745IA, 513th
                Bomb Sqdn, Lockbourne AFB
Aircraft #2 - Captain W.T. Wetzel, 22259A, 513th
               Bomb Sqdn, Lockbourne AFB

Briefly: SAC pilots and ground observers saw "funnel shaped cloud" in a level position like a "super con trail" with an extremely bright light at the apex of the cone. Light lasted for about 30 seconds and cloud dispersed quickly after light went out. SAC pilots were over Tennessee heading north and ground observers were in Ohio looking south. Time: 0405am (090532). Weather: Clear, moonlite night, visibility unlimited.
