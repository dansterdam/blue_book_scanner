UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: MOROCCO

Date: 15 Nov 1960     Hour (Z): 20547

"X Clear, 5 mi vis in haze, winds westerly at 0-10, knows, scattered clouds

Description: Round, size of object between softball and basketball, orange-red, heard sound similar to high-flying multi-engine acft, first seen over left shoulder while looking south-20 deg. azimuth, last seen at about 45 deg elev at 200 deg. obj moved straight, viewed for 3-5 seconds

Direction of Motion: SSW

Satellite: (AFCIN-463, Phone 69219)     Filed out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): no meteor

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1):     None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc):

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.:     Filed out

Other: staff data - witness

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Poor reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: There were no satellites reported to be identified in time. Altitude of the object was no reported which was the case with most aerial reports. The object was moving at a speed of about 5 miles per hour. There were witness reports that the speed of the objects was about 5 times that of sound. This was true. The object was on or near the ground. The object observed will probably a very low meteor that made the night in ward, and was a clear observation to pass out of the earth's atmosphere. However, there was only one witness to the phenomena, therefore this
