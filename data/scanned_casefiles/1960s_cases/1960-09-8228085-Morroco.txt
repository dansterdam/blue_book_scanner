The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document titled "UFO ANALYSIS SHEET" that describes an observation made at Morocco on 8 September 1960.

The text in the document is as follows:

Location: MOROCCO 
Date: 8/9/60 
Hour (s): 20:32
Wx: Clear, 5 m/s winds from SE to NW (descriptive at D-45 knots, scattered clouds
Description: Round, size of object between telephone and basketball, orange-red, maneuvered on and off straight-line course. Appeared to be around 45 deg elev at 200 deg, got moved straight, viewed for 3-5 seconds.
Direction of Motion: SE
Satellites: (ASCIN-46). Phone 692193 - Passed out
Astronomical Phenomena (meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): NONE
Radar Analysis (ASCIN-481): NONE
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): NONE
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Passed out
Other: No further details known
Evaluation of Source Reliability: POOR reliability

Analysis and Conclusions: There was no malicious or direct threat to national security involved. Unless this unidentified object was tracked on radar, determined to be a satellite, or evidence that it was an aircraft, balloon, or other man-made object, it remains of unknown origin. The speed and maneuverability suggest it was not a conventional aircraft. Caution is advised for other observers to pass out of the sighting as this individual did.
