11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer was traveling west on IR-70 when two unusual lights appeared over Richmond. One of the lights was visible for about 30 minutes after having reappeared after its initial disappearance. The first light moved up and down very quickly for short distances. When the second light appeared it moved right down, left up before its disappearance. Observer stated that as he traveled the objects were still in the relatively same area as when he first saw them.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   1   June   1966
                                                    Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

THE OBJECTS(LIGHTS) WERE NOT OF AN AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER AND WERE NOT CONNECTED TO THE GROUND.

I TRIED TO COMPARE THEM TO OBJECTS IN THE AREA. I SAW A COUPLE OF AIRPLANES TO THE WEST BUT THE "LIGHTS" WERE "TOO BRIGHT TO BE AN AIRPLANE" AND THE CORRECT RUNNING LIGHTS DID NOT EXIST. THE "LIGHTS" WERE "TOO FAR ABOVE THE GROUND" TO BE WARNING LIGHTS ON A GROUND OBJECT. AS I TRAVELED I WATCHED THEM WHILE I TRAVELED OVER 30 MILES AND THEY WERE STILL IN THE RELATIVELY SAME AREA AS WHEN I FIRST SAW THEM. I WATCHED THE ONE LIGHT FOR OVER 30 MINUTES WHILE THE SECOND ONE I SAW ONLY THE LAST 5 MINUTES OR LESS. IT APPEARED AND I SAW ITS MOVEMENT WHILE I WAS STOPPED AND MY WINDOW ROLLED DOWN.

IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.   SINCERELY,   YOURS

MICHIGAN [letterhead with university seal]

Boston 24/7/66
June 23 1966

Dear Sirs,

While traveling west on interstate 70 on Friday May 20, 1966 at about 10:30 P.M. I saw two unusual lights over Richmond, Indiana. I obtained one of the lights for over two to five minutes. The lights were not those of an airplane or anything connected with the ground, and so far as I know it was a clear red light which was much brighter than an airplane's light, and I put it blacked it on and off.

There are a few of the facts about the lights which I saw. I am interested in knowing what they were and if anyone else reported them.

If you are interested in more facts about these lights which I sighted, we are willing to contact me at [blacked out] present date until June 10 and after that at [blacked out].

Sincerely yours
[signature blacked out]
Albuquerque, New Mexico
