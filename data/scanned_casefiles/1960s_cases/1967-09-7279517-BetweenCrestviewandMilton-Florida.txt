10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
The sighting was not reported until more than 6 months later.
Because of the age of the report it is being evaluated as
insufficient data.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted 6 very bright, constant red, spherical
lights. The lights traveled in single file and circled
observers car. He tried to outrun then but they stayed
ahead of him as if mocking us. The observer stopped and th
lights buzzed his car. When the observer reached a sparsely
populated area the chase ended. At some time during the
observation the observer rolled down his windows and heard a
low pitch sort of hum.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some words are partially illegible or cut off at the edges of the page]

[First paragraph appears to discuss something between municipalities of Crestview and Milton, Florida, with references to royalties and some activity in miles]

Casually classifying at that point I was extended to five lines a six 'lights' tract to move in a procession of one clear another one same single file order that was mile still, watching I began.

I asked my friend ( he was driving ) to look while seeing if I was seeing something real, noting that there was something unusual in there as both continued to watch. To arrive at distinction came.

[The last line appears partially cut off and somewhat illegible]

The text seems to be part of a narrative describing an observation of some kind of lights or movement, potentially related to a UFO sighting between Crestview and Milton, Florida.

"stationary in a North-Westerly position while against a clear
night sky . . . all six 'lights' started to move in a procession
of one after another the same single file order they held while
still . . . By this time the six objects had circled our car
keeping the same approximate altitude and distance when they
abruptly stopped. Up to that time we were trying to out-run them
from about 70 m.p.h. to 130 m.p.h. (high stroked 396 SS Chevy).
However, they kept up and stayed slightly ahead as if mocking us.

. Finally they stopped off the passenger side, in turn we decided
to stop. As we both got out . . . the objects still in single file
separated. The last one moved a few thousand yards behind the
group after which the next to the last one (5th) slowly descended
to hover above the tree tops. After making these maneuvers they
remained so for a few sec. . . . At this point they gathered at
the spot where we had been and lined up in a front line position.
After circling the area they proceeded to buzz us resuming finally
their original positions. Upon reaching a sparsely populated area
the chase ended."
