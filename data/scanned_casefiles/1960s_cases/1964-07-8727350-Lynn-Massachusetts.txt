Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you detailed the observation of an Unidentified Flying Object.

Our Project Blue Book office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, has attempted an evaluation of this observation from the details you gave. The motion and description or the object is comparable to that of a radiosonde or a rawinsonde balloon with a light attached.

Enclosed is a summary of information on Project Blue Book, the program for the investigation and evaluation of UFO reports. We think this information will be of interest to you.

Dear Major Jack,

I have received the new Eastern AFB UFO report - which was submitted by me, and forwarded to 1st Sgt. Ellington, Hq. Mayer. The evaluation is a joke. I'll go along with that for Douglas, but if it is necessary to make a serious belief in this matter, then there is really great cause for concern over the intelligence of those responsible for such an evaluation. I consider this UFO a gross affront to the intelligence of those involved in this sighting. You know better than to believe this, and so do I.

Sincerely,

As you may be aware, I have been involved in another UFO, seemingly unwittingly, over a daylight eight. Sing somewhat in this shaped object stopped down in this city directly, and then reversed. This case was discussed by myself and a person who kindly, position of director of Flight Testing on Project SAGE, as I am already aware that these so-called UFO are actively clean space craft from elsewhere. I felt that some several of these craft have appeared and maneuvered over my home area a period of time. That a pattern of activity at best perhaps been shown to exist on the part of the occupants of said craft. If so I feel that some good use could be made of this fact, if at all is a fact.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,

On Saturday night at 10:55 PM, a UFO, maneuvered over Lynn, Mass. There it was some magnitude, as the echo on satellite. My wife and I watched this object as it traveled south, south-east. It moved at the same apparent speed as Echo 1 and I thought that it was not a plane, as the object it showed clearly and stopped then moved at a point directly over - head, quickly came to a stop again. It seemed motionless. This time, on a careful survey, then mistaken for a star. This is not a plane. It is to the naked eye. This watch

I was called on the telephone at
10:55 p.m. there about by my
sister who lives about a quarter
mile from my home and she
told me she and her hus-
band had watched it the at-

10 minutes before she called
me to go out and see it.

This same object had occasionally
been definitely over her place
during very bright, lighting
up the immediate area and
giving the sky a dark blue
color. This object also stayed

my wife and I were observing
this object, it stiffed and moved

I arrived outside with my

difficult to get my eye to

sat this scope out. This gave me
an angle view so I was able

1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. [redacted] regarding
a satellite-like observation on 13 Jul 64 at Lynn, Massachusetts.

2. The direction of motion to the SSW is contrary to normal
orbital flights. The motion and description of the object is
comparable with a radiosonde or a ravinsonde balloon with a light
attached. With the exception of the lighting up of the immediate
area, which was not observed by Mr. [redacted], but reported by his
sister, no association can be established between the object
observed by him and his wife or that of his sister. It is suggested that Mr. [redacted] be informed that his sighting has been
evaluated as a probable balloon observation and that a Fact
Sheet be forwarded to explain the Air Force's position on unidentified flying objects.

I have been to Houghton Planetarium on Tuesday, July 14, 1964, as I had our Planetarium to talk to Mr. Walter M. Webb, director of the Planetarium. The purpose of this appointment had been to discuss a new method by myself, and a friend of this time. Mr. Webb brought up the real test of the UFO and mention of a recent reports of sightings. Mr. Houghton was also there, in which the object made a near landing. He also said he was interested in getting recent sightings.

Four days after this request, I have sent this report to Mr. Webb, and have asked for a meeting, with his help, to fully discuss the UFO situation.

His feeling is to tell the truth, and let the chips fall where they may.
