The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose or wind rose diagram, which appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed object. The smaller sketches on the bottom show a silhouette of a person standing in a landscape, and a landscape scene with hills or mountains.

The text in the document is as follows:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE A CHECK MARK (X) AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH WAS SEEN, AND A STAR (★) AT THE LOCATION FROM WHICH THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE.

Transcribed text from the document:

Object first reported to me by calling He then went out and looked it thought it. through binoculars it was then a U.S. Air Force Plane but when he looked through thought it.

It disappeared by becoming extremely bright and then went vertically into the sky and was lost among the stars.

Moved in front of a plane blocking it out of our view for a very short time. Passed than one second. Could then tell the difference between the plane and the object.

This object looked like one of the many which have been shot into the sky and then seems to time the echo battelle of sometime ago.

USAF 
VEHICLE CASE REPORT 
LOCATION: ALLIS 
DATE: 1/15/
I am writing this report because it seems that the object that was reported sighted does not appear to be the kind of thing that we have come to expect as a normal aircraft. I have a friend who has also seen the same object and he describes it as being much different from any aircraft he has ever seen before. The object appeared to be of a round or disk like shape and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. It seemed to be able to change directions very rapidly and to hover in mid-air as well. The object did not have any wings, tail, or other aircraft type appendages that we would normally expect to see on an airplane or helicopter. The object was sighted on several occasions over a period of two days and the descriptions given by the various observers seem to be consistent. I would be interested in knowing if your organization has had any other reports of similar sightings in this area and whether you have any explanation for what the object could have been.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a document describing a UFO sighting incident.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Erratic
8. PHOTOS: D Yes 9274
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: D Yes 5204
10. CONCLUSION: At 2:00 CST, 4 August 1964, an observer sighted a bright light, stationary at 43 deg azimuth and 112 deg elevation, moving erratically and then disappearing at 104 deg azimuth. The observer estimated the light to be approximately 127 deg long, 3-5 deg wide. The observer sighted a bright white light that resembled the stars, and reminded him of a satellite (in shape, path, and size). The object disappeared by going straight and away from the observer.

DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENON IN YOUR OWN WORDS. WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE? WHAT DID IT DO? DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THING OBSERVED AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.
I started to watch a satellite while standing on the patio. The object appeared to be very high in the sky and was proceeding on a constant course, going from east to west. At first I thought it might be a satellite until it suddenly stopped and then reversed direction, going back to the east for a very short distance and then stopped again. It then continued on in its original westward direction but was not following a straight course, rather it was zigzagging back and forth. The object was very bright and had a tail behind it. It seemed to be a solid object, not just a light. I watched it for several minutes until it disappeared from my view. It did not seem to be an aircraft, helicopter or a satellite in the normal sense of the word.
DO YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMALS OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY? [YES] [NO] IF YES, DESCRIBE.

The image contains a diagram showing the movement of an observed object in the sky. The diagram appears to be part of a "Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" filled out on Wednesday, February 5, 1964. The questionnaire describes the object as being "very high in the sky and seemed to follow the same trajectory coming from the north and going the same."

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be a handwritten account or description of a UFO sighting experience.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"We went out to the same location the next night. We did group to help look for any object. It wasn't long when we saw it again. we was so thrilled that it was so visible. We reported the spot at 9:00 and stayed open that night till 11:30. This allowed plenty of time to observe the object and we see it out slightly for 40 or 45 minutes. Most of this time the object was a bright light and once in a while it would dig down or disappear. When it was out our sight on the horizon, we would try the same but the object refused to come out. The only way we describe that the object was not like a star or planet was that it was continuously moving and we decided that it was not a star or planet that we were looking at. The object appeared to have a steady glow and would occasional dim then bright again. Its altitude appeared to be low and early estimate would place it at around 2,000-3,000 feet. Its speed and attitude appeared to be very different from that of a conventional aircraft."
