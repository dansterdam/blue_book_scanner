10. CONCLUSION
Satellite (Echo II) satellite. One witness thought it was a satellite. He compared it to Echo
satellite. At 2304, Echo II was going SE at approximately
coordinates, 80 deg longitude, 40 deg latitude. The observers
confirm coordinates as 39 deg latitude and 42 deg longitude.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted what he described as a solid silver light that
was self-luminous and brighter than any star. The object
traveled from the W to ESE and at one point passed in front of
a plane blocking out the plane. It stopped at one point for
one minute and five seconds and disappeared by becoming
extremely bright and going vertically into the sky and was
was lost among the stars.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?]

The object was first reported to me by [REDACTED]. We then went out and looked and saw it, too. Though it might be a balloon or plane but when we looked through binoculars it disproved these thoughts.

It disappeared by becoming extremely bright and then went vertically into the sky and was lost among the stars.

3. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

Moved in front of a plane blocking it out of our view for a very short time less than one second. Could then tell the difference between the plane and the object.

Dear Sirs:

On the evening of 14 FEB '68 I was calling home when I saw when I stopped to glare up not the sky. I saw no strange wide object moving slowly through the sky. I watched it was about a minute then went to the sky. With binoculars I saw about 100 yds away. I told the instant then went outside and watched the object with binoculars. After this we called BLUE BOOK and told us to call Wright-Patterson AFB which we did. When we again went outside the object was gone. That you for following to solve this case.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

friend) went back to the same location the next night. [redacted] went along to help look for any object. If we had seen it again, we would think that it was a satellite, we waited the spot at 8:00 and stayed until 9:40. This allowed plenty of time (before and after our sighting) for it to appear. We had 5 telescope and a pair of binoculars along in case of another sighting. We were in the same spot exactly and were outside the car. It was another moonless night but the stars were not as bright. The sky was clear. We did not see the object again.

18-019. THE OBJECT LOOKED TO HAVE SPEED and altitude of a satellite. I know that speed and altitude vary with different type orbit, so I cannot give a true estimate of its speed and altitude.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

AFR 80-17(CL)

[Top text is partially illegible, but appears to be instructions for filling out the document]

In the sketch below, place an "A" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen and a "B" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect "A" and "B" with an arrow to approximate the movement of the phenomenon between "A" and "B". That is, schematically show whether the movement appeared to be direct, curved, or erratic. An example is shown in the larger sketch.

[The document contains a compass rose/directional diagram at the top and two sketches showing landscape/terrain with movement indicators]
