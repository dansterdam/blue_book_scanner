NAME(S) OF PERSON(S) CONTACTED OR IN CONFERENCE AND LOCATION:
Mr. Little, WM-3

SUBJECT:
Balloon

DIGEST:
Mr. Little called concerning the balloon and we discussed it briefly. He stated that Mr. Flener had been designated by Dave Thomas to be the one to keep an eye on the situation and take whatever action was appropriate. Mr. Little asked that Memphis Center work closely with Fort Worth Control and Memphis Flight Control Central with current information. Mr. Flener would like to know immediately when any of the following conditions occur:

1. If the balloon descends at any time below 45,000 feet.

2. The instant it reaches the coastline.

3. If at any time we lose contact or are unable to determine where the balloon is.

He advise Mr. Flener if balloon moves substantially further north or west to call the Watch Supervisor and locate the balloon, including height. The Watch Supervisor should check for current information as to location and weather which will be available for Mr. Flener, if asked for.

Mr. Little stated that FAA will trust GCI for location and painting of the balloon tonight instead of aircraft maintaining a watch.

Watch Supervisors are requested to notify Mr. Flener immediately concerning items 1, 2, and 3 above, or any other information considered significant. Also significant information should be forwarded to Mr. Wyatt-Lewis for the Area Office.

THAT THE BALLOON HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE AREA APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS,

THE MOST LOGICAL EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING IS THAT 
THE OBSERVER SAW THE LARGE WEATHER BALLOON WHICH REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN 
DRIFTING IN THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS. SEVERAL OFFICERS 
HAVE REPORTED SEEING THE BALLOON. THE B-52 WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER 
OBSERVATION FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER AND 
UNDOUBTEDLY WAS TOO FAR AWAY AND TOO HIGH TO BE OBSERVED, PARTICULARLY 
IN VIEW OF THE LATE AFTERNOON TIME OF OBSERVATION. IT WILL BE NOTED 
THAT THE OBSERVER REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT 
APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES BEFORE SUNSET AND WAS IN VIEW FOR 
APPROXIMATELY ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS BUT DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SUN 
WENT DOWN. THIS APPARENT DISCREPANCY MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE 
FACT THAT EMINENCE, MO, IS ON DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OR BY POSSIBLE 
ERRORS IN THE OBSERVER'S ESTIMATE OF THE TIME OF DAY, BUT THE
