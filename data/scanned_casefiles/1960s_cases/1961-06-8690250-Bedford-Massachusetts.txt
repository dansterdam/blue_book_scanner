Dear Mr. Goodwin:
It is very difficult for me to appreciate your telephone conversation regarding this incident on the evening of June 14, 1961. The times quoted, 3:00 and 3:05 A.M.
Direction low in the northeast over Maynard & vicinity heading north.
Duration, approximately 10 minutes.
This incident is to be treated as confidential as expressed to be desired by yourself on last evening as confidential for reasons of your own. I still have no additional information as to the nature or purpose of these cases which have been reported to me from one or two other sources, and I have made no effort as yet to pursue the matter further.
I trust the information herein will be of some interest to you.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"Between 11:20 and 11:30 a light was observed in the sky near the home of the observer. The light was variable and appeared to be moving. At first it was a small bright light. It increased in size until it was the size of a basketball and then decreased in size again to the size of a small light. This process was repeated several times. The light was observed for approximately 30 minutes. At times it appeared to change color, going from white to reddish in color. At one point the light appeared to be accompanied by a second light. Both lights then appeared to separate and move independently. At the end of the observation, the light(s) appeared to move off and disappear."

The text in the document is as follows:

"This morning I looked out the kitchen window and saw an object. This object was stationary at first but it then started to move very rapidly in a northerly direction. It was silvery in color and shaped like a saucer. The brilliance of the object was so great that I can't compare it to anything I've ever seen before. It seemed to be about 100 to 150 feet in diameter. If I estimate accurately, it was about 1500 to 2000 feet in the air. The object then seemed to gather tremendous speed and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The whole observation took only 2 to 3 minutes. I'm convinced that this was no conventional aircraft. I might have been more interested in pursuing this matter further, but I thought it best not to say anything to anyone about it and just let it pass. I'm sure you understand how I feel about this."

UFO SIGHTING (Ir) 22 May 1961
NEAR BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS
ORIGINAL DATA: ADC 32-55 (MAJ Winkleman)
T DATE: 29 MAY 1961

1. Intelligence has reported to my of a director of the Boston Red Sox baseball club which observed a UFO on 22 May 1961 at approximately 10:45 PM EST over Bedford, Massachusetts. A copy of the director's letter is attached indicating a request not to disclose his identity.

2. Initial object sightning and description: The witness observed a luminous object in the sky which was circular in shape, about the size of a basketball at arm's length, and which emitted a steady glow. The object hovered motionless for 1-2 minutes, then made an abrupt 90 degree turn and accelerated rapidly out of sight in an straight-line path at a steep angle, disappearing in 10-15 seconds. The object gave the appearance of a single solid structure and no protrusions were observed.

3. The conclusion that this was probably an extremely unusual aerial phenomena is supported by: The apparent ability to hover motionless, make an abrupt right-angle turn, and accelerate at a high rate of speed out of sight within 10-15 seconds. These characteristics are not consistent with known aircraft performance. As the sighting occurred at night, the witness was unable to detect any exhaust or propulsion system. The witness is reported to be a mature and intelligent individual whose occupation would not normally lead to imaginative reports of this nature.

4. Report Information: For the consideration of your headquarters, I concur with the conclusion that this sighting appears to represent an extremely unusual aerial phenomena. As the sighting was of brief duration, no further investigative data is available.

Producing the OCR output of the text in the document:

The sighting reported above does not seem to have much more significance than any other such reports. The observer is apparently an intelligent and reasonably credible person but the details given seem rather meager and inconclusive. No other evidence or information is available.

The sighting is reported in good faith and appears to represent the observer's honest impression of what he saw. However, the report does not contain specifics which would make it possible to reach any definite conclusion. The object described could have been any of a number of natural or artificial phenomena.

In view of the sketchy nature of the details given, it does not appear that any further investigation would be warranted or productive. The report is therefore being filed without further action.

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,
William K. Coleman
Lt, USAF
Assistant Chief, Project Blue Book
