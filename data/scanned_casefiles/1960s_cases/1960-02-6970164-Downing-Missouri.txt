10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round silver object about the size of a 10"
diameter plate. Floating to the SW. Observed
for over half an hour. First observation at
1.55 deg elevation and estimated distance of
two miles. After floating to the SW, just
disappeared. Winds to the east at all levels
and speed about 15 knots.

11. COMMENTS
Observation by one witness, however
all indications except the altitude
point to a balloon observation. It
is quite possible that the witness
could have made an error in his
estimation of direction, speed of the
object and duration of the sighting
and/or to a balloon observation
though information is consistent with
evaluation of this sighting as a balloon.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☑ Unknown
