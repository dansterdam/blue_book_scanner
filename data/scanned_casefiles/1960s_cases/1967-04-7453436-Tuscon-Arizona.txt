Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This replies to your recent letter in which you requested information on your unidentified observation of April 9, 1967.

We have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information. Essential data, such as flight characteristics, angular velocities, maneuvers, etc., are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The UFO involved was at your request, and military installation is in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

If you should ever witness another strange phenomena in our atmosphere, contact the UFO investigator at Stewart Air Force Base, New York.

Dear:

Has the Air Force reached a conclusion pertaining to my sighting of a UFO questionnaire to Wright Patterson AFB the most of April this year.

I was asked for the impression that a representative of the Air Force would contact to discuss. This has not been done.

I now have received a conclusion please note a C & D UFO organization. We support the Air Force's conclusion that at this time no scientific evidence has been presented to support the fact that UFOs are extraterrestrial.

I am anxiously awaiting your reply.

Sincerely,
Lazar Keitliner

August 24, 1967

Dear [redacted]

Reference your latest correspondence of August 3, 1967. We are still unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information.

The description you submitted could be that of a hot air balloon. Many individuals launch not at balloons, therefore, it would be impossible to determine whether one was in the area at the time of your observation.

The form you completed is a copy of an official Air Force form; however, we normally need additional information on any sighting. Before reacting, a definite conclusion, we recommend you contact the nearest Air Force Base immediately after a sighting. The case investigator is in a far better position to collect essential data. If he is unable to reach a positive identification, he will then send the report to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation. However, it is necessary to report, although delay.

We regret that you are unsatisfied with our present policy; however, if you desire to contact the investigator at Stewart Air Force Base in the future, I am sure he will be available.

Proposed reply to [redacted], letter August 3, 1967 (Sighting April 8, 1967)

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your latest correspondence of August 3, 1967. We still have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information.

A possible explanation would be that of a hot air balloon. The description you submitted is consistent with such an evaluation. There are many individuals who have launched hot air balloons; therefore, it would be impossible to determine whether a hot air balloon was positively in your area at the time of your observation.

The form you completed is a copy of an Official Air Force form; however, we normally need additional information on any sighting before reaching a definite conclusion. That is why an individual needs to contact the nearest Air Force base. The base investigator is in a far more desirable position to collect essential data, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, weather conditions, etc. It is his responsibility to collect and analyze all data pertinent to each sighting. If he is unable to reach a positive identification the report is then sent to the office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation, for final determination.

Since there was no indication in your report of a threat to the security of the United States, nor was there any indication of any scientific or technical data, the Air Force does not feel that further investigation into your sighting should be made.

OKLAHOMA CITY, SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1967 THE SUNDAY OKLAHOMAN

Flying Saucer? Nope, Flying Sign

It was a sign of the times - not
a flying saucer.

When Oklahoma City residents
saw something crossing the sky for
more than an hour Saturday night
they telephoned police and stared
into the sky.

A Cessna 172 airplane towing a
40-foot-long electric advertising
sign flew north to earth from 7:30
to 9 p.m. Saturday.

Telephone calls started soon after pilots Allen Mosley, 35, of 111
Kelley Dr., Moore, and William

Haynes, 35, of 406 NW 92, took to
the air with a 9-foot-high sign covered with white electric lights.

Oklahoma City's police department received the most calls
(more than 2-dozen). Other metropolitan police departments and
Will Rogers Post tower also received calls.

Police information officer J. D.
Burkhart received the first call
and mentioned a 12 or a skeptical re-

porter. The reporter walked up one
flight of stairs to the police dispatcher's office and found D. C.
Bowen also talking on the phone
about a flying saucer.

And then the phones really started ringing.

Most of the calls came from the
northwest Oklahoma City area.
"I saw it over my house," "near
my house," a man said. "My son
and I are watching it this second," an excited mother said in another

(Continued on Page 2, Column 1)

Flying Saucer?
No, Flying Sign
CONTINUED FROM PAGE ONE

conversation.
Most of the calls were met
with "I saw it," "What is
it?", "I saw it," "Wait a
minute, I'm not a nut."

Oklahoma City police via
telephone quickly learned
from Tinker's Rangoon (Radar) Approach Control) that the base was in radio contact
with the pilots who were with the advertising sign.

Police learned the pilots
had written permission from
the Federal Aviation Agency
two persons entered the
office station to give their
eye-witness account.

"I looked like a hamburger but with a bunch of lights in the middle of it,"
Oklahoma City, said. "There were
lights in the middle of it
where the meat would be
going 'blip, blip, blip'."

The pair said everyone
(about 50 persons) parked at
a downtown drive-in cafe
was out of the cars and looking upward. "One guy even
tried to follow it in his car,"
Mrs. Simmons said.

The pair, Tinker flight instructors, are the
men who fly the bannered
plane at the University of
Oklahoma's home football
games.

Mosley said their plane
flew from 65 to 85 miles per
hour at about 1500 feet. "We
flew over the field here several times to make sure people could read the sign at
that altitude," he said.

Asked if he was concerned about "startling anyone, but it is to attract
attention."

THE OKLAHOMA JOURNAL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 24, 1967

UFO Seen
In City

A Del City man reported
sighting a "flying saucer" in
the southwest skies over Oklahoma City Tuesday night.

Jim Misenheimer, 4125 SE
29, said the flying object had
the appearance of a billowing
parachute with "a bunch of
lights in line."

He said the lights pulsated
at five - second intervals as
the object circled in the
southwest skies, turned
south and reversed directions at least once.

Misenheimer said the object was first spotted by
Wilma Patrick, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Amos Patrick.
It was also observed by Mrs.
Misenheimer and Mr. and
Mrs. Patrick. The sighting
was at 9:22 p.m. and the object went out of sight about
10 or 12 minutes later, they
reported.

"I know it wasn't a plane,"
Misenheimer said.

OKLAHOMA CITY SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1967 THE SUNDAY OKLAHOMAN

Flying Saucer? Nope, Flying Sign

It was a sign of the times — not a flying saucer.

When Oklahoma City residents saw a mile-long crossing the sky for more than an hour Saturday night they learned police and state authorities had a simple explanation.

A Cessna 172 airplane towing a 65-foot advertising sign was flying north to south from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.

Telephone calls started soon after the Alvin Mosley, 55, of 111 King Dr., Moore, and William Hynes, 53, of 508 NW 92, took to the air with a 1500-ft. sign covered with white electric lights.

Oklahoma City's police department received the most calls (more than 2-dozen). Other metropolitan police departments also were phoned.

Air Force Base, Will Rogers World Airport tower and Wiley Post tower also received calls.

Police Information officer J. D. Burkhart received the first call and handled a skeptical re-

porter. The reporter walked up one flight of stairs to the police dispatcher's office and found D. C. Bowen also talking on the phone about a flying saucer.

And then the phone really started ringing.

Most of the calls came from the northwest Oklahoma City area. "The 'craft' was seen hovering over my house," a man said, "My son and I are watching it this second," an excited mother said in another.

(Continued on Page 2, Column 1)

Flying Saucer? No, Flying Sign
CONTINUED FROM PAGE ONE

Most of the calls were the same report, and were predictable. "What is this?" "I saw it, but I won't believe this," "Now I'm not a nut, but..."

Oklahoma City police via telephone quickly learned from Tinker's Rapcon (Radar Approach Control) that the sign was in radio contact with the pilots and it "all was an advertising gimmick."

Police learned the pilots had written permission from the Federal Aviation Agency several days ago.

Two persons entered the police station to give their explanation.

Like a giant kite without a tail, Mrs. Linda Simmons, 10, Oklahoma City, said, Miss Jean Rice, 14, said: "There were lights in the middle of it where the mat would be going 'blip, blip, blip'."

The pair was enlightened about the Cessna 172 and learned a little disappointed.

The pilots, both Tinker flight instructors, are the men who by the bantered plane at the University of Oklahoma's home football games.

Mosley said their plane flew from 65 to 85 miles per hour at about 1500 feet. "We flew over the field here several times to make sure people could read the sign at that altitude," he said.

Asked if he was concerned about triggering a mass saucer scare, Mosley said: "I hope it didn't scare anyone, but it is to attract attention."

I watched out of my friend's house about 910 pm (63-4-26) I looked up in the air and saw two airplanes one traveling west and the other west. The object was to the left of the airplane Richich were before it. As the plane advanced more west the object turned north and went over the airplane. It was hovering still the while it saw it. Let them proceed north until another airplane was to the right of it coming from the north east. The object went toward the airplane changing its direction to northeast. It went over it and set or went until it came to a complete stop. Something occurred out of the bottom from a smaller object 13 of its size. It came out about 10 ft from the bottom and it also stopped. Then they did other things I can't read/understand.

I was leaving my house and just as I stepped off my back porch I noticed this red-white color changing light. I called my mother and ran upstairs while she watched it. I got my binoculars and got a short look at the object just before it went behind the hill. It appeared the same as it did to the eye. I then later it disappeared from Maple Ave to see it again which I didn't. I have counted out airplane because it moved to slowly and helicopter because a helicopter that close would make a hell of a lot of noise.

Proposed reply to [redacted] letter August 3, 1967 (Sighting April 8, 1967)

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your latest correspondence of August 3, 1967. We still have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information.

A possible explanation would be that of a hot air balloon. The description you submitted is consistent with such an evaluation.

There are many individuals who have launched hot air balloons, therefore, it would be impossible to determine whether a hot air balloon was positively in your area at the time of your observation.

The form you completed is a copy of an Official Air Force Form; however, we normally need additional information on any sighting before reaching a definite conclusion. That is why an individual needs to contact the nearest Air Force base. The base investigator is in a far more desirable position to collect essential data such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, weather conditions, etc. It is his responsibility to collect and analyze all data pertinent to each sighting. If he is unable to reach a positive identification the report is then sent to the office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation for a final determination.

Since there was no indication in your report, of a threat to the security of the United States, nor was there any indication of any new scientific or technical data, the Air Force does not feel that further investigation into your sighting should be made.

Attn: Lt. Colonel Barnett B. Young

Dear [redacted]:

This is a reply to your letter explaining your observation of an unidentified flying object.

In that letter you stated that my observation could not be thoroughly investigated due to insufficient data. You stated that flight characteristics, maneuvers, angular velocities etc. are essential for proper investigation.

If you check the form I submitted to Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson AFB, you will clearly see the data I described. Flight characteristics and answers pertaining to this subject are explaining this characteristic of flight.

I filled out all the questions accurately, as well as including a two page narrative of my experience. I am connected with a UFO organization which supports the Air Force stand that there is no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial. I am very familiar with this mystery. And I can say that I have eliminated all of the common explanations from the planet Venus to ion plasm. To me, receiving a letter stating insufficient data is unacceptable.

I am sure that if you wished, this case could be investigated. I cannot accept this because I know that the Air Force has the means to investigate every case.

If my report was lacking in information why was I not contacted immediately so I could supply the information? I am sure you will not overlook this case again, and will contact me as soon as you come to a plausible conclusion.

I can now see why many people become angry with the Air Force after receiving such a letter... as Chief of the Community Relations Division, you realize, I believe, that there are those that would only antagonize a citizen who is truly searching for an answer to his case but is left "hanging in the air."

I would like for my case to be reexamined. I would like to contact Lt. Stewart AFB, New York concerning this case unless you think it is too late for this since a few months have passed.

Sincerely,

Proposed reply to Letter from [redacted] (Sighting: Apr 4, 1967)

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This replies to your recent letter in which you requested information on your unidentified observation of April 4, 1967.

We have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information. Essential data such as flight characteristics, angular velocities, maneuvers, etc., are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation could have been possible. The UFO investigator, at your nearest military installation, is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

If you should ever witness another strange phenomena in our atmosphere, contact the UFO investigator at Stewart AFB, New York.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and appears to be a detailed description of a UFO encounter. Due to the handwritten nature and some parts being slightly illegible, I'll transcribe what I can clearly read:]

[First paragraph describes some details about time, location, and initial observations]

I checked the weather, moon & stars. I didn't write until later but a man had come out of his house to watch. I am including his name in this report without permission. All particles were feeling from the action of the UFO. These particles were only visible a few seconds after being dropped, but they kept coming one after another. Estimating this was 20-30" particles. Interesting sometimes the UFO did not change particles was not visible after the UFO dropped away. We tried to find out more about the entire incident which took about 5 minutes. I have possibilities, eliminated certain & have knowledge of UFOs.

[At the bottom of the page, there is a footnote marked with (1) which appears to read:]

(1) The particles may have reflected the light of the UFO. That may be the reason we saw them only for a second or two.

Sirs:

Has the Air Force reached a conclusion pertaining to my sighting? 
My UFO questionnaire to Wright Patterson AFB during the month of April this year.

I was under the impression that a representative of the Air Force would contact me to discuss my case. This has not been done.

If you have reached a conclusion please notify me of the results. I am very interested in UFOs and as head of a UFO organization. We support the Air Force's conclusions that at this time no scientific evidence has been presented to support the idea that UFOs are extraterrestrial.

I am anxious, awaiting your reply,

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out with scribbled lines]
