To whom it may concern,

One night while my wife and I were sitting on the front porch in the evening, at 9:45 PM, we saw a flying object pass south of us going East & West. Other street, mostly West Street as on a direct line, north and south. This object was shaped like an 30° angled, was too high to be the exhaust from a jet, a/c's, was lit up so the whole object looked like hovering, magnesium, whitish light blue, and there was flame from first to rear and the object which looked like it was maybe 0 1/2 ft. in diameter, and over all about 4 ft. or more long, moving very level thru the sky, at about 4-5 thousand feet, maybe as it seemed. A thousand feet might be the Proctor life defense. It was in view and at silence at the start of my three...

There is a postage stamp in the top left corner of the document.

Some text at the bottom left is partially illegible due to poor image quality.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDSN
SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (blacked out)

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs. Gaiser)

Reference the attached letter from (blacked out), Mason, Ohio. The object observed by (blacked out) and his wife during July 1964, is characteristic of a meteor observation. The description is consistent with that of hundreds of similar reports of confirmed meteor sightings. While the duration was not reported, the speed of three times that of a jet aircraft indicates that the sighting was very brief.

It is requested that (blacked out) be informed of our evaluation.

The object you both observed is characteristic of a meteor observation. The description is consistent with that of hundreds of similar reports of confirmed meteor sightings. While the duration was not reported, the speed of travel times that of a jet aircraft indicated that the sighting was very brief.
