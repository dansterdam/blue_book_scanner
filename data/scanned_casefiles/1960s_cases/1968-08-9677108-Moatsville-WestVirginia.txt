The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a form labeled "AFR 80-17(C1)" that seems to be requesting information about a UFO sighting.

The text on the form includes questions about the observer's experiences, such as whether they used binoculars or reading glasses, whether they noticed any physical effects, and whether they were able to obtain a clear picture of the object. The form also has sections for the observer to describe the object they saw and any other relevant information.

This image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The top sketch appears to be a compass or navigational diagram, with labels indicating cardinal directions. The lower sketches depict landscapes, with one showing a person standing on a road or path surrounded by hilly terrain, and the other showing a more panoramic view of a horizon with hills or mountains in the distance.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE AS AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION VIEWED. CONSIDERING POSITION OBSERVED, PLACE A POINT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH LIGHT SEEMED TO COME. PLACE A Y ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH OBJECT SEEMED TO MOVE.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, MAKE SKETCHES TO ILLUSTRATE POSITIONS AS SEEN APPROXIMATELY FROM THE GROUND. THESE MAY GIVE SOME IDEA OF 
THE ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT ABOVE THE HORIZON AND ALSO INDICATE ITS APPARENT SIZE IN RELATION TO SURROUNDING TERRAIN FEATURES. THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image contains two photographs. The main image is a compass rose with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a UFO phenomenon. The other two smaller images are illustrations of a person standing on a road surrounded by hills or mountains.

6.A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON AS IT LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS ERRATIC, STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.
