10. CONCLUSION
UNIDENTIFIED

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
2-3 minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
An illuminated "object", glowing and very bright
in the center, with a great many white lights
bordering the glow, approached the witnesses
from the southeast, descending at a 45 deg. angle.
The "craft" or lights were rotating in a counter-
clockwise direction. Object made noise at first
like helicopter--then silent when close by. The
two boys were frightened and took refuge in the
hay barn after two or three minutes. They claim
most likely "possibly at object" based only on
evidence given, and unless boy's evidence is very
largely discounted, cause of sighting is not
known. No aircraft in vicinity.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
G-Visual

7. COURSE
From S.E.

8. PHOTOS
Yes
No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Yes
No

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                25 JUNE 1968

Subj: UFO Observation, 19 June 1968

Called Disaster Control W-P. AFB.
Mr. [redacted] said that he really couldn't say too much since he didn't know what type of counter was being used but did say that concentrations of 100-10,000 disintegrations/min./sq. centimeter requires the use of a gas mask. He suggested that I contact [redacted], the base Health Physics Officer or have local H.P. Officer measure with STAPLEX. Called [redacted] office[redacted] and was referred to No. 76231 where he was at the time. Mr. [redacted] stated that without information such a background count and type of instrument (including Army Navy Portable Detector No.) he really couldn't say if the radiation was hazardous or not.

Suggested that I call the base/and have Base Health Physics Officer accompany and make measurements on count.

If that is impossible find out:
1. If instrument is properly calibrated.
2. If Capt. Leonard is familiar with the use of the instrument.
3. Type and make of instrument (including ANPDR #).
4. Background count.
5. If they are getting reading from
   A. An object
   B. General Area
6. If object, take several readings at various distances from object.
7. If area, take several measurements at various distances from the area.


- page 2 -

8. Take a reading with the window of counter open and closed at each point.

9. If object, see if radiation is transferrable. Rub paper towel (folded) remove from area and see if towel now is radioactive. If radiation is transferrable, shower immediately after leaving area and wear rubber gloves when working in area.

Mr. Lewis wants us to call him back.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                21 June 1968

Subj: UFO Observation & Investigation, 19 June 1968

At 0920 hours Lt Carmon Marano, Aerial Phenomena Office, telephoned Captain Leonard at Clinton Sherman AFB, Oklahoma. Capt Leonard was not in at the time and Lt Marano's call was transferred to extension 6208, MSgt Towne. The only thing that Sgt Towne knew about the observation was what was in the TWX. He said that Capt Leonard had done the investigation. Lt Marano asked Sgt Towne to have Capt Leonard call Lt Marano since he, Lt M, needed the following information. What type of radiac instrument was he using? The Register #? If it has been calibrated lately? Was he familiar with the instrument? Were the readings from the background of the area? Did he take the readings from a particular object or from the general area? Lt Marano requested that Sgt Towne return Lt Marano's call if Capt Leonard would be unable to be reached in one and one-half hours. Sgt Towne said he would have Capt Leonard call Lt Marano and that he would return the call if Capt Leonard could not be reached.

Subj: UFO Observation, 19 June 1968

Lt Downey called on 21 June 1968 at 1135 hrs to say that disaster control had checked the area and that there is only normal background activity. I asked Lt Downey to check local police, state police, and local at Hobart, Cordell etc. and see if they received any reports.

See if local radars tracked anything either identified or unidentified at or near the time of the sighting. I also asked him to transmit all the above information (including statement that there was no abnormal radio activity in the areas) to us. I also told him that in the future they should also transmit a TWX to the University of Colorado in accordance to 80-17A but that I would do it for this case.

1. Under the provisions of AFR 80-17, Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects, an investigation was made on 19 June through 15 July 1968, at Clinton Sherman AFB and 4 miles South & 2 miles East of Dill City (Oklahoma), by Captain George S. Leonard Jr., 70th Bomb Wing SAC (USAF) Clinton Sherman AFB, Oklahoma 73632, to examine all aspects of the allegation made by 2 farm hands that a UFO was sighted by them at approximately 0430 hours, 19 June 1968.

2. The investigation is supported by accompanying pictures, letters of certification and AFR 80-17 (C1) questionnaires on sighting of unidentified phenomena, from personal interview of the 2 farm hands by Captain Leonard, at the sight of the phenomenon. A radioactivity check was made of the area with negative results. Verification from all agencies in the local area revealed only one aircraft in the area.

3. Conclusions reached by my limited knowledge in this investigation are inconclusive. The only determination of cause I would suggest is a combination of freak weather and a straying from course route by the small aircraft in the area.

I was appointed investigating officer on the afternoon of 19 June 1968 for a UFO sighting that occurred between 0430 and 0500 hours that morning on a farm approximately 10 miles SSE of Clinton Sherman Air Base that belongs to Mr [redacted] of Dill City, Okla. Mrs. [redacted]'s son[redacted] and his cousin[redacted] witnessed the sighting while they were unloading hay from a truck into a barn behind the farmhouse. Information received by [redacted] this station approximately 1530 hours 19 June.

I made contact at 0800 hours the 20th with SSGT Woods, [redacted] of Clinton-Sherman AFB Base Operations and obtained assistance in calling local agencies dealing with aircraft and surrounding air bases. Mr [redacted] of Hobart Radio Flight Service Station was talked to and he said he had a Piper Aztec at 4500' at 1003Z over Sayre on V272 to Oklahoma City VOR. AIC Reiff from Base Operations at Altus AFB stated he had no traffic in the area operational between 0930Z and 1000Z on the 19th. Mr [redacted] at Fort Sill operations says he had no traffic in the area at the time of the sighting and was asked specifically if he had helicopters operating....answer negative.

Mr [redacted] and Mr [redacted] on duty in Operations at Tinker AFB, OKLA. at the time said there was no traffic in our vicinity at the time of the sighting. A weather synopsis was made by Clinton Sherman Weather Office and is attached as well as the Fort Worth Center Radar report. At approximately 1000 hours t.e 20th,

I made a field survey with Disaster Control of the sight and interviewed the 2 individuals and took the attached photos of the area. Disaster control found no radioactivity after they returned to base and calibrated their instruments with PNSL and then returned to the site. A TWX was sent out to Wright Patterson on the afternoon of the 20th, and this follow-up report of formal investigation is forwarded for further analysis at your discretion. I can determine no cause for the sighting with information I have corroborated.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

AFR 80-17, 19 September 1966, is changed as follows:

*3c. Investigation. Each commander of an
Air Force base within the United States will
provide a UFO . . . sighting for action.

EXCEPTIONS: FTD at Wright-Patter-
son . . . for separate investigations. The Uni-
versity of Colorado, under a research agree-
ment with the Air Force, will conduct a study
of UFOs. This program (to run approxi-
mately 15 months) will be conducted inde-
pendently and without restrictions. The
university will enlist the assistance of other
conveniently located institutions that can field
investigative teams. All UFO reports will be
submitted to the University of Colorado,
which will be given the fullest cooperation of
all UFO Investigating Officers. Every effort
will be made to keep all UFO reports un-
classified. However, if it is necessary to
classify a report because of method of detec-
tion or other factors not related to the UFO,
a separate report including all possible infor-
mation will be sent to the University of
Colorado.

*6a. The Deputy Chief of Staff, . . . reported
within the United States. Air Air Force ac-
tivities within the United States will conduct
UFO . . . investigation with FTD.

UFO Observation, 19 June 1968

Airport
Weeping Water, Nebraska 68463

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Rocky, Oklahoma, which occurred on 19 June 1968. (Rocky is about 10 miles north of Hobart)

2. Although the sighting occurred sometime between 4:15 and 5:00 am, Central Daylight Time, the description is very similar to that of an electrical aerial advertising sign. It was determined that Hobart Radio Flight Service Station had a Piper Aztec at 4500' at 1003Z over Sayre on V272 to Oklahoma City, VFR.

3. Since you own a Piper Aztec, we were wondering if your plane could have been in the area and possibly turned its lights on several minutes, thus causing the UFO sighting. If your plane was not in the area, do you know of any unusual aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

Report of call to the Boys-Sighting at Rocky, Oklahoma.
Date of Sighting: 19 June, 1968

A call was placed to on Tuesday, September, 17, 1968, in Rocky, Oklahoma.

Operator: Can come to the phone?
Answer: is here.

Operator: Can we talk to him? Long distance calling. Is this Brent?
Yes.

Operator: Go ahead, please.

Hynek: Hello, this is Prof. Hynek at Northwestern University. Did you get my letter?
Yes.

Hynek: Fine.

not down here any more. He's in college.

Hynek: As I said in the letter, I am very much interested in your sighting and I wonder if you could answer a few questions about it?
I'll try.

Hynek: Which one are you, the younger or the older?
I'm the younger. Jerry is not here because he is in college.

Hynek: Is he your cousin?
Yes, he is my cousin.

Hynek: Where is he in college?
In western Oklahoma.

Hynek: Well, okay then. As long as I've got you on the line I might as well talk with you, and I can call Jerry later. This all happened on June 19, 1968, is that right? So it is not too far back. What first called your attention to it?
It sounded like a helicopter at first. I guess that is why I looked up at first.

Hynek: So why don't we just do it this way. You take a deep breath and let's go over the whole thing. Pretend it is happening all over again and just describe what you saw.
Well, when I first looked up there was noise here but then I heard the noise quit.

Hynek: How bright was it?

It was all lit up. There were lights all around it, and in a few minutes it disappeared.

Hynek: Did you ever see anything like it before?
No, I never did.

Hynek: If you held your hand out in front of you, how much of the object would it have covered, or would your thumbnail have covered it?
Oh, well, not very much.

Hynek: Well, it was really very big then?
Pretty big.

Hynek: Did it ever pass in front of anything or in back of anything?
Well, let's see, it came over the barn but I don't believe it passed right in front of anything or in back of anything.

Hynek: How high would you have to raise your arm to point directly at it when it was at its highest?
Not too high.

Hynek: So it was fairly close to the horizon then?
Pretty close.

Hynek: Did it have sharp edges or did it have fuzzy edges?
Quite sharp.

Hynek: What was the color of the light?
Just white lights.

Hynek: Did it ever change color?
No, not at all.

Hynek: Now, if you had a tractor light, or an automobile headlight in front of you, how far would you have to be from the light to have it about the same brightness? About a block, or something like that?
About a block or two blocks maybe. It wasn't too big.

Hynek: How would it compare in size to the moon, the full moon, for instance.
About the same size, I'd say. The whole object you mean?

Hynek: Yes, the whole object. What impressed you most about it, what was the thing that grabbed you the most?
The brightness of it.

Hynek: What did you think it was?
I didn't know what it was. It scared me at first.

Hynek: Do you think it could have been a balloon, or something like that.

54


- page 57 -

No, it was not balloon or nothing like that. It was all lit up and there was noise at first and than it quit.

Hynek: How close do you think it got to you?

I would say between 50 and 100 feet. But there were no trees around so you could judge its actual distance.

Hynek: No, there were no trees.

Yes, that's right. I have the pictures in front of me and it is pretty flat out there, isn't it? How many people did you tell about this?

We didn't tell nobody right then. After that we told quite a few.

Hynek: What did they say, what did they think about it. Did they think you were nuts or something?

Actually, we didn't tell nobody after that.

Hynek: How long before you decided not to tell anybody?

The next day after that.

Hynek: I am always interested in knowing what people think about sightings and about a person who has seen something like this. How did you happen to make the report in the first place?

We thought it was helicopters at first from the Quentin Air Force Base so we called and they said there was no helicopters up then.

Hynek: Did they say they had anything on radar?

No, they said there was no airplanes or nothing out that night.

Hynek: What was the sky itself like, was it clear? Or, was it cloudy?

Clear, I believe.

Hynek: Was the moon up?

Yes, there was some moon.

Hynek: What part of the sky was the moon in?

I don't remember about that.

Hynek: Well, was it high up or was it low down?

Fairly high.

Hynek: Well, let me ask, was the moon in the same part of the sky as this object?

No, it wasn't.

Hynek: And you were looking what -- west?

No, we were looking east. It came from the southeast.


- page 58 -

Hynek: How long did the whole thing last?
About three or four minutes.

Hynek: And in what way did it disappear?
Well, I don't know, it just disappeared. We were looking at it and it was gone.

Hynek: You mean it went out like a light bulb?
It just went out.

Hynek: Could you actually make out any outlines or was the light so bright that you couldn't make out any outlines?
I couldn't tell about any edge or anything, it was just round.

Hynek: Did the light go all over the edges?
It looked like it did.

Hynek: So if there was any actual object there, you probably couldn't have seen it. Is that right?
I guess not.

Hynek: So as far as you are concerned, it was basically a light?
Is that right?
Yes, with lights all around it.

Hynek: Do you have any idea how many lights? Were you frightened at all?
Well, right at first, I didn't know what it was. I saw my cousin out there and he seen it.

Hynek: Did it have any effect on the animals?
Well, the dog started barking. I didn't notice anything about the cows, but the dogs started barking.

Hynek: Well, do you think they were barking at it or something else.
I don't know, but that was the only thing around to bark at.

Hynek: What did your parents think about all this when you told them?
Well, it kind of scared them. They didn't know what to think about it.

Hynek: Had they ever seen anything like it?
No.

Hynek: You don't know of anyone else who saw it that night?
No, I guess there weren't many people up at 4 o'clock in the morning.

Hynek: How come you were up that early?
We were hauling hay.

Here is the text from the document:

Hynek: I see. Is there anything else about it you think I really ought to know?

[Redacted]: I believe that is about all.

Hynek: Did it ever actually stop still for awhile?

[Redacted]: Well, it stopped for about a second and then it moved, and then it moved on around the barn.

Hynek: Well, now, how long did the sound last and how long was it silent?

[Redacted]: Well, let's see, it lasted, I did would say, about 30 seconds and then 2 or 3 minutes silence.

Hynek: I haven't the least idea what it was that you saw, but there have been other reports like it. We are trying to figure out what it is.

[Redacted]: You don't have any idea what it was?

Hynek: No, I don't. I don't know what it could be.

Hynek: How many of your friends your own age did you tell about it?

[Redacted]: Pretty near everybody knew about it afterwards.

Hynek: Did the papers get hold of it?

[Redacted]: No, they never did get hold of it.

Hynek: That's good.

[Redacted]: But some woman put it in the paper, but we never did.

Hynek: Well, thanks very much for the information, and you say that is at college right now? What town is the University of Southwestern Oklahoma in?

[Redacted]: Weatherford, Oklahoma.

Hynek: You don't happen to have his address, do you?

[Redacted]: Well, you know the other number you had in the report, well, that's his.

Hynek: I'll give him a ring there and see if I can find him.

[Redacted]: Well, he ought to be home right now.

Hynek: All right, I'll give him a ring and see what happens. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

Hynek: I'd like to put in a person-to-person call to Mr. [Redacted] located in Weatherford, Oklahoma, and the number is [Redacted]. I don't know the area code.

Operator: Hello, is Mr. [Redacted] there? Long distance is calling.

Hynek: Hello, Mr. [Redacted]. University city calling. I think you may have gotten a letter from me, or your cousin, [Redacted] did. Well, anyway, you know what I am calling up about, I just talked with Brent. I had a nice long talk with him, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions.


- page 60 -

Yes, I'll be happy to.

Hynek: Can you speak up a little louder because I can hardly hear you? Now, let's see, did this object make any noise?

Yes, it did. First, it sounded like a helicopter approaching.

Hynek: And how long did that last?

I think it was altogether about five minutes.

Hynek: I mean did the sound last that long?

The sound - uh huh.

Hynek: And was there any time it didn't have the sound?

After a while, the helicopter sound turned into more of a whine than a roar.

Hynek: So, it was noisy all the time?

Yes, Sir.

Hynek: Now, it seemed to indicate that it was noisy for only about 30 seconds. Than, he said that it didn't make any noise.

Well, I heard it longer than that for sure. I believe I heard it for a good while.

Hynek: How did you first happen to see it?

He happened to see it first, and he come back and he was scared. I didn't know what was going on.

Hynek: Did he looked scared?

Yeah, he was scared, he was real scared. That's the reason I went out there to see what he was scared about.

Hynek: Well, tell you what, let's do it this way. Let's take it from the point where first called your attention to it and you tell me in your own words now just what happened. It's probably a lot easier than my asking you separate questions.

After he saw it?

Hynek: Yes. And after you saw it first then.

Well, I popped out and he headed for back of the barn. I just happened to glance up in that direction and I seen the object.

Hynek: Well, what did you think it was?

I thought maybe at first it was just an airplane. I didn't know. I was shocked, too. I didn't know a saucer or what.

Hynek: You thought maybe it was a saucer?

Well, I think it was. Yeah, I know it was.

Hynek: Okay, I am not questioning you, I just want to get a description. Now let's get at how big it seemed to be. How did it compare in size to the full moon?

57


- page 61 -

Here is the text from the document:

(Pause) When it was quite aways off it seemed pretty small. When it got close enough you could tell it was fairly large.
Hynek: Well, I know you can't estimate how big it really was since you don't know how far away it was, but anyway, how far away do you think it was, when it was the closest?

When it was close, it was pretty big, and I couldn't say anything about it.

Hynek: Now _____ seemed to indicate that it never got very high in the sky and that it was always close to the horizon. Is that correct?

Well, when I first saw it was pretty high, and it was coming at an angle towards us, and then it got high up when it left, and I never did see it leave.

Hynek: How come you never saw it leave?

Well, I thought it was going to crash or something, and I headed back into the barn, too.

Hynek: Oh, I see, so both of you headed into the barn?

Well, yes, sir, that's right.

Hynek: I don't blame you at all, I probably would have been scared, too. What color was it?

Well, it was just luminous white.

Hynek: Oh, yes. How many people did you tell about it, and what did they think about it when you told them?

Well, the first thing I did while it was there- so we had to tell somebody, so we told the guy we worked for. We was pretty shook up, but he was just laughing about it a little bit.
(Tape bad at this point -------)

Hynek: Have you ever seen anything like this before?

Never have.

Hynek: Would you want to?

Now that it happened I would sort of like to have a picture just to prove that I saw it.

Hynek: Well, that would be awfully nice of course.

A lot of people don't believe me.

Hynek: In the report I didn't get a picture of the object. I do have the photographs _____ barn and the general landscape, but I never did get a drawing of the object itself. Do you think you could sketch it out on a piece of paper and send it to me. The address here is very simple. It is simply the Astronomy Department Northwestern Un., Evanston, Ill. My name is spelled Hynek. I wish you would because I would like to see it, and also, let me have any other things that you might think of later. Let me see if there is anything else I would like to ask right now. Let's see, what was the sky like, was it clear, or was it cloudy?

Well, it was partly cloudy in the west and clear in the east.

Hynek: Was the moon out?

The moon was out, I believe, a little bit, and I believe it

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Hynek: The reason I asked I just wanted to see how it compared in
size. Now, as far as brightness is concerned, if you took
an automobile headlight, let's say, how far away would you
have to put it so that it would have the same brightness
as this object had? A car light, or tractor light, or
something like that.

Well, it wasn't bright enough to blind you or anything like
that. It was just lit up.

Hynek: Was it dim enough so that you could make out anything that
the light was attached to.

Well, I seen it, and it had lots of lights on the outside,
and the middle was sort of glowing.

Hynek: About how many lights were there altogether?

Just a lot, I really couldn't know how many.

Hynek: Okay, Well, did it ever really stand still at any time?

Well, not more than just a couple of seconds.

Hynek: How close do you think it was to the ground when it was the
closest?

Well, there was a telephone pole out there and it seemed
to be just right ovet that.

Hynek: What impressed you most about the whole thing?

Well, I guess the fact that it wasn't an airplane. It was
some other object.

Hynek: Now, when you did tell other people, did they believe you
or did they kid you about it?

Well, the fellows that come out checked around for radiation,
you know, and they were pretty nice about it, but everybody
else seemed to think we were just making it up to get some
publicity.

Hynek: How did it get to the attention of the Air Force?

I told my mom about it the next morning and asked her if
she heard anything about it, you know, to sort of back me
up, and that set her off, and she called up there and told
them about it.

Hynek: Who came out to see you?

Somebody from the Air Force base came out.

Hynek: And is he the one who took the pictures?

Yes, he took the pictures and asked the questions.

Hynek: I'm glad he did and I'm glad he treated you nicely. Well,
I guess there is nothing too much more I can ask you.

I'll think it over a little more and try to draw what I saw.

Hynek: Yes, I wish you would, and send it to me, and you might have
some other things you did would like to add - after all, it
has been several months now.-

Yeah, I know. I never heard anything about it and I just figured that nobody cared anything about it.

Hynek: No, we do care about it, but there is a great deal of work to do. You have many address, don't you, to send the stuff to. I'd appreciate you sending this to very much because we are doing our best to try and track these things down and trying to find out what it is all about.

Well, I'll tell you what, the way the guys acted out here, I thought maybe they had something up they weren't telling us about.

Hynek: No, I don't believe that was the case.

Well, that is the way they acted.

Hynek: You mean the guys from the Air Force?

Yeah.

Hynek: Let me ask you one other thing. How long would you say you were really a frightened by the thing? Did it affect your sleep or your dreams or anything like that?

Well, it really shook us up for about two weeks. I've been having trouble getting to sleep. I believe in them now, I didn't before until I saw it.

Hynek: Have you done much reading about UFOs?

I sure have since then. And, I'm going to take some astronomy.

Hynek: Well, That's good, maybe we will see you here at Northwestern sometime. Who can tell. Well, fine, keep up your interest in astronomy and please do get that sketch to me as soon as you can.

Okay, you'll be getting it right soon. Thanks for calling.
