through a field behind their house, just at twilight. Mrs. Baker said that she
looked out her window and saw a round ball (with a pinkish light) that almost
blinded her. It hovered outside her kitchen window, less than six feet away,
and then moved around the area of the house and across the road. They live

THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN
The A.P.R.O. Bulletin is the official copyrighted publication of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (A.P.R.O.), 4145 E. Desert Place, Tucson, Arizona, an incorporated non-profit group dedicated to the eventual solution of the mystery of the unidentified objects which have been present in the skies for hundreds of years. Inquiries regarding membership may be made to the above address.

TUCSON, ARIZONA - NOVEMBER, 1962

GLOWING LIGHTS INVADE HOME

On Pampas Drive, which connects with Spring Park Road, an unidentified woman (by request) said a formless "glow" moved through her house, out through the iron roof and along Pampas Drive.

She said it was about a half a block long, and brilliantly illuminated a car and other objects in the vicinity. She said that as the glow moved through the house, it enveloped her, her hand tingled, "as if it had gone to sleep" and her children screamed through fear.

Mrs. Gladys Pauette of Cascade Road, the street from which Mrs. Rakers' fire-ball seemed to come, said she saw a glow descend to within 3 feet of the ground between her home and the adjacent house. She said the form was too vague to be described as ball-shaped, but she called it a "terribly big brilliance." She said the circuit which carried electricity to her bathroom was knocked out about this time, and was still out the next morning.

On the 10th of October, residents on Spring Park Road, Jacksonville, Florida, observed strange small, incredible fireball arrivals which had fuzzy outlines and stole silently around and among houses on that street.

Numerous lights dimmed and some went out entirely as the phenomena occurred. Mrs J. P. Baker said she was in her upstairs window at twilight when her husband told her he had seen a ball of fire moving through a field behind the house.

Mrs. Baker looked out her kitchen window and saw a "round ball, big as a No. 2 wash tub" which was pinkish in color and so brilliant it almost blinded her. She said it hovered outside her kitchen window apparently less than 6 feet away, then drifted around the corner of the house and cross Spring Park Road. Haroldson Road and other witnesses along a utility wire saw a fireball gliding along a company. "It was the size of a washub, a blinding, whitish ball of fire. I watched it about five seconds. It moved about 10 or 20 feet during that time, then went out with a big "pop". Our lights were dim for about a half hour after," Whitehead reported.

Akron, Ohio-Oct 10, 1962
A mother and daughter looking into the west saw what appeared to be a twin sun to the left, and in line with the sun. The light was slightly smaller than the sun. It persisted for about 15-20 minutes. The sky was clear-no explanation. Probably Prof. Menzel could explain this one.

North Canton, Oct 11, 1962
A husband and wife who live near the airport saw a large lighted oblong or cigar-
shaped object moving at extremely slow speed from 3 to W in the northern sky. Gar-
est point was at 20° elev. at its height. Below this lighted object, red and white
lights seemed to appear irregularly and singly. The oblong object was larger than
airplane lights. The object traveled through 50° azimuth in 15min. It passed be-
hind trees where the red lights continued to be seen. No sound. The size was
compared to a dime at arm's length. Both declared that they knew the blimp when they
saw it. "This wasn't it," they said. The Goodyear A.C. blimp was flying that night.

was seen in the sky over the Buchan area
this weekend. It was reported to have

massive thing and it travelled very fast.
It was clearly defined and was certainly

During the evening of October 14th, I heard from a serviceman in Formosa, Argentina, saw a group of people coming out from a service home in town. An object in the sky caught their eyes to look at it. The UFO made a light so bright that it must have been brightly at some distance away, but the group was too frightened to analyze. Afterwards, the object was seen by several others in the vicinity.

ASTRONOMY                                                                Science News Letter for September 22, 1962

Venus at Greatest Brilliance
Venus will reach its maximum brilliance and the fifth of the naked-eye planets, Mercury, will come into view in the October sky, James Stokley reports.

> THE PLANET VENUS, which has been so prominent in the western evening sky for the past few months, will reach maximum brilliance on Oct. 8.

This is her last fling, however, for by the end of October, Venus will have virtually disappeared from the evening sky in the sun's direction.

Three other planets—Saturn, Jupiter and Mars—are also visible in the evening. And Mercury, the fifth of the naked-eye planets, will come into view before sunrise about Oct. 21.

Only Saturn and Jupiter are shown on the accompanying maps, which give the appearance of the skies about ten o'clock (your own kind of standard time) at the beginning of October, an hour earlier in the middle of the month and two hours earlier at the end. Venus sets too early, and Mars rises too late to be shown.

Venus Visible in Daylight
Venus sets about an hour and a half after the sun on Oct. 1. Even then it is practically as bright as it will be on the 8th—almost as bright as the astronomical magnitude of -4.3. It can be seen with another planet, or any star. It is visible long before the others, while the sky is still quite bright.

In fact, Venus can be seen even while the sun is in the sky, using a standard field glass, direct sunlight, and know just where to look.

Jupiter's magnitude in October is minus 2.3. Although this is less than a sixth as bright as Venus, it is still about 15 times brighter than Saturn. And even that planet equals a bright first magnitude star. Jupiter is well up in the southeast, in the constellation of Aquarius, the water carrier, and it sets about two hours after midnight.

Saturn is to the right, lower, in Capricornus, the sea-goat.

Mars, the reddish planet, is a little dimmer than Saturn, is in Gemini, and a little before midnight. Red in color, it is easy to identify.

Among the stars, the brightest is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, which is high in the northwest. Directly below Vega is Deneb, in Cygnus, the swan. Altair, in Aquila, the eagle, shines to the left of Deneb, and is shown on the map for the southern sky.

Over in the northeast is another first magnitude star—Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer. It is well up in the sky, with Aldebaran. This star is red in color, and about the same brightness as Mars which comes up later.

They need not be confused, however: Aldebaran shines with the scintillating bril-

Cassiopeia, to the right, and the father of Andromeda, above.

Cepheus is not a brilliant constellation; none of its stars is as bright as the first magnitude. But in this group is a star of the second magnitude which is quite conspicuous very important to astronomers.

This is delta Cephei, the easternmost of a little triangle of stars in the upper part of the constellation. It is the prototype of a class of stars known as variable stars, which astronomers have found to be valuable in measuring such things as the size of the universe.

Delta Cepheid a Variable Star
Delta Cephi is a variable star. From a maximum of magnitude 3.8, it drops in about four days to 4.3, about two-thirds as bright. In about a day and a half it returns to its maximum brightness; the total period of the cycle is 5.4 days.

Apparently it is pulsating. While it is expanding it is brightest, and when it is most rapidly contracting it is faintest. When at maximum brightness, it is more bluish, which indicates an increase in temperature of about 3,600 degrees.

Cepheid, like most stars, utilize nuclear energy to supply their energy to produce, in which hydrogen is converted to helium. According to one theory, the star contracts and this heats up its core, thus firing up the nuclear furnace that keeps it going.

size, the internal temperature goes down and the nuclear furnace reduces its output. This is further away. The relation between period and luminosity occurs here and over.

Delta Cephei, with a period of 5.4 days, has a mean magnitude of four. This, however, is its apparent magnitude—how bright it looks—which depends partly on its distance. A faint star nearby may outshine a brilliant one that is further away.

So to compare the intrinsic luminosity—the candlepower of a star, we use absolute magnitude, which is what they would be if all were at a standard distance. The mean luminous of Cepheid 2 is about minus 2; it is some 660 times more luminous than the sun.

For a Cepheid that goes through its cycle in a day, the mean absolute magnitude would be minus 0.5, while one with a 20-day period would be ten times as bright.

Cepheids are usually recognized from the way their light changes—brightening rapidly, dimming more slowly. Then the period of a Cepheid is measured, in days and fractions of a day. The relation between period and luminosity tells how bright the star really is (on the average), you can see how bright it looks in the sky. Knowing the effect of distance on brightness, how far away it is can be calculated.

Thus Cepheid variable stars are important tools in measuring vast distances. Their use has been complicated in recent years as astronomers found that not all of them are alike, as they had formerly assumed. This meant that some of the distant galaxies—huge systems of stars like the whole Milky Way system, of which the earth is a part—were more than twice as far as they had formerly believed.

That is the way science advances, however: one man observes an effect and arrives at a conclusion. Then comes another who defines it, ever getting closer and closer to ultimate truth.

TECHNOLOGY
Air-Insulated "Balloon"
Communications Cable

COMMUNICATIONS cable that looks
like linked miniature balloons has been an-
nounced by Superior Cable Corporation,
Hickory, N. C. and Simplex Wire & Cable
Company, Cambridge, Mass. The technique
was imported from France.

The "balloon" design, as it is known
throughout Europe, makes possible "im-
proved transmission combined with excep-
tional mechanical strength and anticipated
economy over existing coaxial and telephonic
cable." The cable is now available to
the announcement said.

Widespread application is expected, ac-
cording to both Simplex and Superior, for
carrying all kinds of information electron-
ically, whether voice, pictures or data.

Among volume markets viewed are: tele-
phone companies, radio and TV broad-
casters, educational, community and
closed circuit TV; and long lines carrier
systems for both audio and video signals.

Silver Ball Seen In Ontario

At 10 a.m. on Monday, October 1, 1962, a silver ball-shaped object was spotted by various residents of Thistle ville, Ontario, Canada. It was still there at midnight and no explanation was forthcoming from responsible authorities although a diligent newspaper reporter at the London Free Press informed one inquiry that "it would probably go away after the observer had some sleep." During the evening, jet contrails in the vicinity of the object were seen by observers. The reporter for the Thamesville Herald concluded his rather humorous article: "So, after analyzing all the answers, we swear never to look at another object in the sky. Even if we see it. We'll ignore it." This seems to be good advice, inasmuch so few people take UFO seriously.
