DEAR SIR:

I AM WRITING TO YOU ON A SUBJECT
TO WHICH I KNOW YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR
WITH UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. SO I WOULD
LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION CONCERNING THIS
SUBJECT. LAST WEEK I VIEWED AN OBJECT
WHICH SEEMED TO BE TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED
IT CAME FROM THE NORTH WESTERN PART OF
THE SKY. AT THE TIME I SAW THIS OBJECT
THE VISIBILITY WAS PERFECT. THIS OBJECT
OR WHAT EVER IT WAS JUST SEEMED TO
COME OUT OF THE VASTNESS OF SPACE.

IT REMINDED ME VERY MUCH OF ROMAN
CANDLES IT WAS CIRCULAR IN SIZE AND ALSO
THERE WERE SPARKS COMING FROM IT AS IT
SPED THRU THE ATMOSPHERE. ALSO IT
LEFT A TRAIL OF SMOKE BEHIND IT THEN

Here is the text from the document:

Suddenly it just seemed to burn out. Do you think this was a helper or a UFO considering the way it acted? I would appreciate your opinion on this.

Thank you sincerely,
SHIRLEY-MASS

Dear 

This office has received a report of an unidentified flying object from Shirley, Massachusetts. The following is a suggested reply.

The object which you have described is similar to either a meteor or satellite decay. Several essential bits of information were omitted precluding a firm evaluation. The duration was omitted as well as the direction of travel. For the arc distance through which the object passed. Satellite decays are distinguishable from meteor observations by the direction of flight of the object and duration of the sighting.

A satellite observation from Massachusetts would hold an easterly component and the duration would be slightly longer that that associated with meteor observations.

The object which you have described is similar to either a meteor or satellite decay. Several essential bits of information were omitted as well as the evaluation. The duration was omitted through which the direction of travel for the arc distance distinguished the meteor passage. Satellite decays are distinguished from meteor observations by the direction of flight of the object and duration.

A satellite observation from Massachusetts would hold an essentially component and the duration would be slightly longer than that associated with meteor observations.
