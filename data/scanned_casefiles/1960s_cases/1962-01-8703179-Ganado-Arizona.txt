(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [redacted]

SIGNATURE: [redacted]
DATE: 12 March 1962

We (several of us) have seen this object quite a few times. I am a licensed pilot (ASEL-1460250) and am familiar by keen, anti-collision lights, etc. and feel this is not the case. Also, because of the stationary position, it is not an aircraft in my estimate. Sometime the object is a little north of east, sometimes a little farther to the south. (110-120°). My wife and I have seen it only once (maybe not the same one) in the day time driving into Gallup, New Mexico - this time a definite round shape was driving.

The presence of this object was not "suggested" to me when I saw it first I was alone and called it a witness.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Moved from A to B to C location

It seemed to disappear slowly fading from view and likely return while watching for (30 min)
