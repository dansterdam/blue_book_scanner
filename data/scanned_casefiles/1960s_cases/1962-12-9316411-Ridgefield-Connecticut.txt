Transcription of the text in the document:

December 14, 1962

U.S. Air Force Intelligence 
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen -

I would like to report a U.F.O. sighted on Tuesday, December 11 at 9:58 P.M. E.S.T. at , Ridgefield, Connecticut.

When I first saw the object it appeared like a huge star. It seemed to shine because the night was very dark - the moon barely visible - very low ceiling. Saturn was west of south.

The object appeared to sway gently - I called to my daughter to see the strange object in the sky. The star "had a deep blue-green light around it more intense near the center". It remained due East of us and was watched continuously for about 10 minutes. Then it just gradually disappeared. It moved very slowly and we could hear a low steady hum.

The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. 

The text reads:

"The shape of the U.F.O. when moving east was long and gone off very quickly. It was white.

I do not know how high this object was, but it seemed to be going quite fast. Speed was probably 700 m.p.h.

Truly yours,
[Redacted], Connecticut"
