Gentlemen:

I would like to report a U.F.O. sighted on Tuesday, December 4 at 9:30 P.M. E.S.T. at [redacted], Ridgefield, Connecticut.

When I first saw the object it appeared like a huge star. I thought at strange because the night was very dark - the moon hardly visible - nearly ceiling. Location was west by south west.

The object appeared to move very slowly - I called to my daughter & by the time she arrived on the balcony the "star" had moved about 100 feet to the North. So then more due East & we watched it until it went out of sight - about 2 minutes. It moved very slowly & we could hear a low steady hum.

Here is the text from the document:

The shape of this U.F.O. when moving East was long & gone off glow. Very white ghost like.

I do not know how high this object was, but it seemed to be quite low. Speed was probably 150 m.p.h.

Very truly yours,

Ridgefield, Connecticut
