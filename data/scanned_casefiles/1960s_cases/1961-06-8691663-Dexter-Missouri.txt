10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Star-like obj, bright reddish-orange at times and blue-white at others. Appeared slightly brighter than other stars, slightly larger than Venus. Without warning began to fade out like someone had turned out a light.

11. COMMENTS
12 moving obj. witnesses were symmetry 1/2 deg. in sky. Obj. became a haze layer, moving according to report. Other witnesses called out planets. A white luminous obj. Venus was in position reported. Venus, or any light source, viewed thru a haze layer will be an unusual appearance. Fact has odds of 1 viewed for over 2 hrs miles out s/c or on national. Any astronomical ball object observed in sky will appear to be moving. Disregarded. All appearances could very well be cloud. Is the conclusion that obj was probably Venus.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Note: Some words are partially illegible or obscured by black redaction marks]

[First paragraph is mostly illegible, with only fragments of words visible]

Dear [redacted]:

Your recent letter furnishing information on a UFO sighting is appreciated. In some cases, we may have more complete information.

I am forwarding a copy of the ATIC questionnaire with the request that you complete it as only this can provide almost the only source of information.

Dear Sirs:

This is a UFO sighting report. It took place on June 30, 1961 at Dexter, Missouri. All time checks in this report are approximate. Evidence available.

It was approximately 2:15 A.M. when we spotted the object. We were at Dexter on a farm. The sky was clear, the moon was full. We were out and so were a little later. We were out driving around when an object, slightly larger in size than a plane, was first noticed. As it first came to view, it was a blue-white object, slightly larger in size than a plane. At first it was moving slowly and was not paying attention to it. The next time I looked it was at about 200 feet at first. The next time I looked it was at about 100 feet. I cannot describe the exact shape of the object. No one was with me at the time. I was unobstructed view of the hill and was alone at the time. I was approximately 20 miles outside of town.

When we first noticed the object, it was low and to the northeast. If we circled it, it was slower and would move away. We could not determine the exact shape. It was and you had to watch closely to notice it.

I am a good observer and have seen many aircraft and reported to 2 bases. I am the chief mechanic who has worked on aircraft and reported to bases. I have worked on aircraft 15 years and remained one watch.

Sincerely to us, this is the first time we have seen such an object and could not identify it. We are curious to know what it was and would like to know if it was a clear or it was clean.


- page 11 -

I can partially read the text, but several sections are blacked out/redacted. Here's what I can discern:

[First paragraph is mostly illegible due to poor image quality]

[Middle paragraphs have some readable text, but many words are unclear]

"I changed position in this several times..."

[Bottom of the page has multiple black redaction marks covering text]

The document appears to be a typewritten report with significant portions intentionally obscured. The image quality is low, making complete OCR challenging.

- page 15 -

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by this match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
