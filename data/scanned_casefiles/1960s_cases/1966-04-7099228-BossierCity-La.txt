h. Remarks
This is a college student at La. Tech. at Ruston, La. He was home for the Easter week-end when some elderly neighbors sitting on their front porch called his attention to the strange light in the sky. He noted it visually, then went into his house and got his binoculars. He estimated the distance of the object to be approx. 3 miles away and stated that it was over Barksdale AFB or Shreveport City (a large shopping center just across the Red River Bridge from BARF). It appeared to be hovering, as though it was "taking pictures" then climbed at an extremely sharp rate (approx. a 60 degree angle) at the highest rate of speed the observer had ever seen. While trying to spot the object in the binoculars, he steadied the hood of an automobile and watched. The lights appeared to flash extremely bright, then fade to a dim light, but did not disappear. He followed the object with his glasses until it disappeared into the overcast.

INVESTIGATORS' REMARKS:
I drove to the area to see if I could see anything remotely resembling the object described. I did not, however, I could see the lights of Shreveport City reflecting in the sky and at this time there is a carnival operating at Shreveport City and there are many, many tall rides with bright and flashing lights. I feel quite strongly that what he saw was a light playing on the overcast. I appeared to flash and the reflective cloud edge was to the North. Last night I received a similar report of a red light from a portion of Shreveport south of the shopping center, but this report said the lights were to the North. Mr. Gaulden admittedly did not see the object but only the lights.
