UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING REPORT

On June 6, 1968, at approximately 11:15 p.m., Mr. J. Smith and Mrs. M. Johnson were driving south on Highway 61 near Davenport, Iowa, when they observed a bright light in the sky. 

The object appeared to be oval in shape and was emitting a bright glow. It hovered in the sky for several minutes before disappearing rapidly.

Mr. Smith and Mrs. Johnson stopped their vehicle and watched the object for approximately 5 minutes before it vanished from sight. They could not determine the size, altitude, or speed of the object due to the darkness and distance.

No other witnesses were reported, and no physical evidence was collected. This incident was investigated and documented as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects.

On June 6, 1968, at approximately 9:40 PM, several witnesses reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Davenport, Iowa. The object was described as a dark, elliptical shape that hovered in the air for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

According to the witness reports, the object was seen by multiple people in the area and was estimated to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. No sound was heard coming from the object, and it did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

The incident was reported to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program for investigating UFO sightings. An investigation was launched, and the case was documented in the Project Blue Book records.

The photograph included in the file appears to be a blurry image of the object as reported by the witnesses. However, the quality of the image makes it difficult to discern any clear details or features of the object.
