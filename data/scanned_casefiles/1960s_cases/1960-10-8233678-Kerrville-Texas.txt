4 November 1960

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your recent communications concerning the unidentified flying object sighted by you on 3 October 1960 near Kerrville, Texas.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Accordingly, we are thus far "investigating" each file only, since, as you know, the National Air Force investigation and forward the completed documents to the Aerospace Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis only.

From the little information given in your letter, it is believed the object viewed was probably a vector of the "fireball" class.

Sincerely,

Enclosure

Dear Sir;

Castle light of Ockers ninth was object was seen in no direction sky. It first appeared about forty degrees above the horizon and covered the distance of many degrees in few seconds from first observation at 9:05 P.M.

Upon sighting, I immediately compared the sighting of my chart to the object and found at the center of a half-circle at some length. I have no more to add, I did then, and so record herds.

My observation was about: a pitch green object, from west to west-southwest out of fuzzy-like shape angle. It appeared self-luminous, other than to be anything light. The object seemed to be a ball with an orb-like glow. I the star was visible near the object as the map recorded herds.

I place it on object from was the standard center bearing. I the moon was the opposite side of the building to the object's light and was watching television, only part of us saw the object. I but was not active north object of view and outside my I draw or near.

I sit in a place of the clock.
