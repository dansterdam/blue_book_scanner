The Commander, 745th ACW Squadron, Duncanville, Texas, was interviewed pertaining to subject sighting and stated that his unit had not had any reports of this sighting, nor had any radar interceptions been made during the date and time that the sighting of the unidentified flying object is alleged to have transpired. The Control Tower Operator, Love Field, Dallas, Texas, advised that on the evening of 16 May 1960, at approximately 2100 hours, an individual contacted him by telephone and related that he had observed an object "flying about" in the sky. He related that he immediately looked for such an object but could see nothing except the Eastern Star (a bright constellation which is visible in this area). The Control Tower Operator stated that he did not enter this incident on the control log because he could see nothing, nor did he obtain the name of the individual who reported sighting the object. [Redacted name] was questioned concerning this reporting and denied reporting the sighting to the Control Tower at Love Field.
