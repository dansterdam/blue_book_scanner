Dear Mr [redacted]

This will reply to your undated letter, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO Investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFOs in the Project Blue Book report we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

Dear Sirs:

Last Thursday, a friend and I experienced a frightening experience.
His name [redacted], South Zanesville, Ohio.
Sent him the same return letter you sent to me. We were camping out
in a tent about two hundred (200) feet from the nearest house. We were
sitting down outside the tent putting pieces of grass in-between our
thumbs and blowing on them to make a loud shrilling kind of noise. We
then at the next moment observed a very dim beam of light on the ground
a few feet in front of us. We thought it was [redacted] with a
flashlight shining it down near us, but then remembered that he had
the only flashlight of the family. We dove into the tent and grabbed out
our flashlights and went back outside and shone them up against some
trees wondering who hurled that beam in front of us. I then saw the same
thing, but, an a slim up in a tree (a dead tree with no leaves about 20
feet in the air). Then I shoved my flashlight on the tree and there was
nothing there. Steve saw the same when he was looking through a clearing
through a bunch of trees shining right in front of him not less than
15 feet in front of him. He shoved his flashlight on the path of the
mysterious beam only to experience the same thing - a red-eye, that
nothing was behind the light and beam was not even in sight for the rest
of the evening. We would like to know your opinion on what we saw.

Yours truly,
[signature redacted]
South Zanesville, Ohio

P.S. Please write and tell us what this was.
Thank You
