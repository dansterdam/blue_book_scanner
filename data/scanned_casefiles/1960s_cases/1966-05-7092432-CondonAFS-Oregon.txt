FROM: 636 Radar Sq (636GCR)
Condon AFS, Oregon 97623

6 July 1966

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 21 May 1966

TO: Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC) (TDEW/UPO)
Wright-Patterson AFS, Ohio 45433

1. Reference your letter, 7 June 66, subject same as above and attached FTD Form 164, the following information and explanation is submitted.

a. The objects sighted were bright white and red lights that appeared to be about ten (10) degrees above the normal horizon in a northerly direction from Condon AFS, Oregon. These lights appeared to go on and off at intervals of one to two minutes with no apparent movement when viewed through binoculars or the naked eye.

b. Since the lights persisted I drew a reference line on the window pane that I was looking through from inside my quarters to check for recurrence. During the next day I checked my reference line and found that the line coincided with the horizon formed by some distant mountains, approximately 100 miles away which are normally not visible. A check with the highway department revealed that a new road had recently been opened across the mountains. Subsequent viewings revealed the lights in the same location as the new road and the reference line on the window. Therefore I am reasonably certain that the lights were vehicle head and tail lights.

2. I regret the delay in answering your letter. This was due to my departing from Condon AFS on an extended leave shortly after the sighting.
