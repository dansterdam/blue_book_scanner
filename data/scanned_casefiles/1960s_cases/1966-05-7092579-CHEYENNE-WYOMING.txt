1. Reference AFR 200-2, as amended. The following described unidentified flying objects are reported as observed by two different groups at 2230 hours MST on 28 May 1966. Both groups observed from the same locality in the eastern part of Cheyenne, Wyoming.

2. Description of Object: Except for difference in size and direction, descriptions were the same. All sightings were from the ground without the aid of binoculars.

a. Two teenage boys were in the back yard observing the stars when object was observed and they called their father to verify the sighting. Object was found, about size of a dime held at arm's length, and was moving from southwest toward northeast. The outstanding characteristic was the alternately flashing blue to white light. There was no sound and after five minutes, object suddenly "blacked out" and was no longer visible. No estimate was given as to altitude.

b. The second observation was by two men, one a member of the Civil Air Patrol, was round, the size of a 25-cent piece held at arm's length, and moving rapidly in a southeasterly direction. The flashing blue to white light was very noticeable. There was no sound, nor were the observers able to determine altitude. After five minutes, object suddenly disappeared.

3. The weather was clear.

4. Weather balloons were released at 2300 hours MST by the local weather station.

5. Report was compiled by Major Elva D. Brown, Intelligence Officer, with over 19 years of military experience.
