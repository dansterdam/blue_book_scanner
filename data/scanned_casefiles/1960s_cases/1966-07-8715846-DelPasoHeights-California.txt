SUBJECT: UFO Report for 19 July 1966 (TDETR Ltr, 2 Aug 1966)

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. Mis                was contacted as suggested and could give no
additional information.

2. The preparing officer, Mr                made a check with Base
Operations and the Control Tower. They revealed no sightings or reports
of sightings from aircraft in the area on that particular day. He also
checked with the Base Weather Station and there was no weather phenomenon
in the area that could have lead to a mirage or reflection type sighting.

3. Conclusions by preparing officer:

a. Visual observation from the window revealed the morning star
(Jupiter) and another planet that appears near and to the lower left
were in the line of sight of                . Due to the time period and
length of sighting (3 to 4 hours), it is probable the observer was
watching the morning star and the associated planet.

b. No justification could be found to associate the humming sound
with the lights.
