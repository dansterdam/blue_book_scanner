COMMENTS: Reference the observers unidentified flying object observation of 20 Jul 63. Satellite records indicate that on 20 Jul 63 at approximately 10:57 pm, ECHO II should have been visible north of the observers position. The satellite traveled roughly due south and passed slightly east of the observers position. At about 11:06 pm it passed into the earth's shadow southwestward. The observers position and would not have been visible any longer.
ECHO II has a stellar magnitude of -1 and is such is brighter than almost all of the stars and most of the planets.

"INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE"

The handwritten text appears to be partially illegible, but I can make out some fragments:

"her and I observed was moving and
related to be self-conscious.

Bright stars - very bright, much brighter than
our star was visible time.

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 20 July 1968. Satellite records indicate that on 20 July 1968 at approximately 10:57 pm, ECHO II should have been visible northwest of your position. The satellite traveled roughly one south and passed slightly east of your position. At about 1106 pm it passed into the earth's shadow course. Your position and the time are no longer visible any longer. ECHO II has a stellar magnitude of -1 and is such that a brighter than normal star of the star mass most of the planets.

Dear[REDACTED]

This will reply to your recent letter in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO Investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

Dear Sir:

The report on a UFO which you will read following this paragraph has been sent to you a little late. "Reason why it is being sent to you a little late is as follows:" I had originally sent this report to Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, and received an answer three weeks later. They had sent the address of "Project Blue Book" and said that investigation of unusual aerial phenomena has been the responsibility of the United States Air Force and to direct my inquires to you.

An exact report on the UFO which my father and myself observed is contained in the following part of this letter.

The night of the Twentieth of July at approximately 11:00 my father and myself had just returned from picking up my sister from a baby sitting job. I had gotten out of our car and walked to the front of the house to look at the stars when I noticed an unusually bright object among the stars (as it seemed). As I observed this stubby cylindrical shaped object I called my father and asked him if it was just an illusion or was this object really moving, he answered and said that it was moving and without any apparent sound.

This object was or as it appeared to be at a fantastic altitude and moving at an amazing rate of speed with a very faint tail and an appearance in brightness and size six times that of any star I could see. After watching the UFO for about


- page 6 -

ten min. or so it disappeared as if it were never there

The reason why I am sending you this letter with the approximate course of the UFO is to find out if there is any satellite, asteroid, or comet passing over the Earth in a course that would cover New England.

The object which we observed could not of been a meteor entering the atmosphere for it did not decline in altitude or speed but did stay in a fixed orbit and did not break up or die out slowly but blanked out with no traces in a clear space with no obstruction to our vision. This night was suppose to be the clearest night July. This report which you have just read is true it is not fake.

My age is fourteen, I attend Cathedral High School, Sprfld. Mass. and I am about to enter into tenth grade.

Sincerely Yours:

P.S. This report is non-fiction and not science-fiction.

    The closest object I tried to align of
    a liner at the sky & can think of was
    the edge of water.

    I saw a cylinder like some what slight move
    look a bit like a wing of water at top
