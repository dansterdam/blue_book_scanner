[Handwritten text]
On this evening a group of people were gathered at a farm house, near Springfield, Massachusetts, when suddenly a bright luminous object was seen in the sky. It seemed to be hovering and moving erratically for some time. It would speed up suddenly, then slow down and hover, repeating this pattern of behavior. The object appeared to be oval or disk-shaped and was emitting a bright pulsating light. Several of the witnesses observed the object through binoculars and felt that it was definitely not an aircraft or any other known object. After a period of about 30 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and shot straight up, disappearing from view very rapidly.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Observation  

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 20 July 1968 at approximately 10:37 pm, EDST. It should have been visible north of your position and would have appeared to be stationary for a brief period, then disappear rapidly in a southerly direction. The earth's hazey southeast of your position may have indicated its presence, and would not have seen visible by localized observatories. 

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

SAP-OTCO/Mass #70926/AUG 29. 1968

Dear ...:

This is in reply to your report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on August 29, 1968.

We appreciate your submitting this report. However, if your sighting was of an object in the sky and not an actual landing or close encounter with a craft, we will not be able to investigate it further and make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFOs in the technical information we can provide.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base or United States Coast Guard station, so that they can make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF Branch
Chief, Civil Division

Dear Sir,
The report on a UFO which you will read following this paragraph has been sent to you a little late. Because why it is being sent to you a little late is as follows: I had originally sent this report to Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, and received an answer that this week later. They had sent the address of "Project Blue Book" and said that investigation of unusual aerial phenomena has been the responsibility of the United States Air Force and to direct my inquiries to you.
An exact report on the UFO which my father and myself observed is contained in the following part of this letter.
The night of the Twentieth of July at approximately 11:00 PM, my father and myself had just stepped outside of our car when I noticed an unusually bright object in the stars (as it seemed). As I observed this stubby cylindrical-shaped object I called my father and asked him if it was just an illusion or was this object really moving. He answered and said that it was moving and without any apparent sound.
This object was of an apparent to be of a fantastic altitude and moving at an amazing rate of speed with a very small tail and an appearance in brightness and also six times that of any star I could see. After watching the UFO for about ten minutes, it disappeared.

The top diagram appears to be a radar or direction-finding sketch with various directional indicators labeled.

The two lower diagrams depict a person standing in a landscape, presumably representing an approximate movement or perspective.

Transcribing the text in the image:
