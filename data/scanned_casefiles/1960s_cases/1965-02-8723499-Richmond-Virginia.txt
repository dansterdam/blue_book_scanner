At 1040, 4 Feb 65, Mr. Vincent Hansen, Boulder, Colorado called regarding a balloon observation over Virginia. 
Yesterday he had indicated that their balloon had gone down over Arkansas. There is a 99% chance that the balloon observed here was the one and the same. The balloon was launched from Ray Experiment, At 1100 EST on 2 Feb 65, the package cut free from the balloon and descended parachute fashion to 14,000 feet until sunset at which time it descended the Allegiant Coast about two or four hours after launch. Winds at 10,000 feet were from west to east at 60 knots.
