At 1040, 4 Feb 65, Mr Vincent Boulder, Colorado called regarding balloon observation over Virginia.

Yesterday he had indicated that their balloon had gone down over Arkansas, this was in error. There is a 95% chance that the balloon observed belonged to them. The 6 million cubic foot balloon was launched from Page, Arizona on 1 Feb 65, 2300 MST floated to 180,000 feet. It was carrying a Cosmic Ray Experiment. At 1100 EST on 2 Feb 65 the package cut free from the balloon and landed by parachute three miles South of Lightsville, Arkansas.

The balloon normally shatters or bursts after this. They believe it descended to 105,000 feet until sunset at which time it descended in the Atlantic ocean about two or four hours after sunset. Winds at 140,000 were 270° at 129 knots. This is only data available on wind.
