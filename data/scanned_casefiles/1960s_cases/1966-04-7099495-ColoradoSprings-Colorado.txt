Four objects seen by one observer 7 by the other. Objects appeared for 5-10 seconds separately. Observed above the horizon and appeared to go down into the ground. Their shape was round, and they were gold or yellow in color.

Ft Carson had seven artillery batteries firing 10-15 miles south of the city until 0700. Artillery Flares were used. Flares are generally yellow and star shaped. Parachute descent would allow flare to be in line of sight, on burn out, appear to be fading away, and descending.

Twelve to fifteen objects were observed all moving in a large circle. As a group the objects trajectory was clinging and rising. The color of the objects was clover and their size was about like a marble.
The sun is low in the west and setting. The objects were probably the result of reflected sunlight off the bodies of birds
