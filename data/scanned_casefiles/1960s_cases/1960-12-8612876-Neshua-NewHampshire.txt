time!

Dear Sirs-

I first saw a flying
saucer, first time in
my life with my own eyes.

I've read of it in
news papers, seen pictures
of it in Movie News.
But nothing like this one.

It was flying over the
ice pond here on Pine St.
near my house.

Here is the text from the document:

-9-

Must be a detachable
and portable, can be
handle on moments
not like and Communicates
From Beach to Beach-
It has the sound of
a smooth running
fishing putter Boat-

The sound drove me
to take a look on the
ice pond, the sun, shining
bright beamed on that
water and the light
flashed me in the eye
that's how I spotted it

For twelve minutes then
went high above the clouds

that saucer is
shaped like a
double space cover,
grey glassy metal.

Handwritten & by
Item no. 9

By the Way, its your meant
in the State of New England
The Altitude is so low, that
Enemy planes ate Could
fly down and still never
see you tell!! The sky or trying
low and Pings able smoke screen.

For instance the difference
at the North West passage
like Montana, the
altitude there is so high
the Northern lights clothe
anything with life lights.

the Flying saucer
I've seen to-day was
no playtoy from any
body's back yard.
I'm sure -

well, I thought I'd
let you know
Sincerely,

On December 27, 1960 a ball of blue fire fell out over sky and exploded in orange flash over Grady Court in East Boston. It made a roar, created a blast of fire, making a whistling sound and alarming residents in the area. It was confirmed by firemen and policemen.
