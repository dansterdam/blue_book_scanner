Sgt. Marcel, at very low altitude it was about
the size of medium plane, appeared silver with
flashing red light on bottom and several red
lights on top. First seen in NE, moved to SW
and made a 180° turn to the NNE where it disappeared, made the turn at very low altitude,
seemed to suddenly vanish. Seen for 5-6 min.

11. COMMENTS
Object was seen over a fairly highly populated area for a period of 5-6 min. It was size of a medium plane at a very low altitude, according to witness. There is no information in the report to indicate that this is closer than an a/c. Speed and flashing indicate along with the maneuvers indicate this conclusion.
