stretch across a field in back of their house, until it
disappeared from view. "Mrs. " was so shaken
she could not get to sleep," he said. "We talked about it until
4:30 A.M."

Mrs. called the Naval Air Station around 8:30 A.M.
and someone there took her name and telephone number saying they
would call her later, but no call came. Both Mr. and Mrs.
cautiously asked their neighbors if they had heard a
sound during the night. The three neighbors they asked all had
heard a loud sound but did not get out of bed to look as they
had dismissed it as a low-flying jet.

At first the were reluctant to tell anyone what
they had seen. Later, after the Patriot Ledger, a local Quincy
newspaper, published a photo taken by one of its
reporters of a UFO in the skies that same night (July 25th)
along with reports of visual sightings of a UFO, - the Gilberti's
told their story to the Patriot Ledger (See photostat of news-
clipping attached to data sheet).

The said they had no idea what the object could
have been but were certain it was not an airplane or a helicopter.
Both families (The and the ) were sincere
and my brother and I were convinced that they had seen and/or
heard what they had described - an Unidentified Flying Object.

26 June 1963
South Weymouth, Mass

On June 20, Mr. and Mrs. Enrico Gilbert of East Weymouth spotted a UFO at 1 a.m. Next morning they reported the sighting to the Naval Air Station at South Weymouth and Mrs. Gilbert said the authority who took the report "didn't seem too surprised." The description of the sighting: Both Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert described the craft as "very large, bigger than a truck, with brilliant orange light on its bottom and a white light of equal intensity on its top." They said the object flew "with a deafening roar" about 100 feet over the ground, apparently following the path of some high tension wires near the Gilbert home. Its shape, Gilberti said, was best described by using the traditional "flying saucers" concept, or more exactly, two saucers inverted toward each other. Around its middle, he said, was a protruding lip.

The two lights were shaped like a Turk's fez hat, or a cone with the top cut off, he said. It flew smoothly, very low, almost right above the treetops, Gilberti said. The roar was deafening. "Up to now we've always thought of those people who believe in flying saucers as nuts," his wife added. "But now I believe it, and I both saw it and it was some sort of machine, not a balloon or some other explanation."

Mr.
Attleboro, Massachusetts

Dear

Thank you for your letter of July 17. I was very glad to get the clipping. I heard about this UFO but had not seen a copy of it until your letter arrived.

There are many different ways in which this UFO could have come about. First of all, remember that the man did not see anything in the sky. He was just taking pictures of the stars and the trails show clearly. It is very easy to get a film light strike. First of all this can happen in the developer. There may be some fault in the developer which can produce this sort of defect. The person might have had a shutter that stuck and momentarily at least as he warped his camera around happened to point it toward a fairly bright light. The shutter might not stick again. I know of several UFOs that are due to this effect. Also in loading or unloading the camera he might have inadvertently exposed the film. It would be interesting to know whether this was either the first or the last film on the reel. Sometimes a mirror mechanical abrasion can cause development of the image. We are not sure whether the man who took the picture did the development or not. There have been many similar unexpected images on photographic films that have been reported as UFOs, some very similar to this. He says that he took precautions as that on a somewhat headlight would not shine into the lens. But I would like to know whether he used a flashlight or not. Sometimes the light from a flashlight, even if not directly shining in the lens, will white in indirectly reflected perhaps from a wrinkled or a ring. The fact that some one of the UFO "study groups" confirmed that this was a true UFO does not impress me. Nor does the attempt that this group "works closely with the Air Force," which is manifestly inaccurate and probably untrue. The rectangular motions are of no significance either. The only reported angular movements that I know of are those on radar, not on visual sources. Nor would I completely rule the "playful child" argument about the focus does not convince because secondary reflections could have occurred that would have produced this sort of an effect. I would like to see an enlargement or copy (in color) of the original. I should also like to ask the photographer whether his camera automatically shifts the frame or not. I am trying to eliminate the possibility of an accidental double exposure.

He states that "what it photographed was definitely in the sky." He further states that he kept the camera in constant view. But he also said that he had not seen the object. I maintain that there is no proof that it was definitely in the sky or that it was something that had moved into camera view, hovered in at least seven spots, made whatever, then left the camera's view.

"I admit it is very difficult

Dr. Hawkins listed three rea-
sons why the lights in the night
sky would obscure some of the
star trails. None of the reasons
were very satisfactory as a light

obscured, and it is very unlikely
that the low form of flying saucer

I definitely discount the statement of Putnam concerning the report of the two West Quincy girls. There have been far too many "confirmations" of this sort. Does he not at least produce a pre-dated paper reporting this citing by the West Quincy girls?

Sorry to be such a skeptic. I don't know whether any group is checking up on the picture. They would not normally be doing so unless he actually sent up the pictures. They would normally be writing to Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Field, Dayton Ohio. I hope that my reply has at least communicated some of my scientific observations in the interpretation. I am quite sure that the person who made the observation is honest and reliable. But if he is an expert photographer, he should know that what I have said about possible defects is true. I am, therefore, sending him a copy of my letter.

Incidentally, you may be interested to know that my new book, "The World of Flying Saucers," published by Doubleday, written jointly by myself and Mrs. Lyle Boyd, will be on the bookstands in just a few days. I deal with photographic saucers there, in one of the chapters.

Thanking you for your interest, I am

News Photog Snaps UFO

APRO HAS in its possession a colored slide of an object photographed on time exposure by a professional photographer, Mr. Pothier of Wollaston, Mass. In a by-lined story in the Quincy Patriot-Ledger, Mr. Pothier described his experience which took place on either the 25th or 26th of June 1963.

Pothier was taking time photos of stars in order to record the tracks of same, from his back yard at Wollaston, Mass. His equipment consisted of a Japanese 3½ mm camera on a tripod. He was using Kodachrome X film. Other than checking the distance he did not touch the equipment until 30 minutes after he opened the shutter, when he returned to close it.

Two weeks later Pothier had the film developed. On the slide he immediately spotted something which wouldn't have been there—a clear pattern of lights which moved into the camera's view, hovered in at least 10 spots, maneuvered, then left the camera's view again.

In Pothier's own words: "The time exposure was able to capture all this, and the intensity of the lights on the color slide clearly show just where the lights stopped and moved, leaving either an image of the lights or a colored track. In back of the orange, white and silver lights were the star trails which was originally the purpose of the photo."

Pothier eventually showed the photo to Stephen Putnam, a mechanical engineer, APRO member and President of the Two-State UFO Group, of Egypt, Mass. Putnam, in a statement to the Patriot-Ledger said after a three-hour study of the slide, that the lights never changed its attitude relative to the ground, and appeared to make 90 degree turns without turning itself."

(Continued from Page 1)

"Except for a brilliant orange nucleus, which remained in a central position, no matter what way the object moved, the lights turned or curved, the lights defy known explanation," Putnam said.

Putnam pointed out that the structure of the object would be invisible on the slide, as it was, just as a night picture of a car would show only headlights.

Obviously the lights were not caused by a balloon or airplane and the color of the lights precludes the helicopter explanation. The focus of the camera was set at infinity, thus ruling out close-in objects such as fireflies, etc.

For camera enthusiasts, Pothier elaborates the details about his 1½ was a Heiland Pentax 35 mm. with an F1.45 lens. The film was Kodachrome X, ASA 25, lens wide open and set for infinity.

Exit and entrance trails of the object which made the image are very dim indicating that whatever it was is now either accelerating rapidly or descending into camera range during its exit and entrance upon the scene. In a letter dated August 8, John T. Hopf, APRO photo analyst, had this to say: "There is no question but that this is a real image of some light source, we have positively ruled out processing or film defects. I know from my experience as an astronomer who said that if there was a solid body behind the light it would obscure the star trails. I know from my own experience that an object passing in front of the stars for a short time will not show an effect on the trails in an exposure as long as 20 minutes as this one was. I think this photo is worth running in the Bulletin although we will probably never know just what caused it."

After Pothier's story the Patriot-Ledger carried an account in its July 30 edition which was headlined: "UFO Photo Reveals Astronomer at B.U. and Quincy Sees Unusual Lights" of the Boston University Observatory: "I would hesitate to say the photograph does show a flying saucer although I admit it is very difficult to explain the photograph." He also said: "If there were a solid object in the sky it would obscure some of the star trails. None of the trails in the picture were obscured. There were several areas on the film where no light has fallen. This is probably obscuration of some sort and it is very unlikely that the glow from a flying saucer would be shining through some sort of grid. And, the complicated pattern, similar to those found in multiple light regions, does not agree at all with the known descriptions of flying saucers."

It is obvious from Dr. Hawking's comments that he has had little experience with the study of flying saucers. Mr. Hopf has deftly and correctly disposed. Hawking's theory about the obscuration of star trails, and most UFO experts, upon seeing the slide, remark about the similarity between the color and apparent placement of lights and the many sightings which describe almost those exact characteristics.

It would seem the UFO suddenly attained some sort of legitimacy after being published in the Patriot-Ledger. Shortly, Pothier and others received accounts of various UFO sightings in the area.

On the evening of July 28, 1963 my brother and I interviewed two families on Commercial Street, East Weymouth, Massachusetts in regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object which was seen, heard, and photographed in the Southshore area during the night of June 25th and the early morning hours of June 26, 1963.

Attached is a photostat of a completed UFO Data Sheet which is based upon a USAF Technical Information Sheet. The drawings of the UFO were done by Mr. [Redacted]. We went through the form together objectively filling in the information. Both Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted] signed the completed form. The following is a brief account of our interview with them and a family who live next door.

THE [REDACTED] INTERVIEW - [REDACTED]

Upon arriving in the [REDACTED] neighborhood, we first interviewed Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] who live next door to the [REDACTED]. Mr. [REDACTED] works an evening shift and had just gotten into bed shortly before he and his wife heard a very loud "humming vibrating sound" AT ABOUT 1:00 A.M. JUNE 26. He said the sound was not that of an airplane. He is familiar with the sound of airplanes as he had flown in B-17's during World War II and later served during the Korean War. His wife, because the sound was so peculiar, asked him to get out of bed to see what it could be. However, he felt too tired to get out of bed.

THE [REDACTED] INTERVIEW - [REDACTED] Street

Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] were awakened about 1:00 A.M. on June 26, 1963 by an "un-godly sound" - like a slow moving jet" - is the best they could describe it. Their bed was pulled up to the back window so as to keep cool. Their heads were near the window and they both looked out. Mrs. [REDACTED] saw the UFO and was terrified, jumping under the covers. Mr. [REDACTED] observed the object for approximately one minute. "It", he said, was like "two hamburger buns one on top of another with a sandwiched piece of meat protruding around". Its outline was seen because of two lights on the object, one on the top and one on the bottom which were shaped like "Turkish Fez hats". It hovered momentarily, slowly moved at a height of about 100 feet over trees about 300 feet away, crossed power lines
