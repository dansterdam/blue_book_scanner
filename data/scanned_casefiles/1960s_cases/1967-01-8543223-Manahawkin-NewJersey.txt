34. Date you completed this questionnaire: [Blank fields for Day, Month, Year]

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

as I stated before we are certain the object was not an aircraft (plane). We see many planes at night as we are barely between HAFB, Pomona and Mcguire. We doubt that it could have been anything from those at Bailey's Island. We are just as interested as you, perhaps more so.

Since we saw the object, in knowing what it was, we have not seen another UFO since then.

If you may be interested in knowing that a U.S.O. was over Palmyra, N.J. the night of January 19th, a friend of ours spoke of it. Then we mentioned our experience. He suggests 10 other people saw the UFO in Palmyra and we understand that there was mention of it in their local paper.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   8     May     1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

It thought it was what might be a super event after the object had disappeared into the cloud bank in the S.S.E. horizon. However, we are not certain of this. The object, when we first saw it, hung in the sky like an extremely bright star, but bigger and brighter than any thing we had ever seen before. Suddenly, the object moved in a straight line, parallel to the earth, across the sky at an incredible speed and disappeared into the cloud bank in the S.S.E. horizon (over the ocean).

We know the object was not a plane, we see many planes at night some are located fairly near McGuire Air Force Base, Pomona Field and N.A.F.E.C.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or meteorite, of which we have seen quite a few.

As I have said before, we are very interested in learning more about the object we saw. The sudden movement and speed of the object were fantastic.

Dear Sir:

On January 26th, between 10:15 and 10:30 P.M., as we were driving north on Route 9 toward Manahawkin, we saw a very strange sight in the sky north and slightly to the west of us.

When we first noticed the object, which looked to be a brilliant white and not quite round, we thought it was a star but we had never noticed any quite so large now brilliant in that part of the sky before. The object moved from the northwest toward the east by southeast in a straight line and at a rate of speed which was fantastic. As we watched, the object disappeared into a cloud bank and simply vanished.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or meteorite, of which we have seen a few over the years, and the object did not move or fall toward the earth. It was moving parallel to the earth and, as I said before, traveled straight as a die from the northwest to the east by southeast at an incredible speed.

I called the Coast Guard but they knew of no special Coast Guard nor Navy air activity in this area. I also wrote to W.A.F.B. in Atlantic City and will they reported to me that they had no aircraft in this area on that night and also, none of their aircraft operates above the speed of regular airliners.

Please advise me if inquire had anything in the air the night of January 26th in the locality mentioned and traveling in the direction specified.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your reply.

Yours truly,

Dear Sir:

Last evening, between 10:15 and 10:20 P.M., as we were driving north on Route 9 toward Manahawkin, we saw a very strange sight in the sky about of us.

At the time we (my husband and I) sighted this brilliant object, which looked to be not quite round, we were about one mile south of the Manahawkin intersection, i.e., routes 9 and 72. When we spotted the object it was considerably north of us and slightly west and was moving. We were amazed at the rigidity of the flight of this object across the sky - in a straight line - headed in a southeasterly by easterly direction. As we watched it disappeared into a cloud bank in the east. The object simply vanished.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or meteorite, of which we have seen a few over the years. The object was moving parallel to the earth and traveled straight as a die from the northwest to the southeast by east. And, as I said before, the speed was fantastic.

This morning I called the Coast Guard but they knew of no special Coast Guard nor Navy activity in this area. I have also written to the N.A.S.B.C. in Atlantic City to ascertain what they may know.

Please advise me if the Air Force or N.A.S.A. had anything in this locality at the time I mentioned and traveling in the N.J.S. direction.

Also, please inform me of the name and address of the special Bureau which has been set up to study U.F.O.

Thank you for your attention to my requests and for your reply as soon as possible.

Yours truly,
