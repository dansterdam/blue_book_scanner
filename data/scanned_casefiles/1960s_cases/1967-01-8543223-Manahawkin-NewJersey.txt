14. Date you completed this questionnaire:
Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

We have been trying to recall as mush detail of the object as we could. We suspect it was and I'll call it circular as best we could determine form the distance it appeared, however it was too far away to be sure that it was circular. The shape was not clear nor did we see any windows or openings. The color was not bright but rather a dull grayish-white. It was moving at a moderate speed, not extremely fast. It seemed to float through the air, as if it were not propelled as we know planes to be. We did not notice any exhaust or sound from it. So our impressions are that it was an object that we had never seen before and which did not resemble any conventional aircraft. We have not seen another H.F.O. since then.

You may be interested in knowing that a U.F.O. was reported in the night of January 17, '68 by several officers of our local police department. Also our neighbor, whose house is across the street, reported seeing the same object at the same time as we did, though apparently from a slightly different angle. We recall that something appeared to be moving in the sky, at first very slowly and then at a faster pace. We watched it for perhaps a minute before it disappeared from our view over the trees. I would be glad to cooperate further if you have any other questions.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: May 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

After it had disappeared for quite a while, the object finally reappeared. The EST Harrison Ranger, he claims, were watching certain of the object when we first saw it hanging in the sky. The object was extremely bright, brighter than any normal star, but bigger and brighter than any plane. It made no noise and disappeared into the clouds across the sky at an incredible speed and disappeared into the dark bank in the E.S.E. horizon over the ocean.

We knew the object was not a plane, we see many planes at night since we are located near Maguire Air Force Base, Pomona Field, and I.A.F.B.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or meteorite, of which we have seen quite a few.

As I have said before, we are convinced in learning more about the object we saw. The sudden movement and speed of the object were fantastic.

Here is the text from the document:

February 21, 1969

Commandant
Manahawkin Air Force Base
Port Dix, N.J.

Dear Sir:

On January 26th, between 7:15 and 10:30 P.M., as we were driving north on Route 9 toward Tuckerton, we saw a very strange sight in the sky north and slightly to the west of us. 

A brilliant white and blue object which looked to be at least a half mile across the sky suddenly appeared and hovered in a straight line and at a constant level about 1/4 of the sky before. The object moved from the northwest toward the east by southeast in a straight line and at a rate of speed which was fantastic. As it traveled, the object disappeared into a cloud.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or satellite. We have seen many such before, and the object did not move or fall toward the earth. It was moving parallel to the horizon and at an incredible speed from the northwest to the east by southeast.

We would appreciate your investigation of this matter. The Coast Guard nor Navy air activity in this area, and they reported to us that they had no aircraft in this area at that time or night and also, none of their known operations above the speed or regular air traffic.

Please advise us if you require any further information regarding the sighting and direction specified.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your reply.

Yours truly,

The text in the document is as follows:

"January 26, 1957

Air Force Chief of Staff
United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last evening, between 10:15 and 10:20 P.M., as we were driving north on Route 9 toward Manahawkin, we saw a very strange sight in the sky about 20 miles south of us.

At the time we (my husband and I) sighted the brilliant object, which looked to be quite around, we were a short distance south of the Manahawkin intersection, i.e. Routes 9 and 72. When we stopped the car and got out, the object was confirmed to be quite large and was moving. We were amazed at the brilliancy of the light which appeared to be emanating from its southern or southeasterly by easterly direction. As we watched it disappeared in a downward motion simply vanishing.

We are certain the object was not a plane or meteorite. The object was moving parallel to the earth and traveled straight as a die from the northwest to the southeast. And as I said before, the speed was fantastic.

This morning I called the Coast Guard, but they knew of no special Coast Guard nor Navy activity in this area. I have also written to the U.S.O.O. in Atlantic City to ascertain what they may know.

Please advise me if the Air Force or U.S.O.O. and anything further in this location. Also, please inform me of the name and address of the special Bureau which has been set up to study U.F.O.

Thank you for your attention to my requests and for your reply as soon as possible.

Yours truly,
