Insufficient data off valuation

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] 21 September 1966

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your letter of 21 September 1966 regarding your unusual observation on the night of 19 September 1966. Without additional information a comprehensive study is not possible.

From the submitted information it does appear that the moon could have been responsible for the observation. This would depend on whether you observed this object at 9:30 P. M. CST or CDT.

Since the moon would have been setting at approximately 2100 CST on a azimuth of 250 degrees, the one hour would have made a lot of difference. On the 19th, the moon would have been approaching the first quarter which occurred on 21 September 1966.

If you would complete the enclosed Air Force form 164, a more scientific investigation will be possible.

Dear Sir:

On Monday, September 19, 1966 at approximately 9:30 p.m. shadow teacher-A. D. Williams, a student and I were returning from driving the football players home after practice. On our way back we saw an object through and above the trees which appeared to be the moon, but on approaching closer, the object disappeared behind or in the trees.

There was no moon reflection, but it had a reddish orange glow and was shaped in the form of a quarter moon. It appeared to be about 10 feet in width and approximately 50 to 75 feet in length.

The object appeared approximately 5 miles South of Haynesville, Louisiana, East off Highway 79.

We think this is worthy of investigation.

Merely yours,
[Signature is obscured]
