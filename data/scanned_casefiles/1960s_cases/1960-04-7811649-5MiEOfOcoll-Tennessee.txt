The object was moving from approximately North to approximately South at a pretty fair rate of speed. [Redacted] remarked that it was [redacted] mighty slow, which would be the impression at the height it must have been traveling. The object did not seem to be falling, but was moving away from us at an angle that caused it to become smaller by slow degrees.

I stepped the car on the pavement to watch the show for a minute or two, realized that this was really something- [redacted] had said immediately that it must be the Sputnik we'd been reading about that was going to strike the atmosphere and burn itself out. But she remembered that this was to have been early that morning and the first moment we saw this one, she looked at her watch and it showed 7:10 p.m. (Actual time was 7:30)

After a moment on the pavement with cars and trucks whizzing by in the other direction I pulled off the pavement, cut the motor and watched out the window where I had a fine view of this lit-up baby. I still think we watched it for 15 minutes, but says not that long. Finally the object resolved the elongated stretch of black cloud and disappeared behind it, somewhere the long way, and I restarted the motor and we headed for the Lewis lodge, several miles down the road.

As we turned into the parking area there the object reappeared beyond the cloud which had by then changed shape somewhat and thinned out. The object now was much farther away, getting smaller, and was turning a dark red instead of the almost white color it had been before, the change possibly caused by the atmosphere's in the vicinity of the cloud.

We stepped out of the car and watched it again for a minute before I went in the Inn and told my pt we were watching, thinking it to be the said Sputnik. I thought he was being kidded and was a bit reluctant about coming out to look at it, but was finally persuaded to do so. We watched it together for several minutes before the object, getting smaller and redder as it moved away toward the south, again moved in behind a large cloud and we gave up on it, figuring that by the time it could emerge on the other side it would be so far away and dim through the sky mist that we'd be unable to see it any more.

I phoned my paper about it to the my editor.

from Halley's right on down. They had curved tails, mostly, that brooded as they left the comet head and appeared wide and thin at the end. The tail on this object of ours was the same all the way back until it suddenly rounded off at the end. The said several times later that the tail must have been a mile long, judging from the distance the object must have been from us in the sky. This I don't know. For I've still no idea how high, or how far away the thing was.

I know this--it was much brighter --from head to tail-- than my moon either of us has ever seen on the brightest night; it traveled much faster, apparently, than the fastest jet plane high in the sky--and we see plenty of them in the Chattanooga area, since they seem to use the TVA lakes as their turning points on training trips--and this baby was so apparently burning itself

out in the atmosphere that there could b little about it.
Nor about its size, its height, its apparently level flight, or
its effort to gt wherever it was going in a
gosh-awful hurry.
To all of which, a very serious minded gentleman indeed,
agreed completely. "If you like I'll sign affidavits to all of
it," he said.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: 5 Miles E. of Cecil, Tennessee

Date: 8 April 1960       Hour (Z): 0010Z

WX: 12,000' scattered, vis 30 pl miles

Description: Round w/tail, size of basketball at arm's length, reddish-white, much brighter than any moon ever seen, while watching it the first time it moved behind a cloud. Several minutes it reappeared from behind the cloud. It began to turn dark red, finely large to the south behind a cloud. Seen for about 15 minutes (?)

Direction of Motion: SE to NW ( N to S )

Satellites: (AFOIN-4F3, Phone 69219)  Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.)  Ruled out

Radar Analysis (AFOIN-481)        None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)  Ruled out

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.  Ruled out

Other:  Soft control

Evaluation of Source Reliability:  Unreliable

Analysis and Conclusions: It is highly probable that these witnesses observed the vapor trail of a high flying aircraft, illuminated by sunlight. The reason the object was still in sunlit ( after official sunset for the latitude and altitude ) was due to its altitude. An area PT at 30,000 would have approximately 15 minutes more sunlight than a point on the ground corresponding to its position. The phenomenon of the object, just before it disappeared, is probably due to sunset at the aircraft altitude and the associated reddening of the sun in the increased scattering of the atmosphere. This is an increased effect of sunset and sunrise due to the longer path through the atmosphere.

DAILY AND SUNDAY

Sunday p.m. April 10, 1960

Lt. Thos. L. Bates,
Operations Officer,
Blountstone Air Force Station,
Lookout Mountain, Tenn.

Dear Sir:

Attached are my thoughts on the burning object seen in the sky April 9, at :10 p.m. I knocked this off about two hours after seeing the object while the whole thing still was fresh in my mind.

Mrs. [redacted] of [redacted], Tenn. who owns and operates [redacted] doesn't believe we watched it as long as I thought we did.

Anyway, from my wife's after sundown until almost dark, the object was in view from Lake Ocoee, before it disappeared a second time behind a distant cloud.

The object was so large, so bright and so almost in our laps that we didn't believe about the whole thing. Very much, figuring that any number of others must have seen it also. But 7:10 p.m. is more and more clearly in my mind, and most folks must have been in their houses.

If you should have any confirmation of the whole thing, I'd appreciate it as you'd have no reason to let me know. Thanks for the patience of you and your men in listening to me tell it.

Kindest regards,

[signature redacted]
Chattanooga Times

From Tellico Plains we cut back through the foothills on Highway 30 to Lake Ocoee to spend the night with the [redacted] at [redacted] Cross Inn, etc. there was work to be done the next morning early in the Ocoee Wildlife Management Area (turkey Season opened there Thursday).

As we came out of Highway 30 onto the lakeside highway from Ducktown [redacted] discovered what we both thought to be one of the Sputniks doing an a burn in the atmosphere somewhere between Ocoee Inn and Cleveland. Thruway was just a moment or so after sunset, the sky in that immediate area clear, and it was evident that whatever the object was it was burning itself out in the atmosphere. The height could not be judged, but later--possibly 15 minutes or so, although [redacted] thinks less--it disappeared behind a long thin and black cloud formation, so it had to be higher than the clouds. It could have been 30 or 40 or 50 miles up. I'm no judge of such things, any more than you can look at the moon and say how high it is.

The object was brilliant against the evening sky, possibly the size of the moon at its lowest, but much brighter than you have ever seen. Strung out behind it was a fiery tail the width of the diameter of the object. The tail held this width for its entire length--about 10 times the diameter of the object itself--then spread out in a curved finish at the end. [additional text partially cut off]
