Dear Mr.

Mrs. reported to the United States Air Force the fact that you sighted an unidentified flying object on Thursday night 21 July 1960 at 9:30 p.m. near Hyattsville, Maryland.

Your report contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, request you complete the attached Air Force Questionnaire in regard to the sighting and forward the completed paper to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for analysis and/or evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
