Observers have noted various objects in the skies for several nights. All objects have appeared as lights with various colors, being observed. "The objects were all moving slowly, but not as fast as stars or planes." Some objects were still while others went both up and down and sideways. Colors changed more than flashed when viewed through telescope. Red, green, and white flashing lights were observed.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground Visual

7. COURSE
Varied

Due to the various descriptions and the time of observance of the alleged UFOs, it is probable that the witnesses were watching various stars that were visible.

get the telescope focused on them. Clearly
but could see red + green flashed thru it.

These were all moving slowly, but not out for

Here is the text from the document:

The first one we saw came in like a plane & stopped & started flashing.

They didn't move on past us plane. The constellation would move as time passed, but these stayed in the same area of sky, but were moving also became we had to keep shifting the telescope to keep them in focus.

To whom it may concern:

If at all possible & would appreciate someone informing me of any action that is taking concerning these sightings, or letting me know if there is an explanation for these things.
