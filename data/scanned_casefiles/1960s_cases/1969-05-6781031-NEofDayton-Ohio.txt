The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

This bright light field appeared somewhat near to the object and slightly below it. It appeared to be some sort of side effect or distortion. It appeared to be about 75 yards from the observer. The object was observed through binoculars. It appeared to be rounded and solid looking. There seemed to one other sighting to be the intensity from binoculars. The object was observed for about 15-20 minutes and then slowly faded out of sight. The night was somewhat hazy and there were some ground hazes and mirages observed on this night. This appears to be a detailed account of a UFO sighting.

Colonel, USAF, Chief of the Aerial Phenomena Office, regarding a report on file (#17355). The letter thanks Quintanillas for the information provided and states that if any further word is received on the report, it will be shared.

Dear Col. Quintanillas:

Thank you for your letter of June 26th and for the attached information relating to UFO Report #17355. 

In placing both reports (yours and #17355) together on the map it appears both points saw the same object. If not, it would certainly merit a coincidence.

If I should happen to get any further word on this report (#17355) I will be certain to touch with you on the 26th inst.

Sincerely yours,

Text extracted from the document:

IN THIS SYSTEM OF PLOT'S, PLAN VIEW WEST LAST THREE THE ACTUAL FLYING OBJECT SEEN, APPEARED, MOVING IN WESTERLY DIRECTION. THE LARGE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED HOVERING OVER THE FIELD WITH SMALLER OBJECTS GOING OUT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS.
