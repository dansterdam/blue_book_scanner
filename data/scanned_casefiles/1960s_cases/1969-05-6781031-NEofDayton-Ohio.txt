This bright light just appeared at little to the right and slightly above our own altitude. It appeared to be constantly altering. It then seemed to be closing. It then seemed to divide into two lights. We thought a formation of several aircraft. It then got dimmer and several red-list lights seemed to follow it. And then they all disappeared. The color was first white, and several blending light, and then a greenish-white.

It was interesting to see these pilots as we had never seen any like it before.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Thank you for your letter of June 26th and for the attached information relating to VFON report #1735.

In placing both reports (yours and #1735) together on the map it appears both pilots saw the same object. If not, it was certainly quite a coincidence.

If I should happen to get any further word on this report (#1735) I will be certain to get in touch with you.

Sincerely yours,

Possible Identification of Smithsonian Report No. 1135

Mr. Herb Roth
Smithsonian Information Team Director
c/o United Airlines Flight Training Center
Stapleton International Airport
Denver, Colorado 80207

Reference your report no. 1735, latitude 40 27' North, longitude 086 52' West for 3 May 1969 near Dayton, Ohio. Attached is a possible identification which has been received for 2 May 1969 at 0215 EST (3/02150) from the co-pilot of a B-52. It was our satellite search, probably from the B-52 and near the area of some satellites debris, probably from 1967-71A (Explorer 34). It seems quite possible that this was a normal ground trace in computing the Greenwich Mean Time.

Here is the text from the image:

3A. NOW IMAGING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THEN CAREFULLY SHOW MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON IN THE LARGER SKETCH. CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
