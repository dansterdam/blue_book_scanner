I. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:
Intersection of V34 and V84+-35 is almost directly over the point of this sighting.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
V34 would appear to run from NW quadrant toward the East (Newburgh) from the point of sighting. Sighting could have been C-124 aircraft flying east on V74 toward Stewart AFB as this type of aircraft is new to the area and therefore strange. Also, it was relatively slowly and would show red and green lights (flashing).

None
