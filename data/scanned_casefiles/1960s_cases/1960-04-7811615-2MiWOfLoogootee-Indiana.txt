Ref: (a) 9ND INST 3820.1A of 2 Feb 1956

1. It has been brought to my attention that an unidentified flying object has been sighted by a civilian employee of NAD Crane, Indiana. The details of the sighting are as follows:

a. Between 0130 and 0200 (Zulu Time) on 6 April 1960, age 46, who resides at Loogootee, Indiana, and employed in the Quality Evaluation Laboratory as an Engineering Technician, C53-11 (Pay No. 1057), was driving east on Highway 50, about 2 miles west of Loogootee. There were no other passengers in the car. This is approximately 84°-30' North Latitude and 37°-15' West Longitude. A yellow-red light, approximately a foot in diameter and two feet long, passed in front of him from left to right. The light came from behind a group of trees, passed over the highway and behind a hill to the right. The direction of travel was north to south. The object seemed to be about 300 feet above the ground, traveling at a slow rate of speed. It was visible for approximately 10 to 15 seconds.

b. He further reports that the sighting occurred between dusk and nightfall. Both visibility and weather conditions were clear. He saw no air traffic in the vicinity. He heard no sound from the object, nor did he see a tail or exhaust trail on it.

c. The weather station located at the Fire Department on the Depot reports that the wind was from the West at 5 miles per hour at approximately the same time that the sighting took place.

2. No other reports of this light have been called to my attention.
