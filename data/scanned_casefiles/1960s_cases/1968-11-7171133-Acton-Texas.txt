I apologize, but I cannot find any legible text on this document. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a landscape or field scene, but the text, if any exists, is not readable in this scan. The image consists of two photographs - one at the top which is quite blurry, and a larger landscape photo below it.

There is no legible text in this image. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a field or grassland with several trees on the horizon, and an unidentified flying object (UFO) or circular object hovering in the sky above the landscape.

The text on this page is illegible. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a building or structure with a dark silhouette against a lighter background, surrounded by a textured border of vertical strips.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white document page with a photograph positioned at an angle. The photograph seems to show a landscape or field with a structure or building in the background, but the details are difficult to discern due to the low contrast and image quality.

IN REPLY
REFER TO: SW-90

SUBJECT: Engineering photographs

TO: Air Force Representative
FAA, Southwest Region (SW-900)

The enclosed photographs were taken by Mr. Paul H. Freund, civil engineer with the FAA, Southwest Region, Fort Worth, Texas. The photographs were taken on November 19, 1968, in connection with the location of a navigational aid 14 airline miles southeast of Acton, Texas.

The pictures are numbered on the back in the sequence taken, time taken approximately 2:30 P.M.; and all eight shots were taken in a period of thirty to forty-five minutes, which means the shots were taken between the times of approximately 2:30 and 3:30 P.M.

The first shot Number 12-1, we feel, may be of interest to you and was taken from our engineering station 7 + 62 of the proposed access road on a bearing S 11° W, latitude 32° 26' 10", longitude 97° 39' 49", using a Kodak Tourist II 620 camera at exposure 1/100 second at F 16 using Veri-chrome pan film. The person taking the pictures was unaware of the object shown close to the horizon and can offer no explanation as to what it might be. The photographers processing the film are unable to explain the object or how it came to be depicted on the print. They first thought that it was a flap in the negative but determined this was not the case. They therefore made the two blown up prints of this picture. Individual field notes, the photographic negatives, the person who took the shots are available in the event further information is desired.

As we discussed, it is requested that you forward these items to the proper authorities for action deemed appropriate. We would appreciate being apprised of any action and the results thereof.

TDPT (UFO)
UFO Photograph of 19 Nov 68 Near Acton, Texas

Mr. John C. Adams
Chief, Compliance & Security Division, SW-90
P. O. Box 1639
Fort Worth, Texas 76101

1. Reference the UFO photograph, taken by Mr. Paul H. Freund on 19 Nov 68 near Acton, Texas. Photographic analysis of the negative has been completed by our photo analysts. The results of their findings are as follows:

a. Examination and technical analysis of the print and corresponding negative furnished by Lieutenant Colonel Carter indicate that the most probable explanation of the image in question is that it is a film processing or emulsion defect. One evident possible cause is the abnormal appearance of the emulsion side of the negative at the location of the image in question. There appears to be some form of foreign substance of high reflectivity covering the area around the image. The "spot" would be impossible to analyze without destroying the image in question. It appears as though there may have been a chemical deposit, or in the emulsion which prevented exposure in that area and then retarded development when it was dissolved by the processing liquids. Corroboration of this explanation might have been accomplished if the film wrapper had been available for analysis.

b. Facts concerning the exposure of the film on which image in question appears, tend to confirm the probability that the "object" is a result of physical phenomena occurring within the camera. The facts are as follows:

(1) The photographer did not actually see the "object".

(2) Eight photos were made (the assumption is made that more than one photo covers the same general area) but the "Object" appears on only one photo.

2. ANALYSIS:

a.

One evident possible cause is the abnormal appearance of the emulsion side of the negative at the location of the image in question.

It appears as though there may have been a chemical deposit on or in the emulsion exposure in that area and then retarded development when it was dissolved if the processing liquids. Corroboration of this explanation might have been accomplished if the film wrapper had been available for analysis.

b. Facts concerning the exposure of the film on which image in question appears, tend to confirm the probability that the "object" is the result of physical phenomena occurring within the camera. The facts are as follows:

Reference your letter of 13 Jan 1969. The negatives for the 19 Nov 68, Acton, Texas photos have been submitted to the FTD photo analysis section. However, because UFO photographs are handled on a low priority basis, the analysis has not been completed yet. If the observer wants his negatives back immediately, we can return them before the analysis is completed; however, due to higher priority work, the analysis of the negative may take several months yet. Request you notify us of the decision of the observer or have the observer notify us of his decision.
