SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

ON NOVEMBER 7, 1968, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:05 P.M., I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR ACTON, TEXAS. I WAS DRIVING EASTBOUND ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 20 WHEN I FIRST OBSERVED THE OBJECT. IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30-35 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SKY. THE OBJECT WAS ILLUMINED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT. THIS LIGHT PULSATED RHYTHMICALLY AT A RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 CYCLE PER SECOND. 

I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. DURING THIS TIME, IT REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS OR CHANGES IN SPEED OR DIRECTION. I DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. I AM SUBMITTING THIS REPORT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE OF VALUE TO YOUR DEPARTMENT IN INVESTIGATING REPORTED SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

SINCERELY,

DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE

The image contains an engineering photograph document from the Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration. The document mentions that the photographs were taken by Mr. Paul H. Freund, a civil engineer with the FAA, Southwest Region, in Fort Worth, Texas. The photographs depict a facility approximately 15 airline miles southeast of Acton, Texas. The document explains that the photographs were taken between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM, which means the shots were taken between thirty to forty-five minutes.

The document mentions that the first shot, number 12-1, may be of interest and was taken using a Kodak Ektrite II camera with a bearing of 119°W, latitude 32°26'10", longitude 97°39'49", using a Verichrome pan film. The person taking the pictures was unaware of the object shown in the photograph, and the photographers processing the film were unable to explain the object. They therefore made two blown-up prints of this picture, and the person who took the shots is available if further information is desired.

The engineering photographs were taken by Mr. Paul H. Freund, civil engineer with the FAA, Southwest Region, Fort Worth, Texas. The photographs were taken on November 19, 1968, in connection with a facility approximately 15 airline miles southeast of Acton, Texas.

The pictures were taken between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM, which means the shots were taken between thirty to forty-five minutes, which means the shots were taken between approximately 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM.

The first shot, Number 12-1, we feel, may be of interest to you and was taken using a Kodak Ektrite II camera with a bearing of 119°W, latitude 32°26'10", longitude 97°39'49", using a Verichrome pan film. The person taking the pictures was unaware of the object shown in the photograph, and the photographers processing the film were unable to explain the object. They therefore made the two blown-up prints of this picture. Individual field notes, the photographic negatives, and the person who took the shots are available in the event further information is desired.

As we discussed, it is requested that you forward these items to the proper authorities for action deemed appropriate. We would appreciate being apprised of any action and the results thereof.

TDPT (UFO)
UFO Photograph of 19 Nov 69 Near Acton, Texas

Mr. John C. Adams
Chief, Compliance & Security Division, SW-90
P. 0. Box 1539
San Antonio, Texas 78206

1. Reference the UFO photograph taken by Mr. Paul H. Freund on 19 Nov 69 near Acton, Texas. Photographic analysis of the negative has been completed by our photo analysis. The results are as follows:

a. Examination and technical analysis of the print and corresponding negative furnished by Lieutenant Colonel Carter indicates that no retouching or manipulation of the image is evident. The question is, then, what is the significance of the various shapes and patterns which appear on the image? One obvious cause is the appearance of the negatives to be secondary exposure or the "objects" appearing in question. There appears to be some form of foreign substance on the surface of the film which may have been introduced during processing or some other means. The spot would be impossible to analyze without destroying the image. It is queGition whether this substance was introduced by accident or whether the "object" itself may have been responsible for the formation of the image in question.

b. Facts concerning the exposure of the film on which image in question appears: tend to confirm the probability that the "object" is a result of physical phenomena occurring within the camera. The facts are as follows:

(1) The photographer did not actually see the "object".
(2) Eight photos were made (the assumption is made that more than one photo covers the same general area) but the "object" appears on only one photo.

- page 18 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The text at the top of the image states "The referenced photographic negative which you leaned to Lt Col Carter is enclosed." However, no photograph is visible in the image provided.

2. The text found in the document is as follows:

"2. The referenced photographic negative which you leaned to Lt Col Carter is enclosed. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

The image appears to contain a photograph analysis report for an "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" sighted in Acton, Texas on 19 November 1958. The report states that one 2x3¼ negative and 8x10 B&W print enlargement were provided as part of the photography. There is no further description or details about the contents of the photograph itself.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Acton, Texas
DATE 19 November 1958
PHOTOGRAPHY

P NRS One 2x3¼ negative and 8x10 B&W print enlargement
QUALITY Fair
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 68-110 submitted by Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla (TDFT) requesting analysis of a photograph taken near Acton, Texas, 19 November 1958, to determine the identity of a purported UFO.
2. ANALYSIS:
a. Examination and technical analysis of the print and corresponding negative furnished by Lieutenant Colonel Carter indicates that the most photograph examination is in regard to the image in the question. The apparent cause is the abnormal appearance of the emulsion side of the negative at the location of the image. There appears to be some distortion of the high reflective area around the image. The "spot" would be impossible to analyze without destroying the image in question. It appears as though there may have been a chemical damage or scratches to the emulsion of the negative which dissolved upon processing and standard development when the film wrapper had been available for some time. Corroboration of this film wrapper had been available for some time. Corroboration of this film wrapper condition might have been accomplished if the film wrapper had been available for examination.
b. Facts concerning the exposure of the film on which image in question appears, tend to show that the probability that the "subject" is the result of physical phenomena occurring within the camera.
(1) The photographer did not actually see the "object".
(2) Eight photos were made (the assumption is made that more than one photo covers the same general area) but the "object" appears on only one photo.
