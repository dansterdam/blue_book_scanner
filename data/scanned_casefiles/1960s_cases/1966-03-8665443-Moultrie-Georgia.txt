11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two witnesses sighted a big red circular object while driving in a car from Sale City to Moultrie, Georgia. Observer stated the object was on the west side of his car, also stated that it was over the front right of the car. A check of the local map revealed that in order for the object to be in front of the car it must be in the east. When first sighted it was stationary and seemed to be a great distance away. It seemed to move over the road and come down toward them. When the witness stopped the car the object stopped also. He then said that it seemed to be 50 yards in front of him and shaped like a big tilted cup. When he stared moving the object started moving again also. Witness evidently had some thought on the object being the moon since he stated that he asked the passenger if she had ever seen the moon when it was red. The moon is approaching the last quarter and rises at approximately the same time as the sighting.

Dear Sirs:

The purpose of this letter is to report an unidentified flying object on the night of March 2, 1966 at approximately 12:30 A.M. between State City and Moultrie, Georgia.

I am writing this letter now at the risk of ridicule, or being called a crackpot. I was not going to report it to any officials, because of obvious reasons. But since I, along with my father, spotted this shall we say phenomena, I have talked to some very intellectual people about my experience on the night of March 2.

They didn't seem to think that it was a laughing matter, or a crackpot illusion. So I decide to report it, and to inquire if anyone else!

other than my mother and myself has
reported a U.F.O. on that night and
of the same, following description:
I was driving home, at Moultrie from
Dale City, when I saw a bright red,
circular object out in an open
field, to the west side of my car,
it was stationary in the sky, and
it seemed to be a great distance
away. I called my mother's attention
to it, and I asked her if she had
ever seen the moon where it was
bright red, she answered no. So we
both continued to watch it as I
drove. I went about a mile further,
when I saw the thing started moving,
it was moving quickly, smoothly
but unevenly. Only a few seconds
passed before it was directly over

the road, and it seemed to be coming right on down into us. I stopped my car and jumped out, and it, whatever it was, stopped also. it was about fifty yards in front of us, and approximately fifty feet above the road, it was a very bright red. at that distance, it looked as though it was about the size of a big car, shaped like a big tilted cup -> . I got back into my car and proceeded forward slowly. it also proceeded forward, staying about the same distance in front of my car. it went on that way for about a quarter of a mile, then it came down to an altitude of about ten feet above the road, and then it gradually blacked out.

I went about a half mile further and it came on again, bright red this time it was about fifty feet high, and over to the right of the road and about a hundred feet in front of us, traveling forward. We went on a few miles like that, then it came back over the road again. I slowed up it about five miles or so. Another car was coming (this one, it stayed about a thousand feet behind me) so evidently the people in that car saw it too. I went around a curve, but the thing did not change course this time, so now it was back over the front right, right over the tree tops. It traveled in that position the rest of the way to Moultrie, in a

following course. And it remained
brilliantly visible until we got
to the edge of town, where buildings
abstracted our view. When I got on
into town, I stopped where two
police officers were standing and
asked them if they saw anything.
But there were buildings on either
side of them, and they seemed to
think that my mother and I were
imagining things. If they had any
intelligence whatever, they'd have
known that two people do not imagine
the same phenomena at the same
time.

Well, you people might think that
I'm off my rocker, but what else
written here is so true that I,
and my mother, would submit it.

a lie detector test, or any type of
of truth serum if it was necessary
to back up what we saw.

I've just heard on the radio that
a u.f.o. was spotted by fifty two people
in Michigan and Indiana. Could there
be some connection?

We would deeply appreciate a
reply and if you had any other
reports on that night.

It was not a helicopter, not a
plane. I have been in the service
and I can spot conventional
aircraft. And I failed to mention
that over phenomena was silent.
it made no sound whatever.
