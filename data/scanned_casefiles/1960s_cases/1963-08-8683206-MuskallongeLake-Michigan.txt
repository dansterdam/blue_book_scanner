Sighting #12 was on Friday
aug. 9, 1963 at 10:40 P.M.
object appeared to be
triangular in shape with
outer edge illuminated
more or less uniformly.
This object was settling
a vapor trail, with little
a comma trail. After trail
it came to a distinct
point then by going the
object a downward short
flight. To left sighted
about 45° off the east
horizon, looking west
DEL. little or no clouds
30 to 40 deg. east could
not confirm to a single

This image appears to be a detailed map, specifically of what seems to be a region in Michigan. The map shows numerous county or township boundaries, roads, and various geographical features. On the right side of the map, there is a legend with various symbols and notations, though the text is too small to read clearly. The map is black and white and appears to be from an older document, with a slightly faded and worn appearance typical of mid-20th century archival materials.

This image appears to be a map of a region, likely in Michigan near Muskallonge Lake based on the filename. The map shows a detailed grid of roads, geographical features, and boundaries. The map is in black and white and appears to be an older, possibly vintage map with a somewhat faded and grainy appearance. The map covers what seems to be a significant portion of a county or region, with numerous roads, townships, and possibly water bodies represented by various lines and markings.

This image appears to be a detailed road map of a region, likely in Michigan. The map includes:

Legend on the right side with road type classifications:
- Expressway
- Federal Road
- Other Road
- Unimproved Road

The map shows numerous county boundaries, roads, highways, and what seem to be parks or national forests. There are many labeled locations and route numbers throughout the map. The map covers a large geographic area with a grid-like structure of roads and county lines. The map is in black and white and appears to be from an older document, consistent with the 1960s timeframe mentioned in the filename.

This image appears to be a map of Michigan, showing various cities, roads, and geographical features. At the top right of the map, there is a small box labeled "TRADE CANADA HIGHWAYS". The map is divided into sections and includes numerous place names and road networks across the state. The map is in black and white and appears to be from an older document, with a slightly faded and grainy appearance typical of mid-20th century cartographic materials.

The words "Period" can be partially seen at the top left of the map, though the full word is cut off. The map shows detailed road connections between various cities and regions of Michigan, with some areas more densely populated with roads and towns than others.
