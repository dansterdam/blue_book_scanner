The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an old Project Blue Book record card from 1963. The card contains information about an unidentified object sighting that occurred on 7 Aug 63 near Muskallonge Lake, Michigan. The sighting is described as a light "2X as bright as RC (ID)" and brighter than any star visible, observed in flight to the NE. The speed was 10x ECHO, believed to be in the atmosphere, and it was observed from 70 deg elevation in the NE to 30 deg elevation where it faded.
