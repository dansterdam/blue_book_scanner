The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing sketches and instructions for reporting observed UFO sightings.

The text obtained through OCR is as follows:

"32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

A B was a very small obj ect and appeared to be moving in the sky, but steadily less when I 10 sec. later. 

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch."

You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important.

NAME: [REDACTED]
SIGNATURE: [REDACTED]
DATE: September 7, 1962

I first noticed the description following a USAF tracking station observation at 0545 hours on 9-5-62. I observed the very white light at about 30 degrees elevation and moving rapidly north to south. After approximately 15 minutes, this very bright light suddenly stopped and hovered for a short period. Then it turned in a northeast direction and accelerated very rapidly and disappeared from view. I have found no satisfactory explanation for the incident.

Dear Sir,

After studying these newspaper accounts and having a number of conversations in regard to the U F O seen over the area on January 30, I am writing to provide you the report of my findings.

1) I would like to interview the witnesses of the incident s personally and obtain their signed statements. This would enable me to make a more complete and accurate report to you.

2) The people "who witnessed this incident refuse to give me their identities. They feel that, by doing so, their privacy and present occupations might be jeopardized. I would like to encourage them to come forward, but I must respect their wishes.

3) Mr. Becker's report was based on information received from a reliable source, i.e., the report by my wife to me.

Sincerely,

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a Project Blue Book report document.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? The single object was about 2-3 feet diameter.

We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? About 1/8 of the match head covered the object.

Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Appeared to vanish and disappeared.

In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. A bright (I have never seen one but the description sounds similar), or a large reflective where shock were with possibly some object that seemed to change in direction. It reflected the rays of the settling sun.
