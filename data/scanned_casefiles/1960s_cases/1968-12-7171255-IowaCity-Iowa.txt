The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a sketch with instructions on how to estimate the height of a UFO sighting based on the horizon line and compass directions. There is also a compass rose diagram to help with the estimation. Additionally, the image includes a request to draw a picture depicting the motion and direction of the UFO or object observed.

Official U.S. Air Force!
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object you observed (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.
