Dear sir,
On August 9th between 3:00 A.M. and 3:30 A.M. I sighted an unidentified flying object. It was a bluish object and a rather intense light. This object was at a constant altitude and seemed to hover. After about 1 minute, it made a sharp turn and went out of sight. 
For a part it seemed to have rings around it.
I could not identify the object. Is there any way this can be reported or investigated? I have no idea what it could have been.
3:30 A.M. & except to what extent of charge this did you could not right understand.
I have looked for it since, but no avail.
