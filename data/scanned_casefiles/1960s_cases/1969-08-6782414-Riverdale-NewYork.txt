Dear Sirs,

On August 9th between 3:00 A.M. and 3:30 A.M. I sighted an unidentified flying object. It was a large and a bright white object. It was stationary but changed planes, when it dipped it was possible to see a bulbous center part. It resembled the planet Saturn in that it seemed to have rings around.

I have never sighted such an object. Do you have any idea what it could have been? Did anyone else report such a sighting? At 3:30 a.m. I went to sleep and thereafter, I have not sighted it forwards. I have looked for it since then, but to no avail.

Sincerely,
