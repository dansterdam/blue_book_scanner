1.   In the basic letter, four questions were asked concerning the flying object (UFO) report and the inclosed photographs and soil samples. The following information was developed
in reply to the four questions and may be helpful in your evaluation.

2.   With reference to the first question concerning a
feasible explanation for the cause of the impressions in the
sand, the following paragraphs describe the limited laboratory
study which provided relevant information.

Site Information

a.   These Laboratories have on file numerous Corps
of Engineer Condition Survey or Airfield Pavement Evaluation
reports of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Although the information in these reports primarily relates to the airfield,
general observations of soil and climatic conditions apply to
the location of the UFO observance.

b.   The climate in the area is generally arid.
Rainfall in the fall months averages about 0.75 inches per
month.   Free ground water is rarely found at depths less than
200 feet.

c.   The natural subgrade soils in the area consist
mainly of sand (SC-SM), gravel (GP), and sandy clay (CL) in
various proportions with an appreciable filling of lime carbonate.
Sandy clays occur in many areas to depths of at least six feet,
and caliche materials, ranging from a loose to medium dense
structure, are of common occurrence at depths varying from three
to six feet.

d.   The strength of these dry soils is low in their natural uncompacted state. The modulus of subgrade reaction is on the order of 100 psi per inch. This measure of soil strength is significant because of the way in which test values are obtained. The test procedure involves applying a static load to a 30-inch diameter plate and observing the indentation below the ground surface.

Air Force Photographs

e.   For convenience in discussion, the Air Force photographs have been assigned the arbitrary numbers A1 through A7.

f.   Photographs A1 through A3 show many footprints indicating sandy material that is both dry and loose. The footprints near the impressions indicate a sinkage of about 1/2 inch which implies a material that could be easily disturbed by shoveling.   Static loading on a circular footing of approximately 24-inch diameter would induce a heaving failure including a raised lip outside the footing. However, the cross section of the lip would show a rounded rather than a sharply peaked shape.

g.   Photographs A3 through A6 indicate areas immediately adjacent to the depressions that appear smooth. The overall appearance suggests a flattening of the loose surface material by a flat board or the back of a shovel.

h.   The shape of the raised lip (Photographs A2, A3, and A6) is sharply peaked. This sharp lip is not characteristic of soil failure due to either static surface loads or to ejecta from high-velocity impact.

i.   Photographs A2 through A6 reveal disturbances on the inside of the depressions which further rule out static loading. These disturbances are aligned along a diameter of

each depression and consist of a ridge of material built up
on the inside surface of each depression. The ridge is not
uniform in height but is divided and curved as shown by Photo-
graphs A3 through A6. The inside surface of the depression
other than the ridge appears smooth but less compacted than
the ground surface of the immediate vicinity.

Simulation Tests

j.   In an effort to simulate the observed depressions,
these Laboratories conducted a limited series of tests based
on the hypothesis that some mechanism other than static or dy-
namic loading produced the unique appearance.

k.   A standard sieve analysis completed on the ma-
terial sent to us from the site revealed a sandy material similar
in gradation to bank run sands present in the Cincinnati area.
A gravel pit near the Laboratories has sand of similar gradation
to the Arizona sand and was selected as a site for field testing.

l.   The ridges in the left-hand depression of Photo-
graph A6 appear to be the result of a rotational digging action.
To test this hypothesis, simulation tests in the laboratory and
in the field were completed and recorded on Photographs 01 through
07. Photographs 01 through 03 were taken in the laboratory using
dry sand. The remaining photographs were taken at the nearby
gravel pit.

m.   The device used to make depressions in the labora-
tory was a steel plate measuring 6" x 7" x 1/2". Photographs
01 and 02 show the pattern developed after standing the plate
on edge and forcing it, corner foremost, into the sand and
turning it counterclockwise. The sand was level and smooth
at the start of each test. The raised lip with its sharp crest
was caused by spillage around the leading edges of the plate
and not by displacement. The ridge was formed by simply stopping

the rotation and removing the plate vertically. However, the
resultant ridge appeared too large in comparison with the
Arizona disturbances.    Photograph 03 shows that the volume of
the ridge can be reduced while still retaining the sharp peaked
toroidal lip.    This depression was started in the same way as
the previous tests except that several handfuls were scooped
from the bottom of the depression after which the steel plate
was again rotated.    The 7-inch edge of the plate was parallel
to the ground surface during the rotation which was completed
after the scooping operation.

n.    Photographs 04 through 07 record the tests com-
pleted in the field.    The large piece of plywood shown on Photo-
graph 05 produced all depressions in this test series.    The
principle difficulty with these tests was the existing natural
water content of the sand.    The material did not flow as readily
as the dry sand tested in the laboratory and left marked stria-
tions along the sides of the depression.    We were unable to obtain photo-
graphs of the freshly made depressions because of malfunctioning
equipment.    Photographs 04, 06, and 07 were, however, made a
week after testing and indicate a softening of the material due
to weathering.    Photographs A4, A5 and A6 show some breakdown
in structure along the lip presenting the possibility of the
start of weathering.    Photograph A5 was made during the second
visit to the gravel pit and shows the effect of moisture on the
configuration of a freshly-dug depression.    All of these de-
pressions approximate the dimensions of the Arizona disturbances.
The bottoms of the depressions in each case contained loose ma-
terial.

Summary - First Question

o.    The shape and depth of the depressions rule out
the possibility of either static or dynamic loading applied
through 24-inch diameter footings.

p.    The general appearance of the depressions can
be duplicated by rotating a vertically oriented, flat plate
in loose sand.

3. With reference to the second question concerning the weight necessary to make an impression of the size reported, the strength of dry soils can be based on a static load test on a flat plate. The estimated modulus of subgrade reaction for the general area is about 100 psi per inch. If a two-foot diameter plate is loaded statically on such a material, approximately 500 psi would be required to produce the observed penetration of 4 inches below the ground surface. The loading intensity and penetration depth corresponds to a total static load of about 230,000 pounds. Assuming that each pad or vehicle support carried the same load, the total weight of the object would be about 460,000 pounds. If the observed object was solid steel, the required vehicle size (volume) would be still over nine times larger than the 4-foot diameter by 8-foot high object described.

4. The estimated modulus of subgrade reaction of about 100 psi per inch used above was the minimum found for the area in the site data. The soil sample furnished and assuming a low moisture content for the soil, based on the photographs, would indicate that the modulus of subgrade reaction would be in the range of 300 psi per inch. The higher the actual modulus, the greater the weight would have to be to produce the observed penetration. On site tests could provide a more accurate value, if necessary, for the modulus.

5. As described in paragraph 2m and 2n, the depressions that we produced in the laboratory and in the field were made by a single individual whose height and weight are 5'8" and 180 pounds. This person required moderate effort to turn and embed the plate into the soil.

6. With reference to the third question of whether it would be feasible for a two-legged object of the shape described to make the depressions, the object sketched would be inherently unstable unless it contained some sort of stabilizing mechanism or the two legs penetrated deeply into the soil.

7.   With reference to the fourth question of whether it would be possible for a vehicle to make a deep depression and leave a lip like those in the photographs, the results of the laboratory study provide some insight into ways the depression can be duplicated. Based on required weight and stability, it does not seem reasonable that a vehicle would produce the depressions. Such depressions, however, were reproduced with little difficulty by a single individual.

This case contains 7, 8×10" photos

Investigations were covered as shown here when the investigation personal arrived. This cover was placed by Dr. James McDonald of the University of Arizona who after here took pictures on the night of 7 October, 1967.

At the bottom of the page, there is a notation "N-1".


- page 42 -

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing what seems to be a damaged or crashed object lying on rocky or uneven terrain. The object looks fragmented or broken into angular pieces, with a distinct shape that suggests it might be part of a vehicle or aircraft. The surrounding area appears to be a rough, rocky landscape with some vegetation or rocky outcroppings visible in the background. The image is grainy and has low contrast, typical of older photographic documentation.

TPPT (UFO) Maj Quintanilla/70916/mhs/12 Feb 68
UFO Observation, 9 October 1967

12th Strategic Aerospace Division (EXI)
Attn: Captain Claude S. Deen

1. Reference the unidentified observation of 9 October 1967, Tucson, Arizona by Charles Easter.

2. The soil samples and photographs that you sent to us were forwarded to the Ohio River Division Laboratories at Cincinnati, Ohio, for their comments. As you can see by reading the attached report, they show that the "landing" is almost undoubtedly a hoax.

3. Thank you for your assistance and efforts in providing a comprehensive report on this alleged landing. Your report has enabled the Ohio River Division Laboratories to supply us with their comments on this incident.

Dear Mr. Mellinger

I wish to express my sincere appreciation for your excellent
report of 17 January 1968 which you submitted to the Aerial
Phenomena Office. Your comprehensive report has enabled
my UFO Office to properly evaluate the alleged Tucson UFO
incident as a hoax.

Once again, thank you for the assistance you have given to
the Foreign Technology Division.

OFFICE OF PREPARATION: TDPT (UFO)

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation

SUMMARY:
Upon our request, the Ohio River Division Laboratories provided pertinent Information relating to an alleged UFO landing near Tucson, Arizona. It was necessary to obtain the additional information on the sighting since Dr. James McDonald "private" UFO investigator" of the University of Arizona also investigated the report and to back up our belief that the sighting was a hoax. The report is one of the most comprehensive and scientific reports that has been presented to the Aerial Phenomena Office on a UFO sighting. For this reason, I feel that a Letter of Appreciation should be sent to Mr. Mellinger of the Army Engineers Division to express our thanks for a job well done.

At the bottom of the form, there is a note: "Do not forward to Command Section until this block has been signed and dated by the appropriate OPR. This block, when signed, signifies completed coordination and that the OPR is aware of concurrence, non-concurrence and either resolution of difference or why the non-concurrence should be overridden."

The form is from AFSC FORM 149 OCT 63, with a note that "PREVIOUS EDITION OF THIS FORM MAY BE USED."
