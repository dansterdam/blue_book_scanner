The incident was reported to have occurred at approximately 1:30 PM on 7 August 1968 near Jeffersonville, Indiana. The witness was driving on U.S. Highway 31W near the North Fork of the Ohio River when he observed a large, metallic, disc-shaped object approximately 100 feet in diameter hovering at an estimated altitude of 50 feet above the ground. The object was described as having a silver or metallic gray color and was observed to suddenly accelerate and depart the area at a high rate of speed. The witness stated that the object made no sound and displayed no visible means of propulsion. No other witnesses were reported.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of a landscape with mountains or hills in the distance. The text below the sketch provides instructions on how to describe any photograph that may be present, but in this case there is no photograph, only the sketch.

Transcribing the text from the document:

No Exhaust
No Vapors 
No Noise
No Percussion

This is about how to estimate the size of the object in comparison to a known object, such as a match held at arm's length in front of a known object. The text indicates that the object could only partially cover or obscure the known object when held at a certain distance, and the fraction of the known object covered could be estimated.

The text then states that "Length would just about cover the object when first sighted, but would only half cover it as it went overhead."

UFO Observation, 3 August 1959

Mr.  
Jeffersonville, Indiana 47130

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 3 August 1959. The description that you provided on your observation suggests that you have observed what we have classified as plastic target bags, not air balloons. These balloons usually appear as a white or yellow color, and usually lase birthday candles for a heat source. After the candle is burned out, the balloon deflates and disappears from the object. Shortly after the fiery pieces fall, the light disappears.

2. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
