It appeared to be a very high intensity - ball shaped light, visible from 30° (even though I saw about 170° of it). It appeared to be self-luminous. It grew smaller as it continued away but did not lose brilliance.

It did not seem to project any light onto the ground.
It did not blink or change in any form until it disintegrated.

Edges were fairly clear as I was searching all around it for some sort of projection.

[Checkbox section with various phenomena characteristics, with some "X" marks]

A NEIGHBOR SAID QUOTE: LOOK AT THE BRIGHT LIGHT ON THIS AIRPLANE. I LOOKED AND IMMEDIATELY STATED THAT IT HAD LEFT THE LANDING LIGHT ON. THEN AFTER OBSERVING A FEW MORE SECONDS, SAID - THAT'S NO LANDING LIGHT - THAT PUT ON AN AIRPLANE EITHER. AS IT CAME OVER NEAR, I SUSPECTED THAT WE LISTEN FOR ENGINES - WE DID AND THERE WAS NONE.

AFTER IT PASSED OVER HEAD IT CONTINUED ON A STRAIGHT COURSE FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES. IT THEN APPEARED TO TURN RIGHT GENTLY ABOUT 5° TO 10°. IT THEN STRAIGHTENED OUT AND A FEW SECONDS LATER, DISINTEGRATED. 5-6 PIECES FELL TO THE GROUND LIKE BURNING PHOSPHORUS AND ALL WENT OUT BUT ONE WHEN I LOST SIGHT OF IT AS IT CAME TO CLOSE TO THE GROUND.

DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR WHEN IT DISINTEGRATED AND STARTED TO FALL TO THE GROUND.

I CLIMBED OUT TO A STATION-WAGON TO KEEP IT IN VIEW AS LONG AS I COULD BUT THE HOUSE FINALLY OBSCURED MY VIEW.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAIL THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXACTLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

Flight path represents
overhead and to the left.

No Exhaust
No Vapors
No Noise
No Protrusions

Flight path represents
overhead and to the left.

This is about how object appeared the first few
seconds it came into view.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TELEPHONE POLE. NOT HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH, NOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

In my opinion a match head held at arm's
length would just about cover the object when
first sighted, but would only half cover it as
it went overhead.

TPPT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mhs/31 Aug 68
UFO Observation, 3 August 1968

Mr [redacted]
Jeffersonville, Indiana 47130

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 3 August 1968. The description that you provided on your observation, is consistent with other reports that we have received of plastic garnet bag hot air balloons. These balloons usually appear as a luminescent object that is red, orange, yellow or white in color, and usually uses birthday candles for a heat source. After the candles burn down, the stage or platform on which the candles are mounted on sometimes catches fire and sparks can be seen falling from the object. Shortly after the Fiery pieces fall, the light dims and disappears.

2. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

18. SPEED OF PHENOMENON: 200 MPH
19. DISTANCE OF PHENOMENON: 3600 FT.

20. IN ORDER THAT WE MAY OBTAIN AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, DESCRIBE IN YOUR OWN WORDS A COMMON OBJECT OR COMPARISON WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU NOTED THE PHENOMENON, WOULD BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT YOU SAW. DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMMON OBJECT AND WHAT YOU SAW:

A ROUND ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB WOULD PROBABLY COME AS CLOSE TO WHAT THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE AS ANYTHING ELSE. THE TYPE OF LIGHT BEFORE FROSTED GLASS. IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE SOFT AND PLEASING. ALSO IT SEEMED TO COME CLOSER TO THE REDDISH TYPE LIGHT THAN THE WHITE TYPE LIGHT.

Having received training as a Tactical Reconnaissance Pilot and adding 91 Combat Missions from 3000 ft. to tree top level, over France & Germany, certainly does NOT give a person much background to properly identify U.F.O.s. It does however help to determine maps, degrees, elapsed time, altitude, speed & weather to mention a few.

SINCE THE CLOUD COVERAGE WAS ABOUT 95%
AND AT 10,000 TO 12,000 FT, IT SEEMS LOGICAL
THAT THE OBJECT WAS UNDER 10,000 FT.
YOU COULD TELL WHERE THE MOON WAS
LOCATED IN THE SKY BECAUSE OF THE
LIGHT AREA. YOU COULD ALSO SEE A 3/4
MOON THROUGH A HOLE IN THE OVERCAST
EVERY 5 OR 10 MINUTES.
