11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Tower operator first noticed flashing lights. Objects appeared to have ±lor of between 020 and 045 deg at az of 50 to 075 deg. Of the 7 objects reported visually, 4 persisted longer. These objects seemed to be in formation and they varied in their flight paths. Their main change was in alt. They appeared to move and then rise in a near vertical direction. These objects looked alike and on other stars and after a while they just seemed to blend in with the other stars. The other objects just gradually faded from view at an alt. There was no Radar contact came from relatively dispersed areas. All the contacts contained were difficult to hold because of slow speeds involved. The height finding radar similarly had little luck in giving valid changes in alt. There was no overall discernible pattern to the flight paths of the objects when considered as a whole.

ATTN OF: FTDF

SUBJECT: UFO

TO: FTID (DDOC)
Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio

1. The following report of UFOs is submitted per para. 14, AFR 200-2
and 200-2A:

a. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:

(1) All objects had the general shape and appearance of stars.

(2) The largest appeared to be twice the size of an ordinary
star. The others were the same size as stars which would make them
about the size of a pinhead when held at arms length.

(3) The objects were the same color as stars.

(4) There were from 7 to 12 objects involved.

(5) There was no discernible formation with one exception. Three
of the objects appeared to be in what might roughly be described as an
inverted "V".

(6) The objects that were held visually appeared to be flashing
red, green and white lights at one time or another.

(7) None

(8) None

(9) One of the objects was reported as "pushing a small cloud"
in front of it. This is the one object that could be explained. It was
a weather balloon.

b. DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECTS:

(1) The Edwards tower operator first noticed flashing lights
from these objects in the normal course of his duties.

(2) The first and most prominent of these objects was originally
sighted at an elevation of 010° and an azimuth of 062°. The other objects
[remainder of text is illegible]

UNCLASSIFIED

appeared to have an elevation of between 080 and 090° and azimuths of
050 to 075°. It is impossible to determine just which of the radar
contacts correlate with the visual sightings. There were reports of up
to 12 radar contacts from relatively dispersed sites. HAADS received
reports at various times from San Pedro, Laguna, March AFB, and Brown.
All were able to show contacts in the area under consideration at one
time or another during the 4-hour period. The duration of most of
these contacts was very short. The three contacts which eventually
figured in the decision to scramble were 1000, 1021, and 1092. HAADS
in this case contacts in a close enough proximity to those under
visual observation that there is a possibility that they were the same.

(3) Of the seven objects reported visually, four persisted
longer than the others. The brightness, most significant of these was
seen flashing at an elevation of approximately 050° and an azimuth of
135°. The other three were in what might be called a scattered arc an
inverted "V" and were last seen flashing at an elevation of 090° and
azimuths of from 140 to 150°. The remaining three, which were visible
for a shorter period of time, disappeared at approximately 045° elevation
and in the vicinity of 060 to 090° azimuth.

(4) The objects varied in their flight paths. A general statement might be made that their main change was in altitude. There were
definite changes in azimuth but these were relatively small. The four
digits seen most clearly probably were 0330, then side of a vertical
direction. Only a general statement about the radar tracks is possible.
All the contacts obtained on search radar were difficult to hold because
of slow speeds involved. The height finding radar similarly had little
luck in giving valid changes in altitude. There was no overall discernible pattern to the flight paths of objects when considered as a whole.

(5) Three of the objects held visually just gradually faded from
view. The four objects that were seen most clearly, i.e., the very bright
objects and the three in an inverted "V" seemed to take their place among
the stars and persisted, looking like all the other stars, until dawn.
These objects possibly "rode like the others and were replaced in the
eyes of the observers by stars that happened to be in the area of last
sighting.

(6) Again the objects were visible for varying lengths of time.
The first observation took place at 0330 (0133 PDT). The four most prominent objects flashed for about two hours. As mentioned above, these objects persisted until dawn although they ceased flashing after two hours. The
other three objects were visible for approximately 30 minutes.

c. MANNER OF OBSERVATION:

(1) The objects were observed both visually and electronically from the ground. Search, height finding, and approach radar all held the objects.

(2) All ground observers used 7x50 binoculars.

(3) N/A

d. TIME AND DATE OF SIGHTING:

(1) 7 October 1965, 0133Z

(2) Night

e. LOCATION OF OBSERVERS:

(1) The observers were located at base operations, Edwards AFB, Calif.

f. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ON OBSERVERS:

(1) Darryl Clark, Capt, 329th FIS, George AFB, Calif., Pilot. Capt. Clark is an alert pilot with Det. 1 at Edwards AFB. He happened to be on duty and was called upon to observe. The activity. His observers were all made from the ground.

(2) Charles A. Sorrells, SSgt, 1925 Communications Sq, AFCS, tower operator.

(3) Forrest S. Nonen, SSgt, Hq Sq Section, 6510th AB Group, Edwards AFB, dispatcher.

(4) Keith C. Peneau, A2C, Det. 21, 6th Weather Wg, weather observer.

All these observers are proficient in their particular jobs and could be classified as very reliable.

g. WEATHER AND WINDS-ALOFT CONDITIONS AT TIME AND PLACE OF SIGHTING:

(1) All observers agree that weather was clear and visibility good.

b. ANY OTHER UNUSUAL ACTIVITY OR CONDITION:
(1) None

1. INTERCEPTION OR IDENTIFICATION ACTION TAKEN:
An F-105 was scrambled from George AFB at 1202 (0509 PDT). The aircraft was controlled throughout its search on a visual basis by the forward tower. By the time the aircraft was scrambled, the activity was just about over. The objects that were held visually had ceased flashing and had taken on the appearance of ordinary stars as mentioned earlier. Radar contact was some or was of insufficient duration to be used in

vectoring the aircraft. Passes were made through the area at 15,000, 20,000, and 40,000 ft. The only thing out of the ordinary reported by the pilot was reflection of red lights from the dry lake bed near Edwards. He felt that these were reflections from something other than beacons in the area.

J. DURING the period of the sightings there was no air traffic nor were there balloon releases that night have been mistaken for the objects.

k. COMMENTS:

It was approximately 1000Z (0300 PDT) when I arrived at Edwards base operations. The activity level had subsided by that time but the tower operator still claimed to hold flashing lights on two or the four objects under observation. I was able to observe the objects but I cannot positively say that I saw flashing lights. The objects looked like ordinary stars. One of the objects pointed out was very brilliant but not so brilliant as to preclude its being a star. At times a couple of the objects did seem to flicker but I certainly saw no distinct intermittent flashing. I should mention here that what I observed was at the tail end of the activity and according to the observers was not representative of what they had seen earlier.

The Los Angeles Air Defense Sector made tapes of most of the conversations that took place during the incident. These tapes are time consuming and much of the information is not very legible. I have included as an attachment a catalog of the more important points on the tapes. If a recording with a revolution marker was made not following the chronological pattern. I listening to the tapes, you will find that the azimuths given in the report differ slightly from those quoted by the observers. I have corrected azimuths using charts and the reference points given.

There are two portions of the taped conversation which necessitate elaboration. The first of these concerns an eight object held visually (method: only briefly; in the body of the report). I saw this object quite clearly myself. It was said by those who saw the earlier activity to be persistently or what they had seen. There were two exceptions in that it flashed only white/red, showing no green, and that it displayed more lateral movement. Generally, however, it behaved as the other had. This object turned out to be the 1200Z (0500 PDT) weather balloon released from Edwards. Although this was the only balloon release during the period under study, I think it may be significant that this object behaved somewhat like balloons.

Here is the text from the document:

The other portion of the taped conversation that needs further elaboration deals with a seemingly unrelated report. After the activity had ended, LAADS received a phone call from L.A. Center (FAA) at Palmdale.

The supervisor had been called by an employee of the telephone company who, in turn, had talked to a waitress at a restaurant to whom a customer had related a wild story. At this point, you can see from the FAA alleged original source the report had come. The source was reported to have been traveling on a desolate stretch of Highway 138 between Victorville and Lancaster when he spotted a bright red object hovering near the road. It crossed the highway passing over his car, paralleled the highway, and then went straight up at a high rate of speed. I have never been able to locate the man who related the story to the waitress.

Mr. Meredith, an employee of Pacific Telephone, was the man who called to the waitress. I contacted him several times, but he was never able to provide the name of the man with whom he had spoken. Mr. Meredith did say that he understood that the man had been drinking and that he had been visiting a girlfriend in Victorville. After calling this man, the man had to work. This supposedly is the reason the original source is reluctant to relate his hand and core forward with his story.

In summary, no one in the Air Defense Sector could provide a plausible explanation, nor did they seem overly concerned once the incident was over. Their experience and the sources of information available to them provided little concern and some sources of information to them provided little concern.

I am very skeptical of this portion of the incident. People at the telephone company and all about the incident's activity lines were passed over their lines. I am even more inclined to consider it a hoax and calling with Mr. Meredith. While he was very cooperative, he seemed not to blow his small part in the happenings out of proportion.

As I mentioned earlier, the radar contacts are impossible to sort out and definitely point to the object having been virtually stationary. Until then, they held nothing unusual in the area. Included in the material being forwarded are rolls of 35mm Kodachrome film from the Defense Sector. The cameras were on from 09:72 (247 PDT) to 12:03 (350 PDT). Unidentified tracks were carried under the following numbers: (1090, 1091, 1092, 1093 (U02 and U03). At the height of the flashing activity, a civilian aircraft did pass near the area at 10:30 PM. The pilot was queried by FAA and reported that he had seen nothing unusual.

In summary, no one in the Air Defense Sector could provide a plausible explanation, nor did they seem overly concerned once the incident was over. Their experience and the sources of information available to them provided little concern to them.

no help. There seems to be no question that they did have radar control at several sites. The ground observers claim definitely to have seen flashing lights for which they could offer no explanation.

Everyone concerned at both TAADS and Edwards seem convinced that something unusual occurred.

1. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE:

These are radar scope photos which indicate unidentified contacts were held. These scope photos are being forwarded as a part of this report.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:    TDESD

SUBJECT:    Evaluation of Radar Scope Photos

TO:         TDEV/UFO

1. Reference is made to AFTC letter of 21 December 1965, subject "UFO", file FTF, reporting abnormal visual and radar sightings.
The following comments pertain to the radar observations:

a. It is impossible to make a thorough evaluation of this report and nomenclature of the radar in use, frequency of the radar, type of scope presentation (PPI, RHI, etc.), range scale (scope), and changes in operation made during the observations, if any. The following comments are, therefore, based on general radar conditions which may or may not be valid in this particular case.

b. The variations in the scope presentation are so extensive that it is practically impossible to determine normal fixed targets from changing ones. Many large, isolated returns, which are similar to returns from land masses or clouds appear, move, and disappear at random. Evaluating the photographs with the limited knowledge we have of the conditions, it appears that there are literally dozens of changing returns. The questions which naturally arise are:

(1) Is this weather radar?
(2) Was the antenna tilt angle varied?
(3) Was MKI or other circuit variations switched in or out during the observations?

c. It appears obvious that considering the large number of targets, the length of time observed, the general lack of appreciable speed in azimuth, their activity, these targets were not material targets such as aircraft, balloons, space vehicles, etc. This leaves a number of other possible sources which will be commented on individually and briefly.

a. Clouds. Apparently can be ruled out, because the report infers a relatively clear night, and clouds normally do not appear and disappear so quickly.

c. Operator error. No evidence or indication of this. Photos rule this out, as does coincident visual sightings.

f. Jamming. Normal jamming doesn't look like this. Visual sightings appear to rule this out.

g. Interference (man-made, or other radar). Doesn't normally look like this on the scope. Visual sightings would seem to eliminate this.

h. Equipment malfunction. Highly unlikely, primarily because of visual sightings, and also due to randomness of the returns.

i. Anomalous propagation. Although there evidently was no temperature inversion during this period, anomalous propagation is the most likely candidate for this situation, and could conceivably explain the visual sightings as well. Since light and radar waves are both electromagnetic in nature, variations in the density of the atmosphere, cloud or charged (ionized) particles, etc., probably would affect the radar returns, and possibly could cause visual returns as well. The appearance (size, shape, movement) and randomness of the radar returns are all characteristic of anomalous returns.

2. The attached photo prints illustrate graphically the radical changes in the scope presentation referenced in paragraph 1 (b). The clock (reflected) is an indication of time interval.

3. Conclusions. It is concluded that the only logical explanation of these sightings is that there were radical variations in the atmosphere during this period which resulted in both visual and radar sightings. It is also concluded that it is beyond the realm of probability that these targets are material targets.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely degraded and low quality. While there is a framed area with some white/light shapes against a dark background, the text is completely illegible. I cannot make out any readable text from this document page.


- page 34 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality and low contrast of the scanned document. There are some faint markings and shapes visible within a framed area, but no clear, readable text can be discerned.

I apologize, but the text on this page is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a black and white document with a framed section in the center, but the text within the frame and elsewhere on the page cannot be clearly read.


- page 36 -

The image appears to be a very low quality, grainy black and white photograph. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor image quality. There is a framed or bordered area in the center of the image with blurry white and gray shapes. At the bottom of the image, there appears to be a faint outline of a figure or object, but the details are too indistinct to make out clearly.
