The visible text on this document is:

24 Jul 61 15 40z

There are some handwritten markings in the top right corner that appear to be "1/3" and "A", but they are not clearly legible.


- page 2 -

The image appears to be a blank or nearly blank white page with some very faint dots or specks. No legible text is visible on this page.


- page 3 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible. I can partially make out "PAGE FOUR ROUTING SG" at the top of the page, but the rest of the text is too faint or blurry to read with confidence.
