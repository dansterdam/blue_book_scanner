MRS. [redacted] PENNA. 18925
November 22, 1966

U.S. Naval Air Station
Willow Grove, Pa.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report seeing what I believe was a UFO. It was last evening, November 21st, a few minutes before 6 P.M. I had just fed my dogs in the house and stepped out in the yard with them. It was dark and the stars were out. I looked at the sky over Doylestown and saw a lighted moving object.

It was flat and circular like the horizontal pictures of the UFO. There was luminescence in the area around the object. It moved quickly across the sky over Doylestown and vanished south taking somewhat the route of 202. No airplanes were in the sky at the time. I'd say the object was about the size of a plane and flying at about the same height. There was just a long second that I could see it. My first reaction was "a lot of people will see that one", as it was so clear.

But I have just called the "Intelligence" and they have had no other reports. My dogs showed no reaction, and I was otherwise alone. I live in the country between Forest Grove
