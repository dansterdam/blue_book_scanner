Dear Sir:

By multiple anticipated in the oral sighting of some unidentifiable flying objects. About 12 midnight and well after those objects later, we noted/logged to date our development of views and observations with the room or similar project personnel. A cross-check of probable or possible earth-to-space phenomena seems regular to earth.

Personal interstellar flight-sightings were at times, with suspicion of the objects to equate the volume of log is one of the local libraries. We sure now feel that the sightings were of a type of flying craft of some kind of celestial or other cosmic verification.

The challenge of the majority of the authors were over-emphasized in view of the existence of these sightings and their intelligent control. But of these evidence of air space over-claims to the U.S. Government in particular, scientific, and other areas...

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Vicinity Biggs AFB, Texas

Date 2 July 1960       Hour (2) 0367

WX Scattered clouds, 20 mi vis, winds SE at 5 to 15 knots

Description Four, size of baseball, had no distinguishable color, four objects in diamond formation, fire trail dark red close to object and white glowin neon in appearance as trail extended behind ufo, when first seen was at about 70 deg, elev remained same during observation. (over)

Direction of Motion Southeast

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Filled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Mass meteor (fireball)

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1)     None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc)  ------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.     Filled out

Other

Evaluation of Source Reliability   Probably reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: The reporting officer stated that he saw several meteors during his night investigation shortly after the reported sightings. It is possible that the witnesses saw a meteor in its first stages of disintegration, although the recorded duration is excessive, probably due to the observer's lack of experience and inability to see it. He saw it and knew what it was so didn't report it. xxxxxxxxxx

Description notes:

Just prior to disappearance the objects appeared to separate, moved in a W to SE flight path, disappeared instantly to its S.E., duration was from 6 to 10 seconds.
