The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blurry, black and white image with indistinct shapes and patterns, likely representing some form of atmospheric or environmental disturbance.

Since the image does not contain a human face, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested:

SOUTH DARMOUTH, MASSACHUSETTS
APRIL 6, 1967

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA
On April 6, 1967, at approximately 1845 hours, the witness, who resides in South Darmouth, Massachusetts, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. 

The witness stated that while outside his residence, he observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving and was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it disappeared.

The witness described the object as being disc-shaped, with a bright white light emanating from the center. He stated that the object appeared to be metallic in nature and was silent in operation.

The witness further stated that he attempted to photograph the object, but was unable to do so due to the speed at which it disappeared from view.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation.
