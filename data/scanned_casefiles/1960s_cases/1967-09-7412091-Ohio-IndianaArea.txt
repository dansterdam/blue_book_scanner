COMMENTS: Sighting #1: Another aircraft apparently sighted object #1. The time of the sighting was given as 0852Z and duration as 10 seconds. Also a ground-visual sighting was made at 0802 in Gary Indiana. They indicated course was NE and duration as 10 seconds. Because the initial observer stated that this object was in view 11 seems likely that it was caused by the decay of some uncatalogued space debris, however, the Smithsonian lists it as a meteor.

Sighting #2: Appears to have been a meteor.

Sighting #3: One of the crew members stated that he thought it may have been a satellite.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In regard to your letter (undated) recently received with reference to a UFO Observation on September 4th, 1967.

I am enclosing a copy of report number #385 which appears to fit the location and time you describe in your letter.

The NORAD file, with regard to report #385 indicated that there was no known TIP (tracking and impact prediction) decay for that location at that time.

The SAO (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) file for this report indicated that this event was a meteor or fireball entry into our atmosphere.

This does not of course, rule out the possibility of a piece of uncatalogued debris re-entering the atmosphere and causing the event that you describe in your letter.

If there is anything further that I can help you with, do not hesitate to write.

Sincerely Yours,
H. E. Roth, Project Director
Volunteer Flight Officer Network

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

21 December 1967

Captain C. C. Davis called and wanted to know if we received his report.

He said that he saw the first object for about 2 minutes. At first it looked like an aircraft with landing lights on, then it started streaming sparks.

Captain Davis compared it to grinding steel on an emory wheel.

He said he saw the second object. It was going up and down. The object moved across and started to stream orange flames. It passed below the horizon and disappeared just before it hit the ground. Ninety seconds later it reappeared, rose up to their altitude and flew parallel with them for approximately twenty minutes.

Captain Davis said that he had seen satellite decays many times before and that he didn't think these were satellite decays. Captain will call back later today.

If we send him a 117 he will give it to [redacted]. He stated that he would like Dr. Menzel's address so he could send him a copy of the sighting.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

21 December 1967

Called SPADATS and talked to Lt. Canitelli.

Object 2934, Cos 176 degree, decayed on the 13th at 2000 Z ± approximately 12 hours, this satellite has a maximum of 72.9° inclination. However, the analysts didn't think the object would break up into two pieces. They did not have a accurate enough records to plot the trajectory to find out if the object passed over Indiana at or near the time of the sightings.

Certain information on the debris is classified. Lt. Canitelli requested that we send a copy of the case to Lt. Lewis when we are through.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

20 Sept. 1967

Called Indianapolis Center (317-244-2495) about aircraft sighting of 14 Sept. 08:02z 0912z; % 0917z.

At the present we have the report of the Saturn 777 but we have no info. on the Universal 689. The controller John B presdorf said that the Capt of the 777 may know the Capt of the 689. He also said that both reported the 08:02 sighting at the same time and gave the same position for the object. Later both reported bright lights off of their right wings. Radar at the Center sporadically painted an object off the right wing of the 689 for about 20 min. However Mr. Presdorf said that it might have been what he called Angels, because it was a sporadic paint. Every once in a while they would see something for only a sweep or two.

Captain Davis, Aircraft Commander, stated the object was a bright white light moving from south to north with trailing sparks. Captain Davis was at 5000 feet estimated the object at 6500 feet. The object disappeared at the 12 o'clock position in relation to the aircraft. The aircraft was on V-50 enroute Indianapolis, Indiana. This would put the object due west of the aircraft when last observed.

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 14 September 1967

TO: Bloomington Police Department
Bloomington, Indiana 47401

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of unidentified flying object reports from the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September 1967 between 3:40 and 4:15.

2. The report consists of two different sightings, at approximately 3:40 am a bright white object, that was trailing sparks and flames, was observed traveling from southwest to northeast. At 4:12 am another object was observed traveling from the southwest to the northeast. This object was also trailing flames, but the flames were orange-green. The objects were observed for approximately two minutes each and were witnessed by several aircraft crew members and one observer in Gary, Indiana.

3. These observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay and for this reason we would like to plot its trajectory. Request information on whether your agency received any similar reports on this night at the above approximate times.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

First officer first saw satellite and in a voice of excitement said, "Look, look!" Later he said he thought it was an aircraft disintegrating as the pieces fell off the main body they glowed white hot then disappeared. The main body continued to glow as it decelerated but with a glow somewhat less intense the pieces that had previously fallen off. It disappeared completely when about 45° to left and 30° high.

Aircraft: 777                                                Crew:

At 8502 sighting over Dayton 10 o'clock our position a bright white light which we thought to be an aircraft with its lights on. At approximately 1.5 feet above us and six miles out at reaching 11 o'clock our position and approximately one mile out sparks and flame was trailing the object at 12 o'clock our position light went out.

At 9122 sighting of white light about 40 miles 2 o'clock our position light appeared about our altitude which was 10.0 traveled about one speed light changed altitude vertically. Straight up and down to 15.0 to 20.0 feet and down to approximately 2.0 feet to 3.0 feet. Crane plane appeared trailing for about 400 to 500 feet and light went out.

A short time later light reappeared and traveled parallel to us at our altitude approximately six miles off to our right for several changing altitudes and disappearing.

14 September 1967    EG-177/1, Fit 2714, PTO-11K
Crew:

I.
After departure from PTO, we proceeded direct to Dayton VOR, climbing to 10,000 feet. Upon passing the station at 0850Z at 5,000 feet, climbing, I called attention to the crew of traffic as 10 o'clock slightly higher than we were. The traffic was northbound in level flight at about 6500 feet (after our station passage, our outbound heading was 264 degrees). Then traffic came to about 11 o'clock, I noticed a trail of white sparks or flame from the tail area, and the lights on the object proper were then observed to be three in number, with the white trail continuing. The lights were white at high intensity. It disappeared at 1220 o'clock position. This information was given to Indianapolis Center and Patterson Tower. Universal 689 was calling the Center at the same time we were regarding the sighting. This was not a conventional aircraft or meteor.

II.
At 0915Z, our altitude 10,000 feet, heading 244 degrees, an object trailing brilliant green and orange flames in a similar was sighted in about a 30 degree downward trajectory and the flames disappeared. This was sighted at our 2 o'clock position, 30 degrees down from horizon, range about 3/4 mile. This was also given to center. The rest of the crew further assessment of the object after the time of disappearance of the colored flame, but my duties on the aircraft prevented any continued observation.

III.
At about 0917Z a bright white light moved in a East to West trade (level-high) from 2 o'clock position to about 4:30 to 5 o'clock position. The object formed the right side of a triangle or first sighting with a star above left, and one below left. This was observed for about 20 minutes, and could have been a satellite.

At 0922 sighting of white light appeared at 2 o'clock our position, estimated at 10 miles out. Light appeared, traveled vertical 15.0 to 20.0, approximately, and down to 2.0 or 3.0 ft. Orange flame broke out behind white light, started a decent toward earth. Orange flame trailing 400 to 500 ft., just before contact with earth's surface flame and light went out. 90 seconds later, white light reappeared and climbed up to our altitude 10.0 ft., and approximately 6 miles off our right wing. Object stayed with us level for 15 minutes at same speed, 230 kts.

UFO Observations

Dr. Charles P. Olivier
American Meteor Society
521 North Wynewood Avenue
Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072

Dear Dr. Olivier:

1. We are in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September 1967 between 3:40 am and 4:15 am. The report consists of two different sightings; at approximately 3:40 am a bright white object, that was trailing sparks and flames, was observed traveling from southwest to northeast. At 4:12 am another object was observed traveling from the southwest to the northeast. This object was also trailing flames, but the flames were orange-green. The objects were observed for approximately two minutes each and were witnessed by several aircraft crew members near Indianapolis and one group of ground observers in Gary, Indiana.

2. The above observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay and/or meteor observations and for this reason we would like to plot its trajectory. Would appreciate any information on whether you received any similar reports for these approximate times.

3. Attached are thirty meteor reports which covers the first nine months of 1967. Hopefully, we will be able to forward the remainder of the reports by the latter part of February. We are in the process of closing out 1967 case files, however, it will take another month or so to finish the task.

4. We hope that the enclosed cases will be helpful in your studies. Should you feel that any of the reports do not fall within the category of meteor, fireball or bolide observations we would appreciate your most authoritative opinion.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR, Major, USAF
