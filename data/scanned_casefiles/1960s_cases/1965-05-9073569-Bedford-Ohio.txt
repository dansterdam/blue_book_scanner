Dear

The President has asked that I reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the skies over the United States is the responsibility of the Air Force. As 16 and other evidence indicates, most reports of unidentified flying objects can be explained either by citizens seeing other aircraft, atmospheric conditions, or celestial activity. However, any evidence such as to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to the nature of these objects will be carefully investigated.

If you desire to be placed on the Air Force mailing list to receive information, please advise.

Sincerely,

This may sound funny but a few boys saw quite a few UFOs
I was one Thursday 5/1965, South. I would think we should
we should do is Find out if they're friendly and if they
are we could make friends with them. If they're not we can
destroy them easy. PS Please send me an answer back.

Sincerely,
