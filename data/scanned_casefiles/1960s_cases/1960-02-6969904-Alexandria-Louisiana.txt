1st. Ind (AFCIN-4D4a)                                     14 April 1960

TO:   AFCIN-452 (Col R.R. Shoop)

1.  It is not quite clear what the originator of the film was referring to in the description of the object as there was nothing in the series of pictures taken outside which fit this description. The portion of the film which was taken inside of what appeared to be a barracks type building was extremely under-exposed and the many small yellow lights are reflections from items such as the luminous bars, the windows and objects on the desk. Throughout this sequence the light bulb in the ceiling mirrored light on the lens of the camera creating many circular red and yellow halations on the film.

2.  It is suggested that the originator be asked to view the film, and indicate which frames he had reference to.
