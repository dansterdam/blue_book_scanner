The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing an outdoor scene. There is a wooden structure or building on the right side of the image. In the foreground, there are two individuals standing in an area with disturbed ground, rocks, and debris. Trees and vegetation can be seen in the background. The scene looks like it could be documenting some kind of investigation or site examination.
