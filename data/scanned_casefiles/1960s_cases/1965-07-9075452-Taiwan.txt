1. DATE - Time Group: 4 July 1965 04/1900Z

2. LOCATION: Taiwan

3. SOURCE: Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Four

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Total 45 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: Varies w/Obj ect

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION:
1. BALLOON 2. AIRCRAFT
Was at 8h 51m. Too close to sun for identification as the stationary object overhead. Finds at altitudes below 50,000 were slight and would not move. Balloon out of area. Likely that the unknown object was a balloon, other a/c possibly a/c since the flight characteristics duration etc are in accord with this analysis.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Four objects observed over a 45 minute period. One object stationary overhead for 45 minutes. At various intervals three other objects were observed for 4 minutes, 10 minutes and 1 minute.

This image appears to be a topographical map of an area in Taiwan, specifically around Taipei-Hsien. The map is in black and white and shows detailed geographical features including terrain, roads, and city/town names. The map is labeled as a U.S. Army Map Service map with a scale of 1:50,000. The bottom portion of the page contains text in Chinese characters, which appears to be map metadata and information about the map's creation or specifications. The map covers grid sections numbered from 36 to 46, with various geographical features and locations marked.

UFO Sightings, 4 Jul and 12 Jul 1965

607th Security Group
AFO San Francisco, Calif. 96350

1. The objects observed by personnel on the night of 4 July 1965 have been evaluated by unique personnel at FTD personnel sightings aircraft sightings (objects 1, 3 and 4). Object number 2 is believed to be a balloon.

2. Objects observed on the night of 12 July 1965 are regarded as earth orbiting satellites, which can be attributed to an optical illusion, an the smallest of glances. In addition, atmospheric conditions such as inversions frequently aid to this illusion. Other possible explanations include satellites or planets visible to the naked eye. There are 28 planets which could have been mistaken for satellites by inexperienced observers. Specific identification was not attempted other than a check of the radio 1 and 2 channels. These objects were not visible in your area at the times which you reported.

19 AUG 1965

1. The objects observed by personnel on the night of 4 Jul 1965 have been evaluated by analyst personnel at FTD as possible aircraft sightings (objects 1, 3 and 4). Object number 2 is believed to be a balloon.

2. Objects observed on the night of 12 July 1965 are regarded as earth orbiting satellites. Motion of circumsolar inclusions can be attributed to an optical illusion as the satellite appears to pass near stars or planets. In addition, atmospheric conditions such as inversion frequently add to this illusion. There are more than thirty satellite payloads and satellite components in orbit visible to the naked eye. Analysis of these were of the first magnitude or brighter. Specific identification was not attempted other than a check of the Bohr I and II and Pegasus I and II schedules. These objects were not visible in your area at the times which you reported.

This image is a topographical map of Taiwan at a scale of 1:50,000. The document contains a detailed legend on the left side explaining various map symbols for roads, railroads, boundaries, and points of interest. The map itself shows a grid with latitude and longitude coordinates, and includes various geographical features, towns, and infrastructure. The map is primarily in black and white, with text in both English and what appears to be Chinese characters. There are handwritten markings on the map, including "0340 lb" and "OBJ. #3" near the top right of the document.

The legend provides symbols and descriptions for:
- Road types (all weather, hard surface, loose surface)
- Railroad types (normal gauge, narrow gauge)
- Boundaries (international, provincial, district)
- Various infrastructure and geographical features
- Points of interest (schools, hospitals, factories, etc.)

The map covers a portion of Taiwan, showing various geographical details and grid references.
