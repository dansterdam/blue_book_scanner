11. COMMENTS
No mention of the speed of the object was given or the length of the pause between changing directions. Also it is difficult to understand how this much detail about the object could be given in a sight log of such short duration. Observed from moving car through windshield at an elevation of 60-70 degrees. The witness in this report cannot give the color, note the stopping and follow the object with sufficient ease to give this report.

FOR THIS REASON, AZIMUTH OF FIRST CLEARANCE AND THE OF DISAPPEARANCE GIVEN AS APPROXIMATE.

SEVERAL SOURCES TRAVELING SOME 30 CITY STREETS AND ALTHOUGH NOTHING YET MADE OF OBSERVATION, ESTIMATE AZIMUTH OF OBJECT CLEARANCE SEEMED TO BE NOT PRECISE. THEN FROM IT COURSE AND SPEED AT GIVEN POINT OF ELEVATION... CLEARANCE DESCRIBED OBJECT AS FIRST TRAVELING TO THE EAST, WRITING, WHILE...
