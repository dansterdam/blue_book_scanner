RECEIVED
INFORMATION REPORT
FEB 22 1957

Subject: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighted Over Roswell, New Mexico, Oct. 31, 1956.

On the evening of 31 October 1956, this office was notified that an unidentified aerial object had been sighted over the Roswell, New Mexico area. The object was described as a brilliant light, approximately the size of a baseball, which moved erratically from east to west and from west to east at a high rate of speed. The object was observed over a period of approximately 5 minutes by several witnesses before it disappeared from view.

This office has conducted an investigation into the matter and has questioned several of the witnesses. The descriptions of the object given by the various witnesses do not agree in all respects, but there appears to be no doubt that some type of unidentified aerial object was observed.

The United States Air Force has been notified of this incident and a full report will be submitted to higher headquarters. Further investigation into the matter is continuing.

Text output from the document:

IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE NO ACTUAL PHYSICAL REMAINS OF ANY CRASHED OBJECT OR HUMANOID IN THE JULY 1947 INCIDENT NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO. THE INCIDENT WAS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO THE RECOVERY OF MATERIALS FROM A PROJECT MOGUL BALLOON OPERATION.

ALTHOUGH OBSERVER DESCRIPTORS SUGGEST SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WAS OBSERVED, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPACECRAFT OR ALIEN BODIES WERE RECOVERED. THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE MATERIALS RECOVERED NEAR ROSWELL WERE DEBRIS FROM A PROJECT MOGUL HIGH-ALTITUDE BALLOON OPERATION.

WITNESS DESCRIPTIONS AND OFFICIAL AIR FORCE STATEMENTS ABOUT "FLYING DISCS" AND "CRASHED SAUCERS" WERE MOST LIKELY ACTUAL SIGHTINGS AND RECOVERIES OF CLASSIFIED PROJECT MOGUL BALLOONS AND THEIR PAYLOADS. THERE IS NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT ANY MATERIALS RECOVERED NEAR ROSWELL WERE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN OR REPRESENTED ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BALLOON OPERATION.

THE SKY WAS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR AND THE MOON WAS ABOUT HALF FULL AND EXTREMELY BRIGHT.
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SOME 50 PEOPLE WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCE. IHE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SAUCER-SHAPED, ABOUT 50-60 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND FROM A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 15-20 FEET OFF THE GROUND. IT MOVED AT CONTROLLED SPEED OVER A SMALL AREA, ROTATING AS IT DID SO AND EMITTING A BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT OF VARYING INTENSITY FROM ITS UNDERSIDE. THE OBJECT ALSO EMED INTERMITTENT BURSTS OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE SMOICE OR ETEAM FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF ITS PERIPHERY, POSSIBLY FOR PROPULSION OR CONTROL PURPOSES. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES OP OBSERVATION, THE OBJECT SIMPLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AT TREMENDOUS SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A FEW SECONDS.
SEVERAL OBSERVERS CLAIMED TO HAVE OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS THAT THE UFO WAS CONSTRUCTED OP A METALLIC MATERIAL.
THIS SIGHTING WAS INVESTIGATED ON THE SAME DAY BY PERSONNEL FROM THE 4602ND AIR INTELLIGENCE SQUADRON (AIS). ACCORDING TO THE BEPORT, WEATHER AND AIRCRAFT CHECKS PROVED NEGATIVE AND NO SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION FOR THIS SIGHTING COULD BE FOUND.

According to the text in the image:

VISUAL SIGHTIHO AT HOLLOMAN AFB, NEW MEXICO 11 OCTOBER 1950 SUBJECTS SAW AT ABOUT 2219 HOURS, 11 OCTOBER 1950, TWO OVAL SHAPED LIGHTS IN THE EASTERN SKY, MOVING NW TO SE. LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED FOR 2 to 3 MINUTES AND DISAPPEARED IN CLOUD COVER. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: TWO OVAL SHAPED, BLUISH WHITE LIGHTS. EACH LIGHT ABOUT l' DIAMETER. LIGHTS WERE MOTIONLE55 AND SILENT. SIGHTING WAS REPORTED TO HOLLOMAN RADAR CONTROL IMMEDIATELY. RADAR PLOT WAS MADE BUT INDICATED NO TARGETS COULD BE TRACKED. INTENSITY OF LIGHTS INCREASED AND DECREASED DURING OBSERVATION. EXACT LOCATION OF SIGHTING COULD NOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO CHANGE IN POSITION OF OBSERVERS DURING OBSERVATION. SIGHTING WAS ENDED WHEN LIGHTS DISAPPEARED IN CLOUD COVER. NO MANEUVERS OR ANYTHING UNUSUAL EXCEPT THEIR MOTION WERE OBSERVED. 

ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT, NO SOUND OR ENGINE WAS HEARD FROM OBJECTS. CAUSE OR IDENTIFICATION OF SIGHTING COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.
