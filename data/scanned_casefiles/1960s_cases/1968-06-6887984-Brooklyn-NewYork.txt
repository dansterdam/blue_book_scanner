UFO Sightings of Aug 1967 and 3 Jun 1968

Brooklyn, New York 11215

Reference your UFO sightings of Aug 1967 and 3 Jun 1968. Although we consider these sightings too old to investigate properly, we did submit your photographs to our photographic experts. Their findings are as follows:

"There is a definite pattern of light imagery on both prints. There are at least five of these images in addition to the particular one on each print identified by the sender as a UFO. An overlay was constructed for print Nr. 1 with tick marks over each image including that identified as a UFO. When this overlay was applied to print Nr. 2, the tick marks correspond perfectly to the images present. Due to the fact that there is a definite pattern of like images although the field of view differs considerably, it is most likely that there was a pattern or foreign material present on the negative holder of the printing device.

SUBJECT: UFO - MANHATTAN ISLAND

ANALYST:                                   PI: Chapin                   DATE: 16 May 69

1. The following comments pertain to imagery described by [redacted], Jr., Brooklyn, N.Y., on two black and white prints forwarded to PTD for analysis.

2. There is a definite pattern of light imagery on both prints. There are at least five of these images in addition to the particular one on each print identified by the sender as a U.F.O. An overlay was constructed for print Nr. 1 with tick marks over each image identified that, identified as a UFO. When this overlay was applied to print Nr. 2, the tick marks correspond perfectly to the images present. Due to the fact that there is a definite pattern of like images albeit somewhat considerably, it is most likely that there was a pattern of foreign material present on the negative holder of the printing device. The grid overlay is being forwarded with the returned prints to PTD/UFO.

Dear Gentlemen,

I'm writing you this letter to tell you what my friend and I saw...

It was on June 8th 1968 when my friend and I saw a flying Saucer, (U.F.O.). It was a round object with different colors. It looked like this, sample.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT??

We saw another one in August of 1967, when my friend, his mother and I went to a Ferry Boat Ride, around Manhattan Island. I have two pictures of it.
