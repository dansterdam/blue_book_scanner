10. CONCLUSION
Astro(Sirius) - pass.  jrot
& time of the sighting Sirius was on an AZ of 115 deg
end at an elevation of 14 deg

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a bright fluorescent, pulsating light
in the southeastern part of the sky. Movement of the
object was not perceptible without the use of a telescope.
The object was overhead when last viewed which was about
four hours after the initial observation. Colors noted
were blue, white, and red.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical
observation. Approximately four hours after the initial observation Sirius would have been almost overhead. Sirius
was rising in the SE just prior to the initial sighting.

COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATOR

Mrs. [redacted] stated she first noticed the object in the sky while stopped in her automobile at the stop sign on Mott Avenue and Edgewater Drive while she was enroute home at approximately 1915 hours. She observed the object remaining apparently stationary as she proceeded to her home. Upon arriving home, her son and her neighbor, Mrs. [redacted] were called to observe the object.

The two boys set up a "toy" telescope in the open field adjacent to the residence near the "Pump House". The movement of the object as observed by Mrs. [redacted] was extremely slow, with the movement in a north westerly direction being barely perceptible. The boys stated that through the telescope they could see the colors and erratic movement, up and down and from side to side. All of the observers stated that objects had been sighted before but did not feel they were worthwhile reporting. No one would venture a guess as to what the object might be, but did state they had heard a lot about UFO's. Mr. [redacted] was not home at the time of the interview, but the time during the time of the sighting but was not interested in going out to look. Mr. [redacted] was present at the time of the interview but said that he did not look either.

SUMMARY: I checked the area in the vicinity of the [redacted] home and approximately the same route Mrs. [redacted] covered on her way home. Visibility generally was good with only a few trees obscuring the view in the direction the reported object was seen. I do not believe the observers are publicity seekers or unduly concerned with "Flying Saucers". I believe them to be of average intelligence and are convinced the object was there. The only opinion I might offer is that the object could have been similar to a weather balloon at a very high altitude drifting slowly northwest.
