The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photographic image. The sketch includes a curved line representing the horizon, and another curved line representing the path or direction of an object or objects. There is also a compass rose or directional indicator in the top right corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show only changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is handwritten and discusses information that the person completing the questionnaire feels is pertinent but not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
  Day  Month  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the
questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object seen was bright and oval in shape. It seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet in the air and was
moving at a reasonably fast speed, estimated at around 500 mph. It was observed by at least 3 other
people besides myself. At first it appeared as a small bright light, then as it approached it became larger
and more distinct in outline. The light was a bright steady glow, not flashing or blinking. The object seemed
to float easily through the air and was followed by a short trail of what appeared to be a pale bluish-white
vapor or exhaust. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it disappeared from
sight toward the southeast behind some trees. It was a clear night and the moon was about 1/2 full. No
other objects were visible in the sky at the time. I have no idea what the object was and it was unlike
anything I have ever seen before. It did not seem to be an airplane, satellite, or any other known aircraft.
The size, speed, and motion of the object were unlike anything familiar to me.
