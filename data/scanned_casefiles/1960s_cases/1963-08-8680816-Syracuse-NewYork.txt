Here is the OCR text from the document:

Dr. Special Zuckett,

Last August while visiting Syracuse, New York, I was watching an airplane when my eyes caught sight of three strange blinking U.F.O.'s that were traveling in a path that crossed over the planes path.

After my whole family (6 of us) watched them go out of sight we immediately called up the Air Defense Command Headquarters to report the whole incident. Others had reported them that day also.

For about 2 years I have been very interested in U.F.O. sightings. I have read all the books in the library that I could get my hands on. I also have collected a number of photographs of U.F.O.'s from magazines, friends etc... Being a curious 5th grader, I am in search of additional information on this subject. If you have any information on this subject that you could send me I would sincerely appreciate it.

Sincerely,
[Redacted name]
West, Des Moines, Iowa
