10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Time of day/night not included. If sighting made during night and witness estimation of size is consistent with a close object that pattern of report suggests BIRDS as the probably cause. Since the report is over 2 years old, it is not feasible to conduct an inquiry.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS (Case regarded as INSUFFICIENT DATA)
Reported in 1965. Sighting consisted of four lights coming out of the North in straight flight to the South. Initially they had pattern of two in front and two behind. Shifted position until one went right and three went to the left in a specific pattern. Objects returned to their original position and flew out of sight. White lights, round and fairly large. Passed over a water tower but considerable distance above it. Thought to be in August.

Dear Sirs:

In the summer of 1963 my friend and I, were sitting in front of my house, when we saw four lights pass by. The lights came out of the north and went straight south. When we first saw them, they were in a pattern. Two in front and next to each other, the next two diagonally in back of them and next to each other. Then they shifted positions so that one light went to the right and the other three moved to the left. The three on the left were in no specific position. They then came back in the original position and flew out of sight. We saw them for only about ten seconds. The lights were white, round, and fairly large. They appeared not to high in the sky. But they passed directly over the Central View tower and they were a considerable distance above it.

The sighting occurred, I believe, in August. The reason I missed so long to report it is that everyone we told said it was nothing of importance. I'd not been for these close pictures from the August 8, 1965 Navy. I would not have written the lights shown in the picture are the same as the ones I sighted. I live at Plainview, Long Island, New York.

Very truly yours,

Dear Mr.

Due to the time lapse involved in reporting your aerial observations to the Air Force, it is not possible for us to evaluate them.

During 10 years of investigating UFO reports, we have come to the conclusion that such observations are merely a misinterpretation of known natural or conventional objects.

The attached report on Project Blue Book will provide you with more information on this subject.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
