Dear Sir:

On the night of March third at 7:30 P.M. a group of us, high school students were on our way to Oswego Catholic High School after a Glee Club rehearsal. About two blocks away from school, one of our friends spotted an object in the air, moving very slowly.

It is believed that we had never seen anything like it before. It was white on the bottom with two red flashing lights, which seemed to be on the top. It was circular in shape, about the size of a plane, but much lower. One of the girls practiced that its hard stopped and began to hover. It was traveling in the same direction that we were, partly, but when we turned southeast it turned with us and disappeared over the roof of Little High, as we were entering the school. One

after give thought the seardia bounds, but
wasn't sure, not one else heard the
sound. We notified the police the same
night and they could give not explanation
of what we saw. The next day looking
through Look Magazine we came
across an article on unidile field
flying objects. After reading the article,
we brought it to the Chief of Police, and
he agreed that it sounded shortly after
what we saw. This was at 2 o'clock 22
miles of Lake.

If there is anything else, you would
be kind you may contact us. We will
include the names, address, and
phone numbers of the other three girls.

Sincerely yours,
