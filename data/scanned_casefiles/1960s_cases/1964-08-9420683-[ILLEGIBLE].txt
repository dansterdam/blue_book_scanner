DEARBORN OBSERVATORY

EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 6021
23 February 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla
Foreign Technology Division
Box 9494
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing a toasted copy of a APRO bulletin. Please notice the reported Holloman Air Force Base case. This is the sort of case which prompts charges of Air Force secrecy, and I feel that it would be very wise to track this one down to its lair if at all possible. Apparently there was some conversation between the bomber pilot and the tower with radio amateur accidentally overheard, but things like that can't get wiped in the bud at the very beginning. It gives an awful lot of grist for the mill of APRO, etc. I don't know what can be done at this late date, but at the very least, the radio amateur and the newspaper reporter should be contacted to see just what the original stimulus was.

I am also enclosing a toasted copy of a note from Mr. English. He was the one who reported the Toledo case which was rather similar to the Monticello case. I have asked him to get some pictures made of the terrain around there at a nominal cost if necessary.

Reference 18 August 1954, 200 miles east of Dover (Atlantic): would it be possible to get the names of the crew members concerned? I would like to write to them and have each one give me a completely independent statement and drawing of what they reported. Say, "If this can be done, we may be able to take one of the unidentified list. Apparently these people were between two cloud decks and saw an object approaching them. I might have been a relatively stationary balloon which they were overtaking and passed. Since everything over the Atlantic is carefully checked by radar, this is a puzzler, and it would be very interesting to get the comments of the individual crew members. I would like to find out how bright the object appeared and also whether they ever saw it to the rear of the plane.

Last Sunday I took occasion while loafing around to call this German professor at the Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg, Virginia. This is the case, you will remember, that Dave and Sgt. Jones investigated. I also called Horace Burns because I wanted to get straight on two points. One was how they would explain the fact that no one else on a well traveled road would not have seen the object and also by talking to get a possible line on their personality quirks.

Gamen gave Burns a completely clean bill of health which, of course, I expected. Gamen seems to be a little displeased with the counter Dave was using and asked me why Dave kept setting it back to zero whenever it scored a large reading. He also wanted to know how, when the ground was covered with four inches of snow, Dave could say categorically, that there were no traces of anything having landed.

Dear [REDACTED]

This is in reply to your letter of August 20, 1964, in which you both gave a very interesting narrative of some observations of unusual aerial objects.

We are interested in finding out from you both just how these sightings have differed from other sightings you previously observed. It would be appreciated if you would write us, giving your observations on this matter, and we will in turn attempt an evaluation of your sightings from the additional information. Attached is a self-addressed envelope for your convenience.

August 20, 1964

Commanding General
Kirtland Air Force Base
Albuquerque, New Mexico

Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects"

Dear Sir:

It has recently come to our attention that you may be interested in observations of unusual objects in the sky. We have been interested in astronomical observations for the past several years and have made such observations of various kinds astronomical phenomena. We have been using a 4½ inch reflecting telescope for many of our observations. We are in the ninth grade in school.

During the past month we have been observing the Perseid meteor shower and spotting satellites.

At 1:25 AM on August 12 one of us spotted a very strange sight. This appeared to be two bright lights which suddenly a moved about 30-40 degrees above the horizon in the southeast direction and increased about 24 seconds later near the northeast direction. They were almost rigid in color. As they moved they changed color from white to a yellowish green to a sharp accuracy pointing. This sound started over the lights first appeared and it was a low humming sound which accompanied this object.

At 1:00 PM on the same morning we both saw another bright light which first appeared to be a star and then increased in size and moved into a cloud near (Star). We heard no sound.

On August 16 during a clear night we saw a strange object near the northern horizon which moved very quickly across the sky within about one second, with no sound.

We have a few other observations which we would like to discuss. These observers, signers or any of us will gladly make these observations available to you. We would be glad to try to answer any further questions which you may have about these objects.

Sincerely,

[Signature block redacted]

Dear [redacted]

This is in response to your recent letter to the President concerning information on several recent satellite observations. The President has asked that I reply to your inquiry.

You indicated a date of July 3, 1963, as the time of your first sighting. I regret that the Air Force does not maintain records of satellite passages for more than one year. However, it may be that you observed a satellite launched several days prior to that date or perhaps a high-flying aircraft.

For your information, both Echo I and Echo II made several passages over your area on the evenings of August 3rd, August 4th, and August 5th, 1964, between 7:15 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.

Because of atmospheric conditions, a satellite may give the appearance of blinking or flashing as it passes warped in such a way that may not be typical.

Your interest in this matter is understood.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]

This is in response to your recent letter to the President concerning information on several recent satellite observations. The President has asked that I reply to your letter.

You indicated a date of July 3, 1963, as the time of your first sighting. The Air Force does not maintain records of satellite passage for more than one year. However, our records for July 3, 1964 do not indicate a passage of either Echo I or Echo II for that date in your area, and if you meant 1964 instead of 1963, it may be that you observed a satellite of lesser magnitude or perhaps a high-flying aircraft on that date. Since you did not indicate the length of time of the observation, we are unable to make a firm determination of the origin of the light.

Both Echo I and Echo II made several passes over your area on the succeeding evenings of August 3rd, August 4th and August 17th, between 7:54 p.m. and 10:45 p.m.

Because of atmospheric conditions, a satellite may give the appearance of blinking or flashing as it passes overhead in much the same way that a star may twinkle.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Dear Senator Keating:

This is in response to your inquiry in behalf of Doctor [REDACTED] concerning unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

There is no truth to allegations that the Air Force withholds or otherwise censors information vital to public understanding or evaluation of the nature of UFOs. In some instances the names of individuals are withheld to protect them from the curious. It is sometimes necessary to withhold information concerning investigative procedures which are also used in the evaluation of other intelligence information to prevent compromise.

The Air Force does not have the resources allocated to the project to fill the numerous requests from individuals and organizations for copies of individual investigative reports. However, we do accept requests from base, ride news media representatives to review the UFO files, and several such representatives have done so. In addition, he has issued periodically, through the Department of Defense, summaries of the Air Force's findings in its continuing UFO investigations. Periodic fact sheets are available to news media and any other interested individuals. The latest fact sheet is enclosed to further clarify the Air Force position.

The United States Air Force will continue to investigate all reported cases of unusual aerial phenomena. Over the United States, services of qualified scientists and technicians will continue to be utilized to investigate and analyze these reports, and periodic public statements on the subject will be made as warranted.

Your interest in Air Force activities is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Maj. Hart

August 31, 1964

Dear Sir:

This is in response to your letter of August 19, 1964, addressed to NASA, in which you requested information on satellite passage over your area during recent evenings.

You were witnessing the passage of both Echo I and Echo III which passed over the New Jersey-New York area during the evening hours mentioned in your letter. Sometimes one of these will make two passes during the evening, approximately 2 hours apart, and at other times you may first observe the passage of one and then the other.

It is believed that the Echo schedules are printed in the New York Times newspaper, and you should be able to ascertain from these schedules just which satellite will be overhead at a certain time.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

August 19, 1964

Dear Gentlemen!:

For approximately the last three weeks on clear nights I have been seeing an odd object in the sky. Others have seen it also. I was wondering if you could tell me what it is. It looks like a star — except it moves! It is - slow - has a zig-zag movement in addition to - straight movement.

I live in Frankin, New Jersey and first - got it in the southern sky, going toward the northern sky. We saw it until it disappeared from our eye-sight.

The time we saw our friend was a half in between 7:30 P.M. and 10 P.M. - or hour. We saw it for approximately ten minutes each time soon the time we first spot it to the time it disappears from sight. Some nights we saw it once and some nights we saw it as many as two or three times.

The third day we noticed it we saw it from this view!


- page 38 -

I would appreciate it very much if you could tell me what it is.
Thank you for your time.

Sincerely yours,

I... I heard about your watchdog satellites.
I was thinking maybe that's what it
is. (I hope you are still me what it
is !)

My Address:

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:   BC                                                27 August 1964

SUBJECT:   Report of Unidentified Object Activity

TO:        AFSC(FTD)
            Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 45433

1. On 21 August 1964 at 1500 hours local time, a call was received at this installation from the police department of Moses Lake, Washington, informing the Air Police of the discovery of what appeared to be the landing site of an Unidentified Flying Object. Lt Colonel Earl E. Ellis, the Wing Intelligence Officer, was designated by the undersigned to initiate an immediate investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2.

2. A check with the Seattle Air Defense Sector, local Control Towers, Larson AFB Com, and local Weather Stations revealed that there was no reported or scheduled activity in the area at the time of the alleged UFO activity.

3. In an interview with Mrs. [REDACTED], of [REDACTED], Moses Lake, Washington, the following information was obtained:

a. At 0156, 21 August 1964, Mrs. [REDACTED] was awakened by what sounded like an alarm clock ringing. She had set her alarm for 0500 to get her two sons, ages 11 and 14 off to work. She then noticed that it was three hours before they were to be awakened for their daily chores. She reasoned that the electricity in her home had been off for three hours sometime during the night. She then checked two other clocks of the wind-up type; they showed it to be 0200 in the morning. She returned to bed and was immediately awakened by the sounds of two horses and two dogs on the premises. Her own words were, "They were causing a terrible commotion". She then went back to sleep. At approximately 1030 hours that same morning, her sons and several of their friends were playing in the field adjacent to the house when they found what appeared to be the landing site of a vehicle with a "tripod" type landing gear. These tripod marks were approximately eighteen inches in diameter, and six to eight inches deep. In the center of these depressions was a crater approximately four and one half feet in diameter and eight to ten inches deep. A diagram of this alleged landing spot is included in this report.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

4. Coming from the north western "tripod" depression were what appeared to be footprints. There were forty-three of these prints heading in a westerly direction, one, in what appeared to be a turn to the right, and twenty-two footprints heading back to the north west "tripod" impression. Some of the returning footprints had been obliterated by the children playing in the pasture. The footprints were twenty-two inches long and eight inches wide, and approximately two inches deep.

5. Radiation tests and photographs were taken of the area and are included in this report.

6. At 1800 on 21 August 1964, an extensive search of the area was completed by the investigating officer. With the exception of the impressions noted in this report, no further evidence of unusual activity was discovered. Due to the presence of numerous sightseers and the antics of the two horses pastured in the area, the impressions were somewhat disturbed by the time the investigating officer arrived on the scene.

7. The exact location of the reported activity is 47 07N, 119 16. 5W. This places the area in question within walking distance of the shoreline of Moses Lake.

8. Results of this investigation would indicate that persons unknown are perpetrating a hoax. This conclusion is based on the fact that any of the depressions in the area can readily be duplicated by someone wearing a size ten "tripod" effect can be obtained by standing on the ball of the shoe and rotating in a manner that would cause the heel of the shoe to dig into the soft soil. The "footprints" depressions can be duplicated by moving the shoe in a back and forth motion. The "Crater" depression can be duplicated by rotating a two foot piece of wood. All of these methods were demonstrated on the scene and identical depressions were achieved. The "alarm clock ringing" sound heard by Mrs. [REDACTED] can readily be explained as coming from the numerous motorbats that travel the lake at all hours of the day and night.

9. Based on the investigation conducted, it is the opinion of this headquarters that nothing of significance to the Air Force or to the security of the United States was involved in the activity reported to this installation on 21 August 1964.

3. Lynn, Massachusetts, 10:30pm EDT, 25 August 1964 - No mention is made as to whether the object descended between the observer and the hill or disappeared behind the hill. The statement that the object "hovered momentarily seemingly about four feet above the hill top and then apparently landed out of sight being hid by shrubbery" implies that the object was observed between the witnesses and the hill. The remaining information indicates that the object was found on crest of the hill.

a. Supporting Evidence - The nurse's remembrance of a sound may or may not be associated with the observation of Richard J Pratt. Information of this nature cannot be considered as valid since no association can be established.

b. Special Evidence of Interest - Such statements as electrical power stations attracting a UFO indicates a definite bias in the investigation. In more than the 6000 cases the Air Force has evidence which proves or tends to prove that extraterrestrial intelligence has visited the earth. The majority of cases are misinterpretation of natural phenomena or objects.

4. In conclusion, we repeat, no information presented indicates that both sightings could not have been caused by an aircraft.

1. We are in receipt of two unidentified flying object reports
from Raymond E Fowler, NICAP Member, of 13 Friend Court, Wanham,
Massachusetts. Information presented by Mr Fowler, while not
requesting a reply has in the past resulted in inquiries as to
our evaluations.

2. Littleton, Massachusetts, 9:50pm EDT, 25 August 1964 - No
information was received in the sighting of an unidentified object
and have been caused by an aircraft.

a. Regarding the sighting of [illegible] - The
duration was not included and the time motion sequence of the
object could not be made available. We realize that such statements
are lacking and have no value unless the duration is included. In
many cases an aircraft can appear to hover as it approaches,
turns or moves away from an observer while in reality the speed
may be as great as 400-500 mph. In addition, no basis was given
for estimation of the size.

b. Regarding the sighting of [illegible] - The time of
the sighting and duration are omitted. Without this information
no association with the sighting of the object can be made other
than the description of the object being similar. Such
statements as high speed have little scientific value. Speeds
should be reported in arc distance traveled by the object. Again,
the duration of one minute does not include that portion which
the witnesses believe the object to be hovering. Also, no basis
for the estimation of 200 feet is given.

c. The Air Force regards all witnesses as creditable and
makes no differentiation as to the age of the witness. No astro-
medical aspects are apparently in these sightings.

Dear Capt. Quintanilla:

I am hoping you can furnish me with information on some sightings my family and I have made in recent weeks.

The objects we have seen appear to be stars, but upon close observation we note that they are moving, and in the space of five or ten minutes they disappear in the distance.

It is impossible to estimate the altitude at which they navigate because we have no idea of their size. As I say, they appear to be stars, but I've never known stars to move, and if, indeed, these objects were at that distance, they would be huge bodies, and moving at tremendous speed.

LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS UFO SIGHTING - AUGUST 25, 1964.

BACKGROUND:

On Saturday, August 29th, upon the return home from interviewing the witnesses of the Littleton sightings, I found news of another UFO report waiting for me. My brother had heard a rumor at the factory which he works about someone who had recently seen a "Flying Saucer". He traced it back to a friend of the witness who verified the witness's name because he did not want to be ridiculed. After much persuasion we managed to get the witness's first name and his telephone number. When I phoned him he was very reluctant to talk about his experience saying he was afraid he had never seen it and that he just wanted to forget about it. One could tell by his voice that he had been badly frightened. Again, after much persuasion, I arranged a meeting with his friend for a POC. He still would not give me his full name and address. (I tried without success to obtain it through the telephone company and had already started going through all the numbers in the Lynn telephone directory to identify him - but, this proved unnecessary)

On the evening of August 31st I interviewed the witness. After I showed him other UFO Reports he finally relented and filled out a UFO Data Sheet allowing his use of name. His sighting account is as follows:

WITNESS:
[Redacted name]
Lynn, Massachusetts
Age: 17

[Redacted name] had just gotten out of his car at 10:30 PM EDT and was about to enter his house when he heard a strange high-pitched whistle or whining sound coming from the top of Lennox Hill in back of his house. (See Map & Diagram). He looked up on the hill and stood petrified with fear as he watched a silver oval-shaped object about the size of a regular automobile slowly descending onto the hill top with what was about 300 yards away from him. It had a rim of soft white light around its perimeter and a dome-like protrusion in the center of the object was clearly seen. It hovered momentarily seemingly about 15 feet above the hill, then apparently landed out of sight being hid by shrubbery.

Copied from [Redacted] sketch on UFO Data Sheet

[Redacted name] said that he was frightened and upset at what he had seen and went immediately into the house telling no one. He asked him why he did not go up on the hill to investigate. He said he was scared. Told no one about what he had seen for fear of ridicule but after awhile felt he just had to tell somebody so confident in his friend who later informed my brother.


- page 114 -

They went up on the hill later that week to investigate but found nothing.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
I checked various establishments located around the perimeter of Lenox hill for more witnesses. Lynn Hospital is located on the opposite side of the hill. I found a home and is about 1000 feet from the estimated landing or near-landing site of the UFO. After questioning a number of nurses I finally found one that was on duty that particular night. Although she could not remember the exact time, she said that after 9:00, she remembered distinctly hearing a "high-pitched whistling sound" that was so strange that she went out to a statement to this effect and signed it. A Xerox copy is enclosed. She did not investigate the sound because she was just a new type Fire while.

Another nurse remembered seeing two boys on top of the hill searching the area for something. This was most likely and had looked for possible signs left by the UFO.

SPECIAL ITEMS OF INTEREST:
1. The presence of an "Electrical Power Station" built up against the hill which may have attracted the UFO.

2. The sighting of a similar UFO in that general area of Lynn on June 15, 1964 as reported by Walter Webb. I showed a sketch, excerpts of this UFO after our interview and he said it looked almost identical to what he had seen except he had seen it light on the bottom. (He could have missed it because the UFO was tilted toward him when he observed it.)

CHARACTER OF WITNESS:
1. I got the immediate impression when I talked to him on the phone and when we talked face-to-face that Richard was telling the truth as he knew it. You could see him re-living the experience in his eyes as he related what took place.

2. My brother works with [REDACTED] friend who has given an above-reproach character reference.

AREA UFO CHECKPOINTS:
Hanscom AFB, Bedford, Mass. - Negative regarding UFO Reports
Smithsonian Astrophysical Institute - Satellite: 8:53 PM
                                     - Satellite: 10:54 PM
                                     - Monmouth - No UFO Reported

Sky Lite Advertising Plane - 
I checked with the manager whom I have called quite a few times before and who is very cooperative. SEE ATTACHED MAP WITH HIS FLIGHT PATH FOR THE NIGHT IN QUESTION.


- page 115 -

During the past few months I have received three different
UFO Reports which turned out to be this advertising plane. In
all cases, sketches of the "UFO") were of a string of very
bright white lights. I have compared these sketches with the
sketch of the plane and have found little resemblance.

If the times given me by "Sky Lite" and the times are
even approximate the aircraft in this case would be
ruled out. When the plane shut its lights out it was not yet
in the area of this section of Lynn and it was N.E. of Lenox
Hill. At 10:15 the plane was on a due North bearing above and
to the East of Lenox Hill. The manager said that one would
have had to look due north to see him from then on.

If the times and flight path given me are incorrect then the
advertising plane remains a "possibility" but to be such it
would have had to have been a "lights on flying high and
due west from Lenox Hill". Lenox Hill rises almost directly
in back of the home and all along that part of Western
Avenue. Very little of the Western sky can be seen.

Richard watched the UFO hover for about three minutes and
he was looking due West. He was about 300 yards from it and
heard a distant sound coming from it. The configuration
shown in his sketch was clearly seen.

CONCLUSION:

After examining the witness and checking out the approximate
landing or near-landing site personally, I do not think
mostly rock outcrop. I found no signs such as scorched areas
or identifications. It was dusk for I searched this area. I hope
to go back in the daytime for a better look. I am convinced
that this sighting was of a genuine UFO.

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS

LITTLETON, MASSACHUSETTS UFO SIGHTING - AUGUST 25, 1964

BACKGROUND:

On Friday, August 28th at Sylvania, Waltham, Mass. I received a telephone call from a Research Engineer working at the Applied Research Laboratory. He had heard of my interest in UFO's and called to tell me of several UFO sightings in the Littleton area. There were several recent sightings so I arranged an interview with as many of the witnesses as possible. I arrived at his home on the following afternoon, Saturday, August 29th, and interviewed witnesses between 1:00 and 3:15 PM. The following are accounts pertaining to the most recent Littleton sighting.

WITNESS # 1
[Redacted]
Littleton, Massachusetts
Age: 12

[Redacted] was thumbing a ride home and was picked up at Littleton Common by two older boys. It was then that the older boys started a strange object carrying lights flying low over the Common and gave chase in the car. After losing sight of it several times the chase ended outside of town at "Porter Field".

They got out of the car and observed the object as it hovered with a "fluttering motion" over the field about 500 - 1000 feet away. When they started to walk across the field toward the object, its lights went out and it sped away disappearing over the trees.

The following is a summarized description of the object as given me by [Redacted]. The UFO was "silver-gray", appeared solid and was estimated to be 75-125 feet in length. It was an oval shape with a "rim" around the bottom. It carried three pulsating lights similar in intensity to that of automobile taillights a block away. There was a red light on each end and a white one on top in the middle. It made a soft "roaring sound" similar to that of a jet plane but not as loud.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and partially difficult to read, but appears to be a detailed narrative description of some kind of sighting or observation. Some words are clear, but many are difficult to fully transcribe with complete certainty.]

The text includes references to "AFB" (likely Air Force Base) and seems to be describing some kind of object or event, but without risking misreading the handwritten text, I cannot confidently reproduce the entire narrative.

WITNESS # 4 (Independent)                                                                   Age: 14
                                                                                    Littleton, Massachusetts

[Redacted name] was in his bedroom when he heard an automobile horn being blown. (By Witnesses #1,2, & 3) He went to the window which overlooked "Porter Field" and saw three lights and the outline of the object hovering over the New Field. He watched it for about a minute before it moved off at high speed. The following day, Witnesses #1, 2, & 3 told him that a "Flying Saucer" had gone over his house to "Porter's Field" and asked if he had seen it. He told them that he had.

The following is the description of the object as given me by came from it. The object was "grayish-silver". A sound "like a low roar" was heard from it. The shape of the object was oval with a rim around the bottom. Its center 2 red lights, one on each end and white light on the top of the center part.

Lights pulsated but also compared them with the intensity of tail-lights of a car a block away. It seemed to be hovering 200 feet above the ground.

EVALUATION:

After interviewing and cross-checking the accounts given by the two witnesses, I have concluded that they were telling the truth. The research engineer who set up the interviews in his home also felt strongly that they were telling the truth and had questioned them himself before finalizing the interview arrangements. This engineer knows the boy very well and vouches for his integrity and his being a level-headed boy.

The Astronomical data on the UFO Data Sheet checks out. They all agreed that they saw a bright moon rising over the trees that evening. At 9:30 EDT the moon would have risen about 22 minutes previously.

Thus far no adult witnesses have been found. I checked with the Littleton Police station but they had received no UFO Report that evening and I feel sure that the officer was not covering up any reports.

I feel that the size of the objects could have been exaggerated as well as the half-hour chase. Except for this and minor differences in their drawings of the object and the area, this seems to be a factual UFO sighting. I will send additional UFO Data Sheets filled out by the other witnesses as well as any further information that may be turned up as soon as I receive such.

Fall Sightings in
Massachusetts

AFRO Member Raymond E. Fowler of
Wenham, Mass. carried out a careful investigation of sightings of strange aerial
objects during the fall of 1964, the results
of which were forwarded to APRO. We
present here the condensed findings. In
some instances names of witnesses are
omitted by request.

At 9:30 p. m. EDT, at Littleton, Mass.,
two teen-aged boys, James Gates and
John Thibault and a twelve-year-old boy
Norman G. Sheldrick, sighted a strange
aerial object over the Common and gave
chase in the car in which they were riding. After losing sight of it several times
they came upon it again at Porter Field,
outside of Littleton. The boys later described it as a silver gray, apparently solid
with an estimated length of 75-125 feet.
It was oval shaped and appeared to have
the bottom. It carried a "rim around
lights similar in intensity to an automobile's taillights a block distant. There was a red light on each end and
a white one on top in the middle. It
made a "soft roaring sound" similar to
that of a jet but not quite as loud.

The boys noted that the object was
hovering with a "fluttering motion" about
500-1000 feet away from them. When
they started to walk toward it the lights
went out and it sped away, disappearing
over the tree tops.

A fourth witness was later located,
John Marransino, 14, was in his bedroom
when he heard an automobile horn and
went to the window, which overlooks
Porter Field. He saw the three lights and
the outline of the object hovering over
the field. He watched it for about a
minute and then it moved away at
high speed. The next day, Gates, Thibault and Sheldrick went to the field,
gone right over his house and asked
he had seen it. He told them he had
Marransino's description tallies with
that of the first three witnesses. He did
not recall if the lights pulsated, but set-

Monitoring...
(Continued from page 1)

Mr. Fowler, after carefully crosschecking his witnesses, decided the sighting
was genuine.

Another sighting on the same night
(August 29th) came to light after the
investigation of the Littleton sighting,
which Mr. Fowler also investigated:

At 10:30 p. m. EDT, Richard Pratt, 17,
of Lynn, Mass., had just gotten out of his
car and was about to enter his home
when he heard a strange high-pitched
whistle or whining sound coming from
the top of Lenox Hill in back of his house. He looked up the hill and became frightened as he watched a silver oval-shaped
object about the "size of a regular automobile", slowly descending onto the hill
top about 300 yards away. It appeared
to have a rim of soft white light around
its perimeter and a dome-like protrusion
in the center. It hovered momentarily,
seemingly about four feet above the hill
top and then apparently landed out of
sight behind the shrubbery.

Richard told Mr. Fowler that he went
into the house and told no one. He did
not go to investigate because he was
afraid. He confided his experience to a
friend who in turn told the story to Richard Fowler, brother of Raymond Fowler,
and thus the sighting came to our attention.

During the course of his investigation,
Mr. Fowler contacted personnel at the
Lennox Hill Nursing Home, which is located on the opposite side of the hill from
Pratt's home, and is 1000 feet from the
estimated landing site of the UFO. He
found a nurse who was on duty on the
night in question, and although she could
not remember the exact time, recalled
that sometime after 9 p. m. she had
heard distinctly hearing a "high-pitched
whistling sound" on that night. She did
not investigate as she was very busy and
thought it was just another new type of
fire whistle.

Another nurse recalled seeing two boys
on the top of the hill searching for something. Fowler reports this was most likely Richard Pratt and his friend who went
to the site later to search for some sign
of the landing.

Fowler points out that an Electrical
Power Station is located behind the Lennox Hill nursing home. A similar sighting of a similar UFO in the general area
of Lynn, Mass. on June 15, 1964 was made
by AFRO member Walter Webb of Cambridge. Sketches of Walter's observation
were shown to Richard Pratt and he said
it looked almost identical to the one he
had seen.

Littleton, Mass.
25 August, 1964

Mr. Fowler checked with Moonwatch,
Hanscom AFB and the owners of a local
advertising airplane, and a scrutiny of
satellite passover times as well as the
flight path of the airplane strongly indicates that the objects seen were UFO (Unidentified).

SUBJECT     POSSIBLE UFO REPORT
LOCATION    Hondo Air Force Base, Texas                                DATE 27 August 1964

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF          9 mm 2 150N negative film strips with 6 frames each, 7 enlarged 160% prints, 1 enlarged
            160N negative, 1 75 frame roll of 160N color motion picture film

1. PURPOSE: This report answers MC 861-24 from Major Quintanilla, requesting evaluation
of photography containing images which might possibly be UFO's.

2. CIRCUMSTANCES: A photographer took pictures of a C-119 prop on Hondo Air Force Base,
parking to keep the C-119 centered. The photographer was not aware of the object until he
developed the film. The C-119 was not in focus. Approximately 200 feet west of the C-119 ground track, camera was located approximately 150° to 200° from the C-119 with a
camera height of approximately 1200 to 2800'.

3. ANALYSIS: The 9mm film strip was viewed under 10x to 100 X in an effort to determine the configuration of the unidentified object. Nothing was gained from the viewing other than the general shape of the object. The film strip was also viewed on a motion picture projector to determine the configuration of the object. No conclusive details could be determined due to the object's small size and rapid descent.

4. COMMENTS: The photographic investigation shows a piece of equipment which descended too rapidly to be a stationary object. The object's rate of descent appeared to be too fast to be a parachute or a piece of equipment dropped from an aircraft at altitude other than the C-119 being photographed.

5. We feel that the object in question is probably a stabilization chute, or a piece of
equipment dropped from an aircraft at altitude other than the C-119 being photographed.

Time: 9:30 EDT (approx.) P.M.

Duration of sighting: 1½ seconds

Conditions: Fine; no clouds, haze, etc. Many stars. Dry weather

The object appeared as a light. It was much brighter than all astronomical bodies except the sun, about as bright as a car headlight. The object was a fuzzy but not a round mass or elliptical white blotch, after which the brightness diminished.

Trail which may or may not have been a ground illusion:
The object was constantly in motion. A uniform motion. There was only a trail behind it which may or may not have been an actual cause. I believe that it was only an illusion caused by the speed of the object. There were no other features and no alterations of any kind.

Position at time of observation: Middleboro, Mass. 02346

I was setting my telescope for the planet Neptune when the object appeared in the same manner as described but as to the brightness in 1/10 of a second. It disappeared completely in full view apparently as if a light only had been turned off with no dimming effect whatever.

It never moved behind or in front of anything.

Color: very brilliant glowing white, almost a silver

Sound: absolutely none

A match head held at arm length would cover about 1/6 of the object.

Speed: no estimate possible because of the short time of observation

Distance: no estimate possible because of the short time of observation

Notes: as far speed and distance, all I can say is that the object traversed 50 degrees of the sky in 1½ seconds

The location was in the yard of my home. This is in the residential district

Of the two witnesses, only I wear eyeglasses

Gentlemen:

On August 29 at 12:45 A.M., I sighted a hard hazy disk(flying saucer) in two to three minutes, then settled across the sky. I was using binoculars to 8 x 50, and in the next yard of a house in the western sector of Athens, Alabama.

As I watched the sky, hazy light seemed to move in northwest direction. When it suddenly came very low, I was frightened and ran toward the house. In its flight, it seemed to arc around the edges. Its height flat to about the west.

The sky was very clear, slight wind at 85 degrees, to be precise. Looking in the [illegible]. No clouds was noted. I was able to observe it for several minutes. It seemed to hover, then move slowly. I observed it through binoculars.

I am prepared to leave a very accurate practice. It will speed up investigation. The object was not a town name, so it appeared to be a ball-like, night after appearance of some sort. The noise was slight that might be a slight account. The object was very dark and then appeared to glow.

Sent. was also scene by others. Friday, 1521 W. Cor. grove, also.

I would so appreciate any information concerning what I might have seen.

Sincerely,

Here is the text from the document:

A brief description could be that immediately after the object disappeared I looked like a comet, that is no way that I behind it which may not have existed gave it that appearance. At first it was a ball or light which began leaving the northeastern sky. I first recall whatever the full fades as the object progresses or if it went out abruptly as its own phase.

As appearance B: disappearance

I have never before seen a comparable object. I would like to point out that I have seen numerous and rare objects in connection with "ball lightning". I am an embarrassed observer and have a working knowledge of most of what "ball lightning" is. However, I know that these so-called "flying saucers" do exist and that they are intelligently controlled vehicles of some kind. I was not doing an on this night. I was employed in Lowell, Mass.

The other witness was the following who was the only other person with me and who also saw the same things:

[Redacted location, Mass.]
[Redacted name]
[Redacted location, Massachusetts]
Photo: [Redacted] Age 15

There are a few other things which I would like to point out... the object that was seen was quite small and within the very edges was like a comet. There was also many times brighter than a full moon; however the light from it did not seem to radiate because the ground did not seem to become at all bright.

ASTRONOMY

Saturn Now Prominent
Deneb, directly overhead, is one of four bright stars visible this month, and the planets Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury will shine in the late night sky.

By JAMES STOKLEY

▶ THE PLANET SATURN is now shining brightly in the southern evening sky. In position, in the constellation of Aquarius, the water carrier, is shown on the accompanying map. These picture the skies as they look about 11:30 p.m., your own kind of daylight saving time, on the first of September, an hour earlier in the middle of the month, and two hours earlier at the end.

Two bright first magnitude stars are now so low in the west that they are dimmed considerably by atmospheric absorption. The most prominent of all is Vega, high in the west in the constellation of Lyra, the lyre part of which is shown on each of the maps. Directly below Vega, just to the east of the northern sky, is Lyra, is Cygnus, the swan, with brilliant Deneb. The constellation is also drifted with other stars, and is high in the northern sky. To the southwest of Cygnus stands Aquila, the eagle, with another first magnitude star, Altair.

Low in the south, under Aquarius where Saturn now stands, you will find Fomalhaut in Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish.

This is one of the first magnitude stars now visible that is dimmed because it is so low. It is now nearly as high as it ever gets.

Near the western horizon, a little to the north, stands Arcturus, in Bootes, the herdsman, dimmed because it stands so close to the horizon. Visible in the low northeast is Capella in Auriga, the charioteer.

Later, during September nights, the other planets will come into view. By midnight Jupiter will be shining brightly toward the east, in Taurus, the bull. It is about 15 times as bright as Saturn, so you will have no difficulty locating it. A little later Mars rises, in Cancer, the crab.

Venus rises about an hour after Mars, or about three hours ahead of the sun. It is brightest of all—exceeding Jupiter more than four times. For about a week, around Sept. 16, Mercury will be visible low in the east, just before sunrise.

On Sept. 22, at 3:17 a.m. EDT, the sun will be at the autumnal equinox, the half-way point in its southward journey through the sky, begun on June 21. This equinox marks the beginning of a period in the Northern Hemisphere, and of spring in countries south of the equator.

As indicated in the Celestial Time map, the full moon at the end of this article, the full moon that occurs on the night of Sept. 21 will be the "harvest moon." The peculiar feature of the harvest moon is the small difference between its time of rising and night and the next. At 40 degrees north, for example, it rises on the 21st 29 minutes later than on the 20th. On the 22nd it rises only 27 minutes later than on the 21st.

In contrast, that moon rises at 40 degrees north for the full moon on March 27 was one hour and four minutes later than on the 26th.

The reason for such differences is the changing angle with the horizon made by the moon's path through the sky, during which the sun seems to move during the year. The moon and the planets also stay close to this line. Each day the moon moves about the same distance of some 13 degrees along this line toward the east.

In March during the early evening, the ecliptic extends almost vertically from the eastern horizon, but in September its angle is much smaller, more nearly parallel to the horizon. As a result, the moon does not rise later each night, and the moon's path, moreover, this movement, at such a low angle, takes it only a little farther below the horizon than it was the night before. Thus there is a minimum delay at night rising from one night to the next.

Since September is the time when farmers are harvesting their crops and may have to work at night to get them in, the series of moonlit nights makes it easier for them, and gives the "harvest moon" its name.

Brightest Asteroids Visible

Another feature of this year's September evening skies is that they offer the chance of seeing the brightest of the so-called "minor planets," or asteroids. These are numbers of a swarm of many thousands of small planets that move in orbits between Mars and Jupiter. Most of them are visible only with large telescopes, although a few can be seen with the naked eye or with small binoculars.

But one of them, named Vesta, has moved On Sept. 2, Vesta, which is 241 miles in

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for August 22, 1964                                121

E FIELDS
GEOLOGY
Smithsonian Acquires
Important Meteorites

▶ AN IMPORTANT COLLECTION of
meteorites from the estate of the late Arthur
R. Allen of Trinidad, Colo., has been acquired by the Smithsonian Institution. Mr.
Allen, a student of rocks, spent much of
his adult life collecting meteorites from Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma.

The Allen collection includes 45 meteorites, 11 of which were not previously reported. The collection represents important
Natural History specimens. It also includes
several hundred tekites, mollavites and
australites.

The Smithsonian has one of the world's
leading meteorite collections.

DEMOGRAPHY
Early Marriages Raise
Population Growth Rate

▶ THE WIDESPREAD TREND of teenage marriage in the United States could
add as much as 25 percent to the current 1.97 rate despite attempts to limit family size by birth control.

This is the conclusion of a Cornell University sociologist, Prof. J. Mayone Stycos,
who has been studying population problems. Prof. Cole said that the younger mother, the earlier her children can have offspring, and the more children she bears, the more women in America today
tend to marry early.

"Merely reducing the number of children
per family is much less important than
preventing early marriage," he said.

▶ Prof. Stycos studied the population patterns in Puerto Rico and applied his findings to the
problem of human population control.

ENGINEERING
Refrigerated Clothing
For Summers of Future

▶ A DISCOVERY that will bring refrigerated summer clothing closer to reality was
reported by engineers at the National Heat
Transfer Conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
Dr. Jack B. Chaddock, professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, and his associates, a research engineer with the Frigidaire division
of General Motors Corporation in Dayton,
Ohio, reported they have found a way to
create heat-conducting clothing by using thermoelectric refrigeration units.

ZOOLOGY
Foxes Like Mice on Menu,
Find Birds Less Tasty

▶ THE WILY FOX, often blamed for
losses of pheasants, eats far more mice than
game birds, stomach examinations show.
To get a better understanding of the
eating habits of the fox, the Wisconsin
Conservation Department examined more
than 2,000 fox stomachs from hunters and
trappers during the winters of 1959 and
1962.

The contents of the stomachs showed
that mice made up more than half of the
fox diet in most winters. Cottontail rabbits,
ground squirrels and other small mammals
were next in importance. Surprisingly, few
game birds and animals to foxes could be
avoided by prowling a better distribution
of winter food and cover for them on
intensively farmed lands.

DERMATOLOGY
New Medications Also
Cause Skin Disturbance

▶ SKIN ERUPTIONS are caused by many
newer drugs, as well as older drugs, a
dermatologist reports. George W. Cline,
ton School of Medicine, warned that the
variety of medications now on the market
are likely to have side effects. He reported
his findings at the National Medical Association meeting in Washington, D.C.

EDUCATION
Federal Humanities
Foundation Asked

▶ RECOGNIZING the revolutionary importance in science research and education
of the humanities, more than a decade of operation of the federal support of National Science Foundation grants in the humanities are urging similar support for their fields of learning.

A Commission on the Humanities has
been calling through a report through the
National Academy of Sciences in New York, calling for the creation of a National Humanities Foundation.

▶ A gifted individual, whether poet or
physicist, the report contended, needs to have a broad understanding of human
accomplishments in the humanities—history, literature, arts, religion and philosophy.

"Democracy demands wisdom of the
average man," the report noted. "All men
in a democracy need to understand values
which includes such enduring values as
justice, freedom, virtue, beauty and truth."

marked for various days of the month.
Perhaps you can pick it up with the naked
eye if you are away from the glare of city lights. But it will be much
easier if you use binoculars.
First pick up Saturn, and then go toward
the east, which brings you to the fourth
magnitude star in Aquarii. Then down,
and a little to the left, and you come to
Vesta Aquarii or Skat. Still further and
more to the left—a distance more than
twice that from the top to delta, and come
to 88, also of the fourth magnitude.
Vesta will be between these, and about
midway as bright as delta. By watching for
several nights, you can see its motion.

URO OBEYS RADAR CONTROLLER?

ABJ... August 15, 1964... The serie obedience to command from FAA* controller of March AF Base in S. California by an unidentified aircraft brought death to three.

It has been determined that the pilot confirming controller instructions was outside the range of radar, and that another "unidentified radar object" obeyed the controller's commands. The aircraft, piloted by Maj. J. Corder, of Covina, California, flew into 11,600 ft. ML San Giorgino. He was following orders to fly at 7,200 feet.

The "unidentified radar object" which obeyed three previous commands, suddenly turned right, toward the west. The controller asked the west-moving larger to make a 100° heading which it ignored. Corder obeyed it and destroyed himself and two passengers.

Ontario Airport was told to watch for the "disobedient" radar target which was flying directly toward them. The Ontario AP later reported seeing a light plane east of them, but it never was identified. Why not?

THIS WAS ECHO?

The night before all the excitement of August 17, Mrs. Robert Smith of 630 Marshall Drive in Painesville related this story when interviewed. At around 10:00 P.M., she had put her husband and two sons to bed. She was dark. She looked out her back window and saw this thing coming from the southwest with an azimuth reading of 305° (almost NW). She then went out into the yard to watch it, calling soon after to her husband and two sons. She said it passed under the last star of the hands of the Big Dipper. It proceeded toward them and at an elevation of 60° or more and almost E direction (SE). This a little beyond, it turned to an almost S direction. She and her object had a steady white color and that it had turned sharply in some manner. All 3 agreed that it had turned to the E. Trees close off viewing very far into the south.

The Telegraph, of Painesville, asked the Soho Labs Satellite Tracking Center about it, and subsequent sighting in the morning hours of the 17th. The experts were covered & all with one blanket. Echo 1. (Moves W-E, usually)

The observers heard no sound, no other lights seen, no trail.
Observers: Mrs. Robert Smith, Robert, 11, and Thomas, 11 years
Old.

Duration: 7 min. for Mrs. Smith, 3-5 min. for Robert and Thomas.

17 August, 1964
Chardon, Ohio

Chardon, Ohio ... August 17, 1964, 4:00-6:00 A.M. ...
Mr. George Inaman and Clyde Young also observed what probably
was the same object from outside the police station at the source
Both said that through binoculars (7x35) it was red in the bottom
and white on top. Mr. Young defined it as a bright light with two
smaller lights circling around it. He watched from 4:00-4:40 A.M.

Mr. Inaman said that without the binoculars (Mr. Young's)
the object was very bright. With the binoculars, there was a circular outline, but the surface of the object was not clear.

At about 5:00 A.M., he saw two green "light-ball-like" surfaces. At a point about 500 A.M., he saw the object still visible while circling the center in a counter-clockwise fashion. After its second circling, the object moved southward a short distance and disappeared. At about 5:00 A.M., the object disappeared completely for about 10-15 minutes. Yet, no clouds were noted. Mr. Inaman, a gas station attendant of 42 years, left home at about 6:30 A.M. The object was still visible and had risen to a higher angle of elevation. Mr. Inaman wore glasses.

Summation: Only one object of large size, the direction was
directly E, and the climb of the object was at a slight angle to the
S. Its highest elevation was 40°. Duration, direction, elevation
coincide with Venus, but what about the faint, circling objects?

Editorial Comment:
In all cases, only one bright object was seen in the eastern
sky. The continuous observations started at 3:30-4:00 and ended
at 6:00-6:30 A.M. with the sunrise. No dark object was seen where
the object had been. No sound was heard. Two (2) faint star-like objects going
N-S cannot be explained by one Echo 11, which on rare occasions
can be seen taking this path. The W-E object could have been
Echo I, if exact times coincided with its passage. Exact times were
not noted by the observers.

Summation: Large bright object was the planet Venus. Atmospheric
conditions contributed to some of the effects noted. But the rest
many of 4 witnesses relating to 2 objects seen moving N-S puts
these in the unidentified class.

Editorial Comment:
Sohio Lab's Tracking Center blanketed the whole sighting
with Echo I, without adequate knowledge.

The newspapers, The Telegraph and Cleveland Plain Dealer
also are too prone to go off "half-cocked" in following "expert"
advice.

Informed on CFIF     (No Case)                                                17 August, 1964
Denver, PSID                                                                  Cleveland, Ohio

                                        WAS IT VENUS?

On the morning hours of August 17, several law enforcement officers as well as civilians of the lake-bordering counties, east of Cleveland, reported strange celestial phenomena.

Radio-communications carried the word, and small aggregations of officers gathered at different locations to observe the strange light or lights in the eastern sky.

W. Candusso, of PSIC, and Gary Davis, of MUS, of Medina, were on the scene the same night of the sighting (Monday, August 17).

Ft. George Miller of Mentor-on-Lake, and Ron Deitrick, guard at the Yacht Club docks showed us the viewing spot. A co-observer (3 in all here) Councilman Robert Tailor, of Mentor-on-Lake was not present.

The very brilliant, white object was seen in the eastern sky. It was the only bright object in the clear, crisp sky; the real being ordinary stars. The object seemed to drop in place, diminish in size and return to brilliance. At one time it disappeared completely for 5-10 minutes. They said the object remained stationary or seemed to be a little higher and to the right. As the sun rose, the stars disappeared, but this object remained visible for sometime before being overcome by the sun's light.

Summation: The time, direction, duration, description coincides with the planet Venus, which rises about 3 hours before the sun. The unusual effects - probably unusual atmospheric conditions.

(Remaining sighters interviewed by Editor.)

Doc. Sheriff Michael Gence, of Lake County joined two other officers on the bridge spanning I-90 and S.R. 306. The brilliant white light was again visible as large as a cup (apparent size). It was directly E, and hovering above the trees. It receded rapidly getting much smaller, then returning to its original brilliance. In this cycle of increase, it took on a half-halo on its N side, but became a full horizontal blue halo as it returned to its full size. The halo was close to the central object. On two occasions there seemed to be a red flame or flash coming out of the bottom right area.

his elevation seemed to vary, and it bounced back and forth. His
estimate of elevation was 101-15°. It didn't seem to be far, and it
was low, according to the witness. He didn't give any further details.

Genco gave the position of Jupiter, when asked if he had seen
the planet Venus or some other bright star. Only one object was seen.
At one time he said the object in question was 3-4 times the brightness
of the bright star. (He meant Jupiter.)

On I.S. 90 and relocated S.R. 44, deputies Albert Schlegel
and Sheldon Hope watched the object, later joined by Sgt. Minor.
All are from Lake County's Sheriff's Department.

Dep. Schlegel determined that the object was directly E (used
compass). Personally, I think it was moving, but it was so low and
or small. It was moving and just hovering at times. I didn't
stop because it stopped, and just hovered. I didn't see any
see any red flames." Dep. Schlegel said, (This quotation taken from
The Telegraph, Painesville, Ohio.) Schlegel began his watch at
approx. 8:00 A.M.

Sgt. Minor joined Dep. Hope and Dep. Schlegel at 8:00 A.M.
He was a very white looking searchlight-head object which danced
from side to side. It would brighten each time it started moving.
Later two star-like objects were seen moving from N-S. They first
were seen N of the large object, moving slowly one above the other,
the top one preceding and almost level with the main object. When
the top (star-like) object was a short distance past the main object,
a flame seemed to shoot out between them from the larger body.
After this something else distracted him, and Minor said he
never saw that smaller object again. The other star-like object continued south and disappeared in the distance. Its passage took
8-10 minutes. Dep. Hope saw only the lower object going N-S
and agreed as to its duration of 8-10 min.

Sgt. Minor mistook Jupiter for Venus, and said he object in
the east was considerably larger than "Venus" which he said was
very high in the sky.

Dep. Sheldon F. Hope described the sidewise dance as being
limited to its own diameter. The object was extremely bright and
white, and so large that you'd have to push it to get it in a bushel
basket." he said. Its altitude was about 4,000 feet. Its elevation,
which didn't change, according to him, was 40-50 degrees. He
started his watch at 4:30 and ended it at after 5:30 A.M. At one
time the object seemed to increase to great proportions, many times
its ordinary size.

Then Sgt. Minor spotted two faint white objects. One was moving N-S, the other W-E. Both objects were at about the same angle
of elevation, one 33° E, the other 38° S. As the N-S object was
passing by the large, stationary object, a source of light was seen
to grow at a place to the right and just below the main object. It
was a dull yellow or dull reddish.

Its duration was only a couple of seconds. The N-S object
continued into the S, and disappeared. The W-E object was seen
only a short time. No one mentioned seeing it disappear.

Ohio State Patrolman Chaffin was party to this observation.

Four meteors were seen during the observation: 3 moving
generally N-S, the other low in the S, moving E-W. Sgt. Minor
claims seeing two baseball-sized fireballs (white and no tail), one at
1:30 and another about 4:30 in the A.M. The Perseids were most prominent on August 12th.

Note: Several citizens were alerted during this time. Chief Ladd
[police] of Madison, and Constable Walsh were at Sgt. Minor's 4:30
A.M. fireball site.

17 August, 1964
Willoughby, Ohio

A NIGHT WHEN EXCITEMENT REIGNED
August 17, 1964... Larry Browand and Wayne Merrell, Patrolmen of Willoughby police department probably started the real excitement of the night.

Ptl. Brown told of the episode. At 3:30 A.M. they were proceeding E on S.R. 84 between Kirkland and Daniel Park. "A bright glow was seen to our right at low altitude just over the tree tops." (This would be SE) They stopped their car. The object seemed to be going a way from them. They followed the reddish-orange glow to Kirkland Road, then on to S.R. 308. From Kirkland Road which runs E there, the object was to the S. Travelling S on S.R. 306 the object was parallel to the highway, and to the right. The object stopped, however, then a flame or light fell out of it into the tree section along S.R. 306. They continued in pursuit S on S.R. 306, then E on Eagle Mills Rd. to Booth Rd. At Booth Rd. they

got out of their car there to the E was the orange object. Using the road and top of a house as points of reference, they found that the object was moving steadily in a NE direction.

They then went to S.R. 306 and I.S. 90; the bridge there makes for good viewing. They couldn't locate the light anywhere. That ended the sighting for Ptl. Brown and Merrell. Brown had called the Nike Site. The person answering said nothing was picked up on radar.

The object was described as of small size, low altitude - and of unusual color (reddish-orange).

While on the bridge, Dep. Sheriff Michael Genco joined them.

At 4:40 A.M. the planet Venus was seen to rise low on the horizon.
Sgr. Turner of Willoughby came out, agreed that this was Venus.

Ptl. Brown and Merrell then admitted somewhat reluctantly that it was commendable. (from our point of view)

They went back to S.R. 84 where they had first spotted the UFO; they found nothing there resembling what they had seen. Even Venus was not visible. They also backtracked to Kirkland Rd. - nothing.

Nothing resembling the UFO was seen there, but Venus was to their left or N., whereas previously it had been to their right or S.

Their call to their office wasn't made till 3:48 A.M. 18 minutes after first observing the object.

On the same day Ptl. Merrell returned to where the UFO had dropped the flame or light. He found no burned spots or anything else of relevant value.

This spot is on S.R. 84 near the residence at 38800. The flame dropped into the area directly to the right of the above named residence.

The reddish-orange object seemed to be only 2 feet higher than the trees when the flaming object was dropped.

O.S.P. Jack Robinson from the Chardon office was interviewed by WHLQ's John O'Day. Between 4:5 A.M. a large white light like a satellite was seen moving around in irregular, circular motion, sometimes stopping. 2 or 3 smaller white objects left the larger light at a rather fast rate of speed. He doubled Polaris explanation given him.

No other information on this one.

Ashtabula, Ohio - August 17 - Police report sighting a UFO with a bright light so early on this date. According to the Highway Patrol it would first travel in a straight line and then a circle, and appeared to be about 1600 feet in altitude. The object reportedly hovered over Interstate 90, where earlier this year another UFO was seen hovering.

20 August 1964

August;
Here is the information regarding the photo which you now have in your possession.

The sighting was made on the evening August 20, 1964 at 11:15. The object was traveling in a south easterly direction maintaining a constant speed of 600 mph. It was light blue in color with a variation in light output.

The U.F.O. changed direction at 11:15(da northland) then open a vertical climb. As it was velocity increased the color changed from light blue to brilliant orange. The last two factors are purely guesses work on my part. I would say that the object was directly over the Hudson River and reached a velocity in excess of 1000 mph when contact was lost.

I would say that my guess work is fairly accurate, because of my training in the Civil Air Patrol. Contact was lost at 11:17.

The camera used was Ziess Ikon with a 1.5 lens, set at a two second exposure with the aperture wide open.

Do the field objects stay, color, climbing ability, speed, and erratic motion? I feel that as say it was not of earthly origin, (I am sure) have been an experimental aircraft in the bomber category, because of its large size.

I am almost positive that the U.F.O. was interplanetary in nature.

Your Friend

P.S.
I enclose a diagram of the sightings.

CIGAR ON FACE OF MOON

At about 5:30 A.M. (August 27), 19 year old Dan Boros reported he saw a cigar-shaped craft, with lighted port-holes, crossing the face of the moon slowly; then pick up speed and vanish in the east.

He is a night watchman for Neil Greenhouse, Inc., 2045 on Rte. 91, Gates Mills. When he made the report he sounded shaken.

"When it started to pick up speed after I had gone across the face of the moon, a light glowed all around it and it trailed smoke for about five seconds," he said. "I would judge it was 50 to 80 feet long."

Earl Neff, of C.U.P., taped the report. Neff thought that Boros undoubtedly saw a "mother ship which could have been larger." "I think he underestimated the size. It must have been much larger. It was interplanetary, and we don't often get reports on them."

Another Disc Near
White Sands

On 29 August 1964, Mr. P. D. Snow was driving south from Las Cruces, New Mexico toward El Paso on Highway Interchange 10. To his left (East) were the Organ Mountains. The time was 11:50 a.m.

Snow noticed a large, saucer-shaped object between him and the mountains (about half way between ground level and the peaks) and travelling south at high speed. The object appeared to be about four miles away and larger than a silver dollar held at arm's length.

The object stayed below the peaks as he observed it from Mesilla Park, New Mexico, to Mesquite, New Mexico where the Mountain Range and at this point, the object banked up at a 45 degree angle and disappeared into the sky.

A passenger with Mr. Snow observed and reported the same incident. The Organ Mountains mark the West edge of the White Sands Proving Ground Test Range.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

DAYLIGHT MANEUVERS OF UFO

Garfield Heights, Ohio... August 31, 1964... 11:16 A.m.
to 11:50 A.M. EDT... On this clear windy day, at least a
dozen residents of Thraves Road and nearby streets in the
immediate area. The main scene were the backyards of Orme,
Gnania, Havana, and Thraves Roads, just west of Turney Road.

As far as this report goes, it was Mrs. Joseph Fejtek who saw
the object first. Soon, her 16 year old son Joseph her, next came
Mr. Ronald Fejtek, who was in the backyard of his Thraves Road
yard neighbor.

Joseph Sems of Thraves Road also saw the object, as did
Mrs. Kindra Others, whose names we have, who were testimony
to the fact that the object was in the sky over their backyards
over her backyard, where she was hanging her wash. After watching the "beautiful object" for about 5 minutes, she rushed into the
house and called her husband, who came out and looked for
his spectacles. One more good look, and he was back in the
house getting his polaroid camera. (J-66-10 sec.) (Time narrated by TV program Ronald had been watching.)

By this time, Mrs. Di Franco, who was also doing her wash,
had come out and was watching. She said the object was reddish-orange in color, and proceeded to take photograph No. 1. Even though
he was aiming at a NWNW direction and at about 50 degrees
elevation, the picture was completely over exposed. Pictures No.
2 and 3 show a day spot in the sky.

Mrs. Di Franco said that the object remained stationary and
made his first attempt, and that the object gained altitude before
he could take the next two "successful" photos. Mrs. Di Franco
and Mrs. Fejtek both watched and verified the results of these
attempts. She was mystified by the size of the object representing a disc whose color was a thin disc whose color was a
royal blue luminous blue. The object was tilted and tapered
gradually toward the edges. This part was reddish-orange with
a spike of the same color protruding from the top, and another
spike at the bottom. (Reminds one of a classic flying saucer
the raised part were noted by her.) Seasid it appeared to become
lighter in color as time went on. She compared it to a quarter
seen on edge at arm's length. The elevation of the object varied
from 4 one of 30 degrees to a high of close to 60 degrees. As it
moved, it seemed to have a slight wobble, like a pendulum
to her chore of washing clothes. In all Mrs. Di Franco watched
about 20 minutes, as the went in and out of her basement. (Mrs.
Di Franco is a housewife, 35 years old, living on Thraves Road.)

Joseph Sems, 15, who was on his bicycle also saw the object,
but all slightly different. He was just north of this area, at most a quarter mile away.
When first seen, the object was at
about 15 degrees elevation, and as he watched, it rose to about
50 degrees. It was at about 50 degrees, an increase of 5 degrees.

The object was a medium red, and somewhat football-shaped.
He was looking at the object which seemed tilted back away from
him, and said it was slightly raised on top. The peculiarity noted
was an antenna, or like structure, protruding above the horizon,
also red in color. He also saw an antenna, or like structure,
providing above red before the main body of the object. His
estimate of size varied from a penny to a half dollar at arm's
length.

Ronald Fejtek's description takes on a more "conventional
saucer" form. The base was blue with a raised dome of reddishorange. Protruding from above the dome and below the base,
was a spike or protrusion of the same reddish-orange color.
This agrees with Mrs. Di Franco's statement. The object was
for as much as a minute stationary, and then began to move
cosmics. It moved laterally 1-1/2 to 2 feet of sky as seen between two counted zero that far apart. He noticed movement was smooth and deliberate, making the sighting quite successful.

As he is leaving the area, Ronald was the only one (known)
who saw it go. He said it rose vertically, leveled, and flew westward at high speed. Within 90-45 seconds he lost sight of it at
about 20 miles distance. The time of total sighting was about
34 minutes.

Mrs. Fejtek, who saw it first, saw the "beautiful object" for
about 20 of the 35 minutes the object was in sight. She had work
to do, and assigned Ronald the task of keeping watch.

Editor's Comment:
Unless the object was very small, the photos show an object
in excess of 500 feet. Many who have seen the photos agree
the angle of elevation (20 degrees) at which it disappeared from
sight, also seems to bear out that it was a small object, or one
quite close to the ground.

Further details:
Mrs. Fejtek, Ronald Fejtek, and Joseph Sems estimated its
altitude at about 500 feet. Mrs. Di Franco guessed it was as high
as the altitude at which large planes pass over the area. (3,500)

The rate of rotation for Mrs. Fejtek was once very 2 seconds,
for Ronald once every 2 seconds. Mrs. Di Franco once every
5 seconds. All agreed it was a disc-like object.

Ronald Fejtek and Mrs. Di Franco heard a humming sound.
Like the hum of a TV, or radio warning up, said Ronald.

Mrs. J. Fejtek thought she might have heard a humming
sound but wasn't sure. Joseph Sems heard no sound.

Ronald called the Cleveland Plain Dealer almost immediately
after the end of the sighting. They ignored his story. He told him
he would bring his photos to him. He determined that the object was
bring his photos to him. He determined that the object was too
small for printing, but did publish a small article about the
sighting.

Dr. and Mrs. [REDACTED]
Calumet, Michigan

Several nights ago some friends of ours spotted seven of these "stars" moving through the sky. When the objects were nearly directly overhead, they stopped. Our friends watched for half an hour, during which time the objects remained stationary. Finally, our friends went in the house and went to bed, not knowing how long the objects remained in the stationary position.

We've acquired the habit of going out nearly every night, now, and watching for these "stars", and never disappointed. They can be seen most any night, and some nights we see several.

One more thing. One night we saw an object traveling through the sky at a seemingly lower altitude than the stars. Altitude of the object was difficult to judge. The strange thing about this one was the fact that its light glowed on and off...not like a light being turned on and off, but a gradual brightening, and then a gradual dimming, but completely dark. This one moved quite rapidly, and was visible for only a minute, or maybe less.

Headquarters

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sirs:

This communication to you is relative to an unidentified object which I saw near Uniontown, Pennsylvania on Aug. 12, 1964 around 1:30 - 2:00 A.M. Wednesday morning.

About a year ago, I listened to a discussion on radio relative to success and unidentified objects seen by pilots and others at various places and times in this country. When the discussion finished, the people taking part in it suggested that if anyone saw a flying object that it should be reported in detail & by comparison of reports there could be some evolution made of the possibility of causes.

On the above date, I was another fellow who was sleeping in my car, and his inability to sleep disturbed me, and I am turned unable to sleep.


- page 239 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

9 decided to get up, and as I did I glanced out the window, and saw a large red light flashing on and off in the sky. And at first, I thought it was just another red light on an airplane flashing as it traveled. But further observation showed that this red light did not move, but stood stationary in the sky, and it was then that my curiosity was aroused - so I continued to watch the object and told my friend to observe it.

Now, I'd like to impress on you that this was not a radio tower as I saw it in a different direction.

Further observance of the object revealed that it had the ability to stay stationary in the sky or on a flash of an eye take off like a bullet, which it did for a mile or two, and come to a sudden stop in a flash of an eye becoming stationary again. Then, it could also maneuver at a slow pace, going up and down much as a satellite appears to do as it orbits the earth.


- page 240 -

Here is the text from the document:

This was not a satellite as it did not have the attitude to be in space, and the satellites I have observed travel more or less at a constant speed, and this object could travel like a jet and turn able to stop & hover, again immediately.

I hope this information will be useful to you in your efforts to determine the possibility of the existence of saucers or space crafts, and I might add that what I and my friend saw - I only hope was some American invention for in the hands and design of an enemy it could be deadly in the view of destruction to our democratic way of life. Also, really, we weren't interested or are ready to preclude more information if possible if I shall have omitted something that should be helpful.

Sincerely Yours,

August 13, 1964

[Redacted location], Michigan

Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

I am in receipt of your letter of 13 August 64. Thank you for your letter and be assured that I appreciate your interest in aerial phenomena.

Your letter tells me which specific dates and times of your observations, methods, etc. will help me to pinpoint the exact phenomena which you observed. From the information such you have given me, I can only assume certain things; however, I am fairly certain that you have observed the satellites ICO I and ICO II on some occasions, and possibly balloons on other occasions. You are in an area, where satellites and balloons are quite common, and heavy balloons released after dark carry a warning light. The light on the balloon carries two purposes. It warns aircraft that an object is in the area and to keep observers on the ground to calculate its motion and direction. I am enclosing an OSCO schedule for your area, so that you might look at the satellites as they go by. The times will be off by a few minutes, because I do not have an exact schedule for Calima. If the satellites are coming from the northeast, it should be a couple of minutes earlier and 12 they are coming from the southeast, the time indicated should be a couple of minutes later.

Thanks again for your letter and hope my explanations will help your future observations.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.

Guy Risen Tells
Of WFAA Farm Tour

By E. GUY RISEN

I do not know to what extent some notes and observations on the recent WFAA Farm Tour may interest your readers.

All along the route the people were predominantly White and we saw many nice homes, lovely lawns and beautiful parks.

At Minneapolis we were entertained with some costume and folklore dances by some nice children direct from the Ukraine. They said they had found employment as teachers, office girls and others. The pianist said she was from Germany. In appearance they were typical Americans.

It is the policy of the Canadian and I believe the American governments to give preferences to village students for waitresses and bus drivers, etc., in the National Parks and they come from everywhere. In Jasper Park, Canada, a waitress who spoke seven languages was from Poland. "A lady who was born in England and a very attractive girl just told me she was from Paris, Christ, Texas.

We visited the largest truck farm, the largest seed farm, and the largest raw milk farm in Oregon. The truck farm strawberries were picked in from the field to market in four hours were ready to go. I saw 100 acres of beans in a big state of cultivation but not rocky land.

Texas lawn grasses do not grow where the ground freezes. I saw grass is most generally used and the seed farm had over 100 varieties.

We were told that labor could be imported from Mexico, and that people would work for them and that they produce more for them and that they probably would not have to pay them as much. In the next town we saw students there who were working for their board and going to school.

From the Red River to Canada, the Foot Hills of the Rockies to the Black Hills of Dakota, where the famous Mt. Rushmore Monument is carved; which may indicate they are older and the sedimentary rock weathered more rapidly there. This land is regarded as a very old formation and the bare granite may have once been covered with hundreds of feet of sedimentary rock.

In many places railroads and highways, a follow along the stream and are blasted out of solid rock-cliff. In several places our railroad bridged to the other side of the gorge and further on we could look back. On one part of the trip the track followed along the Fraser River where the Picture River of No Return, in which the water was so milky white Monroe started, was filmed.

In the mountains the West Coast we saw pines, pines and more pines, thick and tall. Lying up in the mountains they were standing in snow on the first of July and looked like they had been there a long time. But they were there, and every tiny Island in the many lakes, were thick with pines. In some of the mountain locks were loveliest the temperature was about 70 to 80 in the port, Texas, the cattle population was quite thin. In numbers and not so good. Across Canada we saw a few small herds of very good looking Black Angus, not many. From quality looking heads of Herefords until we arrived in Western Washington. Neither did we see many sheep. About 300 head of Black faces and some Merino, the largest herd I noticed in Canada.

A large and efficient cattle feeder in Central said his grain was costing 30 cents per pound. Although he was feeding him $15.00 per cwt. a feeder in Washington said he was feeding 100 lbs. of potatoes plus some dry feed per day. Her head did not know whether he was making or losing. But he was feeding some fun. His cattle seemed to be having fun too the way they were eating. They were sound and nicely around the pen. An Exchange paper said "Count me out."

I saw very few fences. I admired Across Canada most of them looked like stakes driven in the ground with only two and three strands of wire, and poorly kept. It seems to me a good many posts, it seems to me, are not identified here.

Pare granite was much more

which is receding at the rate of 100 feet per year. As it did so it left huge piles of rocks ground into about half mud and dirt and half boulders. If 100 feet of ice could do that, imagine what a glacier which extended almost half across the United States and which is estimated to have been several thousand feet thick, must have done much more. In places we were told the glacier deposits were 1000 feet deep.

I believe the best land we saw was a wide river valley near Scotts Bluff, Nebraska, where the famous Oregon Trail passed. It looked like the land could be 10 or more of Black top soil and was only 8 to 10 feet to water. I wondered about the possibility of getting through the dead-end Darner Trail where no man had gone before to get to Oregon.

I remarked to our guide that the rolling hills around Omaha looked like they had done been Sand Dunes. He said I was right—that it was an ancient desert which had become more fertile and built some top soil. Rolling like we have in Texas would have washed a way in no time, but they were just beginning to terrace. In Central Montana where the rainfall was from 10 to 12 inches, they were doing a good desert. Near Billings, Montana we saw 100,000 acres of very fine land irrigated by gravity from the Yellow River. Most of it was owned and operated by Russians and Germans who arrived there about 50 years ago.

From Winnipeg we could see in any direction. The land look as we look at a lake or water and the top soil is so deep. From there a few small rocks began to appear, the top soil became thinner and clumps of trees appeared, which we were told, was where the settlers had homesteaded. The land was good—which leads up to the point that from the Red River to Winnipeg, and from there to the Foot Hills of the Rockies we saw wheat, wheat and more wheat. I asked people who had traveled in Canada if it was that way back from the railroads and they said it was that way everywhere they had been. In and around dry Montana it was quite the custom to keep the land well cultivated and moisture to raise a wheat crop the second.

In the Rockies the crumbling rocks, and upheaval had come from beneath and elevated the sedimentary rocks, or rocks that were once deposited by a sea. Thousands of feet above sea level, where we could hear the water rushing down rocks in mountain rapids.

and no one had ever seen the like of mosquitos. They were keeping their cattle out under poison weeds, and what do you think they were? One of the Texas Blue Bonnet. I found Texas does not have a monument. Another was the blue Larkspur which is becoming common in San Saba. I asked what the symptoms were, and they said a dead animal. They had several other grasses, Spear grass and several other grasses and plants called Chest, which I have heard of but do not know locally in San Saba until the past few years. It is a relative of Blue grass but is regarded as a nuisance and liability.

I asked how their 8 to 12 inch lakes and ponds the many lakes and ponds the glaciers had scooped out full of water, and they said they did not have the evaporation we have and where the snow melted the ground was frozen and most of the snow water ran off. Owing to mineral in the water they only irrigate from them once a year.

The Japanese had the largest exhibit at the Oregon Centennial Trade Fair. In one place we were cautioned that most of the Indian Relics "sold" in the National Park were made in Japan.

We were shown through two very interesting military bases. In a corner was a vault deep underground, presenting some buttons. In a few minutes the United States could have planes loaded with Atom Bombs in the air, from bases all over the world. It passed through my mind that people who live and think may be inadvertently led to do things which they would not do if they took time to count.

In the other area, there were some Japanese taking a trip. I may be an old fogy, but it looks to me like it was just a mania which is going to cost the taxpayers an enormous lot of money and some good men their lives. Living conditions either of the Poles or on top of the Himalayan Mountain, compared to live conditions in outer Spaces, and how many people want to go to outer places.

A great deal of construction work is needed to do prophylactic highways and for business purposes.

I should have said in the beginning we stayed each night in a very comfortable house plus several other places.

The Mount Rushmore Exhibit was very interesting.

Thinking Of Survival

EDITOR, Standard-Times:
John S. Knight, editor of The Detroit Free Press, says the while man is through a "dark night of the soul."

Thanks to our many programs for teaching nations and races, that already far outnumber us and that are increasingly much faster; everything we know, the white man is through in most of the rest of the world and don't know it.

During the past several centuries the white race sailed in wooden ships progressive white race still "the Seas." Among other things, they changed America from a country of dirt-floored tents and huts, where wheels and machines were unknown; to a country with the highest standard of living the world knows.

In this century everything the white man did is being denounced and condemned. Among other things, the white man is losing racial pride and esteem, the whites, are being taught and told that would be racial bigotry and should not be tolerated; even though it seems quite all right for other races to have several organizations.

The white people in Africa are trying to do exactly what the pioneers did in America except they are not exterminating the natives like we did the Indians. But our "foreign policy" is to pressure them to turn their property and investments over to the natives and set out. Just as we pressured England to turn the Suez Canal over to Egypt, and as we pressured France to turn her in the Panama Canal is to us, over to Nasser.

It is high time for the white people of the world to do like even the ancient walled cities were built which is why we are spending billions for defense; and we had better not expect it to in the future.

E. G. Hicks, San Saba.

Here is the text from the document:

Letters To The Editor

It seems to me that the Nations and people of the world, especially the United States and Russia, are "using and quarreling like children; and feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys of Kentucky Mountaineer fame.

We have Armies, Air Bases, and powerful Warships all over the World, but it would be very unsatisfactory with us if a powerful Russian Fleet were to start cruising anywhere near the coast of North or South America.

The Catholics, Baptists, Methodists and other denominations, are apparently trying to extend their beliefs, and ideologies from Greenland's Icy Mountains to India's Coral Strands or around the world and from pole to pole - but they don't like for the Russians to do the same thing.

There is a great deal of evidence and it is being more and more apparent that the Human Race is at present like the Ape and stages by ages of the survival of the fittest and adaption to environment, or by Evolution.

The Wind and the Waves shall obey Thy Will; but hurricanes, floods, droughts, blizzards, earthquakes, forest fires set by lightning etc. have no justification, mercy or pity for any form of life.

When the show-down comes people usually have more faith in other things than Prayer. Billy Graham went to the famous Mayo Clinic for an eye operation and the Missionaries went to the Congo to teach the natives to pray, but when the natives started beating, raping and murdering them they pleaded over their radio for some one to please come and save them. I don't think we should be too uncompromising with the Russians about Religion.

In regard to another delicate subject, perhaps we are on the extreme one way and the Russians are the other. Some say there is a trend to Socialism and Communism in this country.

Not long ago in a National Magazine there were color pictures of street scenes and crowds along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, to my surprise they looked quite as casual as the people one would see on a trip across our own country. Only a few of them showed the Mongolian features and complexion, that I noticed. Instead of us doing things in retaliation for what the Russians do and them for what we do, if our State Department were to argue to the Russian leaders that the white race and kind of people and had better stop fighting and killing each other like the white race has been doing for centuries and leaving the others to work out their own salvation and start fighting for each other in this troubled world, it might lead to more friendly relation between the two Countries and avert a war of annihilation.

WORLD PEACE

The population of America is made up of people from all of the countries of Europe, including many from Germany and Russia. They have united to make a great and progressive nation.

It seems to me the best and most hopeful chances for ending wars and establishing World Peace, and the brotherhood thing to do is for the white people of the world to quit their family fighting and "civil wars" which is what wars between and among them, and while making white men essentially are, and form a united white race and try to align themselves to alien peoples with the better looking and more progressive peoples of Europe, America, and Australia; rather than with the unilimited man-power of Asia, which seems to be the threat to World Peace. And if it is not already too late, take Napoleon's advice and let "sleeping giants" lie.

An African negro that has been educated in American colleges warned that unless the "color bar" were let down, which a great many white people are quite unwilling to do; The negroes of Africa would make with the billion or so people of Asia and overwhelm the white race, and a prominent Asiatic leader implied about the same thing.

Another war with modern weapons of "extermination" might leave the white people of Europe and America so thinned out and weakened, that some other race could, and probably would make prisoners and slaves of the survivors. The Japanese, led to desperation by the defense-less women and children of their own race, when we became engaged in a fight, might become a menace.

World War II so depleted our oil and other natural resources that in any future conflict, rationing of all kinds would be far more drastic than any we have yet experienced. And now that it is over, every ship and every plane that can be spared is being used to explore over-populated Asia, depletes the soil of America and enriches and fertilizes the soil of that country.

There is a story about a kind and well-meaning man that warmed up a cold snake, and when it became sufficiently aroused, it bit and killed him. After having that kind of experience with Japan, and all we had shown and taught her, and the scrap from we so thoughtfully sold to her used against us; we should know that as other backward countries become progressive and ambitious they are pretty sure to want more room and also become militaristic, and a threat to the stability and peace of the world.

P.S. I have come across your original request for an exhibition of the 15 August 64 Highland Park, New Jersey case. My files are gradually getting into order so these 'ancient' cases won't show up such any more. Anyway, the notes I note on it at the time were these:

Possibly saw the two Echoes and a very high jet. Note that reason he says he thought it wasn't the jet was that he saw no other lights with it.

Dear Sir,

On the night of August 15, 1964, at about 8:53 PM I noticed a white color at about 1st magnitude or more blinking at intervals of about every second or so and moving from the bottom of the constellation Pegasus, 5w elevation at about 70° to 75° altitude. Set its sled at a pretty fast speed, faster than ice or satellite I watched till it passed near at my zenith, then as it reached about 60° altitude at a NE direction I spotted it in my telescope, I only could get it in focus for about 25-35 seconds because of its movement.

Through my telescope it was like a white star blinking, was moving so rapidly dimly + moving across the sky. I see wasn't any other lights, with it so reads what made me think it was a airplane or jet. I then after about a minute, time or less it set about 25° NE

Here is the OCR text from the document:

direction because of cloud formation. I
saw a crazy goldish kind of light moving
and very near the planet saturn in the
east before rising, it was about the same
speed of Echo 8 same color.
for Echo( 8.50 PM ) but then after seeing these
two objects, the blinking will light 2. and
crazy goldish light out 9.15 PM same night
I saw the real Echo Hallow satellite from
the west going to the N.E. at exactly
same speed, color & brightness, as it was
due for my last 10 revolutions in the
past month.

I thank you
sincerely,

P.S. I am enclosing a map
of which I spotted the
object. it would appreciate
it if you would tell
me, if you find out what
the objects in say what.
