Dear Sirs,

On Friday, the 8th of this month at about 5:15PM over Manhattan I saw some kind of flying object which didn't appear to be a plane, blip, etc. It was a fairly large, silverish oval object. It flew very fast and below the cloud cover. Could your department confirm the sighting? Could you also send me some information about past UFO sightings.

Thank you very much.
Respectfully,

[Signature area is blacked out]
