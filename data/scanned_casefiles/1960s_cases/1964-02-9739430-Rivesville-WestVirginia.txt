8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
West

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object dimmer than a bright star in flight which included rising. Red on core, blue tail, white center. Had trail tail. Speed estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 mph. Moving very fast. Object supposedly stopped in mid flight. Slow was about 5 seconds.

11. COMMENTS
Much conflicting information. Maj Mills considers the possibility of a WX balloon. Description of this stop and duration indicates a meteor. Speeds consistent with this analysis. Case carried as other (Conflicting Data). Either speed or duration in error.

In the case of 9 February there was other conflicting data, could I also have the name of the observer. I think that the atmospheric optics could play a factor or we could have looked out, one of us, and saw some interesting atmospheric optics to boot. That was the one in Fayettv. W.Va. east, West Virginia.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Other: Conflicting Data
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDFCG/Major George Mills/57223/jh
SUBJECT: Evaluation of Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon

TO: TDEV (Capt. Quintanilla)

1. Reference your request of 30 March 1964 to evaluate, with respect to meteorological phenomena, a sighting of 9 February 1964 between 2000 and 2100 local near Rivesville, W. Va.

2. There were no unusual meteorological phenomena observed at forecast for that area. However, the possibility of a sighting of a radiosonde balloon was considered. The routine radiosonde release from Huntington, W. Va. for 10 February 1964 at 0000Z was subjected to winds from the southwest, 250Â° (as measured clockwise from north), with speeds between 30 and 58 knots. A vector analysis which accounts for the effect of all the various directions and speeds on the balloon train indicates it could have been in the vicinity of Rivesville, W. Va. at the time of the sightings.

3. However, the usual radiosonde balloon rise rate is 1000 feet per minute which by the time of the sighting would place the balloon well above the elevation where most of these balloons break. If the balloon developed a defect or a slow leak at some high elevation it could conceivably remain below the altitude where a large break would quickly remove it from the sky. IF this was the case on the evening of 9 February, the sighting was possibly the radiosonde balloon from Huntington.

4. There is some other support for this hypothesis. The Huntington wind reports below 30,000 feet showed the deviations in direction and speed of a typical wind distribution pattern. But above this level and velocity were reported as a constant 58 knots from 250 degrees. This is not a normal flow pattern and suggests that the balloon was no longer rising.

Dear Sirs,

I write you this letter to let you know that I have seen what I think to be a flying saucer. I have seen it mostly on clear nights. It comes from the East but goes to the West. Every time I have seen it (which is about three times) it was between 8:00 & 9:00 o'clock standard time. It is reddish blue-green with a white center. Every time it seems to stop in mid-air and it shines away brightly. It goes around in about two circles. And then the light went onto it & it vanished into no-where. I told a few of my friends & they said that I was a crack-pot & that I was just crazy & some even said that I was a

Dear [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of February 20, 1964, in which you reported seeing, on several occasions, an unusual object in the sky over Rivesville.

Enclosed is an Air Force Technical Information Questionnaire. It is requested that you complete all the questions, answer them as fully as you can, and return the form to this Headquarters for a possible evaluation.

Unidentified Flying Objects have been reported by many people, including scientists and professional individuals, pilots, both military and commercial aircraft have made unusual sightings during flights and astronomers see phenomena in the sky which they cannot explain. This does not mean these sightings represent extraterrestrial spacecraft under intelligent control. On the contrary, Air Force investigations have proved almost conclusively that, given enough information, there is a logical explanation for all aerial phenomena.

Weather and atmospheric conditions are responsible for a great many UFO reports. Reflections on clouds from lights on the ground sometimes give an unusual appearance. Mitrages have been reported as UFOs as have flights of birds over an area where the lights from below were reflected on the air overhead, causing them to give a most unusual appearance. Aircraft flying at exceptionally high altitude or very clear nights have caused many people to report an unidentified flying object because the lights in and around the aircraft look together in a very unusual light as they fly overhead. This is also true of balloons. And, of course, satellites are often mistaken for unusual objects. Lastly, not infrequently, are those and photographic accounts for many reports, especially by pilots, since the sight of this phenomenon seen from the sky, is quite awe-inspiring and sometimes even frightening.

Enclosed is the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on this subject which will help to explain the Air Force program on Unidentified Flying Objects. Included in the Fact Sheet is a bibliography of books on the subject which may be of particular interest to you.

Thank you for reporting this sighting to the Air Force.
