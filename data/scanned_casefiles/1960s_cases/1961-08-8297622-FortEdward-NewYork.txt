Round obj white, dull with some characteristics. Speed faster than jet. Got radius 1/2 mi in diameter. Speed involved with distance, 1st sighting 20-25 min; 2nd 15 min. Random movements facing to E.

11. COMMENTS
Due to release of weather and witness in area & approx. time of sightings and witness their reference to similarity to balloon course, with similar flight characteristics of balloons it is probable that sightings were balloons.

CONDITIONS ON BOTH SIGHTINGS AT ALL ALTITUDES WERE SIMILIAR.
A JET STREAM LOCATED IN THE AREA, BUT WAS NOT OF VERY HIGH
VELOCITY. VERY POSSIBLE THAT OBJECTS SIGHTED WERE WEATHER
BALLOONS AT EXTREMELY HIGH ALTITUDE IN THAT OBSERVER
COMMENTED ON SIMILARITY OF OBJECT TO WEATHER BALLOON. AL-
THOUGH NOT SUBSTANTIATED BY WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY
GIVEN BY WEATHER BUREAU, A WIND SHIFT OF HIGH VELOCITY AT
HIGH ALTITUDE COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR CHANGE IN DIRECTION
AND HIGH RATE OF TRAVEL. PAR 15L, NONE.
