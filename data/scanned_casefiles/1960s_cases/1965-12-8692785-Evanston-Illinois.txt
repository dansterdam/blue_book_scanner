The text in the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10973 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7 Dec 65 / 22372
2. LOCATION: Evanston, Illinois
3. SOURCES: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. COURSE: West
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Object closed 1 aircraft landing light. It was in sight for three minutes and disappeared behind trees. Sky was hazy. Object was bright while with an orange- white light like a tail going on and off. The object looked like an aircraft but the sky was full of haze. Due to the hazy condition of the atmosphere it is unlikely that the object was a satellite. The object was probably an aircraft. The haze obscured through vision and the observer may have the misappearance that he describes.
12. WITNESS: 1 Witness

Sky was full of flashes, I don't see very well at night. I couldn't read details. I have missed seeing it, I guess. Out of curiosity, I'll appreciate a brief note concerning your conclusion on my "speak."

Gentlemen:

On Sep/23 last Dec.7,I saw a star-like object which moved almost exactly westward along over DEPAUL univ. and took a trajectory similar to that taken by a meteorite from here.It moved from higher elevation to lower as it went off and on the sky appeared to be distorted or not clear as it appeared to be on one side only.

I realize you can't answer all things,but if you have a moment,I'd appreciate knowing if my "UFO" was simply an unusual asteroid or a satellite whose motion estimate "gascock".

Thanks

The image on this page appears to be a sketch that includes a compass rose and instructions for the observer. However, there is no photograph present on this page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass where you last saw the object.
