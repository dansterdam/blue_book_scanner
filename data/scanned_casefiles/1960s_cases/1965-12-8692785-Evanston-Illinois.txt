PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7 Dec 65 7/2357Z

2. LOCATION: Evanston, Illinois

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: West

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object looked like a distant aircraft landing light. It was in night for three minutes and disappeared behind trees. Sky was hazy. Object was bright white with an orange spark like tail going on and off. Object looked like a satellite to the observer. Observer stated that the sky was full of planes.

Due to the hazy condition of the atmosphere it is unlikely that the object was a satellite. Object was probably an aircraft. The white and red flashing lights observed through the haze would have the same appearance that the observer describes.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    7   April   1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Sky was full of planes. I don't see how at least half a dozen pilots and somebody at O'Hare could have missed seeing it.

Out of curiosity, I'd appreciate a brief note concerning your conclusions on my "spook."

Gentlemen:

At 6:57 PK last Dec.7,I saw a star-like object passing almost exactly westbound along over Dempster St., low in the western sky from here. It moved in a trajectory similar to that of an ordinary artificial satellite, but entered a fan-shaped tail of what appeared to be a orange sparks,which went off and on, and sometimes appeared only on one side.

I realize you can't answer all these sightings, but if you have a moment, I'd appreciate knowing if my UFO was simply the second stage of a sputnik or Atlas, etc., or a legitimate "spook".

Thanks

b. Color: Bright white with orange tail

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
All of body. About half of tail at largest.

Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[There are 5 small sketches with arrows]

Sample sequence:
Spark-like orange tail went off (3) and on (1,4), occasionally appearing one side only (2,5). Entire sighting nearly straight west, moving away and toward horizon.

An artificial satellite jetting or orange tail. Friends suggest it was an old second stage "skimming" the atmosphere and heating up. But the tail was symmetric and several times appeared on one side only.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high this object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Handwritten notes:
Near tree -> A
6 buildings -> B
Trees along Dempster St. -> 
(My position changed 1/2 block)

Slightly to curve in first saw it. Not sure. Then almost straight west.

Tried everybody but Kremlin. Got drawer-full of pictures of astronauts. Even wrote Dr. Hynek. Only this responded intelligently.
