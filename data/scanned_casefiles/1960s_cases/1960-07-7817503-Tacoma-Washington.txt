k. Position Title and Comments of Preparing Officer.
   The manner in which the object hovered and moved slowly, combined with
   the instantaneous disappearance, would indicate that it might be a balloon
   which eventually burst at high altitude. However, the Weather Bureau reported
   no balloons in the area, and stated that their balloons carry a white light,
   which burns only 15 minutes. Refractions from the atmosphere might make a
   white light appear red to a ground observer.

l. Physical Evidence - None.

THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE ST. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRAT, FRIDAY, 22 JULY 1960, PAGE 3A.

                        " 2 COUNTY GROUPS
                     SEE STRANGE RED
                     LIGHTS IN SKY

Two separate groups of St. Louis County residents, about three-quarters of a mile from each other, said they saw bright red lights in a circular formation in the sky about 10 p.m. Wednesday.

The _______ family, _______ University City, observed the mysterious lights through a 120-power telescope.

Mrs. _______ and her two young sons watched the object through her nephew's powerful Navy binoculars.

Dozens of persons reported seeing a mysterious red light or lights in the sky above St. Louis County about 9:30 or 10 p.m. Wednesday. Many other reported flickering, erratically-moving red lights in the sky about the same time Tuesday night.

Mrs. _______ said she and her companions watched the object for 15 or 20 minutes before the lights seemed to rise and then disappeared suddenly.

"It looked like a wheel," she said. "There was a double row of lights in a circle, and it had spokes, also lighted. We sighted it when we were in a car near our home. When we pulled up, it seemed to be right overhead, and I heard a muffled humming, which later faded out."

Mrs. _______ said she ran and got her husband's binoculars. Then the group watched the lights as they moved steadily west, zig-zagging slightly, and later started to rise.

"What seemed to be a flickering of the lights to the naked eye was really a movement of the lights, we found when we looked through the binoculars," she said.

"It must have been terribly high when it disappeared, because it looked like a star just before it vanished."

Mr. _______, 14, whose hobby is astronomy, described the object as "four very bright red objects, in a circle around a central point at about 20 revolutions per minute."

The lights appeared to be one light to the naked eye, he said. They moved from east-northeast to west-southwest "at about the speed of a slow airplane." He said.

He said he could not tell how high or how far away the lights were. They disappeared "one by one, seeming to merge into each other" he said.

_______, his brother _______, 12, their parents and two neighbors observed the object through telescopes, until the last light west generally straight up, taking a slightly erratic course.

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative text on A Form 172):
A telephone call was received from Mr. [redacted] by the Base Clearance Officer the night of 19 July 1960, reporting an unidentified flying object. A number of 19 major news wire services have been seen reporting the object. This information was immediately followed by a telephone call from Mrs. [redacted], University City, St. Louis, Missouri, providing the same type of information. This headquarters contacted Det 6, 10th Radar Bomb Scoring Squadron and the 798th AC&W RBS did not become active until 2200, 19 July, one half hour after the time of the reported sighting. Det 6, 10th RBS was contacted at 0830 local, 21 July and reported one aircraft at approx 1,000 ft at tracking East to West over North St. Louis at 2150 local, 20 July. The 798th AC&W Sq log was negative.

The U.S. Weather Bureau, St. Louis, Missouri, stated no balloons were in the vicinity at the time of the reported sighting. Many other persons have been quoted by the press and radio in the St. Louis area as having seen the object both nights. This headquarters is unable to determine the nature of the object, and is forwarding this information IAW paragraph 1.3b, AFR 200-2. Also inclosed is an extract from a local newspaper which gives an account of the incident and names and addresses of additional observers.
