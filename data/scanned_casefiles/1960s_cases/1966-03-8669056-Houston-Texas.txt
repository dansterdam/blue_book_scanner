It was about 1:30 at night, we on my wife were in bed talking, all of a sudden we heard a noise coming from above over our apt. The time approx. The object stops, I got at our window, flashed in bright daylight, was though it was hovering. There nothing a appearing near and giving off so lot of smoke. Now I was down stairs to get a water hock, but wasn't out there it was gone from sight. The light appeared but the object was full of smoke. In a few minutes the smoke cleared up.

SUBJECT: FLYING OBJECT
FROM: Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]

1. Mr. [redacted] stated he was hesitant to tell anyone about what he saw and heard until he read in the paper about the flying objects as reportedly seen by a group of people in Michigan last week.

2. "We were laying back on the bed watching the late show about 1 a.m. We heard this noise coming from above. The brightness of the lights lit up the whole apartment so fast. Nothing struck our apartment, but object continued to hover just above our window. The flashing lights were white and smoky, lots of smoke I would say. Not a howl, more like a yen, yen. A different repeating sound from whirling helicopter, and all the time just above our window. It was blinking the brightest lights, white smoky color. My wife and I both jumped up to look out. So much smoke all around object and flashing lights. I pulled on my pants and when I got down the steps the outside air was still full of smoke. Object seemed to have gone straight up. Would guess the object was about five feet across and enveloped in smoke. No one else in the apartment saw or heard the object."

Case 1 Mar
1966

TDET/Maj H Quintanilla, Jr/T0916/mhs/2 Nov 66
Analysis of Australian UFO Photographs

Hq USAF (SAFDICC)

1. Photo analysis has been accomplished on the attached photographs.
A positive identification or description of the UFO is not possible
with the photographic information available and without the original
negatives. However, there are several comments which may prove
relevant to the analysis.

a. The image does not appear to be the result of any processing
effect.

b. It appears that the shutter speed used was considerably longer
than the stated 1/2 second. The distance covered by the vehicles during
the time of exposure, as indicated by their light tracks, is much too
high to have occurred in 1/2 second. In fact, a speed far in excess of
100 mph would be indicated by a 1/2 second exposure time. Speed calculations for the vehicles were made using an average distance of 60 feet
between light poles. Had more exposure been available and had the
image been more clearly defined, a broad approximation of rate of movement could probably have been derived.

c. It is noted that there is no reflection of the bright image
on the water although it was stated to be only 20 feet above the water. The reflection of the street 14 lights are quite evident. It is possible
that some obstruction in the foreground could have blocked the view of
a reflection from the image.

d. No measurements are possible due to the halation of the bright
image.

2. Since there is no indication of threat to the security of the
United States, it is felt that additional investigation into these
photographs of alleged UFOs is not in the best interest of Department
of Defense funds. Therefore, no further attempt will be made to
evaluate the cause of the image on the attached photographs.

I saw a picture of it (maybe) and should it to my dad. The next day it was on the news. I so must have seen it, or else I couldn't draw a picture of it. I saw draw it before it was on the news and decided it. I think you doing a great job investigating, and I have your being pressed for information, in fact your given best. As much as you can't but I appreciate it if you could send a letter or something. By the way, what do you think of a group called C.O.A.P. (Chicago Observers of Air Phenomena) that one and my boy friend. Our aim is to get proof of U.F.O.'s and we try to start greatly sending in the prank letters.

The text on the page appears to be handwritten and partially illegible. Here's what I can discern:

Top left of page: A large black checkmark/tick mark

First line: "Ft" (possibly "File")

Subsequent lines contain fragments of text, but many words are difficult to read with complete certainty. Some words I can partially make out include:
- "...was supplied with..."
- "...mile of..."
- "...give..."

The handwriting is cursive and somewhat faint, making full transcription challenging. Large portions of the text are not clearly legible.

At the top right corner, there is also a handwritten note: 7-8m 11h66

At the bottom right corner, there is another handwritten note: CM-58

The rest of the document appears to be mostly blank or the text is too illegible for me to confidently transcribe.

Official Report By
Cadet Patrick O. Myers
Civil Air Patrol
Squadron 602
Fremont Ohio

March 8 1966

Dear Sir:

A large U.F.O. has been sighted near Clyde Ohio. Many people have seen it. Please send me about 25 forms like you sent me to fill out for record, so that these people can fill them out for us.

The object which I also saw was about 30 times the size of the moon. A bright red, looked like a fire in a silo from far away. Moved from west to east, and than east to west. The radio reported that the object was seen in Ohio too.

Also send postage paid envelopes for the reports, as the C.A.F. does not get such envelopes.
Here is enclosed report by our local news paper.

Space Objects
Seen At Clyde

CLYDE - Were visitors from outer space circling Clyde for a landing Monday night? Strange as it may seem an unidentified flying object was spotted on two sides of the village shortly before 5 p.m.

The "huge red ball" was spotted by an unidentified resident of Route 191 north and by a Race street woman. Village police received two calls.

Thinking the first was a hoax, they didn't get the name of the excited woman from Route 101, before she hung up. The second came from James Mason, Race street, who reported his wife had seen a similar object between 7:35 and 7:45 p.m.

The woman from Route 101 reported the "Huge red ball" north of Clyde and traveling.

Thank You;

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

Space Objects
Seen At Clyde

CLYDE - Were visitors from outer space circling Clyde for a brief time Monday night? Strangely as it may seem an unidentified flying object was spotted on two sides of the village shortly before 8 p.m.

The huge red ball was spotted by an unidentified resident of the village and by a Race street woman. Village police received two calls.

Thinking the first was a hoax, they didn't get the name of the excited woman from Route 101, before she hung up. The second call came from James Mason, Race street, who reported his wife had seen a similar object between 7:15 and 7:45 p.m.

The woman from Route 101 reported the "huge red ball" north of Clyde and traveling west. Mrs. Mason said she saw the object skimming over the tops of buildings south of Clyde, traveling east. She said it was just beyond the high school as it passed.

Mrs. Mason compared the size of the strange object to the village water tank. "It was red and it was huge," noted Mrs. Mason. She spotted the object when she let her eyes follow what looked like a falling star and suddenly there was the red ball. Mrs. Mason attempted to keep the moving object in sight as it traveled.

Both women repeatedly stated the red ball just disappeared.

Thank you;

Sincerely,

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

During the past year I had a habit
have that an nightly watch out for ufos
I feel that I am capable of distinguishing moving stars or satellites from U.F.Os. I
could say that the signs I began primarily and because of my interest am still pursuing. Moreover, I would not wish
to give time and my time making up
false stories.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? I felt that if other young
thoughts I saw a U.F.O.
that they would think I was crazy or
just do nothing for publicity to hospital telling family.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 August 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Tuesday March 15, 1966. Time 1:00 am. W.A.O. started out from two solar points appearing in a red glow. Using the match head test as mentioned in the previous question, it was considerably smaller. The U.F.O. streaked as sudden standstill.

March 26, 1966: Time 9:00 and 10:00 P.M.
During this particular night I have seen five different objects. They appeared at different time intervals. It is quite possible that it was the same one circling around.

From Australia to Michigan, a flurry of eerie UFO sightings

Call them what you will: flying saucers, Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), optical illusions, or the first symptoms of the silly season. They are back again--and seen by more people than ever before. Some are greenish and iridescent, like the mystery thing that swooped down over Perth, Australia several weeks ago (left and below). Others are football-shaped and aglow with pulsating lights. Last week the mani-

He said that he and several other boys, not in Staples, were sending up balloons with flares attached. He said that I should speak to William Ryan of Yankee Hill Rd., Westport as he was the head of this group of boys. At 3:30 PM I spoke to [redacted], age 19 at his home at 5 Yankee Hill along with his mother. He said that he [redacted] and [redacted] had been buying surplus weather balloons in NYC and filling them with hydrogen gas and attaching a flare with a 24 minute fuse and sending them aloft during the evenings. He had one unused one in his cellar which he gave to me. They were paying $1.50 apiece for them. The flares were purchased at Barkers market. The Conn. Gas Co. in Bpt. The original balloon sent up was just an experiment but when they saw results, they decided to keep sending them up. They were told to stop sending these up and told that a warrant may be issued for them.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

The photos enclosed belong to Life and were lent to one of our people by one of theirs as a personal favor with this stipulation - we must return them quickly.

At the same time, we are still committed to Congress to analyze these photos.

Would you make copies, return the originals (which are really copies of the originals) as quickly as possible, and use your copies for your analysis.

Hopefully, Klass's theories, publicized lately, can explain these photos?

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On hours after the sighting, a second object was seen (of the same shape) going from West to North-east. It traveled at a high rate of speed and suddenly disappeared. The object seen in the summer of 1966 in Tarara Beach, Cuba was of the same shape. That time we saw it clearly. It was about 100 feet off the sea and stopped in the air also. This object was about 200 yards away from the house and came closer until it passed over us, no more than 80 feet above us. No sound was heard but a slow whistle or whine and nothing could be seen except a bright ball of light. The rays of light which looked like wishers moved from side to side all the time, and sometimes cross-crossing each other. My mother and aunt were witnesses.
