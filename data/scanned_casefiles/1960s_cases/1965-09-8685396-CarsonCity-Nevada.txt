Knock-out Blow at Felixstowe

[UNDER the heading "UNDER THE HEADING KNOCK-OUT BLOW AT FELIXSTOWE" there is a lengthy text describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object. The text discusses the sighting by a driver and his passenger, and their experience of the object hovering above their car and causing a temporary blackout or knockout effect.]

There was a high-pitched humming noise, and the entire car seemed to have stilled and collapsed. This was described in the opening paragraph. The text then goes on to describe the location near where Paul Green (as mentioned in a previous article) had also encountered an unidentified flying object. The report states that Dr. Finch, a professional investigator, looked into the case. It also mentions the 25-year-old driver of the car in which the incident occurred. The text then describes the timing of the incident around 10:30 p.m. and the reactions of the witnesses. The report concludes by stating that the author himself wondered where the car window to see the object was pointing, and he looked but could not determine the car window's orientation relative to the object.

The text from the document is as follows:

At 8:40 PM on July 31, 1965 a Washoe County, Nevada police officer reported an unidentified flying object NE of Carson City. Simultaneous radar fixes were obtained by Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, and Cannon AFB, Clovis, New Mexico. The officer observed the object with his binoculars for approximately 10 minutes and observed its movements: it hovered, moved up and down and laterally, then accelerated and disappeared from sight more than a mile away. As "intelligent control" was indicated during the first 10 minutes of observation when the object remained stationary, the estimated size of the object was confirmed by radar to be 10,000 ft., observed at 3,000 ft. The object remained stationary for several minutes and abruptly lost appearance when it accelerated to approximately 1000-1500 ft and returned to the original location. At which time the object moved to the east for approximately 10,000-15,000 ft and disappeared. The night sky was clear and many stars were visible. The object appeared to be about three times the size of the evening star. The UFO was estimated to be more than a mile NE of Officer **** and appeared as a "light" source. The object itself was white with a blue-green center, with a red rotating light circling the center (blinking 3-4 times per second). At approximately 1:15 Officer **** drove across town and again observed the object at approximately 1:30 AM. The object now hovering was same color and rotating light, commanded to change colors, and shape and fade out. Both Tinker AFB and Cannon AFB tracked the object to a point 15 miles southwest of Carson City, Nevada. A few minutes later, it was tracked on radar for a distance of 250 miles south of Tinker when it was lost again. A "brighter" silhouette was also noted.

The image appears to contain diagrams and drawings rather than any photographs. 

Drawing A shows a diagram with labeled distances, indicating that the object was sighted at an altitude of 1,000-1,500 feet and was approximately 3,000 feet away from the observer.

Drawing B shows a diagram with a red rotating light and the colors blue-green and white.

Drawing C shows a map-like diagram with locations labeled such as "Oklahoma City", "Midwest City", "Tinker AFB", "Norman", and "Wynnewood".

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

in the vicinity of Wynnewood at 8,000 ft was notified but the
airline pilot said no visual contact with the object was made.
Officer A and a Ms. mother, Mrs. also watched the ob-

ALLEGED INVESTICATIONS

I first learned of the Wynnewood sighting at 9:00 when a police captain told me he had observed an unidentified object going southwest. Within an hour I arrived at the Wynnewood Police Station and talked with the chief of police who showed me the first information he had received from a C.P.O. and reported it to be "strange". I called Mr. Pryor, another of the officers who stated that they had no previous knowledge that anyone in town had observed any unidentified object. Police suggested that we go over the case in detail. When a reported from Ada, Oklahoma was talking to his wife and child and stated he could not be disturbed. I told them that I had the official report on this case and after you give us any information you may have, I was permitted to enter the home and talked about 10 times. They had observed something in the sky and Tulsa. While I was there a reported from the Sunday Oklahoma City, when said to Oklahoma City stated he had been there and I talked with him. He asked me to call him as soon as a returned to Oklahoma City when I could enter the case in detail. He did not want to return to work (works the night shift - could have) informing. He has been with the for about 3 years. He believed the object to be a aircraft. He has served in the Army and knows what the objects were and to report all objects that they observe. But not much about the UFO if it in general. At first he would not talk but after I told him I have the official and Army report on this case and after you give us any information you may have. I was permitted to enter the home and talked about 10 times. They had observed something in the sky and Tulsa. While I was there a reported from the Sunday Oklahoma City, when said to Oklahoma City stated he had been there and I talked with him. He asked me to call him as soon as a returned to Oklahoma City when I could enter the case in detail. He did not want to return to work (works the night shift - could have) informing. He has been with the for about 3 years. He believed the object to be a aircraft. He has served in the Army and knows what the objects were and to report all objects that they observe.

Oklahoma City IICUPO August 16 2
Information received from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol at the CHIP
lower Oklahoma City.

At 6455 p.m. the GHP tower received in the neighborhood of 35- 
20 visual sightings were made by police and highway patrol troopers
of various colors flying through the area. These passed over the Norman Area. to 
Chandler and back South through Meaker and Shawnee. (all in Oklahoma)
Three Civilian officers stated that they saw four of the objects in 
sight at this time. Also another has a dropped up from the South 
on a course apparently close to fly directly over Shawnee.
The sightings vary from one to four objects, blinking, flashing, in 
a reddish color and varying in speed, and blue lights brighter. Shawnee
reports the object seem to be flying in a diamond type formation. 
During the period the two larger objects were observed by the South east
Cushing and two the West flying in a Southerly direction. GHP
stated one light was at Davenport and two at Chandler also reported 
11 miles West od Davenport on US 66 watched an object which was
described as rotating on a horizontal bottom and where on top were for
15 minutes and move off to the West. Closest APB is 20 - 25 radar
and they advise they are attempting to have approximate 12,000 feet
which seems to coincide with the visual sightings. All very high.

NO CASE:
25-6R-1965

(continued from page 4)

This is as much as I can tell you at the present time concerning the case. Several interesting points emerge from this report. First, the witnesses apparently saw something which they could not identify as a known aircraft, and it displayed some unusual features. The fact that the object was seen by two persons at the same time, with their descriptions generally agreeing, lends some credence to the report. However, the variation in their estimates of the object's size and distance from their location, as well as the fact that no photographs were taken, make it impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion concerning the nature and identity of the object. The fact that it was seen for only a short period of time, and that the witnesses were not close to it, weakens the case somewhat from the standpoint of obtaining conclusive data. Overall, this report, while of interest, does not provide enough information to warrant a firm judgment as to the identification or origin of the object.

Mr. Jesse Upchurch of Marshall Oklahoma called and advised that from 9:30 p.m. 9-8-65 he hit his windshield observed a radish ball of fire turn to blue than to white, traveling in a westerly direction across a partially cloudy sky. Appeared as a very large house. RAYMON REXRODE about 5 miles east of St. Hill which was red and blue and silver in color traveling north about 25,000 ft. Moved too fast to pick it up on radar. Time Approx: 9:30 p.m. The residents of the QUICK AIRPORT JUNCTION reported a strange object with fire coming from the rear, was very high and traveling east in a straight line. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. H.C. Neil (newspaper Edmund Oklahoma) and Joe Cobb Edmund police officers were at the bridge over Spunk Creek about 5 miles East of Wellston and saw a UFO that was very high and "doing maneuvers". The two UFOs were red-white and orangey white red in color. One was about 50 miles South of Lindsay at 10,000 feet has been blinking lights in the middle skyway and one about 30 miles North over 75 at very fast rate of speed. Sub.

25 minute conference called with them, IFOUSO (no) and NICAP headquarters, Washignton, D.C. They had some radio and telephone communication in and and took a 25 minute interview for some newspaper. I was up at 2:00 and received a call indicating that they were reporters and interviewing me. At 7:30 in the evening Radio and TV station KYI had a senior officer. NICAPLS wanted a complete rundown by telephone. We sighted many airplanes but no UFOs. Many of the calls we received reported captures of UFOs. Some we could definitely identify as airplanes. Over 2,000 persons were there. That was the largest group we have had this year, it was over 5,000 persons. The 6:30 home by 11:15 we did have two four inch telescopes. The reports we received are not complete. The recovered fragments were received Sunday night from a boy who had received some toy from Texas. A 1970 red and white Ford rammed a 1970 car, The boy who was driving the other car, we could not determine what he found. We have been unable to locate the boy. There is nothing in the story but that I am sending them. We have a lab in Oklahoma City working on it now. The results of the documents are radioactive and highly reactive. (As you can tell) They are only evidence that they are there, send you what the lab hear says. Working on two good leads. If they are there, these may prove your interest.

Dear Sgt. Moore:

Thank you very much for your assistance concerning the recent UFO activity in Oklahoma. Your explanations certainly helped clarify my understanding of how the Air Force handles the UFO program.

As you will note in the attached letter, I simply advised the NICAP that no FAA radar tracked UFOs on the date and location referred to in their letter.

Thanks again for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Hall:

Your recent letter addressed to the Federal Aviation Agency's Public Relations Office in Washington has been referred to this office for response. This office was inadvertently placed with other material to be evaluated, and your request has apparently gone unnoticed for this reason.

The article enclosed with your letter from the St. Louis POST-DISPATCH, reported a recent weekend sighting of an unidentified flying object. I indicate that no UFOs were tracked by Federal Aviation Agency radar on the date and at the location mentioned in your letter.

The news article from the St. Louis POST-DISPATCH is returned.

Sincerely yours,

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED OVER CALIFORNIA
CORONA CITY, CALIF., July 31 - A bright, round, reddish-orange object was reported to have been sighted over Corona City on July 22. The object was described as being about 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and it was said to have moved at a fast rate of speed. The object was first sighted at about 10:30 p.m. and was visible for about 5 minutes before it disappeared from view. Several persons reported seeing the object, and their descriptions of it were said to be consistent.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
JAN-FEB 66

20 Sep 65
Selsey, England

A Selsey, England, fisherman who wishes to remain anonymous, reported seeing a strange, saucer-shaped object off the coast on September 20.
He said he was out fishing with several others when he noticed a bright, brilliant light in the sky shortly after 9 p.m. The light, he said, was moving across the sky in a northerly direction and gradually became larger and more distinct. 
It was very close, only about 200 yards off the coast, and appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter. The saucer-shaped object had a dome in the center and was a metallic silver color.
The had was immediately behind the object as it passed over the fishermen, but they did not hear any sound from it. 
As it moved away, the light gradually diminished and the object appeared to be glowing. There was no flame or exhaust visible.
The witness said the sighting lasted about 10 minutes. He was greatly interested and excited, he said, and could not account for what he saw.
"I was absolutely amazed," he told investigators. "I thought at first it must be some kind of aircraft, but it was completely silent and moved in a way that no aircraft I have ever seen could move. It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter."
Several other local fishermen who were out at the same time also reportedly saw the strange object.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Enjoyed our telephone conversations - have the indicated information on the case which we feel will be of interest. The investigation is involved and we feel certain conclusions can be made based on our thorough check of the facts.

I shall send you the Oklahoma Highway Patrol Log of what was reported and give most of the information but not all - for additional information I would suggest you check the files of the various news media in the Oklahoma City area.

I am inclosing to you a clipping from a recent mail from a our member giving data and observations. St. Petersburg July 27 on the same object.

We investigated a report of the OKLAHOMA CITY incident, it concerns a display of lights over the city, which the newspaper editor claimed would "send you to the YORK YOKE". I will send you the report. Should it be mailed this is the week-end as I plan to be from office.

Will keep you posted. Please let me know any thing you can do about getting the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and police observations. NOT the press.

It is my opinion that many of the sightings in 1965 were misidentified or hoaxed. HOWEVER NOTALL CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY.

(Very truly yours,)

The image contains a newspaper article titled "Midwesterners Tell Of Mystery Objects" from the Raleigh Times dated Wednesday, August 4, 1965. The article discusses several sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) reported by people in the Midwest region of the United States during the months of August and September. The article mentions that the objects were described as being star-like or planet-like in appearance, and that some were seen moving at high speeds. The article also notes that some of the sightings were reported to the Air Force.

Text from the document:

MIDWESTERNERS TELL OF MYSTERY OBJECTS

OKLAHOMA CITY (UPI) - Unidentified flying objects have been sighted in the skies over the Midwest in the past month, according to reports received by Air Force investigators.

The objects, described as star-like or planet-like in appearance, have been spotted in Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and as far east as Indiana, the reports said.

The Air Force said it was investigating the sightings, which began in early August and continued into September.

One witness, D.L. Biddle, an Oklahoma City man, reported seeing an object with blinking lights pass over his house last August 1. He said the object was traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound.

Another witness, W.H. Bost of Oklahoma City, said he saw a similar object hovering over his home on August 9. Bost said the object suddenly shot up into the sky at a high speed.

Reports of the sightings have come from all over the Midwest. In Kansas City, Mo., a number of persons reported seeing a shiny, flashing object in the sky on August 19. Some said the object appeared to land briefly on the ground and then take off again.

In Ashland, Kan., Woodward Sand said he saw three shiny, disk-like objects in the sky on August 23.

In Hays, Kan., a university professor, who asked that his name not be used, said he and some of his students saw a circular object with flashing lights hovering over a highway on August 24. The object was visible for several minutes, the witness said, before it shot upward at a high speed.

There have been numerous other reports of UFO sightings in the Midwest during August and September, the Air Force said. Most of the objects people reported seeing were described as star-like or planet-like in appearance, and some were seen to move at high speeds.

The Air Force said it was investigating the sightings to determine if they could be explained as conventional objects.

CARSON CITY, NEVADA. REPORT 12

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
Mr. Frank Howell, 1002 1/2 North Nevada Street, Carson City, Nevada reported that on September 8, 1965 at approximately 6:30 p.m. he and his wife observed three round, silvery objects in the sky over Carson City. The objects were seen at about 35 degrees above the western horizon and were moving in an irregular pattern at a moderate speed. They disappeared behind a cloud and were not seen again. Mr. Howell stated that the objects were approximately the size of a half dollar held at arm's length and made no sound.

INVESTIGATION:
An on-site investigation was conducted by Major William Shaw, USAF. He interviewed Mr. Howell and viewed the area where the sightings occurred. The sky was clear and there was no evidence of aircraft, missiles, satellites or other objects in the sky at the time of the sighting. No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the investigation, the sighting remains unidentified. There is insufficient information to determine the nature of the objects observed.

REPORT SUBMITTED BY: ROBERT BLAIR
LOCATION: CARSON CITY, NEVADA
DATE: SEPTEMBER 8, 1965
TIME: 2230 HOURS

On the evening of September 8, 1965, at approximately 2230 hours, Robert Blair, an employee of the Nevada State Highway Department, was driving home from work on U.S. Highway 50 west of Carson City, Nevada.

While driving, Blair observed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be descending rapidly. He stopped his vehicle and watched as the light hovered above a nearby ranch house for a few minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing.

Blair returned to the area the next day and spoke with the ranch owner, who confirmed seeing the strange light the previous evening. The ranch owner stated that the light had shone brightly through the windows of the house before quickly departing.

Blair submitted a detailed report of the incident to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official investigation of unidentified flying objects. This report is part of the Project Blue Book archives.

The sheriff's office in Cleveland, Tennessee, said lights were seen on Saturday evening scattered over the county and were investigated by deputies. The object gave off a great deal of light, about the size of a basketball when seen, and moved in an erratic manner. The incident was similar to one reported northward on the same night.

We told them the five or six cases we have been working on (meaning we have not found anything to prove they are "flying saucers"), Certainly we were most interested in the investigation because of the public curiosity, but we cannot make a statement beyond what the facts justify. Dr. Adkinson's real estate investigation is not finished. His findings will be made public, after completion, in a factual report.
Tony Zeto, 38, named by the Oklahoma City Planning Commission as chairman to study the UFO problem, said, "It was our understanding that this group was to proceed under simul taneous instructions from the Air Force." He said there were procedures under sim ilar official investigations.

(Continued From Page 9)
Did a jet or other aircraft leave sudden marks on the ground near Oklahoma City? According to published reports, some marks were found.
After an investigation as long as since May, here's what the Air Force had to say about that:
"Just for a strange feeling over here - not much else. We don't know what caused the marks." The Air Force closed the case.
If the marks were made by a jet aircraft, that would not have been unusual or outstanding. Jet aircraft do occasionally leave marks on the ground, but the Air Force found nothing of significance there.
What is significant is that the public would be informed and reassured by any factual statement from the Air Force whenever the public interest is aroused by newspaper or other media publicity. It seemed like a long time for the Air Force to determine "not much else" as the final conclusion in this case.
It logged like a "dead-end" from the public viewpoint, even though it may have been a routine and proper Air Force procedure.
The opinion declared that the Underwood investigation would not be made on the basis of an assessment prejudiced against the Air Force. The committee wanted facts for the public, not opinions. It was determined that Underwood would not be assessed against the city.

MAN SAYS HE SAW
By JIM BROOKS
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  - The man who reported seeing the mysterious lights in the sky over Norman Sunday night at 6:15 p.m. said his sighting was real and could be substantiated by observers.

The man, who asked not to be identified, said Monday in a telephone interview from Norman that he was driving alone on Interstate 35 to the southwest. He said he noticed the flashing lights, which resembled police car headlights, moving overhead. 

"I noticed them off to my left," he said. "It seemed to cross the sky rather rapidly and then disappeared, just like a light on dark."

The man, who is a university student, said he stopped his car and got out to observe the object better. He said it reappeared, accompanied by a bright light, and seemed to hover over the area for several minutes before disappearing again.

"It was definitely not a conventional aircraft," the man said. "There were no wings and the lights were too bright. We thought at first it might be a jet, but then it stopped and hovered."

The man said he reported the sighting to the Norman police department and to the Air Force base at Tinker. He said the Air Force officers seemed interested in the sighting and promised to investigate it.

ROADS DUE
Jury Probe Eyed 
Of Payoff Story
By DANIEL WEBSTER
In connection with a race fixing scandal in Crawford County, prosecutors and police said Monday they may conduct a special grand jury investigation of allegations of payoffs to municipal officials.

The allegations were made last week to Crawford County district attorney Leo Winters by an unidentified informant who said he had tape recordings of "officials" accepting money.

Winters said Monday he has not decided if he will call the grand jury to investigate the matter, but he confirmed the allegations of payoffs to municipal officials in connection with the race fixing charges which have rocked the county for the past two weeks.

More UFOs Spotted Here

"They" were back Monday night. Strange unidentified objects sighted again in Oklahoma - some say they were "rather scary" compared to the fleet of unidentified flying objects seen over seven other states.

An Oklahoma highway patrolman spotted a green luminescent object on Oklahoma Highway 51 near Claremore last night. The officer said a jet interceptor approached the object but it disappeared.

The officer said a lot of other people also had observed the object and that several of them had called the UFO and appeared to be close to it.

Living costs to go up

The cost of living, says RAYMOND ORTIZ, will rise dramatically in the future due to inflation and other reasons. Ortiz, who has been investigating the UFO situation, says the appearance of the strange objects some call "flying saucers" will create a tremendous public interest in the subject. This in turn will lead to more scientific research and that research will increase the cost of living, Ortiz predicts.

The story about "More UFOs Spotted Here" describes the sighting of strange unidentified objects in Oklahoma, including a report from a highway patrolman who observed a green luminescent object and a jet interceptor approaching it. The "Youth Has His Say" section features a prediction by RAYMON ORTIZ about the cost of living increasing in the future due to inflation and increased scientific research into UFOs.

"First Night Color Shot Of Flying Saucer Bared
Copyright 1965 by The Biyoma Journal Publishing Co.
The most famous photograph in the world this year is the one on this page. It shows a glowing, color image of a flying saucer taken in the dark at an undisclosed location.
The image was captured with a high-speed color film and a wide-angle lens on a 35mm camera. Several observers reported seeing the strange object in the sky and the photographer was able to get this shot, which is the first night color photograph of a flying saucer.
The object, clearly defined in the photograph, shows a circular disk-shaped craft with several portholes or windows which many have speculated contain occupants. The craft appears to be hovering or moving slowly through the night sky.
The picture was taken at about 2:15 a.m. on September 21, 1965 in the vicinity of Carson City, Nevada. It was taken by an unidentified person and later obtained by the Air Force as part of Project Blue Book.
The craft was apparently lit from within, giving off an eerie yellowish-blue glow. This glow makes the details of the craft clearly visible in the night sky. The photographer said he was awakened by a bright flash of light and was able to grab his camera and get several shots of the craft before it moved swiftly away.
The Air Force has made no statement as to what the object may be, but they have confirmed the authenticity of the photograph. They are continuing their investigation to determine the true nature of the object.
This is said to be the most famous photograph of a UFO to date and may provide valuable clues to the continuing mystery of the existence of flying saucers.

DEEP FORK REPORT CITES
OKLAHOMA CITY SIGHTING
"We are releasing a comprehensive report on a recent incident involving a UFO sighting over Oklahoma City. This report, requested by the Air Force, was conducted by James H. Kerr, a photographer, and an associate editor of the JOURNAL. The sighting took place on August 9 and was observed by several reliable witnesses including Alan G. Smith, of Oklahoma City, a well-known newspaper writer.
According to the report, Smith stated he saw the object at about 10:30 p.m. while standing in his front yard. The object was described as round, with a diameter of about 40 feet and with a steady light encircling it. It was hovering silently at an estimated distance of about 250 feet above the ground.
Members of the Smith family who also observed the object said it appeared to be surrounded by a luminous cloud or haze, and they described the light as brilliant white in color. They said the object seemed to increase in the intensity of the light at times.
According to the report, Smith said the object was visible for about 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared from view in the direction of the southwest.
Atmospheric conditions at the time were clear, and the object was visible to all members of the Smith family as well as two other neighbors who happened to see it. The report states that the witnesses could not make out any details of the object's surface, as it was too bright to enable close examination.
This incident, the report concludes, is one of the most clearly defined and well-authenticated UFO sightings to come to the attention of the JOURNAL. The JOURNAL plans to follow up on this report and will reprint it in full in an early edition."

Letter

Dear Letters Editor
I want to congratulate Hayden Strayhorn, director of the Police Relations Division, for his fine work in helping to capture one of the "dangerous" and troublesome criminals in Oklahoma City. This man, who has been terrorizing Oklahoma City and surrounding areas, has finally been captured, thanks to the diligent efforts of Mr. Strayhorn and his Staff. On August 30, 1965 this man, Leroy Skaggs, was arrested, and Sheriff Jim Jones stated that the arrest was definitely a result of the information received from Mr. Strayhorn's office. 
I want to commend Mr. Strayhorn for the outstanding work he and his staff are doing to help law enforcement agencies in the state of Oklahoma. More power to him!

Presnell was convicted of killing a 60-year-old woman in a holdup last month. He was apprehended within minutes after the crime, still in his wheelchair.
The judge commented grimly that he could not overlook the fact that the defendant was armed and dangerous despite his physical handicap. Presnell had entered a plea of innocent by reason of insanity. The jury deliberated only 90 minutes before returning the verdict.

They would go down and then back up and manuever as so forth. They said they were in formation. They were described as silvery in color and a great height.

Deputy James Simms spotted the weached some object with a reddish light on top and a white light underneath. He couldn't see the shape of it, he said, "but I could see it shut twisting a circle of lights. It looked like a large, half-circular group of lights."

Park said he called his wife over when he had the object. It appeared to him to be about the size of a half-dollar at arm's length. It hovered for a while, then accelerated several hundred miles an hour. 

The Daily Oklahoman carried a brief report of two unidentified flying objects seen over Oklahoma City. The Oklahoma State Highway patrol reported a large portion of the state patrolmen and sheriffs had reports of the sightings. 

One youth reported seeing an object rise either from Lake Hefner or its shoreline. Another reported seeing two objects rise from his backyard and shooting straight up out of sight. It was seen about 10:15 PM 5-16-64 SW 43. He said the objects flashed red lights and dashed swiftly high in the sky.  

A resident of El Reno okla. reported a strange orange object that looked like a ball of fire coming down in the west at 9:15 p.m. He watched it for about five minutes and saw it make a sudden burst of speed and disappear.

Another resident saw a bright blue object "which suddenly flashed upwards into the sky from the west" at about 8:30 p.m.

THEORY OFFERED
Mystery Objects
There All Along?
Look at the sky long Why, explains Johnson. That's enough and you'll see - maybe when there are an unusuall-it's not much, but sometimes a large number of stars or a ing these UFO reports, many times there turn up informa- tion that perhaps the object seen "disappears" or "vanishes". thing that looks like a star particularly bright. That's why so many people are under the impression that the objects are "new" or "just appearing".
Dale Johnson, director of the Intellignece Division of the Air Force's Project Blue Book, says the natural phenomenon which causes much of the UFO sighting is simply the "disappearance" of stars in the sky - which goes mostly unnoted.
He says the natural phenomena in the atmophere can "make" stars seem to appear and disappear or vary in brightness, sometimes enough to cause people to think they've "seen a flying saucer". Occasionally," he says, "something may move across the sky and draw attention to the fact that a given star is winking on and off".
But, Johnson believes that in a great majority of cases, the unidentified flying objects that are reported are simply normal celestial phenomona which people don't ordinarily notice. He said this has been the case in many of the UFO reports at this time of year.
The next strong meteor shower, expected to be visible over northern California skies, will no doubt be responsible for many "UFO reports" as some people fail to recognize these fast moving points of light for what they are, Johnson says.
Some people look up at the stars, he said, and many of the things they see passing across the sky are nothing more than tiny satellites. These are not visible to the naked eye and a few people just happen to spot them on occasion.
He gives the current "rash of UFO sightings" in the Carson City area as a good example. Witnesses have reported seeing unusual objects hover, dart, change direction and then disappear. But Johnson believes many of these have simply been misidentifications of normal celestial objects.

Many Report 
Flying Objects

Despite Air Force claims above the horizon southwest 
of Ponca City, Okla., numerous residents in and around 
that area reported seeing unidentified flying objects Tuesday night, according to the Oklahoma Cit-- s Times.'

The Times said the obiect ap- 
peared to be moving at a rapid 
rate both southwest and northeast. Several persons reported seeing the objects at different times 
Tuesday, even high-altitude 
jets could be seen during most of 
the hours of darkness. 

Other reports had green ob- 
jects with bright red and blue 
flashing lights and streaming 
tails observed in the south and 
southwest.

Hundreds of reports were re- 
ceived by the U.S. Weather Bu- 
reau and the Tulsa international Airport, the Times said.

Still, the Weather Bureau an- 
nounced no unusual meteorologi- 
cal activity for the area during 
the period of the sightings.

The Air Force statement said 
that no unidentified flying ob- 
jects were tracked on radar 
screens in the area and that it 
was checking to determine the 
cause of the sightings.

However, the Times said sever- 
al local law enforcement agen- 
cies reported the sightings.

The article went on to state that Air Force official said the 
great plains were active in pro- 
ducing unusual atmospheric phenomena which could be mis- taken for UFOs.

Reports still continued to come in, the Times said, indicating that the sightings were still being 
observed.

CARROLLTON, Man., Charles:-- (KNS) -- Canada's department of defense flew a twin-engine Otter aircraft over a rural area near here Wednesday in an attempt to photograph what residents said 
were unusual objects in the sky.

They said it was traveling at a high rate of speed and was silent. Meanwhile, two Tarrant Countyr deputies in Texas reported that they "looked like fire balls" moving up and down. Hathaway, two of them, one after the other, also observed and reported if white on patrol car searchlight was reflected off something. Around one hour later three separate officers in Lawrenceville, Illinois also observed bright lights in the sky. A policeman in Lewsinville, Kentucky reported strange lights in the sky close to the Lewsinville Divinity School, passed within 100 feet of the Lewsinville Divinity School. He and four other persons observed these strange lights, the lights were about 25 degrees in elevation.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW 
JULY-AUG 65

BELGIUM

Sighting near Antwerp

R. Verstraeten, Boechout, near Antwerp, Belgium, age 17, observed a luminous object on 22 April 1965, from 8:40 to 10:05 p.m. He and his family were in the garden, when they noticed a bright light in the sky about 15 degrees above the horizon, in the south-south-east direction. It was oval-shaped, surrounded by a bluish halo, and seemed somewhat larger than a star. The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then started moving in a straight line. As it moved, it changed color from bluish-white to reddish-orange, and back again. Its speed was estimated to have varied between 800 and 1,000 mph. At times it appeared to be accompanied by smaller lights, and it seemed to be surrounded by a cloud or mist. After about 15 minutes, it disappeared below the horizon.

Intelligence Staffs Plagued by 'Objects' for 20 Years
Intelligence Staffs Plagued by 'Objects' for 20 Years
As Major John Carden Corry, who prepared this text, indicates, the Intelligence Staffs of the U. S. Air Force have been plagued by "Objects" and reports of "flying saucers" for the past 20 years. (See OBJECTS - Page 3)
It is also evident that Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, who had a 3-year tour as director of Project Blue Book, the USAF's official UFO investigating agency, has made a profound study of the situation. His progress, however, has been impeded by these "Objects" concerning which, he says, "there are still a great number of cases in which the object is unidentified."
In the majority of cases, there are explanations, and another conclusion is that you have seen what you think you saw, but there are still many unexplained cases. A UFO might come around daylight UFOs in the balloon. The great balloons carrying scientific instruments can rise to fantastic heights, and in the hours near dawn or dusk can take on brilliant hues. They sometimes take on odd shapes, too, because they are made of transparent material and their outlines are dimmed by reflection from the near-surface. I have seen a perfect sphere formed this way -- (- and have even seen it "launch" something toward earth. The transparent shape which does not outline any familiar shape could be followed by a less vertical trail of smoke or gas, illuminated by a light which before had given the sphere its brilliant hue.
TWO. Another conclusion might prove to be that UFOs are some secret military aircraft, such as jet fighters, flying at tremendous speeds and elevations, or strange-appearing atmospheric phenomena. Relative to the secret military aircraft, there is always the possibility of seeing things which are secret and highly significant. Regarding the atmospheric phenomena, some think on occasion can be observed to be a natural thing. Dependent on the degree, the running lights are seen at certain times, depending on the angle, the time and location of the observer. Some think they are secret military aircraft, and others argue that they are part of our regular programs, some even airplanes.

Our Intelligence Staffs Plug
(Editor's Note: John Conden Currey, who prepared the following report, had a distinguished background in aviation and World War II.)

The recent rush of reports on unidentified flying objects has brought about renewed interest in the activities of our intelligence staffs for nearly two decades. During World War II, such reports came in from Sweden, or from underground sources near the Battle Zone. Correlated with reconnaissance photos and other intelligence, they gave us early data on test flights of the V-1 and V-2 weapons, and on certain other experimental devices which did not get into production for Nazi war machine.

After the war, reports of "flying saucers" over Scandinavia were at first regarded as evidence the Russians had developed certain new projects for their and were developing certain Nazi projects further. Soon these reports spread to the United States. Roswell, Las Alamos, El Paso, and Oak Ridge. Nervous officials admitted these sensitive sites were too important to admit any possible reconnaissance to go undetected.

So the air intelligence crews were ordered to correlate and analyze the reports. One of the first officers assisted with this unwelcome chore was Major Robert B. Smith, USAF, who has just completed a duty as director of intelligence of SAC and more recently with the Pentagon this month, as successor to Colonel Bolender, USAF. He was then a Lieutenant Colonel, his promotion coming after those seeking to explain away the sightings decided to accept as valid. a relatively small number of cases in which the object was tracked on radar or visually observed in the performance of flight characteristics beyond our known capabilities. So the Air Intelligence crews were ordered to correlate and analyze the reports.

Air Force Investigator
Sky Sights Excite Big Area
By Jack Taylor
The weather bureau, said meteorologist had contacted the weather bureau and Tinker Air Force Base had reported strange objects in the sky over Oklahoma City Monday.
The objects, which were seen before dawn Monday, were reported over Oklahoma City and surrounding areas. Later, spokesmen from the Oklahoma City police said they also received several reports of the sightings.
A weather bureau spokesman explained the objects were reported as "targets", meaning they appeared on weather radar screens, but were not jets or other aircraft. He added that the "targets" were scattered over a wide area.
The brilliantly-colored objects were reported over an area ranging from Chickasha, Shawnee, Tulsa and Enid to Lawton and Altus, the weather bureau said.
The Lt. Gov. says he wasn't "concerned" and the reports came from reliable persons, but he couldn't explain the sightings.
Several state officials either confirmed the sightings or said they had received many reports of them. One civilian UFO investigator said he received reports of the incidents from various Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona air force bases.
An Air Defense Command spokesman at Tinker Air Force Base said the incidents were not under investigation there. He said the objects were "nothing unusual" and that his office had no further comment.

said, the weather bureau 
tracked a number of objects on their radar screens in the Oklahoma City area, She said weathermen said the objects seemed to be small planes or other aircraft. 
An object was sighted also in the Wichita, Kan., area about the same time, the dispatcher said.
Hayden Hewes, director of the midwest Skywatch Research Center at Oklahoma City, said his organization had also received a number of the objects sightings since dark.
"We haven't been able to identify them as anything definite yet," he said. "But we've had reports of sightings from a number of places in Oklahoma and as far away as Texas and Colorado."
He said a private pilot in Nebraska reported seeing an object moving at high speed and making a sudden right-angle turn.
The director of the air force's UFO headquarters at Dayton, Ohio, Maj. Hector Quintanilla, said he had received reports of the sightings but had no confirmation yet.
Other sightings were reported from the Tulsa, Okla., area and from Kansas, Missouri and Colorado.

Flying Objects Zooming Over State
By BILL STEWART
A craft, described by witnesses as being the size of a car, glowing red, white and blue, was tracked on two radar screens only shortly before midnight, Saturday.
The Air Force base at Tinker Air Force base, "recovered" Oklahoma yesterday.
The first report, at 8:58 p.m., bid of a strange object moving at a reported speed of 600 to 800 miles an hour. The object, disappearing from radar screens, was reportedly picked up again by a radar tracker at 11:16 p.m.
One deputy, by deputy Sheriff O.C. Bridling, by radar operator JC Brown and Mrs. Marylette Tucker, saw the object for a few seconds. Sherriff Tucker said the glowing object came out of a cloud and headed a little more than a mile away, moving rapidly east.
The military radar tower at Tinker, within the range of 40 miles, reported the object at an altitude of 27,000 feet.
Base officials said "the were aware of the sightings but were not certain what the unidentified craft might be, and they were investigating the matter further."

(10:30 am)
Republican presidential candidate
Nelson Rockefeller predicted
"another glorious victory" for the
GOP in 1966. He claimed that
President Johnson did not have a
clear legislative program and that the
Goldwater candidacy had weakened
the party. He promised political policies
would be shaped on a "bipartisan
basis."
William was reported to
have spoken at a press
conference in Washington
on the British space
program. He said that
the announcement of
the closure of the
Blue Streak and
Skylark projects should
be regarded as a
demonstration of Britain's
intention to move away
from an independent nuclear
deterrent and toward "collective
defense within the alliance."
Speaking at Royal Holloways,
Lord Chalfont, a Minister of
State in the Foreign Office, said
Sunday night Britain's defense
policy was a system whereby we
obtain the maximum collective
security at the minimum cost.

LBJ
Johnson accused Republicans Sunday
of trying to throw Republican Senator
Thurmond out of the party for favoring
the nomination of Georgia's Ellis
Arnall. "If Thurston Thurmond can
be ruled a Republican, we'll call
for a restoration of consistency,"
Johnson added. He said Republicans
did not have any thing to do
with Johnson's nomination or
convention.

The President said that
most of the people the U.S. is
trying to help in South
Viet Nam are members of
a couple of hundred,
families - the richest, the most
elite and most unwilling
to submit to reform.
"This is an Oligarchy
that will make its
sacrifices."

At one point, with the report coming in, the 
radio that reported the objects cut out.
"Dunk, there goes another one."
Toward the end, a postscript wasadded: 
"All equipment aboard the vehicle was

"I have no laboratory, no equipment, no facilities to speculate," he said, "and I'm not going to try to just say what's going on." 
Dr. Don J. Lauer, director of the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno, said such subjects are difficult to handle scientifically.
"The departments at the university were swamped with telephone calls from persons reporting sighting objects in the state," he said.
Lt. Bennett of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported sighting a green object north of Tishomingo traveling "up high." He said a jet plane seemed close to the object.
Several troopers and officers reported similar sightings over Woodward last week.
The Norman police department said a Cleveland County resident, Charles Boyd, reported the "scene of a UFO" and that his report was confirmed by four officers. 
The group viewed a light object, about 25 to 30 feet long, hovering about five feet off the ground south of Norman. The object hovered and then disappeared again to the southeast of Norman. The object then reappeared to more forward, backward and then up and down.
A Gentry, Ark., visitor, Tom Baucelle, at the home of his sister, Mrs. and Mrs. C. Timblin, said he saw a strange object in the sky above the home Monday.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?-Now We Wonder
By Jim Jackson and Ivy Coffey 
of the State Staff

Stars, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions were the order of the day in some sections of Oklahoma and nearby states during the early part of this week as citizens reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

The lights were first reported over the state Monday of a rash of sightings that continued in Oklahoma City and other parts of the state and in Texas, Kansas and Missouri.

Officials in some Oklahoma communities, including Oklahoma City, were of the opinion that the lights may have been the familiar sightings of satellites and aircraft, tut others were not so easily satisfied.

Picture on Page 7
The objects, sometimes described as star-like, sometimes as oval or elongated, were reported in Norman, Woodward, Guthrie, Oklahoma City and other parts of the state and in Texas.

The lights were reported over a period of several evenings starting last Monday, with sight-seeing and aircraft having been active in the skies over some sections.

In Guthrie, R.C. Knoch, an office furniture dealer, said the lights looked too large and too fast to be satellites and that they appeared to be grouped, flying in formation. He said they were "astronomical in nature."

The objects may have been the planets Jupiter and Venus as they were unusually bright this week, but the Air Force said it hasn't any information to confirm this. The Air Force contended the sightings were of normal celestial phenomena.

The term was described as a natural phenomenon, according to an Air Force statement.

Flashing lights and Aerial Shocks
This report comes to us from the 1965 Nevada sightings of September 22, in which a group of people, including a Mexican-American pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO over Carson City and photographed the object, which was later analyzed by the Nevada Air National Guard and Project Blue Book officials.

According to the report, several people, including a pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO over Carson City, Nevada on the previous evening, the 21st. The object was photographed, and the pictures are presently being analyzed by the Nevada Air National Guard and Project Blue Book officials.

Emilio Riva Palacio, Jr. and other officials, were at a private citizens' home when the light and power failure occurred. After the light failure, they saw the object hovering and then suddenly disappear. From this object it lit up the valley around Glenbrook.

Shortly afterwards, Guillermo Manzano, a pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO of light configuration, as did several others in the area. An attempt was made to approach the object, but it caused the aircraft to suffer a series of electric shocks and forced it to return to its base without further incident.

Gassisson cylinder
The main object appears to be a long cylinder, about 40 feet in length and 12 feet in diameter, which is reported to have been observed on the ground near Carson City, Nevada, on 22 Sep 65. The object is described as having a smooth metallic surface and was said to give off a faint hum. It apparently landed gently and was able to take off vertically, leaving no disturbance of the ground. The object was observed by several people, including a Dr. C. H. Dirvin of Glendale, California, who was able to make a close approach to the object. The observations indicate this was a structured craft of some sort, but its purpose and origin remain unknown. No information is provided about the peculiar name 'Gassisson' applied to this object.

New Comet Promises Big Show

Astronomers are predicting that the new comet which has been discovered will put on a spectacular show after it passes closest to the sun later this month. 

Designated comet Ikeya-Seki, it will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on October 21. The comet's tail, which is already visible in the western sky after sunset, is expected to become brilliant and very long.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, director of the Harvard College Observatory, says the new comet may well become the brightest seen in this century. It will be so bright that it may even be visible in the day for several days around the time it passes closest to the sun.

The comet was discovered independently by two Japanese amateur astronomers, Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki, last month. It is racing toward the sun at a speed of about 375,000 miles per hour and will swing around the sun at a distance of only about 300,000 miles from the sun's surface.

Most comets weaken or break up when they get that close to the sun because of the intense heat. This one, however, astronomers believe, will survive the encounter and emerge even more brilliant as it swings back out into space.

There is some speculation that this comet may be related to the great comet of 1882, which was also a very brilliant object.

RADCLIFFE COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.
By Racer County Police
MYSTERY SPACE SHIP IS TOO FAST FOR Z-CAR

A COUNTY POLICE squad car was called to Radcliffe College last night to investigate an unidentified flying object. The police reported that the object was too fast for the squad car to keep up with and it disappeared from view.

The report stated that several students and faculty members witnessed the object, which was described as a bright, glowing craft that maneuvered rapidly through the sky over the college. It is the latest in a series of UFO sightings reported in the Cambridge area in recent weeks.

Campus police said they were unable to determine the nature or origin of the object. It was noted that the craft appeared to have no visible means of propulsion and made no noise as it moved through the air.

The incident has been reported to the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigates UFO sightings. Authorities are urging anyone with additional information about the sighting to contact the Air Force or local law enforcement.

on the night of August 24, 1965. Ken Skinner, photographer for the NBC television news service in Reno, Nevada, said he photographed a mysterious object in the sky over Reno that night. Skinner said he watched the object for several minutes as it moved across the sky. "It seemed to change color as it moved about for several minutes", he said. "I took several pictures of it as it moved up, down and all around it", Skinner said. "At various times it looked bluish green, then it changed colors. It did not have flashing lights like an airplane." Although the object was much larger than a star, Skinner said he felt it was about the same size as the full moon. "When they first saw it, they thought it might be something like an eclipse," he told Associated Press. "But it kept moving, making the lighting 'just different.'" "The photograph has been examined by authorities and is considered unexplained.

'Ball Of Fire' Sails Off More Saucer Reports

A "ball of fire" sighted over Lebanon and Rockwood, Pa., is reported to have changed direction and speed several times, giving additional details of the prevalence at this time of the "flying saucer" reports in various parts of the State.

Mrs. Clyde Campbell, who lives near the Rockwood area, said that she and others in her family observed the mysterious object shortly before 9:30 p.m. Sunday. She described it as a bright light, approximately the size of a peach, moving in a westerly direction across the clear sky.

At this same time, police and other residents of the nearby communities of Warrensville and Wilkes-Barre reported sighting the strange light. One resident of Warrensville said it was almost as large as the moon and appeared to be traveling at great speed.

The UFO Center called the incidents "another in the continuing series of sightings in the central Pennsylvania area."

THE AUGUST WAVE

No date. Informati on received through Air Force channels. 
SOURCE: USAF.

Editor's note: The following is a summary of information presented to this office by an officer of the U.S. Air Force, relative to reports of public safety concern arising from several sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Carson City, Nevada area:

It was last again and was observed that the objects had the ability to hover and then dart through the air it tremendous speed. One object was estimated to have covered a distance of 3,500 feet in about 2 seconds. No other discernable features of these objects have been detected nor is there any other information available as to their nature or origin. 

The Air Force base, Oklahoma, has been informed. This was the first of sightings which occurred in the area and was reported Sunday, August 21, 1955, about 8:00 P.M. when a motorist and his passenger returning to Carson City from Reno, Nevada, observed three bright objects about 30 feet in diameter, hovering over an area about 10 miles south of Carson City. The objects appeared to be under intelligent control and at times seemed to hover motionless, then dart about at tremendous speed. This was witnessed by several other persons in the area and reported to local police and the U.S. Air Force.

On Monday, August 22, 1955, between 9:00 and 10:00 A.M., a State Highway Patrol Officer, while on his regular patrol near Carson City, observed a similar object hovering in the sky at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. He was able to keep the object under observation for about 10 minutes. He reported that while the object appeared to be metal it did not reflect light. It gave the appearance of a flat, circular object about 30 feet in diameter. It made no noise and there was no visible means of propulsion. At one point, the object appeared to shoot a beam of light toward the ground, then resumed its hovering. The officer could not hear any sounds from the object. The object then accelerated and disappeared from sight at a tremendous speed. The officer reported this sighting to his superiors.

On Tuesday, August 23, 1955, about 7:30 A.M., a resident of Carson City reported seeing an object similar to those previously described hovering over the city. He was able to observe it for about 45 minutes. Other persons in the area also reported seeing the object.

Other sightings have been made and reported to the U.S. Air Force and local authorities. Newspapers, radio and television stations have carried extensive coverage of these incidents.

It was stated that the information presented here was taken from the files of the U.S. Air Force and that the Air Force has had the matter under investigation. No further details are available at this time. The sources contacted have advised that they are continuing their investigation and will make further details available if and when they are developed.

REPORTS TWO UFO OBJECTS IN THE SKY
OVER CARSON CITY, NEVADA ON 8-6-65.

Witness: NORMAN and DORIS BUCHANAN reported observing two unidentified stationary objects between Norman and Doris Buchanan's home in Carson City, Nevada and the Nevada State Prison, at about 10:50 P.M. on 8-6-65.

They first observed the objects at about 10:45 P.M. through their living room window. The objects appeared to be round or oval-shaped and were stationary in the sky. One object seemed to be slightly larger than the other. They watched the objects for about 5 minutes. 

NORMAN BUCHANAN estimated the objects were about 3-4 miles south of their home, traveling in a north-south direction. The objects were visible until dark clouds covered them. No sound was heard. The objects appeared to be silver with black windows or port holes. 

Norman Buchanan reported the incident to the telephone CAPITAL 3-1277, Authority: Reno, Nevada. The information has been provided on the wire from Oklahoma City and Reno, Nevada. The witnesses were given a polygraph test which showed they were telling the truth. There is no additional information available.

On 8 August 1965, several citizens in Oklahoma City reported seeing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being larger than a Boeing 707 aircraft, or about 75 feet in diameter. It was observed to make sudden stops and changes in direction, and to move at a high rate of speed. The object was reported to have a bright light on the front and a steady red light on the rear. Several detailed sightings are described, including reports from a pilot, an air traffic controller, and a police officer. The document also discusses previous sightings in the area and potential explanations, noting that the object did not appear to be a conventional aircraft. The report concludes that the nature of the object remains unknown.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a newspaper article from "The Daily Oklahoman" dated August 7, 1955 with the headline "Discs in Sky Spill Phones, Nerves Jing".

The text in the article is as follows:

"Police in three southwestern Oklahoma cities were deluged with telephone calls reporting strange objects in the sky. Witnesses said they showed colors from white to orange.

Six New Mexico sightings were reported at Hobbs, Carlsbad and Artesia City. 

In Bartlesville, Oklahoma, residents told police they saw an object about the size of a plane going down southwest of Bartlesville or a large craft hovering. 

A local city resident reported he saw an object move across the sky, changing colors from red to white and back to red. He said it flew about a minute and then appeared to hover or to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon.

First sighting report Sunday night was from the area between Purcell and Norman. However, officials could not verify any moving objects in the sky but said a very brilliant light was visible both that evening and the following morning.

Despite all the reports, some of them contradictory, some well-versed in flying object reports say this latest incident may not be too significant."

THE DAILY O

Bright Objects in Sky

An unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported seen in the sky near here yesterday evening according to a telephone report received at the Nevada Highway Patrol offices. The highway patrol, in turn, notified the air force.

The New Mexico UFO sightings continue as residents at Carlsbad and Artesia report seeing bright, round objects maneuvering in the sky, one of which was said to have come down near the ground a few miles northeast of Carlsbad.

A Del City resident reported seeing a strange object light up the sky, hover, then streak away at a high rate of speed. As it went it seemed to change colors.

The highway patrol reported that persons living in an area west of Roswell saw the UFO and called the patrol. Officers investigated but were unable to substantiate the report. The sighting was about 11:30 p.m. Two daughters and a son, all of whom live in the area, watched the objects for about five minutes, the patrol said.

"OKLAHOMA CITY TIMES Monday, August 2, 1965

More Evidence Claimed

"Saucers" Fly Pattern

Hayden, Idaho (AP)-- "Saucers" flew over our planet? Wouldn't you say they were drawn against our darkened nighttime skies, swooping to and fro, disappearing and reappearing without any visible noise?

With that, Hayden Hewes, Oklahoma City investigator, has been studying the curious phenomena of sightings of round flying objects. He says he has heard such reports for years.

Hewes went without sleep for two nights, he said, in making a check at patrol's headquarters in Edmond, Okla., seeking further clues on one that had been reported sighted over Oklahoma City and nearby towns.

A motion picture and a television newscast were made of this, Hewes said, and "it was unbelievable, less than 1,000 feet from the ground and a television camera couldn't get a clear focus on it."

"It was something like a quarter of the size of the moon and it would take off and everything would be obliviated," he said. "You could see it, then it would be gone."

Hewes, who has had some 2,500 reported sightings from Oklahoma and adjoining states by various law enforcement agencies of "flying saucers," said he can't explain what they are.

"They have been reported hovering, taking off at tremendous speeds, making right angle turns, splitting into two or three objects, going down to the ground and getting back up into the air again," he said.

"I believe there is something out there which to the best of my knowledge we don't fully understand."

Hewes said, however, he leans more toward the spaceman theory than the weather balloon or any other possible explanation at the present time."

The image contains a photograph of a person examining or working on some equipment, likely related to the UFO reports described in the text. The text below the image is titled "Sky Objects Excite Region" and discusses reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that were tracked by the Air Force and reportedly observed by military and civilian personnel in various locations.

The deluge of reports is described as being recorded by the official record of UFOs, and details are provided about various sightings, including one near Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. The text also mentions that some sightings were observed near the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Overall, the document appears to be a report or news article describing UFO-related incidents and investigations.

OCR output:

The deluge of reports is recorded in the official record of UFO's, according to Col. John A Taety, they received 50 co to UFO reports during the night of Sept. 7, from Oklahoma Highway Patrol headquarters. officials at Tinker Air Force Base reported: "a brilliant light was seen moving across the sky" shortly after midnight of Sept. 7. Reports of UFO's poured in from Tinley, Claremore, Tulsa, Bartlesville, Pryor, Sand Springs, Chandler, Perry, Rogers, Warner, Byron, Cushing, Kingfisher, Weatherford and Belle Plaine. Officials in Kans. and Wichita, Kan., also reported seeing the strange objects, as did observers in Oklahoma from Chickasha, El Reno, Norman, Okeemah, Wetumka, Guthrie, Shawnee, Pauls Valley, Holdenville, McAlester, Antlers, Stigler, Sallisaw, Idabel, Durant, Broken Bow, Hugo, Tishomingo and Ardmore. 
The Air Force and the U.S. Weather Bureau said they were investigating the reports with the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies. A weather bureau spokesman explained they found no unusual weather conditions to account for the sightings, and some of the sightings were tracked on radar. A USAF spokesman stated the Air Force is only concerned with the UFO reports that could be a threat to the nation's security. He said the Air Force does not either confirm or deny a report of a UFO unless it is a matter of national security. Such confirmation or denial would only come from the Air Force Chief of Information or the Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs. In connection with the Oklahoma sightings, the Weather Bureau spokesman said some of the reports could be readily explained as planets, stars and some of the sighting could not be so easily dismissed.

Stars in Their Eyes? Many Insist 'Flying Objects' Seen
Despite Air Force claims to the con-trary, a lot of citizens "insist that they have seen strange objects in the sky that defy identification," the report states.
Dale Johnson, director of the Department of Investigations of the Research Analysis Corp., is quoted as saying that "the Air Force just poo-poos everything."
The report goes on to discuss various sightings of unidentified flying objects, including one in Carson City, Nevada, that was witnessed by several law enforcement officers. It also mentions the "theory offered" that "mystery objects" are present in the skies, and discusses the debate around whether these are real or simply misidentifications.

THEORY OFFERED
Mystery Objects
There All Along?
This is also the theory offered by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, consultant to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, on "Flying Saucers". He says the natural phenomena which cause such sightings are present all the time, but people simply don't notice them until they are pointed out. If you're not accustomed to looking for such phenomena, he explains, you won't see them, but they are there all along -- "right under our noses."

Johnson believes that in the vast majority of cases, people notice "strange lights" simply because the conditions are right to make the lights visible. He does not believe they are witnessing anything extraterrestrial.

OKLAHOMA CITY TIMES 7* THURSDAY. JULY 22 1965

WIN ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP TO LOS ANGELES TO ATTEND

Disappointed Citizen's a CFUFor Now 

Hopeful Gazer Draws Blank 

THE SNFBS had a case last night that left some new members Tuesday. His also is eligible for membership in the CFUFO lodge. 

The case was rather simple.It seems that a bunch of Oklahoman s were present at a place called Carson City, Nevada, on the night of Aug. 29. 1964. while the "light angle" was based upon a originally published report. 

One anxious moment came when one of the group thought he had sighted something in the sky. But after studying it for over an hour and a half, it turned out to be nothing more than a star, while the rest of the group were present at the time. 

It seems there are no verified film of photographs of this new tale of UFO - some of the disappointed Oklahomans were present at this particular sighting, and they reported the "hopeful gazer" in this case did not catch anything on film. 

There's not a bright "spur" to this new tale of UFOs - it brought back memories from a first of the flying saucer films ever made - "The Disappearance".

Some Oklahoma Citysns breathed good sigh of relief, as they had watched the skies in the past for the first time in years.

Air Intelligence "Staff" Pilot Sighted

Editor's Note: John Casantos Curry, who prepared this release, was an astronomer and military intelligence affairs officer. He coordinated this report:

The present case of reports on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) seen by a U.S. Air Force pilot, at 11:40 hrs., on 3l July 1965, near Carson City, Nevada, is considered important.

During World War II, such reports came often from pilots but were usually explained as enemy aircraft. Since 1946, a number of such reports have come from properly trained observers - some of whom were personnel in the armed forces - reporting on sightings of unidentified objects that did not correspond to any known aircraft, balloons, or astronomical phenomena. These have included observations of lights, shapes, and motions which could not be identified with any conventional air or space craft.

After the war, reports of "flying saucers" were also received from various parts of the world, some indicating that these objects were real physical entities - and not just hallucinations or psychological phenomena. Some of these gave way to "flying cigars" or "flying fishes" reports and other descriptive terms as the shapes of the objects varied - but all indicating that there were unidentified flying objects - craft that were not of this earth.

The present case is one of the few instances where the reliable report comes from a U.S. Air Force pilot, indicating that he saw a cigar-shaped object with red and green lights blinking on and off, which maneuvered at a speed far in excess of any known aircraft. This report is added to a growing number of such accounts by competent observers, including military and scientific personnel.

Echo I Up 5 Years 

Echo I, the satellite which was launched on 12 August 1960, has now been in orbit for 5 years. This is an achievement and has more significance than just the longevity of a space vehicle in orbit. The satellite is being tracked over a large portion of the globe and serves as a reference point for geodetic and navigation studies. Its signals are used to locate and identify various points on the surface of the earth with great accuracy.

Echo I is a larger, more solid sphere. In a polarized light, the sun's rays are reflected from the metal-coated surface, and this reflection gives a distinctive "echo" quality to the signals received on earth. Whether beamed, pulsed, or continuous wave, the signals from Echo I are easily picked up by ground receiving stations around the world. Echo I, in its orbit, passes directly over the United States from horizon to horizon twice a day. This satellite is a brilliant object in the sky, reflecting the sun's rays, and is easily seen by the naked eye, especially at dawn and dusk, when it appears as a bright "star" passing overhead.

View's Range 12-20 Minutes

The satellite is in view for an average of 12 to 20 minutes, since scientists have found that it can be seen continuously for this period of time. Some orbits are longer, some shorter, but the average is in this range. Thus, the signals from Echo I can be monitored and recorded for this period of time.

Lights reflected on low clouds, or beams of light coming through breaks in the clouds, have also been observed by watchers when Echo I passes overhead. One must add a few more facts:

1. The satellite is not visible when the sun's rays do not strike its surface.

2. Low clouds, fog, or mist obscure the view.

3. Slowly, slowly, it passes a near or pole moving star across the sky until it disappears at the horizon. It is only visible during the period of time when the sun's rays are striking its metallic surface.

The importance of the Echo I satellite in the field of geodesy and navigation cannot be overemphasized. It is a ready-made target, so to speak, high in the sky, that can be tracked by stations on the ground. The information gained from such tracking is invaluable in mapping the earth's surface and in navigation studies.

Virgence Staffs Plagued by 'Objects' for 20 Years
Seven former military jet pilots, who prepared training flights, have been plagued by strange phenomena first experienced in 1945. Strange lights flashing, all have red left winking, green right warning lights, and white tail lights, and most have the orange-red flashing anticollision lights above and below the tail light. As these military jets and airliners pass overhead, the sighting relative position of the ground objects remains unchanged, and the strange light phenomena do not change in sequence or intensity. The article describes these strange light phenomena as a potential threat to aviation safety.
View's Range 12-20 Minutes
The article states that as recorded, these satellites are in view from 12 to 20 minutes. Since observers have noted that this point, one or another of these strange objects normally appears.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?

Experts have been examining the phenomena which they state are strange, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions observed by pilots and others.

On March 8, L. S. Montebanito, USAF maintenance controller, reported that air force pilots in the area had spotted the objects and reacted that the objects turned out to be stationary but which turned out to be unusually bright stars.

The lights were reported over a period of several minutes to observers in Carson City, Nevada.

L. Eugene Cuscino, Jr., a technician, used binoculars and observed the objects for several minutes.

The objects turned out to be stars, brighter than normal, in full daylight.

In a statement also pointed out that similar reports of unusual lights in the sky had been common in the past and were generally found to be stars or planets appearing unusually bright.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?
By Jim Jackson and Ivy Cofey

The official air force explanation of the sightings was that they were caused by air-force activity, such as jets, weather balloons, etc., and that they were not extraordinary in any way. However, we are told that the witnesses in this case were some of the personnel at the Stead Air Force Base, near Reno, Nevada, and that their sightings were not limited to the official air force explanations. In fact, they claimed to have seen strange objects maneuvered in various ways which defied the explanation given. The sightings were not confined to the Stead AFB, but extended to nearby areas and neighboring states.

Though the air force tries to explain the objects as being manifestations of normal air force activities, the people who saw them insist that they were of an extraordinary nature. And, as Maj. Monndhall, USAF, states, "the witnesses in this case were very reliable people" and their sightings deserved a closer study.

The sightings in the sky were continuing. The object or objects were reported a number of times during a period covering several months. They were described as glowing brightly and as having a pulsating motion. They were seen by a number of people at various locations, including near Durant, Oklahoma, and into neighboring states.

It is claimed that the objects varied in size, apparently merging into the clouds at time. Sometimes they appeared to change colors, sparkling in the sky.

The announcement from the air force was that the sightings were merely weather balloons and nothing more extraordinary. However, the witnesses insisted that they could not have been weather balloons, as the motions and maneuvers were quite unusual. The objects were said to be large and to have lights that pulsated and changed colors, unlike weather balloons.

The report states that Harry H., an aircraft mechanic at Stead AFB, saw three of the objects and described them as round, glowing and hovering. They made a vertical takeoff and then moved out of sight rapidly. 

Another witness, Ed Charles Dellufai, of the Lackland AFB, Texas, said that while he was driving on the highway in Nevada, he saw a large glowing object which slowed down and then shot off to the north and then it stopped. Dellufai said that the object was 100 to 150 feet in diameter and had a row of white lights around it.

It was reported that there were other sightings, and the objects varied in size. Some of them were as large as Platter-shaped and had a glowing base. Some were said to be like an ice-cream cone with a glowing stem. The objects were also reported to have sound which was described as a roaring or a humming sound.

The air force continued to insist that these sightings were ordinary air force activities and nothing more. However, the people who saw them insisted that what they saw could not be explained away so easily and that the air force was not telling the whole truth.

The image contains a photograph showing a close-up view of a weather balloon. The photograph appears to be part of a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Identification: According to officials at Perrin Air Force Base, these are large-size weather balloons. They withheld positive identification until they were sure. In the meantime, they were reported as a sighting.
Tests: Tests conducted on the object by officials showed that it is definitely not a flying saucer and is a weather balloon. It was scheduled to be launched but was not due to weather conditions.
Markings: The object had markings and inscriptions on it, indicating that it was a weather monitoring device.
Observation: Witnesses reported seeing four moving objects over the horizon in the early morning. The objects appeared to be dome-shaped and were ascending rapidly.
Light: A bright light was seen shining from the top of the objects.
Observation: The witness watched the objects for about 15 minutes, and they hovered and descended to an altitude of about 2,000 feet before fading from view. He said the objects seemed to play a "lighthearted game" and were "up to something."

THE MAIN INVASION WAVE
Wynnewood, Oklahoma July 31, 1965
At 1:05 a.m. on the morning of 
July 31, 1965, an unidentified flying object 
was observed approximately 5 miles west 
of Wynnewood, Oklahoma. Witnesses 
stated that the object was circular in shape, 
about 100 feet in diameter, and glowing 
brilliantly. The object moved slowly from 
Wynnewood toward Oklahoma City at an 
altitude of approximately 2,000 ft. The 
UFO then moved to the west for approximately 10-15 
minutes and returned to its original position. 
The object appeared to have a center core 
and seemed to flare or pulsate. The UFO 
appeared to have three times as much 
brilliance than the morning star Venus. 
After remaining stationary for several 
minutes, the UFO began to move again 
and was sighted by highway patrolman 
N.L. Buchanan of KWTV Channel 9, 
Oklahoma City. Buchanan stated that it 
was lost again a short time later.

As the night continued, so did the UFO reports. Chickasha, Guthrie, Stillwater, Tulsa, Norman and Oklahoma City all reported UFO sightings. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers reported four of them in the area. One trooper saw a UFO which coincided with a call reporting one. The UFO, after two hours, faded out or shot off.

Air Intelligence Staff's Plagued by 'Objects' for 20 Years

She was picked up by ambulance
at Norman, Okla. from Presbyterian Hospital. She had witnessed the crash and had noticed 2 craft hovering overhead at 10:00 p.m.

We conducted a personal interview with the witness (M) at 1:15 p.m. on Monday, August 9, 1965. (M) stated that she first observed 2 peculiar aircraft hovering over the site about 10:00 p.m. on Sunday evening, August 8, 1965. Shortly thereafter, she heard a loud explosion and saw flames coming from the ground. She immediately called the Sheriff's Office and local civil defense authorities.

An Oklahoma City Television Crew arrived on the scene shortly afterwards and began taking pictures and filming the crash area. They too, observed the 2 overhead craft. (M) stated that when the ambulance arrived to remove the injured, she noticed the 2 craft suddenly accelerate skywards at a very high rate of speed. The colors of the craft were green, or blue-green, the colors were alternated and were arranged in a distinct pattern.

(M) further stated that the object overhead appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and the other a bit smaller. No engine noises were heard from either craft, and they appeared to be completely silent in their operation. Also, (M) stated that the overhead craft were equipped with a red flashing light, blinking on and off at a rather fast rate. This was the only external lighting observed on the craft.

After the ambulance had left the scene, (M) went over the area and located two small pieces of the wreckage. She collected these and turned them over to the Sheriff's Office. These were in turn given to me for further examination. To date, the analysis of these samples has proved inconclusive.

The investigation is continuing, and any further information on this incident will be forwarded.

The photo is said to be taken at 4:20 a.m. at the municipal airport. Four objects were photographed in the sky, hovering at an estimated altitude of 15,000 feet. The photo shows four circular white objects, roughly 45 feet in diameter, with a bright light in the center.
On July 23, 1952, the photographs were taken by a local resident and sent to the Director of the program. The photos show images of the four objects in the sky, hovering at an estimated altitude of 15,000 feet. The objects appear to be circular in shape, approximately 45 feet in diameter, with a bright light in the center. The text also mentions that the objects were observed for some time and that the people who witnessed the event are considered to be reliable.

1. The attached information pertaining to unidentified flying objects (UFO's) is forwarded for your information and possible use. In accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2, paragraph 11, Volume XVII, dated 25 September 1959, you are requested to consider this information and provide any additional comments or recommendations you may care to make.
2. On 31 July 1965 at 0735 Zulu (Z) hours, the initial report in this case was received at this office from the USAF installation located at

3. On 1 August 1965, Harry P. Addrili, Meteorological Technician and Supervisor, Civil Engineering Division, was interviewed regarding his UFO sighting. Addrili stated his organization maintains a visual watch for UFO's. Around 0735 Zulu on 31 July 1965, Addrili and several other persons observed a bright shiny white light object emitting a red pulsing light which was attached to a parachute or balloon. Addrili stated the object moved rapidly in a southerly direction and disappeared during his observation which lasted approximately 5 minutes. Addrili further stated the radio sound equipment would normally begin to oscillate, although this did not occur. He said the pulsing light and the manner in which the object moved were different from the normal balloon or parachute appearances. Addrili noted the object was a bright shiny white in color which is the predominant color displayed by other UFO sightings in this area.

A. According to the text, on 13 July 1965, the balloon CASS 9 located at approximately 45,000 feet over Carson City, Nevada, was tracked by ground radar. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 100 feet in diameter, and it was drifting toward Woodlawn at that time. The object could have contained a small balloon inside it, but this could not be determined.

B. Records maintained by the 746th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron indicate that on 31 July 1965, at approximately 10,000 feet altitude, an unidentified object was picked up on radar. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 600 knots and was maneuvering erratically. After approximately 10 minutes, the object disappeared from the radar.

C. On 6 August 1952, two witnesses in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, interviewed regarding any UFOs they might have observed between 21 July and 6 August 1952. The witnesses stated that they did not observe anything unusual during that time period.

TEEM/UTO
UFO SIGHTING 7 OCTOBER 1965

HQ USAF SAYOICS (Mrs. Hunt)

We have received a report of an unidentified flying object from
Mrs. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - at 3:05 am PT on 7 Oct 65. She reported her sighting. A review 
of her report indicates that the object appeared circular in shape and
had a luminous glow. It was observed for about 20 minutes as it
maneuvered and hovered in the sky. The object was first observed
to the west of her location and moved slowly to the north and then
back to the west before disappearing. The description of the object
conforms with this analysis. It was described as about 50 feet in
size, capable of very rapid acceleration and deceleration, and
oscillating or "pulsating" with a bright light. These are typical
characteristics of UFO's as they have been observed in the past.
A light was observed toward the northwest as the object seemed to
diminish in size and disappear. No sounds were associated with the
observation. 
This object was observed for a period of about 20 minutes, much
shorter than the 30 seconds reported by the witnesses. The duration
of sightings can vary greatly depending upon the distance from the
observer and the atmospheric conditions.
We have given you an evaluation of a possible sighting.

Early in 1965, I had a visit from a man who had said that he had seen a UFO. Also, I saw a very clear picture of a man who said he was in contact with beings from another planet. I have more personal experience to indicate that we are being visited by beings from other planets, but the facts I would cite might sound too unbelievable to be taken seriously.
WHAT AND WHERE DID YOU SEE: Aug. 26, 1965 near CARSON CITY, NEVADA. At about 6:30 PM, I was driving approximately 4 miles from Carson City, Nevada, when I saw a large, silvery, circular craft hovering silently above the desert floor, about 400 yards away. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. The craft was motionless for about 2 minutes, then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The whole incident lasted only about 3 minutes.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  20 January 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Pertaining to sighting 33 - 
I feel that the details of follow up is not adequate and lack of continued recording of information when a point of additional investigation is detected. 
As I noted there were 6 persons (before a witness) who said they saw this - the said that no two descriptions were alike, when a point of discrepancy arrives it was not followed up where additional information might be secured.
Curiosity does - after the fact investigation by said interviewing investigator for need not to discard anomaly simply because 'it does not fit into a pre-established pattern'
My said view I shared approx on 8/31/1965.
Also, 8 month delay in your contact with me I take it is your normal procedure.

A1. It is still possible to occur, but time alone will prove or disprove the intimate nature of the statement. I have been instructed to remain silent as regards the case.

G.S. - I feel little I have not been very much more deeper of some, and consummating quite these is hurry to the question to have answer different. Some show to have already years flying in a direction that I should indeed had several in a minimum and a recent principal of this matter I saw chief met even remarkable fellow. And also, the physical or nature trail was recently like fit - although strange slight wild (CS), like a flame it was looked out.

Vatter proof  shot at face of C   
Claimed it blinded him for a few seconds, when he came to it was falling.  So I asked see on a night to our destination, I named it and other drivers would report it is something strange, it sure would be a balloon or helicopter or airplane, it couldn't do so still a secret. I suppose have an inside track since I'm watching it and have seen something could be mistakable as UFO being on the subject.

Went to Garman road or Case Park, heading out that way to be going, where Bron and wood ducks so fit for going which to animals. Isn't the first of them in the park nearby? Gone for practical joke on that time. Only the jackass been the visitor, even if we really. Haven't had any enough so entrance my bath on this day. If it wasn't a raining of above, have to find out each as I can think of it.
