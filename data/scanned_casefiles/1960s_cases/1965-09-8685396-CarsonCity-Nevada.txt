At 8:05 on July 31, 1965 Wynnewood police officer, reported an unidentified flying object NE of approximately 30-350 simultaneously radar fixes were obtained by Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, and Carswell AFB, Fort Worth, Texas.

Officer observed the object with his wife for approximately 10 minutes in front of their home, then officer drove across town and observed the object for three more minutes. His wife watched the object until almost 21:30AM.

An "intelligent control" was indicated during the first 10 minutes of observation when the object abruptly gained 1000-1500 ft in altitude (estimated by to be 10,000 ft, confirmed by radar at 8,000ft). The object remained stationary for several minutes and abruptly lost approximately 1500-2,000 ft. The object then moved to the West for approximately 1000-1500ft and returned to the original location. At which time the object moved to the East for approximately 1000-1500 ft then returned to its original position. (Drawing A)

The night sky was clear and many stars were visible. The object appeared to be about three times as bright as the evening star. The UFO was estimated to be 5 or more miles NE of Officer and appeared as a "light" source. The object itself was white with a blue-green center, with a red rotating light circling the center (Drawing B).

At approximately 1:15 officer drove across town and once again observed the object at approximately 1:30. His wife reported that the object (while he was gone) seemed to change colors, and shapes and fade out. Both Tinker AFB and Carswell AFB, tracked the object to a point 15 miles southwest of Tinker when it disappeared. A few minutes later, it was tracked to a location 29 miles south of Tinker when it was lost again. A Beechcraft airliner.

HGUFO INVESTIGATES -

I first learned of the Wynnewood sighting at 9105 when [redacted] called and wanted to know what all I knew.
Within an hour [redacted] and I were on our way. We arrived at the Wynnewood Police station and talked
with the chief of police who showed me the first information
he had received from [redacted] in the form of the notation
he had observed a U.F.O. and reported it to Tinker AFB. Prior
to talking with the chief of police I had called [redacted].
[redacted] another of the chief of police who stated that they had no
comment and that a report had been sent to Tinker. The chief
of police suggested that we go over to [redacted] house
and talk with him. He gave us directions. When we arrived
a reported from Ada, Oklahoma was talking to [redacted]
wife. I outside. I intruded myself and was told that I
could not be disturbed. I told them I had the official
A. reporting forms and that all my information would be turned
over to you. I was permitted to enter the home and talked
for about 2 1 hours. While I was there the telephone rang
about 10 times. They had received calls from New York, Conn.
and Tulsa. While I was there a reported from the Sunday Oklahoman
called, when he was told no information we asked if I had been
there and I talked with him. He asked me to call him as soon
as I returned to Oklahoma City. They wanted NO publicity at all.
[redacted] did not want to return to work (works the night
shift six [redacted] a rank) because anyone would know where
he was. He has been with the force for about a year. Before
coming to Wynnewood he was a [redacted] in Arizona. They first
believed the object to be a aircraft. He has served in the Navy
and Army and was showed a UFO film that stated the Navy did not
know what the objects were and to report all objects that they
might observe. He knew of the Utah and Montana filing, but not
much about the UFO file in general. At first he could not talk
at all. After I told him about the HGUFO and the recent flap
of sightings, my trip to Wright-Patterson AFB, and general information he was most cooperative. I am out of sighting forms so
the answers to the 24 questions are as follows.

Mrs Bill Tipton 1Â½ miles West of Davenport on US 66 watched an object which was described as reddish on the bottom and white on the top hover for 15 minutes and move off to the West. Tinker AFB 1 to 4 on radar and they advise they are flying very high, approximately 22,000 which seems to coincide with the visual altitude. All very high.

"This is as much as I can tell you at the moment.

Dr. Finch comments:
Several interesting points emerge from this episode. We have an example of 'selective attraction'. Why, we ask, was it only Michael Johnson and not the others who appeared to be attracted to the object?

Again, the other two sitting in the car appear to have an emanating force field; again, the effect of the force field appears remarkable in the fact that according to its intensity (or distance from source), so the effect varies from simply peripheral nerve paralysis to major interruption of cerebration, resulting in loss of consciousness, shock and loss of memory.

This case should be compared with the Colchester case (Paul Green), also the Valensole case which you tell me will be dealt with in detail in this issue of the review, and the Brazilian areas.

Footnote
It should be remembered that, according to the newspaper account, the case was considered the explanation given by Mr. May and Miss Foster for the mysterious effects was that of a "magnetic field" or "magnetic storm" which might have caused the reported phenomena. This their learned veterinarian.

1965 JULY 31

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT
SIGHTED OVER OKLAHOMA

OKLAHOMA CITY, July 31 (AP) - A mysterious object was sighted early today. I will try to find out how the object was first spotted and find it accurately for a red, blue and white light.

I received the incident to the California Highway Patrol. Unidentified Flying Object at Oklahoma City was reported by several persons. The object was over Government installations, Under officials and the Air Traffic was authorized to give in the first.

Fort Worth, Tex., also located the object from radar and both tracker and Control tracked the object in a point 15 miles south of Tulsa or Tulsa at which time it was tracked from both radar and visual sightings. After a few minutes time and tracked it a point 29 miles south of Tulsa where it again disappeared, it was not tracked.

ENGLAND
Ovalloid object
of Sussex

A Sussex reader who writes to maintain anonymity has sent the following graphic account of a sighting which he made on September 20, 1965, at about 1 p.m.:

NEAR Beach, Selsey, Sussex, close to the sea, on a very warm, brilliant afternoon. It was very clear, and the air very still. The tide was low, far out across the flat beach. No wind except the very lightest breeze. The horizon was level. I was on the top of a rise. I was alone. I had observed at empty sky as I walked there, that being my job as an artist. There were no clouds . . . closed my eyes for a minute only, to shut out the glare. When I opened my eyes, looking up at an angle of 45 degrees. It was then, with a start, that I saw itâperhaps half a mile out to seaâperhaps half a mile upâperhaps 400 feet above ground level. Cylindrical shape moving at about 100 m.p.h. or more. I gauged the speed from the fact that in took some 30 seconds to travel the 11 miles or more to a point off Selsey Bill.

Not a sound anywhere, for the gulls had vanished, to return immediately afterwards when I could compare the brilliant sunlight full on their white wings with the dull grey of this object in flight on that machine. The machine, if that is what it was, was clearly defined everywhere except for a slight hazy area underneath. A faint, wispy cloud was pouring out behind, but clearly defined as passing quite close to its stern. The object had no finsâor gondola, as with normal airships. It had already passed my centre of vision and moved swiftly away southward, turning a shade away out to sea, when I caught at that moment a brilliant flash of something.

"There was no one else to see it, except a house painter working away behind me, and he had his back to the sea. Later a courageous local and his wife came forward, telling a neighbour about a sighting to one month later, she and that a Farnham girl had reported a sighting to the local press at about the same time, so I was not the only one on that island to my left side, and so not have been visible as I walked down to the beach. Well, it might have been a new secret atomic-powered aircraft, but it was absolutely silent, and it was certainly real."

A well-known local figure and director of local firm, our informant stated that he was quite clear about the phenomenon yet, could offer no natural explanation.

Date and location: 20 Sep 65, Sussex, England

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Enjoyed our telephone conversations. Maybe the enclosed information will be of some help. I realize that most of the information is incomplete but Sunday night was nothing but confusion.

I will send you the Oklahoma Highway Patrol Log of what was reported by their unit. It is from my notes enclosed. The news papers give most of the information but not all. For additional information I have enclosed the names and address of the different news media in the Oklahoma City area that also were interested.

I am beginning to receive mail from my our members giving dates and observations. St. Petersburg July 27 & 28 the same objects sighted by many.

We investigated a report of fragments that came from a UFO over Texas. One enclosed. The Oklahoma Civil Defense (Director is friend) made the test. It was radioactive but too toxic to test. Will send you the spectrographic analysis. Taped interview with NBC radio news New York. Should be aired this week end.

Will keep you posted. Please let me know anything you can as soon as possible. I need if possible 100 sighting forms. (for the Oklahoma highway. Patrol and police observations. NOT the fun sighters.)

It is my opinion that many of the sightings in our area are stars and planes but NOT all of them. There maybe 25-50 good fact sightings. The others are all in my opinion sensation seekers.

Very truly yours,

Midwesterners Tell
Of Mystery Objects

OKLAHOMA CITY (UPI)âHundreds of UFO sightings, which have varied some police departments so much they have created general alarm, are being investigated by Air Force bases.

Typical of the reports were claims they saw stars or planets.

A 32-year-old Sioux City, Iowa high school English teacher said he saw a flashing object and that "anyone who would look at the sky would see their lights."

The teacher, who would not give his name, said the spotted the phenomenon when he and his wife were driving near their car. Sometimes the objects were described as flying saucers, sometimes as zigzagged slightly. It was reported in Los Angeles.

Naleen E. Malaby, former FAA Agency (FAA) said the crash of reports may signal a new "American mythology."

"Reports of such 'objects' have increased during August and September. It may be that the long, hot summer that was productive of the imagination," he said in Los Angeles.

Coupled with the Air Force's statement that most sightings were probably natural phenomena, some police departments so much alarm that some people took issue with the Air Force bases.

The Air Force contends most of the sightings were probably natural phenomena.

It was the fourth consecutive try to hear an airplane engine.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a small town or village landscape. The scene shows several buildings, some trees, and what looks like a utility pole in the foreground. The image has a grainy, vintage quality typical of mid-20th century photography. The buildings are clustered together, suggesting a residential or small town setting. The landscape appears to be somewhat sparse, with open areas between the structures. No text is visible in this image.

UFOs
(Continued From Page 1)

with calls from persons
sighting UFOs between 5:30
p.m. and 9:30 p.m.
The Cleveland County
sheriff's office and three of
its crew of investigators
cruised over the county
searching for the UFO about
9 p.m.

The three "sky watchers"
said the object gave off a
reddish glow. They said it
was traveling east and suddenly changed direction and
height.

The whole incident was
clouded with Monday when
Air Force officials gradually
proclaimed the everything
Sooners had seen amounted
to atmospheric conditions.

But no sooner had the Air
Force finished its "solution"
to the phenomenon than an
Oklahoma City expert pointed
out that the Pentagon had
made a mistake in its appraisal along with a prior
source of two.

It all started Saturday night
near Wynnewood when police
reported a UFO, which was
confirmed by radar at Tinker
Air Force Base and Carswell
Air Force Base, San Angelo.

Calls flooded in from eight
states, and included single
and multiple sightings from
throughout Oklahoma. But apparently, like Saturday night,
the Air Force was ready with
reports.

Sunday night the Tinker
Air Force Base security office
told the high-way Patrol four hours after
the first sightings that no
persons in Oklahoma and surrounding states had seen the
three days.

"It looked like a light
source. Dominantly white and
appeared to have a green
glow around it." Witnesses to
Hewes' viewing of the object
were six highway patrolmen
and a television cameraman.

The UFO also seemed to
be flashy, red, white and
blue lights, hovering over the
Oklahoma City area for about
an hour, Hewes said.

While others are curious
to know what or who's inside
the saucers, Hewes is a bit
more scientific about the recent blaze of unknown sky
travelers.

"They are propelled and were made of material and were made of is more
than we know," Hewes said.

tion in Carter, Murray, Garvin, McClain and Cleveland
Counties.

The project, which crosses
the Arbuckle Mountains, is
estimated at $36.2 million.
Two of the state's eight
highway districts will be
given no Interstate allocations for construction
sight.

The proposed Interstate
allocations are: district one,
$41,158,000; district two, $8,015,000; district three, $8,509,000; district four $11,116,000; district five,
$7,530,000; and district six,
$3,250,000.

Allocations for projects
other than Interstate are:
district one, $6,334,000; district two, $3,125,000; district
three, $4,392,000; district
four, $3,842,000; district
five, $4,728,000; district six,
$2,134,000; district seven,
$1,500,000; and district
eight, $3,123,000.

The Oklahoma County
projects, one Interstate and
two non-Interstate, are included in the 1967 program.

Paving

obligated in reference to paving for improvements at the
hospital site," Holoway
declared.

"We sold the five acres at a token price,"
Holoway said. "Certainly we were not positive of the price for paving," he said.

Jim Gregory, manager of
Atkinson's real estate interests, said, "The official plat
of the Reding Regional Community Center addition filed
June 7, 1963, shows the
same tract of land as the
Oklahoma City Planning
Commission's recommended
median strip on S. Douglas
as city park property."

"It was our understanding," he added, "that this
was one of the tracts that
were precedents under similar circumstances."

Youth
(Continued From Page 1)

So did a lot of other
Oklahomans who weren't
wishing, but just happened
to sky-gaze.

After waiting so long to
spot a UFO, Hewes first
reaction was amazement. "I
just felt a strange feeling
come over me, and found myself hoping it would come
closer.

"I guess I would have given
my eye teeth if I had landed
in front of me."

What Hewes saw is the
same or similar to objects
spotted by several thousand
persons in Oklahoma and surrounding states in the past
three days.

"It looked like a light
source. Dominantly white and
appeared to have a green
glow around it." Witnesses
were six highway patrolmen
and a television cameraman.

While others are curious
to know what or who's inside
the saucers, Hewes is a bit
more scientific about the
recent blaze of unknown sky
travelers.

"They are propelled and

than we know," Hewes said.

A woman who had just

because her young son had told
her a falsehood.

Figures 10 tip that tendency

money," one said. "It only
encourages children to become

"Yeah," the other one agreed,

It turns the parents into bank

Man Says He S[cut off]

By JIM KROUSE
Copyright 1965 by The Oklahoma
Journal Publishing Company

A trained Air Force weather observer using high-power telescope and camera tracked a UFO over Norman Sunday night an object he described as a "flying saucer."

Despite an official statement by the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Information that no officer backed up his contention with a thorough physical description of the UFOâthe only one received from hundreds of Oklahoma who made similar sightings from Shawnee to the greater Oklahoma City area.

The observer, who requested to remain anonymous due to the Air Force's position, said he spent about 9:30 p.m. Sunday, approximately from the northeast and "arctics" in a direct line to the southwest. He said the object was moving quite rapidly. We observed it a little less than five minutes before it went out of sight. It was about 22,000 to 25,000 feet at a 45-degree angle.

"It was shaped like a flying saucer, and through the 10-power binoculars took on the appearance of being quite large. There were two sets of revolving, pulsating lights, but no perceptive blinking that would distinguish," he said.

To guard against the possibility of letting their imaginations run away, they set up the 40-power telescope and "took a fix" on several points.

Elkin, North Carolina
21 September 1965

CLOSE SIGHTING IN NORTH CAROLINA #25. Nasal Abner of Elkin, North Carolina, had the most frightening experience of her life last September 21st. When the bedroom of her home was suddenly lit up, like broad daylight, a loud noise accompanied the light. She jumped out of bed and ran to the window, where she saw an object hanging in the air, "a little higher than a telephone pole would be."

The UFO looked like it was in two parts, both of them round. The bottom part was smaller and was a golden light, like a golden cartwheel spinning around and around. In the top part the lady could see windows, "shaped like egg cartons," all around the circumference, and there was a whitish glow coming out of them.

Mrs. Abner then ran to the front door, just in time to see the UFO flying away at great speed, making a loud whining noise of some sort. Her telephone rang; as well as several other people in the neighborhood heard the noise; but Mrs. Abner was the only person to see anything. (Winston-Salem Journal, 9/25/65.)

It's not very often that the universe's coincides its fantastic phenomenon to coincide with a fella's vocation. Hayden Hewes, a saucer enthusiast, the past six years of Monday morning were a thrill.

He's a young man who, for the past six years, has oriented his life to scientific research and study of unidentified flying objects.

Hewes personally paid the legislators in separate pivots in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

County Attorney Curtis P. Harris said Monday he may ask for a grand jury investigation into the matter and may be ready to ask Oklahoma County district court to help.

Harris said within the next few days he hopes to have preliminary investigation into the matter and may be ready to ask Oklahoma County district court.

House Speaker J. B. McSpadden and former Senate President Otto Tempel were named last week in a pleading filed in district court, as having received $20,000 each to lobby for the bill.

The pleading, filed in connection with the $2 million libel suit against the Oklahoma Publishing Co. by local oil man Jack Woosley, alleges Heavener attorney Whit Pate personally paid the legislators in separate pivots in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

Bureau Director Forrest Castle was named as the negotiator who arranged the deal between the legislators and eastern racing dog breeders.

If these charges are true and can be supported with evidence, the county will prosecute with all the vigor possible, "Harris said.

The county attorney said his and Hewes' investigation has brought more newspaper publicity last week and brought forward new evidence.

Investigation into the allegations began more than a year ago when former County Attorney James H. Harris received information from sources in Kansas City, Castle and Pate to Memphis late in 1959 to obtain $50,000 to pay the legislators.

Harrod was unable to give his evidence to a grand jury because the timing of several unexpected elections last fall forced the grand jury to be delayed.

First Night Color Shot
Of Flying Saucer Bared

Copyrighted 1965 by The
Oklahoma Journal Publishing Co.

At approximately 1:45 a.m.
on August 2, Alan Smith, 14,
standing in his back yard of
his Tulsa home, pointed his
small camera toward the
darkened sky and clicked the
shutter.

The image he recorded on
some 35mm color negative
film is being scientifically
studied by UFO researchers.

In one our sighting
his camera at an unidentified
flying object in the sky. He
and his father had observed
the UFOs August 1 and this
night were prepared.

The image is yet to be
analyzed to be the first color photo picture of what is commonly called a flying saucer.
The picture is eerie. The
consequences of the one-in-amillion shot are far reaching.

The negative shows a vividly, blue and whitish egg
shaped object. Protruding
from the sky. Protecting
fingers which many have
speculated may be the propulsion system. They could have
been something else.

The pictures was taken on a
night when a rash of UFOs
were sighted in Tulsa, Norman City, Norman and elsewhere throughout the west.

These were explained
away by the Air Force as
stars, planes, light reflections and even airplanes moving in the sky.

Alan said the second night
he and his family were ready.
He had loaded his official
boy scout camera (620) with
Kodacolor X high speed film.

'Saucer Sighted'

TEXARKANA, Ark. (Staff) - A red, yellow and blue object which "seemed to alternate colors" has been spotted here by several persons. Reporting Friday that it was sighted by Mrs. J. L. Moore and her sister, Mrs. Louise Paul, it was about one-third as large as the sun, Mrs.

At approximately 1:43 a.m. on August 2, Alan Smith, 16, was standing in the back yard of his Tulsa home, poised camera in hand, scanning the darkened sky and clicked the shutter.

The image he recorded, a color negative may become one of the most famous photographs of our age.

Young Smith was accompanied by his camera and an unidentified companion. They were prepared.

The image is believed to be the first color picture of a flying saucer. It shows a disc-shaped object, taken with a 620 Brownie camera and Kodacolor X film.

The picture was taken on the night when a rash of UFO sightings were reported in Tulsa, OK.

You Can Help

Here's how you can help solve the flying saucer riddle in the United States:

1. If you have a camera, keep it loaded with color film.
2. If you see an unidentified flying object in the sky, shoot a picture of it.
3. Send your negatives to a reputable newspaper or magazine immediately.

Members of the family said
they could not see the definition of lights as it appears
in the camera. However, it
indicated, experts say, that
the camera was able to pick
up something that the
human eye was unable to see.

Atmospheric conditions
that might have helped a dull
picture were a clear sky and
stars.

The Smiths were first interviewed by Jim Krouse,
aviation editor of the
Journal, who heard of the
picture through a Tulsa newspaper. Other interviews were
conducted by Bill Moody, Ft.
Smith, Ark., correspondent;
Atkinson, publisher, News
and Cliff King, photographers.

King and Gumm, chief
photographers, have shot color pictures of airplanes,
stars, etc. In an effort to
duplicate the image in some

object an arbitrary size of 50
feet diameter. Measuring the
image size on the film
(3.9mm) the object would
have to have been less than
a mile distant from the
camera.

"Measuring the density of
the image on the film,"
Gumm continued, "the
brightness of the object would
be relatively twice that of a
full moon."

King shot another roll
of the same color film
with the same type of camera, standing in the boy's back
yard, at approximately the
same time of night.

This was done, he explained, to eliminate the possibility that the boy's camera
lens had a flaw or that a
light reflection was being
bounced off of some earthly
object.

The extra proved fruitless.
The airplane picture looks
like another light. The
color negatives shot by King
turned up with no image or
reflection. There was no flaw
in the camera that could be
detected by Journal photographers. The image on the
original negative was not
closed.

Alan, a newspaper carrier
boy for the Tulsa Tribune,
said he had paid little attention to flying saucer reports in the past and had
been surprised by the attention to newspaper stories about
saucers in the past.

The family is a typical
middle - class group. They
live in a modest home and
were contacted very thoroughly first.

Journal editors asked all
persons who personally had
seen flying objects in the
past to communicate by letter with the newspaper.

This information, complete with descriptions, etc.,
will be sent on to military
authorities in an effort to
help determine origin of the
object and its significance.
"In the future, we ask
anyone who sees a flying
saucer or object in the sky
to call the Journal," they
said.

He exposed only one negative, he explained later, because he couldn't see to wind the camera again.

The family waited 10 to 12 days to get the film developed for normal commercial processing. This was done at the Camera Store, 9148 Detroit, Tulsa, for processing.

When we got the film back, "I was struck immediately by the picture," Alan said. "There was nothing in Alan's prints of the flying object."

Then started looking through the film company had not printed some of the negatives. When they did, the object appeared in one of the three or four colors, he said.

"We took it back to the film company and had them make an enlargement of that negative," Alan said.

The letter, sent to Hayden Hewes, director of Interplanetary Flying Objects, Oklahoma City, is reproduced at the request of the public.

Both men are experienced, highly - skilled professional photographers. Guinn has worked around the world and is known as an expert in his field.

Cumm reported that the boy Scout camera used to shoot the picture has a fixed focus lens with a shutter speed of 1-50th of a second and a relative aperture of f8.

The film was Kodacolor X having a relative speed of ASA 64. Approximate local length of the camera lens is 2Â¼ inches or more technically, 50mm.

"Measuring the density of the image on the film," Cumm said, "another roll of the same type color film, in the same camera, was full moon."

Now It's Saucers

By the State Staff

Sightings of unidentified flying objects continued Tuesday for the fourth straight night in Oklahoma, but the day's most spectacular sighting was reported in South America.

Observers in Curitiba, Brazil, reported seeing a squadron of 18 flying saucers flying over northern Brazil's Parana state.

From Santiago, Chile, came a report of a flying saucer which landed but took off again when a group of people moved toward it.

The highway patrol reported Tuesday night unidentified objects were seen in the skies over Erick, Lawton

and in the Turley area near Tulsa.

Several reports were received of sightings in the Oklahoma City area.

A many-surfaced aluminum disc, found Monday night on the D. W. Meade farm 314 miles southeast of Elk City, was an item of some mystery Tuesday in Durant.

Meade turned the welded disc over to Lloyd Nabors, who said he did not know what it is or where it came from. He said, "A verbal description of the object," and the "ALCLAD 2024" imprinted on its side brought tentative

Identification from officials at Perrin Air Force Base, Denton, Texas. They said it is likely a piece launched with large weather balloons. They withheld positive identification until they see the object.

Meade found the "thing" in his pasture Monday. He said it definitely was not there Sunday.

Unidentified flying objects were sighted in the Bryan County area Sunday night â glowing red and dimming just above tree-top level, according to witnesses.

"Maybe Mars has an ALCOA plant there, too," one wisecre commented.

The first of objects over Brazil was first seen by two little girls. They saw four moving over the horizon in daylight at Astorga, about 250 miles west of Sao Paulo. They called three neighbors, who reported seeing 11 others in formation. They were described as silvery with a greenish light shining from the top.

John Stark, 852 NW 6, Moore, reported he watched some object with a reddish light on top and a white light on the bottom hover at what he estimated as 2,000 feet above Will Rogers World Airport around 9 p.m. Tuesday.

"I couldn't see the shape of it," he said. "but I could see it had two distinct sources of light. It kinda shakes you up; it's no laughing matter."

Stark said he called his wife over when he had the object lined up between two houses. It hovered there, he said, as lights from a plane passed at the same level, then took off and disappeared.

Stark said the lights on the object were "six or eight times brighter than a star." Stark, a pre-dental student at Central State College, Edmond, is a sports writer for The Daily Oklahoman.

Flying objects, the Oklahoma City police switchboard glowed brightly with numerous reported sightings, nearly from the west side of town.

One youth reported seeing an object rise either from Lake Hefner or its shoreline. Another reported seeing two round objects circling about a mile from his home at 1044 SW 48. He said the objects flashed red lights and headed south at a high rate of speed.

Joe Spitalie, 11, said, by his parents and sister watched a bright orange object that "looked like a ball of fire" appear on the edge of the city. He said the UFO first headed south, then it appeared to reverse as it "just zoomed by."

Another resident saw a bright blue object "with a tall" about halfway up in the sky from his home at NW Hill and Shartel. He said he watched it for about two minutes at about 8:50 p.m.

W. R. Bill Clark, 2908 NW Western, said he and his wife watched three separate UFO's at about 8:30 p.m. He said one headed northwest to northwest on the east side of the city, and a short time later one headed in the opposite direction on the west side. A third, he said, moved straight west.

He said all three appeared to be red and traveled at a terrific rate of speed, taking only a minute or two to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon.

THEORY OFFERED

Mystery Objects
There All Along?

Look at the sky long enough and you'll see â or imagine you see â all sorts of things, particularly if you're not accustomed to sky-watching.

That's why so many people are seeing unidentified flying objects, explains Dale Johnson, director of the Kirkpatrick Planetarium.

He says the natural phenomenon which cause such illusions are present all the time, but usually so unnoticed.

"People don't pay much attention to the sky. But, when you have a lot of people gazing skyward, they'll see rings they never paid any attention to before."

Johnson believes that in a great majority of cases, the unidentified objects people notice are bright stars that they have not noticed before.

Also, certain atmospheric conditions, such as "scintillation," make distant objects appear to move around or change color.

This is also the time of year, explains Johnson, when there are an unusually large number of meteors about.

"The next strong meteor shower will be August 10 and it will be interesting to see if we get a large number of UFO reports at that time."

Johnson believes many of the UFOs may be such planets as Mars, Venus, Saturn, Antares or Vega. All appear much brighter than other stars this time of year.

Another bright planet, Jupiter, is not visible this time of year.

"I'm not saying people are not seeing what they think they are seeing," he points out. "I believe they are simply seeing a phenomenon â one they haven't noticed before, one which creates some kind of optical illusion."

Since the current rash of UFO sightings started, Johnson has observed the skies several nights hoping to spot some unusual object.

Many Report
Flying Objects

Despite Air Force claims that Oklahomans were not daily "seeing stars," reports continued to flood in of unidentified flying object sightings Tuesday.

One report even had a UFO landing near Justin, Texas, 11 miles from Denton.

Other reports had green UFO's, red UFO's and brilliant white UFO's zipping, hovering and streaking through unusually clear summer skies.

Hundreds of reports filtered into the Highway Patrol, police departments, Tinker Air Force Base, the U.S. Weather Bureau and news media for the third straight night.

Still, the Air Force stuck to its released announcement from Washington, D.C., that there were no observations of a Delta meteor shower occurring from July 26 through August 2.

The Air Force statement also said that during the past several days, atmospheric conditions and wind speeds were favorable to "scintillation," the natural phenomenon that causes stars to appear to twinkle or distort objects viewed through layers of the atmosphere.

But, people still reported seeing strange, unidentified things.

In Fort Smith, Ark., two high school students, Ronald Coble, 17, and Jack Clark, 17, both of Van Buren said three UFO's streaked overhead. Five minutes later they saw a fourth.

In Texas, two sheriffs reportedly collected reports of an object that looked like a magnesium touch near Justin. The men spotted it while on patrol near Wagle Mountain Lake.

Peace officers swarm into the area to investigate.

About the same time, scores of residents in Fort Worth and Denton told of observing a bright light as it streaked northwest across the sky.

Telephone callers asked Norman officials about a white glow which they said, appeared to touch ground in the Justin vicinity.

Boyd said the object appeared to move forward, backward, then up and down.

Robert Bennett, a Highway Patrolman on duty at Tishomingo, said he sighted a "green UFO" traveling northeast at high altitude.

Jim Beck, said he verified reports from several residents that a "solid red globe" was flying over the city.

Hayden Hewes, the 21-year-old director of a scientific research organization, International Unidentified Flying Objects, said Tuesday morning he is still at work plotting the course of the sightings.

Hewes said sources he has talked to in the Air Force are still investigating the reports.

Noting there were probably a "lot of sensation seekers," Hewes added Monday night, Hewes added that some reports may be fabricated. Many people's imagination is more vivid at night, he said. Of further interest, he said, and then did have one radar (fix for 40 minutes), he said. However, he did not deviate at all.

"You can't dismiss the fact that so many reliable persons have reported sightings," he said, noting that some patrolmen and highway workers used to seeing the stars. They would recognize an object out of the ordinary.

Meanwhile, 3d Officer at Tinker, said he expects reports to continue pouring in until the meteor shower.

And, at Van Buren, Ark., police report an unidentified line-door ghost with no head or hands, has been reported by several adults and children roaming along a river bank.

a different display at Berchem on the

appearance of a very luminous ball of

a great speed in the form of a parabolic arc. It was following a course from North East to South
West, in relation to the local horizon. The sky was partly cloudy.

Next day, M. Maurice Hoornaert's

So the air intelligence crews were ordered to collect, correlate, and analyze the reports. One of the first officers saddled with this unwelcome chore was Maj. Gen. Robert N. Stull, USAF, who has just completed a tour of duty as director of intelligence of SAC and reports to the Pentagon this month for duty as director of plans, USAF. He was then a Lieutenant Colonel; his progress has not been matched by those seeking to explain the relatively small number of cases in which the object is really unidentifiable.

Southward were at first regarded as evidence that the Russians had taken over the Peenomunde experiments and were developing certain Nazi projects for their own use. Soon these gave way to "flying saucer" reports and from Stockholm to Los Alamos, El Paso, and Oak Ridge. Nervous officials admitted these sensitive sites were too important to permit any possible reconnaissance to go undetected.

In the majority of cases, there are explanations, and they do not involve visitors from another planet, or even another continent. If you have seen what you think was a UFO, you are not likely to accept any of these explanations. I find, like most people, you see only what is normally there when you look skyward, these explanations may look like large stars or small moons.

ONE - Most common daytime UFO is the balloon. The great balloons carrying scientific instruments rise to fantastic heights, and in the hours near dawn or sunset can take on brilliant hue. They sometimes take on odd shapes, too, because they are made of transparent or reflective film. This a reflection from the near outer surface is noted with a reflection from the far inner surface. I have seen a perfect example of the "flying saucer" shape formed this way - (?) - and have even seen it "launch" something toward earth. The instrument pack drops clear, followed by a long, slender white tube as it unravels into the familiar shape until near the earth, out of sight of distant observers. Balloons may look like large stars or small moons in the predawn sky, long before they are high enough to catch the sunlight long before full daylight.

TWO - Most common night-flying UFO is the ordinary, common airplane. Many through flights now pass over mid-America so high that all sound is carried far downwind, and observers directly below hear nothing, but see the running lights. Depending on the angle, a craft running lights are seen at one time, as a rule, and these "by formation." Some blink or and off, others are steady. Some planes have brilliant blue-white strobe

Air Force Investigating

Sky Sights Excite Big Area

By Jack Taylor

Reports of unidentified flying objects swamped civilian and military authorities in at least four states before dawn Monday.

Scores of sightings were reported in Oklahoma, many in the Oklahoma City area.

Air force officials at Tinker AFB said they are investigating and will follow normal procedure.

The weather bureau at Tulsa said it tracked UFO's on its telescopic visual tracking unit and that they moved precisely with the stars.

A spokesman explained the night was exceptionally clear and some of the bright or stars "rose" in the sky and tended to give off strange lightning-like or horizon.

Sightings were reported in a steady stream between 8 p.m. Sunday and 3 a.m. Monday in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Kansas.

Radar at weather bureaus and air force bases scattered throughout the area detected some of the sightings.

One civilian UFO enthusiast said he received reports from counterparts that sightings ranged over a 9-state area from Chickasha, Shawnee, Tulsa, Purcell, Norman, Slicker, Chandler, Guthrie, Cushing, Guymon, Moore, Oklahoma City, and others.

The deluge of reports is the heaviest in the 17-year recorded history of UFO's, it was said.

Oklahoma City police said they received numerous reports during the night.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol headquarters reported a similar coverage and a one point three dispatchers couldn't handle all the reports.

Reports of UFO's poured in from Pecos, Monahans, Odessa, Midland, Fort Worth, Canyon and Dalhart, Texas; Hobbs, Clovis and Artesia, N. M.; Oxford, Belle Plaine, Wichita, Liberal and Wichita, Kan.

In Oklahoma, they came (See FLYING-Page 5)

An air force spokesman for the Oklahoma City Air Defense Command refused to confirm or deny a report that a plane was sent after one of the UFO's.

Flying Objects Seen
In Four-State Area

(Continued From Page 1)

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the weather bureau tracked several UFOs at altitudes of 6,000 to 9,000 feet.

Tinker Air Force Base radar at Oklahoma City tracked one on its radar screen at an undisclosed altitude at about 22,000 feet. A Tinker spokesman declined comment, however.

The patrol said officers in three different cruisers reported watching the objects fly in a diamond-shaped formation for about 30 minutes in the Shawnee area.

The UFOs were described as changing color from red to white to blue-green.

Wichita dispatcher said: "I was disbelieving. But I saw it something up there tonight and so did others."

The weather bureau and McConnell Air Force Base said it tracked one of the objects south and west of Wellington at an altitude of about 22,000 feet, down to 4,000 feet.

Hayden Ewers, director of Inter-Agency Investigations of Unidentified Objects at the private UFO Investigations Agency headquarters, said he watched one of the objects over Oklahoma City, said he has received at least 50 to 100 reports from associates. He said he talked with Wright-Patterson AFB and was told as soon as UFO headquarters there had drawn a conclusion, the public would be informed.

In the past, the air force has said signals, jet exhaust, kites, meteors, and missiles.

As of July 20, the air force said 9,127 sightings since 1947, with no investigations to indicate the unidentified objects came from outer space.

Flying Objects Zooming Over State

By BILL STEWART
A rash of unidentified flying objects, confirmed near Tulsa by military radar and Air Force Base, "occurred" Sunday night, it was learned today.

The first report, at 8:40 p.m., led to a series of sightings that ranged from Tulsa to Shawnee-Chandler area.

One sighting, by Sherry Hudnall, 222 SE 16, 16, and Maryleth Tucker, 16, trailing red, white and blue light, was tracked on two radar screens early Sunday and then reappeared 29 miles south of Tulsa.

First sightings were confirmed by the base security office, identicals were made by radar tracks.

Homer Brisco said "we had one call, one had 100."

Most of the first reports were from the Shawnee-Chandler area, especially in the Seminole area.

The initial military radar tracking was of four objects flying at 22,000 feet. Later the Air Force said only that it would investigate the matter.

But now sightings in that area were not long in coming, again including the Tulsa area.

Patrol dispatcher Jim West also had reports from the west side of the city.

Most of the reports indicated the objects were generally traveling toward the south and east of the city.

2504 SW 54 Place, turned out to be a particular flare which police confiscated.

The radar approach confirmed the tower at Tinker, using four radar scopes with a range of 40 miles, reported the height of the local sightings.

City police dispatcher Lt. Hurrell said "I don't know what it could be - an airplane or balloons - but there's something there."

West also had reports from other parts of the state.

Most of the reports indicated the objects were barely traveling toward the south and east of the city, with the reported objects generally red, white and blue.

Shawnee-Chandler area. At one time four objects were reported stationary over the area, apparently with a "straggler" leading into the area from Tecumseh.

City dispatcher Brisco said most of the local calls came from persons in the south and east of the city.

cratic and Republican leaders at the White House last Wednesday morning.

"Sen. Mansfield never mentioned reserves and it was not in any of his discussions," Johnson said. "I'm just going to answer your questions and give you the facts. Nothing to provoke any fight. No bloody noses. We're just going to answer your questions and give you the facts."

The President said that most of the people he deals with in private conferences - and he said he deals with a couple of hundred, including the nation's governors - have respect for his confidence.

"But once in a while," he continued, "an individual, or a bitter partisan has to play a little politics."

The president has been careful not to criticize Republicans since he moved into the White House.

"Is this going to throw a shadow on future bipartisan consultation?"

"No," Johnson said. "I'm not going to provoke any fight. No bloody noses. We're just going to answer your questions and give you the facts."

Objects
(Continued From Page 1)

A local photographer Jim Swanck sighted one object, red and green in color, very high traveling west over U.S. Highway 50 near Straw Road. He said it could have been a plane but "there was absolutely no sound." Highway Patrol confirmed that at the same instant they and one sighting at Harrah and two from Norman.

But the confusion was not without humor. The Highway Patrol shares a state teletype wire with the U.S. Weather Bureau, which dispatches West said, "Has its comedians."

At one point, with the reports jamming the wire, the weathermen cut in with "Dick, there goes another one."

Moments later they added a postscript to West's report with "I think I go to the funny house."

But shortly after 11 the patrol tower conceded they had far too many "sightings" to get all on the wire.

Then came a plea for a summary. The note was signed "Buck Rogers."

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?--Now We Wonder

[Continued from Page One]

Though the arc facing this the objects are stars, the investigation is continuing, they said.

Prof. H. S. Mendenhall, OSU mathematics professor and astronomer, favors the scientific view that they were related lights of some kind.

He said such illusions probably are caused by an unstable atmosphere, which speeds out the light into a spectrum of its basic colors, acting like a prism.

He said the prism effect could account for lights reported in the skies.

He speculated the sightings were meteorites, cars, clouds, balloons, "or anything but interplanetary ships or travelers from outer space."

Dr. Walter Sauder, meteorology professor and director of OU's atmospheric research laboratory, declined to speculate. "I have no idea what these things are," he said, "and I'm not going to stick my neck out and guess. It just sounds stupid."

Dr. Tom J. Love Jr., director of the school of mechanical engineering and aerospace studies at OU said he is certain some of the objects seen were aircraft and other optical phenomena.

Police departments over the state were swamped with telephone calls from persons reporting strange objects in the sky.

Bethany police officer Jim McGill Monday evening spotted two "sources" while he his car parked near War Acres police by a boy and his father at NW 36 and Hammond. The object changed colors, red, white and green.

War Acres policeman Larry Wilson said he watched an unidentified object "glide" near El Reno late Sunday night until 5 a.m. Monday.

Five boys reported in Oklahoma City that at dusk they saw a round, shiny object without wings close to the ground in the 600 block on NW 6.

Two Oklahoma City boys, Robert Colbert, 11, and Charles Dellard, 11, at the Dellard home, 512 NW 41, saw a red light glowing on and off. They said the object was a big "oval-like" thing lying to the north and then it stopped.

Hobart Police Chief Doss Kutch said there was no question of an UFO settlement here. He checked after receiving a report and said he and his wife saw the bright object.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper Obert Bennett reported sighting a green object north of Tishomingo traveling "high up." He said a plane came close to the object.

Several Woodward citizens reported seeing a solid red globe flying over Woodward at 10:30 p.m.

The Norman police department said a Cleveland County resident, Charles Boyd, reported from "the scene of an UFO" and that his report was confirmed by four persons at the scene. The group viewed through a tripod-mounted power telescope a white globe, 30 to 40 feet in diameter, 50 degrees above the horizon southeast of Norman. They said the object appeared to move forward, backward and then up and down.

A Cicero, Ill., visitor, Ron Buscemi, at the home of his uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Taylor, at Blackard saw a strange object for the second time Monday.

Three radio club members near "spotting" the Norman police department Monday night they had sighted an unidentified object northeast of Norman's Alex Westheimer Field.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?--Now We Wonder

By Jim Jackson and Ivy Coffey
of the State Staff

Stars, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions were the official Air Force explanation Monday at a rush of sightings of unidentified flying objects Sunday night throughout Oklahoma and into neighboring states.

Picture on Page 3

The jets in the sky were continuing.

The objects, sometimes described as glowing lights, were spotted in Norman, Blanchard, Oklahoma City and other parts of the state, Kansas and New Mexico.

The lights were reported over a period of several hours and the objects varied in shape and color.

In Cushing, J. C. Knoch, seed fertilizer dealer, and his son, Ricky, 11, saw what they described as a large circular object flying over northeast Cushing at 12:50 p.m. Monday in full daylight.

Knoch, in the process of building a new furniture store, was looking out the window of the old store when he spotted the object described as having black stripes or black streaks and silver on the bottom side. It almost hurt his eyes to look at it, he said.

Four boys in Oklahoma City reported seeing approximately the same type of thing at 3:50 p.m. Monday at 15. They said it hovered and was striped and quivered, headed east across the sky and disappearing into the clouds.

The Air Force, in its announcement from Washington, said initial study of the flood of sighting reports indicated the sightings were "astronomical in nature."

"The objects observed may have been the planet Jupiter or stars Rigel Capella, Betelgeuse or Aldebaran which were visible," the Air Force statement continued. "At the time of the reported sightings, the azimuth and elevation of the reported sightings supports the preliminary conclusion."

The Air Force denied an unconfirmed report that the objects had been tracked by radar and denied that any planes were scrambled in an attempt to intercept or identify the UFOs.

The Air Force statement also pointed out that temperature, distribution and variant wind speeds both Sunday and Monday over the great plains from Northern Texas to Wyoming were favorable to "scintillation."

The term was described as a natural phenomenon.

Mexico

Failing lights and Aerial shocks
This preview account of the 1965 scene in Latin
America closes with an important incident in
Mexico, one which readers will be quick to
associate in their minds with an event some six
weeks later in the United States.

The newspaper Ultima Hora of September 24
told how, on the previous evening, the important
town of Cuernavaca, 75 km. southeast of Mexico
City, suffered three hours of electric power and
lights failure. During this luminous night, an
objectâwas photographed, and the picture appeared along with the accounts of several witnesses
who included the Governor of the City, Emilio
Rivera Palacios. He, and other officials, were at a
private cinema show when the light and power
supply failed; as they emerged from the cinema,
the whole party saw the UFO. The intense light
from this object lit up the valley around Cuernavaca.

Shortly afterward, Cuauhtemoc Betanzos, a
pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO over
Lake Tequesquitengo. Although on a routine
flight from Mexico City to Acapulco, he attempted
to approach the object, but it caused his aircraft to
suffer a series of "crazy and fearful shocks".

Gorseinon cylinder

The South Wales Evening Post of September 28 published a letter from Mr. K. G. Davies of Gorseinon telling of a daylight sighting by his brother Michael (14) at 12.35 p.m. on September 25. According to the letter, Michael was walking home, but stopped a moment through a break in low clouds he saw a huge object with a long dark rear and a bright companion object.

Two parallel cylinder-shaped black marks ran the length of the squarish underside of the machine. Three were in wings, and the general colour was silver-grey. No other details were known to the Davies added the craft, but their mother heard, and remembered about the peculiar engine noise.

New Comet
Promises
Big Show

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 2 (JP)âAstronomers are predicting a spectacular celestial show later this month from a newly discovered comet.

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory said yesterday the tail of comet Ikeya-Seki may stretch into the sky higher than 100 million miles. The comet is due Dec. 20, then appears to move slowly across the sky.

DR. FRED Whipple, observatory director and chief of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, said the eastern part of the country probably will see the comet and its long tail, "close in the sky" near the sun.

The comet named after two Japanese who discovered it less than two weeks ago is tentatively identified as a "family of sun grazing" comets.

Dr. Whipple said these past sun-grazing comets have produced striking astronomical displays.

HE SAID comets are "dirty snowballs." The comet normally made up of particles blown out of the sun.

At present, the comet can be seen through telescopes and is continuing to be traced even in the southeastern sky about two hours before sunrise.

THE SMITHSONIAN'S notebook says the comet is approaching the sun, making a spectacular display and may be small but bright.

24 September 1965

Mystery Space Ship Is
Too Fast For Z-Car

A COUNTY POLICE SQUAD CAR was called to Ratcliffe College last night to investigate an unidentified flying object.

It was a star that had never budged, but when I looked up it was moving.

Meteors

The four of us watched it a few minutes and then it disappeared.

The four members of the kitchen staff at Ratcliffe College who claim they saw a mystery object in the sky last night are (left to right) Michael Barber, Paul Dalton, Denis O'Connor and Michael Lynch.

Shortly afterwards the driver of the car said he looked up and saw the object moving slowly in the sky.

Mr. Paul Delow, second chef at the college was walking up the drive when he happened to look up and saw the object.

The object was seen from the college and also on the catering staff of the college.

At first I thought it was Jupiter. At first I imagined it was a star.

Newsman Photographs UAO

On the night of September 30, 1965, Ken Skinner, photographer for the Norwich (Connecticut) Bulletin, spotted a UAO and photographed it. Skinner claimed the object seemed to change color as he watched it move about for several minutes. "It was like a brilliant light built in the center, then a glow all around it," Skinner said. At various times it looked bluish-green, then orange, grey and blue, Skinner reported.

Although the object seemed to be very high in the sky it was much larger than a star and at one point it moved across the face of the moon, creating an effect something like an eclipse, he told Associated Press. Skinner said he had a drink before making the sighting. "But, I feel like one now."

The photograph has been examined by our photo analyst, John Hopf, and is considered to be authentic.

'Ball Of Fire' Seizes Off More Saucer Reports

A "ball of fire" sighted overhead between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday set-off a wave of flying saucer reports in Lebanon and other Pennsylvania communities.

A spokesman at the Allegheny Observatory near Pittsburgh told United Press International the object was "probably a meteor" but persons who saw it disagreed among themselves.

Reports first came to the Daily News from residents in Jonestown and Rockwood who said they had sighted the ball-like object which appeared to identify themselves.

Mrs. Clyde Campbell, Lebanon RD 5, was one of the callers who did not identify herself. Sue said she had been driving home about 8:35 p.m. when she and her husband saw a "round ball of green fire" in the North Lebanon Township sky.

Chief William Kimmel also reported seeing the phenomenon but found nothing when they went to investigate.

The CD Center Called

(Continued on Page Two)

At the Center in the Municipal Building said eight calls came in to that center between 9:00 and 10:43 p.m.

The U. S. Weather Bureau at the Harrisburg - York State Airport said the object was seen in many calls from persons who said they saw a "brilliant walk light" in the heavens.

Residents of Warren, Pa., in the western portion of the state, reported that an unexplained explosion occurred about the same time that a bright light appeared in the sky. The explanation reportedly rattled home and buildings and damaged a good of telephone calls to local and newspaper offices.

Authorities in Warren today are reportedly attempting to trace the origin of the blast and determine its cause.

At the same time, pilots of two airlines flying over New York State also reported seeing a brilliant light near the campus of the state planes.

At Warren, Borough Patrolman William Zerbe reported the Associated Press that he saw the light and heard the explosion.

People came running out of their houses, he said. "The light was so bright they could see it through their doors."

Meteorite Flash
Believed Seen

WARREN, Pa. (AP) - An unusually bright light, flashed across the sky over a wide area of western Pennsylvania last night, about the same time, this community was jarred by a rumbling explosion.

Residents and police said the light was believed to be that of a meteorite.

Warren police received several calls after the light and explosion throughout town.

William Zane, a Warren newspaper patrolman, said he was riding a patrol car at the time.

"I saw a flash of light," he said. "I drove about two or three blocks and heard the explosion. People came running out of their houses. I pulled to the curb, and they told me that a noise came their windows and rattled their doors."

Telephone conversation between Mr Terry Kelly of the Dayton Daily News on 29 Sep 65 with Mrs Stancomb (TDN). He had checked with the police department at Warren Pennsylvania. They verified the time of the meteor observation as 0855p=EDT.

The information presented here
comes from telegraphic information relayed into the Oklahoma
Highway Patrol Communications
Center by the Oklahoma Patrol Command, Oklahoma, from various
highway patrol headquarters over
the state. This information was then
relayed to the Weather Wire teletype system and fed to both wire
services as well as all major newspapers, television and radio stations
across the state of Oklahoma.

The first message came in on July 31st "3:52 P.M. The message went like this: "At approximately 1:30 A.M. on July 31st, a Wayne, wood (Oklahoma) police officer Lewis Sikes, observed an object in the sky at approximately 10,000 feet about five miles northeast of Wynnewood emitting a red, blue and white light. The officer could hear no engine noise whatsoever. The object appeared to hover in the one spot and the officer observed it for 45 minutes before reporting it to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol Communication Tower at Elmore, Tinker Field was advised of the information and they made a radar check and came up with a fix at the location giving 8,000 feet."

At 8:49 other government installations as to air traffic within the area given None was reported. At this time Caswell Air Force Base aimed their radar at the same location and came up with the same fix as Tinker. Both of the bases tracked the object. It is pointed out that this was the first time from both radar scopes. It was picked up again just a few minutes later and tracked to a location 29 miles south of Tinker Field at which time

it was lost again and not relocated.
When the object was first located in
the vicinity of Wayne, Oklahoma,
passing in the vicinity of Wayne,
wood at 5,000 feet but the sighting
could not make visual contact with
the object. As of now said object has
not been resighted nor is there any
other information available as to the
nature of it. Authority: Oklahoma
Highway Patrol Tower and Tinker
Air Force Base, Oklahoma.

This was the first of the reports.
It was the only one the patrol received on Saturday, July 31st, 1965.
Sunday, August 1st, 1965, was a different story. At 9:19 P.M. August 1, 1965, the following message went out from the highway patrol headquarters Continental Flying Objects (APRO) representative at IOUFO learned about the sighting.

"Since 8:00 P.M. date, the tower
has received in the neighborhood of
25 to 30 visual sightings, many by
police officers and highway patrol
troopers of various unidentified flying objects from the Purcell area
through Wayne, Dibble, Cement,
Chandler and back south through
Meeker and Shawnee.

Three Shawnee officers and their
captain have four of the objects in
sight at this time. Also another has
crept up from the south of Tecumseh and is apparently going to
fly directly over Shawnee. The sighting is of four objects varying in
a reddish color and varying to a
white and blue luster. Shawnee reports the objects seem to be flying
four to a formation in a diamond-type formation.

Tinker Air Force Base has had
from one to four of them on radar
at a time, and they advise they
flying very high, at approximately
22,000 feet, which seems to coincide with the visual sightings, all of
which are very high in the sky.

Although the security officer at Tinker Field reports he has been swamped with calls this past hour from people reporting UFOs."

The following was advised: Police Department, they advise Charles Boyd, of Cleveland County, Norman, just called in on a citizens band and has confirmation by four other people at the scene of a UFO.

Also, Shawnee P.D. advised he has had approximately thirty calls reporting four or five flying objects which appear to hover. These are the same which natives from Shawnee. The people calling are not making any conventional noise such as an aircraft does, but rather make a humming noise. There were four objects, green in color at approximately four thousand feet, estimated by a private plane which observed the objects, and they are traveling slowly at about one mile inter-

The night of August 5th marked
the conclusion of reports of UFO
sightings in the vicinity of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.

On Thursday, August 5th, a fruit
stand employee reported to the Department of Public Safety that a
motorist stopped at the stand located
in the northeast part of Oklahoma
City to buy some fruit. The motorist
said as he was approaching Oklahoma City from the west on U.S. 66
she saw a UFO flying slowly over a
pasture. She said it was silver in color with orange stripes on it and it
seemed to be spinning like a top.
She said it was approximately 300
feet high and about the size of a
washub. She made the sighting of
the bowl-shaped object at about
10:00 A.M.

At 8:44 P.M. on August 5th, the
following message went out on the

Here is the text from the document:

Two Oklahoma City girls reported seeing a flare in the southwest part of the City.

Mary Beth Tucker, 16, of 4504 SW 54 Pl., said, "We saw a flare. It was white. We were driving along and saw it. We thought it was dying. We were on SW 44 just off Walker. It looked like it was over T. H. 35."

Her companion, Sherry R. Furtado, 13, of 322 SE 19, said, "It scared us to death." Goodwump were all over.

A small white parachute carrying a burnt out flare was brought to Oklahoma City police headquarters about 11 p.m. Little had told police that a flare had told police from the skies and land on S. Shields.

A little excitement turned to chuckles at headquarters when the parachute was discovered to be a crudely made floater apparently constructed from something that resembled a woman's white scarf.

About six white strings was a heavy object that resembled a well-worn cigar butt.

Officers, searching their heads, said it really was the remains of a flare.

But no one anywhere had courage enough even to hint there were any little green men connected with the whole thing.

The image shows a person in a law enforcement uniform, wearing sunglasses and a cap, standing in a pose with one hand on their hip.

The caption reads: "From the heavens, though probably from a standard earth-type plane, came this crudely-built flare parachute Sunday night in the midst of dozens of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in the city area. The chute, held by officer Richard Boyd, was spotted floating down near SE 53 and Shields, by Doyle Pate, 1313 SW 38."

Police in three southwestern New Mexico cities rejected reports of objects in the sky. Witnesses said they chased color from white to orange.

New Mexico sightings were reported at Hobbs, Carlsbad and Artesia City.

In Bartlesville, a caller told police he saw what appeared to be either a plane on fire going down southwest of Bartlesville or a large fighter.

A Del City resident reported he saw an object move east to west across the sky, charging from red to white and back to red. He said it took about a minute and a half for it to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon.

Polices in three southwest New Mexico cities reported bright objects in the sky. Witnesses said they changed color from orange.

New Mexico sightings were reported at Hobbs, Carlsbad and Artesia City.

In Barlesville, a caller told police he saw what appeared to be a large object going down southwest on a large meteror.

A Del City resident reported he saw an object move easily in the sky, changing from red to white and back to red. He said it took about a minute and a half for it to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon.

First sightings report Sunday night was from the area between Purcell and Norman. Officers, however, could not verify any moving objects in the sky. But the Evening Star was unusually brilliant.

In the midst of all the influx of UFO reports, some wit tapped out his sentiments on the highway patrol weather bureau-news room wire: "I think I go to bed."

Sunday night's reports followed an early Saturday and Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Lewis Sikes, on night police duty in Wynnewood, watched what he had flashing red, white and blue lights and described it as moving about 10,000 feet northeast of town.

Sky Objects
Excite Region
By Jack Taylor

Reports of unidentified flying objects swamped four states before dawn Monday.

Sightings were reported in Oklahoma, many on the Oklahoma Highway Patrol tracking unit) and that they moved peculiarly with the clear and some of the bright sky.

A spokesman explained that it was exceptionally strange lighting for the horizon.

Sightings were reported in a steady stream between 5 p.m. Sunday and 3 a.m. Monday in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Kansas.

Air force bases and air force bases centered throughout the area reported tracking something.

The deluge of reports is the heaviest in the 17-year history of UFO's, he said.

City Calls Heavy
Oklahoma City police said they received 30 to 40 UFO reports during the night.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol headquarters reported a similar experience and at one point three dispatchers couldn't handle all the reports.

Reports of UFO's poured in from Pecos, Monahans, Odessa, Midland, Fort Worth, Canyon and Durant, Texas; Hobbs, Carlsbad and Artesia, N. M.; Oxford, Belle Plaine, Winfield, Caldwell, Abilene, Liberal and Wichita, Kan.

In Oklahoma, they came from Chickasha, Shawnee, Cushing, Guymon, Moore, Tulsa, Purcell, Norman, Meeker, Chandler, G.s.g., Del City and Oklahoma City.

The air force's official UFO center at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, was reported launching an investigation Monday.

An air force spokesman for the Oklahoma City Air Defense Command said he was certain that a plane was sent after one of the UFO's.

North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs was reported in touch with the air force in connection with the UFO sighting.

The Sedgwick County sheriff's office at Wichita, Kan., said the sheriff's office had tracked several UFO's at altitudes of 5,000 to 9,000 feet.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said their "Tinker" was tracking as many as four UFO's on its radar screen at one time, estimated their altitude at about 2,000 feet. A Tinker spokesman, however, declined comment.

THEORY OFFERED
Mystery Objects
There All Along?

Dale Johnson, director of the Kirkpatrick Planetarium, said if is a "mystery" that the Air Force got its "information" that the objects may have been the planet Jupiter.

"Jupiter is not in view this time of year," Johnson said.

The only planets visible now are Mars, which is overhead in the early evening, and Venus. Saturn comes into view in the morning.

People may be seeing Antares, a star in the south, which can cause color distortion or Vega, which is overhead about 9 p.m.

One report even had a UFO land near Justin, Texas. It miles from Denton.

Other reports had green or red UFOs and brilliant white UFOs zipping through unusually clear skies.

Hundreds of reports streamed into The Highway Patrol, police departments, Tinker Air Force Base, the U.S. Weather Bureau and news media for the third straight week.

The Air Force statement stuck from Washington, D.C. that some reports could be observations of a Delta meteor shower occurring last two days temperature

Look at the sky long enough and you'll see â of imagine you see â all sorts of things, particularly if you're not accustomed to sky-watching.

That's why so many people are seeing mysterious flying objects, explains Dale Johnson, director of the Kirkpatrick Planetarium.

He says the natural phenomenon which cause such sightings are present at this time, but usually go unnoticed.

"Normally," he says, "people don't pay much attention to the sky. But when you have a lot of people gazing skyward, they'll see things they never paid any attention to before."

Johnson believes that in a great majority of cases, people who report seeing strange stars are simply bright stars that they hadn't noticed before.

Also, certain atmospheric conditions, such as "scintillating," make distant objects appear to move around or change color.

This is also the time of year, explains Johnson, when there are an unusual large number of meteors. The next strong meteor shower will be August 10 and it will be interesting to see if we get a large number of UFO reports at that time.

Johnson believes many of the UFOs may be such planets as Mars, Venus, Saturn, Antares or Vega. All appear much brighter than other stars this time of year.

Another bright planet, Jupiter, is not visible this year.

"I'm not saying people are not seeing what they report," Johnson points out. "I believe they are simply seeing a phenomenon before, one which creates some kind of optical illusion."

Since the current rash of UFO sightings started, Johnson has observed sides several nights hoping to spot some unusual objects.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?
By Jim Jackson and Ivy Coffey
Of the State Staff

Stars, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions were the official Air Force explanations Sunday night for a rash of flying objects seen throughout the week of Oklahoma and into neighboring states.

Meanwhile, sightings of unexplained objects in the sky were continuing.

The objects, sometimes described as glowing lights, were spotted in Norman, Blanchard, Woodward, Tishomingo, Durant, Hobart, Oklahoma City and other parts of the state.

The lights were reported over a period of several hours and varied in size, shape and color.

In Cushing, J. C. Knoch, used furniture dealer, and his son, Ricky, 11, saw what they described as a large circular object flying over northeast Cushing at 12:50 p.m. Monday in full daylight.

Knoch, in the process of building a new furniture store, was looking out the window of his shop when he spotted the object. He described it as having black stripes or black wings and silver on the bottom side. It almost hurt his eyes to look at it, he said.

Four boys in Oklahoma City reported seeing approximately the same type of thing at 3:30 p.m. Monday on SE 46. They said they spotted a silver triangular object, striped and glowing, headed east across the sky and then vanishing.

The air force, in its announcement from Washington, said initial study of the flood of sighting reports indicated the sightings were "astronomical in nature."

"The objects observed may have been the planet Jupiter or stars Rigel Capella, Betelgeuse or Aldebaran which were visible," the air force statement continued. "At the time of the reported sightings, the azimuth and elevation of the reported sightings substantiate this."

The air force denied an unconfirmed report that the objects had been tracked by radar and denied that any planes were scrambled in an attempt to intercept or identify the UFOs.

The air force statement also pointed out that temperature, distribution and variant wind speeds both Sunday and Monday over the area were considered "favorable to scintillation."

Though the air force thinks the objects are stars, the investigation is continuing, they said.

Prof. H. S. Mendenhall, OSU mathematics professor and astronomer, favors the scientific view and recalled that air force pilots in World War II reported seeing similar objects but thought they were enemy planes flying at what turned out to be the planet Venus.

He said such illusions probably are caused by an unstable atmosphere, which spreads out the light into a spectrum of its basic colors.

He said the prism effect could account for such sightings of what appear to be red and green lights.

Dr. Walter Saucier, meteorology professor and director of OU's atmospheric research laboratory, declined to comment on the things.

When asked about the objects, he just said: "Tom J. Love is director of mechanical engineering at OU and he studies the objects seen were air balloons."

Swamped with telephone reports of strange objects, Bethany police office evening reported two "strange objects" at NW 42 and Rockwell. A parental report said the list to Warr Acres police included NW 36 and 1 block west of Rockwell.

Five boys reported to Oklahoma City that at dusk they saw a round, shiny object without wings close to the ground in the 600 block on NW 58.

Two Oklahoma City boys, Robert Coubarn, 11 and Charles Dethoal, at the Dethoal home, 512 NW 41, saw a red light blinking on and off. They said the object was a big "oval-like" thing flying to the north and then it stopped and reversed.

Police Chief Don Kutch said there was no question of a UFO southwest of town. He checked after receiving a report and Kutch said he and his wife saw the object.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper Dewey Bennett reported sighting a green object north of Tishomingo traveling high up. He said a jet plane seemed close to the object.

Several Woodward citizens reported seeing a red globe flying over Woodward.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?-
By Jim Jackson and Ray Coffey
Of the State Staff

Stars, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions were official targets Monday night for a crash sightings of unidentified flying objects scattered over most of Oklahoma and into neighboring states. Meanwhile, sightings of unexplained objects in the sky were continuing.

The objects, sometimes described as glowing lights, were spotted in Norman, Blanchard, Woodward, Tishomingo, Durant, Rienzi and other parts of the state and in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico.

Though the air force thinks the objects are stars, the investigation is continuing.

Prof. H. S. Mondenhall, OSU mathematics professor and astronomer, favors the scientific theory and receded that air force pilots in World War II reported seeing chased and even photographed strange objects in the sky which turned out to be the planet Venus.

He said such such illusions probably are caused by an unstable atmosphere, which spreads out like a prism acting like a prism.

Dr. Walter Saucier, meteorology professor and director of OSU's atmosphere research laboratory, declined to speculate. "I have no idea what those things are," he said. "And I'm just going to stick my neck out and guess. I'll pass."

Dr. Tom J. Love Jr., director of the school of mechanical engineering and meteorology studies at OSU said he is certain some of the objects seen were not optical illusions.

Police departments over the state were reporting strange objects in the sky.

Bartlany police officer Jim McGill Monday evening spotted two "saucers" while in his car at NW 42 and Rockwell. He said they were apparently the same as two objects reported earlier by Warr Acres police by a boy and his mother at NW 36 and Hammond. The object changed colors, red, white and green.

In Cushing, J. C. Knock, used furniture dealer, and his son, Rickey, 11, saw what they described as a large circular object flying over northeast Cushing at 12:50 p.m. Monday in full daylight.

Five boys reported to Oklahoma City that at dusk they saw a round, shiny object without wings close to the ground in the NW 100 block on NW 42.

Two Oklahoma City boys, Robert Colbert, 11, and Charles Delloral, at the Delloral home, 512 NW 41, saw a red light blinking on and off. They said the object was a big "oval-like" thing flying to the north and then it stopped.

Robert Police Chief Doss Kuch said there was no question of an UFO southeast of Hobart. He checked after receiving a report.

Several Woodward citizens reported seeing a solid red form hovering over the town at 10:30 p.m.

The article continues with more details about various UFO sightings, but the text above captures the full OCR output from the document.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Identification from officials at Perrin Air Force Base, Denison, Texas. They said it is likely a plane launched with large-size weather balloons. They withheld positive identification until they saw the object.

Meade found the "thing" in his pasture Monday. He said it definitely was not there Sunday.

Unidentified flying objects were sighted in the Bryan County area Sunday night â glowing red and skimming just above treetop level, according to witnesses.

"Maybe Mars has an ALCOA plane there, too," one witness commented.

The fleet of objects over Brazil was first seen by two little girls. They saw four moving over the horizon in daylight at Astorga, about 250 miles west of Sao Paulo. They called three neighbors, who reported seeing 14 other saucers in formation. They were described as silvery with a greenish light shining from the top.

John Stark, 952 NW 5. Moore, reported he watched some object with a reddish light on top and a white light on the bottom hover at what he estimated as 2,000 feet above Will Rogers World Airport around 9 p.m. Tuesday.

"I couldn't see the shape of it," he said, "but I could see it had two distinct sources of light. It kinda makes you up; it's no laughing matter."

Stark said he called his wife over when he had the object lined up between two houses. It hovered there, he said, as lights from a plane passed at the same level, then took off and disappeared.

Stark said the lights on the object were "six or eight times brighter than a star." He is a student at Central State College, Edmond, is a sports writer for The Daily Oklahoman.

Like the unidentified flying objects, the Oklahoma City park â witchboard glowed brightly with numerous reported sightings, mostly from the west side of town.

One young reporter seeing an object rise elsewhere from Lake Hefner said he saw a bright object circling about a mile from his home at two points during the evening.

Joe Swindle, 11, said he, his parents and sister watched a bright orange object that "looked like a ball of fire" about 8:20 p.m. Tuesday near NW 16th and Hill and Sharrel. He said he watched it for about two minutes at about 5:30 p.m.

Another resident saw a bright blue object "with a tail" about halfway up in the sky from his home at NW 16th and Hill and Sharrel. He said he watched it for about two minutes.

The highway patrol reported Tuesday night unidentified objects were seen in the skies over Erick, Lawton and in the Tulsa area.

THE MAIN INVASION WAVE

Wynnewood, Oklahoma
July 31, 1955

At 1:05 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, July 31st the UFO's came back to Oklahoma. Wynnewood, Oklahoma police officer Lewis Sikes, 26, reported an unidentified flying object approximately 30-35 NE of Wynnewood. Officer Sikes did not realize that the UFO was also being watched simultaneously by radar from Tinker AFB, Fort Worth, Texas. Officer Sikes observed the UFO with his wife for approximately 10 minutes.

In front of their home, when Officer Sikes drove across town and observed the UFO for another three minutes. His wife, Gail-Jean continued to watch the UFO until 2:30 a.m.

An "Intelligent control" was indicated during the first 10 minutes of observation when the object changed altitude (estimated by Sikes to be 10,000 ft., continued by radar at 8,000 ft.). The UFO remained stationary for several minutes and abruptly lost approximately 1500-2000 ft. The UFO then moved to the west for approximately 1500-1600 ft. and returned to the original location, at which time it moved to the east for approximately 100-1500 ft. then returned to its original position.

The night sky was clear, and many stars were visible. The UFO appeared to be three times as bright as the evening star and was estimated by Sikes to be five miles in diameter. The UFO was described as a "light" source. The UFO itself was white with a blue-green center, with a red rotating edge.

At approximately 1:15 Officer Sikes drove across town and once again observed the UFO. His wife stated that while he was gone the UFO seemed to change colors and fade out. The UFO then reappeared and both Tinker AFB and the Carson City, Nevada, radar picked it up.

Both Tinker AFB, AEC, and a point 15 miles southwest of Tinker when it disappeared. A few minutes later, it was tracked to a location 29 miles south of Tinker when it was lost again. A Braniff airliner in the vicinity of Wynnewood at 5,000 ft. was notified but the airline pilot said no visual contact with the UFO was made. Officer Sikes' mother, Mrs. Robert Sikes, also watched the UFO and reported that it faded out.

knew about it. Within an hour my wife, Karen, DeWayne Critchfield, our photographer and Public Relations man were on our way. I was assigned to interview Officer Skee for how long. We returned to Oklahoma City and started putting the story on paper. Sunday afternoon with the help of W. F. Riefer, our Senior Director, we interviewed Officer Sikes again.

Upon returning to Oklahoma City a full report was typed out.

At 9:00 a.m. the telephone rang and Mike Buchanan said the Oklahoma Highway Patrol tower located near Edmond, Oklahoma had been receiving UFO reports since 3:03 p.m. So far they had received a total of 25-30 reports. The UFO's were signaled to Chandler and back, south through Meeker and Shawnee. Shawnee reported that the UFO's were flying in a diamond type formation. Cushing reported four of the UFO's. Tinker AFB, stated they had four UFO's on radar at 22,000 ft. which coincided with visual sightings. The UFO's were all multi-colored. They moved for as much as two hours, faded out or shot off.

distribution and variant wind
speed were favorable to "scintil-
lation." "Scintillation" is a natural
phenomenon which causes stars to
appear to twinkle or distant ob-
jects to appear to dance when seen
through layers of the atmosphere.
It was also a possibility that the
observers were seeing the Aquatad,
commonly called the Delta Meteor
shower which is occurring from
July 26 to August 6.

Dale Johnson, 100UFO Scien-
tific Panel member and Associate
Director of the Kirkpatrick Plane-
tarium located in Oklahoma City
said it is a "mystery where the
Air Force get its information."

Robert Riser of the Oklahoma
Science and Arts Foundation,
Kirkpatrick Planetarium said ob-
servers certainly did not see the
planes, and stars the Air Force
claim. "That is as far from the
truth as you can get," Riser said.

Some one has made a mistake.
These stars and planets are on the
chart. The observation was made
Oklahoma at this time of the year.
About 9:30 p.m. one of the
closest observations was made by
an Air Force weather expert
through a 20 power spotting scope
when it flew over Norman, Okla-
homa. "The thing was moving fast
and was observed for less than five
minutes. It was estimated to be 20,-
000 ft. up and pitched at a 45Â°
angle. It was surrounded by a bluish
halo. Out the ensued shape was
two to distinguish. There were
two sets of revolving, pulsating
lights on the object," the expert
was illuminated by the red lights.
The lights were pulsating, dim to
bright and then bright to dim.

There were several reports from
Oklahoma and neighboring states
of several UFOs had landed.
At 3:14 a.m. Sept. 12, Oklahoma
reported that a large UFO was
on the ground near Pole Cat Creek
Bridge on US 70A between Spar-
pa and Keifer. It was a large light
about 50-75 feet across and was
oblong. The grass upon investiga-
tion showed evidence that some-
thing had been there.

Of all the landings, two in Okla-
homa City are the most convene-
ing. An Oklahoma City man be-
lieved he saw a UFO land. He
was fishing at Lake Hefner a large
"chaser" shaped object with a
dome on top and a flat bottom rose
out of the lake, hovered and flew
off. He was admitted to an Okla-
homa City hospital in a state of
shock. His observation was on Sat-
urday afternoon about 1:30 two
days before drawings of the ob-
jects that appeared in the news-
papers which were sighted the
night after the Wynnewood eight-
ing and the night before the in-
vasion. (See page 12)

At 11:15 p.m. a little later about
a year ago, it was buried near
"Jeet" in Northeast Oklahoma City.

Air Intelligence Staffs Plagued by 'Objects' for 20 Years

She was picked up by ambulance and taken to a hospital in Oklahoma City. She had received third degree burns over 60% of her body and her clothes had not been burned. I conducted a personal investigation with Major C. W. Duerrson of the Oklahoma Civil Defense and located three witnesses to the pick up. but all Oklahoma City hospitals state that no admittance was made. I wonder who gave the "clean up" orders?

An Oklahoma Civil Defense officer sighted a UFO between 10:30 until 11:00 p.m. on Monday evening, August 2 while driving from Oklahoma City on Interstate 35 enroute to Norman. The object was NE of Norman. In a letter dated August 4, 1965, to HQUFO headquarters "The craft was in the or over, the NE area of Norman. There was a quarter plus moon and the comparative size of the craft was almost as big as the moon would have been were it full. I saw four or six lights that were blinking regularly in rhythm; there was never any variance in the rhythm I did not bother to count the lights because I was so starry, but half of them were red and half of them were either blue, green, or blue-green; the colors were alternated and were arranged in a circle that in my view looked oval-shaped. The red lights blinked simultaneously, and then the other colored lights would blink simultaneously. All this time the lights were traveling in a counter-clockwise motion on the craft.

Then it emitted a short brilliant white or yellowish flash, and suddenly changed its direction and began to travel toward the southwest toward Norman. When it reached a point southwest of Norman it again emitted that white or yellowish flash and once again began traveling toward the NE of Norman. I will further say that this object was too clear, too rhythmical and too complex for an illusion or a hallucination. I have information on file HQUFO headquarters.

The following information was received from the Chief of Police, Sentinel, Oklahoma. At approximately 1:15 a.m. this date (August 2nd) the officer on duty, called by public service to report that several police units around the area was observing UFO's. At approximately 1:20 a.m. I was picked up and went west of town 1/4 miles, turned off our lights and started observing. From reports from the deputy sheriff and others watching on the approximate location of the object, and at 1:30 a.m. observed it ourself. When we first observed the UFO, it was moving in a northeasterly direction at a rapid speed, appearing to change colors of amber, white and a pale

UFO Facts Withheld, Group Claims

Wichita Beacon
Friday, August
6, 1965

Blue. The object stopped in the NE,
between 60-85Â° angle from us.
Could not tell the distance, but
would say between 50-150 miles.
We observed the UFO for 30 minutes. At about this time (2 a.m.)
the Granite unit reported another
object traveling in a northerly direction, being red in color and
shooting red sparks from it. We
went and tried to observe the object, but could not locate it.

Unidentified "blips" on the radar screen at the Wichita Bureau confirmed the presence of
unidentified flying objects around
Wichita. (photo page 11)

Several attempts were made to
photograph the UFO's but almost
all failed. One photo was obtained
by Junction City, Kansas photographer George Goodson who captured 8 ovals. The objects were
not visible when the photo was
taken. I was in Topeka, Junction
City and Wichita during the weekend of August 5 and 7 and personally investigated the Junction
City photo as well as several reports around Topeka and Wichita.

UFOs Photographed
Junction City Photo                                July 23, 1955

Widespread reports of unidentified flying objects over the world including several radar contacts stirred interest at the Daily Union office when staff photographer George Goodson photographed eight UFOs.

The photo was taken at 4:10 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, (August 1st) at the municipal airport. The photo was snapped to show the parachute descent of a member of the Junction City Sky Diving club, but after development of the negative on August 2nd, disclosed eight disks in the sky at the last center. At first they were thought to be either a flaw in the film, or possibly water or developer solution spots on the film. But it was noticed that the parachute lines crossed the disks. Goodson took the photo northwest and said he had not seen anything like this before.

PHOTO DIRECTOR Hayden Hewes interviewed Mr. Goodson Saturday, August 7, 1955 while he was in Junction City.

Wichita, Kansas Weather Bureau radar scope showed unidentified flying objects Sunday night (August 1st) in a white circle blip. Other sightings at different times and locations of white objects as the objects moved across the scope.

Mr. John Shockley, Wichita weatherman, tracked "them" at different times between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. mostly on the south side of the city. "The UFOs were about the size of a Cessna on the screen of the Weather Bureau radar screen and were flying at altitudes 6,000 to 9,000 ft. The Weather Bureau radar screen covers about all of the state of Kansas.

On July 23, 1955 at 3:30 p.m. the following photographs was taken by KOLO State Director August Powell while taking scenery pictures of the San Francisco Peaks. The dark cylindrical-shaped UFO was moving West to East about 15Â° above the Southern horizon. Three photographs were obtained but only two came out. The UFO appeared to be 1/4 of an inch long at arms length. It was moving slower than jet speed.

Note: It was also described by many persons in Oklahoma.

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
TINKER AFB, OKLAHOMA 73145

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: OCBB

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: AFSC (PTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio 45433

1. The attached information pertaining to unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings reported in this area during the period of 31 July through 3 August 1965 is submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2, Paragraph 1 of TIG Brief Nr 11, Volume XVI, dated 22 May 1964, eliminates the old policy as desired in the referenced reports are not to be reported as unidentified flying objects; however, due to the wide publicity regarding UFOs in this area, this information is submitted in an effort to clarify the matter.

2. On 31 July 1965 at 0735 Zulu (z) hours, the initial report of UFOs in series of reported UFOs was received in this office from Winnewood, Oklahoma. This object was determined to be a weather balloon released from this installation. Since that time, local news media, i.e. newspapers, radio, and television stations, highly publicized the report to the extent one local radio station held a contest how many UFO reports could be reported during one evening and also held was was-called a UFO party at their radio station on another evening. Such publicity has generated a tremendous amount of interest in sky watching among the populace of this state, which has resulted in a flood of UFO reports (see attached newspaper clippings). Investigation of these reports has revealed the UFO's as being straw, which are extremely visible during this time of year from this location; high flying aircraft, current in landing pattern, and weather balloons.

3. On 1 August 1965, Harry P. Alderill, Meteorological Technician and Supervisor, 6th Weather Squadron, Tinker AFB, was interviewed regarding the UFOs reported in this area. Alderill stated his organization released weather balloons twice daily, one at 1715 Z hours and one at 0515 Z hours. Alderill described the weather balloons as being light tan, brown, or white in color, 6 to 8 feet in diameter, 4 to 5 feet long, with radio sound equipment attached to a 100 foot long train. According to Alderill, all weather balloons released at night or during the hours of darkness have a small white light which is attached to a parachute on the balloon. Alderill stated that the balloons ascend to approximately 100,000 feet altitude, at which time they burst or develop a leak and start to descend, at which time the radio sound equipment would normally begin to oscillate, which in turn would cause the parachute to oscillate. According to Alderill, the light shining on the oscillating parachute would reflect different shades of red and this color. Alderill stated that the balloon did burst, normal descending time would be approximately forty minutes, however, if the balloon developed a leak and did not burst, the

descending time would be considerably longer, depending on the extent of
the leak in the balloon, which would allow the balloon to drift to a
number of different locations, changing course gradually, depending
on wind currents and velocity as it drifted back to the earth.

4. Averill checked records and stated that the weather balloon released
by his organization at 0515 2 hours, 31 July 1965, was tracked until
0557 2 hours, 31 July 1965, at which time the balloon was located 23
miles due south of this installation, which is approximately thirty
miles north of Winnewood. Averill stated that the balloon was at 101,000
feet altitude and was drifting toward Winnewood at that time. He con-
tinued that the wind aloft, the balloon should have continued
traveling toward Winnewood while descending.

5. Records maintained by the 7466th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron,
Oklahoma City Air Force Station, reflect that SSgt William C. Teeney,
AF16229269, Radar Operator, was on duty and received information on the
initial report of an unidentified flying object on 31 July 1965 at 0740 Z
hours in the vicinity of Winnewood. The records indicate that an object
was picked up on radar at approximately 10,000 feet altitude and was
tracked to within fifteen nautical miles southeast of the installation.
Radar contact was lost at 205Â° azimuth, twenty-nine nautical miles from
this installation, which is in the area of the Goldable Airport. Position
and tracking characteristics correlated with Cerewell AFB, Texas radar.
These records do not reflect any other objects in that area during that
period of time.

6. Lt Walter J. Harrison, A0313170, Chief Weather Forecaster, Detach-
ment 13, 24th Weather Squadron, Tinker AFB, was interviewed on 3 August
1965 regarding the UFOs reported in this area. Harrison stated that
this area during the months of May, June, July, and mid-August, there is
a transparent haze in the atmosphere that is particularly heavy. Accord-
ing to Harrison, on clear nights the haze will reflect lights and scenes
from other areas which results in unusual sightings and mirages. Harrison
concluded that this could possibly account for some of the reported
unidentified flying objects.

7. On 4 August 1965, [redacted] the Kirkpatrick Place,
Tarlton, 3000 General Pershing Street, Oklahoma City, Okla., was inter-
viewed regarding any UFOs he might have observed between 31 July and
3 August 1965. [redacted] stated that his study of the site is on a
continuous basis, and he was especially watchful during the dates in
question, during which time he did not observe anything unusually,
unidentifiable, or different. [redacted] stated he had received
numerous reports of UFOs during that time, and nine out of ten of the
reports received were stars. Accordingly, [redacted] the person
is unducated as to what the sky normally looks like and when they

start looking and studying the sky, they see things that to them are unidentifiable and unexplainable. It was stated that a number of stars are extremely bright, and others at this time of year, also an unusually large number of meteors are visible in this area during the summer months. According to some civilian pilots, plane temperature invasion and mirages could result in numerous reports of UFOs by persons not familiar with the sky.

8. Floyd J. Wilson, Chief Proficiency Officer, RAFCON, Tinker AFB, was contacted regarding radar tracking of aircraft during period of 2200 Central Standard Time (CST), 31 July 1955, through 2400 CST, 3 August 1955. Wilson stated that his organization operates on a twenty-four hour day basis and tracks aircraft within a forty mile radius of this installation. Wilson was unable to produce records on any aircraft's exact location during the dates in question. He had been sent to Ft. Worth, Texas. Wilson's records indicated that during those dates a total of 1,039 aircraft were tracked by his organization.

9. Investigation revealed that balloons are released at the following lines and locations:

a. Tinker AFB, 6th Weather Squadron. Release two balloons daily, one at 1115 CST and one at 2315 CST.

b. US Weather Station, Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma City. Release two balloons daily, one at 0515 CST and one at 1715 CST.

c. US Weather Station, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Release two balloons daily, one at 1100 CST and one at 2300 CST.

d. Target Acquisition Battalion, Ft. Sill, Lawton, Oklahoma. Release three balloons daily at no set time; also four other organizations at that location release balloons. No mention of release time depend on the amount of artillery firing that is scheduled. All balloons released at night are equipped with lights.

Balloons are released at numerous other locations in this state; however, only those listed above were found to have released balloons during the dates in question.

10. This office will continue to investigate reported sightings of UFOs in this area, and reports will be submitted upon receipt. No information pertaining to any objects that cannot be identified. Samples of reported UFOs are attached. Additional reports of UFOs will be forwarded as received.

IDEN/UFO
UFO Sighting, 7 October 1965

Hq USAF SAFOICC (Maj. Hunt)

We have received a report of an unidentified flying object from [redacted], Texas.
Mrs. [redacted] has requested an evaluation of her sighting. A review of her Form 164 indicates that the sighting could be attributed to jet aircraft operations its terrain characteristics. The flight path and direction are in accord with this evaluation. The description of the white object with the red and white luminous exhaust also conforms with this analysis. Since the officer at Ellington Air Force Base who received her initial report initially stated that they had experienced with aircraft, it is possible that the observed one of these.

A sighting toward the Northwest at dusk often adds to distortion and visual misidentification of normal or conventional objects.

There were other reports from the area at about the same time. Twins observed with other objects. About fifteen minutes prior to this, several reports evaluated as a meteor were submitted to Billington. This meteor passed to the West of [redacted], and [redacted] and the motion or trajectory was straight and not rising. The object was in conflict with an aircraft sighting. We have given her report an evaluation of a possible aircraft.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17th January 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

pertaining to question 33 -

Officer at Ellington said it had been seen in other sections of city by about 6 persons (before I settled) he said that they said it had cut off exhaust at dark over where a first called. He said he was curious also - after he had taken information he said we had experienced aircraft.

He did not say if one was at this time. I asked about illuminated glow all around & he said it was friction from speed of plane. When conversation ended he was very business-like although he was curious himself when I first called.

Also, I do not remember date - I take your word for it as being Oct 7, 1965.

Here is the text from the document:

If it is at all possible, could you let me know if your findings, after you check the write up my report. I am very interested.

Thank you,
Sincerely

P.S. - I feel like I have not been of much help as something like this is hard to put on paper. Although if were a phone - it were quite different. Some idea of what I was playing in a direction that I could make the wings & the movement against it & I can see how some people might jump to conclusions - that they that I saw did not even resemble this. And also, the apparent or perhaps trail was noting like a flame it also looked solid (?).

PHOTO NO FORM NO.

(Additional Info.)

Glowing light with sharp wing on either side about center. I think they looked like light cones as if flying object was exploding or cut in 1/2. Reflection. Middle was sun out this one. While traveling was observing for unusual sky event time.

Weather was clear. No signs of rain. Sky was bright, on or about 20 miles from object.

Object at end still to me or would a end of so. I was in front of it for a few miles noticed its size and closeness to me on 1-2 tree tops.

(Seems to be some handwritten notes in margin, partially illegible)

Guess it seemed opposite traffic join under it. I didn't want to go under it in case it was falling. So turned off on sight to my destination. Flashed hard and other driver would report it something was wrong. I think it could be a balloon but was no source of lift making it reflect. And was of kinds of wavery. A plane or helicopter couldn't old still & no noise. I always have similar even when 2-3 months cold and have seen hearing but, can't be positive on the middle as concentration on all the visual elements, may have taken my attention.

Surrounding it.

I was on Comack road or Deer Park, Sandwich or last Northern state up to point where sign and road forks to right for going south to Asherville. Just learning now to drive to my friendhouse at that time. Only was Northern state then 110 here. Made trip by myself. Haven't had any enough to retrace my path on this day. If I did, I wasn't thinking of above. Gone to find out soon as I can think of it when traveling in that direction.
