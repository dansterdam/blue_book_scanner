Here is the text from the document:

(5) The object appeared and disappeared with "great speed," so that the entire time of observation was estimated to be 30 to 40 seconds.

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground-visual.
(2) No optical aids were used.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) Sometime between 1920 and 1930 Zulu on 15 August 1965.
(2) Light Conditions: Day.

e. Location of Observer: The observer was on the roof at Portsmouth, Virginia, which is three blocks east, northeast, of the WTAR T.V. Tower.

f. Identifying Information on Observer:
(1) Name:
(2) Grade: Journalist Third Class (J03), United States Coast Guard.
(3) Organization: Public Information Office, Fifth Coast Guard District, Federal Building, Portsmouth, Virginia.
(4) Duty: Journalist.

(5) Estimate of Reliability: Doubtful. Journalist apparently made every effort to exploit his observation for the sake of its newsworthiness. Although, perhaps not intentionally, his reporting of the sighting to his "many friends" in the news business has added to the already greatly publicized UFO sightings in the area. Shortly after the sighting, Journalist and WNOR radio and television stations and the Virginian Pilot Newspaper (AP). The next day Journalist accompanied the ledger Star Newspaper to the tower where the object was said to have stopped. Journalist stated that he works with these people every day because of the nature of his job in the Coast Guard. In my interview with Journalist, he later stated: "I'm a believer, I'm on, there is something out there we don't know about, I don't care if somebody writes it off or not." Journalist was extremely

unmilitary in his interview, frequently calling me "man." He stated
that he had been contacted by two private UFO investigating organizations.
One of these callers said he was from Langley AF Base. Journalist
asked to send to him. He could not remember these people's names or
the names of their organization, but said that they mentioned Air Force
surprising UFO information and asked if the Air Force had contacted
him. I interviewed Journalist on the night of 16 August 1965.

1. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dockum, USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing (DOO-M), Langley Air Force Base, Virginia.

A very possible cause of the reported object was a helicopter flying over Portsmouth, Virginia, and hovering near the T. V. Tower to view the city.

k. No physical evidence was reported to exist.
