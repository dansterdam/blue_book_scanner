Dear Sir:

This morning at 8:50 we watched two shiny discs of bright
the eastern sky over the sunrise. They went out of clouds nor plane. They
were sighted at a 60° angle with the lower tip towards the north. They
remained in this climbing position and seemed to be traveling toward
the northeast. They moved very slowly, sometimes stopping. They
seemed to be quite a distance, but we could see one larger and one
other one. The larger one seemed to be larger, but this may have been
due to the distance between them. At any rate, they seemed to be
very well defined with the sun shining on them, but they were not
very close moving differently than anything by comparison. It was their
strange movement that kept us interested.

Could you please inform us what they were. Also were there any
who saw them and did they appear on the scope?

Sincerely,

[Signature and additional details are blacked out]

k. Position Title and Comments of Preparing Officer:

Plans and Programs Officer.
It is not likely that the U-3A aircraft was involved in the sighting due to its size, and the approximate distance (40 mi) from the observers location. It was on a track, however, which caused it to pass to the north of Parryville, Missouri enroute to Crystal City. It is more probable that the sighting via the to the Convair-Ling conversion, blended with sunrise, which occurred at 0623 local, 5 March 1960. This condition could have caused reflection or the unusual phenomena as reported.

1. Physical Evidence - None.
