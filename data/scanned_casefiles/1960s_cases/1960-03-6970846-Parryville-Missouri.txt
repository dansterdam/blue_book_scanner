Commander 
ATTN: T.O. W.M. Smith
Belleville, Illinois

Dear Sir:

The object reported by you on March 9, 1960, to be a flying object, was probably a meteor or some other celestial body passing through the sky at the time indicated. 

The material is believed to have been a natural occurrence and not something from an unknown or unidentified source. They move at high speed and are often mistaken for some form of aircraft or aerial object. 

Captures of them often raise some speculation, but we have determined this to be a natural phenomenon and not something that requires further investigation at this time. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and please let us know if you have any other sightings in the future.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
