1. DATE, TIME GROUP: 67 9/23/62 W/0125*

2. LOCATION: Woodbridge-Manassus, Virginia multiple

3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION:
   1. 1/2 minutes
   2. 5 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: N/A

8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [X] No

10. CONCLUSION:
    1. Satellite(Echo II)
    2. Aircraft(possible)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
    Different observers at different times saw a similar object. The object was a silver colored and at times appeared to have a blinking red light. A second sighting was made ten miles some three hours later. Both observations were of a similar object. In both cases the object dropped out of sight beyond the horizon.

    Echo II was over the area at the time of the first sighting. It would be extremely difficult to determine if both objects were one in the same just because they occurred during the same night within three hours of each other. No proof that the same object was observed. There were aircraft in the area at the time but the exact position is not known.
