Dear Mr.

This will acknowledge your letter of 26 October 1960 concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object as you watched our "Echo" balloon.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, ask that you fill out the enclosed Air Force Questionnaire and forward the completed document to the Commander, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

Approximately two months ago I became interested in watching
our "School balloon passing over" and was told to continue to
observe its flight whenever possible. At the same time tonight
that another object was no more but moving very slow. After any
nites of clear weather and other people who have also watched this
object I will try to describe it to you.

On a clear nite it will appear just like a star - west by North-
west from Gurney, Ill. and about straight west of Slater Sky, and
at about 30°- 35° above the horizon. It appears to wobble in
the Northwest until it is out of sight behind the horizon. As it gets
closer to the horizon the colors start to vary from a white to pale
green, rose, and orange.

Could you offer any information on this.
Sincerely yours

/s/
Gurney, Ill.

Gurnee, Illinois

Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

Although we have received reports from other observers of this object which you describe, we have had no official literature concerning it from the involved official government agencies. Therefore, it is our policy as well as practice that your object is probably the result of some natural phenomenon. These reports are all handled into polar orbit by the U.S. Air Force from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Their chief function is to solve the problem of nose cone survival preparatory to sending man into space. However, all information about available, we thank you for your interest.

Yours very truly,

Frank C. Jettmar, Jr.
