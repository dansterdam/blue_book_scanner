Dear Major Quintanilla:

I would like to report a Unidentified Flying Object sighted on the night of August 21, 1963. Hereis a brief outline of what the night was like:

I. Conditions on Night of Sighting
a. Clear Sky
b. No moon
c. Slightly chilly
d. Humid air
e. Number of objects seen: three (3)
f. Number of Witnesses- five (Approx.)

It went on a constant path with no irregular or jerky movements. It was sighted above Camp Krutka Galli. It is a Habonim camp in Ottsville, Bucks County, Pa.

I have enclosed a picture of one of the objects. It was taken by a Polaroid Swinger Camera, Film Type 20. I had the film checked and there was no defect in the film. I have also enclosed the negative. Please return both and reply to this letter.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Butler, Pennsylvania
