The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The page contains text and a diagram that asks the viewer to imagine a sketch of an object in the sky and describe its movement and direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Draw an arrow to show the direction the object was traveling. If you saw the object only once, place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text below the diagram provides a handwritten response:
A. all very irregular course - not a general direction. B. (north-east)
They were scattered completely, but all traveling in a westerly direction.

Received a call from Sgt. XXXXX, Urbana Sheriff on 16 Aug 65 regarding observations by Deputy Sheriff P. McCullough, Court-House, Urbana and M. XXXXX, Ohio 43078. Forms were sent to them on 17 Aug 65. They had two calls last night and a deputy also observed the objects. Saw five or six objects out of East going West, very bright then headed North. Weren't too high. Objects observed for 1 hour.
Sgt. Moody explained about the low level flights being made from Lockbourne AFB during this period of time. However, we would send them forms to fill out.
Received a call from XXXXX on 17 Aug 65. He has seen flying saucers for the past four straight nights. What happened last night he said he couldn't put on paper. They flew in straight form over the field just night, practically all night, 3 am to daylight. Tried to get up to a height, one had trouble and another one went to his rescue approximately 1hr and held him in tow when she rescue plane came. Snow white objects, four straight nights.
He wanted Major to tell the control tower people about these. Mr.D convinced him that he should go ahead anyway and fill out the forms and then Major Quintanilla would inform the control tower personnel.
Mr. XXXXX seemed very happy after this explanation and said he would fill out the forms right away because he didn't want anything to happen and he would be out looking again tonight.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire:

Tonight, all the sightings had me heart about 1:00. I was not sleepy as I watched the object come directly overhead at about 3:30. The object appeared directly in the east coming in very low. It seemed to hover in trouble trying to keep it's elevation. I tried very hard to go up, but it would go up a short way, then come down again. It continued the operation for quite some time. However, all the time, I was making an observatory about over the air base to the west. The object seemed to be communicating a cable or some object to the west. It would go up, then come down. The scene was not such 20 to 30 seconds upon separate time. (Estimate) Just as the object started to show light in the east a large object appeared.

On the scene and the debris object was located only the lowest section of the large object. A gage gave the height was high enough for me to crawl under at that point but the rest was from ground level straight up about 200 feet long according to my measurements. When the gage was high as 7 feet. There were no marks or indicators where the rest had been. It seemed that the remainder must have been very carefully removed. I had numerous photographs but in a move in may 1964 they were misplaced. 9 had numerous witnesses and in a good view and I could talk to any person 
giving information.

SUMMATION
Powell Ave. is located on the East side of the City of Urbana, and goes East and West. The object was seen about a 1/2 mile West of Powell Ave. and about 1/2 way up in the sky. The object was described as round, glowing white, and several times larger than a star. It was observed for several minutes and then made a sudden vertical ascent, at a high rate of speed, and disappeared. The deputy sheriff and a civilian observer both observed this object, and checked the Powell Ave. area. The results of this test were negative.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting that occurred in Urbana, Ohio on August 30, 1965.

URBANA, OHIO
30 AUGUST 1965

At approximately 2315 to 2330 hours, three observers were traveling south on U.S. Route 68. They noticed a slow-moving object in the sky, which they called a "UFO". This object was traveling in the same direction as the car. The driver of the car slammed on his brakes to prevent hitting the object. This action appeared to be in reaction to the object and the object appeared to slow down and move off in the direction of travel.

The object was about five feet in diameter, and was approximately the same color as a star, glowing. It was noted by the observers.

Since the object was in view for only three or four seconds, the driver stopped the car and opened the door to get a better view, but the object had disappeared. While time was being lost in Closing the door, the object was seen to rise vertically and disappear about 300 feet above the ground.

The object did not fluctuate as if it was moving along Route 68. There were no sounds audible and the object appeared to be going straight up and down.

Another witness in the car stated he did not see the object. He said the object was moving about as fast as an aircraft. This witness stated the object looked like a disc-shaped object with a domelike projection on top.

COMMENTS
The initial portion of the sighting has the characteristics of being a conventional object. However, the object was described as being very slow and very low. The speed and elevation of the object is conflicting at this observation point. It is more reasonable to believe the object went directly up. The difference in observation between two witnesses caused some concern. Driver's reaction may have been illusory, however it is alarming to all observers. The observers continued to watch the object as it was going south along Route 68. One witness maintains he saw the object vertically moving very rapidly, another witness maintains a much slower pattern of movement, speed and elevation varying greatly between the two observations.

From the information received, no concrete explanation is available and the case is carried as unidentified.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object did not disappear, it appeard to shrink.
15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? Yes
16. Did the object move in front of something or any time, particularly a cloud? No
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - The sound was a slight hissing sound, b. Color - The object was grey
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The object would have covered about 1/4 to 1/3 the length of the match head.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protruding parts, etc., and particularly where the object was in relation to the drawing to show the direction it was moving.
