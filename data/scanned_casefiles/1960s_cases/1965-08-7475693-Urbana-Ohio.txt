Received a call from Sgt Shilling Urbana Sheriff on 16 Aug 65 regarding observations by Deputy Sheriff P McCullough, Court-House, Urbana and Urbana, Ohio 43073. Forms were sent to them on 17 Aug 65. They had two calls last night and a deputy also observed the objects. Saw five or six objects out of East going West, very bright then headed North. Weren't too high. Objects observed for ½ hour.

Sgt Moody explained about the low level flights being made from Lockbourne AFB during this period of time. However, we would send them forms to fill out.

Received a call from on 17 Aug 65. He has seen flying saucers for the past four straight nights. What happened last night he said he couldn't put on paper. They flew in straight form over the field last night, practically all night, 3 am to daylight. Tried to get up to a height, one had trouble and another one went to his rescue approximately 1hr and held him in tow when the rescue plane came. Snow white objects, four straight nights.

He wanted Major to tell the control tower people about these. Major convinced him that he should go ahead anyway and fill out the forms and then Major Quintanilla would inform the control tower personnel.

Mr seemed very happy after this explanation and said he would fill out the forms right away because he didn't want anything to happen and he would be out looking again tonight.

Tonight all the sight-seers left me at about 1:00. I was not sleep as I watched the office alone at about 3:30. The 8th object appeared directly in the east coming in very low. I seemed to have trouble trying to keep elevation. I tried very hard to go up, but it would go up a short ways then drift down again. S.I. continued the operation for about an hour but was getting slower all the time. In the meantime there were 20 feet setting stationary about over the air base to the south. The one to the north went to its aid. Some offset to it but couldn't lift it in height. The area was not over 20 to 30 thousand feet up at the time. (Estimate) Just as the sky started to show lights in the east a large object appeared.

Here is the text from the document:

on the scene and the disabled object was hoisted into the lower section of the large object.

By this time the lights were bright enough at that height that I got a very good look at the thing. It was to my estimation, about 200 feet long and 10 a feet wide. The bottom was flat but the top was dome shaped. I had numerous windows in its sides. When the boundary was cleared it went nearly straight off bearing to the East, and in so a way seemed it was out of sight. The or object remained the same locality for another 5 or 6 minutes. Broad day light. I came down very low and I saw it plain. I was snow white. Then it returned to its position west of its original position. I got a very good view

I would like to talk to any person on the

Q. How large did the object appear to you?

Q. About 8 feet in diameter?

Q. Boys there seems to be some conflict in your stories about the length of time that you had the object in sight, what about this?

Q. Now boys you know if this story gets around that you may possibly be engineering the reputations of yourselves, your family and your friends, especially if your story is not complete truth?
A. Yes we know, but we are telling you the truth.

SUMMATION
Powell Ave. is located at the South-East edge of the City of Urbana, and goes East from the city limits to State Route 36. This flying object was supposed to have been seen about a ¼ of a mile West of Route 54 on Powell Ave., as a straight road and does not have any hills. Located on the last highway immediately after the last intersection I borrowed a Survey Meter that detects Gamma and Beta rays (Very sensitive) and checked the Powell Ave. area. The results of this test were negative.

URBANA, OHIO
30 AUGUST 1965

At approximately 2215 - 2230 hours, three observers were in an automobile traveling towards Route 54 when they noted a white round solid wall came down from the sky and hit the road right in front of the automobile. The driver of the car slammed on his brakes to prevent hitting the object. This object appeared to hit the ground and bounce directly back into the air. There were no sparks when the object the ground.

The object was about five feet in diameter, and was approximately the same color as a star only brighter. There were no projections, such as wings, noted by the observers.

The object was in view for only three or four seconds. The driver stopped the car and opened the door to get a better view, but the object had disappeared by this time. After getting back into the car the driver started moving and once again saw the object going south, approximately 100 feet above the ground. The object did not fluctuate as it was moving along Route 54. There were no sounds at anytime during the observation nor any type of vapor trail; however, there was a streak of light about 14 or 2 feet long following it.

Another witness in the car stated he did not see the object near the road; he noticed the light as it was moving upward. The object was moving about as fast as an aircraft. This witness stated the object looked like a disc shaped object about eight feet in diameter.

COMMENTS:

The initial portion of the sighting has the characteristics of being a meteor; however, the fact that the object was noted traveling south and following Route 54 leads to obfuscate this conclusion. The conflicting length of observation between witnesses causes some concern. Driver states he saw object as it moved along Route 54, but later stated he didn't see it anymore. As driver was leaving the original scene whatever object he saw, two observers continued to watch object as it was going south along Route 54. One witness, excluding the driver, stated he watched object for thirty seconds. Driver said that he was driving and didn't see the object as long as the other two.

From the information received, no concrete explanation is available and the case is carried as unidentified.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It would dim - then appear a short distance away.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes   No   Don't Know...   IF you answered YES, then tell what
It moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

In front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound:   No sound
b. Color:   Varied from yellow to green

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
At high altitude it was about the size of a match head - at low altitude 3 times as large

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

Came directly over head then went north

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
