Dear Sirs:

During a conversation with [redacted], a student at N. C. State, he related an incident in which he and his cousin saw an object(see enclosed drawing) which they could not identify. [redacted] said that he could not remember the exact date, but did say that it was sometime during the first two weeks of September, 1963. Statements(paraphrased and condensed) made by [redacted] about the sighting are as follows:

1. The object was flying NE to SW.
2. We [redacted] and his cousin saw the object while atop a mountain about fifteen miles east of Hendersonsville, N. C.
3. The mountain top is approximately 2500 feet above sea level.
4. The object passed about one-third of a mile above us and about 300 yards in front of us.

5. The object made no sound in its passage from horizon to horizon, nor was there any sound, such as a sonic boom, after it had disappeared from view.

6. The object approached us with its wings parallel to the earth and with the oval (see drawing) facingupwards. As it passed us, it rotated around its central axis so that the oval was perpendicular to our line of sight. After the object had passed, it rotated back into its previous attitude.

7. The object appeared to be flying parallel to the curvature of the earth.

8. There was no evidence of any type of operating propulsion unit.

9. The outside section formed by the division of each wing by the curved line of each wing moved as the object executed its two rotations.

[Redacted] made no estimate of the time that the object took to pass from horizon to horizon, but did state that the object seemed to be moving at an unusually fast speed.)

Sincerely,
