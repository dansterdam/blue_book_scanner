MEMO FOR RECORD                                                6 Jun 1969

SUBJECT:  UFO Sighting of 4 Jun 1969

Dayton, Ohio 45418

At 9:45 p.m. on 4 Jun 69, and a friend were going home when they sighted a light over a housing area development. Miss wanted her friend to follow the light, but her friend wouldn't.

When they got home, they sighted a light("big as a snowball") in roughly the Northwest. The light kept moving about but coming back to the approximate same place. At about 10:45 p.m. it disappeared. (There was supposedly a star to the right and below the object that was still visible.)

Sometime during or after the light in the Northwest disappeared, the observer also saw 8 triangular objects. (Wants 2 forms - one for her and one for her friend.)
