MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 4 Jun 1969

Dayton, Ohio 45413
At 9:15 p.m. - 9:40 p.m. on 4 Jun 69, a friend and I were going home when they sighted a light over a housing area development. This light kept moving about but appeared to follow them home. When they got home, they sighted a light ("big as a snowball") in roughly the northwest. This light kept moving about but coming back to the approximately the same place. At about 10:45 p.m. it disappeared. (There was supposedly 1 star that was also visible that was still visible.) Sometimes during or after the light in the northwest disappeared, the observer also saw 3 triangular objects. (Wants 2 forms - one for her and one for her friend.)
