UFO 1. I DO NOT DOUBT THE SINCERITY OF THESE TWO YOUNGMEN BUT WISH TO POINT OUT THE MANY LIGHTS NEON AND OTHER WISE IN THAT DIRECTIO. ALSO THE NAVAL OPERATIONS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ONN RADAR SCOPES OF THIPS UNDER JURISDICTION. I SSNT A PREVIOUS MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM THEM ON 25 OCT 1965. THEY COULD BE VERY UMF.O.CONSCIOUS. RAMSY HAD NO AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY OF ISLA GRANDE AT THIS TIME AND GCI AT PUNTA SALINAS, APPROX 5 MILES FROM THE NAVY STATION, WAS NOT OPERATING AT THIS TIME.

PART IV. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS NEEDS ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION.
