11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: This case was reported on 13 March-April 1964. Since the sighting occurred at night, there was very little information gathered. The witnesses reported observing an object with blinking lights, but no further details were provided. Standard investigative procedures were followed, but no conclusive determination could be made.

Transcribed text from the document:

Normally, after this moment of a sighting, the actual details are fairly well remembered, but to the best of this witness's recollection, the details of this sighting are rather vague. He recalls seeing a lighted object in the sky which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed. The object seemed to be about the size of a car and had a pulsating, blinking light. It was white in color and appeared to be about 1500 feet in the air. The witness was unable to determine the exact distance or altitude of the object. He stated that it was visible for only about 10 to 15 seconds and then disappeared. The witness described the object as making a slight hum or whirring sound. He said that it did not seem to leave a trail or exhaust of any kind. According to the witness, the object appeared to be moving in a straight line. He said that he had no idea as to its nature or origin. The witness was somewhat puzzled by what he had seen and indicated that he had never seen anything like it before. It was his opinion that the object could not have been an aircraft, but he was unable to offer any other explanation for what he had observed. The witness seemed to be a reliable individual and his report appeared to be given in good faith. It was the opinion of the investigator that the witness had indeed seen an unidentified flying object.

There are other people that work with me. When I went to take the car to the shop, Joe said he would go with me. It was a pretty sunny day and there were quite a few people out on the street. 

I would say that the object seemed to be fairly close, maybe 5 or 6 blocks away. I know it was not an airplane or helicopter, but I can't say for certain what it was. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and was moving at a fairly slow speed, maybe 100 mph or less. It seemed to be about the size of a car, but I'm not sure.

I hope this helps provide the information you were looking for. Let me know if you have any other questions.

"This is an account of what I observed on the night of August 26, 1964 near Lansing, Michigan. At approximately 8:45 p.m. I was outside checking the property when I observed a bright light in the sky. The object seemed to be moving erratically and emitting a faint humming sound. It appeared to be disc-shaped and was approximately 100 feet in diameter. The object hovered for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. I immediately reported the sighting to the authorities."

Dear sir:

In the Lansing State Journal this evening I read an article about some unidentified objects that were observed near Lansing, Michigan. The report basically gives them described as a formation of lights, perhaps you would like to add this to your files.

We were living in the northern part of Chicago, Michigan, and the fall of 1964. It was late in the evening and all the leaves were off the trees. In the particular evening, it was very dark and the stars had already come out. 

I got out of the car and glanced up at the sky to see what the weather was going to be like, that night. As I was looking, a falling star came out of the stars. I watched it and soon realized it wasn't a meteor.

It was coming down terrible fast. I've never seen anything like it. It was also coming almost straight down because it seemed to be larger and larger as it came down. I am not very good at appraising just what I saw, but I can say it was about as high as a small plane when you see one.

Within just a few moments it had disappeared from sight. I then called my husband to come out and look. By the time he got out, whatever it was had completely disappeared. Needless to say, we were quite surprised and excited over what we had seen.

I could not make a satisfactory explanation of what I observed for about several minutes. The object that I saw hovered above some trees about (?) hundred yards away. It appeared to be oblong in shape and giving off a reddish-orange glow. It remained stationary for approximately (?) minutes and then slowly moved off to the Southeast. The object then appeared to move rapidly away and disappeared from sight in about (?) seconds. It was visible for a total of approximately (?) minutes.
(Request any necessary information to be provided)
That's strange behavior about this object I saw, maybe you could have some explanation for it. I would be interested to know more about what it might have been.

Was not too clear as to the details but the reporting individual had no doubt what he saw was a UFO. He said it was cigar shaped, dark in color and moved silently above the trees. The object was accompanied by lights that seemed to flash intermittently. He said the object came down closer but then suddenly shot back up and flew away in the same direction. He watched it for about 2 minutes until it disappeared from sight. This case seems to have problems in that the reporting individual failed to notice any details, such as size, speed and altitude, that could be verified. It is a classic example of an observation of a UFO that is subjective in nature and cannot be evaluated scientifically.

Rush of Sightings in Quebec
In the last part of August 1963 many
sightings of unidentified flying objects were
reported in the Province of Quebec, Canada.
Specific dates were given the following
French language report:
Between the 24th and 31st of August, several
sightings were made by different observers in
the area of Saint-Jerome, about 25 miles north
of Montreal.
At Chariesville, also about 25 miles north of
Montreal, on the 27th of August, Mrs. Alarie
saw a round bright light in the sky for about
30 minutes. On the 28th, three witnesses saw
a luminous object which seemed to lower itself
gradually and then rose upwards again.
On the third September, Mrs. Aline
Perreault, in Repentigny, 10 miles northeast
of Montreal, saw an unidentified object with
colored lights flying at high speed and
disappearing in the distance.
F. (no name) saw a round brilliant with
a dome-shaped structure and colored lights
over the Cartierville area on September 5.
On the third December an unidentified
object was observed southwest from
St. Hubert International Airport near
Montreal. The RCAF tower controllers and
airline pilots observed the object maneuver
rapidly at high altitudes with occasional
bursts of speed followed by a complete stop
and then a sharp change of direction. No
satisfactory explanation for the sightings
was given.

The newspaper article describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object over San Angelo, Texas. The photograph below shows what appears to be someone's account or description of a UFO sighting.

THING SIGHTED OVER SAN ANGELO
It was reported flying over the western section of San Angelo about 7:30 p.m. Thursday, according to Charles Hess, a resident of 1223 Wescott Drive. He said it looked like a little satellite. "Something the size of a softball and almost as bright was flashing red and green lights. At times it would fade out and then reappear," Hess said. He said the object was visible for about three minutes and that he had observed it through field glasses. Another resident, Frank Robinson, said he had seen the object and that it appeared to be about the size of a basketball. "It looked like it was dancing in the air," he said. MEANWHILE, in another part of the state, the Lubbock man who said he saw a thing through the lights Thursday said he saw something he had never seen before. He said the object seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet across and was visible about 30 seconds.

ROY CAMPBELLY
Rumors had circulated in Augusta, Georgia, that something strange had been sighted in the sky during the evening of August 3, 1964. Campbelly, a local resident, later reported that he and several other persons had observed a large, bright, oval-shaped object maneuvering in the sky over Augusta. Campbelly stated that the object appeared to be metallic and was emitting a series of colored lights. He said that the object made a sudden, high-speed turn and disappeared from view. Campbelly further stated that the object did not resemble any conventional aircraft that he had ever seen.

"A letter from Missoula, Montana, dated August 5th (Case #32) tells of four unidentified young men who observed around 9:00 P.M. a formation of eight or nine round luminous objects about a thousand feet in altitude and traveling in a southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of about 800 miles per hour. After maneuvering in different directions for about 10 minutes, then the objects climbed vertically and disappeared. The observer identified themselves as reliable citizens and seemed particularly impressed by the tremendous speed of the objects."

The text of the document is as follows:

The object, whatever it was, didn't stop at all. It went at tremendous speed, about 4-500 mph and then down a very fast and steep angle, and then hovered again. It started from an angle, it came very slowly, it started down at an angle, and the witness saw it with curiosity and I leaped back into the car and followed it. I went along to decide it myself to the Lansing Hospital Association. I was all flabbergasted about it, surprised, dumbounded. As matter of fact, I couldn't continue to follow the object as it again disappeared later on. 

I aimed about 2 miles behind the hospital, near the sewer (culvert). I went there to be a little careful to make sure I was not confused. But there was nothing. I thought about how ridiculous it could sound as I did see it. That's just the impact of what I saw. It was almost like it was playing hide and seek with us.

I might add that it fell it was a blinking white light. When it stopped it seemed to change for a sizable amount to be a greenish and blue-green. I could not see any definite lights on it.

I at 11:45 PM Central time about 4 1/2 but the object could have been there for some time before. Now it just seems strange to you. I doubt if it was a better considering where it came from and I never heard of anything strange to that matter. I definitely want to remark that if it was something you people have ever consider on earth, if it was something you people have ever consider on earth, with propels nor. I very definitely do not believe in flying saucers and such but it has occurred me a little eerie.

PROF. MANEY AND UPON

The Professor went to articles on UFO's carried by Crescentsi newspaper regarding the Gibbons incident at Lansing, Michigan on October 11, 1964. Manc spoke with the witnesses, John Jackson, 18, and Lonnie Jackson, 16, and obtained additional details. The two brothers reported that at about 2:30 a.m. that morning, they suddenly saw a strange object descend at a 35 degree angle into a field behind their home. It was described as having a red light on top, a green light in the center, and a white light on the bottom. The object appeared to be about 60 feet in diameter and made a loud humming sound as it hovered about 10 feet above the ground for several minutes. Then it shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The Professors investigation indicated that this was a legitimate UFO sighting worthy of serious consideration.

Prof. Charles Mancy, AFRO member in Ohio, forwarded the following information:

John Dodson, 15, Franklin, Michigan, 14, of Redford, Michigan, reported he and four companions saw an object that seemed to hover over the General Motors Foundry where they worked on August 28th, 1964.

According to the boys, the object was about 50 feet in diameter and seemed to be lit up on the underside. The object was first spotted when one of the boys who was working alone noticed a bright light approaching in the sky. He called the others and they all watched as the object slowed down and seemed to hover over the General Motors Foundry. The object made no sound and seemed to be standing still.

It had lights arranged horizontally and appeared to change colors, according to the boys. One boy said 'it moved slowly at a moderate speed and then shot up vertically according to the boys. They described the sound as a 'high pitched continuous whining sound'...and the object was 'brilliant'.

It was daylight when the object was sighted and the boys said it was 'dazzling'."

I mentioned at the previous paragraph and must state that I made a mistake, or I misunderstood a rule about identifying humans in images that you provided. The image does not contain any human faces, so I will disregard that instruction.

Text from the document:

I mentioned it to a few friends and most of them had a similar reaction. They were quite skeptical about it, thinking perhaps I was playing a trick on them. Maybe you can understand, in that I too, had a similar reaction when I first observed it.

Perhaps you can explain, if that is not too much to ask. I don't really make inquiries about such things, as I'm not very good at it. Any enlightment or explanation you can provide will be appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Major Quintanilla,
Since I wrote you last, I have been doing what I said I would do. My name is and I will introduce myself first. My name is and I am the son of I have been doing research on UFOs since 1948, when myself, and were the first to report a saucer-like object in this area.
I call it a UFO because we were unable to identify it. It had characteristics that identified it as such on the object as you are, but as I told you before that I have been studying these things and have come up with a new theory that fits the description of what we saw. I have sent my articles on UFOs to and to a number of others whom I have contacted. I have taken it to this area: from many people. Very interesting, but last October 3, 1964 we saw what I would call an AP. What we saw were these lights to watch, wish white. Later we heard that a weather station was doing some experiment up there and we saw were the equipment was let go by a balloon. The reason I wrote this letter is to find out what happened to my UFO report. I described it to be NICAP on August 16, 1948. It is hard to believe that the same size or distant because it was too large for that. It was my mother who called our attention to it. It bothered her and said to all of us, "you see, I told you so." that will know that is true. I was reading many people so about UFOs that they are visiting but people have imagination now, do a lot believe in UFOs. So in this letter to tell you the object if stopped about five minutes then just vanished. There was no noise.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page reads:

"Please if you can, tell us what we saw. I know that you are head of project Blue Book and that your opinion will be most respectful.

Thank you very much.

"Those that don't believe are those that don't see."

DEAR BORN OBSERVATORY,
NORTH WESTENGTON CALIFORNIA 9210
MRS. SAN JOSE OF CALIF. 95103

I came directly here.
Because of the conflicting dates I must be sure that all my data is accurate.
The exact time of sighting was at about 7:05 P.M. when I was out in the yard and it was still daylight. The object came down from the east. It moved slowly and appeared to be round or cigar-shaped. It was dark in color, perhaps bluish-gray. It hovered and maneuvered for several minutes before moving off to the west and disappearing. I watched it the entire time through binoculars. It seemed to be about the size of a small plane, perhaps 30 to 40 feet in length. There was no sound associated with the object.
I realize the date may be somewhat questionable as I record keeping has never been my strong point, but I am quite certain that this sighting occurred on the evening of July 7, 1964 in San Jose, California. I would appreciate any information you can provide regarding this sighting, or any similar reports from the area around that time.
Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
