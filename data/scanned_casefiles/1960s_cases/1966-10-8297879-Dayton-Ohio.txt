                                                    Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

During the more than 20 years I spent in the AF under my various aeronautical qualifications I have never observed anything of this nature. I have flown most everything from a Piper J-3 to jet fighters. The Aurora Borealis is no stranger to me after flying in Canada and Alaska. In over 100 combat missions I've seen many windshield reflections. I've also observed Radiosonde balloons.

But this, particularly considering my wife's qualifications and conformation, is without precedent in our experience.
In conclusion let me say that I must apologize for not having replied to your request for information sooner.

Major Quintanilla I must add that I do believe in UFOs - or some logical explanation of the many observations - other than "swamp gas." This is my first and only report, but I would hasten to assure you that, whatever I may personally believe, it has not been influenced by that. I've been through enough de-briefings not to try, or want, to "snow" anyone.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Moved to SW in straight path

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? _____________
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document also contains a compass diagram and an illustration showing angle measurements from 0° to 90°, with a figure looking at an object against a landscape background.

Astro (CAPELLA) ✓

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a yellow oscillating light in the north-eastern sky for over 30 minutes. The yellow light appeared to move back and forth as it very slowly traveled toward the east. The object was still there when the witnesses went into the house. The observer estimated that the object was quite distant.

CAPELLA was low on the horizon at the time of the sighting. CAPELLA, a yellow star, with a stellar magnitude of 0.2 would have been quite visible to the observers.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I noticed the stars which were clearly visible on that night. Not new stars flickered on the move. There were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky.

This was not an airplane, in the first place they do not fly that high up in the sky. Normally, I would have been more normal being sure if it had been so clear a night identifying it as an airplane.

Not what a stars, this I know, for stars do not move.

I don't know what it was, but I am positive that it wasn't any of the above mentioned items. Other people saw; and can testify to my above statements.

If you do find out what it was, I would appreciate it if you would let me know.

10. CONCLUSION
Astro(Jupiter) Prob. Ident.
Jupiter was on azimuth of 80 degrees and at an elevation of 19 degrees.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a bright blue colored object in the eastern sky. The object was much brighter than the brightest star. The object dimmed and brightened slightly 15-20 times. At the first sighting, the object gradually dimmed out of sight without changing location in the sky. Observer compared the unknown to a star but was a definite blue. Object did, for a short period, move in a small circle.

Jupiter was rising in the east and with a stellar magnitude of -1.75 would have been the brightest object in the eastern sky. The star Sirius was also rising in the southeastern sky, but the description of the object is more consistent with that of a sighting of the planet Jupiter.

PROJECT 1007 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 26 Oct. 66  26/0352
2. LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio (two witnesses)
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: SW
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Aircraft (possible)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched cylindrical shaped object move off toward the southwest and disappear into a cloud cover. The front part was a white light and the rear part had a red light. The red light pulsated in intensity as the object moved. The unknown had a constant direction and constant speed.

Description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. The flashing red light could have been the anti-collision light that all aircraft must have in operation when in flight.
