1. In accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2, the following report on UFO sightings is submitted.

2. At 1830 on 9 April 1966, Miss Regina McFadden, 1838 N. 22nd Street, Philadelphia, Penna, contacted the Security Office of this installation and reported an object in flight over the North Philadelphia area which she said did not resemble a plane. Miss McFadden could not be contacted by this office for further details until the present date. When contacted, she provided the following information:

Shape - Circular
Size - Larger than the visual image of the sun
Color - Bright Orange
Number - One
No trail or exhaust
No sound

The object appeared to hover just over the buildings while moving slowly in a northerly direction. Object was observed at approximately 1430 zulu (1630 Philadelphia time). Object was maintained in sight for approximately ten minutes. No further details were available from the individual. Miss McFadden was walking in a direction generally north near her address at the time of sighting and was accompanied by a sister and brother-in-law. Addresses are not available.

3. At 0845 hours on 12 April Mrs. Robert Curran, 7710 Fayette Street, Cheltenham, Penna. a northern suburb of Philadelphia, reported observing a flying object at approximately 1050 zulu time proceeding in a southerly direction along the line roughly from Willow Grove Naval Air Station to Philadelphia International Airport. Mrs. Curran whose husband is a Flight Engineer, stated that she was familiar with aircraft and felt that this was definitely not one. She was awakened by a very disturbing noise and observed the object which seemed to have a red light in

Dear Sir:

I understand any sighting of unidentified flying objects are to be reported to the U.S. Air Force. If this is not handled by your office, will you please forward the following to the proper department.

On Tuesday evening, April 5, 1966, between 9:10 and 9:15 P.M. E.S.T., I observed an object of unusual conditions, while traveling north on the Schuylkill Expressway, at a point about one quarter mile north of the Girard Avenue Bridge and slightly west of the expressway, there was an object in the sky. Throughout the observed period, approximately 1 minute, I observed no movement to any degree of the object. It appeared stationary, almost suspended in height about 500 feet above the ground. I noted three distinct red lights on its apparent oval or football-shaped center section extending from the nucleus. There were two wing like extensions. At the end of each wing was a very intense light that periodically went on. Every four seconds there was an for approximately a half second duration, then went out for about 4 seconds again. The wing span was about that of a Piper Cub but only about 3 feet wide. The hub or center section appeared to be about 15 feet by 10 feet in an oval shape.

Outside of the 5 lights there was no glow of the object from the bottom view.
