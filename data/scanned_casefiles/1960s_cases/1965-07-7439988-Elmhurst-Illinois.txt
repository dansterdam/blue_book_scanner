Four-legged object
From the Johannesburg Star of July 22, the information that Mr. F. M Perrish of Elsburg, Germiston, has reported seeing a strange object on July 21, at home, he watched it for some time. The object was described as being about four feet long, as reddish in colour but seemed to change to green. It moved up and down and then darted sideways and at one stage two blue lights appeared to approach it and later disappeared.
Mr. Perrish thought at first it might be some kind of 'spies or legs below it. It moved faster than any aircraft he had previously seen.

On the 21st and 22nd, sightings were made in the Columbia River Basin in Washington. Franklin County Undersheriff Irvin Monda interviewed 10 people who saw the objects. He said they were glowing objects flying at low altitude north of Ringold. The objects had been seen on Wednesday and Thursday of the two preceeding weeks. Hood said all the reports were similar, describing orange, glowing objects, flying in a group. Some observers said they saw mountains or objects that could not have been planets or satellites. The Othello Radar base confirmed an object's course, saying it might be pointed out that in hilly or mountainous country, radar will not pick up low-flying objects.

Lima Peru

FLYING SAUCER LANDING IN PERU: A wire service story dated July 24th tells us of a UFO landing on a ranch 50 miles from Lima, Peru. Witnessed by a chemist and his wife, the story says they saw a saucer-shaped object come down in the area and after about 45 minutes the object took off, leaving behind several flattened rocks in the area supposed to have supported it. Several farmers in the area reported to in the article, but no details are described. Meanwhile, a group of men in Peru described a "scientist" who have sighted this flying saucer do exist, and are pictured by beings 5.3 feet tall who are generally similar to us in physical characteristics. The conclusion we are tentatively reaching from the available information is that their conclusions are basically correct, but that caution is necessary since it is round to us like a saucer research group familiar with such sensational reports: and although we agree that their conclusion is basically correct, we must caution our readers that it seems rounded to us like a saucer research group familiar with such sensational reports. 

Lima during the same preceding July 24th, it is obvious that a rind of unusual close encounters has been taking place in Peru, as well as in other South American countries.

Carcas, Venezuela, July 25th. Mr. Ismael Ramos Martines reported that on this date at 8.p.m. he saw a disc-shaped object from the window of his home at Guaicaipuro. He called his mother and sister who also saw the object and reported the object as an orange red, moving at a high velocity and estimated the sighting time at 5-7 minutes. The object did not speed, taking 6 or 7 minutes to cross the sky. It moved in a straight line, weaving to the southwest just before it veered sharply upward. Mr. Martines watched the sky until 10:30 p.m. but he then saw a fast-moving brilliant point of white light which flew from northeast to southeast. He called his sister and they watched the light as it flew rapidly in an ellipse trajectory. Then it disappeared upwards.

Dear Sirs,
I am writing to inform you of a strange U.F.O. sighting at February 23, 1965.
We were driving home on the highway at about 9:30 p.m. and noticed a bright light in the sky, stationary at first, then it started moving slowly. It would stop and start again, moving in an erratic manner. The light was very bright and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air. We watched it for about 15-20 minutes and it eventually disappeared in the distance.
We have related this incident to many persons, but of course none can verify it as no one else seems to have seen it. If just anyone could write, it might be of some value.
I hope this report will be of some interest to you. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely yours,
[Name redacted]

Text extracted from the document:

"I got a white cigar shaped craft, started to climb and hover above the trees, then shot straight up and disappeared. It was absolutely silent and about 60 feet long, rounded at each end and about 18 feet thick in the middle. As it shot straight up it seemed to go out of sight instantly, with no trail or noise. I called my wife out to see it but it had already disappeared.

I wrote Mrs Ethyl Culver of 244 East St. and Capt. Baxter of the local police regarding this incident, my little cousin Dorothy Thornton was with me at the time and we both saw the same thing."

Text from the document:

At 11:52 p.m. on the date stated above, I was awakened by my daughter who had noticed an unusual light in the northern sky, hovering and stationary for about 10-15 minutes. It was a very bright light, more intense and larger than any star. In my opinion it has to be some type of Unidentified Flying Object.

In the field I observed it to be much larger and brighter than the surrounding stars and planets. I watched the object very steadily until it apparently left the area. My wife also witnessed the object and we have discussed it.

We both agree that the object was about 40-50 degrees above the horizon to the north and was round in shape, larger and more intense than any known celestial body. Without me making a word, it appeared to my wife to be the same object I was describing. We watched it for about 10 minutes without it moving from its position.

The light was not pulsating nor blinking, but maintaining a steady bright white light. It seemed to be rotating or spinning slowly. The light illuminated the surrounding area and cast shadows on the ground.

There were no sounds associated with the object. It gave the impression of a structured craft, possibly metallic, although I could make out no details as to its construction. The object gave off no exhaust trails nor did it appear to enter or leave the atmosphere. It just seemed to fade out of sight, possibly by moving away.

I cannot say with certainty just what the object was, but I can state positively that it was not an airplane, satellite, star, planet or any other known object in the night sky. I have observed many types of aircraft, and this did not resemble any of them.

The text in the document reads:

"whether they were successful in their quest. One official questioned whether or not the whole thing was stag-ed with intent to make some point or raise some questions. The object remained stationary, hovering, and then disappeared or moved so fast that it was lost to sight very quickly. It had the appearance of some kind of metallic or silver object, circular in shape and about the size of a hub cap. The witnesses were adamant that what they saw was a real and meaningful sighting. The persons making the report requested that their names not be used, as they feared ridicule or criticism for having made such a report. They were merely people with no particular interest or expertise in such subjects, but felt impelled to report what they had seen, since it was a highly unusual and inexplicable experience for them. It would seem that this report, like many others, merely adds to the general mystery and confusion surrounding the UFO phenomenon. There is little concrete and definitive information to be derived from it, but it is included in the file as one more example of the many reports which continue to come to the attention of Project Blue Book personnel."

"Reports show that investigation had been conducted.

A man at the airport had seen the complete fade off of object at the airfield. An expert said what we seen was very possibly, the airplane glider. But I can't certain beyond a doubt that what we seen was a glider. What that (not tried., Must have been a U.F.O.) And it was no other. Persons are now keeping watch on the night and if anything happens up they will report it immediately in the right channels. Of that we shall speak."

AUSTRALIA
UFO BUZZES CAR
From the 17 August 1955 edition of
the Northern Territory News, given to
us by Mrs. A. Lawrence of
Northern Territory Pensioners Union, Australia.
The following is the story of their
experience with a U.F.O. on the night
of 27 Jul 55, Carnavon, Australia.  
It was 7.55 p.m. on July 27, about 70
miles south of Carnavon at the southern
end of the North-West coastal road. Mr. and
Mrs. A. Lawrence were returning to their
home in Carnarvon. A bright green object
seemed to dive straight toward their vehicle. It appeared to be
about 30 feet or so in diameter and there
appeared to be portholes or lights around
its edge, and a sort of central light. It made
a high-pitched whining sound and a
red-orange glow lit up the interior of the
car when the object was close. It stayed in
that position for about half a minute,
then shot away at tremendous speed out
of sight. Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence watched
it through their rear window as it went. The
object did two slow circles around the car
and then went straight up and out of sight
in about 5 seconds. It made no sound as
it went up. They are both certain that
this was no aircraft or any other normal
object. If it had been an aircraft it would
have been seen to land or take off in the
area. It came close enough for the
Lawrences to see details of shape and
lights, and they felt the warmth of the
red-orange glow in the car. So they are
convinced that it was a genuine UFO.

Lima, Peru

At 3 a.m. in the morning of the 27th at Lima, Peru, Mr. Prosper Alva, an employee of the Citizen Electric Company, observed a strange object in the sky which made a noise which sounded like "bubbles and bumble bees". It was inside a building and looked out a window. The object was about four meters in diameter, round and shaped like a tank, with holes all over it. Mr. Alva got the impression that the revolving arms was some sort of scanning device. The object was on the ground about 1.5 meters from Alva's position. After a while, the object moved slowly and silently to the right, then came up moving rapidly, and after hovering at great speed it disappeared into the night sky.

The witness, named Francisco Rivas, said that it looked "like a huge glowing cigar-shaped silver object hovering over the landing site." As the object landed, the woman said she "became frightened and disappeared into the house." Suddenly the machine moved to the side and took off, moving slowly at first and then at great speed, until it disappeared into the night sky.

In Portland and Salem, Oregon and Spokane, Washington, on the night of July 29, 1965, several objects "hovered" in the sky. One individual described a bright green, dinner-plate sized object descending rapidly. According to the individual, the object "was the size of a dinner plate", he said, and appeared to extinguish itself before ascending rapidly. The incident was reported from Portland International Airport, where an official said there was a flashing light in the sky from the south end of the field.

A retired Army Captain pointed out that Spokane had a report of 5 objects which "hovered" over the city and maneuvered rapidly, and a man from Seattle who was visiting Spokane had reported seeing an object and a group of 11 others watched the objects one in the northwest and one in the southeast, flashing on and off, into position and then began blinking their lights, which moved slowly into position and then became blinking lights.

The final object was observed at 1:30 a.m. on the 31st. He said a third object hovered near the other two for a short period, prior, a Spokane County Deputy Sheriff reported observing objects which were white in color with red overtones. No further details.

AIR FORCE INVESTIGATION
RESULTS
According to information received from Projjbct Blue Book Headquarter - 
on 27th September 1965, the following results were reported.

There have been released by Station WWW again "Air Force Investigation reports which were previously withheld from the public. These reports cover incidents that occurred on August 10, 16, and September 5, 1965 in Oklahoma.

The September issue of the UFO page 120 in the Air Force Regulation 200-2 clearly stated that the Oklahoma incidents were being "Investigated and Evaluated."

The Wynnewood, Oklahoma sightings were on August 10, 1965. Three witnesses, two Oklahoma State Highway Patrolmen and one private citizen, stated that a large luminous object was observed. The radar returns that were picked up at Tinker AFB, Ft. Worth showed that the object was tracked to a range of 20 miles to the south. 

The object was tracked by Tinker AFB radar at a range of 20 miles south of Oklahoma City. The radar returns show that the object was picked up at Tinker AFB, Ft. Worth and that no unusual returns were recorded at that time.

All other returns from the Oklahoma City area were identified as normal aircraft.

The radar returns from the 7150th Air Division, Oklahoma City, on August 16, 1965 were in the range of 20 miles to the south. The object was tracked to a range of 20 miles. The objective was tracked to a range of 20 miles.

The majority of the visual reports were to the effect that the object was first seen in the northwest, moved to the southwest, and was last seen in the southeast. 

As stated by Major Quintanilla, release on the cause of the initial reports published in the September issue of the UFO page 120 in the Air Force Regulation 200-2 was a malfunction. This situation was multiple image sightings. Colorado and Nebraska area on the night of the 16th of July.

The incident at Wynnewood was under investigation by the Air Force and during this period we had no knowledge of reports from the Oklahoma area.

As you may know, telephone Wright-Patterson AFB on the morning of August 20th of the release that a full report was delayed for several days. As soon as the Air Force investigation results were made known, this information was released.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
21 July 1965
Mount Airy, North Carolina

On the basis of reports sightings of "unidentified flying objects" gathered and evaluated, the following case is presented:

An NC 747 Fairchild cargo plane, registered N37568, piloted by Captain Douglas Parker, co-piloted by First Officer F.M. Lowry, was flying from Washington, D.C. to Atlanta, Georgia at 10,000 feet altitude over Virginia on July 21, 1965. The plane had just passed over the Shenandoah National Park area west of Charlottesville, Virginia when the pilots sighted an unidentified object bright enough to be seen against the bright daylight sky. The object was described as round or circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and giving off what appeared to be a bright glare or reflection of sunlight. It was observed for about 15 seconds at a distance estimated to be 10-15 miles. The object appeared to be stationary and remained at about the same altitude as the DC-747 cargo plane.

The pilots informed the CAA (civil Aeronautics Authority) air traffic control at Washington National Airport of their sighting, and a CAA controller confirmed the presence of the unidentified object on radar. The CAA controller said the object was stationary and at the same altitude as the aircraft.

The pilots stated that the object was estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be metallic and was reflecting bright sunlight. The pilots were definite in their opinion that the object was not an aircraft, balloon, or other known object. They indicated that the object was at their 10 o'clock position and appeared to be hovering or stationary. After about 15 seconds the object seemed to accelerate at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. No sound was heard by the pilots.

The CAA control tower radar confirmed the presence of the unidentified object and said it was stationary at the same altitude as the aircraft. However, the object disappeared from radar at the same time the pilots lost sight of it.

A preliminary investigation by the Air Force Adjutant General's Office, who obtained the information from the CAA, did not reveal any known aircraft, balloon, or other explainable object which could have accounted for the sighting.

CASE NO. 5
This case near Washington, D.C. involves a round, silver object approximately the size of a B-29 bomber, which was sighted by a number of witnesses. According to the report, the object was very bright and moved at a high rate of speed. The observers stated that it appeared to be performing "acrobatic maneuvers" as it darted back and forth. After several minutes, the object suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from view.

CASE NO. 2
This sighting occurred in Elmhurst, Illinois and involves a bright light that moved erratically in the sky. The light was observed by several people and was described as hovering and darting back and forth. The observers stated that the light appeared to be under intelligent control and did not behave like an ordinary aircraft. The light eventually accelerated and disappeared from sight.

UFO SIGHTINGS REPORT
UFO REPORT - 7/31/65
WITNESS: 25 yr David Francisley
LOCATION: Elmhurst, Illinois
AGE & SEX: 25, male 
EMPLOYMENT: Student, U.S. Navy with
20 years experience.
DATE: 31 July 1965
TIME: 2:45 a.m. All EST

BACKGROUND: The sighting of this particular sighting appeared in the 31 July issue of the Elmhurst PRESS & REVIEW. This object was sighted by the witness and a friend while they were driving along Route 83 in Elmhurst, Illinois. The object appeared as a brilliant light in the sky, at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet, moving at a rapid rate of speed. The witness estimated the size of the object to be about 50 feet in diameter. It was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 seconds.

DESCRIPTION: A brilliant light object was observed, about 50 feet in diameter, moving at a rapid rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. The object appeared round in shape and emitted a pulsating glow as it moved across the sky. No sound was heard. The object continued on a straight course and disappeared from view. The witness attempted to follow the object but lost sight of it in a few seconds.

CONCLUSIONS: Although the observation was of short duration, the reliability of the witness and the details he provided lend credence to this sighting. The object's size, speed, and lack of sound are all indicative of an unconventional aerial vehicle or "Unidentified Flying Object."

EVALUATION:
This was a clear and calm evening. The witness could not determine the size or shape of the object he observed. It was described as being bright and moving rapidly. The witness felt that the object was performing maneuvers which could not be explained as normal aircraft activity. The witness was uncertain as to the nature of the object he observed.

Dear sir:
This is a follow up to my conversation with a member of your staff this morning. As I indicated, I wish to make an informal report of an unidentified flying object I observed at approximately 7:40 pm on 7/9/65. 
The object was gray in color, disc-shaped, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed moving from east to west at a very high rate of speed, approximately 1500-2000 mph. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute and 45 seconds before it disappeared from view.
As I indicated, I realize this report may not be official and may have little value. However, I felt it was important to record my observations, as this is the first time I have observed such an object. 
Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Sincerely,

OAK PARK. ILL. 6-1-65

Dear Major.
Thank you for your letter of june 24th with reference to the unidentified object which I reported seeing on the evening of May 13th.
In the first place, I would like to mention that I am a serious and objective observer, and have no vested interest in the subject of unidentified flying objects. I am simply interested in learning the truth, whatever it may be.
The object which I observed was circular in shape, and was emitting a bright glow, not unlike a fluorescent light. It appeared to be stationary at first, then suddenly shot upward at a tremendous speed, far exceeding the speed of any known aircraft. 
After watching it for several minutes, it disappeared from sight. I have no explanation for what I saw, and can only assume that it was some type of unidentified flying object.
I hope this additional information is helpful in your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further details.
Sincerely,
[Name Redacted]
