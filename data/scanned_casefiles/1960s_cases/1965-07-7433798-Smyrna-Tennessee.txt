1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 13 July 65 14/0540Z

2. LOCATION: Smyrna, Tennessee

3. SOURCE: Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6 - 7 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: South

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Satellite Pos. Apt

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Light that looked exactly like a bright star in flight to SSW from position of overhead. Disappeared about 30 deg elevation after straight flight. No deviation in flight. Witness thought object was satellite. Object passed a star and its same magnitude. This was the brightest star in the sky.

COMMENTS: Altair is the bright star almost overhead at the reported time of observation. Slightly to the East of South and the possibility exists that the flight of the object was SSE rather than SSW. VEGA is also overhead but slightly to the North. ECHO I was over Tennessee at the reported time of observation, however it was low near the horizon and moving to the NE. ECHO I was over Tennessee at 2350ST one hour before the reported time. Object is regarded as a possible Satellite.

FORM: FTD SEP 63-0329 (TDE)

PART II

OBSERVER WAS LYING IN HAMMOCK AND OBSERVED THE OBJECT PASS BY A VERY BRIGHT STAR THAT WAS LOCATED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.

THE OBJECT TRAVELED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED ON A STRAIGHT SSW COURSE FOR 6 TO 7 MINUTES. WAS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ALTITUDE. OBSERVER STATED THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS A STAELLE BUT LATER DECIDED TO REPORT IT DUE TO THE EXTREME BRIGHTNESS AND SPEED OF THE OBJECT. THE STAR IT PASSED WAS IN HIS OPINION THE BRIGHTEST IN THE SKY AND THE OBJECT WAS JUST AS BRIGHT BUT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CONTRAILS OR STREAM AS SEEN WITH SHOOTING STARS. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WILL FOLLOW BY LTR AS INFO COLLECTED.
