I OBSERVED THE PHENOMENON FIRST ABOUT 2/3 OF THE WAY UP TO THE MOON AND IN A VERTICAL LINE BELOW IT. THE APPEARANCE AT FIRST WAS OF A VERY BRIGHT STAR. I WAS UP STAIRS TO ALERT THE REST OF THE FAMILY. MY SON WAS ALREADY WATCHING IT.

THE PHENOMENON THEN APPEARED LARGER, ROUGHLY RECTANGULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT THE SAME POSITION. IT SEPARATED INTO 3 OR 4 PARALLEL YELLOW LINES, IN THE SAME AERIAL EXTENT. PORTIONS FELL TOWARD THE GROUND, EXTINGUISHING BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND. THE OBJECT BECAME DIMMER AND SMALLER REMAINING DISARRAYED BRIEFLY AND THEN DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY.

THERE WAS NO APPARENT MOTION OF THE OBJECT WHILE I WAS WATCHING IT.

SAF-OICC/Miss Turnure/76526/September 12, 1968

Dear Mr [redacted]

This replies to your letter of September 8, 1968, in which you reported that you and members of your family have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you have seen. However, if such a complete one of the enclosed questionnaires and mail them in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation. It is very important that each member of your family who wishes to report this sighting complete a separate questionnaire; we are not allowed to accept reports of sightings through an intermediary or a second person, but only those that are reported personally by the viewer.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing the observations of my wife, two of my sons and myself of a mysterious object which we saw last night, Sept. 7, 1968.

My son, [redacted] first saw the object and gives the most information on its actions. He was on the second floor of our house, looking out of a window facing the east.

I next saw the object, independently, through a door on the first floor, also facing east. I went upstairs to alert the rest of the family and my wife and second son joinedus to see the final minute or so.

We each wrote down our observations before any discussions, in order to obtain as unbiased data as possible, and I have copied these writeups on the enclosed sheets.

If we can be of any further help in describing this occurrence, we will be glad to do so.

Yours very truly,
[signature redacted]

Observation of object - Sept. 7, 1968

Time:   10:45 to 10:47 PM, Eastern Daylight Time
Location : In vertical line below the moon, about 2/3 of the way up to the moon.

First saw yellow ball stationary, like a bright star.

After running upstairs, object, about the same place, was larger, rectangular. It then separated into 3 or 4 parallel yellow lines. Portions dropped off and one nearly reached the ground before disappearing. Other portions fell and extinguished. Finally the source disappeared, then reappeared as a fainter light for one or two seconds. Then it disappeared again.

It looked like a fire works display - a bright yellow-orange streak high in the sky, slowly breaking up and disappearing from sight.

- Observation of object - Sept.7, 1968

I looked out the window and saw a bright orange-yellow object floating slowly across the sky. After about a minute of its moving across, it stood still for about 15 seconds. Then it started moving toward the moon. It stopped again for about another 15 seconds. After that it started to fall apart, parts falling off and burning out until it was all over

[The document also includes a hand-drawn diagram of what appears to be buildings or structures, with annotations indicating movement and stop times, and markings for "moon" and "15 sec stop 15 sec"]

I was listening to my radio when I was told there was a
U. F. O. When I saw it it was an orange ball. In a
couple of seconds it broke up. I thought it was a
rocket but it fell apart a lot slower, like it was on
fire.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS. NOTE THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
