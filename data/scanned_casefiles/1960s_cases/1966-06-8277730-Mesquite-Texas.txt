Dear Sirs:

On the night of June 11, 1966, at approximately 10:30 P.M. three friends and I saw an object much like a star going across the sky. We first saw it through it may have been a satellite, but we all know a satellite was not like this. After close observation, we noticed that this object could not have been a satellite. The object made three, ninety-degree turns in less than 20 minutes.

It travelled at various speeds, sometimes slowing up, speeding up faster, and even stopping up for approximately three to four minutes before the last ninety-degree turn. After this three-to-four minute stop, the object that in to enter space almost faster than what we could blink our eyes. This speed was such that it was faster than any of us had ever seen. A pattern of the object's course is enclosed and a following page.

How do you explain the object? Also, we would like as much information on U.A.O.'s as you could possibly give.

The four of us graduated from high school and we don't think all of us could have been seeing things.

Two of the four graduated

with honors from high
school. So we think we
did see something, and not
did we write this letter
as a joke.
Thank you!

Sincerely,

P.S. It was a crystal clear
night
