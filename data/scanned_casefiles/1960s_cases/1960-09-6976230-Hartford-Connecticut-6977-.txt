UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTINGS 
HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT
6 September 1960
ABSTRACT:
On 6 September 1960, at about 8:40 P.M., EST, Mr. and Mrs. X were driving south on Route 5 near Hartford, Connecticut, when they sighted an object in the sky to the east. The object was described as cigar-shaped, glowing with a reddish-orange color, and emitting a bluish-white exhaust trail. The object descended rapidly and was observed for about two minutes before disappearing from sight. No sound was heard. Both observers were seemingly credible and their report was considered reliable.

The image provided shows a black and white photograph of a rural landscape. It appears to be a wooded or forested area, with trees and foliage filling the frame. A fence or barrier can be seen in the foreground, running along the bottom of the image. The photograph has a somewhat grainy and aged appearance, suggesting it is an older document.

Project Blue Book was a United States Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. This image seems to be a page from a historical document related to that program, but it does not appear to depict any UFOs or other unusual aerial phenomena.

Under the program, the Air Force collected over 12,000 UFO reports and investigated many of them, though the program was ultimately ended in 1969.

Subject - UFO Sighting Report
Sighting: Hartford, Connecticut, 6 September 1960
NARRATIVE: About 1020 PM on 6 September 1960, two witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. John Doe, were in their car traveling on Highway 10 near Hartford, Connecticut. They noticed a bright light in the sky to the north which appeared to be moving erratically. They watched the light for about 5 minutes when it suddenly disappeared.
Upon arriving home, they reported the incident to the local police. An officer responded and proceeded with the witnesses to the area where the light had been seen. A search was conducted but no physical evidence was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The BLUE BOOK investigation concluded that the sighting was probably of an astronomical nature, most likely a meteor or satellite. No further action was taken.

Case 6976230
Hartford, Connecticut
6 September 1960

On the evening of 6 September 1960, while driving home along Oak Street in the Wethersfield section of Hartford, Connecticut, the witness observed a glowing object, circular in shape, hovering above some trees approximately 1/2 mile away.

The object was first observed at around 9:50 PM while the witness was stopped at a red traffic light. It appeared to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter and was glowing with a bright, white light. The object was completely silent and remained stationary for about 1-2 minutes before ascending vertically at a high rate of speed and disappearing from view.

The witness immediately pulled over to the side of the road and continued to observe the area for several minutes, but did not see the object return. He described the object as having a definite circular shape with no markings or details visible.

The weather at the time was clear with a few scattered clouds. No other witnesses were reported. The Air Force was notified and the case was investigated as part of Project Blue Book. No satisfactory explanation could be determined for the sighting.

Observation of Unidentified Flying Object

On September 6, 1960, at approximately 9:00 PM, I observed a bright orange-reddish object in the sky southeast of Hartford, Conn. The object appeared to be circular in shape and estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately five to ten minutes before disappearing over the horizon.

The object appeared to be stationary at first, then began to move in a straight horizontal line at a moderate speed. It then suddenly stopped and hovered for a short period of time before speeding away and disappearing over the horizon. No sound was heard during the observation.

The sky was clear at the time of the observation with only a few scattered clouds. The object seemed to be at an estimated altitude of 3000-5000 feet.

No other details are available. This report is being submitted for your information and any action you deem appropriate.

Transcript of the text in the document:

On 6 Sept 60 at about 8:30 PM, Mrs. Judith Scoma, age 66, of 233 Rosemont St., Hartford, Conn., was outside her home when she observed a brilliant light in the sky which appeared to be coming towards her. She stated that the light was quite large and bright and appeared to be rectangular or square in shape. She said the object hovered over the trees for a short period, then rapidly accelerated and moved out of sight to the southeast.

Mrs. Scoma stated she was quite frightened by the incident and hurried inside her home. She described the object as having a dull metallic appearance and said it made no sound. She estimated it was about 350-400 feet in the air and approximately 1/2 mile away from her position when first observed.

Investigators visited the home and examined the area, finding no physical evidence or traces. It was an extremely dark night and no other witnesses were located. The case is listed as "Unidentified" since there is no logical explanation that can be determined from the limited data obtained.
