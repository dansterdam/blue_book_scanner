PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 22 Mar 60
2. LOCATION: Vicinity North Platte, Nebraska
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2030L
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
5. DURATION: 5-6 mins
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Three
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-6 mins
8. COURSE: Erratic
9. COMMENTS: The sighting is probably the use of the work lights by the irrigation or mining machinery. An inversion or hazy layer was probably present which resulted in the unusual effects experienced by the two pilots. It is concluded that a mirage of bright stars or ground lights was probably the cause of this sighting.
