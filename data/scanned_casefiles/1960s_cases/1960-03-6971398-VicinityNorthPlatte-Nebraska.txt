10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING                          11. COMMENTS
    Three white lights in line formation, size of       The most important clue in this report
    grapefruit; lights had various intensities and      is probably the use of the work "haze"
    movements. Lights were brighter than surrounding    by the witnesses. An inversion or haze
    ing stars and ground lights.                        layer was probably present which resulted
                                                        in the bright areas on the horizon or
                                                        just below the horizon resulting in the
                                                        effects experienced by the two pilots.
                                                        It is concluded that a mirage of bright
                                                        stars or ground lights was probably the
                                                        cause of this sighting.

YOUR MSG 05 22250, DUD 21 MAR 50. HOW WAS THE SIZE OF THE LIGHTS DETERMINED? WHAT WAS THE ACFT HEADING WHEN THE LIGHTS WERE FIRST SEEN? WAS ACFT HEADING CHANGED BEFORE LIGHTS FIRST DISAPPEARED?

WHAT WAS THE ACFT POSITION WHEN HEADING WAS CHANGED, AND WHEN LIGHTS REAPPEARED? WHAT WAS THE ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH OF THE LIGHTS WHEN THEY APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED EACH TIME? HOW FAR APART DID THE LIGHTS APPEAR TO BE?

AND DISAPPEARED. REAPPEARED APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES LATER AT

10 O'CLOCK OR 24TH DEGREES AT ABOUT 15 TO 20 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON.

LIGHTS CONTINUED TO MOVE TO LEFT DISAPPEARING AND REAPPEARING AT

UNTIMED INTERVALS GROWING AND LESSENING WITH VARIED INTENSITY.

MOVEMENT APPEARED RELATIVELY SLOW WITH LIGHTS DID NOT MOVE ABOUT

THE APPARENT SPEED OF AN AIRCRAFT FLYING SOME 4 MILES ABREAST IN

AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION. F. FOR COMPARISON, LIGHTS APPEARED TO

BE 2000 TO 3000 FEET APART IF THEY HAD BEEN AIRCRAFT FLYING A

LOOSE TACTICAL FORMATION.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Vicinity North Platte, Nebr.
Date: 20 Mar 60     Hour (Z): 22-30
WX Type of Incident: Ground visual sighting of unidentified object near aircraft
Description: While flying in the vicinity of North Platte, observer sighted a bright light slightly higher than aircraft flying in the same direction. Light appeared to be stationary.

Direction of Motion: ERRATIC
Satellite: (AFOIN-143, Phone 69209)   NO CORRELATION   OR
NATURAL - NO SIGHT OF OBJECT

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): METEOR, BULGE OUT
BECAUSE OF ANGLE - NO PLANET OR COMETS IN VISUAL RECORDED

Radar Analysis (AFOIN-421)   NO

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc)   NO

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: PRESENT SECOND - NOTED
NO CORRELATION WITH TYPE OF AD AIRCRAFT

Other: POSSIBLY DUE TO A MIRAGE OR HEIGHT
SIZE OF GROUND LIGHTS

Evaluation of Source Reliability: PROBABLY GOOD

Analysis and Conclusions: THE MOST IMPORTANT CLUE IN
THIS REPORT IS PROBABLY THE USE OF THE
WORD "NEAR" BY THE WITNESSES. AN UNKNOWN
OF 1952 CASE WAS SIMILARLY REPORTED WHEREIN
GROUND LIGHT WEIGHT STARS ON THE HORIZON
WERE SEEN AS A BRIGHT OBJECT RESULTING IN
THE REPORT EXPOSURE OF A MIRAGE OR
VISUAL SIGHTING OF A GROUND LIGHTS WITH PROBABLY
GROUND HAZE OR GROUND LIGHTS WITH PROBABLY
