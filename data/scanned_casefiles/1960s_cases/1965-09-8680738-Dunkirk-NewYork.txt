Dear Sir:

I would like to report a UFO and ask if you possibly will tell me what it was. I was located in the vicinity of Dunkirk, N.Y. on the night of Aug. 28, 1965 at approximately 9:00 P.M. It was in view for about 15 to 20 minutes. I was with some friends and as I was driving, it appeared to have a somewhat circular shape and was very bright. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed and would stop and hover at times. I would like to know if this could be a flying object from another planet.

I was driving west on Route 20 about 3 miles west of Dunkirk and I were observing for about 1 hour. Then about 9:00 P.M. I first noticed this bright object, which was larger than the headlights, and it disappeared. We did not see it go down, and we went on watching it. Then about 1 mile later, it reappeared. While I was observing it, it disappeared and came back again. I was quite positive that I saw something that I could not explain. I would like to know more about the UFO after this occurrence.

I would appreciate it if you could clarify this object for me if you could kindly do so. I am still wondering about the flying object.

Sincerely,
[Signature blacked out]
