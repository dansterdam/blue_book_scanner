This image appears to be a technical graph or chart with a grid layout. The vertical axis is marked with numerical values from 400 to 1000, while the horizontal axis seems to have distance or time markers. The grid is composed of white lines on a black background, creating a complex intersecting pattern. There are two white circular holes on the left side of the document, likely for binding or filing purposes. The image is a black and white scanned document with some slight degradation and shadow around the edges.

The image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The vertical axis is marked with numbers from 0 to 500, and the horizontal axis seems to have similar markings. The grid lines are white on a black background, creating a complex geometric pattern. There are two hole punches visible on the left side of the document. The image is somewhat faded and has some blurring or distortion, particularly in the central area of the grid.

Here is the text from the document:

(3) Object disappeared about 8° above the horizon at 65° azimuth very close by another tree. This tree was 600 ft from the house.

(4) Object was moving very slowly from right to left at tree top level and sometimes appeared to be stationary. It appeared to be quite large and cast a red glow. As it continued to move from right to left, starting and stopping, increasing and decreasing in intensity, it observed that it was now round and as there was no sound she became alarmed and called to her cousin to look at the strange helicoter. She thought it must be a helicopter as it would stop perfectly still every little bit. It began a large round red object when she looked thru the open bedroom window. Seeing the strange object and hearing no sound she also became alarmed and called to her uncle. In the adjoining bedroom to look at the strange object. At this time the object began to make half loops very fast as it continued to move from right to left. It would go straight up move over a degree or so and come straight down to the same level it had started. Then repeat this many times. Then it began make square movements, moving from right to left. It would go straight up, stop for instant, move left level, then stop for an instant, then go straight down to the same level that it began, stop just for a split second and then go left level and pause, then straight up again. It was moving in a square wave pattern. After moving 20° to 25° in azimuth it reversed and made the cross square movement back to the starting point. It would go up, across, and down, in less than a second. As it accelerated and decelerated it would increase and decrease in brightness and change direction 90°. After returning to approximately the starting point it paused, then moved very fast level from 100° azimuth to 95° azimuth then back to 100° azimuth, then back to 95° azimuth, then paused, and within one second. After this flash back and forth it continued to move to the left making square wave movements then reversing and repeating staying between 8° and 15° above the horizon. At this time it passed behind a pine tree, measured 600° from the house, and the red object could be seen thru the top of the tree. Since beginning the fast maneuevering, watched the object. stated that the object looked rectangular to him but tilted away from him. His wife said it was just a big round red light to her.

(5) When the object, moving to the left, came out from behind the tree it was lower on the horizon and suddenly just went out or disappeared as they became aware of the sound of engines of an airliner approaching from the west, which then passed overhead and droned on to the east. Before the sound of the engines faded a jet passed overhead from east to west.

(6) The object was visible for about ten minutes.

c. Manner of observation:
(1) Ground - visual, thru open window, window glass, and thru screen wire.

(2) Binoculars were used by and the (rectangular almost on end) object just became more distinct and brighter.

(3) Observation was made from the ground.

d. Time and date of sighting:
(1) 0520Z, 30 July 1962 to about 0530Z 30 July 1962.
(2) Light condition - night, some stars visible.

e. Location of observers:
(1) 30°27' N 88° 51'W or four NM northeast of Keesler AFB, Miss. 1,000 Ft from abandoned private sod airstrip.

f. Identifying information on observers:
(1) Civilian, age 35; daughter, age 9; Niece, wife, age 15.
Mailing address - c/o Ocean Springs Seafood Co, Ocean Springs, Miss.
Occupation - Salesman and truck driver. Reliability - All members of the family are very sincere, anxious for an explanation, and reliable in the eyes of neighbors as far as I can determine. They were awake at this hour because they had just returned from local church activities.

(2) N/A.

g. Weather and winds-aloft condition at time and place of sightings:
(1) Observers account - stars shining, very light wind.
(2) Report of winds from 8th Weather Detachment, Keesler AFB, Miss.
(a) Surface wind calm.
(b) Winds aloft light and variable, calm.
(3) Ceiling - none.
(4) Visibility - 12 miles.
(5) Amount of cloud cover - 8,000 scattered, high thin overcast.
(6) No thunderstorms.
(7) Temperature gradient - 2° C per 1,000 ft, 28° c at the surface to 0° c at 14,000 ft.

h. None.
i. None.

j. No air traffic at Kessler AFB or Gulfport Municipal airport from several hours before sighting until the next morning.

k. Prepared by Capt Charles O. Williams 47026A, instructor in the SAGE, Weapons Controller Course, OBR1741B. I measured the distance to the trees mentioned and measured the angle of elevation to the top of the trees and the degrees in azimuth to the trees by compass. I asked Mr. [illegible] he had seen anything like this before. He said: "Approximately 12 years ago my wife, [illegible] and I saw an orange object pass at a tremendous speed moving from north to south; and about February 1962 I saw two objects that looked like two moons side by side. I stopped the truck I was driving and observed them for approximately 30 seconds until they disappeared. This happened about 130 miles north of Biloxi, Miss."

I have not been able to determine any possible cause for this sighting. The moon had not yet risen. There were no balloons, search lights, or fireworks. There were no aircraft. There were no temperature inversions.

1. None.

UFO Sighting of 20 July 1962 (Sighting)                30 January 1963

[Redacted] Company
Ocean Springs, Mississippi

Dear Al,

I am writing from Wright-Patterson where the boys are trying to close up the 1962 UFO accounts. They would appreciate, if very much, if you could send them an account of the sighting of 20 July 1962.

I believe you said you had talked to these people and had come to some pretty firm conclusion as to the cause of this sighting. If so, could you drop a line either to me or to Lt Col Robert Friend, FTD TD-2 (UFO), WPAFB, Ohio, or close to the immediate future as possible. There is no point in carrying this sighting as unidentified if it is not.

I hope to see you in Las Cruces.

Cordially,

[Signature area is blank]
