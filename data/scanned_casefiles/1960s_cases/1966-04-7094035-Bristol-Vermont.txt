10. CONCLUSION: Astro(MOON) Very Pos...

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object was sighted in the west or Northeast about 100 feet above the horizon. It was a big round object, Red in color and glowing. It lowered to tree top level, then faded out about 10 minutes after it was first sighted. Could have been the star REGULUS which was at 285 deg, Ag, 0-5 deg. Elevation at that time. However they reported its size to be the size of a silver dollar held at arms length which would be too large for a star. The moon was setting at the time of the sighting. This seems more logical because of the size and the red glowing color.
