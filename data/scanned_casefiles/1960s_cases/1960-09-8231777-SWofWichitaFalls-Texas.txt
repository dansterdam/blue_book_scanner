I. Unidentified Flying Object Observed West of Wichita Falls, Texas on 28 September 1960

1. At 10242 (0424 local), 28 September 1960, a large white streak of light was observed falling through the sky SW of Wichita Falls, Texas. Times of observation by a number of witnesses coincide to such an extent that a conclusion can be made that the same object was observed by all.

2. Statements of Witnesses:

a. [Redacted name], Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. A/2c, AF 16616628, 3763rd School Squadron, RELIABILITY: Good. Seated in [redacted] restaurant at 0400 A.M. local, observed through the NW window of the object was seen through ventilated area maintained a fall parallel to the vertical edge of the window, indicating a perpendicular fall of the object and establishing a direction of due SW of Wichita Falls. Based upon the observer's position within the restaurant and the existence of an awning, on the window, the arc of observation could not have exceeded 25° (from 30° to 5° elevation), although the source estimated a 50° arc. Total time of sighting was estimated to be 3-4 seconds. The object was described as circular, like a ball, without tail, white light with bluish cast similar to phosphorous flare, of an intensity in excess of a falling star and sufficient to light up the sky. No noise was heard. Source estimated that object fell 1 mile from his position, although buildings across the street would have obstructed his view of the horizon. Source believes the object was a flare.

b. [Redacted name], Night Watchman, Robinson Construction Co, Age 48, RELIABILITY: Fair. While on duty at a construction site approximately 5 miles SW of the center of Wichita Falls, Mr. [redacted] stepped out from his guard shack between 4:10 and 4:20 A.M. local and observed a green-blue reflection of light on a chemical tank due West of his position. Thinking that it could have been caused by welders, he turned to face a large storage tank NE of his position. After gazing upon this tank for about 5 seconds and seeing nothing, he turned to the tank West of him and observed a bright green flash of light which appeared to be 30-40 feet above the ground. Total time for the observation was estimated to be 20-25 seconds. No noise was heard. Source stated that had the flash of light lasted longer it would surely have blinded him. Source described the color of the flash to be similar to that of a white light seen through blue-green glass. Source believed the object had fallen about 1/2 mile due West of his position. He was met shortly thereafter by Patrolman [redacted], described below.

c. [Redacted name], Patrolman, Wichita Falls Police Department, Age 23, 18 months service with WFPD. RELIABILITY: Good. At 4:24 A.M. local, while cruising North at 5 MPH Fairway Boulevard just north of the Wichita Valley Railway track intersection, Patrolman [redacted] observed through the glass of the left rear window of his patrol car a bright blue-white light the size of a volley ball that at arms length appeared as a cone of yellow before falling behind the weeds along the roadside. Total time of sighting was estimated at 2 seconds. [Redacted] window was open, but no sound was heard. Two newspapers, the Wichita Falls Record News were in the patrol car and also witnessed the sighting. After reporting the incident by radio to Police Headquarters, they proceeded to a point SW of their position and joined Mr. [redacted], in a search of the area, finding nothing to establish that an object had landed or crashed.

1. Sergeant, Control Tower Operator, Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma. RELIABILITY: Unknown. Contacted by telephone, Sergeant stated that a bright white light was observed falling NE to SW at 0423 A.M. local. Source observed the object for 20-25 seconds.

2. Archer City, Texas. Age 56, unemployed. RELIABILITY: Unknown. Contacted by telephone, Mr. stated a round, white light, larger than the moon, fell WSW of Archer City. Source observed the object through 30° of elevation. About 1/3 of the way down, a piece of the object split off and appeared to burn out, while the main object continued its fall. Object became smaller as it fell.

3. MRS. housewife, Apt C, Wichita Falls, Texas. RELIABILITY: Good. At about 0830 A.M. local, 28 Sep 60, Mrs. observed from the balcony of her apartment a large quantity of billowing matter in long streaks flowing through the sky from SW to NE at an indetermined altitude. A smaller piece of the material appeared to break from the larger mass, talking the form of a ball with string-like streaks. Mrs. watched while the material descended and observed a quantity of the material falling in her front and back yards as well as on the apartment roof. She managed to catch a piece of the material about 3½ x 2½ before it hit the ground. The material had a rubber-like quality and upon contact with her hand, shrank to the size of a 25 cent piece. Mrs. stated she was unaware of the earlier sightings of the falling light when the material was observed.

4. A search of the area 2½ miles SW of Wichita Falls was conducted from 4:20 to 6:40 A.M. by Patrolman (par 2c) with negative results. A helicopter from Fort Sill, Oklahoma joined in the search spending most of the day (28 Sep) in the general area covered by Patrolman and extending progressively more SW of the city, with negative results. On 30 September, the helicopter, with investigators, searched the area in the vicinity of Mabelle and Seymour, Texas to check out the statement of the truck driver (par 2a), without locating an object. Triangulation of the location of fall was made, using sightings from Wichita Falls and Vernon, Texas, the point falling in the vicinity of Seymour, Texas.

4. Comments of Investigators:

There can be little doubt that an object was observed, based simply upon the large number of witnesses. Although individual reports appear to be variation upon a theme, there is assurance that the time was 0423-0424 A.M. local, based upon fairly precise time checks by Clintonman AFB, and by a recording of the sighting by Patrolman upon which the time of the report was recorded in Police Headquarters as 0424 local, 28 Sep 60. Further, certain features appear fairly consistently through most witnesses' statements: a white light, more brilliant than the usual shooting star, falling to the SW of Wichita Falls, with no noise. All reports received place the direction as SW of Wichita Falls' location, except the report from Vernon, Texas (par 2h) which could have been in error. The consensus is therefore SW, allowing for no triangulation. Most witnesses believed the object had fallen a short distance from them, yet the observers were scattered in a triangle with approximately 30 miles to a side. The report from Iowa Park (par 2d) is especially valuable because of the witnessed experience and because he was the only person not preoccupied with driving, talking to someone else, etc.

d. Captain, USAF, Procurement Officer, Sheppard AFB, Age 47. Eight years experience as Intelligence Officer. RELIABILITY: Very Good. While walking South on Farm Road 368, one mile N of Highway 287 in Iowa Park, Texas, Captain observed at about 4:30 A.M. local, a large light 30° above the horizon at an azimuth of 225°. He watched while the object within 3-5 seconds fell to an elevation of 10-20° and an azimuth of 240° at which point the light appeared to burn out. Source was certain the light did not go beyond the horizon. Size of the light was estimated to be equivalent to a thumbnail held at arms length. Color was that of a magnesium flare, with a yellowish tint. The intensity was sufficient to light the ground weakly. No noise was heard. Object appeared to possess a conical tail of a length approximately that of the object.

e. Wichita Falls, Texas. Age 50 years, Independent Truck Driver. RELIABILITY: Fair. While hauling a load of pipe traveling W on US Routes 82/277, 3/4 mile W of Waurika, Texas, between 4:15 and 4:30 A.M. local, Mr. observed through the driver's open window a bright light falling to the ground. Source estimated the object fell for 10-15 seconds, hit the ground at 1/2 - 3/4 mile SW of his position, burned like a glowing coal on the ground for 20 seconds before going out. During flight, object was of such brilliant a light up the fence wires along the road. No sound was heard. Source believes object fell near the road, since he was traveling at about 40 MPH and had to look progressively more behind him to see the glowing object in the ground. A companion viewed the object in flight but saw nothing on the ground.

That he was walking and was able to devote full attention to the sighting, viewing it in relatively open country, lends support to the hypothesis that the object did not land, but burned up in the atmosphere, as he reported.

Further, the absence of noise, reported by all observers, suggests that distance to impact, if in fact an impact occurred, was considerably in excess of estimates. The customary tendency of some observers to overestimate duration of sightings was also noted.

5. Evaluation:

a. It is the preparing officer's opinion that, based upon analysis of the witness' reports, the object seen was probably a meteorite which burned up completely in the atmosphere, but possibly could have landed considerably to the SW of Wichita Falls, perhaps in the vicinity of the Texas/New Mexico border.

b. The material recovered by the Wichita Falls housewife and attached to this report can only be given a tentative evaluation: Possibly floating spider web material. It is felt that the material recovered bears no connection to the meteorite sighted earlier in the morning.

Something was reported as having hit the ground at Sheppard AFB.

Was seen all over that area. Reports coming to ATIC with great frequency. the 1127th Group from Ft. Belvois has been sent to scene.

First report to ATIC said it was seen in the early morning of 28 September and that a search would be started by Sheppard at daybreak.

In addition to personnel at Sheppard investigating, press is on scene, also radio and TV. Nothing on the space track. ATIC has no positive information, but does not believe it to be a moon dust item (this is their vernacular for the refuse of any earth launched satellite, or what have you). People at Sheppard claim they know that it fell in a nearby area. ATIC believes that is meteoric.
