REPLY TO
ATTN OF: CIN

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Hq USAF (AFCIN)     ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. On or about 5 October 1960 at 2100 hours, T/Sgt [redacted] 2500 Air Base Wing, Mitchell Air Force Base, New York, with duty as chauffeur for Lt. General William E. Hall, Commander, CONAC, sighted an unidentified flying object.

2. The sergeant and his son were fishing on the beach at Point Lookout, Long Island, New York (located 4 miles east of Long Beach), when they sighted a bright object appear high in the sky moving from northeast to southwest. At first sighting, the object appeared to pass near the moon, which was full. At the time of initial sighting and while the object was near the moon, a reddish vapor trail could be seen. During this time the object resembled a falling star. As it passed over Point Lookout, it turned to the southeast and then made a wide sweeping turn to the right and eventually passed out of sight going back towards the moon in a northeasterly direction. During the turn, the object appeared only as a bright, very fast moving star with no indications of a tail or vapor trail being present. The turn was wide, extending almost to the southwest and western horizons before going again towards the northeast.

3. The observer said the object appeared to be very high and moving faster than any airplane that he had ever seen. There was no noise. The object was visible only as a continuous white light.

4. The only other known observer was Sgt. [redacted] young son who was with him at the time of the sighting.
