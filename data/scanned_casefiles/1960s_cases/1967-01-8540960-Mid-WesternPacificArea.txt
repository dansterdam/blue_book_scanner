SUBJECT: UFO Report (Msg 90SD-10615 Feb 67)

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. In accordance with AFR 80-17, 19 Sep 66, and supplemental to the above referenced message, the following is transmitted herein:

a. original negative
b. 2 copies prints
c. statements of the observers
d. 2SS Form 5, Baker-Nunn Passage Record

2. Pictures were taken with a USAF SPACETRACK Baker-Nunn camera at Sand Island (Johnston Island) at 22.P/160OZ. (NOTE: Static marks are evident over entire film. Static was caused by personal error; film remained in camera ten (10) minutes after exposure of subject frame. Azimuth from site was approximately 25-28 and elevation 300 above horizon.)

Enclosed statements were made by Air Force and Coast Guard personnel stationed at Sand Island by Capt Del Tonguette, Space Systems Operations Officer, ENT AFB, extension 2677.

22 January 1967

1, DC3 Howard E. SWEETSER 358 950 USCS, was on Engineer-Security Watch at the USCS Loren Station Johnston Island, located on Sand Island in Johnston Atoll from the hours of 0000H - 0300H. At approximately 0500H, 22 January 1967 I sighted an object in the Northeast portion of the sky. Its path of travel was to the West where it hovered over East Island at a low altitude and emitted a bright light from the vapor ring around it. The object was disk like in shape with a small dome on its top. The vapor ring about it was produced by gas given off from it. The object itself was a bright silver, which illuminated the vapor to a light gray. The object gained altitude and the vapor ring was not seen then, and at this time the object moved towards the west and disappeared out of sight around 0530H. Its movement was fast, but you could still distinguish it from a star. The sky was cloudless, but after the object had passed and was out of sight, and after working for approximately 10 minutes, I looked up and the stars were now obscured.

[Signed]
HOWARD E. SWEETSER

The rest of the document appears to be a low-quality, grainy black and white image with very little discernible detail. The image seems to have a bright white area on the right side and some faint lines or shapes in the darker areas, but the image quality is too poor to make out specific details.
