Missile Pass
Cape Canaveral, Florida

Dear Sirs:

I do not know whether or not this imformation is of any value but I read in a newspaper that you wished any news of falling meteorites, satellites or objects. The phenomena I saw was extraordinary I believe.

This object started in the northeast and traveled from the southeast toward the northwest. It was about 45 to 50 degrees high in the sky and started as an object that appeared to be a jet or satellite; a spot about the size of a large orange star. This was at 5:50 P M Dec 22 1960.

After I spotted it, it traveled about 2 or 3 seconds then developed a tail then it became white in a tear shaped ball that appeared to be 100 times its original size. This white spot traveled about 3 or 4 seconds behind this white spot were spots or sparks( very large) that were orange and trailed a long way behind the ball of white. This I estimate took about 3 or 4 seconds and ended at about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought a Jet had exploded but the white spot developed too slowly for an explosion. I shall not try to estimate the distance but possibly you can figure it from the angle and trajectory of its flight. I hope that this information may be of some value to you.

Yours truly,
Buckingham Iowa

12-22-60 5:50 P.M. White light with large sparks trailing. Viewed 7 seconds. Observed from Buckingham, Iowa.
