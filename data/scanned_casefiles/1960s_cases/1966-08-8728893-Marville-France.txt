Glacier NATIONAL PARK
above photo ... Many Glacier Hotel by Marston Lacy

The history of Glacier National Park begins with the Blackfeet Indians who lived under the spell of the majestic mountains. Regarding the mountain vastness with awe they entered this abode of spirits only to fast or to cross to the Flathead country.

The park, lying in a rugged section of the Montana Rockies, is named not from the scenic glaciers of today, but because of the glacial action which carved the rugged scenery of what is now Glacier National Park. Here two hundred glacial lakes and the valleys are are set like jewels in rocky cirques. Streams of crystal clear water

offer good fishing ... and no fishing license required. Brilliant mountain wildfires, falls of Britian mountain waterfalls, dense forests, inquisitive marmots and proud mountain goats make panorama.

Going-to-the-Sun Road, a spectacular scenic drive crossing the Continental Divide at Logan Pass and towering Garden Wall. Much of the park auto and more than a thousand miles of into untouched wilderness or to isolated. Some of the glaciers are visible others are easily accessed by foot or car.

Warm sunny days and cool starry nights throughout the summer. Early season visitors at their most glorious and mountain white winter snows. In the fall, deciduous trees turn to brilliant gold and white dusting of snow and skies descending.

Going-to-the-Sun Road, open about 1 June, remains open well into October, accommodations are conveniently located. Park is open from about June 15 to September 15.

This park was created by Congress as a national park on May 11, the United States section of Waterton-

Yellowstone NATIONAL PARK
Three of the five entrances to Yellowstone, the largest and oldest of all the national parks, are in Montana: (1) the north entrance at Gardiner is reached by the historic Yellowstone River route through beautiful Paradise Valley and Yankee Jim Canyon. (2) the northeast entrance via Cooke City, Montana, which climbs via a series of amazing switchbacks to nearly 11,000 feet in Montana's rugged Beartooth Mountains. (3) West Yellowstone, Montana, gives entrance to Yellowstone National Park on the west ... reached by U.S. Highway 20 and 191 near the Madison River and the world-famed Madison River ... the trout fisherman's paradise.

Yellowstone National Park was first discovered by a frontiersman, John Colter, in the winter of 1807-1808, but his friends refused to believe the tales of the fantastic region he had seen. Later, a rugged Montana trapper and scout, gave similar descriptions of the area, and eventually explored the Yellowstone Country extensively.

Often termed "nature's wonderland", Yellowstone is renowned for shooting geysers, brilliant pools, bubbling mud caldrons, mountains, canyons, streams and lakes.

The Treasure State

Montana, for centuries the home of Indians and buffalo, was first seen by white men—the Verendryes, French fur traders—in 1742.

In 1805-1806, Lewis and Clark explored the area, then part of the Louisiana Territory.

In 1807 Manuel Lisa, a fur-trader, built Montana's first trading post.

St. Mary's Mission at Stevensville, founded in 1841... still standing today.

In 1862 a rich gold strike at Bannack brought a rush of prospectors. With gold discoveries at Virginia City and the surrounding gold camps until the Virginia Territorial days, the surging gold camps and dispersed justice.

The great cowboy era began in 1866 when the first herd of longhorn cattle was trailed in from Texas.

The growing intrusion of white men into the Indians' homeland, the disappearance of buffalo and failure of the government to keep faith with the Indians in the '60's and '70's. Custer's Last Stand occurred in 1876. A year later the major battles ended with Chief Joseph's surrender at the Battle of the Bear's Paw.

The fourth largest state, Montana averages 500 miles in length and 275 miles in width. The Continental Divide runs north and south through the western section. The highest point is Granite Peak, 12,799 feet, the lowest is 1,820 feet on the Kootenai River at the Idaho Line.

The State's mineral resources offer important sources of employment and income to the State. Annual mineral production averages around $136,000,000 from coal, copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, petroleum, minerals are sand and gravel, zinc, silver, building stone, lead and gold.

The timber industry is highly important to Montana's economy and contributes approximately $130,000,000 annually. Principal wood-using industries are paper, and manufactured wood products. Four million more Christmas trees are harvested each year and marketed widely throughout the country.

Most of the power in the State is generated hydroelectrically by the Federal dams located at Fort Peck, Hungry Horse, and Canyon Ferry (Yellowtail Dam near Hardin). Other major hydroelectric facilities include Dam at Nixon Rapids, Holler Dam and 11 other sites.

Manufacturing in Montana is primarily based on the processing of its abundant raw materials including petroleum and copper, with other important industries.

Fishing and Hunting
MONTANA offers some of the best trout fishing in the nation. Four major watersheds—the Missouri, Yellowstone, Gallatin, and Big Hole—plus numerous smaller tribu­taries reaching into the high mountain areas, give the angler a wide choice. Montana's many lakes and streams provide plenty of fish, including the brown, rainbow, cutthroat and lake trout, Dolly Varden, whitefish, the rare grayling, pike, perch, bass, paddlefish, ling and kokance (sackaye). In addition, Montana's vast reaches of native wilderness offer the sportsman a look at untouched country as it was many decades ago.

Herds of antelope, deer, elk, Big Horn sheep, plus moose, mountain goats and grizzly bear have continued to thrive due to careful management. In eleven national forests due west of the Continental Divide, big game hunting of the highest quality.

For the bird hunter, a variety of upland game is available. Species such as the sharp-tailed grouse, sage grouse, blue grouse, Franklin's grouse, ruffed grouse and chukar provide good hunting. Chukar and chukar provide hunters with a variety of enjoyment.

Non-residents may purchase a 6 day limited fishing license for $3 ... or a seasonal fishing license for $10. For non-resident hunters the $100 license includes deer, elk, bear (black or grizzly) plus the right to enter the drawing for a sheep, goats, and moose. The $100 license also includes bird hunting.

The Treasure State

Montana, for centuries the home of Indians and buffalo, was first seen by white men - the Verendryes, French fur-traders - in 1743.

In 1805-1806, Lewis and Clark explored the area, then part of the Louisiana Territory.

In 1807 Manuel Lisa, a fur-trader, built Montana's first trading post.

The permanent white settlement was St. Mary's Mission at Stevensville, founded in 1841 ... still standing today.

In 1862 a rich gold strike at Bannack brought a rush of prospectors. With gold discoveries at Virginia City and Alder Gulch, the Territory's population began to swell, and the surging gold camps followed. Outlaws flourished in the expanding justice.

The great cowboy era began in 1866 when the first herd of longhorn cattle was trailed in from Texas.

The growing intrusion of white men into the Indians' homeland, the disappearance of buffalo and failure of the government to honor treaty obligations marked the decades of the '60's and '70's. Custer's Last Stand occurred in 1876. A year later the major battles ended with Chief Joseph's surrender at the Battle of the Bear's Paw.

The fourth largest state, Montana averages 500 miles north to south and 250 miles east to west. It runs north and south through the western section. The highest point is Granite Peak, 12,799 feet; the lowest is 1,820 feet on the Kootenai River at the Idaho Line.

Climate varies with topography and altitude. Average annual rainfall throughout the state is 15 and varies from a minimum of 66" to over 100" on some mountain slopes. Temperature ranges from an average 0°F in January to 84.5° in July.

Nine railroads, ten bus lines and four air lines serve Montana; 10,693 miles of paved urban, secondary, primary and interstate highways cross the state.

The value of income from farms and ranches totals over $430,000,000 annually. Major crops are winter and spring wheat, hay, barley, sugar beets, corn, oats, potatoes, safflower, alfalfa seed, mustard seed, beans and cherries. Principal livestock are cattle and sheep. Montana is a large supplier of stocker and feeder cattle.

The State's mineral resources offer important sources of employment and income to the State. Annual mineral production averages around $168,000,000 chiefly from petroleum and copper production. Other leading minerals are sand and gravel, zinc, silver, building stone, lead and gold.

The timber industry is highly important to Montana's economy and contributes approximately $130,000,000 annually to the state's economic welfare. Paper, and manufactured wood products. Four million or more Christmas trees are harvested each year and marketed widely throughout the country.

Most of the power in the State is generated hydroelectrically by the Federal dams located at Fort Peck, Hungry Horse, and Canyon Ferry (Yellowtail Dam near Hardin). The Montana Power Company with Kerr Dam, Holter Dam and 11 other sites, and by the Washington Water Power Company with its dam at Nixon Rapids. There are five steam generating plants in the State using coal as a fuel source. The power is operated by the Montana Dakota Utilities Company.

Manufacturing in Montana is primarily based on the processing of its abundant raw materials including refining of copper, zinc, aluminum, and petroleum, production of elemental phosphorus, wood products and cement. Sugar refining and flour milling are also very important. The value of manufactured products approximates $220,000,000 annually.

Additional Information
Wherever you may be in Montana, on-the-spot information is available at the local newspaper office or at a local Chamber of Commerce office. There you will find timely, reliable information about local highlights.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEER/Mr. Bryant/pkj/70401

SUBJECT: UFO Report from Bitburg, Germany (U)

TO: TDEER (Maj Quintanilla)

1. (U) The data submitted is not sufficient to make a firm analysis of this sighting. However, it appears feasible to eliminate aircraft as a possible target, since the speed of 2300 mph is too high for any known aircraft. The target could conceivably be a missile of some type, considering speed alone; but it is highly unlikely that a missile would provide a great radar return at the F-4D altitude, unless it were equipped with a beacon operating at the F-4 radar frequency.

2. (U) Since other F-4D's in the area noted nothing unusual, the only possibilities appear to be either an "angel" or a momentary equipment malfunction. These are offered as possibilities only, since there is no positive evidence supporting either condition.

3. (U) Offered as a remote possibility is an accidental, or perhaps intentional, counter with an ECM deception device. A range and angle deceptive repeater, properly deployed and operated, could conceivably cause the phenomena reported by the aircrew. The U.S. Air Force, as well as the French, are probably experimenting with such devices.

Glacier NATIONAL PARK

above photo... Many Glacier Hotel by Marlon Lacy

The history of Glacier National Park begins with the Blackfeet Indians who lived under the spell of the majestic mountains. Regarding the mountain vastness with awe they entered this abode of spirits only to fast or to cross to the Flathead country.

The park, lying in a rugged section of the Montana Rockies, is unsurpassed for scenic splendor, but because huge Ice Age glaciers carved the rugged scenery of what is now Glacier National Park, there are two hundred glacial lakes stud the valleys or are set like jewels in rocky cirques. Streams of crystal clear water

offer good fishing ... and no fishing license is required.
Fields of brilliant mountain wildflowers, cascading waterfalls, sheer cliffs, dense forests, inquisitive bears, friendly marmots and proud mountain goats make up its changing panorama.

Going-to-the-Sun Road, a spectacular, 50-mile drive running east and west through the park, crosses the Continental Divide at Logan Pass and traverses the towering Garden Wall. Much of the park is accessible by automobile, but much remains accessible only to those into untouched wilderness or to isolated mountain chalets. Some of the glaciers are visible from the roadside; others are easily accessible on foot or horseback. Saddle horses are available; riding experience is unnecessary.

The park offers summer accommodations throughout the summer. Early season visitors find water-falls at their most impressive and mountain peaks still covered with winter snows. In the fall, delicious trees display brilliant colors, highest peaks glisten with their first white dusting of snow and skies descend to a startling blue.

Going-to-the-Sun Road, open about the first week in June, provides access to the park's principal accommodations and conveniently located on the park's fringes. Accommodations in the park are available from about June 10 to September 15.

This million acre alpine wonderland was established by Congress as a national park on May 11, 1910, and is the United States section of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.

Greetings
from
Montana...

Montana, a state which takes enormous pride in its traditions of the past, also looks to the future with genuine enthusiasm.
As an outdoor vacationland, Montana is unsurpassed. Lakes and streams lure the trout fisherman; deer, antelope and elk in abundance attract the hunter; breathtaking scenery and national parks invite campers and skiers from all parts of the country. In Montana slopes to the Continental Divide begin the famous Big Sky Country, Montana is the state where rivers begin and where the ways, clean air aids zest to living. Fine highways cross our state, leading travelers to Glacier National Parks, as well as Custer Battlefield, Virginia City, Lewis and Clark Caverns, Flathead Lake and myriad other attractions.
While zealously protecting its God-given natural resources, State promotion efforts in this field have been rewarding and the state economy is sound.

We invite you to visit Montana often, as a friendly state.
Ask all the questions you like. You'll find our people and our state agencies obligingly willing to answer them.

Sincerely yours,
Tim Babcock, Governor

The image also includes a map of Montana and a landscape photograph with the caption: "The Magnificent Mission Range of the Rocky Mountains towers toward the Big SKY of Western Montana. Photograph by Ross Hart."

There is also a small photograph of a person, presumably Tim Babcock, though I will not identify him specifically as per the instructions.
