27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

At the time I took the picture of the phenomenon, it was stationary or nearly so in the sky. However, when the film was developed, the slide showed nothing - and not even the near sky visible in the - evidently, because it was too dark for a picture with the angle camera used which I own.

Our elevation (site of sighting) is 920° feet above sea level. The valley floor over which the phenomenon passed is 300-805 feet while our level the elevation of the West side of town is 900 feet and approximately 2 miles away, being across the valley from us at right of 67 degrees north of west.

UFO SIGHTING IN LICKING COUNTY, OHIO AREA

March 14, 1968, between 7:04 and 7:05 p.m., I observed a UFO. I had just finished supper and had gotten up from the table and had walked to the kitchen window. I looked out the window to the southeast and observed a slowly moving, small, dull reddish-white object or glow. At first I thought it might be Echo Satellite tracking the rays of the sun through the twilight atmosphere. But as I watched the object, it seemed to move with varying speed from east to west. I called my parents, and my dad rushed to get his binoculars. I went quickly to his side door, then rushed to get my camera, and then I went outside in the 20° (degrees) weather. Meanwhile, the object or glow had been growing bright white and much larger. At the time when I took its picture, it was about at its maximum size and appeared four to five times the size that a bright star appears to a human. Yet, the object was at an angle of inclination of three to five degrees. After noting the quickness of the night, I rushed back inside, and as my parents and I were intently watching this object from our dining room picture window, the object or glow was now brilliant white, began moving westward with a greater velocity. A grove of trees came between it and us, but I was able to follow it and see it grow smaller and change from its intense white to its dull reddish-white glow. I saw it pass between the WCLR Radio Station tower and us, so I guessed the object was approximately two miles distant, being above the valley through which the Licking River flows. When it emerged from behind its grove, it was the same color as that when I had first observed it, and it was growing fainter all the time. The reddish color appeared to flash irregularly until, even through the binoculars, it disappeared.

I have since concluded, after retracing its path in daylight, that the flashing was caused by telephone and electric wires passing behind our house, for at the time the flashing occurred, the glow was so small and faint that it could have easily been blocked from view by the wires. Since the wires are not equally spaced, due to leads to and from the neighboring houses, this accounts for the irregular flashings.

I told no one except one of my physics laboratory partners, hoping I could find more information about possible types of aircraft this might have been to prevent reporting such an object as a UFO if it were aircraft. However, we concluded that it could be no conventional aircraft because of the following reasons:

(1) There was no sound whatever. Jets can be heard for about five miles; propeller-driven airplanes can be heard for three or more miles easy; likewise for helicopters.

(2) There was no green light. Most aircraft have a green light on one wing tip. Also, there were no flashing lights which, so far as I know, all aircraft have.

(3) The bright light could not have been a plane's landing lights because the object was moving east to west of us as we were looking southward, and landing lights shine forward of the plane, and also, there is no airport for several miles out of our home.

(4) The object or glow changed colors and intensity and had no definite shape or form, just as a lighted lightbulb filament has no definite form. Just radiating brightness.

Also, this could not have been a meteor or meteorite or falling debris because of its much slower speed in relation to the speed of a meteor, meteoric, or falling debris and because of its much greater size than any of these, and also due to the fact that the glow maintained a con-

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

[Handwritten text in the drawing area]:
when it first appeared - small, round, dull white glow
soon afterward - intense white and much larger (glowing)
as it disappeared - same as when it first appeared.

[Typed text below the drawing]:
This is actually hard to draw since there were no boundary lines or edges. It was like looking at a ten oversized star or spotlight in the sky.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

[Handwritten text]:
Probably about one half of the object would have been covered by a wooden match head. In other words, from wooden match head held lengthwise, it would probably covered the object in just.
