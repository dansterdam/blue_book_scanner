Cutchogue, N.Y. 11920
April 23, 1966

Dear Sir:

I am writing to you the facts of an object that my daughter and I seen truly in the sky on the evening of April 22-1966.

At approx. 7:07 P.M. EST. traveling North on Vine Road in Cutchogue, N.Y.

We observed a bright/bluish object approx. 2 or 3 miles in dia. traveling horizontally from East to West in the sky for about 3 seconds. at a speed that I have never seen before, and then it was not able to see it any longer due to the dark clouds that got in the way of it.

I do not believe that I was a plane due to the light that is not a plain traveling from East & West would be a Red visible light and not a flash light.

My daughter Nora and Josephine age 15 yrs. met me to notify the Police. Dept. I did not because I felt it was best & see what was in the papers the next morning.

Mrs.
Katrina Falls Rd.
Rock Hill, N. Y. 12775

Dear Sirs,

I read in today's newspaper of some people having contacted you after seeing the bright object in the sky on Friday night. I, too, saw it, and thought I should notify you, in case the government wants information of these sightings for their records or investigation.

I was taking wash off the clothesline around 7:10 Friday night, when I saw a large bright light with a kind of "tail" traveling low in the North West sky. It was visible only a few seconds before being hidden behind the treetops. It reminded me of a falling star, but seemed much larger than the stars appear. The brightness reminded me of the white "sparklers" the children light and hold on the 4th of July, and it seemed to have flickers or sparks coming from it, such as these "sparklers" do.

I told my husband about it, and he teased me about "flying saucers", and then we did not give it more thought, till I saw the article in the Record. I felt it best to notify you for any records you keep on such happenings.

Sincerely
Mrs.
