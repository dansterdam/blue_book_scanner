Dear Jean,

Some writing appears to be on the page, but parts of it are illegible or partially obscured. The text is handwritten and appears to be a letter or note. A portion of the text is clearly visible, but the full content cannot be definitively determined due to the image quality and black redaction marks at the bottom of the page.

The date "2 Apr" is visible in the top right corner of the document.

Most of the text on this page is illegible. There appears to be some faint text or markings on the right side of the page, but the quality of the scan makes it impossible to read with certainty. The page is mostly white/gray with a vertical dashed line down the center and some very faint markings.
