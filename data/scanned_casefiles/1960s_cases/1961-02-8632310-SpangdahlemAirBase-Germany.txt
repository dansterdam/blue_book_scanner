PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 3 Feb 61

2. LOCATION: Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 1803, GMT 07/1703Z

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS: No

6. SOURCE: Military

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 8-12 Seconds

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

9. COURSE: SW-NE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Round, almost pure white object, size of baseball held at arm's length. Appearance of large bright star, only such close. In total, trail, or exhaust observed. No sound heard. Estimated 35° angle approaching observation lower on estimated 055° heading at unknown elevation. Object disappeared to object overtaking the Earth.

11. COMMENTS: Object was moving to NE, or in a direction overtaking the Earth as it rotated. Speed of object rules out possibility that object was a satellite, therefore, object was probably a meteor, and duration of sighting was probably due to object overtaking the Earth.

12. CONCLUSIONS: Probably Astronomical Meteor
