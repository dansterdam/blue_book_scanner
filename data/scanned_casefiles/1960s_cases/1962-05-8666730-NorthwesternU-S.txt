PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 26 may 1962
2. LOCATION: Elgin, Ont., Canada
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local
4. DURATION: 5 min.
5. PHOTOS: 0
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: O Ground-Radar
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 min.
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 3 sourse
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Blinking bright green and white streaked lights moving erratic in all directions, appearing and disappearing. Lights at times seemed to be in a line and at other times in a cluster, and at times would form into one light and then separate. Lights were very much larger and brighter than stars.
11. COMMENTS: This description gives no indication that this was anything more than a normal aircraft. The blinking, erratic movement, and variable grouping of the lights are all characteristic of aircraft lights as seen from a distance. There is no evidence to indicate that this was an unidentified object. There is no indication of any physical observable details that could suggest this was any kind of special or unusual aerial phenomenon. The report itself is not one that provides any substantial evidence to warrant further investigation as an unidentified flying object.

Lt God Friend
UDC: 
Here is an article out of the "Today Magazine" that is a poster. On May 23 th a firelike multicolored fireball streaked over Vancouver British Columbia. It was thought to be a meteor, but some questioned whether it was. It was not a meteor. 

The object passed overhead at about 400 ft. But didn't make a sound. Vancouver sUl reported that it broke up the "MOUNTED" at one time. Granney (?) their necks to see the object. An EXCITED POLICE heard it and saw it. BLUE AND GOLD AND SILVER. AT POLICE STATIONS NEWSPAPERS OFFICES RADIO STATIONS and WITH excited queries.

How lets see the Holy Bible 5 verses 1 From the Whatver a.f.b.

OBSERVERS: DR. GERARD KUIPER, MR. A.L. HILTNER
OBJECT: UNKNOWN CELESTIAL PHENOMENON 
REPORT: AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 A.M. MST, DR. KUIPER AND MR. HILTNER OBSERVED A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE SKY. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WAS MOVING IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 10 TO 15 DEGREES PER MINUTE. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HORIZON. DURING THE OBSERVATION, THE OBJECT MAINTAINED A STEADY BRIGHTNESS AND DID NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE SIZE OR COLOR. NO TRAIL OR OTHER FEATURES WERE NOTED.
EVALUATION: THE OBSERVERS ARE EXPERIENCED ASTRONOMERS AND THE REPORT APPEARS TO BE FACTUAL AND ACCURATE. THE OBJECT DOES NOT FIT THE DESCRIPTION OF ANY KNOWN CELESTIAL BODY OR MAN-MADE OBJECT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.

Marion Fanzke
Racine, Wisconsin
May 26, 1962

Dear Sir:

I have just read in the local paper about another unidentified object seen in our area. I am writing to tell you about something that happened to my husband and I on May 11, 1962.

We were driving home from Milwaukee about 10:30 p.m. on that date. As we approached the [illegible] area, my husband suddenly said, "Look at that!" I looked up and saw a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be hovering over the highway, then suddenly shot straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.

We both watched it intently, and it was definitely not an airplane, meteor, or anything like that. It was a bright, white, round object that seemed to glow. It was not blinking or flashing as airplanes do. The speed at which it shot straight up was unbelievable.

I am writing to you in the hope that you will find this information of interest and that it may add to your files on unexplained aerial phenomena. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely yours,
Marion Fanzke

"1530 May 4 1962
Captain Donald E. Keyhoe 
Glassboro, N.J.
Washington

Dear Captain Keyhoe,

My wife and I got along very well with reports from other sources of what we saw, light at the upper right corner of the sky disappearing rapidly. It seems hard to translate for more from dark to cloudly and on to disappearance in three to four seconds but that was the sequence as we observed it. We were 
faced with almost an impossible chance of determining exact measurements because everything had to be done instantan1eously. I received a sightingly high at 10:14 P.M. local time on April 25, 1962. The object came from the north, moved slowly at first, increased speed and then disappeared in the direction it had appeared. I would appreciate you comment on this report. Thank you.

Harlen AFB."
