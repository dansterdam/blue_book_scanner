Here is an article out of the Wake Magazine/
Was it a Meteor.

On may 28 th a Huge multicolored fireball streaked through the sky over Vancouver British Columbia. It was thought to be a huge Meteor. But some questioned whether it was. It was not a meteor claimed U.S. Customs Official John Linn. It had all the appearances of being covered. It passed overhead at about 400 Ft. But didn't make a sound. The Vancouver SUN reported that it broke up the MOUNTAIN* PORTLAND Baseball Game at Capilano Stadium for about three minutes as fans and players scurried for shelter .... DOWNTOWN TRAFFIC SLOWED TO A CRAWL AS MOTORIST Cranned their necks to see the object. AN EXCITED POLICEMAN RADIOED headquarters that an airliner was burning in the sky Witnesses said it was BLUE RED GOLD AND ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW. THEY JAMMED SWITCHBOARDS AT POLICE STATIONS NEWSPAPERS OFFICES RADIO STATIONS AND MILITARY.

With excited queries.

The image appears to be a scanned document page, but most of the text is very faint and difficult to read. I can partially make out a few lines of text at the top left of the page, but the text is mostly illegible. There is a black redaction/censorship mark in the middle of the document. The page appears to be from an official document, possibly a government or military report, but the specific details cannot be confidently determined due to the poor image quality.


- page 4 -

Most of the text on this page is too blurry or faint to be reliably read. There are some vertical handwritten notes on the left side of the page that appear to read "T-63/64" and "Northwestern July", but the rest of the text is not clearly legible. At the bottom right of the page, there is some text that is also too faint to confidently transcribe.


- page 5 -

The text at the top of the page reads "Meteor Panics" and "Roswell Crowd", but the rest of the text is too blurry and illegible to accurately transcribe. The page appears to be a document with dense text, but the image quality makes most of the text unreadable.

On 28 May, reports from some commercial pilots and one jet pilot along with reports from other sources of having seen a "very bright burning white light with green fire bolts coming out of rear going in direction from North to Southeast. Speed reported as extremely high to 700 MPH. Local papers count to know what object is. Reports came from Canada all the way to Oregon. Think perhaps it was a shooting star. No miss. Location 100 miles east of Mullen Pass, and heading W of Larsen AFB.
