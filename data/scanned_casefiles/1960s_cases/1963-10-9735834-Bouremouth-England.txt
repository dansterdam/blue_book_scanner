The image contains a diagram with two parts. The first part is a graph with angles and elevations labeled, and the second part is a compass-like illustration. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an X on the horizon where you first saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (height) when you first saw it. Place a "V" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Reference is made to the sighting you observed on 12/29/63. Your report was investigated and evaluated by the United States Air Force.

It is believed that the object you observed was a reflection of some of aircraft that was illuminated and evaluated by the United States Air Force.

Thank you for submitting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

UFO SIGHTING (BOURNEMOUTH, ENGLAND)
1. MRS USAT 3-401-P3 (Mrs Golaris) 
On 22 December 63, Mrs Golaris of 75, Shermanston Avenue, Bournemouth, Hants, England, saw an unidentified object in the sky.

2. At about 1800 to 1810 hours (GMT), the observer observed an object described as brighter than the stars. The object gave a report of about 250 deg azimuth; this is the direction from a compass point where the object was seen. The object was to the right or north as the observer faced the object. 

3. Antares, a first magnitude star (Mv 1.1) was on the horizon at 205 deg azimuth at the time of the sighting. Also, Mars with a magnitude of +1.7 was at 15 deg SW with a dec-clination of -21.8 deg. Between 1800 to 1810 hours on 10 Oct the Moon was at 23 deg (Mv -12.6). Therefore, the declination of the object, if it was celestial, could not contribute to this sighting.

4. The observer indicated that a dark red sky was to the right or north of the object. The reddish color is suggestive of the object being closest to the horizon while the observer faced it. 

5. To the sighting or reflection of Mars or Antares, analysis tends to indicate that this is more closely associated with her report.

FOR THE COMMANDER:

The image appears to be a handwritten document or report, but it does not contain any photographs. The image shows densely written text across the entire page, with no visible images or photographs.

Extracting the text as an OCR system:

Bournemouth, England
The clear sky suddenly appeared to the observer at 10.17 p.m. Local Time on 9th October 1963 with a white light of dazzling brightness travelling in a northerly direction at high speed. The light was observed for about 5 seconds before disappearing from view. No sound was heard. The observer was standing in Bournemouth, Dorset, England at the time of the observation.

- page 9 -

The image provided does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a handwritten document or notes. The image consists mainly of text, which I will proceed to transcribe below.

The text reads:

"Unidentified aerial phenomena observed at Bournemouth, England, on October 9, 1963.

At approximately 10:15 p.m., several individuals observed a bright, stationary object in the sky over Bournemouth. The object was described as oval or disc-shaped, with a luminous glow. It remained in the same position for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

The report states that the object was observed by multiple reliable witnesses, and that no conventional aircraft were known to be in the area at the time. The case was investigated by the British Ministry of Defense as part of Project Blue Book, but no satisfactory explanation could be determined."

December 4, 1963

Dear Mrs L.J.G.

I thank you for your letter of November 7, 1963 in which you appear to state an "unidentified aerial phenomena" which you observed on September 21, 1963.

I regret that your letter intended in making an official report on this sighting, which was unidentified, to the Project Blue Book office has not been answered. I was unaware of the report and would have been glad to reply to your many questions. 

The information would have been greatly appreciated and would have provided details which could have been integrated into the analysis of this case. I am sure that you would kindly answer any additional questions I might ask, and provide you with the results of our evaluation.

This report appears to be similar to many others we have collected, which relate to aspects of sightings of unusual objects in the sky. As you know, we endeavor to investigate and analyze such reports scientifically in order to determine, if possible, the nature and causes of the phenomena. Your further cooperation in providing details of your observation would be most helpful.

Dr. Allen, who heads the Project Blue Book office, would be pleased to furnish you with copies of available technical reports if you are interested. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Sincerely,

Major Hector Quintanilla
Assistant Chief, USAF
Office of Information
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
