Dear Mrs. [redacted]

Reference is made to the sighting you observed on October 13, 1963, which was investigated and evaluated by the United States Air Force.

It is believed that the object you observed was the setting or rotation of Mars or Antares. Analysis tends to indicate Antares because of greater brightness and color more closely associated with your report.

Thank you for submitting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Bournemouth, England)

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-PB (Mrs Geiser)
Wash 25 D C

On 19 Oct 63, Mrs [redacted] Sherman Avenue, Southbourne, Bournemouth, Hants, England, saw an unidentified flying object and has requested an evaluation of her sighting. Pertinent facts regarding her observation are as follows:

a. At about 1800 to 1810 hours Mrs [redacted] observed an object described as bronze or gold in color. The direction given in her report was about 250 deg azimuth. This is the direction of the sun. The sun set at 1701 and the end of astronomical twilight was 1847 hours. In the narrative of her report she indicated that a dark red sky was to the right of the object. Therefore, it is believed that the object was to the left of the reported position.

b. Antares, a first magnitude star (+1.3), was on the horizon at 225 deg azimuth at the reported time of the sighting. Also, Mars with a magnitude of +1.7 was at 15 deg with a declination of -19.23 deg. This places the planet on the horizon at 231 deg azimuth. Mars tends to appear reddish in color. At 1800 hours on 19 Oct the Moon was at 235 deg (15 14.16.205) however, the declination of -13 1/2 was astronomical body below the Sun. Therefore, it could not contribute to the cause of this sighting.

c. In this case, Mrs [redacted] observation is believed to be the setting or refraction of Mars or Antares. Analysis tends to indicate Antares because of greater brightness and a color more closely associated with her report.

December 4, 1963

Dear Mrs.

Thank you for your letter of November 7, 1963, in which you reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object on October 19th.

Since we are interested in making an evaluation of this sighting, we are inclosing an official form, TP-164, entitled "U.S. Air Force Technical Information." If you would kindly answer as many of the questions therein as you can recall and forward the form to this headquarters, we will attempt to evaluate the sighting and advise you of the results.

The United States Air Force does not endorse any books written on the subject of "Flying Saucers" with the exception of "The World of Flying Saucers" by Gillmor, Observatory and has worked closely with the Air Force for many years on the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena. The books of are not an authority. However, there is no evidence whatsoever which indicates that unidentified flying objects could possibly be space vehicles from another plane.

We are inclosing a brochure on the subject of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena which we think will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,
MASTON M. JACKS
