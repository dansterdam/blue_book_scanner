UNIDENTIFIED DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

10. CONCLUSION:
1. Astro (WFTRE)
2. Other (UNFILMED)
Object with tall probably meteor, other lights probably reflection on the cloud as indicated in the report

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object were reported as round, some with tail, clear sky red. Some conventional explanation. All reports give object as point, no event had tail. Larger and longer than object, in some long reports. All reports had object between 40-70 line elevation. Two reports of red disappear of straight up. Reports averaged 15 minutes. Most of objects were stationary. Observed stationary, the clouds were reflecting city lights, etc. Source of this information is unknown. Data incomplete on each report since all info submitted as one basic report instead of individual sightings. Evaluation from present is likely negativity.

Sighting of 4 September 1965, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania:

I talked with Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] two of the nine independent witnesses. Both witnesses gave consistent stories, but the evidence of neither of them rule out the strong possibility that the cause of the sighting was reflection of blast furnaces on high thin clouds containing ice crystals. In fact, local interest of news reports reportedly stated that such an ice crystal cloud reflecting city lights had been detected.
