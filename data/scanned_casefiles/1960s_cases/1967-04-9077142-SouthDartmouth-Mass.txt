Here is the OCR text from the document:

LC Freeman/SAFOICC/L)s/7907/9/6 July 61

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Based upon your remarks that the object was approximately 75 feet way and that a pole 75 feet in height was 50 feet at the object, the following dimensions were arrived at by using a nominal 127 mm focal length lens: basic diameter, 4.5 feet; base width or thickness, 0.7 feet; focal diameter, 2.0 feet.

Although we are unable to positively identify the object, the photographic analysis does not support your remarks concerning the size of the object. It appears that the object was actually closer to the camera than 75 feet. Thus making the object even smaller.

Enclosed are your original photograph with one enlarged copy.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

SUBJECT UFO. NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS OF A LIGHTER OBJECT TOOK PLACE OVER THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST PARTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY BETWEEN 0233Z AND 0252Z, 27 APRIL AND BETWEEN 0333Z AND 0345Z, 27 APRIL. DESCRIPTIONS OF SHAPE, COLOR OF LIGHTS, AND COURSE OF OBJECT VARIED. LOCAL RADIO STATIONS RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS ABOUT UFOS AND SEVERAL CALLS WERE MADE TO TINKER AFB. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS AN ILLUMINATED ADVERTISING SIGN BEING TOWED BEHIND A LIGHT AIRPLANE. DURING CONVERSATION WITH THE PILOT AFTER LANDING, HE STATED HE AND HIS PARTNER WERE

TESTING TO DETERMINE THE BEST ALTITUDE AND AIRSPEED AT WHICH THEY SHOULD FLY SO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND COULD READ THE SIGN. TWO FLIGHTS WERE MADE DURING THE TIME OF THE REPORTED SIGHTINGS. THE PILOT STATED THAT IF AN OBSERVER WERE NOT IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT POSITION TO READ THE SIGN, IT APPEARED AS A RATHER WEIRD SIGHT. SINCE THE OBJECT WAS CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED AND TWO RADIO STATIONS HAD INQUIRED AT TINKER AFB, THE LOCAL OFFICER OF INFORMATION WAS CONTACTED, INFORMED OF THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND REQUESTED TO RELEASE INFORMATION TO THE LOCAL NEWS MEDIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH AFR 80-17. THIS INFORMATION WAS RELEASED PRIOR TO 0403Z, 27 APRIL. THE PILOT WAS ASKED TO CONTACT THE TINKER AFB UFO PROJECT OFFICER BEFORE ANY FUTURE FLIGHTS SO WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY CALLS DURING THE TIME.

1. PURPOSE: This report serves to answer Work Order Number 67-63 in which Major Quintanilla requested an analysis be made of subject photography to determine the identification of the object in question.

2. ANALYSIS: Upon examination it was found that certain physical characteristics prevailed insofar as the subject was concerned. The object in question had a cylindrical, disc-like shape with a somewhat bent described as hemispherical in shape. Rising above and encir-cling the base was a railing-like component with several vertical members which served to support the railing. While the base of the object was metallic in color, the hemispherical center was colored green exhibited some quality of a translucent quality.

3. Based upon source's remarks that the object was approximately 75 feet away and that 50 feet at the object was a pole 7.5 feet in height, the following dimensions were arrived at: by using a nominal 127mm focal length lens; base diameter, 4.5 feet; height or thickness, 2 feet; railing height, .33 feet; superstructure height 1.2 feet and superstructure diameter, 2 feet.

4. Other than a dimensional analysis, no function or purpose could be determined for the object.
