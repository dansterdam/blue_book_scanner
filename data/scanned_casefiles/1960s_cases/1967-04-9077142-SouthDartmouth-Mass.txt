The text in the document is as follows:

LG Freeman/SAPXRCC/1/9/75079/6 July 61

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Attached herewith is your original photograph for our records. This object was approximately 75 feet away and was 3-4 feet in diameter. The photograph indicates its brightness, size, and lack of details or thickness as noted by your observations.

Photographic analysis shows no support for our remarks concerning the size, shape, and appearance of the object. This indicates it was probably a real physical object and not merely a reflection or mirage.

Enclosed are your original photograph with one enlarged copy.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. Your diligence in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

35. Is there any additional information you can supply, including any special experience, which might be pertinent?

I believe I may have observed a satellite reentry object or small meteorite. It seemed to move rapidly across the sky, was bright reddish-orange in color, and left no trail. It was observed only for a few seconds. My first thought was that it was a flare or meteor, but it was more brilliant and did not seem to be dropping. I have always been interested in astronomy and have observed meteors and satellites many times. This seemed different from anything I have seen before.

My knowledge of astronomy is limited, and I am completely uncertain of exactly what I saw. I do hope that this information may be of some interest to you.

Sincerely yours,

It did look like a egg, and it moved around without any noise. It appeared to stop, hover, then move away. We were both watching it intensely, and it did not come any closer than described. The color was kind of a grey, and seemed to have a high polish or shine to it, almost metallic. We were both quite excited about it, and only wish we could have observed it longer, but it soon disappeared from our view. I hope this description is what you wanted.

11-9-57 - I noticed while standing in the backyard of my home at about 10:30 p.m. that there were several unidentified bright lights or objects in the sky moving rapidly in various directions. They appeared to change in color from white to red. The objects seemed to be very high in the sky but much closer than the stars. I watched them for several minutes as they zipped through the sky, sometimes appearing to change direction suddenly. They seemed to be larger than stars and not blinking as aircraft lights do. I have no idea what they were but they were strange and different from anything I have ever seen in the sky before.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a report documenting a UFO sighting incident that took place over Oklahoma City between April 26 and April 27, 1967. The report describes numerous sightings of a lighter object in the sky, with local radio stations receiving numerous calls about the incident. The report details that the object sighted was an illuminated advertising sign, and that the pilot of the object stated he and his partner were in conversation with the pilot after landing. The report also mentions that tests were conducted to determine the best altitude and airspeed at which the object should fly so people on the ground could read the sign. The report was released to the local news media in accordance with AFR 80-17.

SUBJECT UFO. NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS OF A LIGHTER OBJECT TOOK PLACE OVER THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST PARTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY BETWEEN 2232Z AND 2339Z, 27 APRIL AND 0342Z AND 0355Z, 27 APRIL. DESCRIPTIONS OF SHAPE, COLOR OF LIGHTS, AND COURSE OF OBJECT VARIED. LOCAL RADIO STATIONS RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS ABOUT UFOS AND SEVERAL CALLS WERE MADE TO TINKER AFB. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS AN ILLUMINATED ADVERTISING SIGN BEING TOWED BEHIND A LIGHT AIRPLANE; DURING CONVERSATION WITH THE PILOT AFTER LANDING, HE STATED HE AND HIS PARTNER WERE TESTING TO DETERMINE THE BEST ALTITUDE AND AIRSPEED AT WHICH THEY SHOULD FLY SO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND COULD READ THE SIGN. TWO FLIGHTS WERE MADE DURING THE TIME OF THE REPORTED SIGHTINGS. THE PILOT STATED THAT IF AN OBSERVER WERE NOT IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT POSITION TO READ THE SIGN, IT APPEARED AS A RATHER WEIRD SIGHT. SINCE THE OBJECT WAS CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED AND TWO RADIO STATIONS HAD INQUIRED AT TINKER AFB, THE LOCAL OFFICER OF INFORMATION WAS CONTACTED, INFORMED OF THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND REQUESTED TO RELEASE INFORMATION TO THE LOCAL NEWS MEDIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH AFR 80-17. THIS INFORMATION WAS RELEASED PRIOR TO 2432Z, 27 APRIL. THE PILOT WAS ASKED TO CONTACT THE TINKER AFB UFO PROJECT OFFICER BEFORE ANY FUTURE FLIGHTS SO WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY CALLS DURING THE TIME.

[Handwritten text]: On the night of April 18,1967, at approximately 10:30 p.m., I was looking out of the window of my home in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, when I noticed a bright light in the sky. It was very bright and seemed to be hovering. As I watched, it moved slowly to the right, then stopped and hovered again. After a short time, it moved slowly to the left and then down. It disappeared from view behind some trees. The light was so bright it seemed to illuminate the trees and houses in the area. I have never seen anything like this before.

ATTN OF: 1-21  

SUBJECT: UFO Photograph

TO: DEPUTY COMMANDER, Ohio ACOORD, Ohio 44330

1. Reference is made to your letter, 1-20-67, subject photograph, which was forwarded to this headquarters.

2. The photograph does not show anything conclusive about the nature of the object. It does not contain sufficient detail to permit reliable interpretation or photographic analysis. The edges of the object appear blurred which would indicate that the object was moving during the exposure.

3. Ground observers should be instructed to attempt to estimate the size, distance, and direction of flight of unidentified objects, and to obtain more than one picture, if possible, in order to provide a sequence of exposures. Also, the exact time and location of the sighting should be recorded.

4. Lighting, from camera to object, as measured on the light meter, should be recorded, as well as camera settings used (aperture and shutter speed). This information may be helpful in interpreting the photographs.

5. The incident does not appear to warrant further investigation at this time. Please forward any additional information or sightings to this office.

6. I have reviewed the available information, and a sketch of the photograph is attached.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It is a photo analysis report for an "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" observed in Dartmouth, Massachusetts on 30 April 1967. The report describes the physical characteristics of the observed object, including its cylindrical, disc-like shape, grayish-white color, and emitting a vapor trail. The report also provides the dimensions of the object and mentions that no function or purpose could be determined for it.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-18
DATE OF REPORT 6 June 1967
