MANY LANDINGS IN MEXICO: A news report from early September states several recent landings in various parts of Mexico. Some are of the "saucer" variety; and therefore found a bit suspicious to us. Others, in our opinion, involve more "orthodox" landings including the National Polytechnic Institute itself. Pictures of rocks apparently scorched by the landings were prominently displayed in local newspapers. And, in a remote province (unnamed in the article), a number of these have landed and to have been captured by the Mexican Army, though no details. In another case, residents of the Texoco area on the Mexico City scene say a saucer land on a local lake and sink below the surface. A newspaper reporter was assigned to spend a day on the lake looking, but he found nothing.

As for the "contactee" stories, they involve at least two dentist - one group from Mexico City's University, and the other age - who claim they were taken for rides in flying saucers. Students were allegedly taken to the third moon of Jupiter in a good-looking seven-foot-tall giants, who were clad in one-piece suit of some sort of stretch fabric. The giants neither talked nor operated any controls, but apparently did everything by telepathic students reported finding a family from Brazil already living there for at least several months ago. The family had been there several months ago. The family had been taken there, all of whom are blue-eyed blonds similar in appearance to Norse origin.

Here is a statement of what I saw: Seen some things last night.  they began around 12:20 p.m. A little round thing. It shot up, stopped, and then shot down again. Did this a few times. So bright you couldn't look at. Sometimes it came low over the trees. Then it would go high up and disappear. This went on for about an hour. There were several of them over this period. I called my wife and my brother-in-law to see it but it had quit by the time they got outside. They didn't see anything. I know I saw something strange and I wish I could have shown it to someone else. I don't know what they were. I'm telling you just what I saw. I really don't like to even talk about it, but I felt I should report it. I'm not the type to see things. But I know I saw something that wasn't an airplane or anything like that. I'm not easily excited, but I was shook up over this. It was so bright and fast, and just didn't seem normal.

INCIDENT: 1965-09-08 TACOMA, WASHINGTON

MAN OBSERVES UFO WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY NORTH OF TACOMA, WASHINGTON

SUMMARY: On 1965-09-08, at approximately 2050 hours, a male witness was driving north on Highway 5, approximately 10 miles north of Tacoma, Washington, when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light was stationary at first, then moved rapidly across the sky from west to east, and finally hovered in the eastern sky. The witness stopped his automobile to observe the object, which appeared to be circular in shape and was illuminated with a bright pulsating light. The object remained in view for about 10 minutes, then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The witness was unable to determine the size, altitude, or speed of the object. No physical traces were found at the site.

was a to see the and other lighted objects in the sky over our house last night. At about 10:30 p.m. I observed four bright lights in the sky from my front porch. They appeared to be about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon in the West or Northwest and were moving very slowly in a southerly direction. They seemed to be at a great altitude and were approximately the same size as an aircraft, but were much brighter than any aircraft lights I have ever seen. There was no sound associated with these objects. They were visible for about 10 minutes until they disappeared behind some trees. I have notified other people who may have seen the objects, but so far have been unable to confirm any other sightings. I would appreciate your investigating this incident and advising me of your findings.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing what seems to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object in the sky. The object is a dark, elliptical shape against a plain background. There are no other identifiable elements in the image.

"This is a report based on the statements of Mrs [redacted], who claims to have seen an unidentified flying object over Tacoma, Washington on September 8, 1965. According to the report, Mrs [redacted] saw a dark, saucer-shaped object in the sky that appeared to be hovering and then moved away rapidly. She stated that the object was silent and did not make any sound. The report indicates that Mrs [redacted] was frightened by the sighting and that she called the authorities to report it. The report also notes that several other people in the area also reported seeing the same object at the same time."

Low-flying space capsule?

A witness object swooping over 
Waikiki Beach, and inspecting houses in
Honolulu, was tracked by an HZNZAF
navigator Marine West on September 17,1957. The capsule was described
as about the size of a large car, and was
seen to rise out of the sea and climb out
of sight over Upolu, gliding and silent.
"And Mr. Wescott, I would
guess it was a between 1,500 and
6,000 feet in altitude."
The object changed direction at
times, and at one stage changed from a grey to a silvery
metallic colour as the sun shone on it.
It was like a small silver
capsule, Mr. Wescott added.
What detailed cosmic data it
could have gathered remains a mystery, but its very existence is undeniable. (Credit: Ronald Casell, Harlow)

Dim Those Lights, 
You Look Like UFO

TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 3—Reports 
of people in the Tacoma area mistaking
bright exterior lights for UFO's have prompted 
the Tacoma Manufadturing Co. of Tacoma, Wash. to suggest:

"Dim Those Lights, You Look Like UFO".

The company said its anti-ceilition lights, meant to warn air traffic, are being mistaken for UFO's. A company spokesman said the lights, 
which are being installed on a 200-foot chimney
will be dimmed if the mistake continues.
The spokesman said he didn't want to add to the UFO mystery.

East Maidstone Phenomenon

The 'Sunday Mirror' of September 5 1965 tells of a luminous object which was seen by several people in the East Maidstone district shortly before 10 p.m. on September 2. The item continues:- "It was an orange, lighted object and appeared to be stationary. It was about the size of a very large star and seemed to vanish gradually, dimming and disappearing after about a minute. It surprised local people and was apparently witnessed altogether."

Transcription of the text in the document:

Officials at the airport control tower had only seen a "very pretty light about the size of a star" high in the sky. They said the object was stationary and that they had not called the military, since the object had caused no disturbance.

Calls to the star revealed it was the satellite Vanguard. Officials said that it was orbiting as forecasted.

While lines of cars lengthened to a halt on the main road, crowds of pedestrians staring upward screened to a halt and glanced out toward a luminous object.

"It seemed to be growing larger and larger," one witness said.

Another described the object as changing in size and shape—now appearing round, now oval, even triangular at times—and finally moving upward at a "terrific rate of speed" toward the west.

One driver said the object appeared to be just hovering and was brilliantly lit. "It seemed to be hovering and then going down toward the trees and back up again," he said.

Some reported seeing two or three objects, while others saw only one. Several described the objects as "disc-shaped" or "saucer-shaped," and several said the objects emitted a brilliant white light.

Police Lt. Klinck said that when the object was first sighted just before dawn, it appeared to be stationary, but then it began moving and seemed to go up and down and back and forth. He said the object was so bright that it was difficult to look at it.

Two witnesses said the object appeared to "go down behind a tree, then come up again."

The satellites, officials said, are orbiting as scheduled and expected. They said this explained the sightings, which were described as "typical satellite or meteor sightings."

There isn't any news from this end of the saucer world. Houston papers do anything with my letter? Hope they did. I told them about it and I will be interested to know what they did about it. Did they ever get the books yet for me?

Dear Mom and Dad,

Let me start off by saying that the UFOs (the flying saucers) are still here in Ground at about every night. This has been causing a lot of discussion and talk about over radio City and people are telling to look up in the sky and there is those unidentified flying objects going through the sky and some people are asking to call this a natural phenomenon. It has seem that this now down to all natural phenomenon. And also would like to know that these UFOs are more than just a natural phenomenon as they are becoming more numerous to be considered a collection of individual signals that something unusual is going on. I could just sat the real truth of which is honestly believe that everyone should know about it. 

You say that it is a a natural phenomenon? That maybe. Bow I believe that these apparitions and apparitions don't tell and never will. Maybe you are right, who am I to say other. But I myself have the feeling that this is more than a natural phenoonenon. From the facts I have been getting out, it is my honest opinion that there is something very unusual going on. I am unable to prove it through scientific examination which some think can be done. I know of no one that has been able to disapprove it either. And that is about this time we can only wait and see what develops.

Just now we come across seeding from the sky. The Navy too has seen this and report on it. It's on page 15-22.

So far there has been nothing to prove that there are flying discs (or saucers) as many people call them.
I hope Mom, I have been receiving your letters in Mexico. I appreciate everything.

Dear Mom and Dad,

I hope this letter finds you both well. The reason I'm writing is because I had a strange experience the other night which I would like to tell you about. This may have been partially the result of something I saw here or heard about.

On September 25, 1965, around 10:00 p.m., I was out in my back yard and I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I thought it might have been a satellite or an airplane, but as I watched it, I saw that it was definitely not either of these. The object was round and had flashing lights on it, like the kind you see on airport control towers. At times it appeared to be standing still, and then it would suddenly dart off at a tremendous rate of speed. 

I watched this display for about 45 minutes until it finally disappeared from view. I was really quite shaken by the experience and wondered what in the world I had seen. When I came back in the house, I turned on the TV and saw that there had been a news report about some similar sightings in the local area. Apparently, a number of people had called the police to report seeing strange objects in the sky.

I don't know what to make of all this. I suppose it could have been some kind of experimental aircraft, but the way it moved was very unlike anything I've ever seen before. I'll be sure to let you know if I happen to see anything else unusual. In the meantime, I'd be very interested to hear if you've ever had any experiences like this.

Love,
Your son

Flying Saucer Report
Flying Across Mexico

The newspapers SAID: A mysterious aerial object described by eye-witnesses as "flying saucer" or "flying torpedo" was sighted over Mexico on August 24. It was seen flying at great height from the Pacific Coast to the Gulf of Mexico. The object was reported to have flown over Chihuahua, Monterrey, Tampico and the Yucatan Peninsula.

Army and air force officials said they were unable to identify the object although it was observed for hours by many people. It moved at tremendous speed and changed directions sharply.

Another group reported seeing a similar object over the Pacific some days later. Theories as to its identity included rocket-powered aircraft, a satellite or a meteorite.

outside during the three hours everything was happening and we both saw a very sudden change in the temperature after the first sightings.
Good, it does seem quite unhill. A matter of seconds it was cold. The weather may not have been affected by the object but I should mention it just in case.
I cannot be a judge just what to say since I was an eye witness. I wish I would remember more of the details. If I do this thing else I will let you know. Meanwhile, I still suggest that you continue with your investigation. Don't know what good it will do that I don't even know me, but I will personally vouch for the honesty and reliable witness in the world.
Thank you again, Mr. Hynek. I hope this letter will help.
Sincerely,

Text extracted from the document:

Notice a very bright object lighting up the valley somewhere between our house and the trees, approximately five or six miles away. I looked and had just seen the same object and we stopped to watch it. It had a pale blue hue and seemed to be about the size of a car but looked silvery and different from any planes or anything that I had seen before. It hovered and seemed to be outside the trees. I'm not really sure of the date but I believe the sighting took place on September 8, 1965. It took the object for about thirty seconds to disappear. As soon as it did I decided to call Mrs. [redacted]. It took me a minute or two to find her number and get everyone on the line. When I got the number, the light was still a fairly clear light but by the time everyone was outside, the light had faded to a pale blue and had an odd shape. Everyone seemed to agree that the object was a somewhat different shape, elongated, and described it as a different color or shades of colors, more like a car-like shape. It also seemed to be hovering and was transforming in a way. After a little while the light became less bright and went off. It seemed to be hovering and a transformer in the sky but no noise. A flash light that was located about a block away was directed up towards the object and it seemed to be moving in the sky. I would say the object was visible for about 15-20 minutes and was seen by all eleven people in our house. It didn't leave like an airplane; it seemed to move towards the hospital area in a visible manner about 11:30 p.m. And then again around 1:30 a.m. The second time we saw the object, it was about the same time, but we could not see it for that length of time. We heard the dissipation circular motion towards the end sometime around 2:00 a.m. We decided it wasn't going to happen again so we went to bed. The next morning we read in the newspaper that a Seattle couple had reported seeing a similar object around midnight near the [redacted] area.

Dear Dr. Hynek,
Let me start off by thanking you and my wife Vallie for the dinner on Thursday, November 25. It is really a pleasure to finally be able to discuss this thing personally with someone who is interested and open-minded on the subject instead of just looking at it from the humorous side. To we were definitely exciting, scary and weird -- but humorous -- and I could have laughed at that time if my life had depended on it. The reason we didn't call you right away from Tuesday evening was that we all feel that if people want to learn about these things just let them read one of the books written by Donald Keyhoe. I explained to Vallie that I really feel we will find my uncle in time to be rather intriguing. I will tell you everything I can remember more details. My husband, Mr. was also present and went out in the car to try to get a closer view of the object. Now made a file of the newspaper clippings and pictures printed through him which arrived that day. We had been in Tacoma City that evening and the weather was "rain" with a heavy overcast. The weather was bad in general for much of that night. We had just finished dinner and had some coffee before we went outside and could not determine certainly that anything had flashed in the sky, but did hear a peculiar sound that we both noted. This is all I can give you at the present time but will be in touch with you again soon. Sincerely yours...

The image provided appears to be a photograph from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The photograph shows a single, distinct object in the sky that resembles a typical UFO depiction - a dark, elongated shape against a mostly blank background. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in the image.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

This is a field report from project Blue Book regarding a sighting in Tacoma, Washington on September 8, 1965.

The report states:
On September 8, 1965 at approximately 8:30 PM, a citizen of Tacoma, Washington reported seeing a strange object in the sky. The object was described as dark in color, elongated in shape, and estimated to be about 40-50 feet in length. It was observed for approximately 5 minutes as it moved silently across the sky from west to east at an estimated altitude of 500-1000 feet. No other details about the object or the sighting were provided in this brief summary report.

[BEGIN TEXT OUTPUT]
During the late afternoon of 8 September 1965, at about 1600 hours, a commercial airline pilot flying a Convair 880 jet enroute from Tacoma, Washington to Portland, Oregon reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The pilot stated that the object was sighted approximately 15 miles northeast of Tacoma at an estimated altitude of 35,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was observed for about two minutes before it disappeared from sight.

The pilot's report was received by the Tacoma Radar Approach Control and relayed to the 25th NORAD Region Control Center at McChord Air Force Base, Washington. An investigation was immediately initiated by the 25th NORAD Region.

The pilot was interviewed by NORAD personnel and stated that the object appeared to be rotating or spinning as it moved at a high rate of speed. He also stated that the object seemed to reflect or emit a bright light. No other aircraft were in the immediate vicinity at the time of the sighting. The pilot's report was confirmed by the Tacoma Radar Approach Control.

The 25th NORAD Region investigation revealed that there were no known aircraft, satellites, or other objects in the area that could have been mistaken for the object sighted by the pilot. All available radar and visual sighting information was gathered and evaluated by the NORAD investigators.

After a thorough analysis of the information collected, the 25th NORAD Region concluded that the object sighted by the commercial airline pilot was an unidentified flying object. The incident was forwarded to NORAD Headquarters, Colorado Springs, Colorado, for further evaluation.

SUBJECT:

The object was observed for approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds. It was observed through binoculars by the witness. The object was round in shape, silvered in color, and seemed to be hovering or standing still at an angle. The witness stated that the object appeared to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. The object was observed moving slowly and silently, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The object was observed at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet above the ground. The witness reported no other unusual phenomena observed in the area at the time. The weather at the time of the sighting was clear.

Dear Dr. Hanes,
Ed and I did go to Kramer big yesterday and made a positive identification of the object sighted on September 24. It was apparently a meteor, bright green color, travelling from north to south. Broke up into three parts and completely disappeared. It was visible for about 5 seconds. I consider this to be a positive identification although the details given in the original report are somewhat vague. I hope this information is of some help to you.
Sincerely,
Norman G. Nelson, 9/27/62

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

I was awakened about 12:15 AM 9-8-65 by a bright light coming in the window. At first I thought it was an airplane but as I watched it, I realized it was not an airplane. It was about the size of a DC6 and hovered silently about 1,000 feet up and 500 yards from the house. I watched it for about 10 minutes before it shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The night was very clear and the object was visible the entire time. I did not hear any sound from the object.
