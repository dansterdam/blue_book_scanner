MANY LANDINGS IN MEXICO. A news report from early September tells of several recent landings in various parts of Mexico. Some are of the "contactee" variety, and therefore sound a bit suspicious to us. Others, more credible in our opinion, involve more "orthodox" landing incidents - such as the UFO which allegedly landed near the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City itself. Pictures of rocks supposedly scorched by the saucer's exhaust were prominently displayed in local newspapers.

And, in a Texas province (unnamed in the article), a saucer is said to have landed and to have been captured by the Mexican Army, though the Army denies this. In another case, residents of the Texcoco area on the edge of Mexico City saw a saucer land on a local lake and sink into the mud. A newspaper reporter was assigned to spend a day on the lake looking for the object, but he found nothing.

As for the "contactee" stories, they involve at least two groups of students - one group from Mexico City's university, and the other of high school age - who claim they were taken for rides in flying saucers. The university students were allegedly taken to the third moon of Jupiter. In a saucer manned by good-looking seven-foot-tall giants, who were clad in one-piece suits made out of some sort of stretch fabric. The giants neither talked to each other nor operated any controls, but apparently did everything by telepathy. The students reported finding a family from Brazil already living on Jupiter's third moon. The family had been taken there several months ago by the space people, all of whom are blue-eyed blonde similar in appearance to satellites of Nordic origin.

Dear Mom and Dad,

Who says Mexican towns are quite places where people come and stay in and day out? That may have been true once, but not now. Something has definitely changed. While I first came here, Mexican towns were peaceful, able to slow down our electrical system.

While doing so, the UNKNOWN is always near. For a reason to read in the middle light: "For a reason to read in the middle light." I am going to push Clark.

I have complete control over the electrical system. We have been working over the motors of an old battery, like flash lights. These things are not new. I have to be real careful who I write to.

Because most people think I'm crazy when I talk about these things in my life. The sky in front of my door was my eyes. Even without my glasses, I could see like a disk or side of the mountain disk left of the mountain. I was almost that I couldn't even see more.

I just about dropped the phone when I was staring with such a night. I lit up a light, got up a little, 121 were something, and I was just about ready to go.

The girls were so scared. The second on the wall in front of the former station to flow in in our little house. All it lit up was Clark. One more time and then disappear.

Been in Mexico City. Can maybe see motors and lights to go off far & stranded. A few nights before the similar.

Kept telling them that we could see something so they really came out right. Pictures came out of the same time the papers were sold by the time we got to the picture which we are keeping here at the home watching for it night and we hope to.

Low-flying space capsule?

A mystery object swooping over Epping Forest, and speeding towards Waltham Abbey, was seen by RCAF navigator Martin Wiltshire, and his son Hunter, of Upshire.

According to the first letter of the September 3-11 incident, the object was travelling south-east from a northern direction. Then, when about overhead, it curved off westward, increased speed.

"Said Mr. Wiltshire, 'I could see it was a sphere between 1,000 and 1,000 feet'.

The sighting was at 10:30 p.m.

As the object passed direction it changed from a grey to a silver metallic colour as its sun shone on it.

On top could be seen a small tower.

'It wasn't like the traditional flying saucer shape like this - quite capable', Mr. Wiltshire said.

'As it faded away the sky was a perfect blue', he added.

East Habourne Phenomenon

The Basing Memory of September 4 tells how farmer David Hollister and his wife saw a mystery object at 10 p.m. on September 2. The item concludes, "It was an orange light and appeared to be rotating. It was about the size of a tree storm and was spinning for about a minute. It disappeared quickly up into the sky, returned, and was stationary for about a minute, then it vanished altogether."

Report
Saucers
in Mexico

MEXICO CITY, Oct. 13 (Reuters) - Reports of sightings of flying saucers continue to pour into Mexican newspapers, radio, and television offices, sometimes accompanied by hair raising stories of mysterious visitors from outer space.

Tall visitors from outer space, tall with brilliant red eyes but neither mouths nor noses, were described by three women who "aimed to have seen them during a stroll thru a southern suburb of Mexico City."

The creatures were gray in color and wore a "tiny gray suit and boots" which the women said "were in the comic strip."

Ran in Panic

The women said that they ran away in panic and that they eventually fainted. Some scenes were described with luminous saucers with red glow to saucer like objects.

Some however, others darted across the sky "faster than any aircraft," and some performed complicated gyrations.

12 Report 2 Objectives

About 12 persons said the saw two objects zigzagging round the dome and turrets of the capital's fine arts palace one evening. Described as "huge luminous things with intermittent flashing lights," they eventually soared vertically up into the sky until they became "merely tiny dots of light."

A foreign diplomat was reported to have witnessed the display but declined to give his name.

Shoots Blue Sparks

From Jalapa and Villahermosa, near the Gulf of Mexico, and from Tepozlan, 30 miles from Mexico City, came further reports. One described a basketball-sized object which emitted blue sparks and appeared to land and take off again. Another told of a hovering object which discharged yellow, blue, and orange lights from slits in its circumference and "a black-clad man with a gleaming metal rod" holding a gleaming metal rod.

The last-named visitor was said suddenly to have been spotted in a Jalapa street to...

era, and a bull fighter.
City taxi drivers next claimed
a sighting just before dawnâ€”a
saucer which changed color as
it rotated and flew slowly from
west to east across the city.

Call it Star

Officials at the city's airport
control tower said that they
had only seen a "very pretty
bright star" that morning.

Next came the dramatic display of flying saucers which
caused an hour-long traffic
jam in one of the capital's
main boulevards in the midst
of Mexico's Independence
day festivities.

Passing motorists, seeing
crowds of pedestrians staring
upwards, screeched to a halt
and climbed out, ignoring the
hooting of drivers behind them.

Drivers Crane Necks

While lines of cars lengthened, excited citizens craned
their necks to look at what
were said in a half a dozen
luminous orbs, or saucer
shapes, hovering silently in the
clear evening sky, gliding toward each other, and finally
soaring upwards at what people described as crazy speed.

In the same time, over the
western suburb, a luminous
object with a pulsating internal
light hung motionless for half
an hour before mysteriously
disappearing.

For the first time since sometime before, a complete
Mexico City airport control
view was not given. It was
added that something had been
seen.

May Be Satellites

Jefe T. S. Enriquez, airport
supervisor, said that he had
"checked with scientific observers" and that the objects
gained a fixed course, and he
said that he thought it could
have been one of the many
artificial satellites.

But, he said, the second object "appeared to change its
course, accelerated in flight,
disappeared and reappeared
in another direction." He declined to suggest any explanation.

Calls Reports Fantasies

Dr. Ignacio Elias, director
of Tacubaya observatory, dismissed the sightings as "mere
fantasies." He said he had
just been seeing the weather
balloons sent up regularly
lately from his station.

He did not explain why the
balloons, released every day
a few hours before sunset, have
not given rise to saucer reports in the past, nor how the
still gas-filled balloons could
change course in mid-flight,
darting with the wind, could
be mistaken for rapidly dark-

I am having trouble getting pictures because Mr. [redacted] puts them in his file as soon as they come to the house. People are taking them every night though so maybe I will end up with one yet. I'LL KEEP TRYING DAD (don't give up).

There isn't any news from this end of the saucer world. Did the Houston papers or anything with my letter. I hope they did because I told the Lemleys about it and I will feel like a fool if I can't prove it to them. Please let me know in a big hurry. Did you find the books yet for me?

Cuernavaca, Mor.
Mexico
October 2, 1965

Dear Mom and Dad,

Let me start off by saying that the UFOs (the flying saucers) are still seen here in Mexico just about every night. It is the strangest feeling to look up at the sky over Taxco City and see these things flying around. If one had seen these things for only one night I would be able to understand why and how the scientists could try to pass it off as a natural phenomenon. It has gone well past that stage now though and the funny part of the whole thing is that the scientists are just as puzzled as the rest of the people. The observations have been too numerous to be considered as a collection of individual oddities. If only the people could find a way to explain these objects and find out just what the real truth is, I honestly believe that everyone might be able to settle down long enough to at least get one good night's sleep (sleep has been impossible for almost two weeks now).

You say that it is all a natural phenomenon? That it has to be because flying saucers are ridiculous and you don't believe in them and never will? Maybe you are right, who am I to say otherwise. I also want to say that flying saucers were out of the question and that I would follow along with all the other's skeptics and unbelievers, but now things have changed. I am not trying to make my old excuse that "it's natural". However, fellow that it could very well be flying saucers, but again, I am not making this a definite statement. From other space news to the scientific from here on earth, it seems that these things are under governmental jurisdiction of the United States or some other country. I believe until it is brought out in the open, at least it should be explained in some way so that the public can start to settle down before a huge case of mass hysteria develops.

Back in 593 B. C. strange things were seen in the sky by a priest whose name was Ezekiel. The thing he saw are explained in the Bible in the book of EZEKIEL, although chapter 1. He described the objects as being "a wheel within a wheel". He gives a very good description in verses 15-22.

So far there has been nothing to prove there are flying saucers, but no has been able to dis-prove it either. Isn't there anyone in the whole world (or outside) of it) that can tell us something?????

Yes, Mom, I have been receiving your letters in Mexico City, and I appreciate everything. Thank you...

CUERNAVACA POWER FAILURE
BLAMED ON FLYING SAUCERS

CUERNAVACA, Mex. (Special) - A power failure that plunged this city into darkness for three hours Thursday night was blamed on flying saucers by some residents.

Hundreds of persons were without electricity when the power system went out of order. Some witnesses claimed they saw unidentified flying objects hovering over the city just before the blackout occurred.

Will one of you do us a big favor. There are three books in the Lakewood library on Flying Saucers and some of them have some pictures.

They all give a very good account of things that have happened in the past and we would like very much to have a copy of some of the books down here.

Please try to get them for me, if it will INFORMATIVE. I only know of one way to get them and since it is so important I have to ask you to try to do it my way. PLEASE DO THE LIBRARY AND CHECK THESE OUT FOR ME.

IT ISN'T REALLY HARD TO GET A LIBRARY CARD AND IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND I AM SURE THE LADIES THERE WILL HELP YOU FIND THEM.

THEN MAIL THEM HERE TO THIS HOUSE AND I WILL SEND THEM BACK TO YOU IN ONE MONTH UNLESS YOU GIVE ME PERMISSION TO JUST SEND YOU THE MONEY FOR THEM.

IT ISN'T HARD FOR THE LIBRARY TO GET MORE AND REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO US DOWN HERE. PLEASE SEND THEM AIR MAIL-SPECIAL HERE TO THE HOUSE AND WRITE (HERO-books) ON THE PACKAGE SO THEIR WON'T BE ANY PROBLEM.

Please try to hurry, I think we are all goings nuts and I think the books will help us understand things a little more.

Who says Mexican towns are quite places where life is the same day in and day out? That may have been partially true up until three days ago, but now something has definitely interfered with the so called "quiet life". For some unexplainable reason, an UNKNOWN power seems to be able to knock out our electrical system in a matter of seconds and, while doing so, the UNKNOWN is able to call the sky light. For a person to read by the middle of the night when the sky is suppose to be pitch black. Not only does this UNKNOWN seem to have complete control over the electrical systems, evidently it is able to have control over the motors of cars and things that run on batteries, like flash lights. Twice during can also be knocked out at will. I have to be real careful who I write and tell this news to because most people will think the crazy in telling you and Sue though. On Thursday night about 11:10 p.m. I walked out of my bedroom and saw this strange thing. I'd never seen in my life. The sky in front of my door was so bright it really hurt my eyes. Even without my glasses, I could see something that looked like a disk on our side of the mountain down in the valley to the left of Cuernavaca. It was almost on the ground and I was so scared that I could even move. Finally I screamed loud as I could and drove running out of the house and just about dropped that time. A doctor from Mexico City was staying with us that night and he saw it too. We watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes before we could not see it anymore. It then rose up a little higher, not even brighter, turned the sky a blue color then disappeared. It looked like a doctor's car from a Paster train or something I ever seen. It looked the lights out to the whole town. I mean just so many lights that there in the dark was a big light and everything was pitch black.

The next morning so scared they just stayed in their rooms but later came out. It appeared two more times in about that same place and once right over the town. I know now, but this time, another transformer also caused the transformer to blow up in another little town real close by so of course this can be put down to a transformer also. Then it appeared one more time and then disappeared for the night. Since then it has been completely quiet. A few more times and one time it caused all the car motors and lights to go off for 40 minutes. The city was completely transplant. A few nights before the Lemays finally saw it, Marilyn and I kept telling them that we could see something in the sky but everybody would call them it would disappear so of course they didn't believe us. Two nights later when they were in the same area, they knew I had seen something so they really came out in a hurry and sure enough, I was right. Rumors came out of the one in Mexico City last night but all the papers were sold out by the time we got down town so we only have one picture which we are keeping here as the house, we are taking turns watching for it the next time. We hope to get a picture of it the next time.

Flying Saucer Reports
Flying Across Mexico

By TERRANCE W. McGARRY
MEXICO CITY (UPI)â€”Four men said they saw a huge flying saucer landing only a few miles from here late Tuesday night and government officials said they might have seen some reports at least.

The increasing rash of flying saucer sightings continued today with students saying they were going to come around toward them, they said.

A number of residents claim to have seen the object which was described as disc-shaped and metallic.

The saucer architecture was described as being similar to other sightings reported in Mexico and other parts of the world.

These much-talked-about sightings at a time when the country is in the midst of a tense political situation have been made a subject of speculation.

The government students said they had previous sighting on Jan. 26 and other unidentified flying objects had been seen.

Taken for a ride
MEXICO CITY, Wednesday (UPI)â€”Tourist native to Mexico has narrowly escaped being judged from some reports at least half the increase from other space.

Four men said they saw a saucer land near the National was quickly denied it.

The army quickly denied that any unidentified flying saucer they say a saucer had been seen landing near Tepotzotlan, 25 miles northwest of Mexico City.

Other reports came in that a flying saucer had landed in a nearby province and the army tried to intercept and force down any unidentified flying object.

One unfortunate Mexico City resident is going to spend the day on the carpet today for allegedly taking a flying saucer for a ride.

Despite all the opportunities, no one seems to have found a convenient landing spot for the saucer-travelers.

THE DAILY SUN
Mon., Sept. 13, 1965

Residents of the Tepozo area claimed the saucer was seen hovering over the area. The army denied that any unidentified flying saucer was in the high command's most of the year, having died down somewhat. But the army says now they have several located posts in the area and are ready to track down any unidentified flying objects.

Maybe they like mile posts and fences.

outside during the three hours everything was happening and we both realized a very sudden change in the temperature after the first sighting. It had been cool, in fact even chilly, to an within a matter of seconds it was downright cold. The weather may not have been affected by the object but I thought I should mention it just in case. I cannot be a judge as to the size of the object except to say that it was extremely large.

Wish I could remember more of the details, if I do think of anything else I will let you know. Meanwhile, I still suggest that you get in contact with the [redacted] in Mexico. Don't know what good it will do, being that you don't even know me, but I will personally vouch for the Lanleys.

I don't believe you will ever have the opportunity to meet anyone more honest and reliable anywhere in the world.

Thank you again, Dr. Hynek. I hope this letter will be of some help.

Sincerely,

notices a very bright object lighting up the valley somewhere between the mountains and our house, approximately five or six miles away. The [redacted] daughters
and I had been seeing some strange things in the sky a few nights prior to this
but by the time I'm and [redacted] could get outside the objects had always disappeared. I'm not really sure of the date but I believe the main sightings
took place on either the 17th or 18th of September. I stood there watching the
object for about thirty seconds to see if it was going to disappear, and then
decided to call Mrs. [redacted]. It took me another fifteen to thirty seconds
to find my voice and for everyone to come outside. When I first saw the object it
was a fairly clear light but by the time everyone was outside, the object was
pale blue and had an odd shape. Everyone seemed to agree that the shape was
oblong, looking somewhat like a cylinder except more streamlined. The object
cast off many different shades of colors, brown being near like a star, to blue,
green, yellowish, to orange. It also seemed to be hovering up and down but I
don't believe it was revolving. During this time when the object got extremely
bright, all the lights in the city went off and a transformer in a nearby town
blew up for some unexplained reason. A flash light was located during this
time but it wouldn't work. Then when the city lights came back on, the flashlight also came on. I would say the object was visible for four or five
minutes and was seen by all eleven people in the [redacted] house. The object
didn't leave like an airplane; it seemed to move upward for a short distance
and then disappeared in a split second. We saw it for the first time around
11:30 p.m. and then again around 1:30 a.m. The second time we saw it we had
about the same view only not for that length of time. We heard the Mexico
City-Acapulco airplane pass over but I believe that was the only sound audible.
About 2:30 a.m. we decided it wasn't going to happen again so we all went to
bed. The next morning we read in the newspaper that it had appeared again,
around 3:00 a.m. One thing I forgot to mention, Mrs. [redacted] and I stood

Dear Dr. Hynek,

Let me start off by thanking you and Mr. Vallee for calling on Thursday, November 25. It is really a pleasure to finally be in contact with someone that is truly interested in the Mexican UFO's from the scientific viewpoint instead of just looking at it from the humorous side. To me the sightings were definitely exciting, scary and weird â€” but humorous â€” and I don't think I could have laughed at that time if my life had depended on it. That is one of the reasons the [redacted] and I haven't felt free to mention this to many people.

We all feel that if people want to learn about these things just for laughs, they can read one of the books written by Adamski!

When put on paper, I believe you will find my account of the happening to be rather vague. I will tell you everything I can remember, but for a more detailed account I will advise you to get in touch with Mrs. [redacted].

Vol. [redacted], Jiutepec, Morelos, Mex.; [redacted], who wasn't quite as shaken up by the sightings as the rest of us and therefore is able to remember more of the details. Her husband, Mr. [redacted] was also present some of the time but missed part of it when he and Dr. [redacted] of Mexico City, went out in the car to try to get a closer view of the object. Mr. [redacted] has now made a file of the newspaper clippings and pictures printed in Mexico, so through him these articles may be of some help to you.

We had been in Mexico City that evening and the weather had been rainy with a heavy overcast. The weather was bad in Cuernavaca also upon our return that night. We had just finished dinner and had gone to our own rooms for the night. For some reason I walked back outside and couldn't help but

Dear Dr. Hynek,

Ref. the Saucer Rpt. by Ken Keating and Mrs. Veltrie Rpt. calling on the same day, November 28.

It is certainly a pleasure to finally be in contact with someone that is truly interested in the matter. 160's from the scientific view point instead of just distinctly a "from the romance view".

To me the gift you have supplied, writing to the people who could have some of the answers to the saucer was a good pull for me. That is one of the reasons I am writing to many people, as I tell you.

When put on paper, I believe you will find some accounts of the experience to be rather unique. I hope you are able to do some good, and for you a continued success.

TDPT (UFO)  Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mns,30 Apr 68
UFO Observation, September 1965

Coral Gables, Florida  33146

1. Reference your letter of February 15, 1968 with regards to your unidentified observation of September 1965.

2. We have checked our files for sightings from Oklahoma for September 1965. Although there were numerous sightings from other sections of the country, we did not receive any from Oklahoma in September 1965. Your sighting is much too old to investigate, however, we will file it for information purposes.

3. Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention. In the future, if you should observe another UFO, please report it to the nearest Air Force base.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Top of document, partially obscured]
7 Sept 1965

I am writing to you re my handwritten report having stop of (rest is illegible) anything would help me 1965 on (illegible) with (illegible) for helpful to me to send the (rest of first paragraph is largely illegible)

[Middle and lower portions of the document contain text, but much of it is too blurry or faint to confidently transcribe. Some words and partial sentences are visible, but not enough to construct complete, accurate sentences.]

The document appears to be a letter or report, dated 7 September 1965, discussing some event or observation, but significant portions of the text are not clearly legible.

The first few lines of the text are partially illegible, but I can make out some of the text:

[First paragraph is mostly illegible, with only fragments of words visible]

"...likely what I was con-
sidered more or less of
out scientific plagued with a strange
improbability, and could detect
something for about the momentum
after long hours of investigation for a
clear time..."

[The rest of the text continues but becomes increasingly difficult to read with complete certainty. Some words and phrases are visible, but not enough to confidently reconstruct full sentences.]

The document appears to be a handwritten page, typed or scanned in black and white, with some areas of text being clearer than others.

The text in the image is partially illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. Some words and phrases can be made out, but a complete and accurate transcription is not possible. The document appears to be a typewritten report with multiple paragraphs, but the specific content cannot be fully discerned.


- page 49 -

The image appears to be a typewritten or handwritten document page, but the text is quite faint and partially illegible. I can make out some words and fragments, but cannot confidently reproduce the full text. Some words I can partially discern include phrases like "...stated..." and "...think..." but the majority of the text is too blurry to accurately transcribe. The document appears to be a single-spaced, typed or handwritten page with some words and lines that are not clearly readable.
