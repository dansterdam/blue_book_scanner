Dear Sir,

I know damn well it is nothing of ours - He said little Bonner from our area is contacting these objects or else someone from another planet!

I never really believed this till he moved. To the county I have seen what I have - If I could only get pictures at least once. I do have some slides but it is only a few.

Sincerely,
