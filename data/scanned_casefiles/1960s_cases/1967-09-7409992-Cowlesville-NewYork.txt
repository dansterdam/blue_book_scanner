Dear Sir,
I have been employed at the Baia Grande Field Club for the past 14 years and this is where I received your address from some one who told them it was my name and address. 
I would like to relate to you what I have witnessed.
On September 1st at exactly 9:50 P.M., I was walking from my home to the Club, taking a secondary road, (the main road is about 1/2 mile from the Club) when I was suddenly lighted by a brilliant light rising from beyond a nearby wood. As I looked up I was almost blinded by the brilliance of this light, it was about 50 yards from me and appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. It was saucer shaped and seemed to be made of polished chrome or aluminum. 
It hovered for a few minutes, and then after making a slight hissing sound, it took off rapidly in a westerly direction disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. As it took off the whole area was lighted up as bright as day. 
I was so amazed that I almost forgot to breathe. After a while I regained my composure and hurried to the Club to report what I had witnessed.

Content of the document:

My parents visited a UFO last night Messrs a 12 by 35 foot landed on Gardiners Island. The center was a brilliant blue, large beam of light in the center. A brilliant blue-white flame shooting out from the center. The flames were about 15 feet long. The craft hovered for about 30 minutes.
Four people came out of the craft men and woman and one thing they did not seem human made observes about 200 yards from us. They did things I cannot explain. My parents tried to contact them but they did not give us a chance to come near. The craft took off straight up and disappeared into the night sky.
