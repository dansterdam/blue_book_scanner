THE BEST DESCRIPTION WAS MADE BY A CIVILIAN CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR WHO SAID IT ACTED MUCH LIKE A METEOR, EXCEPT IT WAS THE BRIGHTEST ONE HE HAD EVER SEEN. HE ESTIMATED HAVING SEEN APPROXIMATELY TEN TO FIFTEEN METEORS OR "FALLING STARS" IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. HOWEVER HE WOULD NOT SAY IT DEFINITELY WAS ASTRONOMICAL. HE STATED FURTHER THAT SALT LAKE CENTER HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL AIRBORNE REPORTS OF THIS SAME OBJECT WITH AT LEAST ONE OBSERVATION AS FAR NORTH AS WENDOVER UTAH.
