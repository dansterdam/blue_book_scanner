There is no photograph present in this page of the UFO report document. The text appears to be a detailed description of observations related to a UFO sighting.

PAGE THREE BEING IS INDIA NO ACTION TAKEN. PILE ALL DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN BY THE FOUR WITNESSES IN CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE WITH SAME EXCEPT FOR LENGTH OF OBSERVATION. THE BEST DESCRIPTION WAS MADE BY A CIVILIAN CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR WHO SAID IT ACTED MUCH LIKE A METEOR, EXCEPT IT WAS BRIGHT ONLY FOR A VERY SHORT TIME. HE ESTIMATED HAVING SEEN APPROXIMATELY TEN TO FIFTEEN METEORS OR "FALLING STARS" IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. HOWEVER HE WOULD NOT SAY IF IT DEFINITELY WAS OR WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT. HE STATED FURTHER THAT SAINT JAMES CENTER HAS "RECEIVED" SEVERAL AIRBORNE REPORTS OF THIS SAME OBJECT WITH AT LEAST ONE OBSERVATION AS FAR NORTH AS SAN ANTONIO. THE OBJECT IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN SEEN BY A LARGE NUMBER OF WITNESSES. WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO CONFER WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE LOWRY OBSERVATORY AT FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA, WHO REPORTED THEY HAD GOOD COVER OF THE SKY OVER ARIZONA AND REPORTED THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING ODD.
