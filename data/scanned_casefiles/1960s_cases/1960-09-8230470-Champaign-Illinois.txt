10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Yellow(ish)-white object, oval in shape, four times size of Echo I. Object appeared to wobble, had straight flight path, stopped, appeared to grow smaller, and faded from sight.

11. COMMENTS
A jet aircraft at high altitude would be high enough to reflect the sun even though the sun previously set. This is probably what the two witnesses saw.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

TO: Operations Service Division (OSD)

1. On 23 September 1960 (Zulu Time) Champaign reported to WCIA-TV that they had jointly observed an Unidentified Flying Object in the sky north west of Champaign. The following is a report of their observation.

a. Description of object:
(1) Oval in shape
(2) Four times the size of Echo I
(3) Yellowish-white in color
(4) One object
(5) Negative formation
(6) Negative discernible features or details
(7) Negative tail or exhaust
(8) No sound
(9) The object appeared to wobble

b. Description of Course of object:
(1) The observers were watching the stars when they first noticed the object.
(2) The object was first observed at approximately 000°, elevation 50°.
(3) The object was last observed at approximately 315°, elevation 45°.
(4) Straight flight path, negative maneuvers.
(5) Object stopped, appeared to grow smaller, and faded from sight.

(c) Object was visible for approximately ten minutes.

c. Manner of observation:
(1) Ground-visual, with the unaided eye

d. Time and date of sighting:
(1) 0940 Z, 23 September 1960
(2) Dusk

e. Location of observers:
(1) 40° 07'N, 88° 15'W; Champaign, Illinois.

f. Identifying information on observers:
(1) [Redacted text]

Persons have no experience as observers and have no technical knowledge. They seemed to be quite impressionable; however, their honesty was sincere.

g. Weather and winds - Aloft conditions at time of sighting:
(1) Observers account - Clear sky and calm wind.
(2) Report of Chanute AFB

40,000 - -46.50C 1.380 C/M
50,000 - -60.30C

1. There were no activities such as balloon launchings in the area or meteorological activities which could account for this sighting. The observer saw this at the same time they were watching this UFO and it was traveling in the opposite direction.

2. Comments of preparing Officer:
a. The boys who observed this object were very young and impressionable. Their judgment of elapsed time and estimated angles was very inaccurate. However, they were quite positive as to the shape, size, and color of the object.

b. The object could not have been a balloon because its direction of motion is counter to the winds at all altitudes. An aircraft flight would have appeared much smaller unless it was an aircraft looking for the engine to be lost. And there were no known earth satellites which could have been produced.

c. The description of the object as given by the boys reminds me of an object I observed under similar conditions some time ago. The object I observed, just after dusk, was a high flying bomber with a short vapor trail. The bomber and vapor trail were reflecting the same light to give the same visual effect as described by these boys. I believe this is what they observed.
