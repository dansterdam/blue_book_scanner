MEMORANDUM:

Called Mr. [redacted] in San Antonio Moonwatch team last week, who was also works in the TV control room of a local TV station. He did not see the object in question, and referred me to Mr. [redacted] the only witness. [redacted], upon being contacted, that he was been on the moonwatch team since the first Sputnik went up. He is a physicist in the Trinity University. He stated that he was in his home and one of his children was outside. The wild run in and cried that there was a satellite going over. Mrs. [redacted] looked at the clock and it showed 1710 hours.

[redacted] went outside and he looked at about 280 deg at east of 35 deg and saw an object yellowish-white in color that appeared to be 5 times the size of Venus with naked eye. He said that it appeared to be larger than Sputnik I, but traveled across the sky at the same speed. As there was trees to the NE of the observer and the object went behind the trees. The object could still be seen through the branches, and when it was about 5 deg above horizon it seemed to curve to the right. The object disappeared at about 350 degrees just above north. It was viewed for 3 minutes.

Mr. [redacted] said that as discussed this sighting with other moonwatch officials and they said the curve he saw was natural for a satellite. He said this curve was the only reason he thought it was something out of the ordinary.

This sighting occurred the 19 September 1960.

Analysis and Conclusions: There were no satellites over the area at the time. The witness was probably watching a high flying aircraft along one of the several air lanes leading from San Antonio, and the act being to the west and at a north of their altitude could be in sunlight. The witness it would appear did to the observers who were in darkness.
