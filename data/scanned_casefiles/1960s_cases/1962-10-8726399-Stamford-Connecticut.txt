Gentlemen:

I am writing you this letter at the urging of a friend who thought that the information contained herein may be of value to your agency or some other Governmental Office.

On the evening of October 17, 1962, around 6:30 PM, EDT, I was cleaning the gutters on the roof of my house and I stopped to rest a few minutes. As I laid on the roof, looking up at the sky, I noticed a bright shining object moving across the sky from the North-East to the North-West. The object seemed to jump as it moved. It moved approximately 100 ground yards in about two(2) minutes. At this point it started to turn and come back, headed towards where I had originally seen it. At this point I called to my brother-in-law, Mr. [redacted], Stamford, who was at the house with his wife, to watch the object also. It was then that we saw two(2) more objects, one coming from the North-East, and one from the South. They all came together including the first one I saw, more or less forming a triangle.

They stayed together for about a half a minute, then the

First object started back on its North-Westerly course while the other two parted, one going North and the other South. After parting, (the two that had gone North and South), they seemed to disappear about 15 seconds after starting to move. The first object, I followed, still going in a North-Westerly direction until it was out of view.

As I stated in the beginning of this letter, I do not know whether or not this information is of any value to your agency, and if not, but it may be to same other agency such as the Air Force, would you kindly see that they get it if it will be of value to them.

Thank You.

Stamford, Connecticut
