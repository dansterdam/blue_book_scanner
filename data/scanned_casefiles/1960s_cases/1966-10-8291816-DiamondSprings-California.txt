A check with the Dept Creations of Weather, California, reveals there were no unusual weather phenomena observed or reported in the Diamond Springs, California, area on the date in question. The VHF station is located 10 miles northeast (90.20) of the base boating station.

In view of the number of aircraft flying in the Diamond Springs, California, area and the description of the object given, it is the opinion of the officer that the sighting was of a high flying jet aircraft reflecting sunlight.
