Horseshoe shaped obj about 1/3 diameter of moon observed for 1/1/2 seconds. Bright orange, appeared as a dark patch on the moon at the 10 o'clock position. Initially attracted by a bright flash on the horizon. Moon at this time was observed at 1-2 dgrs above the horizon. This obj appeared below the border of the moon. Faded. Light conditions were just before dawn. Moon was beginning to appear (rising).

one

11. COMMENTS
Moon was at 10.12021 RA at 0300 & 10.14.19 at 0400. Declination was between 13.23 & 13.14. Position was very close to Regulus at this time. Regulus was at 10 with a declination of 13, Possibly a mirage associated with the star Regulus and the Moon or possibly the refraction of the moon itself prior to its rising, in any case, the sighting was due to the moon's rising and the optical conditions present
