11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer "A" sighted 3 objects, all were aluminum colored and appeared solid. The first was oval shaped. The second was a two-piece object with an umbilical cord connecting the two. The second part was turning as if trying to get shape of the 3rd part. The 3rd one was round and all objects were going west. No gas or strange sounds made no noise. Also Observer "A" saw 2 objects, one second square and one added round. One additional object was hovering over. It was uncertain of the direction the objects moved, how to be classified each had a duration of about 1 minute. No aircraft in the area either. The objects were in the vicinity of 15 seconds per object (15 seconds total) and could be as far as 1/2 mile. It also stated that observers stated that they could hear no noise from UFO's because of the noise from a small aircraft.

Commented: No one else either in the park or in Kirksville seems to have seen the objects. Object # 2891 could have descended at or near this time but would not have been going only. Local airports were asked if they had any aircraft in the area, particularly-ones testing advertising gizmos, however none of the airports responded to the letter. The original wire reported 7 aircraft in the area, all flying low level. Nothing was reported to the volunteer 2 flight office network. Because of the conflict in duration, number of objects and because witnesses later responded negative on aircraft in the area, the case is being carried as conflicting data.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letters of May 6th and May 7th.

In checking the VFON pilot report files I find no report for August 20th 1967 between the hours of 23002 and 23302.

There is likewise no report for October 6th, 1967 anywhere near the Northeast area of the U.S.A.

A continuous check of the March files still show no report for March 24th, 1968 between the hours of 01032 to 01152.

I am very sorry that I have been unable to help you with any of the above requests. Please be sure to write if there is anything further that I might be able to help you with.

Sincerely Yours
