1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 20 AUG 67 - 2050
2. LOCATION: Thousand Hills State Park, Mo. (Missouri)
3. SOURCES: Civilian
4. SUMMARY OF OBJECTS: Two spherical objects
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 minutes
6. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
7. CONCLUSION: Other (CONFLICTING DATA)
8. OTHER (CONFLICTING DATA): The report states that the two objects were initially observed and described as metallic, disc-shaped objects. However, they later appeared to become spherical in shape. The objects were initially 3-5 degrees in the sky, then dropped 2 degrees and disappeared over the horizon. The observers reported that the objects made no sound and that they were not airplanes. The conclusion notes that the data was conflicting, with the observers initially describing the objects as disc-shaped and later as spherical.

10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED.

They were apparently the most unimpressive, and may have been the result of an entirely natural condition during the night. Some say its appearance, or the phenomenon rather, was hardly of any great interest whatsoever, as far as they could tell from their observation. They certainly did not feel this was anything of a remarkable nature.

CONDITIONS (Check appropriate blocks.)

CLOUD COVER (Form Wind): THIN, CIRRUS SCATTERED 
PRECIPITATION: NONE
MOON: PARTLY CLOUDY
WIND: UNKNOWN

LIGHTING AVAILABLE AT TIME OF SIGHTING OR OBSERVATION
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT, MOON  HIDDEN BY CLOUDS, STARLIGHT

TO YOUR LEFT TO YOUR RIGHT
(Specify the major source of illumination present during the sighting, such as the sun, headlights or street lights. Also, compare the sighting with other observed objects, like stars. A light or other illumination object may indicate the shape, size, and movement of the sighting.)

12. SIZE AND SPEED OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED SMALL OR LARGE, FAST OR SLOW, AND DESCRIBE ITS MOTION IF THERE WAS ANY.
It seemed rather mundane, with trifling maneuvers that were hardly of note.
They were seen quite clearly, but there was nothing remarkable about their behavior or appearance.
There was nothing at all unusual about what they saw in the sky that night, as far as they could make out.
The lights moved in a manner that seemed quite ordinary, and provided no indications of any special or unusual qualities. They came and went with very little to observe that was of any interest.
In short, this incident was considered most unimpressive, and was felt to be a product of natural conditions prevailing at the time, rather than anything special or extraordinary.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

"Objects. No case either in the park or in Kirksville seems to have been observed that could have been seen as a UFO, LUFON reports. Local airports were asked if they had any UFO reports during this period, particularly concerning objects flying at low levels. Nothing was reported. The case is therefore inconclusive. Number of objects reported as sightings later confirmed negative or uncertain on further examination. The case is being carried as inconclusive as confirming data."

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letters of May 6th and May 7th.

In checking the VFON pilot report files I find no report for August 20th 1967 between the hours of 2200Z and 2300Z.

There is likewise no report for October 6th, 1967 anywhere near the Northern Great Circle of the U.S.A.

A continuous check of the March files still show no report for March 24th, 1968 between the hours of 0103Z to 0112Z.

I am very sorry that I have been unable to help you with any of the above requests. Please let me know if there is anything further that I might be able to help you with.

Sincerely Yours,

H. T. Roth, Project Director
Volunteer Flight Officer Network
