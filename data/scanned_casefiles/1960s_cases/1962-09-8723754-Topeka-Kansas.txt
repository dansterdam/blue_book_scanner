The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a project record card from Project 10073. The card provides details about a sighting that occurred on September 3, 1962 in Topeka, Kansas. The sighting involved a drop-shaped object of silver color which was observed for 15-20 minutes. The card lists the location, type of sighting, description of the object, and various conclusions about the sighting, such as that the direction of flight was not reported, and the sighting was consistent with this analysis.
