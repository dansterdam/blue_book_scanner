ODESSA, DELAWARE 
Unidentified; but based entirely on a NICAP report. On the basis 
of the information given, no identification seems possible. Too bad 
that a competent AF investigation was not made.

Unidentified but good sightings on the basis of information given. On the question of reliability, there is some indication of this person having a background of scientific interest and some training in observation, so that he may be reasonably reliable. The descriptions given, while not extremely detailed, seem plausible and the observations appear to have been made with some care.

"Case has been closed. All I have is the ATIC report. The Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case. All I have is the AFOSR report. Evaluation pending my getting a copy of the Air Force investigation of the same. Based on what investigation, the sighting is considered unidentified."

"I have only the card on this case, but judging from the information indicated, this one-witness case seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was observed with perfect lighting conditions. The sighting lasted 5 to 10 seconds, and no other particulars are indicated."

This report was never formally investigated by Dover AFB due to a breakdown in communications. With the meager information available to Project Blue Book, this particular case is considered to be unidentified.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFRDC 1 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: COMMANDER
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, WASHINGTON, D.C. 20331

1. On 1 February 1967, this office received a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Odessa, Delaware at approximately 1930 hours on 31 January 1967.

2. According to the witness, Mr. John Doe, he was driving home from work at approximately 1930 hours on 31 January 1967 when he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be descending. The object was described as round in shape, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright, orange-colored light. As the object descended, it appeared to hover briefly before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. 

3. Mr. Doe stated that he drove to a nearby farmhouse and reported the sighting to the occupants, who also observed the object. The witnesses described the object as making no sound and leaving no visible trail as it departed the area.

4. This office has conducted an initial investigation of the incident and has found no evidence to suggest a logical, conventional explanation for the sighting. Accordingly, it is classified as an unidentified flying object and is being reported as such.

5. Request any additional information or analysis your office can provide regarding this incident.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYQJG OB'J'EC'I' Donald estimated to be two or three hundred feet off the ground. The object was extremely brilliant, almost blinding to look at. It appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and seemed to be glowing, emitting a very bright light. The witness declared that his eyes were actually dazzled by the brilliance of the object.

The object seemed to be moving rather slowly, much slower than a jet airplane would travel. After making one pass the object then seemed to maintain a stationary position for a period of approximately five minutes. The witness declared that the object appeared to stop and remained motionless as he watched it. During the entire sighting, the object appeared to be giving off a brilliant bluishwhite light.

Donald estimated the size to be two or three hundred feet in diameter. He said that the object seemed to be about three quarters of a mile from where he was standing. It was then that he noticed that the object seemed to be rocking or oscillating back and forth.

Finally, the object began moving again, gaining speed until it disappeared completely from view in a northerly direction. The entire sighting lasted approximately fifteen minutes.

The sound which accompanied the object was very low, almost a hum, very slight, and could be described as a pulsating sound. The witness stated that he could not detect any exhaust or jet-like sounds.

According to the witness, the ground around the area where the object was seen was illuminated in a bluish tint. This bluish illumination extended for some distance on the ground and the witness stated that the illumination was so bright that one could easily have read a newspaper by it.

The witness was very close to the object and could observe it clearly. He stated that the object appeared to be structured, giving the impression of being composed of several layers or sections. Donald was quite certain that what he saw was definitely an unidentified flying object and not an airplane, satellite, or any other known type of aircraft.
