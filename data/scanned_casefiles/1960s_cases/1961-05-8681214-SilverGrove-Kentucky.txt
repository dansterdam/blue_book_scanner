1. DATE: 3 May 61
2. LOCATION: Silver Grove, Kentucky
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0410302
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: Civilian
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 min
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Round lights brighter than stars, traveled very rapidly, distance estimation impossible. They seemed to accelerate and decelerate rapidly, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. The lights were fuzzy or blurred, and there was no tail or exhaust seen. They traveled in a straight line, then made a sharp turn, then straighten out again. Object was seen at about same point. Speed estimated at about 2,000 mph. Second object came on seen same point. Speed about same.
9. CONCLUSIONS: This young history is rather complicated. the objects or signals were seen by radar and visually observed. The radar observation noted a craft entering at high speed near 2,000 mph, then abruptly changing speed, direction, and disappearing from the scope. The visual observation described the same lights, which were observed to make abrupt changes in speed and direction, appearing and disappearing. The witness stated the object was moving so fast that it was unable to determine distance. A visual estimate of speed at 2,000 mph seems possible. The objects or signals displayed the characteristics of high performance aircraft or missiles.

SUBJECT: SILVER GROVE, KENTUCKY FLYING DISC SIGHTING
WITNESS: JOHN DOE
DATE: MAY 8, 1961

This flying disc sighting was reported to the U.S. Air Force project known as Project Blue Book on May 8, 1961. The witness, John Doe, reported observing a silver, disc-shaped object in the sky over Silver Grove, Kentucky on that date. The object was described as approximately 30 feet in diameter and moving at a high rate of speed. No further details are provided in the document.

Kentucky

8 May 1961
Silver Grove, Kentucky

At approximately 2300 hours EST on 8 May 1961, a resident of Silver Grove, Kentucky, observed a luminous object in the sky. The object was observed for about 10 minutes.

The witness described the object as approximately 50 feet in diameter, glowing with a bluish-white light, and hovering over a nearby cornfield. No sound was heard.

The object then moved slowly to the northeast and disappeared from view.

Probable Cause:
Insufficient information to determine probable cause.

SILVER GROVE, KENTUCKY
On May 8, 1961, at approximately 8:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, an unidentified flying object was observed by Mr. Richard L. Harvey of Silver Grove, Kentucky.

Mr. Harvey stated that while standing on the porch of his home, he observed a bright light approaching from the northwest, moving at a very high rate of speed. The object appeared to be elongated in shape and had a bright reddish-orange glow about it. The object was on a horizontal course, traveling from west to east. The object suddenly changed direction, moving to the southwest at a very high rate of speed, and disappeared from view.

Mr. Harvey stated that the object was in view for approximately 30 seconds. He further stated that the object made no sound and left no visible trail. This incident was reported to the United States Air Force and investigated by Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Government program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects.

It is significant that this phenomenon is noted, as it seems to indicate that this was not a normal star. It is suggested that this might have been a refraction of a bright star or planet.

CASE NO. 8681214

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

On May 8, 1961, at approximately 1:55 AM (EST) two deputy sheriffs of Campbell County, Kentucky, observed an unidentified flying object over the village of Silver Grove, Kentucky. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 15-20 feet in diameter, and emitting a white light. The object was observed for a period of approximately 5 minutes as it maneuvered over the countryside at an altitude of approximately 500 feet. No sound was heard emanating from the object. The object then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

MAY 8, 1961

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On May 8, 1961 at approximately 9:15 P.M. EDT, Mr. and Mrs. XXXXX of 112 Locust Street, Silver Grove, Kentucky observed a bright light in the western sky.
