Here is the OCR text from the document:

April 13, 1963

Sir,

One Friday, we had just finished praying in the mosque when a sound was heard overhead. That was in November or December when we came out of the mosque we saw a smoke trail which extended from horizon to horizon. A plane description it burned a little low then a rapid downward end into another trail. While cloud shine it disappeared. I do not know started at the horizon or at the cloud. That was about 1/2 pm East Africa Time. No one actually saw what object had produced the smoke but many persons actually saw the smoke trail which was perfectly motionless and seemed to span one the white clouds. I do not remember the date.

The sky was not remember from 3 to 5 o'clock. There was no fog and our view was clear. Being a warm day. The buildings there do not have stories and so most of the sky can be seen. Suppose a small height is estimated about 35-40 E 10's.

The altitude is unknown to me. Before G-MT and E.A standard time there is difference 3 hrs. It E.A.T = G.M.T + 3 hrs. The height, smoke cannot be estimated. And because lack of precise and experience and because of time that has passed. The breadth of the smoke can not be said with accuracy.

I am a bit short sighted. There were as near as few to 15m or more we saw the smoke including some persons from the nearby downtown hotel.

We thought that rocket might have been

it might be burning away as it reaches the atmosphere. But no smoke was not scattered but had turned towards earth point dust.
