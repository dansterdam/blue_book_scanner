11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted a bright red light low on the horizon at 2325. The sky was overcast and no stars could be seen because of the thick clouds. The object remained stationary and no noise was heard.

COMMENTS: There are numerous red high rise warning lights at an airport near Fairborn because of the air traffic to W-AFB. It is probable that the observer was observing one of these lights. However on 24 Jan 66 the observer was telephoned to determine if she had continued to observer the light. Again having reported to the O.D. The observer stated that she had been so near to the O.D. as received by the O.D. was read to the witness but she replied that she had seen so many that she couldn't remember.

T, LOG P DIAGRAM
(ILLIBAR)

EXPLANATION
23-7 ISOBARS are slant, horizontal brown lines. The heights in feet of the
pressure surface in the ICAO Standard Atmosphere are in parentheses (')
below the pressure value on the left.

22

ISOTHERMS (°C) are the straight, equidistant brown lines running
diagonally upward from left to right.

21

DRY ADIABATS are the slightly curved brown lines that intersect the
1000 mb. isobar at intervals of 2°C and run diagonally upward from
right to left.

20

SATURATED ADIABATS are the curved green lines that intersect the
1000 mb. isobar at intervals of 2°C, diverging upward and tending to
become parallel to the dry adiabats. Values appear in the upper part of
the diagram (°C mil.)

19

SATURATION MIXING RATIO (in gm. per kg.) is represented by dotted
green lines. The values appear at the bottom and middle of the diagram.

18

ICAO STANDARD ATMOSPHERE SOUNDING is indicated by a thick brown
line.

The saturated adiabats and isotherms of saturation mixing ratio are
compiled by use of vapor pressure over a plane water surface at all
temperatures.

17

APPROXIMATE VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE may be obtained from the
formula Tv=T+ε(e/p) where Tv is virtual temperature in °C, Tis the air
temperature in °C, e is the vapor pressure in millibars, ρ is the pressure
of thickness computation, and the mean temperature of the layer for Tv
and the mean mixing ratio of the layer for e.

16

Black dots along wind scale lines indicate the levels for which wind
data are reported and plotted. The open circles indicate the mandatory
pressure levels at which wind data are also entered.

The rest of the text is too illegible to confidently transcribe. The document appears to be a detailed table or log sheet with multiple columns and rows, typical of military or scientific record-keeping documents from the 1960s. The image is a black and white scanned document with some fading and image quality degradation.


- page 7 -

The document appears to be an "ADIABATIC CHART" with multiple grid sections and tables. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The only legible text I can confidently make out is the title "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text appears to be numerical data and grid entries that are not clearly readable in this scanned image.


- page 8 -

The image appears to be a grid or table-like document with very dense, small text that is largely illegible due to the low contrast and small font size. The document seems to be a form or data sheet with numerous rows and columns, printed on what looks like an old, slightly degraded document. The edges of the page are visible, and the document appears to be from a vintage file or report.

ADIABATIC CHART

(The rest of the text is too small or blurry to reliably OCR without potential errors. The document appears to be a technical chart with numerous rows and columns, with "ADIABATIC CHART" clearly visible at the top right of the page.)


- page 13 -

The image appears to be a grid or chart with vertical and horizontal lines. The text is too illegible to read clearly. The page has hole punches on the left side, indicating it is part of a bound document. The image is in black and white and looks like a data sheet or graph paper with some faint markings or data points within the grid.


- page 14 -

The image appears to be a data table or log sheet with multiple columns and rows. The text is quite faint and partially illegible due to the low contrast black and white scan. The document seems to be a detailed record or log with numerical entries across various columns. There are three hole punches visible on the left side of the document, suggesting it was part of a binder or file. The header of the document is partially visible but not fully readable. The majority of the text consists of numerical entries that are difficult to transcribe with complete accuracy.


- page 15 -

Most of the text on this page is too illegible to accurately transcribe. The document appears to be a detailed table or log sheet with multiple columns and rows, typical of a data recording form from the 1960s. The page has three hole punches on the left side, indicating it was part of a binder or file. The image quality is very low contrast, making most of the text and numbers unreadable.


- page 16 -

The image appears to be a detailed tabular document with multiple columns and rows. Most of the text is too small and blurry to read clearly. The document looks like a data log or record sheet with numerous entries, dates, and numerical values. The page is numbered "2" in the top right corner, and there are three hole punches visible on the right side of the document, suggesting it is part of a larger bound report or file. The image is a black and white scanned document with some degradation and graininess typical of older photocopied or archived materials.


- page 17 -

Due to the low contrast and image quality, much of the text is illegible. I can partially make out "MAGNETIC CHART" at the top right of the document, and "DAYTON, OHIO" at the bottom right. The document appears to be a form or chart with many grid-like sections and boxes, but the specific text within those sections is too blurry to accurately transcribe.


- page 18 -

The image appears to be a scanned document with a dense grid or table layout. However, the text is too faint and blurry to be legibly read through OCR. Most of the page consists of very light gray grid lines and text that is not clearly distinguishable.


- page 19 -

The image appears to be an Adiabatic Chart with a complex grid of numbers and lines. The text "ADIABATIC CHART" is visible at the top right of the document. The majority of the page consists of a detailed grid with numerous rows and columns filled with small numbers and markings. On the right side of the page, there are several smaller boxes with text, though most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. At the bottom right, there seems to be some additional text, but it is not legible in this image.


- page 20 -

This image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The grid lines are dense and cover the entire page, creating a complex network of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. There are some faint markings or notations along the left margin of the page, but the text is too illegible to read clearly. The image is in black and white and looks like a technical or scientific document page, possibly a data recording sheet or plotting graph.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

24 Jan 1968

Called Mrs. [redacted] requesting her 11 May 1967 sightings.

Mrs. [redacted] called the Duty Officer and stated that she had been observing a red light near the horizon for about 1/2 min. I asked Mrs. [redacted] if she had continued to observe the object after having reported it, and if so how long had she observed it. Mrs. [redacted] replied that she has seen numerous UFO's and that she didn't recall this sighting at all. I then read the contents of the report to her to refresh her memory but after I had finished she repeated that she had seen so many that she still couldn't remember the sighting.
