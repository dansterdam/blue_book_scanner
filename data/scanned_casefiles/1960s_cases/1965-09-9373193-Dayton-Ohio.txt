From: [redacted]

Subject: Meteor

On the evening of September 7th, at about 7:10 PM I was riding a bike in a generally Southwest direction (West by South) when I saw the Meteor.

I started to look over my left shoulder(or to the south) to check on traffic behind me when I saw the meteor.

It was about 60° off the horizon and looked to be travelling the same direction that I was taking.

I watched it for perhaps three or four seconds and then it burned out.

There were no cars or any farm equipment close by, and it was very quiet. There was absolutely no noise from the fireball.

Later, as I changed my course to one of almost due south I glanced around to see if any other objects were in the sky, but there were none. Nor, did I see any sign of the meteor after it burned out.

I'm sure this was a meteor - and it was a beaut!

Meteorite Seen Streaking Across Sky

"Did you see it?"
"Most fantastic thing I've ever seen!"

"It sort of shot across the sky," said John Cox, a local resident. Several persons saw what has been described as a meteorite streaking across the sky about 8:30 last night.

Mr. and Mrs. John Cox of Southwest, however, were standing in the backyard and saw their neighbors.

"It's speed was fantastic," said Cox, who estimated it was in sight only about three seconds.

Cox said it traveled in an east to west direction.

Off said it traveled in almost level flight and had a trajectory.

ory much like that of a plane, which led him to believe that it was something other than a meteorite or other astronomic body.

There were varied descriptions of the meteorite — one being that it appeared as a blue-bright orange glow with a bright trail. Another said it appeared to be a "white-hot" object while another said it as having a greenish tinge.

The fact that it looked like a huge "dinner plate" hurtling through space was more or less agreed upon.

The meteorite was burning up in the earth's atmosphere and was seen in a wide band that extended from as far north as Cincinnati down to London.

Everyone that saw the phenomenon agreed that it was a fantastic sight.

logical explanation for it.

"One report said it was a

there's no satellite that is
Kelly green with a long
yellow tail that a flying
object would have a green glow on the side
walk."

That's the report he said
he received from a large

the object while walking with

Other calls came from one
end of the county to the

Apparently came shortly after 7 p.m. and lasted

Colorado Springs, Colorado

Dear General:

In re: Missile over Kentucky

In the late afternoon of September 7th, at just about 6:00 o'clock Central Standard Time, (7 p.m. Daylight) I saw passing Paris, Kentucky, a flying missile, on an approximate southeast to northwest course.

The rounded forward end of this missile was illuminated by the setting sun in the west. The missile was tubular in shape and had a gold metallic appearance. There was mist or white cloud around the missile, from away behind the head on aft.

The trajectory followed the surface of the earth at about a 90° angle to the earth, as viewed by me.

The missile left a light greenish-yellow or yellowish-green vapor behind where it sped out of sight.

The missile, or some other flying object or objects, was seen by people at the time all the way from Louisville to Cincinnati, but I had a grandstand view - I was seated on the terrace of the swimming pool at Claiborne House, the owner's home on the great Claiborne Farm horse breeding establishment, where my brood mares are boarded. I saw the missile emerge from behind some trees on my far right, and speed across the sky until it went out of sight.

This missile went at the speed of a super-sonic plane, or perhaps two or three times that speed.

There was no sound.

Mrs. [redacted] seated by my side at the time, and accustomed to outdoor observation, said immediately, "That was a warhead."

Articles are attached from Paris, Kentucky, Daily Enterprise and the Cincinnati Enquirer, relative to object or objects seen by others at approximately the same time, the early evening of September 7th.

Is it possible a stage of the missile may have dropped off in the vicinity?

At any rate [redacted] and I saw the warhead itself.

In re: Missile over Kentucky

What has been written here about a flying missile need not be discounted in any way, and can be taken 100% for granted. I am highly trained in outdoor observation, having spent in the aggregate half a dozen years of my life ranging coastal and intercostal waters of this country aboard my yachts. If a person spent six years of his life in a rowboat, he would have to look sharp for his safety. You can appreciate the need for careful observation in long range cruising.

If Cape Kennedy cannot account for the missile, then I suggest most earnest consideration of origin from Cuba.

Sincerely,

P.S: A check with a compass shows that I was looking almost due northeast, actually on a 40° sight, when the missile passed by from my right to my left.

Dear Sir;

For what it is worth please consider the following as a report of interest and discussion.

Before I became involved in this report may I state certain of my qualifications relative to this matter.

First I am presently employed as a shop materials purchaser and accounting clerk at Kuhns Bros. Co., Dayton, Ohio. In this capacity I am usually far more right than wrong, or in sum.

As a fully qualified observer I refer to three years of W.W. III service in fire control with 2 and Battalion, 979th F.A. Bn., minus 26 days in the entire combat period in the C.T.G.

I have under 19th Corps, Gen. McBain, C.O. In artillery practice I was fully able to

One of the more critical observations I made was against the attack of an F.W.-190, when it attempted lateral (3 O'clock) approach upon the battery. So called, 50-cal. fire struck his m.g. turning area ahead of the wind screen, deflected aft through the instrumentation and found the point. H.Q. investigation verified the calling and the craft was awarded to S/Sgt Larry Wilkes, of Lansing, Mich., a cook.

As for the news report on the H.F.Q.C. of the past week, may I vary from your finding, as follows:

I was in my back yard after dark when I first sighted the object. It was apparently of low altitude dimensional relationship and I viewed it as near or closely not in shape. There were no projections of any sort and no

It was easily more than twice as bright
as any star or planet visible from this
latitude. Illumination was very bright but
not starkly of gleaming and quite uniform
beyond atmospheric influence. At gleams
rather than glistened and did not distinctly
vary or twinkle.

I judged its rate of progress to be around
three times that of Elint lighting I made
early in that period.

The course slowly south to north, ap-
peared quite steady and unvarying in
magnitude its altitude. It passed from sight
at approximately +20° zenith slightly to the
East of north.

Since I lacked any instruments capable
of triangular application to the sighting I
can only say that it lacked the impression
of being at law great an elevation as some of
the satellite tracking I have seen to op-
eration at altitude. I judged it to be fairly
close in.

As a final point may I state that its pre-
sistent appearance impressed me as being that
of a fair sized object, about the size of a B-52,
but will concede or round. If anything else,
not much larger.

I have observed many entries into the

Dear

Supplementing my December 27th letter on the warhead sighted by me over Paris, Kentucky, in September 1965, what I think may have happened is that after the missile passed by, a stage may have dropped off and disintegrated, producing the effect seen in Cincinnati and Lexington.

I do hope that our naval base in Cuba is equipped with a seismograph, so as to be informed thoroughly about any missile firings from that area.

Sincerely,

Thank you for your December 21st letter explaining the nature of a fireball.

In case you and your colleagues are not already aware of this, Hill Farm in September 1965 was not a fireball, but a guided missile. Just as clearly and definitely identifiable as you were seated across my desk now.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter of December 16 regarding our evaluation of your sighting.

A fireball is a brilliant meteor which is entering the earth's atmosphere at a tremendous velocity. It is a phenomenon which enters the earth's atmosphere at a speed than the normal meteor and enters the earth's atmosphere at a closer distance. Fireballs have been known to light up areas for distances of 20 to 40 miles.

Although we do not normally indorse books pertaining to the subject of unidentified flying objects, you may wish to read The World of Flying Saucers by Donald H. Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd. Fireballs are discussed quite thoroughly in Chapter V.

Thank you for your letter.

Dear General:

In re: Missile over Kentucky

In the late afternoon of September 7th, at just about 6:00 o'clock Central Standard Time, (7 p.m. Daylight), I saw passing Paris, Kentucky, a flying missile, on an approximate northwest to northeast course.

The rounded forward end of this missile was illuminated by the setting sun in the west. The missile was tubular in shape and had a gold metallic appearance. There was mist or white cloud around the missile, from away behind the head an aft.

The trajectory followed the surface of the earth at about a 90° angle to the earth, as viewed by me.

The missile left a light greenish-yellow or yellowish-green vapor behind where it sped out of sight.

The missile, or some other flying object or objects, was seen by people at the time all the way from Louisville to Cincinnati, but I had a grandstand view - I was seated on the terrace of the swimming pool at _______ House, the owner's home on the great _______ Farm horse breeding establishment, where my broad mares are boarded. I saw the missile emerge from behind some trees way off to my far right, and sped across the sky until it went out of sight.

This missile went at the speed of a super-sonic plane, or perhaps two or three times that speed.

There was no sound.

Mr. _______ seated by my side at the time, and accustomed to outdoor observation, said immediately, "That was a warhead."

Articles are attached from Paris, Kentucky, Daily Enterprise and the Cincinnati Enquirer, relative to object or objects seen by others at approximately the same time, the early evening of September 7th.

Is it possible a stage of the missile may have dropped off in the vicinity?

At any rate Mrs. _______ saw the warhead itself.

What has been written here about a flying missile need not be discounted in any way, and can be taken 100% for granted. I am highly trained in outboard observation, having spent in the aggregate half a dozen years of my life ranging coastal and intercostal waters of this country aboard my yachts. If a person spent six years on the line in Viet Nam, he would have to look sharp for his safety. You can appreciate the need for careful observation in long range cruising.

If Cape Kennedy cannot account for the missile, then I suggest most earnest consideration on origin from Cuba.

Sincerely,

PS: A check with a compass shows that I was looking almost due northeast, actually on a 40° sight, when the missile passed my right to my left.
