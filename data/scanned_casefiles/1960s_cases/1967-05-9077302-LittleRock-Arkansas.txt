Yes, it disappeared (was) gradually watching it. I had seen other first after something little while. Coming down maybe - but it was down light you at last to make it still. It moved considerably more watching time did not and it did answer over over will move away.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I don't believe 1/16 or 1/8 it was larger enough to stand at slight distance. Help more that if it was larger than the two cars is good & also seemed to identify it.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow outside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 18 May 67

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and appears to be a detailed narrative description of a sighting, but due to the cursive handwriting, some words are difficult to definitively transcribe. The text describes some kind of aerial sighting near Little Rock, with details about objects and their movement, but a fully accurate transcription would require careful review.]

The handwriting is in cursive and while most of it is legible, some words are challenging to read with complete certainty. The text appears to be a personal account of a UFO or aerial sighting experience.
