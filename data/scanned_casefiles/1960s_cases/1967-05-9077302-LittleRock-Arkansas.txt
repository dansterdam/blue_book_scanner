The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "X" on the compass where you lost sight of the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Transcribed text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
I first sight of the object was at approximately 8:16 p.m. The object was traveling from the northeast to the southwest at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. It was a bright orange-red in color and oblong in shape. It seemed to be moving at a very rapid speed, much faster than any commercial aircraft I have ever seen. After approximately 3 or 4 minutes it disappeared from sight, apparently going behind some trees.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None, just a bright orange-red light
b. Color: Bright orange-red
c. Size: Oblong, approximately 1/4 the size of full moon

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 1/4 to 1/5 of the full moon, it seemed to be about 1/4 to 1/5 the size of the full moon.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch such details as you can recall, such as number of wings, tail, etc., and especially include a sketch of the vapor trails, if any. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: May 2, 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The sighting is definitely Unidentified. I was driving along the Sheridan Highway between Little Rock and Hot Springs, Arkansas around 10:00 on the night of January 30, 1967 when I noticed a bright object in the sky that did not appear to be an aircraft. The object was round or oval in shape and glowing in an orange-reddish color. It appeared to be hovering and making no sound, and was quite bright compared to the surrounding stars. After a minute or two, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. I've had a keen interest in astronomy for many years and am quite familiar with the appearance of regular aircraft, satellites, meteors, etc. This object did not resemble any of those celestial phenomena that I'm acquainted with. I am a responsible citizen and do not have a history of reporting unreliable information. I believe this sighting represents a genuine unidentified flying object.
