h. Significant Unusual Condition:
The unusually clear night almost positively accounted for the observers sighting of the Diamond Shoal Light Ship approximately 30 miles east of Ocracoke, SOL Powell, Assistant to the Duty Officer at Coast Guard District #5, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth, Virginia, confirmed the existence of the Diamond Shoal Light Ship at 35-05.3 North and 75-19.7 West. SOL Powell also stated that the Diamond Shoal Light Ship has a 16,000 candle power light which is mounted 66 feet above the water. This light is full bright for 21 seconds and dimmed for 12 seconds. It can normally be readily seen for 14 miles from the surface, and with the naked eye.

i. Interception or Identification Action Taken: None.

j. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Lockum, USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing (DOO-H), Langley AFB, Virginia. The description of the object sighted was given by B& R. O'Neal in the presence of EN2 L. T. Chamber, SN W. J. Barron, and SA R. W. Ferrell. EN2 O'Neal estimated the distance of the object to be greater than 20 miles. All statements seemed to confirm that the object sighted was the light on the Diamond Shoal Light Ship, except the red and green flashing lights. Such red and green lights are used as running lights on the Diamond Shoal, but are normally off as the ship is anchored. However, it is possible that they were on the night of 7 November 1965, and would be visible if the ship was headed toward the observers.

k. No physical evidence was reported to exist.

2. This sighting was reported to QM K. E. McFelsa at the Norfolk Rescue Coordination Center, who relayed it to AFSC (FTD), Wright-Patterson AFB and to the 4500 AB Wing Command Post, Langley AFB, Va.
