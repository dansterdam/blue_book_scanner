Dear Mr. [redacted]                                                Aug 31, 1962

A few days ago I received your

I will try to give some clarification
put. Following is a complete account
of the sighting -

On the night of Aug 22, 1962,
my patrol log (with details) will
bear out the following at the time. Here
with a few details on the sky just
at that time I was a night driver, on an
assignment of approximately 9:30 PM
driving south. I saw a bright shining
light in the sky. This will bear
looked like a light with (word) 
except for the fact that it did not
blinking or anything. We do not expect
at it through binoculars. Brightness
was as much stronger, as it did
look small. I observed it for
height in middle of flying complete

CLEVELAND PRESS - 23 AUGUST 1962

Our
Busy CITY
By HENRY GORDON

Balloon Mystery Solved (?)
A little more light was cast today on the identity of a mysterious object which startled anxious sky-watchers in eastern suburbs Tuesday night.

A Euclid woman reported that a neighbor man has been launching flares attached to four balloons at intervals for about a year. This explains the "muffled explosion."

"No one one up Monday night just before the storm," she said, "and another one Tuesday night. I don't know why."

His reason remains obscure. The balloonist was unavailable for comment today. Tune in tomorrow...

'Orange in Sky?
Best Guess Is
Weather Balloon
Best guess about the bright orange objects that were seen the last two nights crossing the sky above the eastern suburbs is that they were weather balloons.

An object was observed last night by hundreds of residents of Euclid, Richmond Heights, South Euclid, Mayfield Heights and Highland Heights from about 9:30 to 9:50, when it apparently burst. Most said it moved from northwest to southeast.

Cleveland Plain Dealer - 13 Aug 62

I was the first to sight this UFO from my front yard as it approached my vantage point from the southeastern horizon, traveling northwest at about 216th street. At first, but a few degrees to the west of it. This object had no form other than the somewhat round color which appeared to be an orange-red. Neither did it produce any sound or leave any visible trail. It appeared to be maintaining a five-minute altitude.

Before it approached us directly over head, it made a long sweeping arc eastward and its light slowly disappeared.

I have no way of estimating its altitude or its speed or size. Neither did it remind any of the four of us of anything we had ever seen before.

I trust that this provides you with the information requested.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Confirming our telephone conversation this morning, I am pleased to provide you with the following facts concerning an unidentified "flying object" observed last night by myself and three next door neighbors. Those neighbors are: [redacted]

Cleveland 23, Ohio (Euclid)

This sighting was made approximately between 9:00 and 9:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, Monday, August 20, 1962. The object was on a bearing 180 or 190.

I was the first to sight this UFO from my front yard as it approached my vantage point from the southern horizon, but a few degrees northwest of it. This object had no form other than to be a strange, orange-red, crane-like object that seemed to be maintaining a glow visible trail. It appeared to be maintaining a slow view. Total viewing time at least five minutes.

Before it approached us directly over head, it made a long sweeping arc eastward and its flight slowly disappeared.

I have no way of estimating its altitude or its speed, or else whether it rendered any one of the four or six of anything we had ever seen before.

I trust that this provides you with the information requested.

Yours sincerely,
[signature redacted]
