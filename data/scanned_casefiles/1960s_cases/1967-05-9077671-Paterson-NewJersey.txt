The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in Paterson, New Jersey on June 21, 1967.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:
This is an article involving us, in the Paterson Daily News Paper: "Two boys, 12 and 13 years old, relieved to be the first to spot a UFO shortly after 9 p.m. Wednesday night. Agnes Granger, a 12 year old grade student in St. Agnes Grammar School, called the news as soon as he returned home after viewing the strange object in the sky. He said the object hovered over Park Street, shortly after 9 p.m. when they spotted it. Another large, dim glowing object then appeared and moved about one minute in one spot and then moved rapidly until it disappeared from view."
There is something that was not mentioned in the article, that in the opinion of those close enough to the ground to hear a soft sort of noise, but there was none.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

Proposed reply to letter from ARC Charles Rogers, 11 May 1967

Dear Airman Rogers:

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for an individual to report his observation to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible. 

Your information will be filed for information purposes only. To date, there has been a total lack of tangible evidence to indicate our planet has or is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles. UFOs do exist; but in reports only.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force's UFO program.

Commanding Officer; Project Blue Book
Mr. Amdahl 
Regional Collecting Center
Detroit, Michigan 48033

Gentlemen,

I am writing a report concerning report # 220, submitted by myself. 

This report involves an incident which occurred over Paterson, New Jersey. The object I observed was moving at a very high rate of speed and seemed to be flying between my home and Dover City. 

The object I observed did not shine as a regular aircraft light. It seemed to have a dull orange color. It made no sound that I could hear and there was no trail of any kind. The object changed direction in the sky continuously and seemed to be under intelligent control. I was not able to identify the object and no aircraft or satellites were observed in the area at that time.

It seemed to be continuing for sometime with no change in movement than suddenly it disappeared.

I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding this incident.

Sincerely,

- page 14 -

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be handwritten text, possibly from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text reads:

"Several cars seem to be about at the same time, they apparently made no noise. There was no dust or disturbance of any kind.

There was no light, no vapor trail or anything to indicate the first about half a minute after I saw the object it seemed to disappear completely. This might of course, be only an illusion.

Incidentally, the intensity of the light was sufficient to allow me to glance off of toward the north, but I felt no heat or warmth whatsoever.

The object had been a stark white about as big as a softball and was motionless, remaining at about 30 degrees altitude all the way. I lost sight of them then after about a half minute. I happened to glance at my wrist watch and saw that he next exposure shot showed the strange lights and followed the first one quite rapidly. I watched them until they had gone."

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document which appears to be a letter or report.

Transcript of the text in the document:

"About a media before these I saw an object, party way below airborne, a few over flying southwest. It was  moving to the rim of formation.

This I saw above rather than straight down and it was there seen. Each was a single white light.

If the reason I was so long in contacting you was because it did not seem with certain so as to make a definitive report.

It thinks I save it to my country. I tell them that there is nothing in our sky that belong there.

Even duty is to your and nation mountain air so promptly acceptable.

The above is exactly gentlemen. I appreciate that get that you do not understand what we are to ignore until.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

MICHALAK EXCLUSIVE TO MARK-AGE
Page 2

What would be your thoughts if you saw two UFO's approach, then one of them land near you?
Would you do as Steve? He studied it for about 15 minutes, sketched it, then approached the craft.
Hearing voices, he tried to communicate in seven languages, but received only silence. He touched the ship, finding it hot. As it started to lift off, he was burned by the energy which empowered it.

The strange burns and other ill effects required his confinement in bed for a week, during which time he had still-undiagnosable symptoms of his encounter. On September 15th he had a one-day recurrence and hospitalization.

Put on November 1st he said, "Right now I feel quite good, physically and mentally." In his MAIN interview in his own home, Steve relates the initial experience and its following developments, giving his present attitude and thoughts about visitors from other planets.

Mark-Age Inform-Nations is inaugurating its radio and newspaper syndication departments with this exclusive interview on tape with Steve Michalak of Winnipeg, Canada. The half-hour radio presentation will be premiered on Frank Poynter's "Open Mike" show over WQAM, Miami Beach, Florida on November 15th, between 11 PM and 2 AM.

This program has been selected because of the reception its moderator and its audience have given to Mark and Yolanda, the co-directors of Mark-Age MetaCenter, Inc., parent organization of MAIN, during their six guest appearances on "Open Mike" since August 1, 1967.
"THE END"

ATTENTION:...RADIO...PROGRAM...DIRECTORS...&...EDITORS...

This dramatic tape recorded interview, with narration by Mark of Mark-Age, then will be made available as a syndicated, special feature program throughout the world. Newspaper syndication of the interview, which is transcribed, is now offered through MAIN, Mark-Age Inform-Nations, 327 N.E. 20 Terrace, Miami, Florida 33137. Thank you.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] postmarked June 22, 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your recent correspondence in which you reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in your area.

If the individuals wish to report their observations directly to the Air Force, they should contact the nearest Air Force Installation, which is Andrews AFB, Maryland.

Each Air Force base has a UFO investigator who gathers all pertinent information on the particular sighting. If he is unable to determine the stimulus, the information is sent to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for their evaluation and further investigation.

Your information will be filed for information purposes.

My wife and I have any knowledge of UOAs, but we believe strongly in seeing unexplained aerial phenomena. We did not know what this object was, but it made us very inquisitive and we would like to know more about UAPs and how to identify them. If this was not a legitimate object, then some sort of explanation would be appreciated.
