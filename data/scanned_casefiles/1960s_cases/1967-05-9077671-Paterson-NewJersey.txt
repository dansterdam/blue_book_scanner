Paterson, New Jersey
June 21, 1967

Dear Sir,
This is an article involving us, in the Paterson Daily News Paper:
"Two boys, residents of the South Paterson section of the city, spotted what they believed to be a UFO shortly after 9 p.m. Wednesday night when they arrived, 12, of St. Agnes Grammar School called the News as soon as he returned home after viewing the strange site."

13, of, were walking on Park Street, shortly after 9 p.m. when they spotted a rather large, dim object in the sky. He said the object had a red center and hovered about one minute in one spot and then moved rapidly until it disappeared from view.

We might add something that was not mentioned in the article, the object was close enough to the ground that a person would be able to hear some sort of noise, but there was none.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

Proposed reply to letter from A2C Charles Rogers, 11 May 1967

Dear Airman Rogers:

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for an individual to report his observation to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible.

Your information will be filed for information purposes only.

To date, there has been a total lack of tangible evidence to indicate our planet has or is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles. UFOs do exist; but in reports only.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force's UFO program.

Commanding Officer, Project Blue Book
Nat'l Technical Intelligence Center
Wright - Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio 45433

Gentlemen,

I am writing a report concerning several UFO's witnessed by myself and several others who were with me at different times.

The first and most prominent one was an object I saw flying between my home and Kansas City.

The object, when I first saw it, was about the size of a street light at a distance of one hundred yards away. Ohio time on the night of May 23, 1966. The object seemed to be shaped as follows. It was showing a dull orange-red. I watched it move at it went through a series of maneuvers, for approximately half an hour.

It seemed to be looking for something. It would hover, then descend to the horizon, hover,


- page 14 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

ascend and move south very slowly, then
repeat the maneuver.

Then it stopped for a few seconds
and seemed to be just about fifty
feet from the ground. This height,
of course, is only an estimate.

Suddenly the intensity of the
glow increased momentarily and
it flashed off toward the south, ascending at about a
30° angle to the ground.

But then where it had
stopped the appeared another
one who repeated the change in
light and followed the first. I
watched them until they had gone.

The night had been a dark
one, with no moon or clouds to be
seen anywhere. I observed them
from my bedroom through a pair
of 3X binoculars.

For about a week after, both
my family and I watched several
UFOs which were in those at
times flying at a very high altitude.


- page 15 -

About a week before this, I was at a party like a lake when three flew over flying southwest in what seemed to be an formation, like that. These were very high, and looked slighter than any star I've ever seen. Each was a single white light!

If the reason I was so long in contacting you was because I didn't have an address.

I am in the Air Force now and I think I owe it to my country to tell them that there is something in our skies that doesn't belong there.

Our duty is to govern and maintain air supremacy throughout the skies. But, gentlemen, I think we have lost that goal simply because we are ignorant to accept what we don't understand.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

MICHALAK EXCLUSIVE TO MARK-AGE                                     Page 2

What would be your thoughts if you saw two UFO's approach, then one of them land near you?
Would you do as Steve? He studied it for about 15 minutes, sketched it, then approached the craft.
Hearing voices, he tried to communicate in seven languages, but received only silence. He touched
the ship, finding it hot. As it started to lift off, he was burned by the energy which empowered it.

The strange burns and other ill effects required his confinement in bed for a week, during
which time he had still-undiagnosable symptoms of his encounter. On September 15th he had a
one-day recurrence and hospitalization.

But on November 1st he said, "Right now I feel quite good, physically and mentally." In
his MAIN interview in his own home, Steve relates the initial experience and its following de-
velopments, giving his present attitude and thoughts about visitors from other planets.

Mark-Age Inform-Nations is inaugurating its radio and newspaper syndication departments
with this exclusive interview on tape with Steve Michalak of Winnipeg, Canada. The half-hour
radio presentation will be premiered on Frank Poynter's "Open Mike" show over WQAM, Miami
Beach, Florida on November 15th, between 11 PM and 2 AM.

This program has been selected because of the reception its moderator and its audience have
given to Mark and Yolanda, the co-directors of Mark-Age MetaCenter, Inc., parent organization
of MAIN, during their six guest appearances on "Open Mike" since August 1, 1967.

"THE   END"

ATTENTION:   RADIO PROGRAM DIRECTORS  &   EDITORS

This dramatic tape recorded interview, with narration by Mark of Mark-Age, then will be
made available as a syndicated, special feature program throughout the world. Newspaper
syndication of the interview, which is transcribed, is now offered through MAIN, Mark-Age
Inform-Nations, 327 N.E. 20 Terrace, Miami, Florida 33137. Thank you.

Jens traveling in West - East direction as I saw a moving object in the sky. I pulled off the road to make sure that I was seeing right. When I got out of my car the object was stopped, moving slowly away from the object. I saw 2 red objects which looked like sauds dropped from a plane. Then the object started moving again in the same direction. Again as it was moving I noticed 2 red objects coming from it and disappearing. I then walked to a near-by gas station to tell other people what I was seeing. The object disappeared at this point.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] postmarked June 21, 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your recent correspondence in which you reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in your area.

If the individuals wish to report their observations directly to the Air Force they should contact the nearest Air Force installation which is Andrews AFB, Maryland.

Each Air Force base has a UFO investigator who gathers all pertinent information on the particular sightings. If he is unable to determine the stimulus, the information is sent to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for their evaluation and further investigation.

Your information will be filed for information purposes.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

It did not have any beacons or tail which a plane would have. The only way this UFO could possibly be solved is in my saying that it was a helicopter-plane, and this is not so. Because of the distance from me. If it was a helicopter some sort would have been heard. And after watching it for 2 minutes and 15 seconds it took off like a rocket.
