The text in the document reads as follows:

ASTRONOMY

Venus Shines Brilliantly

Venus, the most prominent object in the January sky, glows brightly in the southwest, outshining all other planets and many stars and is easily identified.

By JAMES STOKLEY

As the EARTH rotates this month, the planet Venus is a prominent object in our evening sky. Venus is like the bright headlights of a car that you can see from a distance, and it is easily identified.

Because Venus is a superior planet, it appears on the sky west of the Sun and sets after the Sun does. It is brightest in the northwest just after sunset. Right now it is shining so brightly that it can easily be seen for a half hour or more after the sky becomes dark.

In the next few days, Venus will be in a position to the south of the waxing crescent Moon, making a beautiful sight. The planet appears higher and brighter now than it will later in the month.

As the Earth rotates, Venus appears to shift its position among the stars. Early in the evening now, the planet is well up in the southwest. By the time darkness has fully fallen, it is in the west. And as the night passes, it sinks lower in the sky, setting in the west-northwest long after the Sun.

Three Other Planets Visible

In the evening sky in addition to Venus, three other planets are visible - Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. These are very soon after the stars first become visible in the east.

Saturn is to the southeast and Jupiter is the brightest object in that part of the sky at the end of December. Around January 5, the gaseous giant planet will reach opposition, when it is opposite the Sun in the sky.

But Saturn and Jupiter pale into insignificance compared to Venus. These are the three brightest objects in the sky after the Sun and Moon.

Mars, the reddish object, is farther east, near the constellation of Aquarius. It is visible from about 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

The main thing to observe now is Venus. This is the brilliant "evening star" of winter. It will become a "morning star" in the predawn sky by late spring. But for now it is a superb object in the early evening.

SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS

The text in the document reads as follows:

Trillianfly is a variable star, whose light intensity is known to fluctuate. The two major causes of the moon's varying brightness are described. The article discusses the number of eclipses that will be visible in 1965 and provides details about the dates and types of eclipses that will occur.

Celestial Time Table for January
This table lists the times of various astronomical events for the month of January, including the times of sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and the times of events related to the planet Venus.

Transcript of the document text:

Less damage z. apparently occurred - saucer shaped marks near the ends of the wing, the center portion of the wing appearing to be undamaged. No dent holes or punctures were observed. Marks on the ground indicated the object had landed at the location. 1330 gkm* observer aeroraft immediately s*nf to the scene but had difficulty locating the object due to mountainous terrain. Observer stated he flew over the area several times but could not sight the object again. No other details concerning the appearance of the object or its landing/take off were recorded. The location of the incident was approximateLy 2S 29' OON, 177 00' OW in the Pacific Ocean.

"UFO LANDING AT AIR FORCE BASE
Splitting Disc Seen in Arkansas

The following report is forwarded by the Commanding Officer of the Arkansas Headquarters of the Civil Air Patrol as a result of an interview with the observer at a point near Blytheville, Arkansas, on 7 January 1964.

On the evening of Tuesday, 7 January 1964, at approximately 7:55 p.m., CST, a Lt Col (Pilot) attached to the 97th Bomb Wing at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas, was returning to the base from a routine navigation training mission. He was familiar with the area, having been the instructor pilot on approximately 700 similar training flights.

As he approached the base at an altitude of approximately 1,500 feet, he noticed a strange object in the northern sky, which he described as "a bright, metallic, circular object, about 25-30 feet in diameter, with a red light centered in the lower portion of the object." He immediately notified the Blytheville AFB control tower of the object, and was informed that the object was also visible on the tower's radar scope.

The Lt Col made several rapid turns in an attempt to close the distance to the object, but it disappeared momentarily. It then reappeared and proceeded in a southeasterly direction at a high rate of speed, covering the distance of approximately 8 miles in about 4-5 seconds. The Lt Col stated that the object appeared to be hovering momentarily, and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate of speed. After it had disappeared from his view, he reported the incident to the base operations officer.

Further questioning revealed the following additional details:

1. The object was observed for approximately 4-5 minutes.
2. The object was sighted at an estimated altitude of 3,000-4,000 feet.
3. The object was described as bright metallic, circular in shape, approximately 25-30 feet in diameter, with a red light centered in the lower portion.
4. The object moved in a jerky, irregular manner, and at one point appeared to hover momentarily.
5. The object accelerated to a very high rate of speed in a southeasterly direction, covering approximately 8 miles in 4-5 seconds.
6. The object was clearly visible to the pilot, who was familiar with the area, and was also observed on the Blytheville AFB control tower radar scope.

The observer is considered to be a reliable and credible individual, with an extensive background in aviation. His report is forwarded for your information."
