ASTRONOMY
Venus Shines Brilliantly
Venus, the most prominent object in the January sky, glows brightly in the southwest outshining all other planets and stars and is easily identified.

By JAMES STOKLEY

> ALTHOUGH it is not quite in a position to be shown on our maps, the planet Venus is now the most prominent star after the sun.

In the east low, the lion, is coming into view, and here we find the star called Regulus, also so low the bright star Spica is dimmed.

On Jan. 14 there will be an eclipse of the sun, but the only people who will be able to see it easily will be the members of the various scientific parties in the Antarctic.

The region over which is will be visible covers Antarctica, the southern tip of South America, and just barely reaches Tasmania.

This is not a total eclipse of the sun. The one that occurred last July was visible in the United States. It will be partial, and where the eclipse is greatest, the coast of Enderby Land, only about 50% of the sun's diameter will be covered by the large disc of the moon.

It will be the first of six eclipses that will occur during 1964. Four of these will be visible from Australia and New Zealand well south of the equator. This time about 75% of the sun's diameter will be hidden where the eclipse is greatest.

The next, on July 6, will be visible over the Arctic regions, including parts of northern Canada, Greenland and Siberia. Then the maximum eclipse will only be about 25%. The next occurs on Dec. 3 and 4. It will be visible over northeastern North America and the northern Pacific Ocean.

Toward the southeast is the glow of prominent constellations that make the winter evening skies so brilliant. Perhaps the most conspicuous is Orion, the warrior. Betelgeuse is the brightest star in Orion.

A little lower is Canis Minor, the little dog. With the star Procyon, which is the brightest star in that constellation.

To the right is Gemini, the twins, with the stars Castor and Pollux.

Above and to the right of Orion is the star Aldebaran. Aldebaran marks the animal's eye. To the left is Gemini, the twins, with the stars Castor and Pollux.

This is mainly because it is quite close to us. Sirius is about 21 times as bright as the sun, but many stars are far more luminous.

Two other planets are in the sky after sunset. These are Mars, which sets a little after sunset, and Saturn, which follows a little later. Mercury will be to the west.

Around Jan. 20 you may be able to see it low in the east just before sunrise.

But now let us go from the planets to the stars of the January evening. These are shown on our map, which depicts the first appearance of the year 1941, 9:30 p.m. on the 15th and 8:20 p.m. on the 31st.

The document also includes two star charts showing the positions of various constellations and stars in the night sky.

At the bottom of the page, there is a note: "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS"

[Partial Text Visible]
Number of Eclipses Varies
Six is an unusually large number of eclipses for one year. The most common number is four, and there can be as few as two. To this case, both will be of the sun, but during one year—either five of the sun and two of the moon, or four of the sun and three of the moon. This will almost occur during 1964, since there was an eclipse of the moon on Dec. 30. Thus, in the 12 months between Christmas in 1963 and 1964 there are seven eclipses.

The last time there were seven eclipses in a calendar year was in 1935, with five of the sun and two of the moon. It will happen again in 1962, when solar eclipses will come on Jan. 25, June 21, July 20 and Dec. 15, and those of the moon on Jan. 9, July 6 and Dec. 30.

This information about future eclipses is by way of a very remarkable book: The Canon of Eclipses, which was published in 1857, the work of a Viennese astronomer, Ritter von Oppolzer. This book contains tables giving data about eclipses (5,000 solar and 5,200 lunar) occurring between Nov. 10, 1207 B.C. (Pharaoh Thutmose III, secondary) and Nov. 17, 2161 A.D. (Copernican Calendar). There are also 100 maps showing the approximate paths over which the total eclipse of the sun was visible. It is quite stable. The original Vienna edition of Oppolzer's Canon is now very rare, but in 1962 Dover Publications, Inc. issued a new edition, with an English translation of the German text.

I see a typewritten document with some text, but parts of the text are difficult to read clearly. At the top of the page, there are several horizontal black lines that appear to be redacting or obscuring some information. The text below these lines is partially legible, but I cannot confidently transcribe the entire document. Some words and phrases are discernible, but many are blurry or cut off. The document appears to be a report or statement of some kind, but without a clear, complete transcription.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Note: Some words are difficult to read due to the image quality, so I will transcribe as accurately as possible]

[First paragraph is mostly illegible, with only fragments of words visible]

... flying ... position ... with ... 

[Middle paragraphs are partially readable but contain many unclear words]

... could be ... observation ... that ... 

... with ... noted ... 

[Last paragraphs are similarly difficult to fully transcribe]

... would seem ... something ... just ... 

[At the bottom of the page, there appears to be a blacked-out section, likely redacting a name or identifying information]

The text is very faint and the image quality makes a complete, accurate OCR transcription challenging. Large portions of the text are illegible or only partially readable.

UFO LANDING AT AIR FORCE BASE

In Arkansas

[The rest of the text is partially cut off or obscured, but begins with a description of an event on Tuesday, January 28, 1964, involving observations of an object in the sky. The text continues with details about the sighting, but the full content is not completely legible due to the image quality and page layout.]

The header indicates this is from the APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) Bulletin, dated 28 January 1964, and the main article is about a UFO sighting in Arkansas, with a headline about a UFO landing at an Air Force Base.
