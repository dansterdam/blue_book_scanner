Dear Sir:

Enclosed you will find a copy of UFO sighting reported to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory through one of our Moonwatch affiliates.

Captain Thompson made his original report to H.W. Holt of the Denver Moonwatch team, and the report was subsequently forwarded to this office. We have taken no action other than acknowledging the report, preferring to leave any investigation to your organization.

Sincerely,

James C. Cornell Jr.
