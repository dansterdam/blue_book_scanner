The text from the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 March 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The night of March 9, 1966, while the object was hovering over our house, the lights in the house went off and the television set went off and on several times. The object was almost directly over us, and we could see lights on the underside of the object. The lights were very bright and seemed to be rotating. The object seemed to be almost circular in shape and as large as a house. The night was clear and we could see the object very plainly. We observed the object for about 10 minutes before it moved away in a Northeasterly direction and disappeared from view. We called the police station at Mena, Arkansas, but they said they had received no other reports of the object. We are sure this was not an airplane or helicopter, and it was not the moon or a star. The sighting was very unusual and we would be glad to answer any further questions you may have.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketched illustration with a compass rose and instructions for describing the motion of an object or objects. The text on the page describes the sketch and provides instructions for the viewer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which the object first appeared. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction in which the object last disappeared.
