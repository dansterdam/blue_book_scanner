PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 9 May 1966 08/0355z

2. LOCATION: [Partially illegible]

3. SOURCE: Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 35 Seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: [Blank]

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: UNIDENTIFIED

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object was 4th or 5th magnitude, white, point of light, stationary. The object was first sighted at 2 lights. It would move high at one end or slow little after moving to 3 lights. At the other end, object would fade in a steady manner after growing to 3 lights. The object would slowly fade.

Local airport was contacted (Mathis Field) and they had no record of any aircraft operating in the area that would explain the sighting. A radiosonde balloon had been in the area at 1825 but was not the source at the time of the sighting.

Conclusion: There is no definite explanation and the case is carried as UNIDENTIFIED.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
