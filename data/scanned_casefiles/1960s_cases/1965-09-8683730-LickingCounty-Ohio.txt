STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

At approximately 0235½, the Base operator at Lockbourne called the Control Tower stating that the Franklin County Sheriff's Office was on the phone and wanted to talk with us. The tower accepted the call.

The Franklin County Sheriff's Office advised the tower that a deputy from the Licking County Sheriff's Office had spotted a UFO traveling East then turned West, Red in color and traveling at a high rate of speed. The deputy's name and address as follows: Steve Goss, 46 S 3rd St., Newark, Ohio.

The UFO was reported as having no tail and gradually faded out.

The Tower observed a object east of the field. But the target was stationary, possibly a star. Aircraft 51074, C-47 was asked to make an identification of the object. The aircraft was unable to determine what the object was due to the amount of stars overhead.

At the SW end of Lockbourne AFB, the object headed west bound. At this time, A-51074, C-47 type aircraft was airborne and was asked to identify the object if possible. The aircraft Commander of A-51074 advised that he could not positively identify the object as an aircraft.

Detroit Air Defense Sector was tracking the object in conjunction with Lockbourne Tower.

After A-51074 made his identification, the subject turned NNW bound and gradually faded out.

All this information was passed to the Detroit Air Defense Sector and to Sgt Mears at the 317th Command Post at Lockbourne AFB.

STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

I observed a white circular object South of the Control Tower at a high altitude. I used the binoculars to track the object which traveled from the South to the North Northwest in an arc rather than a straight line. During the first sighting of the object it appeared to be a circular white object. When it was West of the Tower it appeared to be composed of two white circular lights. When the object was approximately North Northwest of the Control Tower it appeared to take up a constant heading to the North Northwest until it was no longer visible.

STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

at 0255 I observed a white object over the approach end of R/W 23 at an estimated 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon moving SSW. The object then made a circle around the base to the NNW where it faded out. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and was at an estimated 15 miles for the base. The object was under observation for about 5 minutes.

STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

I observed an UFO about 20-30 degrees above the horizon, white in color and traveling at a high rate of speed W. of Lockbourne. The object moved S.W. then made a right turn towards the West. Tracking with the glasses the UFO faded out N.W. of Lockbourne.

I observed no navigational lights, no grimes, "red", anticollision lights but it gave off an appearance of two bright white lights.

This information was passed to the proper authorities.

I swear this to be a true statement this 26th day September 1965.

STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

At approximately 0255, I observed a white round object east of
Lockbourne AFB heading SW. Once SW of Lockbourne, the object then turned
West bound. At this time, A-51074, a C-47 type aircraft, was asked to check the
object for possible identification.

I no longer observed the object due to the fact that I was working
at the local control position in the tower and this position required my
more immediate attention.
