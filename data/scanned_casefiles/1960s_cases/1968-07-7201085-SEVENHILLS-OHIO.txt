11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
THE OBSERVER SIGHTED A SILVER DISC SHAPED OBJECT THAT TRAVELED NORTH AND WAS SEEN FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS

COMMENTS: THE OBSERVER DOES NOT REALLY SAY OR INDICATE THE AGE OF SKY COVERED BUT ONLY SAYS THAT IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND A HOUSE. THE OBSERVER IS ONLY ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MILES FROM THE CLEVELAND HOPKINS AIRPORT. NO ONE REPORTED ANY SIMILAR SIGHTING TO THE SEVEN HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT. ALL THIS PLUS THE SHORT DURATION WOULD INDICATE THAN THE OBSERVER MAY HAVE SEEN THE REFLECTION OF SUNLIGHT FROM AN AIRCRAFT.
