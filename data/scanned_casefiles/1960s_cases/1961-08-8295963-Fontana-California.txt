3 photos received at ATIC of supposed flying saucer.

11. COMMENTS
Pictures sent to photo analysis. The object was small and photographed at close range. They were the result of long exposure outdoors or indoor exposures with the light from radically different angles, either of which would indicate the object being a flying saucer. Photo was a deliberate attempt to mislead the true identity of the object.

1. The attached photographs have been examined by the PND photoanalysis division who were unable to identify the object pictured.

2. The analysts concluded, however, that the object was small, being photographed at close range. They further concluded that the photographs resulted from either a long outdoor exposure or were indoor exposure due to the fact that the light apparently came from indirectly.

3. It is the analysts opinion that the photographs are a deliberate attempt to perpetrate a hoax.

2.  It is requested that the prints be forwarded to TD-DS upon com-
pletion of the analysis in order that they may be returned to the
witness.

3.  There is a suspense of 11 Sept 61 on this request.

TO:    TD-DS

1.  The subject photography has been examined but no
conclusion can be reached as to the identity of the
object.  However it appears to be a small dark photo-
graph at close range.

2.  On two of the photographs the light source was
apparently the same, while on the third image the light
came from a radically different angle.  This indicates
either a large passage of time out of doors, or indoor
photography, either of which would preclude a chance
encounter with a flying saucer.

Dear [redacted]:

I am returning the photographs which you sent to us recently.

The only conclusion reached was that the object photographed was small in size and photographed at close range. Focus was not fine and details are consequently limited.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,
