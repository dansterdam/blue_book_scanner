11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    The observer stated that he sighted and photographed a silver and gray flying object.

COMMENTS: There were no radar paints nor were there any other witnesses despite the fact that observer lists the duration as 10 - 15 minutes. There was also some clarifying in the background as the initial report was given over the telephone. Although the observer would not release the original photos, the object spoke very similar to a small suspended model or similar object.

UFO Report, 13 October 1968

1001 AB Wg (DORO)

1. Reference the attached unidentified flying object (UFO) report of 13 October 1968, on AF Form 117. The form was received in an envelope from your office without any comment. The report does not appear to have been investigated in accordance with AFR 80-17 and changes thereto. Request you investigate this report.

2. Page 9 of the completed Form indicates that the observer took photographs of the UFO. When submitting your report, please insure that you also include all data requested in paragraph 12a. A photographs, analysis cannot be performed without the original negatives; they will be returned to the owner upon completion of analysis.

3. We would appreciate comments from the preparing officer as to what a stimulus might have possibly caused the sightings. Also, in the comments section, it is helpful to our analysts if you would include those areas that you have checked, such as:

a. RADAR PERSONNEL - whether they had any identified or unidentified blips at the time of the observation.

b. CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL - statement as to whether the control tower operator observed anything unusual at the time of the observation.

c. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES - Often, they can provide information on the reliability of the witness. Also, they may have received a UFO report, or additional information that may provide you with the stimulus of the UFO observation.

It is important that you provide this information in your report so that our office does not duplicate your investigation.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

4. Please let me know what action you have taken on this report so that we may close out our file.

I apologize, but I cannot find any legible text in this image. The document appears to be a page from a UFO report with three photographs or images, but the text is too blurry or faded to read. The images themselves are also quite dark and grainy, making it difficult to discern their contents clearly.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:   DOBO/3415

SUBJECT:   UFO Report, 13 October 1968 (your ltr, 22 Nov 68)

TO:        TDPT (UFO)
            Wright-Patterson AFB
            Ohio 45433

1. Through an oversight, the enclosed photographs of the UFO were not forwarded with the AF Form 117. The photos were made with a Polaroid camera and the enclosed copies were made here since the sighter would not lend us the originals.

2. The sighting was investigated by the Base Operations Duty Officer thoroughly. There were no radar pickups nor were there any other witnesses. Although the reliability of the sighter is listed as unknown, there was some giggling in the background as the initial report was given over the telephone. The design of the "saucer" in the photo is similar to models the Base Operations Officer has seen constructed by local High School students.
