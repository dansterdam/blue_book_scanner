OCR output:
On the evening of Aug 18 a bright silver object was observed moving slowly across the sky from the north to the south. The object appeared to be approximately the same size as the full moon and was pulsating with a brilliant white light. At times the light seemed to flash or blink. The object was observed for several minutes and then disappeared from sight. 
It appeared to be very high in the sky, much higher than any aircraft I have ever seen. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I am quite puzzled as to what it could have been. I am a mature adult, not given to imagining things, and I am quite sure of what I saw. If you have any suggestions as to what this phenomenon could have been I would be most interested in knowing. 
The incident was observed by several other people in the area, including a Catholic priest and his housekeeper. All of the observers agree as to what was seen. I would be glad to furnish any further details that you may require. 
Sincerely,
Paul B. Johnson
Forestville, Connecticut

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
Dear Mrs. 
This is in reply to your letter to the Secretary of the Air Force regarding an observation of flares in connection with the power failure in the Forestville, Connecticut area.
The next time you make such an observation, it is suggested that you report it directly to Hanscom Field, Bedford, Massachusetts. They are able to take immediate action and investigate such reports. This local office would only be able to forward your report to them.
There is no correlation between the recent power failure and unidentified flying objects.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from the United States Air Force's Foreign Technology Division, addressed to Hq USAF SAFOIN (Mrs Hunt), regarding a request for UFO information.

The text in the document is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
REPLY TO: FDJSD/530
DEC 2 1965
SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOIN (Mrs Hunt)

This written to Defense Secretary McNamara for information as to the sources or sources who have been dropping flares in her area. It is suggested that she contact Bradley Field as Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the next time she sees the flares to be able to tell her which organization is dropping the flares. The recent power failure in the Northeastern was not caused by flying saucers nor was it associated with known sabotage.
