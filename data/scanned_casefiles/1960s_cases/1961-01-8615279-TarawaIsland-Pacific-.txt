11. COMMENTS
There were no satellites recorded at this time. Description and duration is characteristic of a meteor. There have been many reports of individuals sighting object very similar to this one, and they invariably turn out to be meteors connected with one or the many meteors showers that occur this time of year. Although the info reported is limited, it appears that the witnesses observed a meteor of the fireball class.
