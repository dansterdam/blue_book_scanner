The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project Blue Book record card from August 23, 1962, detailing an observation made in Newark, Ohio. The card contains various fields such as the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, course, length of observation, and a brief summary of the sighting. The summary notes that an overhead traveling almost due North disappeared just above the horizon and was observed as a steady light. The light did not change in brightness.
