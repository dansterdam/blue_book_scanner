27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document also contains a compass rose diagram and a curved line with angle measurements from 0° to 90°, with a silhouette of a person observing something on the horizon.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    3    Oct    1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I again sighted a similar object on Sep 8 1965 however the object was approximately 10° further North (more NNW) than the sighting on 6 Sep 65. The object, direction, weather etc. was identical to his sighting except the time was approx. 2115 hours. I again called Suffolk County AFB, was connected to The Tower (They said) but information regarding the sighting was not taken by the NCO in the tower.

It is my belief that what I saw on both occasions was a satellite. However, the satellite could not have been launched from Cape Kennedy because of the direction of travel. Reg[illegible] two programmers who work with me at Pan Am have recently been transferred from Pan Davis' Guided Missile Range Division (Pan Am handles down-range tracking) and they verified that unless direction was radically changed by 130° this satellite could not have been launched at the Cape.

However, we could not rule out launchings from Virginia, Vanderbilt AFB, Calif. or the USSR.


- page 7 -

Here is the text from the document:

30. (Contd.)
The object was too bright, too large (about the size of a watch head at arm's length) and much too fast to be the navigational lights of an aircraft. The object travelled through 135° in 3 or 4 minutes.

Spotted at A, disappeared at the horizon.

The sighting was unrelated - not one of so hard (at that time) heard of satellites/UFOs.
We were just mystified and speculative for many days.

The document also contains a simple hand-drawn diagram showing an arc or curved line with points marked A and an arrow indicating movement.

ATTN OF: TDEM/UFO
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Cloverdale, Ohio

To: Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying
object sighting by Mr. [redacted] Avenue, Long Beach, New York. The sighting
was made while satellite observation with the exception of the reported direction. There
are no known satellite orbital data retrogade orbit. The satellite
Echo II was over Long Beach, New York at the exact time
Mr. [redacted] made his observation. It passed to the north of the
city at 44 degrees above the horizon moving northwest. If there
was an error in the reported direction, then the object was
undoubtedly Echo II. If the direction reported by Mr. [redacted]
is correct, then it is likely that a high-flying aircraft was
the cause of the sighting.

There was a sighting over Long Beach, New York at the exact time known in the city at 41 degrees above the horizon moving northeast. If there was an error in the reported direction, then the object was undoubtedly Echo II. If the direction reported by Mr. was correct, then the object was a bright flying object.

Wash D C 20330

Reference the attached UFO report from Mr. [redacted], East Setauket, New York, of an unidentified flying object on the night of 6 September 1965.

The sighting consisted with the passage of satellite Echo III, which was 40 degrees above the horizon to the north of the city traveling in a northeast direction. Pertie movement of satellite are attributed to an illusion caused by atmospheric conditions and the passage of the satellite near bright stars or planets.

Sir:

I have tried to answer all questions clearly, concisely and completely. However, there has been a time lapse of one month and the only way I lacking. The information was by means of notes I took at the time. But will include some corrections made to the times. The date was 6 Sep 65 not 5 Sep 65 - because it was the evening of Labor Day - Monday evening.

My very best regards,

P.S. Your letter has extracts made but "remarks" are the same! Does the free word programmer be their Electronic Data Processing systems?
