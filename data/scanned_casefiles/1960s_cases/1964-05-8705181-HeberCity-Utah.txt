BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS

June 5, 1964

Dear Mr. ■■■■■■■

Thank you for submitting the U.S. Air Force Technical Information sheet for evaluation. Your observation has been evaluated as Echo 11, which was in your vicinity on May 16, 1964 at 4:55 a.m. in the east and moving northeast.

We are unable to evaluate your sighting of May 18, 1964. It may have been a high-flying aircraft, however, this is just a supposition.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

ATTN OF: OOBB

5 JUN 1964

SUBJECT: Intelligence Information, Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) BBP 64-333-354

TO: AFSC
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. A report of a UFO sighting was received by the Security & Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah at 0200Z hours, 17 May 1964.

2. Page: 19 years, Suffner, Florida, telephonically informed John R. McNeil, Investigator, Operations Branch, Security & Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah, that he observed an unidentified object about 30 miles east, southeast of Heber City, Utah, at about 003OZ hours, 17 May 1964.

3. advised that he is self employed as a truck driver and at the above time was proceeding along US Highway 40 for Heber City. He further advised that he has been so employed for about two weeks and prior to this employment worked as a cook for Morrison Catering Service, Tampa, Florida. He said that he had been separated from the US Coast Guard on 9 May 1963.

4. At a location approximately 30 miles east, southeast of Heber City, Utah, Mitchell related that he observed an object, navy gray in color, circling a mountain at about 1,000 feet elevation. The object appeared round and somewhat flat, the approximate size of a railroad car. The edges of the object glowed as if covered a phosphorous coating. The observed only one object and after it had circled the mountain, rose to an elevation of about 1,500 feet, went over a mountain sway from his point of observation, and disappeared. It emitted a sound similar to that of a jet engine in the process of starting and as the object disappeared, the sound decreased.

5. Mr Linsey Crock, 518 South 1st West, Heber City, Utah, who is employed as a Weather Observer, advised telephonically that during the period of 0100Z through 0300Z hours, 17 May 1964, the temperature was 34 degrees, visibility was clear with high scattered clouds. There was a southwest wind at 20 mph and no precipitation.

6. The preparing Officer is a General Investigator, GS-9, in the Security and Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah. There is no preliminary analysis of the reporting individual. Mitchell is convinced that he observed an illuminated object. There were no known experimental aircraft or missiles firing in the area at the time of this sighting. There were no other reports of a similar sighting in the area during this reporting period.
