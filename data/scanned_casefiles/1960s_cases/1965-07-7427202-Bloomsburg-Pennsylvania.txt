Dear Miss

In returning the clipping on the Antarctic Observations and the related news items, I am including a statement by Hugo Werdnando, an astronomer, of an astronomical observatory in Chile, who regarded the objects as a refraction of an astronomical kind. The United States Air Force has no authority to investigate reports from other countries, and incidents such as this are not included in Project Blue Book files.

Several important bits of data were missing from your letter regarding your observation of 4 July 1965. I have requested that you will out the attached FED Form 164 in order that we can make a proper report on this sighting.

I am attaching a report on Project Blue Book which will explain the Air Force progress on this program to date.

July 12, 1965

Dear Sirs:

Sunday night July 4, 1965 at approximately 9:30 P.M. my cousin and I saw an unidentified flying object in the sky. I was visiting my cousin who lives in Arlington Mass. when this occurred. At the time we had been casually observing the eastern sky when I spotted the object. I was looking through the telescope when I called my attention to the moving object in the sky. Before we saw the object start to move it had been completely stationary, forming with 4 other stars an acute isosceles triangle. Then it sped up rapidly and it appeared to be traveling at approximately 50 thousand miles an hour. It appeared to be moving through the sky about three times faster than our own satellites such as Echo-I which I observed earlier. This object which was in the eastern sky, began moving

We are returning the clipping on the Antartic observations

Five days after this experience I noticed in the Boston Herald an article on flying saucers. It stated that scientists at two Antarctic bases sighted a lens-shaped object in the sky whose behavior and maneuvering abilities were very similar to the object that we had sighted. This same object was sighted at a base in Chile and Buenos Aires on Saturday July 3rd. We saw it on Sunday July 4th. Scientific officials verified the story of the objects that were sighted at these bases. I have enclosed the article. Please mail it back to me with your reply because I would like to have it. We would appreciate it if you would write back and comment on this and give us all the information possible on the subject.

downward in a diagonal line towards the south. After moving for about two or three minutes it slowed down gradually and then came to a complete stop. It remained motionless for about twenty seconds. Then it began to travel again making a 90 degree turn towards the north. It then disappeared over the eastern horizon. Throughout this event the object was bluish green except for a few seconds when it appeared to get lighter.

We called the office of the U.F.O. (unidentified flying objects) and asked if there was an earth-made satellite visible at 9:30 on that evening. They said that only Echo I was visible, but at a different time - 10:30. They also said that this object could not have been an airplane if it was maneuvering the way we had described it and if it also came to a complete stop. With out a doubt this object had maneuvering abilities that were utterly fantastic.

TWO ANTARCTIC BASES SIGHT 'FLYING SAUCER'

SANTIAGO, Chile—From the Antarctic Tuesday came official reports that a mysterious lens-shaped flying object, measuring and moving at great speed, was sighted last Saturday.

A Chilean base commander in the Antarctic reported that the object was "yellowish red," changing to green, yellow and orange.

In Buenos Aires, the navy issued a communique saying that personnel at Argentina's Antarctic base saw the flying object and photographed it.

Mario John Berzosa, commander of the Chilean base, told the defense ministry he was too much of a rationalist to say a flying saucer or one of these scientific things.

"However," he continued, "it was something real, an object that moved at amazing speed, maneuvered quickly and gave off a blue-green sheet. It also caused interference in the electronic magnetic apparatus of an Argentine base which is facing ours on a nearby small island."

The interference was confirmed by the navy communique issued in Buenos Aires.

The object was yellowish red, John said, "changing to green, yellow and orange. It would zigzag quickly. Then it stopped and we promptly reached for field glasses, telescopes, anything at hand to sight it. We watched as it remained quite there for about 20 minutes."

John said that a corporal took color pictures, but that there are no facilities for developing the film. The men must wait for eight months to be relieved to have the film developed on the mainland.

Dear President Johnson,

Sunday night when I was out in my yard, I saw a flying object which was bright and had a flashing light in the back. It was not an airplane and not a meteor because of the flashing light. I thought it was a flying saucer. I only saw it for a few minutes.

Monday night on the 11:00 P.M. news, it was reported that a flying saucer was spotted over a Portuguese village and another place that I cannot recall. It had "an intermittently luminous white light" like I had seen.

I just wanted to tell you. I am 11 years old.

Yours truly,

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I have a more inclusive report of object sighted on July 4. The object was not an earth-made satellite. I am sure because I have seen Echo I in the sky and it was moving so slow I had to compare it to human to see if it was moving. No object of earth origin can stop in mid-space without plunging into atmosphere and burning up. I was told by a radio report that Echo II was going to be visible and where and when. This thing gave off a blue sheen, was a fantastic sight. I have since heard many reports on radio from people about a very similar occurrence. Please contact me if you find something.

Dear [redacted],

The President has asked that I reply to your recent letter regarding "flying saucers."

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the skies over the United States is the responsibility of the Air Forces. The name of this project is Blue Book.

In 18 years of investigating over 9000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved almost conclusively that reported serial phenomena have been objects either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies of the residue of meteoric activity.

There has never been any evidence that UFOs reported to the Air Force represented extraterrestrial vehicles. No such object reported to the Air Force has given any indication of a threat to the United States nor has any evidence been presented that any unidentified flying object exhibited characteristics beyond the scope of current technical or scientific knowledge.

I am enclosing a copy of PTO Form 164 which is used for making reports of this nature to the Air Force. This form should be completed as fully as possible and returned to the following address so that an evaluation can be made of your sighting:

Hq USAF (SAFCIC)
Washington, DC, 20330

Sincerely,
