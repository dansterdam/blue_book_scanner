OF COLFAX FIRST SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT AS HE WAS TRAVELL-
ING IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION DOWN LOUISIANA ROUTE NO 8. ALTHOUGH
IN THE INITIAL REPORT [REDACTED] WAS CITED AS SEEING AN OBJECT
MOVING NORTHWARD. THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM DISCLOSED THAT HE REALLY
SAW AN OBJECT FLYING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. FURTHER IT IS IM-
PORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE UFO WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE
ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE WHICH WAS ABOUT 8 MILES SOUTH OF HIS POS-
ITION. IT SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT ACTIVITY AT THE BASE MAY HAVE BEEN
RESPONSIBLE. AT THE TIME THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL HAZE IN THE ATMOS-
PHERE WHICH HAD A TENDENCY TO DISTORT THE SIZE OF LIGHTS. A POS-
SIBLE EXPLANATION COULD HAVE BEEN THE BEACON OPERATING AT THE
BASE. ALL THE REST OF THE REPORTS STEMMED FROM [REDACTED]
POLICE RADIO BROADCAST. OBSERVER "B", [REDACTED] REPORTED, BUT
IN AN INTERVIEW THE FOLLOWING DAY [REDACTED] CHANGED HIS MIND STATING
THAT WHAT HE REALLY SAW WAS THE MOON BEHIND THE TREES. HE ADDED
THAT HIS ORIGINAL OBSERVATION WAS CAUSED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF
[REDACTED] RADIO REPORT.
THIS LEAVES THE SIGHTING BY [REDACTED] (OBSER-
VER "D") AND [REDACTED] (OBSERVER "E") WHO WERE RIDING TOGETHER IN A

CAR NEAR LEESVILLE, LA. AN INTERVIEW WITH

WHO SPOKE FOR                 AS WELL, DISCLOSED THAT THEIR
SIGHTING WAS ALSO THE RESULT OF                 RADIO CALL. THE
DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT WHICH THEY SAW (LARGER AND BRIGHTER THAN
THE LARGEST AND BRIGHTEST STAR) AND ITS COURSE (NORTHWEST INDICATE
THAT IT PROBABLY WAS A DIFFERENT OBJECT THAN THAT SIGHTED BY
                    . THE SIZE AND FLIGHTLINE (STRAIGHT TOWARD THE
NORTHWEST) INDICATE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A JET WITH THE AFTER-
BURNER ON.

The image appears to be a heavily gridded document with very low legibility. Most of the text is too faint or blurry to read clearly. The document seems to be a form or data sheet with a grid pattern covering most of the page, with some darker grid lines on the left side and bottom of the page. However, I cannot make out specific text or details due to the poor image quality.


- page 5 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a grid or table-like document with very faint and blurry text that cannot be reliably read. The document is a black and white scan with significant degradation and darkness along the left margin.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a grid or table-like document with very faint and blurry text that cannot be reliably read.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document.

However, I cannot confidently read or transcribe any specific text from this image.


- page 9 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a grid or form with vertical and horizontal lines, but the text within the grid is too faint or blurry to be read accurately.


- page 10 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a heavily degraded grid or table document where the text is almost entirely illegible. The page consists of a grid-like pattern with faint lines and text that is too blurry and low contrast to be read accurately. The document seems to be an old, poorly preserved or scanned record with significant image quality issues.

The document is in black and white and seems to be a densely formatted page with multiple rows and columns.


- page 13 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low-quality, faded grid or form document where the text is almost entirely illegible. The page looks like a scanned document with a grid pattern, but no clear text can be discerned from this image.

The image appears to be a scanned document with a grid-like structure, but the text is largely illegible due to poor image quality, low contrast, and scanning artifacts. Most of the text is too blurry or faint to be accurately transcribed.


- page 17 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very faint grid or graph paper document with extremely low contrast and legibility. While there are vertical and horizontal lines forming a grid pattern, I cannot discern any readable text from this image. The document seems to be a scanned page that is very light and washed out, making OCR extraction impossible.

Most of the text on this page is too faint or blurry to be reliably read. The document appears to be a grid or table-like document with very light, almost illegible text.
