HIS INITIAL REPORT CITED AS SEEING AN OBJECT MOVING NORTHWARD, THE INTERVIEW WITH HIM DISCLOSED THAT HE REALLY
SAW AN OBJECT FLYING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. FURTHER IT IS IM-
PORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE UFO WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE
ENGLAND AIR FORCE BASE WHICH WAS ABOUT 8 MILES SOUTH OF HIS PO-
SITION. IT SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT ACTIVITY AT THE BASE MAY HAVE BEEN
UNUSUAL, AT THE TIME THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL HAZE IN THE ATMOS-
PHERE WHICH HAD A TENDENCY TO DISTORT THE SIZE OF LIGHTS. A POS-
SIBLE EXPLANATION COULD BE THAT THE BEACON OPERATING AT THE 
BASE CAUSED THE BEST OF THE REPORTS STEMMED FROM A POLICE RADIO BROADCAST. OBSERVER "D" AND
COLFAX ORIGINALLY REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT, BUT IN AN INTERVIEW THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CHANGED HIS MIND STATING
THAT WHAT HE REALLY SAW WAS THE MOON BEHIND THE TREES. HE ADDED

DATE OF REPORT 8 May 1962
LOCATION Marks ville, Leesville, Colfax, Louisiana
DATE/TIME GROUP 6 May 1962/2000Z

DETAILS OF INCIDENT:
On 6 May 1962 at approximately 2000Z, several sightings of unidentified flying objects were reported in the Marks ville, Leesville, Colfax, Louisiana area. The sightings were made by multiple witnesses, including civilian and law enforcement personnel.

The objects were described as bright, metallic, elliptical shapes that maneuvered at high speeds and made abrupt changes in direction. The objects were observed for extended periods of time, with some sightings lasting over an hour.

No physical evidence or residue was recovered from the sighting locations. Air Force personnel conducted interviews with the witnesses and performed field investigations, but were unable to determine the nature or origin of the objects.

The case remains unresolved and is classified as an unidentified flying object.

A round, disc-shaped object, about 60 feet in diameter, was seen by a number of people in the vicinity of Marksville, Leesville, and Colfax, Louisiana. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes as it hovered and maneuvered at a low altitude, estimated to be about 500 feet. Witnesses described the object as silver or metallic in color, with a row of steady burning lights around the rim. It was observed to make a number of abrupt turns and changes in altitude before finally accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight toward the south-southwest.

2. Date of Report: 5-10-62
3. Time: 5:53 p.m.
4. Duration: approximately 20 minutes
5. Description and Location:
Three persons, Mrs. X, Mrs. Y, and Mrs. Z, were standing in their front yard in Marksville, Louisiana, when they observed a bright metallic object in the sky to the east. It was shining brightly and was stationary. After about 5 to 10 minutes the object began to move very rapidly to the south and disappeared. The object was about the size of a full moon. The three witnesses were interviewed, and statements were obtained from them.
6. Weather at Time of Incident: Clear, visibility 50 miles.
7. Investigator's Comments: This appears to be a legitimate sighting. The explanation for the high velocity and disappearance of the object was that it may have been a satellite or meteor, although it was very unusual in its behavior.

May 8, 1962

The following information was received from COLONEL GEORGE EWING, USAF (Ret.),
20 South 4th Street, Leesville, Louisiana.

On May 8, 1962, COLONEL EWING received a telephone call from MAJOR FRED
M. HALL, USAF, stationed at England AFB, Alexandria, Louisiana. MAJOR HALL
stated that he had just received a call from SERGEANT ROBERT MOSCHEL, USAF,
stationed at Barksdale AFB, Shreveport, Louisiana. SERGEANT MOSCHEL informed
MAJOR HALL that he had observed a UFO over the area of Marksville, Leesville,
and Colfax, Louisiana on May 8, 1962 at approximately 1030 hours.

SERGEANT MOSCHEL stated that while on routine patrol, he observed a brightly
lit object, circular in shape, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. The
object was observed for approximately 10 minutes and was moving in a northerly
direction at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph. SERGEANT MOSCHEL further
stated that the object appeared to have a metallic outer shell and was giving
off a bright, bluish-white light.

MAJOR HALL in turn contacted COLONEL EWING and requested that he attempt
to obtain further information regarding the sighting. COLONEL EWING stated
that he would make every effort to gather additional details and would report
his findings to MAJOR HALL.
