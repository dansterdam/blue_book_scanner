11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object moved from North to South in sight for 30-60 seconds. Object appeared rounded, disc-like and oscillated up and down. Object disappeared. Picture of object (drawing) included with report. COMMENTS: The report does not accord with duration. Likely that this is the result of a natural phenomenon and not an unusual aerial object. As no physical evidence is available, this case can not be stated of further evaluation. This case was reviewed in November 1964.

1. We have received a report of an unidentified flying object from Wantagh, New York dated 6 Nov 61. 

2. The sighting of May 61 to which they refer is too old to warrant an investigation. In all probability the object was an aircraft of some sort. It is suggested that a Fact Sheet be included with the Air Force's reply.

Dear Sir:
I have just finished reading "The Report" on the unidentified flying object by the former head of Project Blue Book, Edward J. Ruppelt. My friend (Charles Ambrogi) and I were always interested in U.F.O.'s.
I am writing this in behalf of my curiosity about what we have definitely ascertained as facts about the existence of these objects and what the scientific community is now doing to try to solve this mystery. Since the existence of these objects has been established beyond reasonable doubt, I think we are entitled to know.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

We are late 15 year old. Do you head ya mention that you needed sightings that are in a great detail. My friend on May 9, 1961, made a observation in the sky. It was about 5 minutes long. That's about it for matter.

Sometimes in May 1961, I can't remember the day, I saw an U.F.O. It was about 3.55 and I was standing at the intersection at Wantagh avenue and South Drive. It was a bright round object traveling from the north to the south. It had a white stripe running from the nose to the back. It also had shot appeared to be 3 little lights mounted on the underside. I saw the object for about 20 to 30 seconds traveling north to south. It was going pretty fast and then it climbed rapidly steadily then it disappeared. I couldn't believe my eyes, it wasn't straight up and it disappeared. It might, I am enclosing a drawing of the object which I hope will help you in your investigation.

The sketch shows an elongated, triangular-shaped form with multiple distinct features resembling windows or apertures. The text "underside" is written below the sketch, suggesting this may be a sketch or illustration of the underside or bottom portion of the object.
