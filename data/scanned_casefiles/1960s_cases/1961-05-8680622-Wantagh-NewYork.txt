1.   We have received a report of an unidentified flying object
from    Wantagh, New York dated 6 Nov 64.

2.   The sighting of May 61 to which they refer is too old to
warrant an investigation.  In all probability the object was an
aircraft of some sort.  It is suggested that a Fact Sheet be
included with the Air Force's reply.

Dear Sirs:

I have just finished reading "the Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" by the former head of Project Blue Book Edward J. Ruppelt. My friend Charles Ambrose (?) and I were always interested in U.F.O.'s.

I am writing this on behalf of my friend ████████. Until now I didn't not know the existence of your research group. This is why I did not write to early(?).

We are both 15 years old. In your book you mention that you needed sighting that are in great detail. My friend in May, 1961 made such a sighting. I'll let my friend write about it now.

Sometimes in May 1961, I can't remember the day, I saw an U.F.O. It was about 3:35 and I was standing at the intersection of Wantagh Avenue and I saw a drive. It was a delta wing so I crept and it had a red and 3 white stripes running from the nose to the back. It also had what appeared to be 3 blue lights mounted on its underside. I saw the craft for about 20 to 30 seconds. Traveling north to south. It was going pretty fast and then it slowed down and finally stopped in mid air.

Then I couldn't believe my eyes, it went straight up and I disappeared because it height. I am enclosing a drawing of the craft which I hope will help you in your investigation.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of a triangular or pyramidal shape with two tall, textured vertical forms and four circular shapes (two on each side). The sketch is drawn within a bordered frame.
