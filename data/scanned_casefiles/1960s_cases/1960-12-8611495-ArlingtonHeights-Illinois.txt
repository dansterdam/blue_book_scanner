Object was in view for 1-2 min over a highly populated area, but was apparently observed by only one person. There was light air traffic in the area. There was a 9000' ceiling with complete overcast. It is possible that the object observed was one of the a/c in the area, but due to the lack of corroborating witnesses, there is insufficient data, precluding a conclusion.
