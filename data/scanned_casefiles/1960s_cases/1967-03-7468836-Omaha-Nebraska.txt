PROJECT 10/73 RECORD
1. TIME GROUP 20.25 - 27 31/010
2. LOCATION Omaha, Nebraska
10. CONCLUSION - The objects observed appeared to be inorganic and opaque forms of silver gray color (INORGANIC AND OPAQUE FORMS OF SIMILAR) 
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS - Observer reported objects fell to the ground. The objects were extremely hot when they landed and one or more of them disintegrated on impact. It appears that ample results were obtained from the objects observed.

TEST/UFO(M-3 H Quintanilla, Jr/70315/MS/16May) 17 May 1967

UFO Specimen, 30 March 1967

3902nd Air Base Wing
Attn: BCJ/Lt Sisk

1. Reference your recent letter regarding the physical specimen found 30 March 1967 by I Lt J H Sisk (30-310). The fused mass in the center was glassy or crystalline in nature. The exterior showed the material to be inorganic and impure formation. The outside was irregular in shape and contained many air bubbles. It appears the sample was formed by a rapid solidification process.

2. It appears the samples received from the contact of a high voltage wire and sand; however, your letter indicated this was not the case.

3. Request you inform me if any further analysis of our findings. There is no indication the specimen were of extraterrestrial origin.

EVALUATION REPORT
UFO SAMPLE

REPORT NR: MAY 67-3
PROJECT NR: 60102102
MANUFACTURE: XXX
SUBMITTED BY: ED/UFO (Lt. F. Marley, Jr.)

I. PURPOSE:
Analysis to aid in identification of sample material.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The sample material received (Analytical Branch #7-814) with indications that the inside had been subjected to immense heat, did not detect any significant elemental differences other than carbon concentration contained approximately 0.15% copper which is about normal for this type of material.
2. Spectrographic analysis of the outside material and the did not detect any significant elemental differences other than on both analysis the concentration of the outside material was approximately 0.005%. The following data was obtained:

Principal  Si
B-106      Fe & Al
1-5%       Ca, K & Na 
0.1-2%     Mg & Ti
<0.1%      All other metals

3. X-ray diffraction of the dark fused portion showed only near-white amorphous portion was also 10-20%. The fused mass in excess glass or crystallinephase.
4. Infrared absorption spectra of the outside and inside portions of the material to be inorganic and impure. The outside crystalline in nature while the inside was an impure fused glassy material.

There is no photograph present in this scanned document from Project Blue Book. The image appears to be a typed report from the Department of the Air Force regarding an unidentified substance found by Mr. Morgan in Omaha, Nebraska on March 30, 1967.

ATTN OF: BOXI (Lt. Sisk/294-4050) 10 April

SUBJECT: Unidentified Substance

TO: FTD (DET/UFO) 
Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio

1. The enclosed unidentified substance was found by Mr. Morgan, Omaha, Nebraska, on 30 March 1967. According to Mr. Morgan, he found the particles after they had recently fallen in his backyard between 1800 and 1950 hours CST. He also placed one piece that fell on his driveway concrete. The particles were extremely light in weight, resembling ash in appearance. The bulk of the particles were found scattered in the yard and one piece that fell on his concrete driveway.

2. Mr. S. B. K. plant guard for Allied Chemical Corp., LANL, took the particles to his office and turned them over to the OPPD (Omaha Public Power District). OPPD told him that they were not from their power lines.

3. On the evening of 30 March 1967, the particles were brought to our office to order to obtain a scientific analysis.

After talking to your office, we attempted to contact Mr. Morgan for a first-hand account of the incident. He was on a job and very difficult to contact. He stated that Morgan is approximately 50 years old and very stable and cooperative. According to Scheslihhofer, he was not interested in publicity, did not object to the objects being turned over to us for analysis, but would be interested in the results of the Air Force investigation.

a. Telephone Number for Morgan: 346-3087 - Area Code 402
b. Address and Telephone Number for: [redacted]
