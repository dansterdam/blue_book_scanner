11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported objects fell to the ground in his yard. The objects were extremely hot when they landed. Several pieces were below the surface of the ground about 2 or 3 inches. The objects had scorched the grass in the yard and one piece fell on the cement.
It appears the samples resulted from the contact of a high voltage wire and sand.

1. Reference your recent letter regarding the physical specimens found by a Mr [illegible] ray diffraction of the dark unused portion showed only < -Si02. A near-white unreacted portion was also < -Si02. The fused mass in the center was glassy or "amorphous" in nature. Infrared absorption spectra of the outside and inside portions showed the material to be inorganic and impure forms of silica. The outside was more crystalline in nature while the inside was an impure fused quartz glass.

2. It appears the samples resulted from the contact of a high voltage wire and sand; however, your letter indicated this unlikely.

3. Request you inform Mr [illegible] of our findings. There is nothing to indicate the specimens were of extraterrestrial origin.

MANUFACTURER: XXX                                       SPEC NR:
SUBMITTED BY: TDET/UFO (Lt. F. Marley, Jr.)             ITEM SERIAL NR:

I.   PURPOSE:
     Analysis to aid in identification of sample material.

II.  FACTUAL DATA:
     1. The sample material received (Analytical Branch #7-814) was cylindrical
     with indication that the inside had been subjected to immense heat.

     2. Spectrographic analysis of the outside material and the fused center
     did not detect any significant elemental differences other than copper. A sample
     taken near the center contained approximately 0.1% copper while the copper content
     of the outside material was approximately 0.005%. The following data was obtained
     on both areas:

                    Principal             Si
                    5-10%                 Fe & Al
                    1-5%                  Ca, K & Na
                    0.1-2%                Mg & Ti
                    <0.1%                 All other metals

     3. X-ray diffraction of the dark unfused portion showed only A-SiO2. A
     near-white unreacted portion was also A-SiO2. The fused mass in the center was
     glassy or "amorphous" in nature.

     4. Infrared absorption spectra of the outside and inside portions showed
     the material to be inorganic and impure forms of silica. The outside was more
     crystalline in nature while the inside was an impure fused quartz glass.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: BCXI (Lt. Sisk/294-4050)                                   10 April 1967

SUBJECT: Unidentified Substance

TO:   FTD (TDET/UFO)
       Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio

1. The enclosed unidentified substance was found by Mr. [redacted] in Omaha, Nebraska, on 30 March 1967. According to Mr. Morgan, he found these particles after they had fallen into his yard between 1800 and 1900 hours CST. He also stated that they were extremely hot when they landed because several pieces were below the surface of the ground about 2 or 3 inches. They had scorched the grass in the yard and one piece that fell on his concrete driveway scorched the cement.

2. Mr. [redacted], plant guard for Allied Chemical Corp., LaPlatte, Neb., took the particles to his office and turned them over to Mr. [redacted]. He contacted Omaha Public Power to find out if the particles were some type insulation from power lines. OPPD told him that they were not from their power lines.

3. On the evening of 30 March 1967 Mr. [redacted] brought these particles to our office to see if we would like to conduct a chemical analysis.

4. After talking to your office, we attempted to contact Mr. [redacted] for a first-hand account of the incident. He was on a leave of absence from his job, so all details mentioned above were reported by Mr. Scheilbhofer. He stated that Morgan is approximately 50 years of age and very stable and cooperative. According to Scheilbhofer, Morgan is not interested in publicity, did not object to the objects being turned over to us for analysis, but would be interested in the results of the Air Force investigation.

5. Additional Information:
   a. Telephone Number for Morgan: 346-3087 - Area Code 402.
   b. Address and Telephone Number for [redacted]

The image shows an older individual wearing glasses and a uniform or jacket with a badge. They are holding what appears to be a rock or mineral specimen in their hand. The photograph is in black and white and has a slightly grainy, high-contrast appearance typical of older photographic prints. The subject is positioned facing slightly to the side, with a shadow behind them, and appears to be standing at a table or surface.
