K. Capt Dean A Bernier, FV3005370, Asst Flying Safety Officer. I have investigated the UFO report by Mr Dick Carpenter on 5 June 1967 in accordance with AFR 80-17 and 17A. A thorough check with the Sheriff's office, FAA and Dept of Public Safety produced no other sightings of this occurrence. I personally interviewed Mr Carpenter and he assured me he had seen bright meteors before and that this in no way resembled that type of thing. His narrative description indicates that what he saw was at high altitude and the manner in which it dissipated leaves me this one explanation: There were thunderstorms to the north and on the movement to the ENE was over gradually dissipating. The weather personnel explained that under these conditions tremendous downdrafts are established and a phenomenon known as "fireball lightning" sometimes occurs. It suggests from the base of the cloud in the wake of a cloud-to-ground lightning strike. The lightning would account for the area being illuminated and this reaction time would make it appear closer than actuality and going away from him. If the appearance of going away is not going away from him.
