H. A phenomenon known as fireball type lightning. Associated with lightning bolts from thunderstorms when special conditions exist - Extreme downwind activity. It follows the path of the lightning bolt. It bursts from the base of the cloud as a "ball of fire" and diminishes as its path formed by the lightning bolt dissipates.

I. None.

J. None.

K. Capt Dean A Bernier, FV3005370, Asst Flying Safety Officer. I have investigated the UFO report by Mr Dick Carpenter on 5 June 1967 in accordance with AFR 80-17 and 17A. A thorough check with the Sheriff's office, FAA and Dept of Public Safety produced no other sightings of this occurrence. I personally interviewed Mr Carpenter and he assured me he had seen bright meteors before and that this in no way resembled that type of thing. His narrative description indicated that what he saw was at high altitude and the manner in which it dissipated leaves me this explanation: There were thunderstorms to the north and east of his location with tops at 50M and bases at 19M. Their movement to the ENE was over gradually descending landscape. The weather personnel explained that under these conditions tremendous downdrafts are established and a phenomenon known as "fireball" lightning sometimes occurs. It erupts from the base of the cloud in the wake of a cloud-to-ground lightning strike. The lightning would account for the area being illuminated and his reaction time to look up would enable him to catch the fireball stage. The altitude would make it appear closer than actually and going straight down would give it the appearance of going away from him.
