Hello, Mr. Moore. This is Professor Hynek at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

Yes, sir.

I'm a consultant for the Air Force on the matter of Unidentified Flying Objects. And it has been a long while since we have been through these reports, but the report officially made from the Patrick Air Force Base, went to the Pentagon, then it went to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and finally I got it.

We are still trying to track down -- around the 4th of August there were an awful lot of sightings all over the country. 

Yes, I understand that.

We are still trying to pin down what some of these were. A great many of them were stars and balloons. But some of these are very puzzling, and the one that you and Mrs. Schilde 

Schilde, is it? That's right. And Mr. Ivy and Mr. Scott reported. I'm not sure they were the same thing, either. But you and Schilde were together, I believe. And Ivy and Scott were.

That's right.

It's a very puzzling thing. I wonder if you wouldn't mind to get a little - if you would like to ask a few questions.

All right.

If you want the spelling of my name -- it's H Y N E K. And the initials are J. A. Hynek. 

I'd like to. My name is J. A. Hynek. From time to time the Air Force over the past number of years has called upon me to assist in the evaluation of these reports.

Transcribing the text from the image:

He has asked me to work with them on these things as an astronomer. 
M: Is this on tapes?
H: No, not on tapes. This is for my own information and for the Air Force. The report I have here is identifying information and observations on these matters: Edward Ruppelt, Charles Maney, James Irvine and B G Scott. These four men are all officers of the Cocoa Police Department and may be contacted at the Police Headquarters Building, 325 Riveredge Avenue, Cocoa Florida.  
M: It's changed -- 300 Beauson Boulevard
H: Now, then let me begin by asking if you have had any thoughts on this subject since - it's been a number of months now - do you still question, or do you have a feeling of what it was you saw? 
M: Oh, yes, in my mind I can still see it. It was my first experience I can think back * right now and I know definitely what we observed - at least what I observed - was fascinating to me and it'll stay * with me the rest of my life. And it was the first time for me. I've heard stories and read, and so forth, some of them, but I never went overboard. You know, 'TILL that particular night.
H: Well, you're the kind of observer I like to talk to because I don't like to talk to people who are firm believers in flying saucers, or something like that. But we get -- and I've been a consultant/for the Air Force now for/fifteen years because this stuff all started way back, you know, just before 1950. And most of the things that we get we can explain very easily as balloons or stars or this and that. But there are each year a number of cases that are really puzzling, and yours is certainly one of them.

So, in other words, you still don't know what it might have been that you saw. Is that right?
Mr: No, but I am almost 100 per cent sure that it wasn't a balloon or anything that the Air Force is and other sightings they might say. Well, I seen a picture one time of a test flight of a Boeing aircraft. Behind it was the engine the jet picture was given. 4. It looked like a flying saucer, and they said (?) off to be a flaw in the emulsion (?) on the paper, and I said: "Well, O.K. To me it looks like a flying saucer." The picture itself, though. She the Air Force likes to pass it off as being a balloon, or reflection of light, or something like that. Well, that's all well and good, but -- well -- as I haven't ever seen it a second thought, for after two or three weeks we were questioned about it. We had local people asking us about it, and so on and so on. And after that, well, I said, they can pass it off as XXXX to whatever it is that they want it to be, but we know what we did see.
Mr:  Well, now, this is the point. Even though I am the consultant for the Air Force, I am not the one XXXX responsible for what they say.
Mr: Right, right.
Mr: I am a scientist in my own right. And I am puzzled about what it was you saw, and I certainly would like to check whether some facts here are correct. You say that the objects were observed for about 15 minutes, it says here. Is that right?
Mr: That's about right. In this diamond formation. Then I seen one

A man and his wife -- they had binoculars. I looked at the diamond formation through the binoculars and they told me if you watched it closely you could see it move. One moved out of the formation, and then it came back again. We watched that for a long while. Then I said that maybe the one that moved was the one that I saw in flight and then it came back. And so we just kept watching and watching and then at 12 o'clock we had to pick up our relief and 

H: What was the light like? Was it clear?

M: Oh, yes, it was very clear.

H: And how did these objects differ. Were they brighter, fainter, a different color, or what?

M: Well the light -- looking through the darkness -- it cast off like a glow, white, and orange white.

M: Did you look at the sky also?
M: Oh, yes, to compare.
H: To compare - exactly what I want. How did they compare?
M: Like a group of stars (?) the same white. I kept looking and then I switched back to the formation. And the formation was different - casting off these lights, you know. Then I looked back at the stars
H: It gets more interesting all the time. Let's go back to when you first saw them. How did you first sight them?
M: It's now. I was out on a call. It was approximately 11:25, when sandwiches were served, and I came back to the car. I heard Ed say that he was in contact with a 7:20 on the radio in the car. I heard the radio and I said:
"Ed, what have you got?" He said: "We've got a guy flying a saucer. And with that I looked up, and I saw it. You know, it was scared and I had the mike in my hand, looking up and watching this thing fly -- moving like crazy!
H: What direction were you facing?
M: I was facing east.
H: And it was moving west.
M: It was moving west.
H: Waste. It couldn't have been a satellite because satellites don't move that way.
M: I see. When he said: "He's looking," and I said: "Yeah. And you can see it" - you know - these things are about 20 miles an hour, when I looked up, you know, just for a second. And then I got under the dashboard.

d street light and that blocked my view. Then I steered out
of Cambridge Drive, and I drove on Pikes Boulevard., – I
stopped again. xxxxxxxxxxx was standing still. I
looked up – and said "Look, Ed, it's standing still."
How much of an arc had it moved through? How much of the sky -
how low down in the sky was it when you first saw it?
Well, it was low enough to really distinguish it, as from the
stars, you know, and everything else in the sky moving. It was a
bright light for me --
I t mean, you didn't have to look very far up, then?
No. No. And that fascinated me.
And you saw it coming toward you?
Well, it was going – I was travelling east, and it was going back
toward the west. It was like going over my head. And then
I followed it and then it got a street light and I got
like pain in the street light. And I couldn't see it any
more. And then I got around and xxxx** up on Pikes Boulevard --
also facing east. And then I got out of Pikes Boulevard and I
stood there — mike in my hand — and I looked up and I said

a distant formation." And I looked up and said: "There --
Then he said: "Well, come on down" he said. "I'm down here with
a binoculars." And I said, "Well, ok." And I shot down Indian
River Drive and Pikes Boulevard and looked up, and live me the
binoculars. And I looked up, and even without the binoculars you
could see the formation. And he said: "That one moved and it came

Back.** ********** And I said: "Well, I wonder if it is the one I see in the flight." 
H: When you saw the stationary one, can you be sure it was the same thing you saw moving?
M: Yeah -- it was the same reflection of light. 
H: I see. It was different from a star.
M: Oh, definitely.
H: O.K. Now, this diamond formation - did you say it was nearly overhead?
M: I see. How far from overhead was it? Was it to the north, to the south, or --
M: It was directly - from where we were standing - ******** it was precisely directly overhead.
H: Directly overhead.
M: Yeah - I had to lean back with the binoculars and look up. And the one that was off - in the west - I leaned on a fellow's back smoke to keep it steady, you know. And it was casting off those lights - along with the diamond formation - the other one stayed white.
H: Let me ask you this: If you had held your hand outstretched, if you could have held it - excuse me just a second - there was an interruption - someone said there was another phone call but I'll get that later.
M: I'm getting hoarse. I got myself a strap through my throat coming in.
H: I think.
H: You shouldn't - you go on duty pretty soon, don't you?
M: Twelve o'clock.
H: You'd better go home.

Mr. Yeah, I am. I'll just take a couple of napkins.
It. Yeah. This is very interesting. There are a couple of other little points that I would like to cover. The size of this diamond formation. I was just about to ask that, if you held your hands - you know - stretched your arms out and opened your hands, would your thumb have covered this diamond formation?

Mr: No - (rest inaudible)

Hr: It was larger than xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx a finger, then, larger than a thumb?

Mr: I don't think it covered it.

Hr: Your hand would have?

Mr: Yeah, my hand would have.

Hr: So, that's good to know. Now, were all the lights in the diamond formation the same brightness, or were some brighter?

Mr: No, they were about the same.

Hr: About the same, yes. And the light that seemed to move from it - how many times the size of the diamond formation did it get away? About/one diamond, two diamonds?

Mr: Well, you see, I didn't - it was about one move from it.

Hr: Oh, you didn't?

Mr: No, to me it was the diamond formation. And that was the one that was off in the west/east the fixed position that I had seen in my headlight.

Mr: How far west? From the thing was it?

Mr: Pretty far - pretty far over.

Roughly speaking, - and this is rather important - was it directly west, or a little to the north of west or south of west, or how?
M: It was northwest.
H: Northwest. And about how far up from the horizon - half-way, quarter-way toward the top?  You know, how far up would you have to stretch your arm?
M: Three-quarters of the way.
H: Three-quarters. So it was pretty high.
M: Yes, it was.
H: Yes, as you see, - then this thing, the Air Force always tried to say, was a star. Well, your own mind, how did that light differ from a bright star?
M: It seems to me that a star stays bright and makes twinkles just a little bit. But that object was casting off the different lights.
I could definitely distinguish - it would be white, and then the greenish tint, and then the orange. And then it would go back to white, and then orange. You know.
H: And there were stars near that were not doing that?
M: That's right.
H: And how much brighter xxxxxxxxxxxxxbrighterxx than the brightest stars were xxxxxxx around it were would you say twice as bright, much brighter, or what?
M: When it was white, I think it was a little bright.
H: A little brighter than a star. Yes. The diamond formation itself didn't move?
M: It didn't seem to. But he said he noticed one move away from the formation and then back again (for 2 seconds). And that's what I saw.

Kept trying to see. And then he said he would come on at 12:00 o'clock and pick up the guys to go to work, see. And then I said, "Ok."

Hi: And then did you looked up at the sky a few nights after that also to --

M: I did. Just trying to see if I could apt that diamond formation, you know. And I couldn't do it.

Hi: You couldn't. Well, that was very, very interesting. And I don't know what it was either. Lor does seem as if there are a few other things --

M: Would you like to talk to Charles?

Hi: Yes, that might be very interesting.

M: And this is for  

Hi: Hynek

M: Of Northwestern University. You say where?
Hi: Evanston, Illinois - that's near Chicago

M: O.K. Mr Hynek. I'm going to see if I can contact Ed for you.
Hey, Ed - Come here a minute, will you. This is the director of Northwestern University. He would like to talk to you about 

E: Professor _____ (introduced himself) - a civilian

Hi: I had better explain what I am about here. As you know, the Air Force occasionally calls me in as an astronomer to consult with them on some of the odd sightings that are reported. Around the 4th of August we had quite a few. I was called and especially from the west in Texas and in Oklahoma. You may have heard of them. I am slowly working through some of these cases and trying to come to some conclusion as to what the things might have been. And your sighting - yours and some others. So I would like to discuss this with you if I may.

interests me very, very much, because I can't exactly figure
out that they were stars.  This diamond formation that you saw
- now how did it differ from the stars in the general area.
S: Well, you should see that it was lower. I mean - it stood out
like something that would be a mile high as opposed to something
that was/2O miles high.  You could see that it was definitely
lower and that it wasn't a star. The color was different, the
brightness - it was brighter, much brighter.  You could see it
wasn't a star. There were many, many, many stars in the sky.
H: This is a point that I am very much interested in getting down,
because I know the Air Force will surely say: "Well, it was stars
they saw."  And I want to be able to say - well, how do you
explain this then, you know, is the same thing of course
those - if you hold your thumbs straight out in front of you as
far as you can and had held this up over the diamond formation
would the thumbs have mass covered the thing, or not quite, or
Si: Oh, no - I would say the thumbs wouldn't cover two of them.  You know,
one directly above the other.  But the others would be - you would
have to face your thumb in the other direction (H: I get you)
to get them all.  If I recall correctly, they were quite
a bit apart.
H: You've given me something new that I didn't get from Mr Moore.
the impression that they were lower down than the sky, so to speak.
S: Yes.
H: Now, were they all of exactly the same brightness?
S: Well, I would say yes, they were, except for the interest of the
light seemed to change.  I mean it would set brighter, then a
little duller or all, not together, but individually.

H: I see, they were of variable intensity, but not as together.
S: Yes, that's right. 
H: I see, what was the kin condition of the sky? Were there are clouds at all?
S: No, sir, it was very clear.
H: Very clear, yes. Compared to the brightest star -- there were some bright areas at that season -- the star Arcturus which is in the northwest which is a very bright thing and there's in the northeast -- did you make a comparison of colors with the stars at that time?
S: Yes, sir. I'd say that these appeared to be as bright as any in the sky, may be even a little brighter.
S: Okay, go on, he cut in on us.
H: Mr. Moore said something about having seen a light travelling across the sky. Did you see any motion any place?
S: Yes, I did.
H: But not the diamond formation? 
S: Yes, one from the diamond formation -- left the diamond formation.
H: Was it the fifth one?
S: No, it was the fourth one. It was the one that - you see, the diamond shape would be the long points of the diamond were facing toward the west (as I see) and the short points were facing north and south. And the most westerly light of the diamond left the diamond and went out to the western section of the sky. Quite a distance, transiting the one that the Moore saw. You see, those were five in the sky. But those were only four in the diamond shape. And the most westerly one in the diamond shape went out to the western section of the town at a high rate.

of speed. It looked like just a flash. And it stayed out there next to this other one for 30 seconds or so, and then it came back and resumed its position in the diamond. It did be damned. This is important: How many degrees per second did it go, that is how fast it travel? Faster than a jet, for instance?

S: Y CM, yes, sir. It looked to me like a meteor. It was a streak. Then, when it stopped, and it stayed out there, and then streaked back.

H: Good heavens. Then you could watch it as it streaked?

S: Yes, it was looking through binoculars.

H: As it approached the west, did it stop abruptly and did it slow down?

S: No, it slowed down.

H: It slowed down, and then stopped.

S: Yes. As far as I could see, the area that I was looking at it would be in the field of vision would be three or four feet as far as the field of vision was concerned. If you understand what I mean.

H: I'm not quite sure. You were looking through binoculars (S: Yes, sir) And it went so fast that you couldn't follow it with binoculars (MAX XXX)

S: No, sir, I had to pick it up again, and as I picked it up it was slowing down, and then it stopped. (H: I see) And then I kept looking at it and it was fairly close to these other objects and then it came back and resumed its position.

H: Did it get as close to the other objects as it was to the others of the diamond formation.

S: Well, it's difficult to say. I would say that the husband - he's a banker - I don't think he would be really a dependable person but his wife I think would be.
H: Well, O K, I get the message. It is very difficult to find people who can intelligently describe something like this, because, well - they just are not used to it - for one thing. Now, let me see if there is anything -- did you have any feeling - well, it's probably funny for me to say so -- but I think if I were watching something like that I might feel a little frightened or wondering if someone was there watching me, or something.
S: This is what I had. I was amazed more than anything, but I did have that feeling.
H: I'm a little surprised that you didn't get more people to watch it with you.
S: Oh, there was about five or six people where I was.
H: Oh, there were.
S: Yes, sir.
H: Do you have the names of any of them?

COCOA, FLORIDA

REPORTED SIGHTINGS - BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA

ON 7 AUGUST 1965, APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS, A DISC-SHAPED OBJECT, ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 50 AND 60 FEET IN DIAMETER, WAS OBSERVED OVER THE BANANA RIVER, NEAR COCOA, FLORIDA, BY AN UNNAMED WITNESS. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO BE HOVERING QUIETLY, AND ON OCCASIONS WOULD MOVE RAPIDLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE, THEN RETURN TO A HOVERING POSITION.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 MINUTES BEFORE IT FLEW OFF RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

ANOTHER WITNESS, NAME UNKNOWN, OBSERVED A SIMILAR OBJECT ON THE SAME EVENING BUT AT A SLIGHTLY EARLIER TIME.

No, I just have the man and wife there on that corner, and I live with another stopped in a car and they saw it. I have no idea who they are. This is very interesting, of course, and I could tell much but in examining a number of these cases around that time, I am trying to find out whether the same sort of things were seen you see in different parts of the country. Actually, this all seemed to start on July 31st, and there were sightings - a lot of reports on August 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then by August 5 it pretty much backed down. But during those few nights there were an awful lot of reports even from some sae bases out west. And this is why this was the night that they did have a shot at the Cape, and now on this was a night shot they were having then. We are having a shot Saturday, but of course, that's going to be a daylight shot.

I don't know whether that has anything to do with it - I don't think. I thought at first that it was something from the Cape - I mean, some kind of system that they might have put in the air, you know. Yes. Let me ask this: - a thing I have frequently asked people. If you had some extra means way up in the sky that would most closely resemble what you saw, what object or objects would you pick? to put up there that would look something like this? This to me looked like the end of a flare? Do you know what type of flare I mean? The flare that's used in the railroad? Yes, the railroad type flare. This is how it looked if you were looking directly at the flame. This is the way it would look. Not the lousitation, just the flame.

S: In this same report received from the CO tonight, I seem to have a feeling that some of the statements colored lights observed by four policemen were reflections from the ground.

3: Yes, sir. That's what they said. 

H: Well, now, it's hard for me to believe that reflections could look like that. Reflections are generally diffuse. Of course, I am asking a leading question here. I shouldn't ask the question this way. But the impression I have gotten from what you are saying is that the -- well, let me put it this way. Let us suppose that we were looking at a street light at a considerable distance. How would the light you saw differ from the street lights?

S: Well, Mere Street lights I believe now on a clear night you could see that the street light was round, that it was of a fixed intensity. This was not round. It was like a free burning light, like a match light, not a manufactured light, but a regular burning. And the intensity part (?) I think that's what gave the impression of different colored lights.

H: In other words, it gave you the impression that the light was coming from it.

S: That's right. Un huh.

H: Up to this time we have all had the impression that those lights were points like stars.

Mystery Blamed On Reflections
PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE -- The Air Force said Tuesday night that reflections caused by an unusual weather phenomenon over the City of Cocoa Beach Monday night and early Tuesday were responsible for reports of strange lights in the sky.
Lt. Col. Patrick D. McCaslin of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations said the reflections created the appearance of objects in the sky that moved rapidly and appeared to change position several times.

Cocoa UFOs Reported Reflections
PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE FLORIDA SIGHTING DATA SHOWED SEVEN BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OBJECTS OBSERVED BY CITY POLICE IN COCOA, FLORIDA, TUESDAY NIGHT, AUGUST 3, APPARENTLY WERE REFLECTIONS FROM THE GROUND. PATRICK AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN SAID AN INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE LIGHTS, DESCRIBED AS ROUND AND ORANGE AND APPEARED OVER THE CITY, WERE REFLECTIONS CAUSED BY A COLD AIR MASS CAUSING REFRACTION OF GROUND LIGHTS.
THE POLICEMEN SAID FOUR OF THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO MANEUVER AND CHANGE POSITIONS, SEVEN. THE AIR FORCE SAID ANY UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS REPORTED WOULD BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED, BUT IN THIS CASE THE REFLECTIONS WERE CAUSED BY NORMAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND NO AIRCRAFT WERE FLYING IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.
THE AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT AFTER AN INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THE POLICEMEN'S OBSERVATION WAS NOT QUESTIONED BUT THEY PLANNED TO QUESTION THE POLICEMEN WHO MADE THE OBSERVATIONS.

Lights
Mirrored
By Sky?

PATRICK AFB - (UPI) - The mysterious colored
lights observed by four policemen over the city of Cocoa
apparently were reflections from the ground, the Air
Force said Friday.

A spokesman for Patrick AFB said an investigation 
showed that a similar condition of temperature inversion
over the city caused the lights to appear mirrored in the
sky. He said a cold air mass below a warm layer of air 
caused the phenomenon to be observed around the city.

"The spottlights and other lights in the area, would have 
been seen mirrored in the sky for up to 15 minutes," said the
spokesman. "The Air Force has completed its investigation
and determined that the formation actually was a mirage."
The spokesman said no unusual objects or aircraft were
in the sky at the time.

Police Aid Testimony 
Colorful Objects 
Seen in Cocoa Sky
By Sanders Lamont and James K. Yates, also reported seeing these objects in the sky above the police station. 
COCOA - Multi-colored objects were reported Wednesday by eight persons, said to have been seen for about an hour in the sky over Cocoa.
The first report came at 9:24 p.m. Wednesday from an individual who said the objects were 5 to 6 miles northeast of town.
The objects were described as brightly colored and changing color as they moved about in the sky, with the observers estimating them to be about the size of a standard automobile. They were said to move slowly and were visible for about an hour. The objects were first sighted about 9 p.m. and were last seen at 10 p.m.
The unidentified objects are assumed to be some type of aircraft, but neither the Air Force nor the CAA base in Melbourne has any knowledge of planes in that area at that time.
Command at the Patrick Air Force Base said no planes were known to be in the area, and the CAA base in Melbourne also said they have no information on any aircraft in the sky over Cocoa at the time the objects were reported.
The observers, who were not identified, claim the objects were easily visible and were seen by several persons. They were described as being round and saucer-shaped, and were said to move about rapidly yet silently. Flashing of different colored lights, blue, green, yellow and red, was also reported during the time the objects were under observation.

7 JW&E 69
SPACEMAN z: "Tsk, tsk,
looks like that is one of those
silly machines that the
earth-people have been talking
about - wheels and
all. Doesn't that just seem the
most primitive thing to
us space visitors?"
SPACEMAN X: "Must be
something the earth-people call
a 'automobile'. We don't have
anything like that on the
space craft. But their machines
can only move along the
ground - just crawl like insects
without any wings at all."
SPACEMAN Z: "Yes, it is
amusing building as it does on
some ancient instinct of the
earth-people that says 'Service
Station' - whatever that means.
As if a mere station could
service their crude
contraptions!"
SPACEMAN X: "Marvelous,
isn't it? And all the
primitive things they have to
do to keep those machines
running. Stopping at places and
pouring strange liquids into
openings, and cranking and
pushing and shoving. Makes me
shudder to think of the
trouble they have with their
crude technology."
SPACEMAN Z: "Well, it
certainly is all rather quaint and
curious, isn't it? But I suppose
we mustn't be too critical. They
are just beginning, after all,
and they seem to be
progressing, in their own
awkward way. Perhaps someday
they'll develop something a
little more advanced. Who
knows?"
ONE FINAL NOTE:
The Air Force tells us the
above conversation was monitored
by their interplanetary
surveillance equipment. It's a
rather droll and somewhat
patronizing commentary, but
very illuminating as to the
Spacemen's attitude toward our
automotive civilization.
