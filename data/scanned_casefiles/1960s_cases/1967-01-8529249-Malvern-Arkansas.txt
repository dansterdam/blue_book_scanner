   The preparing officer interviewed Miss on 4 January 1967.


- page 27 -

The observer was sincere in what she believed she saw and the interviewer had no reason to doubt her. Miss appeared to be a normal and intelligent person for her age of 15. In view of the fact that there are so many witnesses to the incident indicates there was something unusual sighted. However, only Miss saw the object at close range. The possible cause of the sighting is undetermined at the present time and unless other facts are brought to light the causes most probably will never be ascertained.
