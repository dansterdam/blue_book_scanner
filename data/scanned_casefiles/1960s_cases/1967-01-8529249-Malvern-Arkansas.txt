Based on the OCR of the text in the document, the output is:

The observer was sincere in what she believed she saw and the interview had no reason to doubt her. According to her statement, the object was close enough to be normal and intelligent life, and there are so many witnesses to the incident indicates there was something unusual sighted. However, only time can show the object as close range. The possible cause of the sighting is undetermined at the present time and unless other facts are brought to considered.
