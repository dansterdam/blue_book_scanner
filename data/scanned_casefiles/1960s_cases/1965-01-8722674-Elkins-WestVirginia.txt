Dear Dr Menzel,

We received a report from a passenger on an airline flight near Elkins, West Virginia. The sighting has been evaluated as Sun Dog 15. A copy of this report is forwarded to you because of your particular interest in this phenomena. Should you feel that this observation is not a Sun Dog observation we would appreciate your professional opinion.

Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:

Reference is made to the unidentified flying object which you observed as a passenger in an aircraft on 22 January 1965 over the area of Elkins, West Virginia.

Your observation has been evaluated as a solar image by Doctor J. Allen Hynek, the Air Force civilian consultant to Project Blue Book. While rare, this unique phenomena has appeared before, and on one occasion it was photographed. This phenomena occurs only at certain angles with the sun, and the reflecting surface is a thin layer of ice crystals in the atmosphere. This layer is transparent and not visible from the aircraft.

I am enclosing a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force major project on unidentified flying objects. I hope this report will be of interest to you.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 28 January 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The UFO was stated by an unusual movement which raised my body spectacularly high in the plane seat. The bright, roundly light was traveling in the same direction, and what appeared to be the same ground speed. My attention was drawn to the fact that the object, if not an unusual reflection from the aircraft or other source, was not undulating with respect to the valley, hills, and depression as the object passed over the mountains old path. It was straight and unwavering. It gave the impression of being translucent, but not really so at the same instant; it appeared to be so very close to the ground.

The pilot banked the jet to approximately 150 down on the port side, appeared to make a slight change in heading to the left, at which time the object left my view, under the tail of the jet. The object was not in view when the jet returned to straight and level flight approximately 10-15 seconds later. I did not see it again. The precise location might be difficult to determine if the civilian locations make the arrangement different to Sutton Airport at the same time such schedule of flight circumstances. The object appeared as a flat plane, with no 3rd dimension.
