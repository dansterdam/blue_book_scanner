The record card appears to document an incident that occurred on August 30, 1960, in South Tewksbury, Massachusetts.

Dear sir,
I wish to make some explanations on the objects which my mother has seen. I'm quite mother is authentic and she would not go out of her way to tell such a thing. She certainly could have seen if she cared. Then the window which afforded her of the view, not mine, is quite due to a phenomenon of parallelism. May those objects have often reported these times. If therefore, these which have be more than 75 or 90 yards off, whatever they who. If these objects in the sky, they would only be visible for several seconds, or the time required. Besides, some quantity claims the contrary experience. For some reason, astronomy is actually not involved in any media reports which may indicate what may occasion come for some investigation.
