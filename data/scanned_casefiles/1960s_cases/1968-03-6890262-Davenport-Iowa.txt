2. LOCATION Davenport, Iowa
19. CONCLUSION Case: Cetee (Unresellable Report) Photo: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted and photographed a grey, grayish-white object. However, the observer was requested to submit polaroid photos, but failed to do so. In the course of the followup contacts, the date and time of the sighting could not be ascertained definitely, as the observer indicated uncertainty on still another, 15 minutes. He also stated that other unidentified objects were sighted, but addresses, even after requested to do so, never gave any further details.

HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
OFFICE OF AEROSPACE STUDIES
PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT No. 14
3. RADAR VISUAL CASES
a. DAVENPORT, IOWA - MARCH 6, 1968 
On the night of March 6, 1968, at 9:55 p.m. CST, a ground observer at Davenport, Iowa, observed a large, dark, elliptical object with a row of bright lights along the edge. The sighting was reported immediately to the Quad-City Airport in Moline, Illinois. The airport controller stated that his radarscope showed an unknown target in the same area described by the witness. The radar tracking lasted about 12 minutes.

The unknown object remained stationary for a short period, then began moving slowly away at an estimated speed of 75 mph. As the object moved away, the radar blips became weaker and weaker until the object disappeared from the radarscope.

The case is listed as "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.

The image appears to be a photographic print from an old UFO report document. It shows a mostly blank, white area with some scattered dark specks or anomalies. On the right side, there is a distinct darker vertical shape, which could potentially be a UFO or some other unidentified object. However, the quality of the image is quite poor and does not allow for clear identification of any specific object.

CASE 6890262
LOCATION: DAVENPORT, IOWA
DATE: MARCH 6, 1968

SUMMARY:
On March 6, 1968, the witness, an eight-year-old boy, was playing in his backyard when he noticed a strange object in the sky. He described it as a shiny, metallic disc-shaped object that hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing rapidly. The witness's mother also observed the object. No other witnesses were identified.

INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES:
The witness provided a detailed description of the object, stating that it was approximately 30 feet in diameter and had a smooth, metallic surface. He said the object emitted no sound and appeared to be hovering at an estimated altitude of 300-400 feet. The witness's mother corroborated his account, but no physical evidence or other witnesses were found.

Enclosed is the text transcribed from the document:

"Explanation of your description of the event as you described would on the face of it seem to indicate a possible physical anomaly. However, it is with much difficulty that I can speculate as to the actual nature of the event when only a cursory description is available. Inasmuch as the normal investigative procedures of this office have not been followed, it is unlikely that any definitive conclusions can be drawn without additional data. I would appreciate if you could furnish any further details you may have available which might assist in a more detailed analysis. Thank you for your cooperation."

Transcription of the text:

Dear sir:
I am writing you once more regarding my sighting of a UFO on April 5, 1968. As I stated in my previous letter, I was outside my home in Davenport, Iowa at approximately 9:30 PM when I observed a large, oval-shaped object hovering in the sky. The object was approximately 75 feet in diameter and was illuminated with a bright white light. The object hovered silently for several minutes before slowly ascending and eventually disappearing from view.

I am still very interested in learning more about this incident and would appreciate any additional information or insights you can provide. Please let me know if you need any further details from me.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]
