UFO Observation and Photographs, March 3, 1968

Davenport, Iowa 52803

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of March 3, 1968.

2. Request information on how long you viewed the unidentified object. (total duration)

3. In your original letter you stated that there were fourteen witnesses to your sighting. It seems inconceivable that all fourteen persons would refuse to give you their names and addresses.

4. We are returning the negative you forwarded to us. When we wrote our letter of April 11, 1968, we did not realize that you had photographed the object with a Polaroid camera. The original Polaroid print is necessary in order to perform an accurate photographic analysis.

5. Please estimate your distance from the telephone pole which appears in your photograph.

6. All data must be submitted so that a complete scientific investigation may be made. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
