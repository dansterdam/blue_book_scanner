Reference your recent unidentified observation of
16 - 18 March 1966. Your observation is characteristic
of a meteor sighting. However, the information we have
received is not sufficient for a positive identification.
We would appreciate your completing the attached FTD
Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided. If you
would like to fill out the attached form from Dr.
, of the American Meteor Society, we will forward
a copy to him for his files.
