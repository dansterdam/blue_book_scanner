35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This sighting was one of interest to me because of the style of entry and the blacking off and maintaining this attitude for the duration of their flight.

After the first office clearance, the small vapor or smoke. Clouds formed into one large closed and continued on nearly west and began to break up northwest of Dayton, Ohio.

At 1:45 I went outside and estimated level of cloud at 3000 feet.

The time these objects were visible outside the clouds were approx. 30 partly. The complete time given was in this format: the total time from the first to the second sighting and the first cloud formation.

May find it strange that these objects were visible to me then I thought.

Conversation with R [illegible] Laura, Ohio on 25 August 1966

Something wired came from the East last night at 1125 pm. Between Troy and West Milton. Left a contrail and left a cloud formation. Out of this orange disc shaped object, on its side, came % out of cloud and watched it for eight minutes. Then a little cloud appeared and out of the front side came the orange and then all the clouds formed into one. Proceeded home and these clouds were breaking up. Thought it was approximately 5000 ft alt. His wife called his attention to it, looked like a ball, thought may be it was n aircraft breaking up. It would come and go. There was a large cloud coverage. It entered the atmosphere on 120 deg angle to the left, entered west. This thing was traveling from east to West. Came out from a cloud and then went back ina cloud. Called the Sheriff about it, don't know if he had any other reports. This cloud formation went into one main cloud and then broke up. Mr. Beck said he would be willing to fill out a form and would make a sketch of what he observed. Form 164 sent to him on 25 Aug 66.
