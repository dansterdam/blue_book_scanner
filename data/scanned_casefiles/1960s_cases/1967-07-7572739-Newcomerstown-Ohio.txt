This page does not contain a photograph. It appears to be part of an old document related to Project Blue Book, likely a UFO report.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 
5 Day, July Month, 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Just the majesty of the object and the manner in which it handled itself are of the utmost interest to one who had this experience. It is hoped that further investigations of this type of phenomena will be undertaken in the future.

The configuration of this light does not conflict with any an aircraft.

ATTN OF: TDPT/UFO

SUBJECT: UFO Observation

TO: Newcomerstown, Ohio 43832

Reference your July 1967 observation of an unidentified flying object. Prior to reaching our final conclusion on your sighting we need to know the exact time the object was observed. The questionnaire you completed indicated that the sighting occurred on July 26, 1967; however, the date appears to be a note from your clarifying this discrepancy.

DONALD G. MARQUARDT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems

Dear Sir:
As you will see from my note enclosed, the date was July 27, 1967, not July 26 as I had previously stated. We think the daily was the 27th but are not absolutely certain. At any rate it was very exciting at the time and caused quite a bit of talk in the area.
