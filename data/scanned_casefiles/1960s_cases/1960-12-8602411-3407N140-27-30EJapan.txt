3. LOCATION Kasumiga-ura
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION Ground-Visuel 
5. PHOTOS G. Y.

8. COURSE 0 
9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object appeared to be hovering and extinguish rapidly. 
10. CONCLUSIONS: No data for evaluation. This object has all of the characteristics of a "psychological" case in that there is no available evidence which indicates a real or physical existence of the object. The sighting might be classified as another example of the general phenomenon known as the "false target presentation" or "ghost target" appearance, which frequently occurs in radar operation, and occasionally in visual sighting, but for which satisfactory scientific explanation is not available at this time.
