Ave.
San Pedro, Calif.
90732

Dears Sirs,

I have received your Project Blue Book, I and my brother would like to tell you about the U.F.O. we have spotted a big red white light over Catalina, on March 30, 1966, at the time was precisely 6:29 P.M.

We live right on the coast of California in a city called San Pedro. I know there is not any kind of star above Catalina from our view point. It was on 90 degrees about Avalon Bay, Catalina. Facing toward Catalina it would be at 11 o'clock, like they would say on 12 o'clock. High altitude was hovering about 1 mile high above the island. It was hovering until an airplane came to 2 miles left of it. Then it disappeared to a little red glow, similar to a hot optical red was surrounded by a ring of smoke.

This is about all the information I could give you at this time.

I thank you for your time and cooperation.

Sincerely,

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - Beverly, Massachusetts - 11/15/66
DATE: 13 December 1966
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman: NICAP MASS SUBCOM
TO: NICAP
Washington, D.C.                     cc: AFSC-MTD (TDDES)
                                         Congressman Wm. Bates
ATTENTION: Richard Hall
            Assistant Director

SIGHTING BACKGROUND:
I met Mr. Richard Symmes after lecturing to a group at the First Congregational Church, Swampscott, Massachusetts. Later I dispatched Investigator Gerry Storer to interview him. Mr. Symmes filled out the standard NICAP UFO FORM and signed it. A copy is attached to this memo.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
Mr. Symmes and Mr. Burkee were hunting duck in a small boat off the coast of Marblehead. Looking over in the direction of Beverly, 15 Symmes spotted two strange-looking objects hovering over the Beverly area about six miles away from them in the Northwest. These objects were solid, flat, dark in shape that were observing must be UFOs. They watched off and on for about 15 minutes while hunting and then while looking away, the objects apparently vanished. Mr. Symmes eliminated balloons or aircraft due to the shapes and non-standard or the objects. He insisted that they were solid objects.

EVALUATION:
It is hard to say just what was observed. Neither observer saw the objects arrive or leave and they seemed to hover with no motion whatsoever. The wind was blowing at a good 20 knots, NE so clouds would have moved quite a distance in 15 minutes. The lower object seemed to be a shimmering while the smaller object above it appeared non-reflective. It is possible that some type of mirage was witnessed. In itself there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the report involves an authentic UFO. It is submitted for informational purposes. It might serve as supplementary evidence if other reports were received for that time and date.

Respectfully submitted,

18 NOV 20 CASE
MORNING OF 15 CC

Dear Sir:

About the game hour - that the B52 blew up at Stone Lake, Wis. I went out to let my dogs out to run. I noticed in the sky north by east a shiny glowing object in the sky not very high above the tree line. It was moving back and forward. I think it was reason that caused the moving so I set my eye on the corner of my house and it seemed to be trying to hold steady in the wind.

Two or three years ago I noticed the same kind of object over my neighbor's home. An ex-service Sergeant and a member of the Communication workers union, a Communist riddled union. I have that he was eloquent. He doesn't send his children to Sunday school and he is not a church member.

It is my belief that they have used some kind of rays to displace the B52. Another fact is that my seeing the object on close house about 5:32 PM on Saturday came this B52 exploded around 7 PM. Paul (Town) works on the north side of Kinloch. He comes home Friday afternoon. And goes back to work Sunday afternoon. So he lost in this event the time of the explosion.

22 NOV 66                                    Ft. Case Indiv. Only

Los Angeles, Anaheim
P.O. Torrance, South California
December 3, 1966

Dear Sir,

I'm writing briefly record at 10:30 p.m. I was stopping on the beach when I first, what I might view, two miles up the coast from my location. To my short phase watching these two, one of them began to jump vertically and it came straight at me at a humiliating great height is some ten more than a hundred to a great many. I shot a few minute after I was down on the beach again but with some friends. One of the boys, the one which, hardly moved, was sighting up and out of the hill. He was the one definitely sure what I was able to seeing out jumping at a great further south from where etc. well, another place I appeared but it didn't do much.

I a casual pastime on the beach, the day last area was spent generally, on the move about watching. I watched a nearby place, coming up from the north at about the point that a couple appeared to move at from each. I called to the second two points it was to him out immediately after this, but I was not able to see what part of light in a fraction of a second. After this, very little happened, and finally, I believe, including one light, the trees seemed to be flashing lights at east. This, whether, and must tell this.

Cornwall Joins the UFO Club

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT PHOTOGRAPHED-16-Year-Old Wilson Place, Cornwall, who lives near Wilson Place, first received to be the first person in town to have sighted and photographed a UFO.

Above is the proof, substantiated by Paul Wilson of Giddes Lane, who also saw the flying object. Top photo shows the UFO approaching the Daniel Noel home on Wilson Place and bottom is an enlargement.

Peter told The Cornwall Local reporter that he was walking along the Argus Instamatic camera and taking in a lot below the horizon Friday when he was startled Friday while taking pictures with his camera towards him from his vicinity of the Hudson River. As he snapped the picture, it seemed to cause momentarily enough for him to

merten said the UFO appeared to be about 15 feet across, hovering at a height of 50 feet and was bluish gray in color, but did not glow as some flying saucers were reported to do. Where they were sighted in Warwick and other areas. After he got his shot of the flying saucer, it moved to the west, sailed south and then with increased speed, took off and disappeared over the West Mountain horizon. The youth did not mention his age to anyone until he developed the film in his darkroom and showed it to his teacher at the Cornwall Central High School darkroom, so that he would have a witness to the event. According to the show, Pete views it was the real thing and not a garbage can lid or something else.

    it moved behind: WASN'T DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON
                   BEHIND A RIDGE OF HILLS

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
    (Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell what
    in front of:   WHEN IT MOVED IN FRONT OF STARS

17. Tell us a few words the following things about the object:
    a. Sound:     DIDN'T NOTICE NOW.
    b. Color:     WHITE, SEEN ABOUT TO APPEAR LIGHT.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick of arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
    ALL OF IT.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
    NO DEFINITE FORM. IT APPEARED AS A LIGHT OR ELECTRIC BULB WOULD IN A DARK ENDED ROOM.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 30 3 67

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I first noticed it in the nite sky because it was so much brighter than the surrounding stars. I pointed it out to my parents and they said "no" but were curious of it because of its bright ness. We continued to watch it and suddenly it moved to another point in the sky, and remained there for several seconds. This action was repeated several times in the ten minutes we watched it be sure it disappeared back the horizon.

During this time when it moved about it would sometimes move very fast, and at other times relatively slow. The brightness of it also changed. Sometimes very bright, and sometimes quite dim. Both of these motions didn't seem to have any set pattern.

Both my parents and myself are definitely sure it was not a conventional aircraft.
