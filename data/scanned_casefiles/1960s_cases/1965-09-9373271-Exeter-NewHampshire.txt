(1) At this time have been unable to arrive at a probable cause of this sighting. The three observers seem to be stable personnel, especially the two patrolmen. I viewed the area of the sighting and found nothing in the area that could be the probable cause. PEASE AFB had 5 B-47 aircraft flying in the area during this period but do not believe they had any connection with this sighting.

THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS SIGHTING INDICATES IT WAS APPARENTLY MADE UP OF TWO DISTINCT PARTS OR OBJECTS WHICH WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND WHICH MOVED IN TANDEM OVER A SHORT SPACE OF TIME. ON 29 SEPTEMBER 1965 A YOUNG AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATOR RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT UNKNOWN OBJECTS HAD BEEN SIGHTED OVER THE EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE AREA DURING THE PREVIOUS EVENING, SEPTEMBER 28TH. DETAILS OF THE INITIAL SITING WERE OBTAINED AND IT WAS DECIDED TO CONDUCT AN IMMEDIATE ON-THE-SPOT INVESTIGATION. THIS INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT THE NEXT DAY, SEPTEMBER 29TH, BY THE AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATOR. HIS REPORT INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS SIGHTED APPEARED AS TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS WHICH HOVERED OVER THE EXETER AREA FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME, MOVED AROUND, AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. SEPARATE SIGHTINGS WERE MADE BY AT LEAST THREE OBSERVERS IN THE EXETER AREA DURING THE PERIOD 9:00 PM TO 12:00 MIDNIGHT ON SEPTEMBER 28TH. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE OBSERVERS WERE RESPONSIBLE RELIABLE CITIZENS WHO HAD NO APPARENT REASON TO MAKE UP OR DISTORT THEIR ACCOUNTS. THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE OBJECTS WERE CONSISTENT AND CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATOR DETERMINED ON HIS ARRIVAL IN EXETER THE NEXT DAY. BASED ON ALL THE INFORMATION OBTAINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN WERE SIGHTED OVER THE EXETER AREA DURING THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 28, 1965.

CLOSE SIGHTING BY POLICE AND OTHERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: Among the inexplicable sightings is this one in New Hampshire. It reportedly occurred on the 3rd of September 1965. The incident is described by a man named Norman Muscarello. He stated that he had hitchhiked home from his job and while walking along a busy highway, he said the desk officer told him that a huge, glowing object with flashing lights was hovering over a field. He immediately went to the spot and saw the object, which he described as oval-shaped and quite different from any aircraft he had ever seen. The object was about 40-50 feet in diameter and about 40 feet off the ground. It was hovering and flashing intermittently. Two other policemen and several civilians also observed the object. The object suddenly vanished as quickly as it had appeared. The tremendous commotion and kicking at the police station were unprecedented.

THERE WAS AN ABOUT 100 FEET AWAY, PART OF DID-U-CLOSE I'T, IT CAN BE SEEN HOW HIGH IT WAS. HOVERING WITH NO SOUND BUT VERY LOW, ABOUT 2000 FEET UP.

NEWSPAPER PEOPLE AND TOWN OFFICIALS WERE ALL THERE TO SEE IT. NOW THAT IT IS ALL OVER WE ARE STILL DISCUSSING IT: THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN IT EITHER. IT WAS LOCKED UP AND PUT AWAY. THE STORY IS ON THE POLICE BLOTTER, 'SAID THE OFFICER."

Text from the document:

December 23, 1965

Doctor Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Since we have not heard from you since our letter of December 27, we are writing this to request some information about the report that we sent in to you on September 3rd. We have not as yet received any acknowledgment that we have just seen stars or planets, or high altitude aircraft.

As we mentioned in our letter to you, it could not be classified as the usual type of unidentified flying object. It was a much larger and slower moving object, and it may not even have been the same as others that have been reported in the past. 

As you know, we are all familiar with all the 3-47's and B-52's, and other conventional types of aircraft, and we are quite familiar with the manners and flight characteristics of all kinds of aircraft. This was quite different, and it is our sincere feeling that it is not some kind of conventional aircraft that could have been in the air at that time.

What concerns us the most is that many people are quite upset and disturbed over the sighting, and incidentally, unless we are able to furnish them with some kind of explanation, it creates a great deal of rumors and speculation on the part of the public. Will you please let us hear from you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Patrolman Eugene Bertrand
Patrolman
Exeter, New Hampshire

Mobley's Report: Do We Have Visitors from Outer Space?
BY JACK MOBLEY

WILLARD LIBBY, Nobel prize winner, former University of Chicago professor, new Dean of the School of Engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles, stated in the September Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that "it is my considered belief that life on other stellar systems is very common".

The report describes an unidentified flying object sighted in Exeter, New Hampshire on September 3, 1965. It was reported by a columnist, Exeter police officers, and others. The object was described as bright red and flashing. It made a buzzing sound and performed maneuvers. The police officers tried to approach it but it moved away quickly.

The report also mentions an earlier sighting on the same date in Exeter, where an unidentified object was spotted by a woman. It was described as silvery and wobbling. When police arrived, the object had disappeared.

The report includes statements from the officers involved, including Officer Bertrand who described the object and his attempt to approach it. It also mentions that there was no noise or wind associated with the object.

UFOs PANIC POLICE, MOTORISTS
In the last few months, the public has been alerted to sightings of UFOs. Suddenly confronted with these strange objects in the sky, some people have become panicky and even frightened. Motorists have called the police to report UFOs hovering over their cars at speeds up to 700 m.p.h. (Copy of report attached).
Some of these sightings have been confirmed, but some of the reports from the public appear to be the result of alarming illusions caused by certain atmospheric conditions and other factors. However, some of the sightings reported, especially at close range, do warrant careful investigation.
That an Exeter, New Hampshire, 18-year-old Exeter Youth, Norman J. Muscarello, was frightened when he encountered a brilliantly lighted object, estimated to be 40 feet in diameter, hovering a few feet off the ground, is not surprising. Muscarello said the object seemed to be larger than the full moon and was illuminated with red, green, and blue lights, which pulsated in a strange pattern. He watched it for about 15 minutes before it shot straight up out of sight.
After seeing the strange object, Muscarello hurried to the nearest police station and reported what he had seen. His report was taken seriously and two officers were sent to investigate. They, too, saw the object hovering over the countryside near the police station. The two policemen were so frightened by the object that they called for assistance from neighboring towns. (Continued on page 3, column 1)

silence of the thing."
Further confirmation came from the testimony of Mrs. Clyde Lever, whose home the Muscarello sighting was made. She told how, on September 2nd, between 9:30 and 10 p.m., she watched a brilliant light cross the sky over her home and at a distance. This was about four hours previous to the sighting by the police in the same area.
Also, shortly before Muscarello's arrival at the Exeter police station, a phone call by SAUCER WATCH to the Air Force UFO spokesman had revealed that the sighting by the two policemen is UNKNOWN.
Officer Bertrand talked to led woman parked in an automobile just prior to the arrival of the police and asked her if they needed help. Jr told him that, as she was driving from nearby Epping, U.S.., she did circle her car, giving off a brilliant red glow. She went on to say that it dived at her car several times before departing. Unfortunately, the woman did not take the names of these women, so they cannot be reached as additional evidence to the already impressive file we now have on the case.
The two police officers and several other people were greeted by Force officers from Pease Air Force Base. The policemen were told to turn the incident from the press, so as to "avoid alarming the local public" was too late, as several reporters already had the story. Then later, that an Air Force officer went to stores selling the Manchester Leader - containing the story - and bought up all the copies, of course denied.
A phone call by SAUCER WATCH to the Air Force UFO spokesman had revealed that the sighting by the two policemen is classified as an UNKNOWN.
Our thanks to researcher Hélène Robinson of Sales, Kansas on the above drafting, as well as far most of the information in this case.

UFO INVESTIGATOR (PHOTO ATTACHED FROM PAGE 1)

He was white, with fear, and hardly able to talk." Desk Officer RICHARDSON related that while on patrol, he and Patrolman HUNT observed a brilliant, solid, blue-white object hovering over the field. They watched it for several minutes, and it seemed to be about 30 feet off the ground. The object then shot upwards at a fantastic speed, and disappeared from view. The two officers notified their superiors, and other patrols were sent to the area to search for the object, but they could not find it.

EXETER, N.H. - SEPT 3, 1965: 

Witness was JOHN McCLOUD, a 50-year old salesman. He reported seeing a 30 to 40 foot diameter object hovering about 200 feet off the ground. It was described as round in shape, with a row of bright lights around the edge. After hovering for a few seconds, the object shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared.

The witnesses stated that the UFO was solid, and moved in "a fantastic manner."

I was particularly interested in the report as I had been informed immediately after the incident by a friend that he had seen these strange objects, it is of interest to note that descriptions given by various persons were consistent as to size color and shape of the objects. One merchant told me that several callers had inquired about these objects after they had seen some mention of them in the Portsmouth HERALD. I found that an Air Force Officer had already interviewed a number of persons who had sighted the UFO's. Along intensive investigation of the incidents is being conducted by the Air Force.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 3 SEP 65

Important New England Sighting
By Dan Lloyd

This unusual sighting occurred near Exeter, New Hampshire on the evening of September 3, 1965. The sighting was reported by several witnesses, including Patrolman Eugene Bertrand of the Exeter Police Station.

This event, which lasted for perhaps 45 minutes, was witnessed by a number of reliable persons from different locations around Exeter. Unappily it is too long for presentation here in its original form, but it is deemed advisable to publish a summary, with the permission of the editor, of October 3, 1965.

THIS unusual sighting occurred near Exeter, New Hampshire on the evening of September 3, 1965. four extraordinarily bright red pulsating lights were seen hovering low in the sky. According to Patrolman Eugene Bertrand of the Exeter Police Station, this sighting was first observed about 12:30 A.M. by a youth who had been riding along Route 101 for 12 miles by a tractor-trailer truck. The youth, according to Bertrand, was "pretty shook up" when he reported it to the police station.

Approximately half an hour after this event, Patrolman Bertrand and Patrolman Cocklin were cruising along Route 101 when Bertrand observed the same phenomenon. "There were four pulsating red lights hovering very low over the treetops," Bertrand said. "I pulled the cruiser to the side of the road and Cocklin and I observed the lights for at least 10 to 15 minutes." Bertrand radioed the station that they were sending the cruiser to investigate and that the lights appeared to be about 300 yards away and over an open field. When the cruiser arrived at the scene, the lights had traveled to a point over some trees, where they hovered for a few minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared.

DURING this period, Patrolman Bertrand stated, the lights appeared to fluctuate in brightness and pulsate. He emphasized that the lights were red in color and extraordinarily bright, even brighter than a car spotlight. The sighting was also observed from several other locations around Exeter, and Bertrand said he knew of at least four other independent witnesses. The sighting was also observed for a few minutes by a woman at a nearby residence, who stated that the lights appeared to be about 300 yards from her home. She too said they were very bright and pulsating.

Soon after the sighting, a local resident, Reginald Prescott, telephoned the Exeter Police Station. He stated that at about 1:45 a.m. he had seen some lights in the sky. He was quite shaken and frightened, according to Bertrand. Prescott stated that the lights had hovered over his home for several minutes, then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared. Bertrand was unable to get any details from Prescott about the size, shape or other characteristics of the lights he had seen. The Prescott sighting was apparently independent of the earlier one observed by Bertrand and Cocklin.

Officer Bertrand stated that he flashed his cruiser spotlight back and forth. Muscarello signaled the lights several times, but there was no apparent response. The lights appeared to be a large, dark object, carrying a straight line of lights.

WIDESPREAD UFO REPORTS IN SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE

KENSINGTON, N.H. - An unusual report of a flying object observed overhead by several people, including police officers, in a field just outside this town, was received here.

A farmer, Norman Muscarello, informed the police that a strange, large, red object with flashing lights hovered over his barn for about 15 minutes toward midnight.

Muscarello was returning to his farm at about 2:30 a.m. when he saw the object. He said it was about 40-50 feet in diameter and brightly lighted. When he attempted to approach it, the object rose silently and quickly. 

He immediately notified the police, who responded. Three officers in a patrol car said they saw the object hovering over some trees and the barn. It then shot straight up and disappeared from sight.

Similar reports of other people having seen the object were received from this area. The descriptions were similar, describing a large, round, red-orange object with flashing lights.

On subsequent nights, other residents reported seeing strange objects in the sky, and the two nights later the police received another call about an unidentified flying object hovering over a nearby area. However, when they arrived the object had disappeared.

During the investigation it was learned that another resident, an airline pilot, had seen a similar object while driving in the area a week earlier.

TDJW/UFO
Request for UFO Information

Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)

1. We have delayed our reply to Mrs. Hunt's letter concerning the Exeter, New Hampshire sightings of 3 and 12 September 1965. This investigation from the U.S. Air Force Base was submitted to our office on 15 September 1965 and continued statements from local residents. This case has apparently caused considerable public interest in the sightings refueling area. The "Trapper" and refueling area "Down Wind" was observed intermittently during this period and was under constant observation from the controller over this refueling area and we were informed that they were closed from 03/15/65 to 03/30/65 for military operations. Our investigation indicates that these aircraft were of a military nature and the sightings were caused by the normal operation of the refueling.

2. The initial information of an object aircraft from the 4th Air Force operation "Big Blast" was the cause of the lights observed during this incident. The Air Force indicates that aircraft from "Big Blast" were refueling and apparently the air crews found the refueling area interesting and illuminated these aircraft for a possible evaluation or inspection.

3. The earlier sightings of two unidentified women and those of the Air Force tankers from Operation "Big Blast" cannot be specifically identified. 2 A. M. are regarded as UNIDENTIFIED. It is requested that you send a copy of their reply to these gentlemen.

RECENT SAUCER SIGHTING
This report concerns the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Exeter, New Hampshire on the evening of September 3, 1965. The report details the sighting by several witnesses and their observations of the object's behavior and movements.

RECENT SAUCER SIGHTING 
In the early evening of September 3, 1965, while on routine patrol in the Exeter, New Hampshire area, Patrolman Eugene Bertrand and Patrolman Gordon MacDonald of the Exeter Police Department observed a large, brightly lit object in the sky near the Exeter-Hampton line. The object appeared to be metallic in nature, approximately 40 feet in diameter, and was emitting a brilliant white light from its underside. The object was observed to hover motionless for a period of time, then accelerate at a high rate of speed, make an abrupt change in direction, and finally disappear from sight.

Gentlemen:

Based on the additional information you submitted to our UFO investigation office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, your report regarding an object observed on September 3, 1965 has been reviewed.

I hope this will help to identify the object you observed over Exeter, New Hampshire.

In 19 years of investigating over 10,000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proven that most sightings are either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or meteoric activity.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force and for your subsequent cooperation regarding the report. Agents may inconvenience you may have suffered as a result.

Sincerely,

JOHN E. SPAULDING

RADE (CASE)
ACTL: MAJOR BURNSIDE

1. References your request for information on the Exeter, 
New Hampshire UFO sighting occurring 3 September 1965. A summary 
of the case is as follows:

2. The sighting was made on the morning of 3 September 1965. 
Police authorities in Exeter, New Hampshire following wide spread publicity in the 
local newspapers regarding the New Hampshire UFO reports. A copy of the 
Exeter Police Department log covering the period from 6 and 7 September are included 
in the case file. Information to the initial report regarding description 
of the object, number of witnesses, and other pertinent data are contained 
in a summary evaluation of the sighting. The general description 
of the sighting indicates that numerous observers at various locations in 
the Exeter area observed a brightly lighted object or objects which they 
termed as "UFOs". On 3 September, an investigation 
was conducted to obtain a specific account of those events. Interviews 
conducted indicate that an 8th Air Force operation "Big Blast" was conducted in 
the Pease APB/Seacoast area and 3-17 aircraft from Pease AFB were 
involved. The Operations officer from Pease AFB and Patrolman Bertrand and Hunt 
and others from the Hig 8th Air Force indicated that this was a scheduled training 
mission and that the "bright objects" observed were normal aircraft lights at 
local time. The major portion of the sighting occurred sub-
sequent to the cease fire. Analysis of the Saturday Review of 
24 February 1966 issue, further stimulated public interest in this incident.
Under closer examination with project consultants, it was evident that there 
was a telephone call made to J.L. Shake, Director AF Scientific Advisory
Board, concerning the annual observation over Exeter and also to determine if 
astra-red photography was being conducted in the vicinity. Project consultants 
stated in the interview that two previous occasions on 14 February 1966 indicated
periodic of the unidentified flying object report. His statement 
regarding night photography is inconclusive. Copies are included.

Unidentified Flying Objects

Directorate of Information
9170 Air Division (SAC)
Eglin AFB, New Hampshire 03803

1. Reports which have been received by our organization from individuals in the Exeter, New Hampshire area indicate operation of high-speed, maneuverable objects in the vicinity of that reporting area. Investigation with the exception of the Exeter, New Hampshire report was made. Following analysis of our investigation, no definitive evidence of a positive nature was established to indicate other than normal flight operation. The operations being reported seem to warrant a further "Far Trappers" refueling area and Down Date" refueling operation. It is our belief that aircraft for this operation and various other national air defense purposes are not involved with the operational activity being reported in this area.

2. AFR 200-2 specifically states that only those objects which are undeniably associated with the operation. Therefore, balloons, satellites, aircraft, etc. are not covered by this regulation and such identification may be released. The sighting is not evaluated as a "known or conventional object" when in our opinion the reliability of the observer or other pertinent information is not
adequate to support that conclusion. The release of such information is not
permitted.

3. Investigation or unidentified flying object reports is made only in those cases where the observer contacts the Air Force directly. Information is not interchanged with any other governmental agencies as rumors are carefully considered.

4. The Air Force does not, as a rule, provide speakers to private groups on the subject of UFOs. Past experience has indicated that talks on this subject only serve to generate additional requests for speakers and create additional interest in the subject.

Capt David Moody called Griffis AFB, N York and talked with Sgt Bunt, 416 SW of the 402nd Operations Squadron. Informed that Farmer Boy refusing route had been changed to our Trapper. Records showed that no refueling operations were conducted on the nights of 3-3 Sep and 6 Sep. The route was closed from 03/0500 to 03/0500 for an 8th Air Force Operation "Big Blast".

Sgt Bunt informed Capt Moody that a refueling area west near "Dryden" controlled at Loring AFB, paralleled "Eur-Trapper" adjacent to the old Farmer Boy area. Sgt Moody called Col Smith at Loring AFB. No flights were conducted on the morning of 3 Sep and when Loring entered the speedway refueling area near Indianapolis at 07/0110Z, there were no refueling operations in this new England area during the time in question.

Any information on "Big Blast" should be obtained from Capt Moody. He did the 15th scene wing USAF at Hanscom. Records show DOCO authorized this operation on 31 Aug 65 and records confirm this information.

The above was accomplished by telephone on 22 September 1965."

EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
3 SEPTEMBER 1965

One observer was hitch-hiking on Route 101 at 02:15 when he observed a bright red light appear over a group of trees about 1/4 mile away from where he was standing. The lights were in a line as if attached to an object and they were so bright they lit up the area. Only one light would disappear at a time. Observers watched these lights for approximately 15 minutes until they finally disappeared behind some trees and seemed to go into the distance. At one time the objects came so close that observer jumped into a ditch from being frightened by what he had seen.

Second observer arrived at Police Station after contact with woman in a car who claimed a light had been following her and stopped her for some time before moving on over the field.

Third observer arrived after having been called by second observer. He observed the lights which were still over the field, out toward the horizon. As he watched, the lights started to move around over the field. The lights were so bright it was difficult to make out any distinct shape. There was no sound or vibration but the farm animals nearby were upset and scared. When the lights started coming near again, the observer ran for his car.

- page 50 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

AS BEFORE. The lights moved out across the field at an estimated speed of 100 feet and finally disappeared in the distance at the same altitude. The lights were always at about 450 angle. When the object and the lower lights were abreast of the observers, the lower lights were always observed of the others... Local time of the observation was approximately two hours. 

COMMENTS
The general description of flashing lights is consistent with reports of aircraft, refuelling operations or low level photographic air force operations in the area. An investigation was made as to the possibility of aircraft in the area at the time of the observation. The Air Force "Big blasts" was indicated in the New England area at aircraft (from Pease AFB) were between 22:34 and 23:33 local time. The description does not fit normal aircraft operations although several reports world wide have been received of similar objects and reports, presumed to be aircraft, were evaluated, was the preliminary impression of the investigator.

The preliminary impression was that the lights were the cause of the sightings. These aircraft were in the traffic pattern at Pease AFB between 22:34 and 23:33, which does not correspond to the time observation. Since no aircraft can be identified as the Air Force, the case is listed as unidentified by the Air Force.

PEACE AIR FORCE BASE
OFFICE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS INVESTIGATIONS
Dear Sir:
In light of the recent reports of U.F.O. sightings, I have been disturbed by the contents of your report. While these sightings have become more numerous, I am concerned about the lack of concrete evidence to substantiate their veracity. 
On the night of 28 June 1965, around the time of 7:30 P.M., several objects were sighted over Exeter, New Hampshire. These objects were described as being metallic in appearance, and it was noted that they seemed to be hovering and maneuvering in the night sky. While I understand the interest and excitement surrounding such phenomena, I must caution that hasty conclusions should not be drawn. The reports indicate that the objects were heavily clouded and were very low in the sky, which could potentially lead to misidentification. I would strongly urge that a more thorough investigation be conducted before any definitive statements are made.
Furthermore, I am concerned about the reports of civilian witnesses claiming to have seen these objects. It is my belief that such sightings are more likely the result of misidentification or overactive imaginations than any tangible phenomenon. I would encourage you to be more skeptical of such accounts and to seek out more reliable sources of information.
In closing, I would like to reiterate my concern about the lack of concrete evidence to support the claims made in your report. While I do not wish to dismiss the possibility of unidentified flying objects, I believe that a more measured and scientific approach is necessary. I hope that you will take these concerns into consideration as you continue your investigations.
I hope this will aid your investigations.
Sincerely,

Text extracted from the document:

At ap 12:40 p.m., at a local airport, near Exeter, New Hampshire, several persons observed in the sky an unusual object. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and was described as being cigar-shaped, with a dark center and light colored ends. The object appeared to be hovering and drifting to the south. Individuals who observed this object included airport personnel and local citizens. Photographs were taken of the object.

Dear sir,
I should have written this letter to you sooner, but I had so much work to do that I just never seemed to get around to it. On the evening of August 3, 1965, my wife and I were driving along route 101 in new hampshire near the town of exeter. It was about 11:37 p.m. and we were traveling west toward the newfields-exeter area. As we drove along, my wife suddenly exclaimed, "Look at that!" When I glanced up, I saw a large brightly lighted object moving rapidly through the sky. It appeared to be round and was giving off a bluish-white light. The object moved silently and very swiftly, in a straight line, and was visible for about 10 to 15 seconds before it disappeared from view. My wife and I continued driving and shortly afterwards saw the object again, this time hovering over a field near the road. We stopped the car and watched it for a few minutes. The object seemed to be about the size of a car and was surrounded by a glowing halo of light. After a short time, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. We resumed our trip and did not see the object again. I have never seen anything like this before and I am quite puzzled by what we observed. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with any information or explanation regarding this incident. Please let me know if you have any questions or require any additional details from me. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,

The night of September 3, 1965, at about 1:30 a.m., several residents of Exeter, New Hampshire, observed a large object in the sky which appeared to be the size of an automobile. The object had a brilliant light and seemed to be hovering a few hundred feet above the ground. At one point it appeared to be only a few feet off the ground and then slowly ascended and moved away. After some investigation, the object was lost from sight.

the Carsweli Air Force Base. Several days later Exeter Police and the New Hampshire State Police in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico, each had received a large number of observations, corroborating the original sightings of a large object maneuvering over Exeter. 

On the night of 3 September, the New Hampshire State Police in Exeter reported that a large number of sightings had been recorded, including an unidentified object hovering over a gravel pit near the town of Exeter. Bertrand said a he had seen the object and went out with his cruising.

While that was going on, another officer, Sergeant Eugene Bertrand, of the Exeter police force. said the object then went from a position near the town of Exeter to the northwest, hesitated, and went on toward Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

This was substantiated, said Bertrand, by several other officers of the Exeter police force. He said during the time this object was being observed, the usual evening traffic and activity were diminished, as people were standing in the streets and roads. watching the phenomenon. They reported to him that this object had gone from the gravel pit near the town of Exeter, to Portsmouth, hesitated, and then continued its flight toward the north-northwest.

Bertrand said there was another incident involving the Carswell Air Force Base. Several days later Exeter Police and the New Hampshire State Police in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico, each had received a large number of observations, corroborating the original sightings of a large object maneuvering over Exeter.

It was also reported that these sightings were made concurrently with those in the Exeter area."

REPORT

On 3 September 1965, at approximately 2300 hours, a young married couple was driving south on Route 101 in Exeter, New Hampshire. As they approached the intersection of Route 101 with Hampton Road, they observed an unusual light in the sky to the north of their position. The light appeared to be very large, brightly illuminated, and was moving slowly in a west to east direction at an altitude estimated to be about 1,000 feet.

The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and was surrounded by a glowing, white, hazy aura. As the object moved across the sky, it appeared to occasionally increase or decrease in brightness. The witnesses observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from view to the east.

After the object disappeared, the witnesses continued driving and shortly thereafter, they noticed that the automobile engine was malfunctioning. The engine was running very rough and the headlights were dimming. The witnesses were able to pull the car off the road and the engine returned to normal operation within a few minutes.

The witnesses provided a detailed description of the object and their observations to the Exeter Police Department. An investigation was conducted, but no satisfactory explanation for the sighting was determined.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
EASTING. CASE PEXTO
9 September 1065
I. SUMMARY OP SIGHTING:
On the night of 3 September 1965, at approximately 9:30 p.m., two police officers observed an unidentified flying object over Exeter, New Hampshire. The object was described as a lgrge, bright light which hovered for several minutes and then suddenly moved, accelerating at a very high rate of speed. 
II. INVESTIGATION:
A. Detailed Eyewitness Accounts:
1. Patrolman Eugene Bertrand, Exeter, New Hampshire Police Department. Patrolman Bertrand stated that at approximately 9:30 p.m. on 3 September 1965, he was driving his patrol car on Route 101 near the town of Exeter when he observed a large, bright light in the sky to the north. The light appeared to be hovering and Patrolman Bertrand stopped his car to observe it more closely. He stated that the light was brighter than any of the stars in the sky and that it remained stationary for several minutes. Suddenly, the light accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within a few seconds.
2. Patrolman David Hunt, Exeter, New Hampshire Police Department. Patrolman Hunt, who was on patrol with Patrolman Bertrand, corroborated Patrolman Bertrand's account of the sighting. Patrolman Hunt stated that he also observed the large, bright light in the sky and that it appeared to be hovering. He stated that the light suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds.
III. CONCLUSION:
Based on the detailed eyewitness accounts provided by the two police officers, it appears that an unidentified flying object was sighted over Exeter, New Hampshire on the night of 3 September 1965. The object was described as a large, bright light which hovered for several minutes before accelerating at a very high rate of speed and disappearing from sight. No satisfactory explanation for the sighting has been determined.

Text Output:
During the observation period, two bright lights were observed above the beach moving toward the vertical light. These appeared to be about the same size as the original object, but as they joined, there appeared to be three lights to the original object. These lights then left the larger object at times, ranging low over the water, disappearing at times only to reappear. The night was clear with no wind.
Mrs. MacGillvary did call the Coast Guard the next day, reporting that something had disappeared that week. The answer to her question remains unexplained.
The night was clear with no wind. The moon was not seen. Several persons involved, although some parties were involved, said they could hear no sound.
Mr. and Mrs. MacGillvary were both most cooperative and they would be glad to discuss any details in the future if necessary submitted.

Dear Ray:

The following report concerns the sighting of September 3, 1966, by Mr. and Mrs. E. MacGillvary, 30 Island Park Road, Wenham, Massachusetts. The witnesses appeared to be serious and cooperative according to the attached forms. The witnesses mentioned that they had not been able to see things of this nature before and that they were completely taken by surprise by the occurrence.

The following is a general summary of the information as I pieced it together from the report forms. Also enclosed is a copy of the sketch made of the object as it was seen.

On September 17, Saturday evening at approximately 8:15 P.M., the witnesses saw in the western sky a bright light which is described as having a rotating effect. It was at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 3,000 feet and in a northwesterly direction. It hovered for about half an hour, i.e., the activity both from inside the house and from outside the house. The object first sighted was an elongated cigar shape, sometimes dim and then bright enough to see that it was a long shape and apparently had a fog-like effect extending for a distance. It appeared to be several hundred feet long by about a 50 foot wide. As it became light outside, the object appeared to be a dotted line effect extending from the ground at a 45 degree angle. This object was observed for a period of over an hour.

TRANSCRIPT:

THE EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE INCIDENT
September 3, 1965

The town of Exeter is located in the southeast part of New Hampshire, just a few miles from the Atlantic Ocean. The town itself is relatively small, with a population of around 8,000 people. On the evening of September 3, 1965, a number of local residents reported seeing strange lights and objects in the sky over Exeter.

The first reports came from two local police officers, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, who were on patrol that night. They reported seeing a large, glowing object in the sky, which made several rapid maneuvers and changes in direction. Other witnesses, including local residents, also reported seeing similar objects and lights in the sky.

The incident generated a great deal of interest and speculation, both locally and nationally. The Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was responsible for investigating reports of unidentified flying objects, became involved in the investigation. Interviews were conducted with the witnesses, and attempts were made to identify the objects and determine their nature.

The details of the Exeter incident, including the witness accounts, the investigation by Project Blue Book, and the ongoing debate and speculation about the nature of the objects, are documented in various reports and records from the time period.

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
THE OBJECT IS DESCRIBED AS BEINGVISIBLE 10: 12 -1.0:20 PM ON SEPT 3, 1965 IN THE SKIES OVER EXETER, NH. OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY MANY WITNESSES, INCLUDING POLICE AND CIVILIANS. IT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE RAPID MOVEMENTS, HOVER, AND CHANGE DIRECTIONS ABRUPTLY. OBJECT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF CONTROLLED FLIGHT.

EVALUATION:
A CREDIBLE REPORT. SIGHTINGS OF THIS TYPE HAVE BEEN REPORTED FREQUENTLY OVER THE YEARS, ALTHOUGH THEY DEFY EASY EXPLANATION. SIGHTINGS INDICATE THAT SOME UNKNOWN, UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ARE REAL, BUT THEIR ORIGIN AND NATURE REMAIN A MYSTERY.

The person reported seeing a "flying object" which he thought was a "flying disc". He said it was larger than a plane and flew at a high rate of speed. He described the object as being shaped like a "twin-motored aircraft". The document seems to be a report or account of this sighting.

Mr. Eugene F. Bertrand Jr.
Mr. David R. Hunt
Exeter Police Department
Exeter, New Hampshire

Gentlemen,

The sighting of various unidentified objects by you and Mrs. Eugene F. Bertrand Jr. on 3 September 1965 near Exeter, New Hampshire, and their report has been forwarded to this office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This incident has attracted considerable publicity through various news media, and Mr. Bertrand has been queried further by my investigators for additional information. This information was released by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and Mr. Bertrand was asked to confirm the details, which he did, as is customary. As a result of this activity, the Air Force has received inquiries on the case.

Our investigation and evaluation of this sighting indicates no logical association with an Air Force operation. The objects observed were not known types of aircraft flying in the area, and we have no record of any military air activity during this time period either. While unobserved by personnel engaged in this project, the reports of unidentified objects continued over a considerable period and their actions were not typical of normal aircraft. Since the objects in question did not affect the safety of any aircraft operations, we might consider this of scientific interest only. However, this type of occurrence on a recurring basis does require our attention.

Sincerely,

H.E. QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

"Dear Bill:
Some interesting things happened the night of Sept. 3 in Exeter, N.H.
At about 3:00 AM Patrolman Bertrand Brassard observed a bright reddish-orange object in the night sky. It was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter and it was traveling in a north to south direction. At one point it came to a complete stop for about 30 seconds and then proceeded on its southerly course at a tremendous rate of speed. 
At about 4:30 AM the object was again sighted, this time by Patrolman Eugene Bertrand near Rt. 101 and Epping Rd. He watched the object for about 20 minutes. It moved very slowly at first, then picked up speed and headed northwest at a terrific rate of speed. At one point it hovered over the area for a few minutes then took off. 
At 10:26 PM the same night, September 3rd, the object was again seen by both Patrolmen heading northeast at a fast rate of speed."

Text from the document:

We would both appreciate it very much if you would help us wherever possible. Unfortunately, the problem is a very delicate one and there are many people involved. Anything you can do along this line would be very much appreciated. We appreciate the problems the Air Force must have with a lot of irresponsible reports on this subject, and we want you to know that we fully understand your position. Thanks very much for your interest. Sincerely,

Edward J. Ruppelt

MANCHESTER (N.H.) UNION "LEADER" - Monday, September 6, 1965
POLICE, CIVILIANS SIGHT UFO IN EXETER AREA
EXETER - An unidentified flying object, witnessed here by at least four policemen and several civilians, hovered over the police station from 2:36 a.m. to 3:10 a.m. today, it was reported.
Exeter police station, at 2:45 a.m., received a call that an object was "hovering over the town." Officer Eugene Bertrand answered the call, and he reported that the object was "definitely not an airplane or a helicopter." The object, which gave off a bright red glow, moved over the town and then headed in a southwesterly direction.
Tapping strange activities, a police car with three patrolmen was dispatched to investigate the sighting. The car followed the object for some distance at a high rate of speed, but it then disappeared. 
According to the report, the object was seen and described by four policemen and several civilians. The object was said to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was estimated to be 50 to 75 feet off the ground at the closest point. The object was described as having a bright red light or glow at the top and a white light from the bottom. The object made no noise and moved very quickly and silently. 
One of the most amazing features, according to the report, was that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, as it would move away whenever the police car approached it.
The police station in Hampton also received a telephone call about the sighting, and it reported that a similar object had been seen in that area.

December 2, 1965

Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

We were very glad to get your letter during the third week in November regarding the sighting of some unidentified flying objects which occurred during the evening of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Pl. Hunt and I had submitted reports on this sighting to your office and evidently you had received them. 

From the context, it seems both the observers were an airline pilot and a commercial pilot, and the sightings occurred at around 9:00 PM on September 3, 1965. The sightings lasted for several minutes and the objects exhibited characteristics that suggested they were not conventional aircraft. The letter discusses the observers' opinions and concludes that the sightings were "no illusion" and that "what we were seeing was the complete official story."

The letter also mentions that a Captain (Bartman?) was in the Air Force and witnessed the same objects, and that the objects disappeared in a way that made it impossible to determine what they were. Another fact mentioned is that the observation period lasted nearly 2:00 AM, between midnight and 2:00 AM, and that the observers reported the sightings to the police station before being interviewed.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

On the 3rd of September 1965, a group of five persons appeared over a house and lot about 500 yards South West of Exeter, N.H. at 0200 hours on the 3rd of September. As they approached, a house cat was frightened and ran into the house. The lights were so bright they lighted up about 50 degree angle. They were so bright they appeared to be over a large field and over the house for about 10-15 minutes and then disappeared. They always moved in a straight line and then reappeared. They never made any distinct form to the object, watched these lights seem to come down behind a house and then reappear. Some members of the family said they could see the outline and seemed to be oval but not distinct. This was the first time anyone had ever reported a sighting and they finally discovered what they believed to be the object and reported it to the Exeter Police Station.

The image does not contain a photograph, it shows a typewritten text titled "STATEMENT UFO Sighting". The text describes an incident observed by David R. Hunt, a patrolman, on the morning of September 3rd, 1965 near Exeter, New Hampshire. The statement details that Hunt observed a group of bright lights moving in the sky and remained at the same altitude, which he estimated to be around 100-150 feet.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, David R. Hunt, at about 0255 on the morning of the 3rd of September, received a call from Patrolman Bertrand to report to an area about 3 miles South West of Exeter, N.H. Upon arriving at the scene, I observed a group of bright lights to the South East. After observing the lights for several minutes, they began to drift off in a Northerly direction. The lights remained at the same altitude which I estimate to be about 100-150 ft.

STATEMENT  
UFO Sighting

I, Eugene P. Bertrand Jr., was cruising on the morning of September 3, 1965 at about 1:30 AM in the vicinity of Exeter, New Hampshire and stopped to investigate. I found a woman in the car who stated a light had been following her car and she had stopped to investigate.  She stated the light remained about 30 to 40 feet in the air and moved about what appeared to be intelligently and not erraticly [sic]. She stated it was red in color and she had been watching it for the past 10 minutes. I then took up a position to watch the light. I was about 75 to 100 feet away from it and able to see it clearly. It was about 30 to 40 feet in the air and appeared circular in shape, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It had a white flashing light around the outer edge and a solid red light in the center. The object would move slowly at first and then pick up speed and dart back and forth across the field. When the object moved, the white flashing lights would move extremely fast around the outer edge. I observed the object for about 16 minutes and then I heard another vehicle approaching. I went back to my car and turned on the red light to flag down the approaching vehicle. As soon as I turned the red light on, the object shot straight up in the air at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The other vehicle, which turned out to be a private citizen, stopped to assist me and also observed the object before it disappeared. The witness who first reported the incident to me also again observed the object after I turned on my red light as it shot straight up and disappeared. The entire incident lasted for approximately 20 minutes. I could not make out any definite shape or outline and the object appeared to be transparent, with only the lights visible. There was no sound whatsoever. I have no explanation for what I observed. I consider myself to be a reliable witness and would be willing to testify to what I saw.
