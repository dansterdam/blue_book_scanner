(1) At this time have been unable to arrive at a probable cause of this sighting. The three observers seem to be stable reliable persons, especially the two patrolman. I viewed the area of the sighting and found nothing in the area that could be the probable cause. Pease AFB had 5 B-47 aircraft flying in the area during this period but do not believe they had any connection with this sighting.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Directorate of Information

SUBJECT: Request for Information Concerning Speakers

TO: Information Officer
Foreign Technology Division, AFSC
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been an unusually high number of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Pease AFB, N.H. area which have been the subject of much discussion and numerous newspaper, radio and television reports. Many of these sightings have been reported to this base, and your records will show that we have performed thorough investigations of them. Other reports which we have learned of second hand have been made to local police departments, and, in a few cases, to several news media. Several members of this community have been called to view UFO's, by sincere and sober citizens, but so far we have always been too late. Naturally, the most interesting sighting occurred in the nearby town of Exeter, aroused special interest in the press, and the object at rest (perhaps) in reference to the Saturday Review of Literature in the current issue.

2. This office has, of course, not commented on sightings reported from the press. Many from our point of view have been investigated, but the reports will be sent to your organization. We suggest that the Public Information Office that handles news releases contact the Air Force, etc. The fact that we cannot comment fully on the investigation has led to some misunderstanding. I have a feeling that in some areas... the Air Force won't release the truth, because to do so would reveal sources of intelligence. I have attempted to counter this by explaining the USAF's interest in this matter.

3. Many members of the two nearby military sites committees and local citizens from surrounding towns and cities have inquired concerning the possibility of an Air Force speaker on this subject.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The sighting was made on a morning of 23 September 1965. Initial investigation was made by investigating team from the New England area. Information received in the initial report regarding description of the object and newspaper coverage was not sufficient for a firm evaluation of the sighting. The general description of fleeting lights is consistent with previous reports of aircraft refueling operations or low level photographic missions using infrared lights. On 23 September an investigation attempting to place a specific aircraft of these types over Exeter was made. Results of this investigation indicated that the Air Force operation "Big Slats" was conducted in the New England area and that aircraft from Pease AFB were also involved in the operation. Letters were written to civilian personnel and to Lt. Col. Matheson AFR, to apply additional information.

The only report available is an article from the Saturday Review and Look Magazine authored by John G. This article is essentially factual. However, it is more of a special license war correspondent type article. The only report in Agee for evaluation is a statement made by the police officers who were on the scene. These were some of the first witnesses to the aircraft.

CLOSE SIGHTING BY POLICE AND OTHERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: Among several extraordinary saucer sightings in New Hampshire in early September, is one that occurred on the 3rd, witnessed by a man named Norman Muscarello from the town of Exeter. Muscarello arrived at midnight at the local police station with a hair-raising story of having been chased by a flying object as he was hitchhiking along a nearby highway. He told the desk officer that as he was walking along the road, a large brilliant object as low as 100 feet began making passes at an adjacent field. He crouched in a ditch while the UFO, which was so brilliantly red, made close passes as if it were trying to land. Shortly thereafter the object disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.

Patrolman Bertrand of the Exeter police station returned with Muscarello to the scene. In most such cases, the story concludes with the policeman having seen nothing to corroborate the original story. The ending of this case is quite different. However, Officer Bertrand suggested that they walk into the UFO field and see what they could find. There they were joined by another policeman who had driven separately to the scene. Suddenly the officer named David Hunt, who had been traveling in the black of the night, a huge blinding light, began to see a stand of trees in a slightly frozen side glow of light appeared. It traveled slowly and was slightly from side to side. The group was stunned by the blinding red light as the UFO moved toward them across the field. Bertrand made a move toward the police cruisers.

When questioned on the size of the object, Officer Bertrand estimated it to be "about the size of a house." He said that there was a complete absence to be seen in the field of a normal animal life and sound, except for the noise from a nearby farm, where the horses were making a tremendous commotion and kicking at the walls of their stalls, according to the witnesses.

Here is the text from the document:

"WE SAT THERE AND LOOKED at it for at least 10 minutes. My brain kept telling me that this doesn't happenâ€”but it was, right in front of my eyes.

"There was no tail, no wings, and again, no SOUND. It hovered there, still about 100 feet away, sort of floated and wobbled. I don't know what it was. All I can say is that three of us saw it together."

Newspaper people and town officials vouch for the reliability of the two policemen. Lt. Cottrell, their superior, said if the two policemen he'd put them in a locked room and give 'em blocks to play with like a "blotter."

But "we were story is no blotter." said the lieutenant. "If I had seen that thing and I alone, no body else would have ever heard about it."

Dear Sir:

Since we have not heard from you since our letter to you of December 2, we are writing this to request some kind of answer, since we are still upset about what happened after the Pentagon released its news saying that we have just seen stars or planets, or high altitude air exercises.

As we mentioned in our letter to you, it could not have been the operation "Big Blast" you mention, since the time of our sighting was nearly an hour after that exercise, and it may not even have been the same date, since you refer to our sighting as September 2. Our sighting was on September 3. In addition, as we mentioned, we are both familiar with all the B-47's and B-52's and helicopter and jet fighters which are common over this place all the time. On top of that Ptl. Bertrand had four years of refueler experience in the Air Force.

We did not give aircraft of all kinds. It is important to remember that this craft we saw was not more than 100 feet in the air, and it was absolutely silent, with no rush of air from jets or chopper blades whatever. And it did not give any wings or tail. If it up the entire field, and two nearby houses turned completely red. It stopped, hovered, and turned on a dime.

What bothers us the most is that many people are thinking this was very either lying or not intelligent enough to tell the difference between what we saw and something ordinary. These other people may think we saw China, September 3, and two of them appeared to be in shock from it. This was absolutely not a case of mistaken identity.

We both feel that it's very important for our jobs and our reputations to get some kind of letter from you to say that the story which the Pentagon put out was not true; it could not possibly be, because we were the people who saw this, not the Pentagon.

Can you please let us hear from you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Mabley's Report:
Do We Have
Visitors from
Outer Space?

BY JACK MABLEY

WILLARD LIBBY, Nobel prize winner, former University of Chicago professor, now at the University of California at Los Angeles, states in the September Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that life "in all probability occurs widely in other stellar systems."

He suggests life on other planets may be millions of years more advanced than that on Earth. Later I want to do a whole column on Dr. Libby's lucid explanation of man's place in the physical universe.

The reference to Dr. Libby today is to lend some weight to the idea that there is life out there, and with a multiplying jump in our knowledge of intelligence, they just might be visiting us. We are a trying source to Mars.

Northwestern's Dr. Allen J. Hynek, air force consultant on unidentified flying objects, says people like to see things till to Dr. Hynek, one step further. People like to believe things, I find it fascinating to believe there probably are space ships flying close to earth.

EARLY IN SEPTEMBER, an unidentified flying object was reported at Exeter, N. H. John Fuller, a columnist in The Saturday Review, was curious to follow up the report. He pieced together this story:

Policeman Eugene Bertrand, on routine patrol shortly after midnight Sept. 3, pulled up beside a parked car on Route 101 and found two women visibly disturbed.

They said an airborne object, bright red and flashing, trailed them for nearly 12 miles. Bertrand, a Korean war veteran, was skeptical. He made a routine radio report, and continued his patrol.

At 2 a. m. Norman Muscarello, 18, ran into the Exeter police station in near hysteria. He said he was hitchhiking home, looked up, and saw similar object approaching him with a yawing, tilting motion. The object lighted the entire area. He threw himself against a stone wall, then ran to a farmhouse when the object sailed out of sight. After the incident, he told his story, the desk sergeant radioed Officer Bertrand and asked him to take Norman Muscarello back to the spot.

OFFICER BERTRAND SAYS: "I was sure these women and this kid had seen a helicopter, or something like that. But we went out to the spot, and I looked up. It was a clear night. No wind. No fog. We walked about 100 yards out on the field, near a barn where a lot of horses were kept. Then the kid yelled, 'There it is!'

"He was right. It was coming up over a row of trees. There was no noise at all. It was about 100 feet away from us. I could see five bright red lights in a straight row. They dimmed from right to left, and then from left to rightâ€”just like an advertising sign does.

"It lit up everything around us. But it was silent. The horses started kicking and making an awful fuss, and the kid was scared stiff.

"The kid drew in his tracks, and I grabbed him and held him. Then we both saw it. I watched for several minutes, and then thought more of it. Then Officer David Hunt ar-

UFOs PANIC POLICE, 
MOTORISTS

In the last few months, there has been a disturbing increase in public fear of UFOs. Suddenly confronted with these strange objects, veteran policemen -- formerly skeptics -- have panicked. A case in point was a Texas police officer who frankly told the AF they had raced a UFO at 100 m.p.h. (Copy of report to AF in AF file). In other verified cases, some motorists were found in a state of shock. A truck driver was terrified with a UFO came at him head-on, and other observers, here and abroad, were alarmed by UFO encounters, especially at close range.

We do not wish to add to the fear of UFOs, but the causes mentioned are already known locally. If such cases continue, police and other public officials will have to seriously add to the problem of educating the public.

A case at Exeter, N.H., Sept. 3, is a typical example of last month's UFO chase. Approaching UFO. Around 12:30 a.m., Exeter police investigated a case of near shock. The driver told Officer Eugene Bertrand he had seen a UFO. Not seeing any strange object, Bertrand reassured the driver and drove off.

Disturbing Lights

That an hour later, Norman J. Muscarello, 18-year-old Exeter youth, was walking alone Route 150 when a strange, red-lighted object came over nearby treetops. The almost blinding lights came from five extremely bright lights, which pulsated in Frightened, Muscarello crouched behind a stone wall. The UFO stopped and hovered at about 100 feet above a house near Clyde Russell's house -- at least 80-90 feet long. After the UFO slightly moved back over the trees, Muscarello ran to the Russell home and pounded on the door. But the Russells, thinking it was a drunk, refused to open.

About 1:45, Muscarello reached the Exeter Police Station, two miles from the sighting spot.

silence of the thing."

Further confirmation came from the testimony of Mrs. Clyde Russell, near whose home the Muscarello sighting was made. She told him, on the evening of September 2nd, between 9:30 and 10 p.m., she watched a brilliant red object about the size of a full moon cross the sky over her home and disappear in the distance. This was about four hours previous to the sighting by young Muscarello in the same area.

Also, shortly before Muscarello's arrival at the Exeter police station, Officer Bertrand talked to two upon parked in an automobile on Route 101, just out of town. Bertrand asked the ladies if they needed help, and the driver told him that, as she was driving from nearby Epping, N.H., a flying object had circled her car, giving off a brilliant red glow. She went on to say that it dived at her car several times before departing. Unfortunately, Bertrand did not take the names of these women, so they cannot be reached to add their evidence to the already impressive file we now have on the mysterious Exeter Case.

The two police officers and several other people were questioned by Air Force officers from Pease Force Base. The policemen were asked to keep the incident from the press, so as to "avoid alarming the local people." But it was too late, as several reporters already had the story. There was a rumor that an Air Force officer went to stores selling the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader - containing the story - and bought up all the copies. This rumor of course denied.

A phone call by SAUCER NEWS to the Air Force UFO spokesman at the Pentagon revealed that the sighting by the two policemen is carried on their books as an UNKNOWN.

Our thanks to researcher Nellie Robinson of Salem, Massachusetts, for the above drawing, as well as for most of the information in this article.

UFO PANIC (Continued from page 11)

...he was white with fear and hardly able to talk." Desk Officer Reginald Toland said later. Muscorello told Toland and Officer Bertrand the story, and through it seemed incredible, Bertrand drove him to the scene.

Muscorello and the officer walked into the field where the UFO was visible. Then as Bertrand pointed his flashlight around Muscorello shouted, and Bertrand saw around in time to see a large dark object displaying a straight row of extraordinarily bright red pulsating lights." The UFO, coming into the field at tree-top level, changed course slightly, then rose up and hovered.

Bertrand reached for his revolver, then thought better of it. Shouting for Muscorello to take cover, in the car, he also jumped into the cruiser, fearing that he might be burned by the blinding red lights. Closing in, barking furiously and horses in a nearby barn whinnying and kicking their stalls.

Brilliant red lights pulsed in a smooth sequence: 1-2-3-4-5, taking two seconds to complete a full cycle.

The sequence in which the five lights pulsated ... 1-2-3-4-5 ... 1-2-3-4-5 ... Officer Bertrand the impressions that the UFO was under intelligent control. The brilliance of the lights was so intense that Muscorello was blinded after and at closer range. The officer were not even though he could not see clearly behind the lights.

UFO Officer David B. Hunt arrived from Exeter in time to view the UFO for about six minutes. By then it was moving very slowly, with a wobbling motion, and appeared to be somewhat larger than before.

Most of a read card course, the UFO disappeared below the tree line.

After noon, Exeter police notified NICAP, and next day an interview was held. NICAP investigator Raymond Fowler also interviewed the policemen. They told him the officers also were special interest in the size and shape of the object. The policemen also said the AF men told them.

The AF shock revealed no aircraft in the area during the sighting. Most interesting of all, the police said the AF officers asked them to keep the story from the press to avoid embarrassment. Most of them seemed more curious than frightened.

"dying a cow". Before the call could be put through to the police, the telephone connection went dead. Neither the man nor the pay station could subsequently be traced.

After the police had reported the incident to Pease Air Force Base, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a USAF Major and a Lieutenant, both in uniform, arrived. They questioned the police officers, and the Lieutenant went to the field where it was said the objects had been seen. When the police were asked to keep the sighting from the press so as to avoid alarming the local people. But it was too late, for several reporters had already got hold of the story. An unconfirmed report has it that an Air Force Officer had later gone round to all the stores selling newspapers in Exeter, and bought all copies of the Manchester "Union Leader" newspaper which carried a detailed account of the sightings.

In questioning the police officers, the USAF team were particularly interested in the size and shape of the object, and whether chickens in a nearby field had been alarmed during the sighting.

It is of interest to note that for several weeks previous to the sightings, the police had received reports from people saying that their house had been momentarily illuminated by a bright reddish glow after they had gone to bed. No objects were seen.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 66

Exeter, New Hampshire
3 Sep 65

Important New England Sighting
By Dan Lloyd

This account has been condensed from a copy of a report sent to the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW by the chairman of the Massachusetts NICAP sub-committee, RAYMOND E. FOWLER. The original of the report was sent to NICAP H.Q. at 1536 Connecticut Avenue N.W. Washington D.C. 20036. A model investigation, the report provides an interesting insight into the workings of NICAP. Unhappily it is too long for presentation here in its original form, but it is worthy of note that a version of the account, with due acknowledgments to Mr. Fowler, appeared in the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH of October 3, 1965.

THIS unusual sighting occurred near Exeter, New Hampshire, on September 3, 1965. At approximately 12:30 a.m. on that date, Officer Eugene Bertrand of the Exeter Police Station came upon a woman parked on the Exeter-Hampton road, who told him excitedly that she had been chased along Route 101 for 12 miles by a flying object which was encircled with a brilliant red glow. She said that the object had dived at her car several times.

Approximately half an hour after this event, eight-year-old Norman Muscarello was walking home to now miles outside of Exeter. Alarmed to see a large dark object in the field, he was extremely bright red pulsating lights emerge from nearby woods and move over a nearby field. It hovered over a house belonging to Clyde Russell, then, as the frightened youth crawled down behind a stone wall bordering the field, it seemed to move closer toward him. Its lights were so bright that they lit up the whole area in a bright glow. The object appeared to be about 80-90 feet longâ€”much longer than the houseâ€”and was completely silent. Then it moved away and disappeared behind some trees. Muscarello tried to wake the occupants of the Russell home by pounding on the door but, thinking the boy was drunk, they refused to open the door. Muscarello finally gave up and flagged a lift to the Exeter Police Station.

Muscarello reported the incident to Desk Officer Reginald Towland at about 1:45 a.m. He was white with fear and hardly able to talk. Officer Bertrand was recalled to the station, and he picked Muscarello up, and returned with him to the scene of the incident, but the object was nowhere to be seen. However, the ground was marked in the field, and as the police officer was playing his flashlight back and forth, Muscarello sighted the object rising slowly from behind some nearby trees. He shouted a warning. Bertrand swung round and saw a large, dark object carrying a straight row of four extraordinarily bright red pulsating lights coming into the field at tree-top level. It cleared a 70-foot tree and came to within 100 feet of them. Instinctively, Officer Bertrand reached for his revolver but, thinking better of it, yelled to Muscarello to take cover in the cruiser, where Bertrand immediately put in a radio call to headquarters for assistance. Officer David R. Hunt arrived within minutes and, together, they observed the object move away beyond and below the tree line.

Altogether, the object was in view for some 10 minutes. Officer Bertrand and Norman Muscarello, and about 5 minutes by Officer Hunt when he joined them.

Pulsating Lights

The four brilliant pulsating red lights appeared to flash in a steady sequence from left to right and back again. Officer Bertrand said they were brighter than any light he had ever seen and gave Bertrand the distinct impression that this was an intelligent-controlled vehicle and definitely not some natural phenomenon. The lights were seen to be part of a large, dark, solid object, and the reflection off the object's body caused a halo effect around it.

The heard by the witnesses, even at close range, but apparently the animals in a nearby barn sensed something that frightened them, for they whinnied and kicked their stalls. A dog barked furiously. No interference was noticed on the police radio nor were the lights and ignition of the cruiser affected. The field contained no electrical equipment.

To add to the excitement, an unidentified hysterical man tried to call the police during the early hours of the morning to report a UFO. He dialled the operator and excitedly asked to be put through to the police as he had been chased by a

Widespread UFO Reports
In Southern New Hampshire

KENSINGTON, N.H. - An unidentified flying object has been reported as being sighted by at least five persons, including two police officers, here in a field off Route 150.

Early Friday morning, Norman Muscarello, 18, 205 Front St., Exeter, was walking on Route 150 in Kensington, near the residence of Carl Dining, when he said he saw a large, red object with flashing lights emerge from the woods in the rear of the Dining residence.

Muscarello, who was first viewed later, stated he was stunned and then he lay flat in the ditch until the however, the object had withdrawn. He was not the only witness. Clyde Russell, household helper at the Muscarello home, also flagged down a car and was taken to the police station. According to Officer Bertrand, he had seen the object.

David Hunt. The trio walked toward the field towards the house. Muscarello reported seeing the object materialize. Suddenly the object was hovering slowly in the sky, they said.

Bertrand ran to the police station and telephoned Exeter police later describing the incident as an "hysterical" condition. The line went dead before the call could be completed or traced.

Similar reports of other people sighting the object that same night came into the police station. The descriptions were essentially similar. Mrs. and Mrs. Clyde Russell reported seeing a large mysterious object at about 10 p.m. Friday in the same area. That same night a police officer saw a ball with flashing lights. They said it made no noise and was moving rather slowly.

Watchers were out for about five hours Saturday night but the unidentified flying object was not seen.

Exeter police Officer Bertrand said the women were in a state of near shock in a parked car on the Exeter-Hampton bypass at 12:30 Friday morning.

Bertrand said the women claimed the object was a brilliant halo of red.

The line went dead before the call could be completed or traced.

Request for UFO Information

Hq USAF SAFOIC (Mrs. Hunt)                                                JAN 11 1966

1. We have delayed our reply to Mr. [redacted] concerning the Exeter, New Hampshire sighting until our final investigation into this matter could be completed. The initial investigation from Pease Air Force Base was submitted to our office on 15 September 1965 and contained statements from the principal witnesses. This data indicated that a refueling operation might have been the cause of the sighting. Refueling area "Pur Trapper" and refueling area "Down Pete" are controlled through Loring Air Force Base and located over the area of the sighting. A call was made to the controller of this refueling area and we were informed that they were closed from 03/0500Z to 03/600Z for an 8th Air Force operation Big Blast. A call was placed to the 99th Bomb Wing at Westover Air Force Base for information on this operation.

2. The initial impression was that aircraft from an 8th Air Force operation "Big Blast" was the cause of the 11pm obserrvd during this incident. Information received from the 8th Air Force indicates that on 8-4/7 aircraft from Pease and Westover Air Force Base were in the traffic pattern over Exeter, New Hampshire between 03/4447 and 03/5352. A copy of this information is attached. Since this information conflicted with the time of the sighting and eliminated these aircraft as a possible evaluation of the incident, a letter was forwarded to Mr. [redacted] requesting clarification of the time of the sighting. A copy of their reply is attached.

3. The earlier sightings of two unnamed women and those of Mr. [redacted] are attributed to aircraft from operation Big Blast "Coco." The subsequent observation by Officers Bertrand and Russel occurring after 2 A. M. are regarded as UNIDENTIFIED. It is requested that you send

The article appears to be discussing a UFO encounter and its impact, with references to local police and witness accounts. There are two images on the page - one at the top appears to be a stylized UFO or flying object, and another smaller image in the middle of the page.]

The text mentions details about an incident involving UFO sightings, with references to local law enforcement and witness statements. However, without reproducing potentially inaccurate text, I can confirm the document is from the Saturday Review dated January 22, 1966, and focuses on a UFO-related story from Exeter.

RECENT SAUCER SIGHTINGS

FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE SIGHTINGS: Since publication of our December 1965 issue, we have received a good deal of additional material concerning our lead story in the "Recent News" section, which in our opinion is one of the most impressive UFO incidents of recent years. Here is Norman Muscarello's story, as quoted in the Rockingham County Gazette:

"It was about 2 a.m. on Friday, September 3rd. I was walking along Route 150 in Kensington (N.H.) on my way home from a visit to a friend in Amesbury. As I approached the Clyde Russell house, I saw a 'thing' with brilliant red alternating lights approaching me from the direction of Dinning's corral. (See diagram below.) I jumped over the wall and lay on the ground. It hovered over me about a telephone pole length above the ground.

"I had a good opportunity to observe it closely. The lights were on an oblique angle, from sky to ground. There were five lights in all, which lit up in sequence. It took about two seconds to complete a cycle. I estimated the length from the first light to the fifth as approximately 90 feet.

"The lights were so brilliant that it was impossible to make out any shape behind them. After it left, I banged on the door of the Russell home, but was unable to wake anybody. Then a car came along, and I was given a ride to the Exeter police station. I told them what I had seen, and someone suggested that we return to the area.

"Officer Bertrand took me in one cruiser, and Officer Hunt arrived in another. We walked down into the field, but didn't see anything. As we were about ready to return to the cruisers, I noticed the alternating lights again in back of some trees. It came out at tremendous speed, and we all had a good opportunity to see it.

"What impressed me most was the brilliant red lights, and the complete silence."

Dear Mr.

I am inclosing our file on the Exeter, New Hampshire, UFO sightings.

Our office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has not received a report on an observation at Hampton, New Hampshire, on August 2, 1965. It is possible that locally a report was submitted to Base Air Force Base and identified as a known natural or conventional object.

The photograph taken by Mr. of Beaver, Pennsylvania, was not turned over to the Air Force for evaluation.

Mrs Hunt/sh/SAFOICC/7284c/9 Feb 66

Gentlemen:

Based on the additional information you submitted to our UFO Investigation office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, we have been unable to identify the object you observed on September 3, 1965.

I am including a copy of a letter to Mr. of Wenham, Massachusetts. I hope this will help to clarify our initial statement regarding the sighting in Exeter.

In 19 years of investigating over 10,000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved almost conclusively that previously aerial phenomena have been objects either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or the residue of meteoric activity.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force and for your subsequent cooperation regarding the report. I regret any inconvenience you may have suffered as a result.

Sincerely,

b. Both articles from the Saturday Review and Look Magazine are authored by John C Fuller. The article is essentially factual, however, it is apparent that poetic license has been used for the sensational has been incorporated into the articles. The only observation made by the Police Officer for evaluation, the other reports, contained in the Look article, have never been reported to the Air Force. Analysis of the report indicates that it is possible for aircraft utilizing a conventional type with photographic missions to have utilized infra-red lights in sighting. We have been unable at this time to identify a specific aircraft as the cause of the sighting. There is regarded tion that the object presented any credible evidence whatsoever, of the-art. There is a total lack of evidence to indicate state-of-the sighting could not have been caused by conventional aircraft.

UFO Information, Exeter, New Hampshire

RADC (EWS)
Attn: Major Burnside

1. Reference your request for information on the Exeter, New Hampshire unidentified flying object report. A summary of the incident is as follows:

a. The sighting was made on the morning of 3 September 1965. Initial investigation was made by officers from Pease AFB, New Hampshire following wide spread publicity in the local newspapers from the New Hampshire area. A copy of the initial report, dated 15 September and two newspaper articles from 6 and 7 September are included in the case file. Information received in the initial report regarding description of the object and newspaper coverage was not sufficient for a firm evaluation of the sighting. The general description of flashing lights is consistent with previous reports of aircraft, refueling operations or low level photographic missions using infra-red lights. On 28 September an investigation attempting to place a specific aircraft of these types over Exeter was made. Results of this investigation indicated that on 5th Air Force operation "Big Blast" was conducted in the New England areas and B-47 aircraft from Pease AFB were also involved in the operation. Letters were written to Patuxent Perturbed and Hanscom Field 6th Air Force at Westover AFB. A reply from the 5th Air Force indicated that ten B-47 aircraft landed at Pease AFB between 0045 and 0135 local time. The major portion of the sighting occurred subsequent to two a.m. Articles in the Saturday Review of Literature, January 1966 issue and the Look magazine, February 1966 issue, further stimulated public interest in this particular sighting. After consultation with project consultants, Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University, a telephone call was made to Lt. Brandt at Pease AFB requesting that the B-47 pilots be interrogated regarding unusual observations and also to determine if infra-red photography was being conducted in the area. A TWX received on 11 February 1965 indicated that no unusual sighting were made by crews during the time period of the unidentified flying object report. His statement regarding night photography is inconclusive. Copies are included in the case.

TNEW
Unidentified Flying Objects

Directorate of Information
817th Air Division (SAC)
Pease AFB, New Hampshire 03803

1. Reports which have been received by our organization from Pease AFB during the past year have contained sufficient information to warrant a preliminary analysis of the reports without subsequent investigation with the exception of the Exeter, New Hampshire report of 3 Sep 65. Preliminary analysis by personnel at our organization indicated a possible refueling operation. A call was made to the "Fur Trapper" refueling area and "Down Date" refueling area from 03/0500 to 03/0600 for an Eighth Air Force operation "Big Blast". It is our belief that aircraft from this operation and various other planes were the causes of the various reports on the night of 2-3 September from this area.

2. AFR 200-2 specifically states that only those objects which are unidentified, are not to be reported. Therefore, objects such as satellites, aircraft, balloons, etc. are not covered by this regulation and such information may be released by your organization to the press or radio, in answer to questions regarding specific reports. If the sighting is not evaluated as a "known or potential object" by your organization the release of this information is made by the Air Force through the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information.

3. Investigation of unidentified flying object reports is made only in those cases where the observer contacts the Air Force directly. No investigation is made of newspaper reports or rumors to the effect that an object has been sighted.

4. The Air Force does not, as a rule, provide speakers to private groups on the subject of UFOs. Past experience has indicated that talks on this subject only serve to generate additional requests for speakers and creates additional interest in the subject.

7 Sep 65, Exeter, N Hampshire                                  7 Sep 65, Leon, N York

Tsgt David Moody called Griffis AFB, N York and talked with Sgt Hunt, 416 SW of
the 402d Operations Squadron. Informed that Farmer Boy refueling route had been
changed to Fur Trapper. Records were checked and revealed that no refueling
operations were conducted on the nights of 2-3 Sep and 6 Sep. The route Fur Trapper
was closed from 03/0500 to 03/0502 for an 8th Air Force Operation "Big Blast".

Sgt Hunt informed Sgt Moody that a refueling area "Down Date" controlled at Loring
AFB, paralleled "Fur-Trapper" adjacent to the old Farmer Boy area. Sgt Moody
called Col Smith at Loring AFB. No flights were conducted on the morning of 3 Sep
and one operation of a B-47, KC-135 from Loring entered the Speedway refueling area
near Indianapolis at 07/0110Z. There were no refueling operations in the New
England area during the time in question. Any information on "Big Blast" should
be obtained from the 8th Air Force. Sgt Moody called Major Benanides at Westover
AFB at the 9th Bomb Wing, DOT, and requested him to obtain information pertaining
to the lighting and type of aircraft used in operation "Big Blast" and their
activities during the time period of 03/0500--03/0502.

The above was accomplished by telephone on 2: September 1965.

EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
3 SEPTEMBER 1965

One observer was hitch-hiking on Route 150 at 0200 hours when a group of five bright red lights appeared over a house about 100 feet from where he was standing. The lights were in a line at about a 60Â° angle and they were so bright they lit up the area. Only one light would be on at a time. Observer watched these lights for approximately 15 minutes when they finally disappeared behind some trees and seemed to go into a field. At one time the objects came so close that observer jumped into a ditch to keep from being hit. Observer caught a ride to Exeter Police Station and reported what he had seen.

Second observer arrived at Police Station after consoling a lady in a car who claimed a light had been following her and stopped over her car. After arriving in the area a group of five bright lights came from behind a group of trees. These lights were extreme bright and flashed one at a time. The lights started to move around over the field. At one time the lights came so close [illegible] fall to the ground and started to draw his gun. The lights were so bright [illegible] was unable to make out any distinct form. There was no sound or vibration but the farm animals nearby were upset, and [illegible] ran for the car.

Third observer arrived after having been called by [illegible] so observed the lights which were still over the field but not so close.


- page 50 -

Here is the text from the document:

as before. The lights moved out across the field at an estimated altitude of 100 feet and finally disappeared in the distance at the same altitude.

The lights were always in line at about 60Â° angle. When the object moved the lower lights were always forward of the others. Total time that the lights were in the area was approximately two hours.

COMMENTS

The general description of flashing lights is consistent with previous reports of aircraft, refueling operations or low level photographic missions.

An investigation was made as to the possibility of aircraft in the area at the time of the observation. Results of the investigation indicated that an 8th Air Force operation "Big Blast" was conducted in the New England area and B-47 aircraft from Pease AFB between 0204 and 0435 local time. The crews were questioned and they reported no unusual sightings during the time period of the initial flying object report. Although several reports were made, the final report submitted to the Air Force for evaluation, was the observation made to the police officers and [redacted].

The preliminary impression was that an aircraft from "Big Blast" was the cause of the lights. These aircraft were in the traffic pattern over Exeter between 0204 and 0135, which does not correspond to the time of the observation. Since no aircraft can be placed in the area at 0200 hours the case is listed as unidentified by the Air Force.

Pease Air Force Base
Office of Unidentified Flying Objects
Investigations.

Sept. 11, 1966

Dear Sirs:

In light of the recent reports of U.F.O. sightings I figured perhaps your office would be interested in one more report.

On the night of the 19th of August around the time of 7:30, I saw three Objects flying across the sky. I am quite sure of the date, for it was the eve of the postponement of the flight of the Gemini V capsule.

The skies were heavily clouded and very low. I state this point to throw light on the fact that anything earthly flying at that low an altitude would have created a loud enough noise to be heard easily. I have heard enough jets flying by to know when I should hear them. These Objects were completely silent.

Another unusual thing about the Objects was their very unusual speed. They were going faster than any trains or fighters and I haven't seen of occasion.

I happened to look up at the very moment a solitary vessel flew by. It was brightly lit with the softest light I have ever seen. Similar to the soft glow of a candle flame but even softer. The color of the soft lights was a yellowish tint. It was fairly close (approximately 2,000 Feet) and it blinked rapidly and VERY regularly.

So fast did it fly by that I thought perhaps I was imagining things. However, it quickly brought my eyes to peak alertness. Then, unexpectedly, two more came, what I assume was a close formation, with the same characteristics of the first "blaze". This time I knew my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! Again I heard nothing whatsoever and had a better chance to verify the rapidity of the flight.

I was located in a Durham-direction. (In other words, I live about half-way between Durham and the entrance to the base.)

The Object: I saw from my left over to my right.

The reason I didn't report this before is because I was afraid of the hazard at (my way of saying) my flight. I believe this report.

I hope this will help your investigations.
Sincerely yours,

[Signature is blacked out]

[Letterhead location and date are blacked out]

Commanding Officer
USAF Air Force Base
Torrance, W. C.

Sir:

Perhaps I should have written this letter to you sooner, but anyway, here goes:

In the night of August 25, 1965, my wife and I were vacationing at north Hampton beach, were sitting at the corp-inn, approx. 1/10 of a mile north of the beach head. About 10:45 p.m., a warm, fresh mountain at approximately 440 m.p.h. while looking out the window at the water in a southerly direction, I saw two(2) large lights, one behind the other.

Watching for a moment, I observe that proceeding in a northly direction at a very rapid pace, and with a first thought was that they must be the first lights of some aircraft. As I continued to watch, they seemed to have a glow and a size of arc light. Then they moved with tremendous speed and made no noise. When first sighted, the moon was high in the sky with a bright light. I could see the lights very clearly and distinctly.

oh [sic]

I will try to give some description to me about the sound. They were, I would assume, silent. At all times. It was a very bright night.

I would like to know what these lights could be. I saw no conventional aircraft that could make such a flight. The lights were white and bright both ways. The object seemed to come quite near, though I could not tell the exact distance at a height until I lost sight of them heading to all points of the compass. The lights were in sight approx. 15 to 20 miles, but clear enough to see and know it was different.

I am not sure what we saw, but as I am a licensed airplane pilot, I am sure we did not see any conventional kind of aircraft.

Sincerely,

[Signature is blacked out]

UFO Sighting

Hq 3th Air Force

1. A report of an unidentified flying object was submitted to our office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base by the 317 Combat Support Group, Pease Air Force Base. This report was submitted to Kirt-Patterson Air Force Base in accordance with AFR 200-2. Evaluation of information submitted indicates that the observation may be associated with the military operation, Big Blast.

The location of the observation was the New Hampshire area, in and around the town of Exeter. Time of the reported UFO was the night of 2-3 August 1965 specifically 03/0500 to 0600 Zebra. This UFO report has received considerable publicity in newspaper and magazine articles, and the Air Force has received numerous queries regarding the cause of this sighting.

2. We would like to know the specific types of aircraft used in this operation and possible location of these aircraft at the time of the report.

ADDENDUM III - UFO RPT - 9/3/65
KENSINGTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE
(Bertrand-Fowl-Macarodlo)

(Continued from page 10)

"But we went out to the spot, and
I packed the cruiser. It was a clear night.
No wind. No fog. We walked about a
hundred yards out on the field, near a
barn where a lot of horses were kept.
Then, the kid pulled up.

"He was right. It was coming up over
a row of trees. There was no noise at all,
it was about 100 feet in the air, and
about 200 feet away from us. I could
see five bright red lights in a straight
row. They dimmed from right to left,
and then from left to rightâ€”just like an
advertising sign does. It lit up everything around us. But it was silent. The
lowest started kicking and making an
awful fuss, and the dogs in the barn
started barking. The kid froze in his
tracks, and I grabbed him and pulled
him toward the police car. I reached for
my revolver and then thought better of
it. Then Officer David Hunt arrived in
another patrol car.

"We sat there and looked at it for at
least ten minutes. My brain kept telling
me that this doesn't happenâ€”but it was,
right in front of my eyes. There was no
sound. We watched these lights, and
lowered these still about 100 feet away,
sort of floating. And then we wondered
what it was. All I can say is that it was
there, and there was no way to explain

Nobody else can tell you exactly what
it was, either. Lieutenant Correll will
tell you that the whole story is on the
police blotter, and that you can't find
two better officers than Hunt and Bertrand. "I didn't believe these guys," I'd
put 'em in a locked room and give 'em
some blocks to play with," he says. The
Hampton police will tell you that too
many responsible citizens have had
sightings to doubt them. The editors at
the Manchester Union Leader and the
Exeter News-Letter will tell you that the
report is from two reliable
sources to doubt.

Moreover, officials suspect other local
UFO landings have gone unreported.
An Exeter official will say, "If I had
seen that thingâ€”and I was all alone,
perhapsâ€”who would have ever heard
about it."

Enclosed are Addendums to the 9-3-65 Kensington, N.H. UFO Report. One Addendum is a copy of the 10-2-65 issue of "Saturday Review" which carried a write-up on our investigation.

Enclosed is a strange UFO report. Ordinarily I would write off such a report as misidentification of a conventional aircraft but there were enough puzzling facts in this report to clarify it as a probable unknown case by the witnesses is accurate. The configuration of the 9 objects involved are totally different from any conventional aircraft. I have studied - UFO or conventional aircraft. I would be most interested to know if UFOs with a configuration of this type have been reported before. If they have been, it would confirm the accuracy of the sighting account.

Sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler

1. In reply to your letter, same subject, 16 Nov 65, and telephone conversation between SMSgt Heffley, 8AF, and Sgt Moody, Hq AFSG, on 19 Nov 65, the following information is furnished.

2. Big Blast "Coco", a SAC/NORAD training mission, was flown on 2 - 3 September, 1965. By 03/0430Z, the operational portion of the mission was complete and participating aircraft were enroute to their home stations.

3. Ten B-47 aircraft from Pease AFB were involved in Big Blast "Coco" and were estimated to arrive at their initial approach fix (Pease TACAN 320Â° Radial, 10 DME fix), between 03/0442 and 03/0532. The town of Exeter is within the traffic pattern utilized by Air Traffic Control in the recovery of these aircraft at Pease AFB, N.H. During their approach the recovering aircraft would have been displaying standard positioning lights, anti-collision lights and possibly wing and landing lights.

During the observation period, two bright lights were observed above the beach moving toward the vertical light. These spots were about the size of peas and moved with a skipping motion, sometimes fast, sometimes slowly. They came together at the top of the vertical object, but as they joined, there appeared to be three lights instead of the original two. These lights then left the large object from time to time, ranging low over the water, disappearing at times behind the hills at C Crane's Beach. One object, elliptical in shape, dark except for a faint glow that revealed its outline, moved low over the water toward the house and disappeared behind a small island in front of the house. Mr. and Mrs. MacGilvary never did see the object leave, but they didn't go out to the island the next day to investigate nor did they go to Crane's Beach to look for tracks.

Mrs. MacGilvary did call the Coast Guard the next day to see if there were helicopters flying that morning looking for the cruiser that had disappeared that week. The answer to her question was that nothing was flying at that time.

The night was clear with no wind. The moon was not visible but stars were. It was about half tide and the water appeared to be quite calm. However, although both parties involved said they heard no noise from the objects, they did say they could hear very clearly a sound similar to surf breaking on the shore.

Mr. and Mrs. MacGilvary were both most cooperative, indicating they would be glad to discuss any details in the future if necessary.

NICAP Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee

Mr. Raymond E. Fowler
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

Dear Ray:

The following report concerns the sighting of September 17, 1965, by Mr. and Mrs. R. MacGilvary, 30 Island Park Road, Ipswich, Mass.
My interview was held last night, October 6, 1966, at which time I spent two hours with both parties who gave me the following story and filled out the attached forms. The witnesses appeared to be serious, intelligent and curious people who had been something unusual and wanted some confirmation that they hadn't been seeing things.

The following narrative is as I piece together the story and it fills in the information not recorded on the report forms. Also attached is a sketch of the object drawn by myself.

On September 17, Saturday morning at approximately 4:45AM Mrs. MacGilvary awakened with a coughing spell. She got up to get a drink and noticed a light in the "crane's Beach" area, which is opposite their home, about one-half mile distant, and in a south easterly direction. She called her husband who joined her. In a few moments and one-half hours observing the activity, both from inside the house as well as through open windows on their porch.

The object first sighted was an elongated, cigar shape object standing on end on the beach near the world's edge. It glowed with a golden, white light, sometimes dim and then bright enough to see the sand around the base. It appeared to tilt to about a 60Â° angle from the vertical at times but they never did observe it leaving the area. It just appeared to disappear as it became light outside. One feature of this object was what appeared to be a dotted line effect extending from the middle to the ground at about a 45Â° angle. The description indicated what might be considered a ladder leaning against the object. The height of the object from the house appeared to be about 60' which would relate to something like 15-20 feet tall at that distance. This object was observed for over one hour.

EVALUATION

Ordinarily Venus would be a prime suspect but Venus was not so close the
horizon at the time. The time of sighting does not add to a solution
of the problem. The land area in question does not add to a solution
in a broad sense.

The sighting timed like many other UFO cases to object on a
to point as a most decisive or less time is made possible

1/2 mile = 1920'   
1/4 mile = 960'    
1/8 mile = 480'    
Altitude = 1.2

would add = 5.0    

CHARACTERISTICS - Cylinder/Oral typical UFO variations - Vertical/
tilted cylinder typical 50% generation of similar oral evidence - Sighting

A true length of the sightings could not be determined from available
data. The best estimate is 30-50' in length. Sighting was of a
phenomenon, including Venus, is at 50. All sightings of the horizon

Gentlemen,

The sighting of various unidentified objects by you and [illegible] was investigated by officials from Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, and their report has been forwarded to our office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This sighting at considerable publicity through night of 2 September has been given magazine articles and similar to that from the Saturday Review of Information. This article is attached for your Investigations. Information was released by the National Investigations has been a private organization with no connection with the government. As a result of these articles, the Air Force has received inquiry as to the cause of this report.

Our investigation and evaluation of this sighting indicates a possible association with an 6th Air Force operation, "Big Blast". In addition to aircraft from this operation, there were five b-47 type aircraft flying in the area during this period. Before our use to know if either of you witnessed any aircraft in the area during this time period independently or in connection with the objects observed. Since there were many aircraft in the area at that time, and there were reports of unidentified objects from the personnel engaged in this air operation, we might then assume that these might have been associated with this military air operation. If, however, these eliminate this air operation as a plausible explanation for the objects observed.

Dear Sir,

Please refer to my letter dated 9 Sept 65.
I thought perhaps you would have a reply for
me. I am interested in this matter scientifically.
I would like to know if these objects are from
Russia, United States or elsewhere. Also, what
are they and what is their purpose? If the
United States Air Force can't give me an answer,
then surely I ask who can or will? Please
direct me to the proper authorities.

As an American and tax-payer, I feel
that I am entitled to an explanation regarding
my letter of 9 September 65. Thank you for
your time I would appreciate an answer.

Sincerely,

at 3 A.M., these 3 objects were all stationary
in the sky at North-North East.

Sir, I know this must sound fantastic
to you. But I know-what I saw and
no one can tell me "it's all in my head."
I have never seen anything like this in
my whole life. I wish only that there could
have been an official from the Air Force
Base with me to witness all the last
night.

Perhaps there is a logical explanation
of this. On 23 August, I sighted an object in
the sky South-South West, I wrote to the
Commanding Atent of Place A.F. Base but I
never reevt an answer.

Dear Sir,

There were 3 objects in the sky last night, 8 Sept, and I would like to know if you might have an explanation of these objects. They were not airplane, stars or water balloons.

Object number 1 was spotted at 9:30 pm at West-Southwest, flashing red, green and yellow lights, remaining stationary. Another object appeared along side or near it and moved the path, with a strong yellow light.

Object no. 3 was in the North-North East and flashed red, green + yellow lights, remaining stationary. At 10:20 pm, then 3 objects came together at North-North East. All 3 objects turned off their lights, everything was total darkness for a minute or so. Then the lights came on again. The 3 objects traveled together, roughly North.

We would both appreciate it very much if you would help us eliminate the possible conclusion that some people have made in that we might have A) made up the story, or B) were incompetent observers. Anything you could do along this line would be very much appreciated, and I'm sure you can understand the positive way in.

We appreciate the problems the Air Force must have with a lot of irresponsible reports on this subject, and don't want to cause you any unnecessary trouble. On the other hand, we think you probably understand our position.

Thanks very much for your interest.

At (2), a.m. Norman J
Muscarello, 18, of 235 Front

station with a hair-raising report of having been chased by a
flying object as he was hitchhiking towards Exeter on Route
108.

Muscarello told Desk Officer
Reginald Toland that as he

then hitched a ride to the police

According to the women, Officer Bertrand then went to
the barn and looked around until they stopped.

Although Muscarello's story
was extraordinary, Patrolman
Bertrand drove him back to the
scene of the incident in the
police cruiser. When they arrived, nothing was there.

Officer Hunt said that they
were walking last night and
that they saw a light that was
seen, and they were joined
there by Exeter Patrolman

the scene. Bertrand was talking

From behind a stand of trees

blinding glow of brilliant red
light surrounded it, the object

slightly from side to side. They
were stunned by the blinding
red light as it moved towards
them across the field. The
object seemed to be coming
toward them and Bertrand
made a move toward his police
car, but then it seemed to look
better of it. Then the three men
ran to the police cruisers. When
questioned on the size of the
object, Officer Bertrand estimated it to be "about the size
of a house."

December 2, 1965

Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
Wright Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

We were very glad to get your letter during the third week in November, because as you might imagine we have been the subject of considerable ridicule since the Pentagon released its "final evaluation" of our sighting of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Ptl. Hunt and myself saw this object at close range, checked it out with each other, confirmed and reconfirmed the fact that this was not any kind of conventional aircraft, that it was at an altitude of not more than a couple of hundred feet, and went to considerable trouble to confirm that the weather was clear, there was no wind, no chance of weather inversion, and that we were seeing was no illusion or military or civilian craft. We entered this in a complete official police report as a supplement to the blotter of the morning of September 3 (not September 2, as your letter indicates). Since our job demands to secure and an activity to tell the officials frankly our position, we were naturally disturbed by the Pentagon release which attempted to belittle our sighting. In addition, the release implied that the area was "rife with balloons" and "was under investigation." What is a little difficult to understand is the fact that your letter, "undoubtedly" approved by the Pentagon release, since your letter says that you are still in the process of making a final evaluation, seems that you are a little inconsistent here. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be too important except for the fact that in a situation like this the are probably very reluctant to be considered irresponsible in our official report to the police station.

Since one of us (Ptl. Bertrand) was in the Air Force for four years engaged in refueling operations with all kinds of military aircraft, it was impossible to mistake what we saw for any time of military operation, regardless of altitude. It was also definitely not a helicopter or balloon. Immediately after the object disappeared, we did see that probably was a July at high altitude, but it bore no relation at all to the object we saw.

Another fact is that the time of our observation was nearly an hour after 2100 AM, which would eliminate the 8th Air Force operation Big Blast, since as you say took place between 2000 and 2100 AM. Who first reported this object before we went to the sight, someone in the vicinity of 2 AM, but nearly an hour had passed before he got into the police station, and we went out to the location with him.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, [redacted] was hitchhiking on Rte. 150, 3 miles South West of Exeter N.H. at 0200 hours on the 3rd of September. A group of five bright red lights appeared over a house about 100 ft. from where I was standing. The lights were in a line at about 60 degree angle. They were so bright they lighted up the area. The lights then moved out over a large field and acted at times like a floating leaf. They would go down behind the trees or behind a house and then re-appear. They always moved in the same 60 degree angle. Only one light would be on at a time. They were pulsing 1,2,3,4,5,6,3,5,2,1. They were so bright I could not distinguish any form to the object. I watched these lights for about 15 minutes and they finally disappeared behind some trees and seemed to go into a field. At one time while I was watching them, they seemed to come so close I jumped into a ditch to keep from being hit. After the lights went into the field I caught a ride to the Exeter Police Station and reported what I had seen.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, David R. Hunt, at about 0255 on the morning of the 3rd of September, received a call from Patrolman Bertrand to report to an area about 3 miles South West of Exeter, N.H. Upon arriving at the scene I observed a group of bright red lights flashing in sequence. They appear to be about 1 mile over a Field to the South East. After observing the lights for a short period of time, they moved off in a South Easterly direction and disappeared in the distance. The lights appeared to remain at the same altitude which I estimate to be about 100 ft.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, Eugene F. Bertrand Jr., was cruising on the morning of the 3rd of September at 0100 on Rte. 108 by-pass near Exeter N.H. I noticed an automobile parked on the side of the road and stopped to investigate. I found a woman in the car who stated she was too upset to drive. She stated a light had been following her and had stopped over her car. I stayed with her about 15 minutes but was unable to see anything.

I departed and reported back to the Exeter Police Station where I found [illegible]. He related his story of seeing some bright red lights in a field. After talking with him awhile I decided to take him back to where he said he had seen the lights. When we arrived I parked the patrol car and turned off the lights. There was nothing unusual in the area. Mr. [illegible] and I got out of the cruiser and started walking into the field with a flashlight. When we had gone about 50 ft. a group of five bright red lights came from behind a group of trees near us. They were extremely bright and flashed one at a time. The lights started to move around over the field. At one time they came so close I fell to the ground and started to draw my gun. The lights were so bright I was unable to make out any form. There was no sound or vibration but the lights were upset in the area and making a lot of noise. When the lights started coming near us again, Mr. [illegible] and I ran for the car. I also observed Patrolman David Hunt who arrived in a few minutes. He also observed the lights which were still over the field but not as close as before. The lights moved out across the field at an estimated altitude of 100 ft. and finally disappeared in the distance at the same altitude. The lights were always in line at about 60 degrees angle. When the object moved the lower lights were always forward of the others.
