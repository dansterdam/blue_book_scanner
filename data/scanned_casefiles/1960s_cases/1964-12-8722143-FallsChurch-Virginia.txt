1. The observation reported by Mrs. Falls Church, Virginia, on the morning of 14 December 1964 has all the characteristics of an observation of the moon due to refraction. Since the moon was out-performed above the horizon by the reported object, it is considered consistent with an observation of the moon, her sighting is regarded as an astronomical body.

2. Reported position of the object was just above the trees to the southeast. The object was stationary. In this approximation quarter on 12 December reaching a full stage on the 19th. Mrs. for the attraction of FTD from 1641, therefore, the position as reported by the observer indicates that it was hazy and the stated that no sharp were visible. The sequence of changes in the appearance of the object during the observation period is consistent with the position of the setting moon due to an inversion.
