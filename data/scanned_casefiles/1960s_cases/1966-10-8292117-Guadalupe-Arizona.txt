REPORTING OFFICER: A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WITH MISS [REDACTED] AT THE
POINT SHE OBSERVED THE OBJECT LED TO A LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR HER.
SIGNAL 36, SKY HARBOR MUNICIPAL IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR (4)
MILES NORTHWEST OF GUADALUPE. AN AIRPLANE FLYING AN EXTENDED
LANDING PATTERN WOULD PRESENT THE SAME PATH WHICH SHE DESCRIBED. IT
IS LIKELY THAT SHE SAW SUCH AN AIRPLANE IN ITS APPROACH TO SKY HARBOR.
SHE DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND IN THIS TYPE OF
OBSERVATION AND SEEMED TO BE A RELATIVELY UNRELIABLE WITNESS. HER
17 YEAR-OLD BROTHER WAS ALSO INTERVIEWED, AS A WITNESS. HE
APPEARED PARTICULARLY UNRELIABLE.
