Dear Sirs:

I have heard that you have stopped investigating unidentified flying objects. 

Since you are not investigating them could you please send me a copy of the questions-hair's that you send to people?

Do you still get reports from cranpots about sacting "flying saucers"?

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,

Dear Sir

I am mailing this report as a follow-up on the object sighted on the evening of July 8, 1964 in the Cleveland, Ohio area. As stated in my initial report, I was driving home from work when I observed an unusual object in the sky. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a bright, pulsating light. It was hovering in the sky and then suddenly accelerated and moved out of sight rapidly. 

I am unable to provide any additional details about the size, altitude, or speed of the object as I was rather shaken by the experience and did not have the opportunity to closely observe it. However, I can confirm that what I witnessed was unlike any conventional aircraft I have seen before. I hope this additional information is helpful for your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further details from me.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Transcription of the text:

The observer states that the object was cigar shaped, approximately 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and appeared to be metallic in color. It was observed moving in a straight line at a high rate of speed and then suddenly made a right angle turn and accelerated out of sight. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute. There was no sound associated with the object. The observer states that he watched the object through 7x50 binoculars.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDBCR   

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI (Mr. Galaser)

On 13 July 1964, MCCLURE, OHIO, reported a sighting of an aircraft that he considers to be a possible UFO. The sighting occurred at approximately 2210 hours (10:10 PM) EST on 13 July 1964. The object was described as a bright, white light that appeared somewhat larger than a star. It was observed in the southeast sky, maintaining a stationary position for about 15 minutes, after which it moved off to the east at a high rate of speed and disappeared. The object exhibited no visible means of propulsion. The observer states that the object was observed by several other persons in the area, but I have no additional information on the number of observers or their description of the object.

This sighting is of interest in that it was made by a mature and reliable observer who is associated with a known military activity. It is likely that Mr. MCCLURE has had some experience in observing aircraft. The area is sparsely populated and it is considered a possible aircraft observation site. This office would appreciate any additional information your office can provide on this sighting.
