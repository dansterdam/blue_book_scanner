At 2215, 12 Oct 65, I received a call from a Mr. [redacted], Montgomery, NY, (phone [redacted]) who stated that he saw an unidentified flying object at approximately 1915 to 2000 hours local time. He was at his home at the time, located 1 mile east of Montgomery NY. In his words he stated: "that he saw a flashing red light going up and down quickly, faster than an airplane, and made a funny noise when up close but no noise when further away. He said it was about 5000 to 6000 feet high at the closest. And that it moved from east to west, then to the north east."

Mr. [redacted] indicated that he was a member of the CAP, and had reported the above information to his CAP Leader, who advised him to make a report to Stewart AFB.

I immediately made an informal investigation with Base Weather Station, Stewart Tower, and RAPCON Control. Tower advised that a helicopter was working with RAPCON at the reported time, and that the helicopter was using an altitude of 1925L to 2051L, covering the time that the alleged UFO appeared. On the helicopter's first low approach he proceeded to the outer marker, flew out 12 to 13 miles west of the Base, made a procedure turn, missed the outer marker and went back out to re-intercept. After computing its approach, the helicopter proceeded to make several other low approaches on runway 09. These maneuvers would place the helicopter in the immediate vicinity of Montgomery, and at published FLG altitude of 2300 feet. Weather reported in the vicinity was 25,000 feet scattered, 20 miles visibility. No other UFO sightings were made to this office.

It is my opinion that the object sighted by [redacted] was in fact helicopter CH30.
