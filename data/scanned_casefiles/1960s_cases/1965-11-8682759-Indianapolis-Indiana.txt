Commander,
Bunker Hill Air Force Base
Bunker Hill, Indiana

Dear Sir:

As advised by the Indiana State Police Department we have taken the liberty of forwarding on pertinent information in regards foreign objects in the sky.

On the evening of November 19, 1965 at approximately 8:00 P.M. we were driving north on Madison Avenue when we sighted an object hovering in the sky, the approximate location of 2700 on Madison. We were at Hanna and Madison almost four blocks away and it looked to be 250 to 300 ft. high in the sky. We first thought it to be a plane preparing to land at the airport on westward, but in appearance to glow from white to yellow then to red darting at tremendous speed head almost northwest. This lasted almost five minutes.

We were of the opinion in the past, sighting of such objects were optical illusions or works of the imagination, but after this experience there is no doubt in our minds.

[Redacted] is a teacher at Woodview Junior High School and previous to his present position was responsible for setting up the advanced science program for Parr Junior High School in Indianapolis. In other words, we have been used to dealing in facts, not fantasies.

It is our hope the above information may be of some assistance.

Very truly yours,
