Radio Station WHO is both AM and FM commercial radio station operating on the following frequencies AM 990KC, FM 96.5 MC. WHO AM broadcasts are primarily designed to cater to teen-age listeners with commercial promotions of various types and the dialogue emphasizing UFO contests and increasing listener interest on this subject.

Mr. [redacted] uses a "stage name" of [redacted] while broadcasting as a "Disc-jockey." I noted one sponsor has a taped announcement concerning a contest to identify a "UFO" and receive a prize. When the disc-jockey announced the start of a network baseball game broadcast he stated "Well gang I'll return right after the ballgame with more of the same. In the meantime I'll be looking for UFO's."

CLIPPING FROM ORLANDO SENTINEL 10 MAY 1966

Everybody
But Police
Sees Lights

The little green men are
back at it again!
Hundreds of Orlandoans
reported to police and The
Sentinel Monday night that
were objects were hovering over the Central Florida
landscape.

THE ORANGE County
Sheriff's Department dispatched a car to Colonial
High School after callers
reported the object (or objects) in that area. The
deputies reported seeing
nothing unusual.

The Sentinel received in
excess of 40 calls. Reports
of sightings ranged from
the Pine Hills area to College Park and the east end
of the county.

Most observers agreed it
was green, red, pink, white
or some other color, that it
was round, square, oblong,
shapeless or crescent
shaped and that it zigged,
zagged, rocked back and
forth, rushed forward and
backed up or remained motionless while it was visible.

insufficient data for evaluation until forms are received.
