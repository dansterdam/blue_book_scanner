The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing the activities of a radio station WKIQ in relation to UFO-related programming and content.

Text transcription:

Radio Station WKIQ is both AM and FM commercial radio station operating on the following frequencies: AM 950 KC and FM 96.5 MC. WKIQ AM broadcasts various UFO related programs and commercial promotions of various types and the dialogue emphasizing UFO contests and increasing interest in this subject.

Mr. _____ uses a "stage name" of "___" while broadcasting as a announcer. This disc-jockey has a background in electronic engineering. When he announced the start of a network baseball game broadcast, he stated "Well, that's a lot more of the same . . . in the meantime . . ." indicating his disinterest in the game in lieu of discussing UFOs.

Everybody
But Police
Sees Lights

The blue green men are
back at it again.
Hundreds of Orlandoans
reported to police and the
sheriff's office that they
saw strange objects glowing over the Central Florida
landscape.

THE ORANGE COUNTY
Sheriff's Department dispatched a team to Colonial
High School after officers
reported the object (or objects) in this area. Witnesses
described the glowing, moving, unusual object.

The Sentinel received in
excess of 40 calls Reports
of sightings ranged from
lights seen in the Lee Park and the east end
of the county.

Most observers agreed it
was green, red, pink, white
or some other color, that it
was round, and that it moved
with great speed, changed
shape and that it zigged,
zagged, stopped, backed and
moved forward, up and
backed up or remained motionless while it was visible.
