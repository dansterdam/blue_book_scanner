10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: While tracking of unusual objects. objects were detected by ground radar and were confirmed by visual observation. Objects were reported to appear about the size of a man's fist held at arm's length and displayed rapid movement, more irregular than planets and displayed erratic maneuvers. However, it is impossible to determine the exact size, speed, or distance of the objects from the radar returns. Various sightings during this period were evident. After digressing with her following the reflection, the objects were visible with no reflection being evident. Witness was reporting the incident and other officers were nearby during the observation.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (X-##)

1. On 8 November 1960 the object was first sighted by the witness, a resident of Ft. Seneca, Ohio. The witness was a retired U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant on duty at the time of the incident.

2. In the referenced letter, the witness claims to have sighted an unusual object at approximately 10:30 P.M. on the night of 8 November 1960. The witness further states that the object remained visible for approximately an hour and ten minutes, and that he was able to observe it through 7x50 binoculars. The witness also reported that other individuals were present and also observed the object.

3. Telephone contact with the witness on 10 November 1960 did not add any significant information. The witness could not contribute anything specific, but appeared all indications as being truthful and cooperative. The witness did describe the motion and characteristics of the object as "brilliant and oscillating."

4. It is noted that the case that a sighting was made and the fact that the witness apparently exhibited characteristics of truthfulness. However, no positive identification of the object was made, nor could the witness contribute any reliable data or information that would enable a positive identification. The sighting, as reported, could not be positively identified or explained.

5. Telephone contact was made with the Erie County Sheriff's Department to establish a possible independent verification or corroborating evidence of the sighting, but during the time in question, no other sightings or reports were received from the local area.

6. It appears strange that the object was only person-reported and no other independent verification could be obtained from the area, if indeed, there were objects present as described.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

The object viewed by the witness was possibly a complete disk, about the size of a small plane, with brilliant white lights on the bottom, possibly of a pulsatile nature, and it appeared to be approximately five hundred feet above the ground and was traveling in a northerly direction at moderate speed. 

It has been impossible to obtain the weather data for the location and time of the sighting. The witness first observed the object at approximately 8:30 PM on 17 August 1960 and it was visible for approximately 2 minutes.  The witness could not obtain any photographs. Further consideration of this sighting is not considered necessary as the information received is not sufficient to warrant any additional action.

25 NOV 1959
SUBJJCT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting
1. On the evening of 28 October 1959 at approximately 7:30 PM, the witness reported observing an extremely bright source of light approximately 10 degrees above the horizon located North-Northeast of his position.
2. On the subsequent letters, the witness described the object as having a disc-like appearance, bright and glowing, and that the object was approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The witness also stated that the object appeared to have emanatifions from the top and bottom of the object and that the object appeared to rotate or oscillate as it was observed.
3. Telephone contact with witness on 30 November 1959 did not add any additional information to the original report. The witness could not furnish any additional details regarding the sighting and reiterated his previous statements.
4. The witness, who had been in the service, stated that he had observed a similar object approximately 2 years prior while in the service. The witness further stated he was in a vehicle at that time and was traveling when he observed the object for a brief period of time.
5. It appears the witness, a retired Air Force officer, reported the sighting to the local authorities in an effort to ascertain any additional information regarding the object observed. To this date, the witness has received no additional information from the authorities concerning the sighting.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

It is not possible to obtain the weather data for the date of this report as this was not requested in the initial report. However, the weather data obtained by the observer, as reported, indicates that the weather was clear at the time of observation. No further consideration of the weather data has been made. 
On view of the observer claim, it is possible to state tentatively that the observed object had the following characteristics: Bright light, round or oval in shape, hovered for about 15-20 minutes, and was first observed at an altitude estimated to be about 1000 feet and later at an estimated altitude of several hundred feet. The observer stated that he observed the object through binoculars and that it appeared to have a metallic surface which reflected the sunlight.
While these data are not conclusive, they suggest that the observed object does not correspond to any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable object. Therefore, the probable cause your object will be tentatively notified.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting, Ft. Seneca, Ohio

1. On 7 October 1960, at approximately 2030 hours, Mr. George C. Keiser, a resident of Ft. Seneca, Ohio, reported seeing an unidentified object in the sky over Ft. Seneca. Mr. Keiser stated that the object was first observed at an azimuth of approximately 270 degrees and an elevation of 15 to 20 degrees. The object was described as a bright, glowing ball of light which was stationary for about 10 to 15 seconds, then suddenly accelerated upward at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object was observed for a total of approximately 30 seconds.

2. According to Mr. Keiser, the object was observed through a window of his residence, and no sound was heard. The sky was described as clear with 7/8 cloud cover at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The wind velocity was estimated at 5 to 10 knots from the southwest.

3. Mr. Keiser was interviewed by the undersigned on 8 October 1960. He appeared to be a reliable and competent witness. The interview was conducted in the presence of Mrs. Keiser, who corroborated her husband's account of the observation.

4. This report is being submitted for your information.

1. At approximately 1000 hours on 22 September 1960, an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) was observed by two members of the 98th BOMARC Missile Squadron, United States Air Force, at the Fort Seneca, Ohio, BOMARC Missile Site.
2. The UFO was first sighted by Airmen First Class JOHN DOE and RICHARD ROE, who were on perimeter patrol duty at the time. They reported that the object was silver-colored, round or oval in shape, and appeared to be hovering approximately 600-800 feet above the ground and a mile to a mile and a half from their observation point. The object remained in sight for approximately five minutes and then disappeared from view in a rapid horizontal movement.
3. Airmen Doe and Roe immediately notified the Missile Site Commander, who in turn notified higher headquarters. An investigation was immediately initiated and additional information is being developed.
4. It is requested that this Headquarters be informed of any further developments in this case.

I could see it was headed in the direction I was traveling but it came right over me and made no sound whatsoever and was about 100 yds. Above the ground. It's shape was oval to round in nature and seemed to give off no light but had a definite outline. It made no sound and appeared to be under intelligent control as it changed course and speed several times and then disappeared straight up at a terrific rate of speed. No vapor trail or exhaust was visible. I would estimate it to be about 45-50 ft. in diameter.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

 and was observing the stars. About 10:15 PM, I observed a unusual light in the northwest sky. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but as I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in a very erratic and unusual manner, unlike any satellite I have ever seen. After watching it for several minutes, I decided to call my neighbor, [redacted], to come out and observe it with me. We both watched the object for approximately 15-20 minutes. It appeared to be a very bright light, much brighter than any of the stars, and it moved in a very zigzag pattern, changing directions abruptly. At times it appeared to hover motionless, then suddenly dart off in another direction. The light seemed to pulsate or flicker at times. We could not make out any definite shape or structure, just a bright, pulsating light. It finally disappeared from view to the northwest. We were both amazed at what we had seen and could not understand or explain the nature of the object. It did not seem to be an aircraft of any kind, nor did it resemble any known astronomical object. We discussed it for some time afterwards, but could arrive at no definite conclusion as to what it might have been. I have observed many different types of aircraft and astronomical phenomena, but have never seen anything like this before. It was a most unusual and puzzling experience.

Come here to see this from (unclear) observation. There was a bright light in the sky over my house around 9:30 p.m., Oct. 7, 1960. It seemed to be about 50-75 ft. above the top of a large oak tree. It hovered there motionless for about 3 minutes, then started moving slowly in a northwesterly direction, slanting slightly upward. After moving about 1/4 mile, it suddenly accelerated and shot off at an extremely high speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. 
There was no sound at any time, and it did not seem to be attached to anything. I have no idea what it was, but it was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or anything else I've ever seen before. 
Thinking back, I should have called the police or someone, but I was so excited and amazed at what I was seeing that I just stood there watching it until it was gone. I have never seen anything like this before, and hope I never do again.

OFFICIAL FILE COPY

1. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes, it was described as being elliptical in shape with a bright orange color. It appeared to be emitting a hazy glow and was seen hovering approximately 500-600 feet in the air.

2. The object moved slowly across the sky from south to north at an estimated speed of 30-35 mph. During this time it maintained a constant altitude and did not make any sudden or erratic maneuvers.

3. The object was observed concurrently by 10 witnesses, who stated that the object seemed to be under intelligent control and that it did not resemble any known aircraft. They also reported that the object appeared to change shape and size during the observation period.

4. The witnesses stated that the object remained visible for approximately 15-20 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view at a high rate of speed.

5. This sighting was made during clear, calm weather conditions with good visibility. There were no cloud cover or other atmospheric conditions that could have contributed to the appearance of the object.

6. All the witnesses were considered reliable and their testimony was consistent with one another. They all independently corroborated the details of the sighting.

At 8:00 p.m. on 6 October 1960, this observer (name deleted) received a telephone call from (name deleted) who resides at (address deleted), Fort Seneca, Ohio. (Name deleted) stated that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over his home at approximately 7:45 p.m. that same evening.

(Name deleted) stated that the object was circular in shape, appeared to be silver in color, and emitted a yellow-orange glow. He stated that the object was approximately 100 feet in diameter and that it hovered over his home for approximately 15 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. (Name deleted) further stated that the object made no sound and that he had been able to observe it clearly through his binoculars.

This observer immediately contacted the Ohio State Highway Patrol and requested that they investigate the sighting. The on-duty officer stated that he would look into the matter and contact this observer with any additional information.

The foregoing is a true and accurate account of the report received from (name deleted) on 6 October 1960 regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object over his home in Fort Seneca, Ohio."

3 was reported 1976 on the 8th by Mrs. Walter Blacker Jr. of 3325 Broad St., Ft. Seneca, Ohio. She reported that she and her husband saw an oval-shaped, bright orange object hovering over a wooded area across the road from their home. The object appeared to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter and was at an altitude of about 50 to 60 feet. It hovered silently for about 30 seconds and then shot straight up and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard. The object did not appear to have any appendages or projections. It was a clear night with good visibility. The reporting witness appears to be reliable. No physical evidence was obtained.

and curiouc.
This unusual type of  report is be  n presented  since it refers to certain data and phenomena which may be of interest and importance with relation to the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena.
The source of this information is considered reliable and accurate. The details given have been carefully checked and verified as far as possible.
On the afternoon of  4 September 1960, at approximately 4:15 pm, an employee of the Western Union Telegraph Co.  was making a routine check of the telegraph lines in the Seneca area, south of Tiffin, Ohio. He was driving along a rural road when he noticed  a strange aerial object in the sky about 1/2 mile to the east. The object was about 15-20 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and metallic in appearance. It was hovering over the top of a group of trees at an altitude of perhaps 200-300 feet.
The witness stopped his truck and watched the object for about 5 minutes. During this time it remained stationary, except for a slight swaying motion. It then accelerated rapidly and flew off to the northeast at a very high speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.
The witness stated that the object was completely silent and gave off no exhaust or vapor trail. He was quite impressed by the performance and appearance of the object, and reported the incident to his superiors at Western Union and to the local police authorities.

I am James Lutz of Ft. Seneca, Ohio and have been interested in the subject of flying saucers for some time. On the evening of October 8, 1960 at approximately 8:15 p.m. I observed an unusual object in the sky. The object was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length and appeared to be silver in color. It was moving in an erratic manner, darting back and forth and up and down. It made no sound that I could hear. I watched the object for about 2 or 3 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. I have no idea what this object was, but I am certain it was not an airplane, meteor, or any other known object. I have seen many things in the sky over the years, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I hope this report will be of some value in the continuing investigation of unidentified flying objects.

I called my wife to come and look and she also saw them. We watched for 10-15 minutes the craft just gliding through the air without any sound. Then they sort of swish off quickly and vanished. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen before. It was a real strange sight.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

6. At 1900 hours the witness reported the object to be moving in a SW direction and at an estimated speed of 120 m.p.h. As it was leaving the area, the object took on a red glow and seemed to disappear.

7. It was been impossible to obtain the negative from the witness as he did not take any pictures and the camera he had with him did not have film in it.

8. In the opinion of the witness, the object was approx 60 feet in dia and had a white light which appeared to be on the top of the object. During the observation the object appeared to be rotating and had a luminous color and glow about it.

9. AFOSR does not consider this case closed, and if necessary will submit a request for another AF investigator to reinterview the witness and conduct a more thorough investigation.
