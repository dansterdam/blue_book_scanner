Summary 5 rect

On February 24, 1964, from 5:16:30 pm to 5:19:30 (MA) I observed an unidentified flying object (a white, yellowish light) elliptical with a blinking, bright, white, steady light.

In the vicinity of Racine, WI (at 14 mi) I first sighted at quickly diminishing height, in the direction of settlement after light? This object drifted in a zigzag course, on very constant, but not straight path, from high, pure, plain, from plain, pure, plane, flash, light & didn't keep plane, plane, plane, plane, plane, plane,

northwest by course. All seemed to state that it
at approximately north. The width and the position north
approximately course off did this once, and say again
quite at internal at leg.

Since the distance to the object is unknown, its
size "latitude" might well be left.

I watched did not resolve any program aircraft and
before, it followed moving had one might, mostly on my
northwest ongoing proper yet.

It (the object itself) appeared to follow its course
at a perfectly uniform speed. At no time did the
object pulsate on the dot.

It also seemed solid. It could not have thought it
was polka orange lights on the bottom block out
portion of the object.

I saw it for about a total of 1 minute. I observed
it from about 5:16:30 PM CST to 5:17:30 CST
when I first saw it, it was about fifteen (15) degrees
east of North (as best as I can approximate) and between 5
to degrees above the horizon. It disappeared 45° west of
north over the horizon. It could be seen through the
thin haze. The object could be seen only through atmosphere or
clouds where one it would visit to the safe range.

My ability for the past ##### seen again since then
airplane as I can thoroughly formulate with most insight.

Dear Sirs:

I was made out a report on an unidentified flying object that I saw some time ago. In my hope that I have made a sufficient information and data on the UFO to give a better understanding of the sighting. I know it is almost beyond your view it can really be what it became of a few notes only because it was the most unusual and object I have ever seen.

Yours truly,

[Signature and other identifying details are blacked out]

Date: February 23, 1965

The rest of the text appears to be redacted or blacked out with black lines covering the "Name" and "Signature" fields.

Here is the text from the document:

1) When did you see the object?
    31    Feb    1964

2) Time of Day
    5 and 16 minutes P.M.

3) Time Zone    Central Standard

4) When were you when you saw the object?
    I just saw the object through the north upstairs window of our house, watching it for off of probably five acres, I remember when, get my telescope, and observed the object from our front yard.

5) Estimate how long you saw the object.    1 minute - Certain

6) What was the condition of the sky?    Bright Twilight

7) If you saw the object during daylight twilight or dawn with was the sun as you looked not to the object it - To my left

8) If you saw the object at night twilight, or dawn what did you notice concerning the stars and the moon?    Only the moon was visible in the western sky (at road dark during)

9) Was the object brighter than the dark sky card of the sky?    
    The object itself was not bright, then the background of the sky

10) Did the object:
    a) Appear to stand still sometime? - No
    b) Suddenly speed - speed with change? - No
    c) Blink or spark? - No
    d) Glow or shape? - No
    e) Change bright? - Yes


- page 6 -

Here is the text from the document:

1) Did the object move while watching at anytime?
    It moved slightly down to me.

2) Did the object appear: Solid?

3) And when others the object it might the following?
    Telescope - Yes

4) Tell what you saw about the object
    Sounds: No sound was heard
    Color: to green was dark metallic, light for the
    time of night, one could see, on the bottom of the obj't.

5) Have a picture, shall want, include

[Additional handwritten notes and diagram with text like:
- For about 10 min the object changed from deck of lights to a bright shiny one
- Wisconsin Highway 22
- This was indeed one of important in my life to be told

6) The shape of the object was: Fuzzy around but tight


- page 7 -

Here is the text from the document:

17) Give a picture that will show the materials of the mark
Question is about the path that the object takes

18) If possible, volume or age or speed
This will be accomplished from its distance and altitude
as we know it

19) You gave out the object opposite import with an object
itself and its length
The object could not be seen with a telescope. Very bright
points of white light which occurred alternately and
sometimes more actively, were the only sign of the
unidentified flying object. Its size, perhaps. The object
didn't seem to change attitude when these phenomena occurred.

20) How did the object disappear - from view?
The object passed behind some trees & then went
on its horizon.

21) Describe its construction.
It was a dark rather hazy solid looking object with
the large object on it. Nothing on or near it. It was
definitely elliptical, a "saucer" shaped object, with one
month-take two regular sauces and put them together.
One would then have a similar looking object. The object
was hazy, though, that I could not see one of the edges
lying on the latter, which might part of the object. *

22) Where were you when you saw the object?
The only place I saw the object itself was over our
field & only by means of a telescope.

* Note: to a height to adjust a point of view of the object

Here is the OCR text from the document:

3?) Now you understand?

My 1st interview yesterday at this time, you saw me by?
just previous to seeing the object I saw wing object with
a disappear to notice the type with my mother, and an
airplane had just glanced in the southern sky and I went
to our upstairs window to take a look I could see no
am night but suddenly the wind a slight on hills, from
(wing?) and although to myself and off was to be to
spinning extraordinary movement, possibly even the wind to
get it at this time I am describe it into one fixed
yet to element through my thing.

25) What direction were you looking when you first saw the
object? I was looking approximately NE by E.

26.) What direction were you looking when you last saw
the object? I was looking approximately NE tried

37) When it first appeared:
a) From Time North _ 15 degrees East
b) From Saigon about 10 degrees

When it disappeared:
a) From Time North about 45 degrees (west)
b) From Saigon _ 5 degrees

38) What was the weather condition when you saw the
object? Clouds with with temp about
a few bank low wind sky cool

39) This anyone else with you at the time you saw the
object? Yes, my mother saw only the first, but didn't
see the object distinctly


- page 9 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

30.) Was this the first time you had seen a UFO like this?
Yes - since that on May of 1964, I saw three unidentified
flying objects descend, to the ground I think of it now.

31.) In your opinion what do you think caused or could have
caused it?
- In my opinion I would choose the object was an inside
typed flying object - it came we not now.

32.) Can you estimate the speed or distance.
No distance is unknown, therefore saw the object was
with attitude.

33.) Facts:

there what I saw
Sact Feb 24 (1964)
It was like my attempt.

The people were just waiting the car, but it was

communicating, I was not dark.
