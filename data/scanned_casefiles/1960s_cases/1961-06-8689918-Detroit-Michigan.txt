1. DATE 6-8-61
2. LOCATION Detroit, Michigan 
3. INVESTIGATIVE GROUP
4. TYPE OF SIGHTING
□ Aircraft 
□ Astronomical
□ Ground-Visual
■ Ground-Radar
□ Airborne-Visual
□ Airborne-Radar
5. DESCRIPTION Bright, metallic colored object
6. COURSE Moving 6-10 mph, moved in a very erratic manner
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 20-3 minutes
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Ground observers of baseball game noticed object in sky. Radar operator at base confirmed presence of object. Object displayed very erratic flight characteristics and was tracked by radar for approximately 20-3 minutes. Final conclusion was that the sighting was unidentified, and was probably astronomical or related to a malfunction in the radar tracking system.
11. COMMENTS Two reports indicate the duration is very short. The radar observation, however, indicates the object was tracked for approximately 20-3 minutes, which strongly suggests an unidentified object. This is substantiated by the fact that the radar operator confirmed the presence of the object and its erratic flight characteristics.
