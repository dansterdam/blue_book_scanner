Here is the OCR text from the document:

11 NOV 61

The following is a report of a U.F.O. sighted at a point approximately 40 miles NNW of Dubuque Zone, 100 miles S of LaCrosse wire, and 90 miles SE of Madison Wis. near the town of Cassville, Wis.

I Tuesday, 7 NOV 61, the object was noted out 15-7 hours traveling S course approximately NW to SE. At was described in shape like two large rectangles, (both solid and outline), as rocket appeared with shape of an old fashioned lamp chimney.

At was observed moving in a SE direction for 15 minutes. Changed course to NE or 10 minutes, then changed to N. SE continued this direction for 2-3 minutes. At the end of this time it stopped. I was observed motion less for another 20 minutes, from 1150 to 1110 hours. During this motionless period, a beam leave was noted. The object was lost from sight in a 4 minute period while north western sky was faint.

Due to the fact that little info was gathered in the sky at time (illustrating story) the size and altitude could not be estimated, but will though to be comparable to a jet.

The mode of propulsion is as describedly its speed, with no complete halt to motion with apparent increase. At the time of motion, the object glowed with the intensity of a star (or less), but upon slowing and stopping the light increased to the point of being barely visible. Also at times the glow of the object was visible, the light increased without movement.

Continuing all times the "apparent" phenomenon was
going with good without movement), the estimated numbers
of time of occurrence is 15-100. The altitude seemed
to change with change of course, but not in a
significant manner.

At this same point, approximately 1 mile
another sighting was made. This sighting was
traveling in a track scene from ESE to WSW,
(very poor estimate).

The object appeared to be between 50,000
to 60,000 feet, based on the fact that a contrail
was seen distant was traveling over at the same
time at an estimated 13,000-17,000 feet) at a
speed of well above 6,900 m.p.h. (for far above
a definite to say, but became it seems highly
probable) yet an altitude of 6 to 9,000 m.p.h. It had
a totally yellow-white glow.

Please verify the receipt of the report at
your earliest convenience. This is with evidence
of the witness will be furnished upon request.

Sincerely,

[Signature area blacked out]
Cassville, Wis.
