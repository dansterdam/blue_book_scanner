Dear Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.,

I am writing you about a U.F.O. incident that happened to me about a month ago. It was a clear day, bright and sunny. I was walking along an alley, when my attention was drawn to a bright shiney object in the sky. It was about 250 ft. in the air, and about 100 ft. away from me. It couldn't have been a plane or jet because it made no sound whatsoever. There was one thing very strange, before it disappeared it let out a large column of smoke. Would you please write me and tell me what this thing is. Thank You.

Sincerely yours,
Rego Park, N.Y.

JUN 27 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This will reply to your letter of June 23, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of object often reported as UFO in the Project Blue Book reports we sent you on June 20, 1968.

Sincerely,

JAMES E. ALTMAN

Dear Project Blue Book

I have sighted a U.F.O.!
Don't tell me it isn't real. I took a look at
it from through my binoculars.
Here are the details:

Time 20 to 9:00 - P.M.
There were three witnesses:
Diane Ing, James Toal
and myself!

Description of the object: South
Size: It was the size of
a time to arms length!
Shape: There were two
points at points
Color: Bright orange.
It was a clear night.
There was no wind.
Date: Sunday, the 23 of June.
There was positively no sound and

had no wings. The speed
was 50 m.p.h. but I would
you politely send an investigation
or a letter giving me your
conclusions. I hope I well
be hearing from you. Thank
you.

Sincerely yours,
Rego Park, N.Y.

P.S.
I saw the sauce
in front of my
house. I had my
friends. They were close
to me. Thank you.

SAF-OIOC/Miss Turner/76526/June 25, 1968

JUN 25 1968

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter dated January 22, 1968, in which you recommended that orders be issued to shoot down any unidentified flying object (UFO) that would not communicate.

We must decline to follow your recommendation for a number of reasons. Of all sightings reported, the vast majority have been natural objects such as stars, meteors, satellites, and balloons; it would be infeasible to shoot down the first three categories, and no useful purpose would be served by shooting at the fourth category.

In addition, small private planes are sometimes reported as UFO's; often these planes carry no radios, and if one were shot down, a senseless tragedy would result. Furthermore, no unidentified flying object reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security.

Moreover, [redacted] the Air Force continues to extend an open invitation to anyone who feels that he possesses any evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles operating within the earth's space envelope to submit his evidence for analysis; so far, no one has done so.

Sincerely,

June 22, 1968

Dear Project Blue Book,

I want to thank you for sending me the information on U.F.O.'s. I think we are wasting our time to send the Air Force letters. The reason is because of the U.F.O. sightings near the Air Forces bases. These creatures may be planning to attack us right now.

I think the reason for all these sightings is because the creatures want to find out about our Defense System. Also if their ships can fly like we are told, then they could demolish us. So I think we should act now and put out an order to shoot any U.F.O. which will not communicate. I hope you will take this theory seriously.

I will expect an answer. Thank You.

Sincerely yours,
Mr. [redacted]

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

June16, 1968

Dear Project Blue Book,

I am writing you this letter because of my many sightings of U.F.O.

Here is a brief description of my encounter with a U.F.O., I was walking along my alley on a Sunday, when all of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a saucer. I stared at it for about 3 minutes. I estimate its height at about 250 feet in the air. It was about 150 to 200 feet away. I knew it couldn't be a jet or a plane, because of the way it flew. It was traveling at about 75 m.p.h. Also there was another strange thing about the saucer. It let out a thick cloud of smoke at just before it disappeared. It disappeared from sight in a instant. It also made no noise whatsoever. I hope you will give this incident a clear thinking over. Also if you find the time, to write me a letter giving me some possibilities on my incident. Also there were no witnesses except myself. Thank You.

Sincerely yours,
Mr.

Rego Park, New York.
