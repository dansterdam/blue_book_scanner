12 min

6. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
The object observed for approximately 12 minutes was a bright light which changed colors from white to yellow to green. It appeared to be hovering a few thousand feet above the water and after about 10 minutes of observation, it began to move in a sinusoidal type of pattern, climbing and descending slightly. The object then accelerated and disappeared from view.

11. COMMENTS
The object was clearly not a star, planet, or any other known astronomical body. The motion and observed changes in color were characteristics not associated with conventional aircraft. However, the object could not be conclusively identified and the nature of the sighting remains unexplained.
