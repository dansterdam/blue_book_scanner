10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    Sphere of very bright light, size of basketball, center was blue. Trail of blue flame, length about 3 times diameter of object. No actual length. Object similar to chewing ball 1/2 mich larger or like burning ball. Appeared 20° above horizon, azimuth about 180° from observer's position. Disappeared-elevation slightly below horizon, azimuth did not change. Object head downward in a straight vertical path. Instantaneous disappearance below horizon.

11. COMMENTS
    This object has all characteristics of a meteor. The possibility of its being the reentry of a satellite were checked and ruled out. No event occurred at the time and date. There is no evidence available which indicates that the object's light sighting was not a meteor.
