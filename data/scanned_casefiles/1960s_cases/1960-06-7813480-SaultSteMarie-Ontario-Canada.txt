10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Witness was taking motion pictures of the contrails in the sky when first noted in the form of parallel light rays. The light rays then appeared to form a rectangular light with the parallel rays still discernible and forming on both of the long sides of the rectangular image. As the frames progressed the rectangular image became circular and the parallel light rays were visible until the image was almost circular.

11. COMMENTS
It should be noted that contrails moved from top to bottom of the frame indicating motion in the camera. The image may have been caused by a lens aberration when the lens was exposed to the direct sunlight. Since contrails from high flying a/c could have been caused by the sonic-type boom could have been caused by the a/c passing through the sound barrier coincident with the appearance of the image.

1. Enclosed is a somewhat damaged 8 mm film which apparently shows a phenomenon of some type. Being as we have no qualified splicing personnel or equipment here, the film is forwarded to you for editing.

2. The film was taken by Mrs. the 7th of June, 1960, between 1100 and 1200 hours, Eastern Daylight Savings Time. The picture was taken in the rear yard of her home Ontario.

3. Mrs. was using a standard Brownie Kodak camera, 8mm. She was shooting through a normal lens without filter or shade. She was taking pictures of contrails when she got the apparent image of a disc-like phenomenon.

4. Mrs. was not directly aware of the disc until she got her film back from the processing laboratory, Canadian Kodak Co., Ltd., Toronto, Canada. However, she was aware of a bright object, silver in appearance, rapidly crossing her vision through the lens. The phenomenon's appearance was accompanied by a loud sonic-type boom which was heard by many people in the Sault Ste Marie area.

5. Also enclosed are four still enlargements of the object which were processed from a second print of the original film.

6. Mrs. would appreciate the return of the film when you have no further use for it. Please return it to this office, and it will be returned to her personally.

SUBJECT: Request for Photoanalysis                                   5 May 1961

TO: AFCIN-4b4a

1. It is requested that an analysis be made of the attached photographic prints and negatives to determine the nature of the images.

2. It is requested that the negative and prints be forwarded to AFCIN-4E upon completion of the analysis in order that they may be returned to the witness.

1. The attached motion picture film was carefully analysed and prints were made of the frames containing the image in question.

2. As Mrs. [redacted] was taking motion pictures of the contrails in the sky an image was first noted in the form of parallel light rays. The light rays then appeared to form a rectangular image with the parallel rays still discernable and forming on both of the long sides of the rectangular image. As the frames progressed the rectangular image became circular and the parallel light rays were visible until the image was almost circular.

3. It should be noted that the contrails moved from top to bottom of the frames indicating motion in the camera.

4. The image may have been caused by a lens aberration when the lens was exposed to the direct sunlight.

5. Since contrails from high flying aircraft were apparent the loud sonic-type boom could have been caused by the aircraft passing through the sound barrier coincident with the appearance of the image.

UFO Photographs (Memo)

Captain John W. Plantikow (IO)
Kinchelos AFS Base, Michigan

1. On 2 May 1961 your office forwarded to ATIC a roll of 8mm film taken by you at Maria, Ontario. This roll of film had frames which showed some type of phenomena of which the witness was not aware while taking the pictures.

2. The ATIC conclusion is that the disc-like phenomena shown on some of the frames was caused by lens aberration when the lens was exposed to direct sunlight. The boom which was heard by Mrs. A and others could possibly have been a sonic boom since jet aircraft were operating in the area.

3. Per your request the roll of 8mm film is forwarded to your office in order that you can return it to the [redacted].
