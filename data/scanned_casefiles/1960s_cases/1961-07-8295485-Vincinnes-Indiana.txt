Dear Sirs:

On the evening of July 21, 51 at 12:30 and 12:00 respectively, I was called as a witness. (to see a strange object in the sky over the Indiana) area. The appearance and course of this object was such that it could not have been an aircraft, helicopter, or any known aerial device, as it took off from its position in the horizon at an extremely high rate of speed. Here upon call, you will not receive this letter to a previous date so mentioned.

Yours,
