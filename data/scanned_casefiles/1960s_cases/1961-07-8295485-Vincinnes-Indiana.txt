Dear Sir:

On the nights of July 30, 31 at 12:30 and 12:00 respectively, I watched a white light (1st or 2nd magnitude) cross the sky going from the So.West to No.East.

The magnitude and time of this light resemble that of Echo however I thought that Echo was too deflected to be seen so well, Could you tell me whether this light is Echo or the body of some other satellite.

Yours,
[Redacted]
VINCENNES IND.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your recent letter addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been referred to the Air Force.

The ECHO satellite is somewhat misappraised from its original configuration; however, this has decreased its ability and can be seen almost as well as in its early life.

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
