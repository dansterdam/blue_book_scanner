Dear Miss ______

This is in reply to your recent letter requesting information on the sighted object on the night of 9 May 1965.

The object which you described had the characteristics of a satellite. We are familiar over Alabama at that time. Your letter stated that this object you observed settled in the western sky. If your observation is correct and you saw what you believe, this object could have been a satellite. I please note the time of your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Piedmont, Alabama, 4 May 65

28 MAY 1965

We have received a letter from Rt 3, Piedmont, Alabama, requesting identification of an object which she observed on the night of 4 May 65. The letter stated that the object rose from the northwest sky to a point directly overhead and proceeded to settle in the west. This object resembled a satellite. If her letter was in error regarding the disappearance and the object actually disappeared to the southeast, the an all probability the object was ECHO I. This satellite was over Alabama at 08:02 pm, at a high elevation angle. If Miss Chambers does not feel that the object was ECHO I, she should fill out an FTD Form 164 and return it to your office.

This was between 4:50 and 5:00 P.M. The object was observed through a telescope and field glasses and seemed to be a round, shiny, object. We were
