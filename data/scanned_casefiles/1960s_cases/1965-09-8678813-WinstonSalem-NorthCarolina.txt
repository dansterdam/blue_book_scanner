11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One object, brighter than a star, looked like inner circle or shape and outskirts of a blue corona like electrical discharge. Slight flight. No details. Passed overhead. View at an angle. No sound. Small. Appeared to come from over the horizon. In shape in spread on night sky. Spent about 15 to 20,000 ft. Observed from inside a building through screen. Conflicting data between report and elevation and duration. Object inconsistencies between speed, elevation and duration. Object revealed its position 15 deg above horizon in 10-15 seconds, yet witness was able to give detail of two concentric circles and view this detail.

Myrtle Beach NC 29762
1 Sept 1965

Dear Sir:

This morning at 9:45 p.m. E.S.T. at not long after sunset, while sitting in my back yard, I noticed to the North East a strange light between 30° and 90° above the horizon. Approximately 330° from my position. When I was ground, it appeared to be a very bright star-like object of special size. For perhaps 15 minutes, I watched it move slowly for several minutes off to the North East, approximately 50-60 ft. up, to a point in space as bright light can in model man II

10 > 10-15 ft. size off 1-60 x 125.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]
