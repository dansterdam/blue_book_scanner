INFORMATION ONLY

Observer noted object in the west southwest at shortly after mid-
night. Object appeared to be moving very slowly. Observer watched
object for about 15 minutes and left; object being still visible.

Observer went back outside about 0100, 6 Oct 66 to look for object.
At this time object had moved slightly to the right and downward.
Object had moved about 6 inches from original position. White was
the predominant color observed. At 0300 observer again tried to find
the object but at this time object had disappeared.

Observer was questioned about sighting. She thought it might
have been a satellite. She had never seen a satellite previously.
Movement puzzled her and then when she went back outside at 0300 and
the object disappeared she became concerned. She wasn't reporting
an UFO just an unusual light.

CONCLUSION

Witness was more than likely observing the star Altair. At
0015 EST Altair was on an azimuth of 269 degrees and at an elevation of
16 degrees. At 0100 EST Altair was at an azimuth of 275° and at an
elevation of 8° at 0300 Altair would not have been visible to the
observer because it set at approximately 0200 EST. Altair being a
bluish - white star appears to be what the observer witnessed.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

to nearly its original height, tipped up one side and becoming brighter, sped away
to the SE at about a 35 degrees angle. Total time of sighting estimated a 45 seconds.

Departuer time estimated approx. 3 or 3 seconds.

Myrtle Bailey hung up the phone and went out on a small side porch to see what the
kids may have been talking about. She thinks she watched the object for nearly 5 minutes.
She and Eric Miller and company must have watched the object at the same time from
different observation points after it returned from speeding off while the children
watched. Mrs. Bailey described the object as almost round, big as a wash tub, almost as
bright as the sun, soundless, self luminous, and fuzzy edged. She said it seemed to have
a top like an iron that you iron clothes with or a submarine conning tower and on top
of this had a periscope sticking up. She said it sometimes appeared like two saucers
together and around the bottom had places that looked like hammered aluminum. (This
occurred when the object dropped down to its lowest point and wobbled in the air probably.)
She thought the object stopped still but Eric Millers sighting indicates the true move-
ment. The 30 or 85 degree angle she viewed it probably made lowering or rising more
difficult to realize.

She said the underside lit up like the color of a kerosene lamp flame, and the
thing began to move picking up speed, leaving behind a sort of mist or light fog where
it had been. Then rapidly becoming smaller and diminishing to a dot it disappeared in
an estimated 5 seconds. Departing SE at about a 45 degree angle.

The Tushville Police recorded her call at 8:00 he did not answer the call as they
were busy on a murder case. Her nephew Capt. Dick Fea said its the first time she has
ever called the police in her life.

No planes were up from the local airport. No fairs or carnivals with search lights
were operating near the town. Two flying boxcars from the Army airfield at Columbus Ind.
went over about a half hour later.

Rushville Sighting

Persons who made observation: (ten in all)
Myrtie Bailey RR 1, Rushville, Ind. Age 64, Housewife.
Eric Miller, 528 N. Parkings St., Rushville, Ind. Age 15, Summer employee of American Fractions Inc. Ind'n. polis. Junior in High School.
Donna Gosser, RR 2, Rushville, Age 11, 5th Grade.

Four High School boys from New Castle who observed the object with Eric Miller.
(They had returned to New Castle and were not available for questioning.)

Dirk Paugh, Age 10. Douglas Gosser Age 9, Tommey Gosser Age 7. These boys observed the object for about 15 seconds when it was about one city block away.

Time of Observation: Monday Aug. 1, 1966, 7:30 to 8:00 P.M. Sun setting, moon not up yet, no stars, dusk.

Locality: South East of Rushville Ind. Near State Road 52 at a suburb know as Circleville.

Sky Conditions: Partly cloudy, the clouds were to the west and north clear of the area of the sighting.

Narrative:
Donna Gosser just happen to look up from the road where she was playing with Tommey Gosser and saw the object almost directly overhead filling a space between the top limbs of a maple trees. She watched it for about half a minute then yelled to Dirk Paugh and Douglas Gosser who were down the road half a block on their bicycles.

Donna described the object as almost round, brighter than the moon, glowing silver, solid with fuzzy edge, making no sound, and four times the size of a full moon up high. She said it stood still but rocked a little in the air. As she yelled to her friends the object suddenly changed to a reddish or orange color mostly on the outer edge of the bottom, seemed to revolve, slowly tilted over high or 52 and in no more than 2 seconds and came to an instant stop about one block south over a house on a hill. Her friends joined her and watched for an estimated 15 secs before the object suddenly zipped southward becoming smaller and disappeared in an estimated 5 seconds.

Everyone ran into Donna's nearby home all excited and yelling to Donna's mother about what they had seen. The mother Jean Bailey Gosser was on the phone talking to her mother Myrtie Bailey who resides 100 yards down the road. The ladies continued to talk and one remarked "why don't they come down and have coffee with us?" Jean Gosser never went out.

Eric Miller and four newly met acquaintances from New Castle were at the Dairy Delight drive-in about one mile from the area of the sighting. Eric had just looked at his watch and saw it was 7:45 and he was due home. He described the object as having a grayish metallic shine with a faint glow on top, he could not see the bottom. Also self luminous, fuzzy at the edges, it was in the shape of a flat oval about the size of a dime held at arms length. It did not remain motionless but had a little side slip while hovering.

When first observed it was well above some tall trees but rapidly dropped down until it was behind the very top of the tall trees between it and the observer. The object went out of sight but the glow from the top could be seen. Then it suddenly arose back

Here is the OCR text from the document:

was elliptical in shape, a little smaller than the moon, a reuish neaulus floating thing. he thought it sewed to move toward than receded from the observer at 2 second intervals, growl g larger then smaller. (pulsating?). when the light on the electric stove w s turned on said object dimmed down. This was not verified by the others.

Son rushed into other room to call local police. Object suddenly moved off in a level 55 direction, diminished in size to a little round grey dim light and vanished from sight. Its time to accomplish this was estimated at 3 or 4 seconds. Son rushed down to the State Police Post some 2 miles distant and reported the incident there. They said let the city police handle it. City police finally drove down road nearly half an hour later. I met the officer later and he said " This guy call up all excited and says there was a fiery circle over his house. Hell, I didnt see anything. I dont believe in those things. "

Analysis;
An average sighting.
It is possible son is mist ken about object reacting to car and stove lights.
From my list of possible identities;
Moon - not up yet.
Ball lighting- Not in the size due tion or movement.
Search light on clouds - None in area, would not be fiery orange or be in the clouds out on this.
Stellar mirage or halo thru clouds - object too bright and wrong color for this. Also
it would not move off and disappear in 3 or 4 secs.
Reflection of city colored light on clouds- some other reason above. Also reflection
is not so certain but could cover larger area.
Hallucination - These were all good level headed sound of mind persons.

Conclusion; UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT.

Connersville Sighting

Persons who made observation:
Mr. Wm. T. Murray, 385, Connersville, Ind. Age 52, Electrical Maintance local factory.
Mrs. Magrat Murray, 385, Connersville, Ind. Age 50, Housewife.
Stanley Murray, 385, Connersville, Ind. Age 20, Part time industrial plant guard and University student.
Miss Linda Currie, Columbus, Ind. Age 19, University student. ( not available for questioning)

Time: Monday, Aug. 8, 1966, at 12:20 AM.
Locality: 2 miles SE of the Triangle, a suburb SE of Connersville, Ind.
Object in view: Stanley approximately 8 minutes, others approx. 7 or 7 minutes.
Sky conditions: Partial low cumulus cloud cover, average darkness visibility, no moon, stars seen occasionally, no wind.

Narrative:
Stanley pulled into drive of isolated farm house. He noticed a funnev looking moon in the sky B-33 at 40 or 50 degrees elevation. He gave it no more thought and went into the house. He had forgotten his books so had to return to the car. Now noticed the moon had moved somewhat from where he had first noticed it. He studied the strange moon and claims it dimmed when he opened the car door and the door light came on. He claims the object brightened when he shut the car door. I pointed out that perhaps the effect of the dome light in his eyes or perhaps the clouds partially moving over the object had made it appear that way. He doesn't think so, but was not as certain about cloud interference.

Now convinced it was no moon, he rushed into the house where all were in bed. Excitedly called out " Now dont get excited, keep the lights out and come and look at this thing." All hurried to the back kitchen door to watch the luminous object in the bottom of the clouds. Asked why no one went into back yard to look, wife confessed to fear of the strange object. The son said girl friend Linda was afraid and did not want him to go out. Linda, left at the house alone several days later, locked all the doors in broad daylight.

Some clouds always around or under the object made it difficult to tell the exact shape. To the father the object seemed elliptical (football or egg shaped), almost as bright as a full moon, a fiery reddish orange color or like an arc light. He seen flame fingers briefly on the left had side once. The object seemed to brighten and then dim (pulsate). To the mother the object appeared a blunt cone shape, larger than a full moon, bright orange in color, seemed to pulsate and just sat there in the sky. To the son the

I was wired out in yard that afternoon & was sitting on step, looked up & as if hypnotized stared 'caused head to point up at a if it had eyes & saw me it shot toward me. Seemed very terrific speed - very clear easy.

It heard noise early afternoon but probably wasn't connected. Also saw white light red light behind us for several miles than very sudden about of us. Not sure through wire some lights. Actually feel there could be some possible explanation for it.

Large red solid light suspended in sky, no sound, reflected in wire nearby & I. After the first incidents & since I was home alone & I didn't take the chance to get to safety which was neighbor's house across street since they find lights on but they went home afterward.

I hadn't read anything but one article in Reader's Digest a couple years ago so when we saw the object I thought I was one of very few people to see it. St. News bothered my husband & interest. He never actually believe that I would go up in one & come down & probably never think about it again. I was afraid though 4 half 7 nights I was afraid to go to sleep. time I think about it. Every at I get very nervous. Especially when I read the air force claiming we're all liars at is frustrating to know the truth & yet not convincing anyone.

Dear Sirs;

On monday October 16, 1966 I was playing with other friends dogs in the athletic field behind den house. At about 7:20 PM I looked up at the constellation of Pegasus and saw entry. Bright after quite under, the square of Pegasus. A few minutes later I looked up again and the object had moved from a position on the south west horizon to a point just under Aries. I then walked down the field and watching the object all the time. A few minutes later at about 7:25 PM the object when below the north west horizon. The movement of the object was from south west to north east. The movement was slow and steady and the light given off by the object was steady and even. There was no vapor trail or sound get off and there was no burning effect as in a meteorite. During the time I saw the object three jets went over going to land a Newark airport. They gave off no light like the object.

I do not think it was a small airplane because I have seen many small airplanes flying at night at the Princeton Airport and the object did not look like a small aircraft.

Personnel interview with Neil Gallomore of Bowersville, Ohio revealed the following:

The alleged UFO has landed between route 73 and 128 for three straight nights and hovered over the ground for a forth night. On the forth night the object hovered about 1000 feet off the ground. 4 boys went up to about 100 yards from the object. The object was making a beeping sound at this time. As the boys approached the object they shined a flashlight at the object. All of a sudden the object shined a light back at the boys. The boys then turned and ran.

The object was banana shaped and red in color. There were lights on the landing gear. Also visible were red, green, and white lights. On all four the object was visible from 2130 to 2200 hours. The sheriff and some other men were keeping the crowd away from the object. Mr. Gallomore never saw the object except on one night he saw a white light slowly move toward the SE. The sheriff gave Mr. Gallomore a bum steer.

Also at the scene of the dighting there was grass smashed down but there were no burnt marks, Gallomore said that he thought the sighting should be reported even though it was about a week late. He called Clinton County AFB on Saturday and they told him that they would contact MP AFB about the sightings.

18 Oct. 66

Contact was made with Major Wilson Clinton County AFB, Ohio regarding the observation of UFOs over the Hillsboro area. The only report that they had received was from a Mr. Gallomore who called and asked if the base knew of the sightings. The actual observers did not report the observation to the Air Force. Major Wilson said that from time to time the Army has maneuvers in the area. He said that if could be possible that this people involved could have seen a chopper landing. Major Wilson did not know of any definite activity that was going on at the time.

I thought it might be a rocket but I not
resemble the ones I have seen going up
while I lived at Indialantic, Florida which
is just south of Cape Kennedy. I also noted
out motions because the movement was very
slow and not very fast like the big one that
went overhead last June which I saw. I think
it might be a satellite but my point told
me they don't move from south to north.
The satellites I have seen were small points
of light in the sky but this one was brighter
then the brightest star. The sky was
completely clear during the entire sighting
and the temperature was in the low 60's.
I would like it very much if you could
tell me what it was because I did not look
like a rocket, meteorite, or satellite, all
which I have seen at night.

Sincerely yours,

the information of a sighting on a close object to the ground I will report it to you I'm getting contact with you in seconds you can pick this up. With some device that I could get a good reading I would be off more than glad to help you. My parents are thinking of buying a pair of good binoculars for me and I could borrow a high powered telescope, but that takes to long to arrange it into order and I am out of luck.

In spite form you sent the FTD form my father wouldn't let type this information in the form. the form is on its way to you. Inquiring if you desire and this letter I still will be looking and watching. My time is put in watching these things and not letting anyone of importance know it hurts me. I promise no one will know about this. I have more to tell if you are interested. I will also a little time for you to decide on what to do. I write this letter in study hall at school, so my parents won't know about it. If you decide to do anything let me know. My address is

Hillsboro, Ohio

Dear Gentlemen:

I am the boy who with fourteen others saw the other night on October 15, 1966, the unidentified observation. The same thing appeared on Friday night October 21st. By now I think you should have the report, but to aid with it, I to saw it. I was going to report it to you instantly, but my cousin down in Pictoria, Ohio phoned and told me that not over twenty minutes he had saw one come within 20 degrees from where he was. He told me it was about the size of a dime. Since then people from all over the county have called me on strange sightings in a few years.

The main reason I am writing is because I spent many hours at night watching these things. Every clear night with maybe a few clouds is the best time to watch. Watching these UFO's play tag, or watch them do their crazy eight patterns is a sight to see. But the worst thing is watching airplanes coming over and seeing these UFO's come down a play with the plane and then disappear.

Here is the text from the document:

"...This all I can see from where I live on a high elevation just right out of Hillsboro. I know from what I have seen that if they were something else, how could so many of these things be within a twenty-five to fifty mile radius. Watching these lights go on and off and seeing these objects move around on the sky and looking like it is trying to be something else is amazing. Anyone if anyone asks me if I seen any in the last couple days I just refuse to answer. Besides seeing these two at close distance there has been at least two more, I have seen within the last month at this place. I then too wonder if these were what I have been seeing. My father is stubborn and thinks I am nuts, but I refuse to take that as an answer.

If you wish I could watch for these things and watch the Air Force Data of some kind. I can record these things. I'm in you need of a camera to take these pictures if anything come in close like these sightings. I know you could get some good pictures and some information on these things. If I can get"

Dear [redacted]

Reference your letter reporting an unusual object sighted by you and your friends on October 10, 1966.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force in October 1966, an evaluation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

I have attached some material on this subject which I think you will find interesting.

During the duration of the object, several people in turn reported interference of their television broadcasting. We all felt definitely that no helicopter entered a left the area. Apart from the wind of high and low "electronic" sound, the object made no noise. When it moved, no noise could be heard.

When we shined a flashlight at the vicinity of the object and called to it, it responded with more regular flashing. When we started to approach the object, the flashing became constant and very regular - at intervals of approximately one-half second. It did so in pointed with more electronic sound.

After reading the article on Flying Saucers in the Picture Magazine (today's) something preyed(preyed) on my mind. One night around October 16, 1966 3 friends of mine and I were working on a science project outside, and we saw what we thought was a UFO. It was made up of red, green, and blue lights (on a disk-shaped background) and it flashed each and forth. Valerie Ulstad's father agreed with us that this whatever-this-is could be a UFO.

Grafton, West Virginia
November 2, 1966

Air Force Systems Command
Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sir:

The undersigned submits the following information to you which has been given to me by a resident of Grafton, West Virginia. An adult, 39 years of age, public service number [redacted]

[redacted] stated to the undersigned that while enroute to her place of employment at Fairmont, West Virginia, from her residence in Grafton, at approximately 5:55 a.m. DST, October 12, 1966, she did observe the following: A light moving in the sky at a low altitude which appeared to her at first to be a jet aircraft. She stated it had a red flame approximately three feet to the rear of the craft and was gliding toward the Earth. She was of the opinion that it was going to crash. She further stated that she applied her brakes not knowing whether she completely stopped the vehicle or reduced to a slow rate of speed. She watched the object descend over the crest of a large hill and into the valley to her right. She stated that the object was close enough now that she could see it had no running lights such as those found on aircraft and that the object had no wings.

Her description of the object is as follows: Approximately 20 feet in diameter, round in structure, and three to four feet in thickness at its thickest point. She stated it was gliding off a soft bluish glow. No other lights were visible with the exception of the flame from the rear as previously described.

She stated that she became alarmed and frightened when she realized that she was seeing an object that she had only read and heard about previously. She watched the object as it glided into the valley. It stabilized itself hovering or moving very slowly, parallel with her vehicle. Her direction of travel at that time was West on U.S. route 50.

Proposed reply to letter from Jaimie Boone, 12 March 1967

Dear [blacked out]

Reference your recent letter reporting an unusual observation by you and your friends on 10 October 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force in October 1966, an evaluation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

[Handwritten note]
I have enclosed some material on the subject, which I think you will find interesting.

UFO SIGHTINGS #2.
FM: 15th AF Det 1 Fresno, Calif.

Ann Watson was told by Mr Dick Schilmilhorn from FRESNO that two TV Engineers (MR Emory Milburn) & MR Scott at a TV broadcast sight 40 miles East of Castle AFB has seen a UFO.

The object was sighted on an azimuth of 150 from top of 4500 ft tower 3 miles (12,13, & 14th Oct.) in a row from 1945L to 2020 Local. Sighting was "visual" and with binoculars.

The object is large and circular. It has bright white lights will reddish tint that revolve around the object. The UFO is large than a normal aircraft. It normally hovers but moves vertically and horizontally. It depicts radically when an aircraft passes by, but then returns to (clear) original position and hovers.

Several Goose Hill residents have seen it, also.

Dear Gentlemen:

During the October month, I and my friend, witnessed a series of UFO sightings.

One of the earliest sightings was seen by. This occurred during the month of July. The time was approximately 9:00p.m. she, with two other girls, an object, zoomed by above the school building, and headed southeast. It had no blinking lights, and made no noise. When the girls saw it, they paniced and ran away, and therefore unable to observe other details.

In the month of October, was when we witnessed the many UFO sightings. One night approximately 9:30 P.M., my friend and I were in my dark room, we had no lights on. As we were singing, I happened to glance out of my window. I saw a large object approximately 50 feet above the neighbors house. Since and I were both interested in UFO's, I immediately called her attention to it and said, do you think it's one? Then, we both suddenly KNEW it was one, I called my father and, on doing so I ran out to the back yard with Carol.

When I did so, it was gone. No trace at all, no fumes in the air, nothing, not even a hum.

Later that night, after and gone home, I stood out in the balcony with my two sisters. The little one (age 8) and said, is that a UFO? My sister, (age 16) and both looked at was an object with red blinking lights and a constant white light. We could not determine the shape. Suddenly, it did and amazing thing: it shot up in the air with incredible speed. Although we live very close to an Air Base, I know, they are not advanced enough to have a vehicle with that speed.

Around the last week of October, [redacted] and I were walking along a darkened alley. Time: 10:30 p.m. We were looking up at the stars. Suddenly, spotted a satellite (or presumed) "but this satellite had double lights!" This still remains an objective in my mind: Was it or wasn't it?

The first week of November, I had just come back from the movies with my mother. When I spotted a satellite, I showed it to my mother. However, this one had and extraordinary brighter light than others I had seen. Then, the satellite (?) stopped in mid air. The time: 10:00 P.m.

Sirs, I live in the Azores. Since not only I but many of my friends have spotted numerous UFO's, I feel that you could find something extra if you established an observatory here on the Lajas Air Force Base. Any information will be given readily by me.

Also, could you please send me some more information on your Project Blue Book, and how I might help you with any of my ideas possible?

Thank-you,

Dear Gentlemen:

During the October month, I, [redacted] and my friend, [redacted] witnessed a series of UFO sightings.

One of the earliest sightings was seen by [redacted]. This occurred during the month of July, the time was approximately 9:00 p.m. She, with two other girls, was near the school building, and noticed an object, zoomed by above the school building projecting from around the southeast. It had various antenna projecting from around the object. It had no blinking lights, and made no noise.

When the girls saw it, they panicked and ran away, and therefore unable to observe other details.

In the month of October, was when we witnessed the many UFO sightings. One night, approximately 9:30 P.M., my friend and I were in my dark room, we had no lights on. As we were singing, I happened to glance out of my window. I saw a large, oblong, approximately 50 feet above the neighbors house.

Since [redacted] and I were very much interested in UFO's, I immediately called [redacted] attention to it and said, do you think it's one? Then, we both suddenly knew it was one, I called my father and, on doing so, I ran out to the back yard with Carol. When I did so, it was gone. No trace at all, no fumes in the air, nothing, not even a hum.

Later that night, after [redacted] had gone home, I stood out in the balcony with my two sisters. The little one (age 8) frantically pointed to an object on a faraway hill (1 mi.) and said, "Look, is that a UFO?" My sister, (age 16) and I both looked. It was an object with red blinking lights and a constant white light. We could not determine the shape.

Suddenly, it did and amazing thing: it shot up in the air with incredible speed. Although we live very close to an Air Base, I know, they are not advanced enough to have a vehicle with that speed.

Dear Sir:

I am writing to you at the time because I could not think of anyone else who would believe me. About eight weeks ago, I, that is my sister and I were outdoors running around. It was fairly dark when we decided to go in. It was about 6:30 or 7:00 in the evening, and since it gets dark here in Iceland very early, we decided to come in. Just as we were almost home, I was looking over the sky to see if I could see any stars in my telescope. The sky was clear, and there was no moon. Every thing was perfect & still. I was talking to my sister when we both heard a sharp, humming sound. We were about home now & we both looked over the little town of Keflavik, about 4 a half of a mile from where we live. It was something I know that it was a machine or anything like that. I looked something to the effect of being like the living

Reference your letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object over the town of Keflavik, Iceland. Your observation was indeed interesting, however, it would be extremely difficult to investigate your sighting since it occurred outside the continental limits of the United States. Also there has been a time lapse since you observed the object. Your sighting will be filed for information purposes.

The above letter was intended to go to [redacted], however, he gave an incomplete address.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

The President has asked that I reply to your letter of October 1 concerning the aerial object you and your husband observed at approximately 9:30 p.m. October 1.

Possibly, you saw "Echo 2" or another satellite or object in an earth orbit. Echo 2 position over Alaska (East of Martin Point) at 9:15 p.m. October 1 was 140 degrees West, 70 degrees North. Based on the apogee and perigee of the satellite, Echo 2 probably would have been visible not longer than 10 minutes.

It is possible that you viewed some other man-made object in orbit. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge, Mass., reports that there are more than 50 satellites, satellite components, rocket particles or debris in orbit and visible at various times. Some of these objects are in an orbit higher than Echo 2 and therefore visible longer than 10 minutes.

We hope this information is helpful.
Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

Several times on the past month several people have spotted odd objects flying in the sky. They say they were flying saucers.

Until tonight I wouldn't believe them.

Tonight my husband, another couple & I saw something (it looked like a bright slow) going due our island. It was traveling from the South-East going into the North-West.

What I would like to know is, if possible: Was there a satellite flying on that course at 9:30 P.M. on October 1, 1966.

We live on the Southern

Here is the text from the document:

and of Hockinson Ballard
in Southeastern Alaska.
The object probably passed
directly over Brine of Whalen
Island. It was quite a
distance up. We looked at
it thru glasses but
could not distinguish anything
other than it looking like
a bright star.

I would very much appreciate any information you
could give me concerning
this "thing".
Thank you.

A 10 SOUTHWEST OF ORANGE SIGHTING

Persons making sighting:
Rushville, Ind. Age 20, Employed -International Furniture Co
10 grade.

Glenwood, Ind. Age 22, Employed B-X Co Connersville, Education
10 grade.

Date of sighting: Sat. Sept. 24, 1966 at approx. 8:30 PM
Sky conditions: Clear warm dark night, no moon, no wind, normal night time visibility.
Total time seen: approx. 45 minutes.

Note- The object observed appeared as 3 brilliant flashes of approx. one second duration
each and with approx. one second time interval between each flash. To be seen at the
instant of the flash was a glowing fiery reddish orange sphere surrounded by a zone of
brilliant white light approx. 1/3 that much larger still. The center globe seemed about
the size of a volley ball out since the distance was not known the true size cannot
be known accurately. The witnesses were never able to discern any shape or form, just the
glows of brilliant light on the flash.

Witnesses were southbound on the Orange Pike which is located in the southeast corner
of Fayette County. When about 1/2 mile southwest of Orange this strange eerie light flashed
three times more the trees some distance away. The witnesses continued on southward and
the first glove later it slid to in off over a field near the Wilson Pike. On this occasion
one witness saw it out across the field slightly to the rear, but her boy friend who was
driving knew it had flashed because it illuminated the road ahead much further than his
headlights. On the third occasion they stopped at the intersection of Wilson Pike and
Pike Road 52 turned out the car lights and watched. It flashed its three familiar brilliant
flashes for a position over a field between and behind a house and a small barn and in
front of woods for 2 or 3 blocks to the rear. It seemed closer to them and appeared
larger than a skyscraper, was very brilliant and illuminated the sky, woods, field,
buildings etc. His closer approach made one witness to use his description "Eerie". He
stepped on the gas and left the scene.

Now this was the female witnesses second encounter with this strange thing. Her previous
meeting took place during the last week in April in the same area when with her now
divorced husband. Apparently the object was a way to cross curiosity out
not far. At least not in these witnesses who are at that young and driving age and wanted
to find out what it was. The mysterious glove played a fantastic game of hide and seek with
them. It was last seen in the same area last night and the night before. It would come
out, was noticed that it would come closer when they turned out their lights. Another thing
noticed was this silence of the country area. In future night structures were seen.

Witnesses told their parents and relatives this fantastic story. Only the parents
believed them. Don Morley, a reporter, investigated the case and talked to the
witnesses.

CAMERON SIGHTING

Persons making sighting:
Dennis Cameron, 46, Rushville, Ind. Phone 932-2305, Employed - Produce Clerk, Kroger
Co., Junction- High School
Other witness wife- Judy Cameron, age 20, house wife.

Date of sighting: Oct. 8, 1966 at approx. 10:00 PM
Locality of observation: SE of home on State Road 44 west of Rushville Ind.
Sky conditions: Clear, no moon.

Total time object seen: Estimated 6 minutes. Sound heard estimated 15 or 20 seconds by
two witnesses. Other brother Dennis Cameron, sister in law Cameron and sister in law
Nancy Iserigg.

Narrative:
Wife heard what she disclosed as a screaming sound. She looked out the window and seen
a blinking red light going southeast at approx 70 degrees elevation. Sister in law in next
house west experienced TV interference when the sound was heard. The Cameron TV was on and
they do not recall any interference on it. Dennis described the sound as a whistling sound
of moderate volume, and no other sound was heard. He looked out three windows of the home
and seen a red and white light side by side. They were about the same as an ordinary light
seen from a distance. He run upstairs to get a better look at the lights. The lights did not
blink and seem to be hovering above a field in a SE direction, barely above the tree tops.
He and his wife watched the lights as they hovered there always keeping the same brightness
and position for an estimated 6 minutes. Some police dogs in a pen next door put up a howl,
but they often howl. Suddenly the lights started moving in what seemed to be a straight up
direction. In an estimated 7 seconds he lost sight of them. He came downstairs and he and
his brother got their guns and went out across the field in the direction the lights were
seen. He said they were looking for prowlers (having been bothered with that lately.) and
"anything else".

To my fellow earthmen,

The enclosed East Connersville Landing shook me up somewhat, and I don't shake easily after some of the amazing things I have found out. I think I am mad because the sneaky little boogers got away with it so nicely. No more swamp gas jokes-- I know you are under strict orders and would be shot at sunrise if you let anything slip. I know that when another so called air force spokesman at WPAFB speaks up another fantastic "swamp gas" explanation, its not our true air force speaking. The stupid bumbling roll you are forced to play must be as bitter as gall in your mouth.

Enclosed are all my sightings that amount to much except one I haven't as yet checked for fact or fiction. I have identified about 10 and threw out about 15 due to limited information or witness unreliability. I have been busier then a cat on a hot tin roof for four months. I hope something here is useful to my side. I don't get any answer(as usual) or have the envelope returned I'll assume you got them.

It looks like its cowboys and indians all over again--- this time we are the indians.

Dear Sir,

I know I wont get any answer to this but feel like I should write it anyway. You never know when some of the information may be useful. I am a fellow who investigates sightings of these non existent flying objects (UFO) over here in this section of Indiana. I am practically in your pocket being just 60 air miles west by a little southwest.

I am just now digging out of a wave of sightings that hit in October. I guess you know what I mean, you have the radar. I have approximately 15 persons who have been very close observers, 25 who seen shape, and 75 who seen lights or a light. I have ignored the fun makers, weariness, a peeved wife, and all the other obstacles and achieved my goal of finding out all that was humanly possible during the wave. Probably you couldn't care less but if I have anything that would be of interest to you, maybe for radar-visual comparison you are welcome to it. I KNOW ALL THE TWENTY YEARS OF "SWAT" OUR EXPLANATIONS ARE NOT THE TRUE AIR FORCE THINKING. If I didn't think so, knowing what I know, I would be scared to death. If you got any single blips for the nights of Oct 5 or 21 that were snoping around the Federal Micro Wave Relay Tower and Telephone relay Tower area. (One made a second visit the same night.

If on Oct. 10 about 4:00 am you got five strange acting blips this way. You would never guess their shape.

On Oct 6 starting at 9:59 P until 1:00 you should have had at least several low widely so ring hovering, giving blips in this area. I think the two planes you finally sent were too low.

Sometime during the middle of October some farmers got excited about some of your radar chaff that I have enclosed in this letter. They found some around this 5 inch flat and hard on the bottom hole with two other indications making a triangle. At least they outlined the holes were there. I didn't get to see them because of the destruction of snow, rain and fog. Some of the AF chaff was suppose to be found south of town in the area where the citizens and radio owners first started tracking their UFO. I think it is safe out it isn't the entire thing should be snacked into water.

On the evening of 21 Oct. your radar should not have really been cluttered in this direction. This are which will give you some ideas. (Several hand-drawn symbols/sketches appear here which are partially cut off)

A little later I approached some fairly significant UFO objects. Those things just were very tough. About possible (Area) 21, I know you will file all sightings, but thought perhaps I might be able to do something for my side. I can put form and relative to some radar blips.

Your Friend,

and not a l. legged cow. " Obs. B said " It sounded like a person walking slowly. There
was the crash of weeds and stubble and a faint pop. It never got any louder. I was scared
and my heart was pounding. we look off as a fast as we take now I would go,and rigged up John St.
rack and rock. " Obs. B said " I had cold chills in my spine and now down come until
we got to Vine St. I finished the rest of my route carefully fast that morning. I felt like
something might be watching me." Obs. B said " I was too scared to care if I made a bad
throw at a peach with a paper. I felt like something out there may have seen me." when he
was asked where he looked for his enemy he said " Everywhere -ground or air."

Concerning the walking sound we have the following possibilities;

A. Something human-like with two legs was walking. If so it may not have been too far distant
because this type of sound is not audible beyond a certain distance. It is not known if
dew was on the weeds or not.

B. Some type of machinery which started up on the object.

C. It was imagination on the boys part.

D. A cow walking in the field. (animals are terror stricken near these objects. Obs. B
stated that he heard the sound of cattle down near the barn to the south. Both were
certain it didn't sound like a cow walking.)

E. Wind or a light breeze. (It was a still morning.)

For the most part the boys were met with nearly total disbelief when they excitedly
related what had happened once home. Obs. B's mother said he was sure wound up and excited
when he got home. She thought he was exaggerating something he had seen by adding something
from TV or one of his books. He told his scout troop and although not all disbelieved it
was decided it was best to remain quiet. Obs. A's sister in law and her mother did take
seriously his days of very excited talk about the event. He was urged to call me.

On the evening of the 5th. after school Obs B's brave in daylight, returned to the
scene and soon discovered the three strange holes and also noticed the faint sulphur
smell again. He also noticed a small spot of light red dirt like material about 6 feet
away from the three holes. But he didn't pay much attention to it being more interested in
the holes. He also looked briefly for some holes left by the object on the first morning
he noticed it. He looked in a southward direction out point see anything. On its first
night there the object must have been quite close to the 2 strand barbed wire electric
fence which runs across the field. Is it possible something got a "knock"?

During the next several days trips were made to the spot with friends and the holes
were examined, felt and discussed. On Sunday the only adult to see the holes Obs A's
27 year old sister in law, took her camera and forever recorded absolute proof on film
that the holes actually existed, a were there. (Obs attached photographs.) She looked for
any vehicle trucks and there were none. Even the cattle had swished the area. The holes seen
on the edge of the hole in a close up hole is seen that Obs A dog out from the bottom of
the hole where it had fallen.

A telephone survey of the area near the sighting has not revealed any other witnesses.

EAST CONNERSVILLE LANDING

Observers to the event:
Name kept confidential. Henceforth known as Observer "A", age 14, Education-Freshman, Senior High, Member Boy Scout Troop, Newspaper Carrier, Interested in Science. He is an intelligent and trustworthy boy.(See attached personal character statements from Pastor, Science Teacher, and Scout Leader.)

Name kept confidential. Henceforth known as Observer "B", age 13, Education- 9th. Grade Junior High, Member Boy Scout Troop, Newspaper Carrier, in Radio Control Club, Interested in Astronomy. He is an intelligent and trustworthy boy. (See attached personal character statements from Sunday School Teacher, President Plano Club,and Scout Leader.)

Time of Observation: Wed Oct 5, 1966 at approximately 5:30 or 5:45 AM.
Locality of Observation: East Connersville, Ind. Seen by witnesses who stood at the end of John St. and viewed object in a field to SW of there.See attached drawing of area.

Weather Conditions and Visibility: Near total darkness, cool and cloudy, no wind, no mist or fog, no rain four previous days.
Total time seen: From 2 and 1/2 to nearly five minutes.

Narrative:
On Tuesday the day before Wed Oct 5 one of our young witnesses, Obs.B, was delivering his papers on John St. at approximately 5:00 AM. when he reached the last house on the west end street he noticed a group of lights in the field west of the street. He glanced at these and since they seemed somewhere near or in line with where the electric sub station should have been he thought they were new lights placed on it and continued his route.

On Wednesday morning the boys were delivering their papers and usually keeping within sight of each other. This was their mothers wish because of so much crime recently. Obs. B invited his friend to come down to the end of John St. and see the new lights, thinking perhaps they might scare him a little. As they delivered their papers and approached the end of the street it was readily apparent that the lights had moved since the night before and were a little more to the north. The boys sat on their bikes and stared transfixed and half afraid at a dark object with lights some 280 yards out in the field. One said to me "I knew it was a UFO." The other said "It was eerie and I felt like something was there that shouldn't be." (See attached sheet for the boys drawings of what they could see.)

Obs.A heard a faint high-pitched whirring sound from the direction of the object.
It has been suggested that what he heard was Roots Blower Co. a local factory testing a blower. He can forget this because they were not testing at this time. Both of the boys noticed a faint odor which one described as smelling like sulphur. The other boy who has a chemistry set said it smelled like a mixture of sulphur and tannic acid. Our young observers were sure that they next began to hear a sound which in from 10 to 20 seconds by their estimates caused them to flee the scene in fear and at great speed. It was the sound of something walking slowly through the weeds and stubble in the field. Obs. A said "I could hear the sound of breaking weeds and stubble and it sounded like a person walking

Here is the text from the document:

Verifiable Fact No. 1.
    "I have actual photographic proof of the holes impressed in the ground by the object.
They were not created by any natural means that could be discovered. The farmer owning the
field and Mr. Hanson, an agent of his, together testified that he had nothing with
that many lights on it and did not recall moving anything into the field.

Verifiable Fact No. 2.
    The witnesses are the better type of American boy, intelligent and truthful, with good
family backgrounds. There is absolutely no possibility of dishonesty on their part. Of this
I am certain. After a week of off and on investigation, the were constantly restrained to tell
exactly what they saw or heard no more and no less. Their story was checked one against
the other, questions were repeated at different times and indications of unreliability were
looked for.

Verifiable Fact No. 3.
    With thousands of quiet fields to land on why land here? My walk down two times and
remain for an unknown length of time? One would have to be some kind of a dunce not to
know that something interested them greatly in that area. As it turns out, an ideal spot was
the sub-station and its close connection to the State Police post, and its transmitter.
    What an ideal spot from which to observe and study the airlifting power supply system,
police and government communications, and general activity. 180 yards from a 69,000 to
12,000 volt bark of three transformers supplying power to southern and east Connersville,
and a rural area 15 miles south. Two blocks from the State Police Post, 3 tenths of a mile
from the fill, one half mile from the court house, and 9 tenths mile from a 69,000 volt line.

Verifiable Fact No. 4.
    When this sighting is placed in its proper context with four previous sightings we
can easily perceive a definite and disturbing pattern, an indication of great interest in
and success with an unknown of our area - possibly a test of communications.

DEVICES
Sightings 1 and 2 - Two mating sightings which should have been on the National News wire first; namely, or using friends or neighbors of a person owning a citizen band radio
tracked for over an hour - hovering, circling and returning UFO. Then later in the
evening two objects over a 69 radio tower while he was transmitting, knocking him
off the air. In such way he was able to learn more from of our communications that night.

Sightings 3 and 4 - Some mysterious glowing object was very interested in our Federal
Micro Wave Relay Tower. It made two visits in one night. Another object was seen and
so far due to its nest, in the area of a telephone relay tower.

Final conclusion concerning East Connersville sighting:
    With this event we have the critics and disbelievers in a corner from which the only
means of escape is to say the boys must be boy-agers and dug the holes or else dismiss the
entire story from their minds and go back to hiding their heads in the sand.

Obs. A: description and drawing of the object:
The edge of the object was solid and smooth but it didn't reflect light very well. It sat level. He couldn't see the under part. He seen about ten red, green-another color he can't remember-lights. He didn't remember where they were on the object except four shown. The lights pulsated slowly. They were round and about the size of a light bulb. He estimated the object's size as 27 ft. long and 10 ft. high after observing an auto at the same distance in some estimated darkness. It was found that the object must have been a light color or he could not have seen it at all.

Obs. B: a description and drawing of the object:
Seen a dark curved shape. He said it would be the same as if you shut all the lights off in a house. You could still see a dark something. He seen at least 8 red, white, green, clear bright lights. They were a little bigger than outdoor xmas light. At several places in between he could see faint dim lights. They pulsated slowly. Went remember sequence. He estimated distance between the end lights to be 23 feet apart and 6 foot off the ground after observing two fresh lights in the field at the same distance.

The adult witness and the boy estimated the holes to be 8 feet from each other forming an equidistant triangle. Obs. B stepped off the distance. The adult witness said holes to be at least 7 inches in diameter at the top, tapering to around 1 inch at the bottom. This formed a cone shape. The holes were estimated and appears to be in the photographs taken, 7 or 8 inches deep. The adult witness described the holes as cleanly compressed with no dirt on the top edges and not even the weeds on the top edge disturbed. Obs. A said the sides of the holes were fairly smooth and "kinda hard". Obs. B said the sides of the holes felt like dirt that had water poured on it and then dried in the sun.

RELAY TOWER CASE

Page 32, RR, Rushville, Ind. House wife.

Date: Wednesday Oct. 5, 1966 (night previous to the big event.)
Locality: 4 miles NE Rushville
Sky Conditions: clear, no moon, stars out, moderate to light wind.

Narrative:
The kitchen is on the east side of the house from the bedroom, and you can look into the kitchen from the bed in the bedroom. One large kitchen window opens to the east. A Federal Aviation Micro wave Relay Tower is situated about two city blocks SE by NE from the window. This lady lay awake in her bed and was startled to see her kitchen become-all lit up in a steady blue green colored light. It was as light as it would have been had a fluorescent lamp been turned on. The light flooded in her east kitchen window and because of fear she did not leave the bed and go look out the window. Nor did she awaken her husband and he is quite put out about this yet. For nearly 10 minutes by her bedroom clock the light remained there. Then the edge of light began to recede across the kitchen floor, as if something outside were moving away. It took an estimated 20 seconds for the light to go across the kitchen floor and darkness to return. Several hours later around 2:00 AM her daughter who was ill got up to go to the bathroom and Mrs. Christman awoke to again see her kitchen bathed in the light. And again after an approximate 10 minute time period it slowly receded across the floor, faded from the window and darkness returned.

Sat- I rechecked her story again today. I am positive she is telling the truth and has no reason to do otherwise. The radio engineer and I discovered her when we were checking around the relay tower and she told her story spontaneously. I can find no light from any source to explain this. The nearest light is too far away and behind trees. No other farm lights seemed to be awake that night.

Sun- Re-questioned her for third time in presence of USRA men and radio engineer and learned that refrigerator ceased to run while light was present. It had been out of order and was coming on very often. It resumed after the light left.

Conclusion based on facts: A highly luminous aerial object hovered in the vicinity of the Micro wave Relay Tower for an undetermined length of time.

Clark Sighting

Person making sighting: Howard Clark, 720 W. 22nd St. Connersville, Ind., Phone 825 3880
Employed DM on line, Education 4 yrs. Service 4 yrs Navy, age 53.

Time: Fri Oct. 21, 1966 between 8:30 and 9:00 PM.

Locality of observation: same as address.

Total time observation: 6 seconds.

Sky conditions: Partly cloudy, Cumulus clouds, some stars, 1st quarter moon at approx. 
60 degrees south, good visibility, no wind.

Narrative:

Person went out to roll up the windows of his car parked in the driveway next to 
his home. As he opened the door he felt a warm flush of heat such as one would feel from 
a distant furnace or stove. At first he thought his wife must have overheated the car motor. 
But the heat seemed to be on his face so he looked up. There in the sky hovering silent 
and perfectly motionless was sharply outlined dark oval shaped object. An area estimated 
at 50 feet around the object was moderately illuminated. It was in the S by NS at approx. 
45 degrees elevation. After strange object was the size of an orange held at arm's length or 
as described it "big as a tub". Beneath it a light of seemingly light bulb size was 
glowed with a rusty yellow color. From what seemed the rear of the thing there was 
sticking out a short rod or antenna. After hovering about 5 seconds it suddenly accelerated 
and within a second and a snap of the fingers it disappeared. During this departure toward 
the NW at a 45 degree angle a barked curve a glimpse was caught of what seemed to be 
a short swept back fin or other projection on each side of the object. The witness said 
it reminded him of a devilfish in shape and things sticking out. It left behind a flat 
seemingly 5 foot wide brownish dust like trail. The witness felt the warm flush of heat 
no longer. He went into his home and told his wife and children. They thought he was joking 
and laughed at him. The finally came to realize he was not joking. In bed that night he 
lay debating with himself. "Did I real see something or didn't I?? The thing seemed too 
incredible and the time too short. He was reluctant to see me since he fears the reaction 
of his fellow employees at work.

Important note: An AVCO (Aviation Corp.) top secret explosives test facility is located 
approx. 1/2 mile SE of the sighting location. A telephone micro ray tower is located 
approx. 1/4 mile NW of the sighting location.

Locality of sighting: On State Road 121 9 miles south of Connersville, Ind.

Sky conditions: Clear, starry, no moon, slight breeze, cool evening.

Total time seen: 10 or 20 seconds at most.

Narrative:
Witness who has a citizen band radio in his car was driving home from work south bound on highway. As he neared near bridge on highway he observed rapidly approaching from the south at about 300 or 400 feet and an estimated 1/4 mile away, a bright white light of what he thought must be an airplane maybe going to try to land. Object swooped over the top of a large house on a hill south of the bridge and dived at the bridge at faster than jet speed. And seemed to come at him. Down the highway. Witness said he felt very insecure, admits to fear and a desire to find a way to retreat. He swerved his car and jumped on the brakes. The object was described as being round, much larger than an orange hole at arm's length. It had a bright white area wider like glow that rivaled the sun in brightness. It was smooth edged, left no trail. The object glowed from all angles.

The object suddenly made a right angle turn to the left and whizzed down the creek bed so low the observer could see it rush through the trees as it went east and was quickly lost from sight. At no more than an estimated 10 seconds later another object this one white lights on it followed exactly same route. This had had the same maneuvers and speed as the first. The witness sat in stunned bewilderment.

As Rey Cox had a chance the object he was on the air transmitting on his CB radio.

And then a move took place. All he was able to say was "Follow I may need help it----" and the strange light loomed near. His radio, both transmitter and receiver were a blocked by a transformer like hum. This is this persons second meeting with an unidentified flying object. He firmly believes in them.

Note: The fact that strange flying objects had been seen in that area.--

The fact that he was cut off in mid sentence.--

The fact that on his return to the air he was excited to say the less.--

Based all facts are all verified by those listening to him on the CB radio.

Locality of Sight: "Fricks 1st Vicinity in Payette and Rush Counties in Southeast Central
Indiana.

Sky Conditions: Clear, stars out, no moon, cool night sweaters needed.

Total time sighting: Over 1 and 1/2 hour.

Narrative:
Jack Lewis and wife and children were across east on the Columbus road six miles
southwest of Connersville, his wife noticed an... and thought to see air space with red,
green, and white lights going out very low. to some was weird. Suddenly the object
stopped instantly and hovered to no more than constant height over a field. Jack turned his
car (facing the way across the road) and the wife began photographing it on the road. An
analysis would weigh white light for approximately 15 minutes. Jack and his wife were on
the CB radio mutually hearing everyone who saw. Suddenly after the object became
much brighter it too off in... fast position(the light) at a rapid speed and a green and red
light could be seen on a CB radio and a little over in the white light. Witnesses drove
west again to Fries and no panics observed in the yard looking for the object.

The light now came back from the south and hovered very low over a wood at estimated
250' was south. It hovered for another 10 or 15 minutes. This time the object went completely
lately just than five off a rapid rise into the western sky. Then it stopped and hovered
again for a while. Then it turned a bright white to a spot off west. Its speed was amazing-
faster than a jet. It seemed to hang over part of Rush County and CB owners over there
could be heard saying "I see it, I see it." Then a sparkling white light it ran and
and so on to fly north over Connersville. It seemed to stop in the N by NE and began to
slowly change from red to white to green etc. A CB owner who is from Ohio was supposed to
have made a tape recording of 2 hrs in excitement. News was also supposed to have called a
CB owner in Dayton (Ohio) who called "Wright-Paterson AFB" about some planes. No tape has been
produced and it is seems to be a lie. Another tale has it Wright-Patt AFB had blips on their
radar in this area. Anyway it is true that two prop planes did arrive over here and flew
11 over the area. The object in the N by NE has recessed and seemed starlike. The lanes
never did a rate it. Finally it looked like every other star and was lost in time.

It sounded like a two motored aircr ft. Didn't think it was a passenger plane. One man seen a light due east over Abbington, at ap rosin their 30 degrees elevation. It was much larger than a star when first seen. It had a bright white color with an orange tint. The light seemed to be moving due west toward them. It would more than seem to stop, then move again, and steadily got larger. On the third wide circle the plane went toward the light and when it got close the planes motors cut out 86r a second. The plane veered away and the object shot up in the sky some distance then came back lower. The plane must have left the area.

He didn't watch the plane as he was too busy watching the light. Light now large as a grapefruit held at arms length, round, fuzzy edged. It seemed very weird and few clothed his stomach. One man wanted to shine his flashlight at the object but the others didn't want him to. Then the object at about 30 degrees a elevation the person flashed his light up at the object. Object instantly took off and distance looked a small ball like fire coal and its pre red in 4 sec do.

When he got home he took 3 sedaring so he could sleep good because he had to get up early for work. Stood by wife who lay in bed and continued nervous wells he gets when nervous and told wife of h rroving incident.

Locality of sighting: 5 miles NE of Brownsville, Ind. near old sawmill woods.

Sky conditions: clear, starry, cold

Narrative:

Out coon hunting with his friends. They had been out about three hours. A plane started circling slowly rd seemed about 1,000 feet up. He noticed an extra bright star in the east. It was the brightest star he had ever seen. The star got larger and seemed to be coming toward them. Sometimes sat still in mid air and had a yellow colored glow. As this light got about half way to them the circling plane flew to the right of it. He heard the plane's motors overhead by a tall walnut tree. Then the size of the flashlight was flashed at it. The thing took off "most instantly" it seemed. In two seconds it got dimmer, turned into a small finger tip and disappeared. It left at about a 45 degree angle toward the west.

The person who shined the light up to the object said he did so because he wanted to communicate with that.

Additional information: Wildlife said he kept talking excitedly about what had happened to them on their coon hunting trip and was still talking about it as they lay in bed after midnight. She finally said "I believe you, please shut up so we can get some sleep."!

Date of sighting: Nov 14, 1966 (Mon) at around 1:30CFM

Locality of sighting: 5 miles NE of Brownsville near the old sawmill woods.

Sky conditions: clear starry cold.

Total time seen: 5 to 10 minutes

Narrative:
Out coon hunting with friends. He got irked at an airplane flying in circles overhead which drowned out the sound of their distant hounds tracking a coon. One man notice a very bright star like object growing larger and coming their way in the dist nea. It was a bright white light with an orange cast. It came very slowly and sometimes may have stopped.

Object grew much closer and the circling plane now flew near the object. He heard planes motors rise. Thought he heard them miss two times out only sure of one occasion know where plane went to but thought he heard it leaving. Light no ray overhead now. Everyone afraid especially two of the men. One said "I don't like this I think I'll get out of here."

He said he held on to this man(his brother in law) shirt with one hand to keep him from running. Said he seen another man put his hand on the pistol on his belt. (Ready for quick draw, he.) When object nearly overhead he said it was a little larger than a full moon.

He flashed his 5 cell flashlight up at the object. He never did answer my question of why he did so. The object took off awful fast and was out of sight almost middle of the stars in by his estimate 3 seconds. On the way home he said one of the men shook badly in the warm car but blamed it on the cold night.

Background Information: His man's wife said he was pale and excited when he got home. This man flashed his light on the object over the objections of his friends. After interviewing all four personalities I would have picked him out as the one to do this even if he had not told me. He seemed to be a mild sort of "smart aleck" type. I interviewed him last and put less reliance on him than several of the others.

Person making sighting: Robert Van Sickie, 419 E. 11th St. Rushville, Ind. Age 43,
Employed- Police Captain Rushville Force, Education - High School, Police Schools,
Military service- 5 years Army, Tech. Sergeant.

Date of observation: Monday Oct 10, 1966 - he thought it was around 2 or 3 AM.
Locality: near Rushville, North of Rushville on old State Road 3 near covered bridge.
Sky conditions: very clear sky full of brilliant stars, temperature - cool 55 or less,
Crescent moon at approx. 30 degrees elevation.

Total time seen: 10 to 15 minutes.

Narrative:

Mr. Grocox came into station very excited and told him about 5 strange objects in
the sky. He followed Grocox back out to the site. Watched two objects in the sky. One
at approximately 70 degrees elevation due east and the other 33 by SE same elevation.
Objects changed brightness occasionally. The one in the east moved side to side a little.
Never did see the one in the SE by SE move. Both approximately size of pea held at arms
length. The objects were triangle or cone shaped to him. The blunt end in front was a
bright white, and the edges of the entire object had a white glow but not as bright so
the front. And of the object. The middle of the crankshaft back part seemed less bright
than elsewhere. His drawing is reproduced below.

Note: Perhaps the difference in size as seen by different observers at different times
was due to the objects seemed as moving farther away or getting closer. I did not manage
to talk to this observer until about 4 weeks after the event and he seems to have forgotten
some of the details or didn't care to remembered. He kept cautioning me not to let his
name be known, my name, etc. Also said he didn't want to know who the woman was in the
car parked there. Maybe it was someone else's wife and he didn't want to see anything and
get mixed up in a divorce case.

He said " Something was up there. I don't know what?" He did not see what you would
call a tail on the object.

Rushville, Ind. age 25, Th                                     Maintenance Man
Carthage Container Corp. Education -High School

Date of sighting: Mon Oct. 10, 1966 at approx. 4:COAY
Locality of sighting: One mile north of Rushville on old state road 3.

Sky conditions: Clear, very good visibility, no wind, moon crescent last quarter at
approximately 30 degrees in eastern sky.

Total time seen: 20 to 30 minutes.

Narratives:
Witness called in early early on maintenance job at factory. ( See explanations below. )
Noticed bright object in sky at approx 70 degrees north. Watched thru windshield of car
and from outside as cluster of five objects moved across the sky at speed slower than a
plane. Witness said objects were at 1,000 or 1,500 feet altitude going due east.
Witness now apologized for what he was next told to say. He said the objects were
triangular with rounded corners. Then further stated that all except the small one like
one had a thin slightly curved projection on the rear about 1/4 their body length.
Which he called a "light". Witness held up his hands in a full gesture and said: "That
is what I saw. I don't know what it was." Witness further stated that while driving
I went my ways kept secret. I have been bugged enough and ready. Witness further stated
that as they passed over the largest one appeared the size of an orange length.
And the rest just one a similar size. Witness being various shapes in between. They all
glowed with a bright white glow at the edges, inside, and also the "tail". Witness now
again says 3 though he nearly believed himself said they jumped up and down in the
sky in very quick jerks. Witness did not get police called. ( Just like
follow the leader. ) Their tells always remained the same curve and length during the
maneuvers. The next observer jumped into his car and made this 3 or 4 minute trip into
the city to get police witness. Cop. Van Sickle followed him back out to the scene.
Only three objects were now observed in the eastern sky at about 45 degrees elevation.
The largest one approximately one half the size of a full moon, the other less than half
as large and the rest in a slightly smaller. No tails could be seen on the two smaller
objects. Their maneuvers were fantastic. The big one are always moved first than the others
followed. They jumped up and down. And in turns one bright than faded out
than came a brighter one. The original glow. However on several occasions the others did
not jump after the big one did, nor did they follow the maneuver in which the big one
last only disappeared. Witness further stated in part of the sky approx
20 degrees distant. They gradually got smaller and disappeared at nearly the same altitude.
Bolo is a drawing of the three objects in the white's draw them.
Note: Witness was interviewed via home of some friends with father present, and said he
was called in on maintenance job. His wife had been deceased for about 4 months. The police
officers notified about the fourth witness a woman being in the car. So the sight of these
objects in a way was sad him to have a want and got police witnesses even though doing so
was mutually and detrimental to him personally.

RUSH COUNTY SIGHTING

Cris Miller, age 16, Little Charm Motel, Rt 3, Rushville, Ind. phone 932-9015, Fredonia, Rt.

Date: Thur. Oct 6, 1966 at 7:15 PM (Soon time on motel clock that was in general direction)
of object was behind which object traveled in journey.
Locally: seen from Little Charm Motel just north of city limits on state road 3.

Total time observation: 15 minutes. 5 minutes in which object seemed to hover in spot.
10 minutes passing.

Sky conditions: Clear crisp night, little light in east where sun had set, some stars, 
slight wind from west.

Narrative:
First noticed object 20 degrees elevation due east, a dingy yellow light brighter in
center. Grew brighter than the moon and about half the size of the moon. Once seemed to
fade and rise in the air. Was very very slow in flight. Seemed to go north then turn west.

Two very bright lights like auto headlights became visible light from object shown on
field across state road 3 from motel and grass could be seen clearly. A herd of cattle in
the field were very disturbed and were hard mooing and milling about. It is believed they
ran to a distant corner. At this time the two lights were so bright they bothered the
viewers eyes momentarily. The object seemed to have veered north of the motel and was not
flying level but in a sort of tilt. As the object passed overhead to the north at about
60 or 70 degrees elevation, the two white lights disappeared and a dark solid oval shaped
object became visible. Its size was approximately that of a silver dollar held at arms
length. Bright red lights were visible at intervals all around the objects outer edge.

These lights pulsated in sequence. A circle of lights was not seen but a horseshoe shape
of lights, including some on the upper side of the tilted object were not visible to him.

On top of the object there appeared to be a large dome which contained or reflected a
bluish white light. No sound was heard and this puzzled the viewer. (The motel phone
rang as he was taking care of the motel for his absent father he had to answer the
call. It was found that in several cases the source was not heard until the object passed
beyond the observer. This may be why he did not hear any sound. All other witnesses who
were near enough did.) When he returned the object was gone. He call the Rushville Police.
They did not arrive.

GROUND SIGHTING

Person making sighting: 
Jda Clark, SCI 1/2 R. Perkins, Nashville, Ind. Age 32, Patrolman on Nashville Police Force, 
Education: 12 yrs.

Date: Mon Oct. 10, 1966 at Approx. 4:00 AM (not too sure of time)
Location of sighting: One mile ribbon of Nashville on country road near Covered Bridge.
Sky Conditions: Very clear right, good visibility.
Total time so in; Approximately 10 minutes.

Narrative:
Police Captain Van Sickle came in from area north of the city where he had been 
watching the strange objects in the sky. He told me to go out there and take a look and 
see what I thought. There were three objects in the sky. The largest was half the size of 
a full moon and the other two were smaller, with one being one third that size and the 
other a glow one tenth. The largest one appeared thus to me: (exact copy of his drawing is 
reproduced below). No spotlight was not drawing the exact edge, but some of glow also. 
They were bright white luminously to a white edges and on the left of the larger one. 
He's out on the large city road, he didn't remember exactly. During the day, he did not see 
it till in the afternoon. He said they did seem to be trying a shape with a slightly 
curved tail. During movement the tail always remained in the same position. The only 
maneuvers he remembered was that they moved across the sky and went to nearly overhead and 
then back to their original position. The three witnesses (whom an the car included) 
watched the three objects gradually get smaller and fade from sight.

Patrolman Clark said "I don't know what they were, but I saw something. I have 
found that Police Officers as a rule are afraid of the skeptical public as anyone else. They would 
rather not be quoted or associated with these events. Those that I seen in Bucks county 
seemed to be poor reluctant observers.

Other witness, wife Elsie P. seen for 2 or 3 minutes.

Narrative:
Just arrived home happened to look up and seen stationary light 40 degrees at elevation 
in the S NE. It was a sharp bright white light that shown like a diamond. It seemed almost 
as bright as the sun. It appeared about half the size of the moon and was not round out 
egg shaped, sometimes seemed to pulsate and reduce illumination strength. Soon became two 
bright lights as moved toward N-SW. Now viewed through trees at closest point, one 
observer didn't care to go out in open. Said he felt safer behind trees. Object now 75 
by 5 and guessed it was 100 feet high. At about 70 degrees elevation it seemed to be going 
about 20 or 25 miles per hour. It was going so slow he thought it should fall out of the 
sky. It was a solid dark oval shape sharp and clear in the night air. At least 10 red 
lights about the size of a spot light in relation to the object were visible even spread 
around the outside edge of the object. These twinkled in sequence, a little over 
1 second in time for each twinkle. He heard a droning muffled sound. Hurried in and got 
wife. Object disappeared in S.W. direction. He went in and tried to call sheriff out that 
busy. Thought all this was "someone" before now is not so sure.

All seen object between 7:00 and 7:30 for from 10 to 15 minutes.

Witnesses viewed object from Due East ,NE, Due W, directions around Rushville, and watched
it fade in the SW or W.

It arrived from the NE or Due E and all agreed it was an unusually bright light.

All could see it become two bright lights except some persons in Carthage district.

All seen some flickering or blinking red lights.

All agreed it traveled very slow. Floated, thought it was standing still etc.

Its sound was given many descriptions such as; Electric mixer, Helicopter, humming sound,
farm combine two motored aircraft, muffled car motor etc.

To the three farmers and son on RR7 who were working in field, the object seemed to rise
into view from over a hill to their east. and at one time drop back and fade, then come
on as two bright headlights like a car in the sky. A humming sound was heard after object
passed overhead. One farmer thought he seen a hood around a red light on the front. A rear
red light (They seen wht appeared to be just three lights on it.) periodically blinked.

The mortician and wife reported the same phenomenon. It is very interesting to note that the
farmers (east of Carthage) east of Rushville saw two red lights when she saw the object west of Rushville. But in between we have two
reliable reports of a circle of red blinking lights, and Those or outer rim and not on
front to end back, with only the rear or blinking. What goes on here???

RUSH COUNTY SIGHTING

Persons making sighting:
Delmonte Wagner, age 28, Box 105, Arlington, Ind. Phone 863-9695, employed - 
Container Corp. Carthage, Occupation Millwright, Education High School, Service 
2 years army.

Donna Wagner, age 26, wife, employed Container Corp. Education High School.

Date of sighting: Thursday Oct. 6, 1966 at 7:15 Pm.
Duration of sighting: 10 to 15 minutes.
Sky conditions: Clear, little light in west.

Narrative:
Wagners in car going north out of Arlington. The very bright light approached from 
the east, was seen to bob up and down rapidly over some trees. Bright white light turned 
north then back to a westerly direction. Wagners turned east on country road and car 
and light approached each other. As light approached it became so bright that one could 
not look at it directly. Observers had stopped their car. Some 200 yards east on 
north side of the road at approximately 80 degrees elevation object stopped in mid 
air. Observer guessed height at 200 ft? The powerful white light went out and nothing 
but blackness could be seen for 10 or 15 seconds. But a sound could be heard. He said 
sounded like a Wag Wag Machine. She said it was a rough roaring or rumbling sound.
Observers were puzzled as to what it could be. More positive it was not a helicopter. 
Said it didn't sound like one or act like one. Then one red light came on in the air. 
The light was steady for 10 or 15 seconds then started to blink as the object began to 
move toward the west. When asked whether the red light swung up or back or whether 
the pitch of the sound did not increase, they said it did not. When directly 30 degrees 
north from the Wagners the object again stopped in mid air approximately 10 seconds 
than went into reverse and moved back down the road as east. The observers followed 
in their car and object suddenly stopped in mid air again. The observers drove their 
car until they were due south of the object and it at 80 degrees elevation, then got 
out of their car and looked up at the red light. Try as they may they could not see 
any shape or form behind it. Suddenly accelerating without increase in sound level 
the object sped off toward the west. The husband hurriedly turned his car around at the 
next cross roads and raced after the object hitting 80 mph. The object with the red light 
now rapidly blinking disappeared from sight within 10 seconds by the Wagners estimate.

Narrative.
Driving east down hill on w 12th. St. They noticed in the S NE at about 45 degrees elevation a brilliant orange glow from an object shaped like a nose cone of a missile on its side. It seemed to be stationary, was twinkly and glittery, and had sparkling fuzzy edge. Its size was less than a dime held at arms length. She stopped the car and they watched as long as possible before the boys 7:00 meeting downtown.
As she drove on trees obscured her view occasionally. Object was in the north at approximately 70 degrees elevation. To be seen now were two big clear balls like the headlights of a car, on nothing like the lights of a plane. They heard no sound. She lost sight of it as to trees downtown.

by a light point area already above the cloud. All five traveled but a very short distance and disappeared in the haze. The haze had began to break up and many dark places began to be seen by the time the police arrived. The 5 sugar now began to move at about pipes one fifth signal on an upward flight path toward the explosion site. When it almost reached the spot where the glow first appeared it just disappeared. At this point it was the size of a large star. At 9:15 the sky was almost clear again except for a few streaks of haze.

No other witnesses have been forthcoming as yet to this event.

Notes: When I went to question her about this sighting, I placed before her a picture of what she had seen. It is on page 6 of the September APRO bulletin. She was quite surprised to say that is it. This also seemed to reassure her that I did understand and believe her fantastic sighting and she went on to relate another incident she was not going to mention because she felt it was "all too much," and I might not believe her.

This incident was the 5 object launching? or what looked like one. The witness said the jet had little wing fire just like the picture which made her think it was a jet with a trail. She said its size was such that one held her pencil at arm's length the center covered the jet part except for the glow in the L. Due to a previous experience and my question, the witness was out with pencil and paper and measured with her pencil or fingers, timed and recorded everything that she could. I would almost hesitate classify her as excitable observer. She was ready this time.

BRENDA BUTTS SIGHTING

Persons making sighting: Brenda Butts, 227 E. 2nd. St. Nashville, Ind. Age 20, Employed International Furniture Co. Nashville, Education AC grade.

Date of sighting: Sat. Oct. 29, 1966 starting at 6:35 PM

Location of sighting: seen from above address in sky to S by SE, SE, and S by E.

Sky conditions: Clear, bright stars, full-moonlight approx. 15 degrees elevation in east, temperature 49 degrees, no wind.

Total time seen: Thereof watched approx. one hour and 15 minutes.

Other witnesses: Her mother--Mary Glenn age 60 ( she seen the red glow and red and white clouds).
Her brothers - David Glen, age 12, Mark Glen age 11, and neighbor boys, Russell Jenks, and Jack Fudge. They all saw many of the things Brenda saw.

Narrative:

Brenda was called outside by her two brothers to see a "Flying Saucer". She stood in the back yard with her brothers and their friends and scanned point of light similar then a large star move slowly then star at approximately 30 degrees elevation in the S by SE sky. It would alternate colors colors red or white and frequently disappear for a second. She compared the object with another large star nearby and its color changes were more pronounced. This object remained in this position for approx. an hour and 15 minutes.

At about 7:15 there appeared suddenly in the SE sky at approx. 32 degrees elevation and some 15 degrees east of the "saucer" object an object she called "Jet" because that is what she at first thought it was. This jet was very bright and shiny and it had a tail of light about 10 times as long as basically which remained constant length. Its color and shape never changed as it moved cross the sky at faster than jet speed in an upward flight with a disappear in approx. 40 degrees elevation in the S by SE in an estimated 5 seconds. No one was looking directly toward the saucer before the jet appeared so it is not known from where it originated. Attention had been attracted to a simultaneous happening in the S by SE some 20 degrees from the moon, and to the same elevation.

The sky had a terrific red glow with a white haze spreading around it very fast. The dull red seemed to be a curved layer and so did the white. The white was brighter than a cloud but not as bright as a light. The red began to fade as the white kept spreading, and turning into a haze. The red faded about three times faster than the white. The witness ran into the house and had her mother come out. The mother had son call police. The haze kept spreading to darken the moon somewhat and cover the stars in the area. In the midst of the thicker haze in the spot where the witness had first seen the explosion? there was now noticed a somewhat large dark gray band or layer of cloud. The band was approx. 1/16 the width of a full moon and seemed longer than a full moon with the ends lost in the haze. The witness was very uncertain about these observations. Shooting up out of this cloud? came two pairs of light points about the size of a regular star. All arose at the same time and were joined

REMY SIGHTING

Persons making sighting: Larel Ramy RR 3 Rushville, Ind. USA age 45, Housewife, Education-8 yrs.
Also Harry Ramy, age 45, Employed -International Furniture, Education 12 yrs.,
Service- 3 yrs. Army.
Daughter - Christine Lore , age 22, Housewife, Education-12 yrs.

Date of Observation: Oct. 12, 1966, (WED.) at approx. 8:00 PM

Location of Observation: 6 miles N by NE of Rushville near Clings. (Federal Relay Tower approx. 5 miles SE of here.)

Sky conditions: Clear starry sky , no moon , no wind, cool night.

Total time seen: she was uncertain, over 5 minutes?

Narrative:
Mr. Remy came in from outside and said " Well come outside and have a look at one of those airplanes that some people mistake for one of those flying saucers. " ( Mrs Ramy said he always laughed at the whole idea of such things.) So all three persons went outside with him to watch the airplane. The airplane was now a perfectly round object , a glowing red color, 3/4 the size of a full moon. It had stopped still and was hovering low near the tree tops due south of them.The husband now changed his mind and decided it was really the red light of the Micro Ray Tower. His wife pointed out to him the tower light over to the southeast. Suddenly the object made a leap thru the air and then stopped instantly.

The length of the jump thru the sky was estimated as 10 full moons in length. This jump took place at such a speed that it was almost too fast for the eye to see. The object now remained stationary for some time then suddenly made another leap of the same distance and speed and stopped instantly. It was now in a more southeasterly direction. After a short pause it began to move east at slower than jet plane speed and seemed to curve around to a northeasterly heading. As it came up to pass them on the east it appeared no longer as a large red object but an object with a red white and a blue green light on it. These lights seemed to move around the object in a horizontal plane as if the object were revolving at just under a speed that would not blur the lights. A dim gray outline could be seen at one time. It seemed to be egg shaped. Mrs. Ramy said she heard a frying sound. An aircraft passed high overhead going west. As the object moved further north it became red and round again and growing dimmer faded from sight.

Notes: Fearless to say the father skeptic was disturbed when the object jumped thru his sky. His wife said he became quite excited. (His wife (Mrs. Raines) said he could get a good look at it.) wanted to call the sheriff, but the husband cautioned her not too because people would think them "silly".

flight with no disappear to the east. It moved at about prop aircraft speed. Officer of
the opinion that it was an airplane.

Note: Officer was not interested enough or did not want to be seen getting out of the
patrol car and watching with other persons. He just sat in car at cure. He also told me
about some fellow who called about seeing this glowing light near a transformer south of
the city. He said he was of the opinion that it was a light near the transformer that fog
made glow. Also told me he former told him that thing that flew over north of the city
Oct. 6 was an airplane. (At first the police had said it was a satellite.)
As compared to Brenda who was out researching and writing down everything she could,
I would call this fellow a very poor observer.

It was round, a bright red and dimmed or pulsated slow as fast or an ordinary heart beat. It hovered about 3 minutes then suddenly darted to the west and stopped. Then from its SE position it began moving east and curved around us to thennorth at about pillar cub plane speed. As it passed to the east of us the light changed to red, green, and white light and looked as if they were revolving around. The object became more oval shaped. An aircraft going west passed it high overhead. As it continued north it went all red again. I soon faded from sight.

1st. SOUTHWEST OF CRAGE SIGHTING

Rushville, Ind. Age 20, employee - International Furniture Co.
Rushville, Ind.
Witness not contacted as yet.

Date of sighting: Last week in April, 9 time uncertain - after 7:00 P.M.
Location of sighting: From southeast of Crage to near Goudy in southern Rush County.
Sky conditions: clear night.
Total time spent: Incident lasted over an hour.

Note: The object observed appeared as one brilliant flash or three brilliant flashes.
Approximately one second in time separated the flashes when it was a multiple flash.
Seen on the horizon of the first flash was a glowing fiery reddish orange sphere surrounded by
a zone of white light approximately 1/3 larger still. The center globe seemed about
the size of a volleyball but the witness was not at all certain of the size or distance.
No shape of form could ever be seen just the brilliant globe.

"The witnesses engaged in a game with this strip this way by turning as often as they
could on country roads in the direction of the last flash, they traveled some 22 miles
over country roads at the request of 3 in a fore or less big route on the map.
The first several times the flash was seen it was thought to be a filling station light
at a distance down the road. But when they arrived at the filling station they found this
light broken, not working.

On another light it shined an even different locations during the "game".
On one occasion it flashed very low to the ground so simply no more than 3 or 4 feet.
This was in the front yard of a residence. It illuminated the sky, yard, house, trees etc.
The interested observers planned to drive hurriedly to the spot but before he could even
begin to reach same and turn back on his lights, when he had turned off to see what would
happen, the globe had flashed up in some distance near a field. In a split second either
it or another like it had flashed some distance away.

Another thing noticed was that on one occasion when the globe flashed to be seen
beside it and 2/3 its size was another globe. The white layers touched but not the reddish
orange centers. Had another thing joined it or had it grown or sailed out to become two?
