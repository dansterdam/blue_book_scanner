Transcribed text from the document:

Observer noted object in the west southwest at shortly after night. Object appeared to be moving very slowly. Observer watched object for several minutes and object being still visible. Observer went back outside about 0100, 6 Oct 66 to look for object. 

At this time object had moved slightly to the right and downward. Object had moved about 6 inches from original position. White was the predominant color observed. At 0300 observer again tried to locate the object but at this time object had disappeared.

Observer was questioned about sighting. She thought it might have been a satellite. She had never seen a satellite previously. Movement puzzled her and then when she went back outside at 0300 the object disappeared she became concerned. She wasn't reporting an UFO just an unusual light.

CONCLUSION
Witness was more than likely observing the star Altair. At 0015 EST Altair was on an azimuth of 268 degrees and at an elevation of 15 degrees. At 0100 EST Altair was at an azimuth of 275° and at elevation of 8° at 0300 Altair would not have been visible to the observer because it set at approximately 0200 EST. Altair being bluish - white star appears to be what the observer witnessed.

Donna Gosser, 26 Williams, Rushville, Ind. Age 16, 5th grade.
Four High school boys from New Castle who observed the object with Eric Miller returning to Rushville and found NO small clog for the object.
Dirk Pugh, Age 10, Douglas Gosser Age 9, Tommey Gosser Age 7. These objects for about 15 seconds when it was about one city block away.
Time of Observations: Monday Aug. 1, 1966, 7:30 to 8:00 P.M. Sun set, no stars, dusk.
Locations: South side of Rushville Ind. Near State Road 52 at a suburb.
Sky Conditions: Partly cloudy, to the west and north the clouds were.
Narrative: Donna Gosser, just happen to look up from the road where she was Gosser and saw the object almost directly overhead filling a space about half a minute more than 1/3 of the way across the sky. She said it looked triangular brass in color showing no lights and Douglas Gosser who were down the road on their bicycles said the object was large, bright, more than the size of a large bus and hovered motionless. She said it stood still but rocked slightly, little in the air. As she watched, the object slowly changed in color from the metallic shine with a faint glow on top, to a dull gray metallic shine and seemed to revolve, slowly tilted over higher to J 52 and in no more than two seconds seemed to start a instant drop about one block south over a houseand continue on a straight course until it went out of sight.

The text in the document is as follows:

"was elliptical in shape, a little smaller than the moon, a radish reddish thing. He thought it seemed to move toward then receded from the observer. Stars which were turned on was a dim object moved down. This was not verified but suddenly became brighter. Object diminished in size to a little round gray dim light and went out. Its time to accomplish this was estimated at 3 or 4 seconds. Son took the State police fort about 2 miles distant and reported the incident that let the city police handle it. City police finally drove down and later and officers said "'This may call for something." After, he saw a figure over his house. Hell, I dont believe things."

Analysis:
An average sighting.
It is possible son is first kin about object getting to car and stove later.
Bell-like lighting - not up yet.
Still lightning - not in that size, just motion or movement.
Search light on clouds - None in area, would not be fired or range or be.
Stellar reflection or halo thru clouds - object too bright and wrong color to be reflection of city colored light on clouds. Lower person who Hallucinaton - These were all good level-headed sound of mind persons.
Conclusion: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON.

Connersville Sighting

Persons who made observation:
Mr. Wm. V. Murphy, MRS, Connersville, Ind. Age 52, Electrical Maintenance Superintendent, Stanley Murray, Mrs, Connersville, Ind. Age 26, Part time Industrial Supervisor.
Miss Linda Currie, Columbus, Ind. Age 19, University student. ( not a witness)

Time: Monday, Aug. 8, 1966, at 12:20 AM.
Locality: 2 miles SE of the Triangle, a suburb SE of Connersville, Ind. 
Object in view: Slowly moving, originally approached 8 minutes, others approx. 7 or 8 stars seen occasionally.
Sky conditions: Partial low cumulus cloud cover, average darkness visibility of stars seen occasionally, no wind.

Narrative:
Signally pulled into drive of isolated farm house. He noticed a light in the sky 5-35 at 10 or 15 degrees elevation. He gave it no more than a momentary glance and went into the house. As he had forgotten his books so had to return to the car. Re approached the car from the door through which he had entered. It dimmed when he opened the car door and the dome light came on. He brightened when he shut the car door. I pointed out that perhaps the light dimmed when he opened the door and brightened when he shut it, as though the clouding partially covering it that way. He didn't think so, but was not as certain about cloud interference. Now convinced it was no ordinary star, he rushed back into the house where his son-in-law and daughter were to look at the object. Excitedly he called out "You don't get excited, I keep the lights out and you come out to the back kitchen door to watch the thing, but don't go to the bottom of the drive". The son-in-law girl friend Linda was afraid to leave the house for fear of the strange object. The son-in-law said "Linda you are just chicken hearted, this thing is not going to hurt you", but she still would not go out in dread daylight.

Some clouds always around or under the object as it difficult to figure exactly what it was.  To the father the object appeared illuminated (foothill or seg?) bright as a full moon, a fiery reddish orange color or like an arc light picture briefly on the left hand side once. The object seemed to origin from nothing (possible) in clue weather this bright orange in color, so used to pulsate and just sat there in the sky.

"We were out in the back that afternoon, I was sitting pondering out having someone come and see what I had saw, cause I thought I'd never have the chance to see it again. I showed my wife and she said it didn't look right to her, it just seemed awfully strange and unnatural, and unusual in size and shape. The head noise was very low volume but strang(e) sounded like a rumble or roar. I got to wondering if it might be a sonic boom from the missiles at Fort Monmouth, but it seemed too low for that. We saw it for only a few seconds, but I think we both realized at the time that it was not a conventional aircraft of any kind that we had seen before. Actually, I had seen jets taking off and coming in from McGuire AFB many times, and this definitely was not like the jets I had seen.

"A light appeared in the sky suspended in one place, no sound, after that first incident + since, I was hoping to see it again sometime, but have not. Actually we both saw this thing, and I was really wondering what it was or could be."

Every time I think about it I get goose pimples, it was that strange a sight. Especially when a steady red light appeared at the underneath as it passed overhead.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Dear Sirs,

On Monday, October 10, 1966 there occurred a most unusual sighting of an unidentified flying object near Hazlet, New Jersey. The object was first observed at approximately 7:30 PM as I was driving along the Garden State Parkway and very shortly after just under the influence of Pegasus and a very bright star. At first I thought it was merely a reflection of some type of aircraft on the south east horizon, but as I continued to observe the object, it became quite apparent that it was not any known type of aircraft. It hovered for a few minutes and then commenced to move in a northerly direction. The movement of the object was from south east to north west. The movement was slow and steady and the object appeared to be about the size of a small airplane. As the object continued on its course, there seemed to be no sound or any apparent means of propulsion, and there was no blinking of lights as on a conventional aircraft. At the time I saw the object, there was a slight haze in the atmosphere and visibility was not too good. However, I was able to observe the object clearly and distinctly. From the time I first observed the object until it disappeared from view, it took approximately 3 to 5 minutes. They gave off no light, but any apparent illumination, and I have never seen anything like this object before.

Sincerely,
[Signature]"

Personnel interview with Neil Gallmore of Bowersville, Ohio

The alleged UFO has landed between route 73 and 128 for three straight nights and hovered over the ground for a fourth night. On the fourth night the object hovered about 1000 feet off the ground.

The object was making a beeping sound at this time. As the boys approached the object they shined a flashlight at the object. All of a sudden the object shined a light back at the boys.

The object was banana shaped and red in color. There were lights on the landing gear. Also visible were red, green, and white lights. On all four the object was visible from 2130 to 2300 hours. The sheriff and other men were keeping the crowd away from the object. Mr. Gallmore never saw the object at close range while it was making its move towards the boys.

Also at the scene of the sighting there was grass smashed down but there were no burnt marks. Mr. Gallmore said that the landing mark should be reported even though it was a week later. He called Clinton County APS on Saturday and told them they would contact the APS about the sighting.

18 Oct. 66

Contact was made with Major Wilson Clinton County APS, Ohio regarding the observation of UFOs over the Hillsboro area. Major Wilson stated that several civilians had called and asked if the base knew of the sighting. The actual observers did not report the observation to the Air Force. Major Wilson said that from time to time the Army has maneuvers in the area. He said that if could be possible that the people involved could have seen a chopper landing. He did not know of any definite information that it was a UFO sighting.

I thought at might be a rocket but it was not. I watched the one I have seen go up while I attended military training. However, this was definitely not the same type. I continued watching because the movement was slow and me very fast like the big one I have seen before. I also thought it might be a satellite but my friend told me they don't move that fast from south to north. 

The object is I have seen well sometime. They are the brightest stars I have seen. The sky was completely clear during the entire sighting and the temperature was on the low 60s.

I would like to say very much if you could tell me what it was. I did not look like a rocket or satellite or a little jet which I have seen on many occasions.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten letter describing a UFO sighting.

Dear Gentlemen:
I am the boy who witnessed the sighting on October 10. The umidentified observation. he was on Friday night October 6 that I saw it. I was coming home from watching TV 
it to you instantly, but my cousin noticed it first. Hamilton, Ohio, and told me about it. Within 10 minutes, he had seen it too. 
within 20 minutes, he had seen it 
minutes form when he had first observed it.
He estimated it was about 30 feet from all of the corners of the building. He called me at strange sight, large and round in years.
The main reason I am writing this is because I spend many hours watching these things. I have never seen anything like this before.

Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your letter reporting an unusual object sighted on October 10, 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to confirm such a sighting. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting should have been included. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force in October 1966, an evaluation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

I have attached some material on this subject which I think you will find interesting.

During the duration of the light, several people in the town felt definitely that we observed a small craft or object come toward out of the sky and hover near the area at an altitude of about 60 to 75 feet, and then ascend straight up at a very rapid rate of speed. When we observed this object it appeared to be a bright light at the intensity of the city lights and seemed to be a metallic color with a kind of glow around its edges. When we started to approach the object, it began to move rapidly upward out of sight. We felt definitely that we had observed and experienced a real phenomenon that could not be explained by any natural causes.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of Public Safety of West Virginia, dated November 2, 1966. The document describes an incident that occurred in Grafton, West Virginia on October 12, 1966, where a woman reported seeing an object with a red flame approximately three feet long, which she believed was going to crash. The document provides details about the woman's account of the incident, including her description of the object hovering or moving very slowly, parallel to her vehicle, and remaining in sight for several minutes before gaining altitude and passing out of sight over the hill to her left.

She stated it was going to crash. She further stated that she slowed her vehicle and watched the object. She stated it was completely stopped or hovering and giving off the red flame from the rear as previously described.

She stated that the object remained stationary and frightened when it began to move very slowly, parallel to her vehicle. She stated that the object remained in sight for several minutes before gaining altitude and passing out of sight over the hill to her left. She stated that she believed the object she was seeing was not a plane or helicopter, as it had no running lights such as those found on aircraft, and was completely silent in its operation.

Her description of the object is as follows: Approximately thirty to forty feet in diameter and three to four feet in mass at its thickest point. She stated it was giving off an exhaust or flame from the rear as previously described, the flame from the rear as previously described.

Proposed reply to letter from Jaimie Boone, 12 March 1967

Dear [redacted],

Reference your [redacted] letter reporting an unusual observation by you and others on 10 October 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force in October 1966, an evaluation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. 

I have enclosed some material in this reply which I think you will find interesting.

Coming home from work, we saw what appeared to be a large, bright light in the sky off to the left of the highway. It seemed to be hovering in the same spot and was moving very slowly from left to right as we watched it. We drove on and it seemed to disappear behind trees. We drove on and it reappeared again. This happened several times as we drove along the highway. We were a little puzzled by what we were seeing but thought it might be some type of aircraft or helicopter. We drove on and it appeared to move away from us and gradually disappeared from sight.

Dear Gentlemen:

During the October month, and my family and I witnessed a series of UFO sightings. 

One of the earliest sightings was seen by my daughter and myself. The time was approximately 10:45 p.m. An object, zoomed by above the school building, and seemed to change color on occasion. It had no blinking lights, and made no noise when the object passed by.

When the girls came home from a meeting, they both witnessed and ran away from an object. In the month of October, was when we witnessed the most sightings. 

I were in my dark room, I saw a series of lights on. As we were sightings, I glimpsed a large object approximately 50 feet above the neighboring houses. I would estimate the object was round and I saw much interference in UFO lights.

Then, we both suddenly knew it was one. I called my wife and others as I ran out to the back yard with camera. When I did so, it was gone. No trace at all, no rumble, no wind, nor a hum.

Later that night, after that sighting, I stood in my backyard for one hour and thirty minutes. The little one (approximately 50 feet) came close several times frantically, but it seemed to toy with my reactions.

Suddenly, it did another maneuver. We could not determine the incredible speed, although it was very low and very close. Air space movements seem most advanced, not advanced enough, however, for a visit with other speed.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch appears to be a simple line drawing depicting a circular or disc-shaped object with some additional details.

Around the last week of October, 1966, my wife and I were walking and suddenly spotted some strange still-looking stars. This, however, was nothing of the usual kind. We spotted what still looked like stars but they, all of a sudden, had doubled in size and were rapidly moving around, up and down, and sideways. This was still going on when, the next time I looked, they were gone. The first week of November, 1 had just come back from a visit with my mother. However, this one had and extraordinary light, much brighter than the ordinary one in mid-air. The time: 10:00p.m.

Since the late August. Since not only 1 but many of my friends have spotted numerous UFOs. I feel that I and my friends may have discovered an observation point readily by me.

Also, could you please send me some more information about Project Blue Book, and how I might help you with any observation records made by me.

Thank-you

Dear Gentlemen:

During the October month, I, [REDACTED] and my friend, [REDACTED], witnessed a series of UFO sightings.

One night approximately 9:30 p.m., we had seen a series of objects in the sky. It appeared to be about 8 to 10 in number and they were spread out in a line formation. An object, zoomed by above the school building, and then it disappeared. It had no blinking lights, and made no noise. When they passed over us, they did not appear to make any sound, and ran away rapidly.

In the month of October, was when we witnessed the many sightings. One night approximately 9:30 p.m., my friend and I saw a series of objects in the sky. They appeared to be approximately 150 to 200 feet above the neighbors house. We called attention to it and said, "do you think it is?" As soon as we brought attention to it, the objects increased in number, since we had noticed them. They started to move up and down, side to side, and going so fast as ran out to the back yard with Carol. When we got there, the objects were not seen.

Later that night, after my wife and gone home, I stood out the backyard with my two children. The little objects appeared again, approximately 150 to 200 feet above the ground. It did make any noise, and just hovered there. Suddenly, it did an amazing thing: it shot up in the sky with incredible speed. All through the night, we could see them, they were not advanced enough to have voice communication with them.

The image contains a handwritten sketch of what appears to be a UFO or aircraft. The sketch depicts an object with red lights and some labeling, including "RED" and "BLINKING O". There is no other photograph present in this image.

Around the last week of October, I was walking under the stars. Suddenly, I spotted a satellite (or supposed but this is doubtful) that appeared to stop. This startled me and an objective in my mind: Was it or wasn't it? After that when I looked back with my mother, she spotted a satellite and showed me something extra I had not seen. Then, the satellite (?) started moving, which was lighter than others I had seen. Sirs, I live in the Azores. Since not only I but many of my friends have spotted numerous UFOs, I feel that you may find something extra if you established an observatory here on the Lajes Air Force Base. Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Also, could you please send me some more information on Project Blue Book and how I might help you with any of my ideas possible?

Thank you.

Dear Sir:

I am writing to you as a result of an incident that occurred to me. About eight weeks ago, I was outdoors running and partly dark when I noticed to go in to 6:30 or 7:00 in the evening, and since it was partly dark I could not see very well. Just as we were almost home, I happened to see a blue light that I could see any shape my telescope. The sky was clear, and the moon bright. Everything was perfect still. As I watched what I thought was a bright star, it moved in a circular motion as if to clear the sky of something that was not a star. It was something know was not a star or anything like that. Something to the effect of being similar and then from the motion of lessening gradually the light became more and more scattered and gradually the light became more scattered and gradually became smaller and smaller and finally disappeared completely. It was something I know was not a star or anything like that. Something to the effect of being similar and then from the motion of lessening gradually the light became more and more scattered and gradually the light became more scattered and gradually became smaller and smaller and finally disappeared completely.

Reference your letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object over the town of Keflavik, Iceland. Your observation was indeed interesting and would be extremely difficult to investigate your sighting since it occurred outside the continental limits of the United States. Also there has been a time lag in your observation of the object. Your sighting will be filed for information purposes.

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],
The President has asked that I reply to your letter of Oct. 1, concerning the aerial object you and your husband observed at approximately 9:30 p.m. October 1.
Possibly, you saw "Echo 2" or another satellite or object in earth orbit. Echo 2 is position over Alaska (east of Martain Polar path 9312 path), to degrees north, 70 degrees west. To degrees north, 70 degrees west. Because of the shape and perigee of the satellite, Echo 2 probably would have been visible not longer than 10 minutes.
It is possible that you viewed some other man-made object in orbit. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge reports that there are over 3,800 man-made objects in earth orbit, approximately 800 of which are regularly tracked and visible at various times. 
Some of these objects are in an orbit higher than Echo 2 and therefore would be visible longer than 10 minutes.
We hope this information is helpful.
Sincerely,
[SIGNATURE]

Dear Sir:
Several saucer-like objects were observed passing overhead. They were spotted and all objects flying in the sky. They say they were flying saucer-like objects. I watched them thru binoculars. Something (had to have been) going faster than anything I have ever seen. It was about the size of a moon and was going towards the north. What looked like a small disc I would say was about 9:30 pm on the evening of October 8, 1966.

The report of unidentified sighting.
The object reportedly passed low
directly over. The object was quite
brilliant and seemed to move
erratically with a bright light on
one side and a white light on the other
side. At times it hovered and at
other times it seemed to dart very
rapidly in one direction or another.
The viewing time was about 10
minutes. There was no sound associated
with the object.

I would not know how to report it or what good it might do. I have no way of knowing if some one else saw it. I gave a vivid description to my wife who was with me. I thought it might be a helicopter but it was too large and fast. I thought it might be a plane but it was not flying like any plane I ever saw. I just don't know what it was."

SIGHTING OF ORANGE LIGHTING
Persons making sighting:
Rushville, Ind. Age 20, employed - International Harvester
Glenwood, Ind. Age 22, employed D-H Co Gernet

Date of sighting: Set. Sept 24, 1966 at approx. 8:20 PM
Sky conditions: Clear, very dark night, no moon, no wind, normal night conditions.
Observed light sources: Approximately 3 brilliant flashes of orange red light, one second duration with approx. one second interval between each flash. The color was similar to the tail of a comet but smaller in size. The center of the flashes emitted a steady light approx. 1/3 that much smaller still. The entire size of the flashes was about 3 times the size of a standard flash of lightning.
Note: The object observed appeared as 3 brilliant flashes of orange red light. There was an approx. 1 second interval between each flash. The entire display lasted 2-3 seconds. The object then disappeared. It did not appear to have a definite shape or size. The witnesses could not determine the distance, direction of motion, or altitude of the object.
Increases were sited, however, on the Orange Pike which is located in Rushville, County. When about 1/2 mile southwest of Glenwood this strange object was observed. The witnesses could not determine if the object was airborne or on the ground. It appeared to be far over a field near the Madison River. On two other occasions they observed, at the same location, a similar flashing of light over a field between 8 and 9 PM and a stationary light which appeared to be on the ground. They reported their sightings to the Porter Field of the Air Force but could obtain no further information.

CAMERON SIGHTING

Persons making sighting: Ronald G. Cameron, 809 Bushville, Ind. Phone 932-2325, employed - produce Clark, Kroger Co.; Christine Hildreth, wife - Judy Cameron, age 20, house wife.  

Date of sighting: Oct. 5, 1966 at approx. 10:00 PM
Locality of observation: 3/4 mile on State Road 44 west of Rushville Ind.
Sky conditions: clear, no moon.
Total time object was estimated 6 minutes. Sound heard estimated 15 or 20 seconds by the witnesses. Also brother Rannie Cameron, sister Diana Cameron and sister in law.

Narrative: Judy heard what she described as a screeching sound. She looked out the window and seen a blinking red light going southeast at approx 70 degrees elevation. Sister in law next house next experienced TV interference when the sound was heard. The Cameron TV was on and they got up to investigate the sound. It sounded like grinding or moderate volume, and no other sound was heard. He looked out the rear window of the home and said a red light side by side. They were about the same size as ordinary light seen from a distance. It from unnatural to a steady red light. He said the light appeared to be hovering above a field in a 35 direction. Barely above the tree tops. The sound that was watched the light first appeared to be a little louder, lasted an estimated 6 minutes. Some police dogs in a pen next door put up a commotion, but they didn't know. Suddenly the lights started moving, it is what appeared to be a straight up direction. It instantaneously 7 seconds he lost sight of them. He came to the door and looked but could not see them again. His brother got their gun and went out across the field in the direction the lights were seen. He said they were looking for prowlers (having seen motherships with them lately) and "nothing seen".

No more saw them than I did - but I know that when another so called air force spokes-man state air security crashed out "unidentif-ied aircraft over our Thule Radar on Christmas eve" all tho enclosed are all my sightings that amount to much except one checked for fact or fiction, I have identified about 15 of these as hot air balloons or nothing more than cars. Since I hope something more is secured to limit information of witness unreliabiliit, I have been busy for four months) I hope something more is secured to limit this "under the radar" vest.

Dear Sir,

I know I won't get any answer to this but feel I should write and tell you what I saw on the night of the 8th of October 1966 over here in this district. I am partially your joke to solving some unbelievable sights of these non existent flying objects (UFO) over here in this district.

I am just now digging out of a wave of sightings that hit in October. I'm sure, you've the C.I.r. how have approximately 15 persons who have observed these sightings on the night of 25 the September and all who were reliable persons, witnesses, respected wife, and all the other obstacles and complaints, findings etc. which we blumming assisting to.

But if I have anything that would be of interest to you, I hope you are welcome to it. I KNOw ALL THE TECBNY vs. OF WHAT THE EXPERTS explain. THIS AIR FORCE ITS SELF UNSURE IF ANYTHING UNUSUAL THEY HAPPEN TO KNOW.

Death. If you got any drive for the nights of Oct 5 or 21 they will receive the radar tapes for relay to Texas and a reply came tower area. Any chance tonight.

If on Oct. 18 about 1:00 or you got five strange sightings this never happens to us up here.

On Oct 6 starting at 9:59 & until 1:00 you should have had at least fifty or so ring sightings, giving blips in this area. I think the two planes were too high to make a ground contact.

Sometime during the middle of October some farmers got excited about something and ran on the bottom hold at in the news indicating making a trialing balloon the noise were there. I don't know if this was the reason of the sightings or not.

Also some new witnesses who approach to the Citizens Band Radio Ganger this started to saying they see these UFO. I think it is about the same time the sheriff dept. started to saying we have some more sightings.

On the morning of 31 Oct. 21 your radar should have had a fairly good direction. This was what you saw last night without a doubt it the objects that provided.

A little about 00:30 and soon after 0400 there were sightings this I thought perhaps I might be able to do something for my side. I can put your figures in a special report and forward it if you wish.

Your, Truly

He was urged on the evening of the 5th. After school Obs. B drove in delight scene and soon discovered the vehicle they had seen still stood in same small area. He also noticed a small spot of light red dirt like material on the lawn where the truck stood. But he did not pay much attention to the the no big deal might his uncle did he noticed it. He looked in southward direction but didn't see anything strange closed the gate the police about the incident on the 27 year old sister In law. took her to more and forever recorded about what the boys actually saw. the case were Choices missing any vehicle tracks and there were none.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90° 75° A
60°
45° 
30°
15°
0° B

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.

Locality of Observation: East Connellsville, Ind. Seen by witnesses who stood at the end of John St. and viewed object in the air above them. No attached drawing or map.

Weather Conditions and Visibility: Near total darkness, cool and cloudy, no wind, no mist or fog, no rain four previous days.

Total Time Seen: From 2 and 1/2 to nearly five minutes.

Narrative:
On Tuesday the day before, one of our young witnesses, C.B., was delivering his papers on John st. at approximately 5:15 pm. when he noticed a group of lights in the field west of the street. He glanced at them and since they seemed to move, he was interested.
On Wednesday morning the boys were delivering their papers and usually keeping within a block or two of home, when caught up in their pqpers a bright light appeared in the eastern sky. Invited by a friend to come down to the end of John st. and see the new lights, thinking perhaps they might be his little. As they approached the site of activity, they observed that the lights had formed a semicircle and remained since the night before. 
And were a little more to the north. The boys sat on their bikes and stared transfixed and were a little afraid at a dark object with lights some 200 yards or so in the distance. One said to me that shouldnt be. (See attached sheet for the boys' drawings of what they could see.)
Obs. A heard a plain high pitched whine coming from the direction of the object. It has been suggested that this was a sound blower on it and forgot this business they were not using it at this time. Both of the boys said it sounded like a mixture of sulphur and tumus said. Our young witnesses are both interested in science and when questioned as to where the sound was coming from, stated it seemed to come from the object itself. The sound of something sounding slowly through the woods and bushes in the field. Obs. A said it seemed to reverberate and sounded like a person walking.

The text in the document is as follows:

Verifiable Fact No 1. 
As have actual photographic proof of the cases impressed in the sky over them as they were landing and taking off. In the opinion of his scientific attitude, that could so discovered.

Verifiable Fact No 2. 
The individuals are of the better type of American boy, intelligent family or background. There is absolutely no possibility of hoaxery considered. Whatsoever on their part. In the opinion and judgment of the other, questions were repeated at different times and indications looked for.

Verifiable Fact No 3. 
The individuals were of quiet fields to land on way land here, why not. For an unknown length of time. One could be observed a great similarity in this area, A.S the observation and the close connection to the way the police team, questioned individuals. And subsequently put certain questions to them as to what they saw and thought about it.

Verifiable Fact No 4.
When this sighting is came to its proper context with four independent individuals, and of the highest type of American young man. And careful observers, from my observations far this one is the most credible, one of it's kind that I have came across.

Sightings 1 and 2:Several sightings which there have been on over a period of seeing friends or neighbors of a person seeing objects.

Visual landing is interesting inasmuch as it becomes an object of credence.  It is not to be it is in one nights. Another sighting this sort of objects seem very high potential power to descending.

Now, this one-station unverified, the connection with this event, we have the credence and distance believers in a correct from seeing the body's mind and go back to living their had in.

Obs. A description and drawing of the object:
The edge of the object was solid and smooth but it didn't reflect light evenly. Its contours were the under part. He couldn't see the top or the sides clearly. Lights pulasted so rapidly that they remember, lights. He didn't remember where they were on the object except lights pulsated so rapidly. They were found and about 1/4 mile in size of a light. The objects size was 27 ft. long and 10 ft. high after observing an auto 1/2 mile away. It was found that the object just have been a could not have seen it at all.

Obs. B description and drawing of the object:
Seen a dark curved shape. He said it would be the same as if you shut all the lights in a house. You could still see a dark something. He saw at least 8 distinct bright clear bright lights - they were a little bigger than ordinary house lights in between he could see faint dim lights. They pulsated slowly. Dont remember the estimated distance between the end lights 2 was 23 foot apart and 6 after observing two 4 inch lights in the field at the same distance.

The adult witness and the boys estimated the boys to be 9 feet from the object at a distance. The adult witness said the boys were about 7 inches off the distance. This appears to be a cone shaped hose and 4 3 estimated red appears to be in the 7 or 8 inches in diameter. The top edge curves and not even the winds blowing as the top edge disturbed the ground as it flew near did not when the boys were fairly shocked and winds hard. Can be said that it was like a flier than wild had swiveled on it and then drilled in the rush.

COX SIGHTING
Persons making sighting: Roy Cox, Rutherford, Phone 698 2314, Age 39
Ford M-G Machine Maintenance Man, Special Training: Electronics School
Date of sighting: Oct. 6, 1966 between 10:30 and 11:00 PM
Locality of sighting: On Bridge road 2/1 9 miles south of Somerville. 
Sky conditions: Clear, starry, no moon, a bright crescent moon.
Total time seen: 30 or 20 seconds at most.
Narrative:
A witness who has a citizen band radio in his car was driving home bound on Highway 22 and had passed through the traffic light from the south at about 300 or 400 feet and an estimated 1/2 mile away from the object. As the witness approached a small hill south of the bridge and crested the hill, he noticed a light above the top of a large house on a hill south of the bridge and discovered that the object had made a sharp turn to return eastward over the top of the hill. And as he looked up, the highway about 150 yards down.
The object was described as being round, about 6 feet in diameter, of a whitish or bluish color, brighter than the stars and moon and with no visible means of propulsion. It made no sound and was moving at a high speed, fast enough to take it out of sight in about 20 to 30 seconds. The witness said he made an effort to keep it in sight as long as possible but lost it as it went over the hill. He believes the object may have returned to the point from which it came as he saw no trail. The object showed no trail, no exhaust and no markings.
Note: The fact that the witness driving object troughed had to be sure in the sighting. He seemed to be uncertain of what he saw, though he firmly believes in them.

JACK L. TERRY SIGHTING
(Civilian Band Radio Group)

Persons - Jack L. Terry, employee, Gen. Motors, Irvington, Ind. Age. 37, 
2115 N.E. 21st. Ave., Pompano Beach, Florida. Occupation - Chief Shift Engineer - 5 yrs. 
Assn. A. Civilian Band Radio Group - 13 members. 
Date: 10-7-66 
Time: 19:45 ES'I'
Location: Intersection of Rt. 79 & Rt. 34 Lincroft, New Jersey
(Conservative) sightings.

Data of Sighting: On 10-7-66 Terry and 13 members of his Civilian Band Radio Group were on a break in their regular operations. Terry reports they observed a very large glowing, brightly lit object approach from the S.E. at high speed. Object passed directly overhead at high speed, changed direction to the N.E. and departed at high speed. Object was clearly defined, had no wings, tail, jets or propulsion system visible. It was a solid glowing, possibly rotating object. The light emitted was strong enough to light up the surrounding countryside and vehicles as it passed overhead. Duration was 2 1/2 minutes.

Narrative: The sightings are wife and children were located on Rt. 79 near Lincroft, N.J. at 19:45 EST. They were simply out for a ride and their car radio was on. Some 13 members of the Citizen Band Radio Group, including Jack L. Terry, were monitoring their handheld radios in this same general area of the intersection of Rt. 79 & 34. Suddenly, the entire group observed a very large, brilliantly lighted object approaching from the S.E. at high speed.

The object passed directly overhead at a high rate of speed. The light was so brilliant that the surrounding trees, automobile, and countryside below were clearly illuminated. The object itself had no visible wings, tail, jets or other form of propulsion system. It appeared to be a solid, glowing, possibly rotating structure. 

As the object passed overhead, it changed direction sharply to the N.E. and departed at high speed. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 2 1/2 minutes.

Jack Terry states that this was the most dramatic and best sighting he has ever had. He has had numerous other sightings over the years, but this one was outstanding in its clarity, duration and close proximity. Several other witnesses in the area also observed the same object.

"Finally, it looked like a very other-worldly craft and was lost in the western sky. Then it was gone."

A flying object - shape first reminds me of a lemon sorbet but as it turned and headed towards me the shape became more of a cigar. The object was a silvery color and seemed to be emitting a slight haze or glow. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and yet was practically silent. There was definitely some type of vehicle or device - it was not an airplane, balloon or meteor. I was really quite surprised and puzzled by what I saw.

As it got over his position, he said it became very bright and high. He thought he had seen two of these objects but was only sure of one. These object took off at a terrific speed. One said "I don't like this, I think I'll get out of here." He said he could not take pics' as he did not have a camera. He said the object was little larger (than a) silver dollar and round. He noticed it gave off a bright light as it flew across the sky. The object took off at an awful fast speed and was out of sight in about 10 to 15 seconds. On the way home he was shaky and excited while his wife sid he was pale and excited when he got home. Background Information: His wife said he was pale and excited when this all happened and wanted to go out and investigate further but it would have been dark.

Objects did descend the object he followed was approximately same size of length. The objects were triangular or cone shaped with no sound. The bright object had a white or light colored light in the front and the other 2 did not. The middle of the triangular-shaped object had a reddish glow. 

Note: Parsons different sighting I.e. when caller will have so instrumental in getting it so was due to the objects somewhat moving further way. He kept cautioning anyone may be known if this may wind up in divorce case.

Time of sighting: 12 pm
Duration of sighting: The site was approx. 400 yds to the east.
Description of sighting: The site was on a country road near the intersection of rt 35 and rt 36, Hazlet N.J. Total time seen as approx. 15 minutes.
Narrative: Police Capt. Van Wicke came in from the area north of the city, watching the strange objects in the sky. He told me to go out there and take a look. I rushed out but it was gone. There was a full moon and the other two were smaller, with one being only a third as bright as the other. He turned and told us that's what he saw. (exact copies of what we saw? except as to size, color, etc.)
They were bright and luminously bright. The largest seemed to be 75 to 100 feet in diameter and at the tail end of the largest there seemed to be some "gyrating" and it seemed to be leaving behind a bright trail of light. This turned into a curve tail. During the sighting the tail always remained in the same position relative to the object. The tail was approx. 1/10 the diameter of the object. The objects made no sound. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
Investigator Clark said "I don't know what they were, but I am sure the police officers were not afraid of the objects as public as they seem to be."

It was a very bright white light that shown like a star. It appeared about half the size of the moon. It appeared about 15 degrees above the horizon and seemed to be drifting slowly toward the west. Suddenly it began to move toward the NE and its speed increased. Now viewed through trees it glowed brightly down to earth. By 3 minutes it crossed the sky and passed out of sight. It was LCC fast, about 70 degrees elevation at about 20 or 25 miles per hour. It was going so slow he thought it almost hover. Then it shot out of sight.

Duration of sighting: 16 to 12 minutes.
Sky conditions: Clear, little light in west.

Narrative:
Siggers was in car going north out of Arlington. The very bright light in the east was seen to bob up and down rapidly over a core area. Bright objects seemed to be a wheeling, circling, turning on or off; and light approached each other. As light approached, it became so bright we couldn't look at it directly. Observers had stopped their car. Some 20-30 seconds later more bright lights appeared in the sky, and still others moved along the ground.
Observer guessed height at 200 ft? The powerful white light went out, brightness could be seen for perhaps a mile. When the thing was not visible, steady for 10 or 15 seconds, then it started to blink again, seems to move toward the west. That ended the performance. The object was hidden by the low hills during most of the sighting.

This also seemed to indicate her that it did understande going toin the interview because of the way she felt about the incident. was the 5 objects launching or that looked like to her. The said it was much that she need her family at amds against the inc except for the awe as to what she had to previous say "the she cane seen with people and wore a paper and we caine and everyone was with her at the time ." I would doubt it would boe understandable that she could. I would almost doubt it.

Total time seen: She was uncertain, over 5 minutes?

Narrative:
Mrs. Remy came in from outside and said "I saw some outside and he said he saw something outside of the wire and just looked at it". Iarel said he always laughed at the whole idea of such things. So all three went outside to look at the lights. They said the object was not as large and bright as a full moon. It was red color, 3/4 the size of a full moon. It had stopped still and was hovering there. The top and bottom due south of them. The husband now changed his mind and said this was the object they had seen before. He said it moved to the southeast. Suddenly the object made a leap thru the air and the length of the jump thru the sky was estimated as at least 500 feet for the jump. It was bright enough to light up the surrounding area for 1/2 to a full second like daylight. It then stopped instantly. It as motionless stationary for several minutes then suddenly made another leap of the same distance. After the second jump it would stay motionless again. It was doing this in a zig-zag fashion, changing directions each time at a right angle. As it comes up so great that on the next it spread and seemed to hover. It traveled at a speed that would not blur the vision of the object. As it came up so close to them while hovering and staying still, then it suddenly seemed to move around the object in a horizontal plane as if the object itself turned without changing its position. A dim grayish hazy outline that would not blur the lights. One time it came so close to them they had to duck to avoid its apparent path. It passed high overhead going west. As the object moved further north it began and growing dimmer from sight.

Note: The radar at a nearby airfield was said to be "disturbed" at the time, but the witnesses could not confirm this.

Note: The object observed appeared as one brilliant flash or three brief flashes very close together. The duration of the flash was about 1-2 seconds. There was no sound. The object or objects were moving in a general west to east direction at a considerable speed. Approximately 1/3 the size of the full moon. The center gave off a brilliant glow - around which were four smaller satellite objects. These were observed under several different locations during the affair. It is the opinion of the witness that they could have been part of some distant aircraft, they traveled over country roads and at times disappeared and again came into view, apparently they were quite distant from the observer. The witness stated it or them was bright enough to see the outline of nearby trees.

The image contains a diagram that appears to be from a Project Blue Book report. The diagram is labeled "Official U.S. Air Force" and it includes a sketch showing what appears to be the sighting of a UFO. There is also a radar-type diagram with several markings and labels.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appears above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
