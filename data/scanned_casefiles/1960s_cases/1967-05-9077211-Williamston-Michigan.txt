May 9, 1967

Dear Sir:

I am sending you a sample of a substance I found in our low land in back of our home. I found this while mushrooming. I was concerned as I had seen a spaceship in that area sometime ago.

I was wondering if this could have any bearing on this. I did not say any thing about this as people think you out of your mind, if you see this sort of thing. I feel however that I should report this now. I left some of this where I found it in a case someone would want to see the way it was found and how. I found this on May 4th.

I would very much like to know what this is if you know. It may be something you can explain right away, if so, please let me know.

Thank You
Williamston, Mich. 48895

Proposed reply to letter from -------, 9 May 1967

Dear Mrs.------

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning a substance found near your home on May 4, 1967. The material was identified as "radar chaff." This material is dropped by military aircraft in the vicinity of a radar station. This is done to confuse the radar operators so that the aircraft can penetrate the radar defense. There must have been one of these radar exercises in your area.

We wish to thank you for submitting the material to the Air Force for analysis.
