10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A "round disc" or "ball-like" object, blue or blue-white in color. Various descriptive terms used to describe the ball in regard to size. "Burned out" before hitting ground. All observers saw the object to the S, possibly over the Gulf of Mexico. It was moving E-W or possible SE-NW. One observer estimated altitude as "above 30,000 ft." Appeared 180° true N, 15-60° fm horizon. Disappeared 180° fm true N, 30° fm horizon.

11. COMMENTS
Description and duration is characteristic of a meteor entering the earth's atmosphere. There were a large number of witnesses, indicating that it was a fairly large meteor which penetrated the lower reaches of the earth's atmosphere where it burned out before reaching the earth's surface.
