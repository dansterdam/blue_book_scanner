1961

sighting "trip" in Maine last February 7th and 8th included several fairly de-
tailed descriptions. One of the best reports came from - a man who was driving
on the Maine turnpike at 2:40 a.m. on February 9th. He became aware of a "ter-
rible brilliance" which lit up the whole upper left hand corner of the wind-
shield. As he watched in amazement, a spherical-shaped object - brilliant put
green as compared with a hazy red across the sky for moments. He watched.
He said it was ten times brighter than a shooting star and was trailed by a
cone-shaped tail of sparks. There was a brilliant flash of light. Almost the
an explosion as the object disappeared below the horizon.

This sighting was reported to 99DCOI through the intercession of Mr. [redacted], to whom it was originally reported by Mr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] only after hearing that Ludlow police had reported a similar sighting. Reference our 99DCOI 1455. Mr. [redacted] indicates that Mr. [redacted] is a reliable individual not given to fancy. In fact, he states that he did not report it at the time because he did not wish to appear to be a "crackpot." This report, aside from the time factor, agrees but that it was close to dawn as the sky was already lightening in the east.
