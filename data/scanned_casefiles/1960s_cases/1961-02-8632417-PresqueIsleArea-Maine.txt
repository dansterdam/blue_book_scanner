The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a description of an incident that occurred in the Presque Isle area of Maine on February 9, 1961. The text describes a sighting of a "flashing 'flying object' in the sky" that had "brilliant brilliance" and "lit up the whole upper part of the sky" before disappearing below the horizon. The document does not mention or identify any humans.

No Case (Information only.)
9 February 1961 
Maine

The sighting "may" in Maine last 7th and 8th included several reports of sightings of one or more "flying objects brilliance" which "lit up the whole upper part of the sky." The object or objects were seen by many people in the Presque Isle, Maine, area. It had "brilliant brilliance" which lit up the whole upper part of the sky. It was hovering, raising, and darting motions at first, then suddenly shot up and away becoming smaller and smaller like an explosion as the object disappeared below the horizon. No explosion on the object, just a disappearance was noted.

The sighting was reported to 99DCOC through the intercession of Mr. [redacted], to whom it was originally reported by Mr. [redacted]. According to the interceding individual, this report is a reliable individual not given to flights of fancy. In fact, he states that he told the individual not to report it since he did not wish to become involved with such reports. He adds that the individual stated that he was reluctant to report it well with our cited report. Mr. [redacted] states that he did not check the time, but that it was close to dawn as already lightening in the east.
