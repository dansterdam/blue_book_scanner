PFD Form 164

Baltimore, Maryland

To whom it may concern:
I would like to report an Unidentified Flying Object. I saw it in the N.W. section of Baltimore MD. It was a white oval shaped object that was hovering around. It was a small object. After about five minutes it sped away at a tremendous speed. Three minutes later another object came along. It hovered for ten minutes and sped away also in tremendous speed. I have seen other objects but this is the most recent experience.
