Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output it:

Description: Mr. Davis reports seeing a brightly lit, metallic-appearing object hovering silently 5 miles northwest of Copemish, Michigan at 2300 EST on 8 July 1961. The object was egg-shaped, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and had a metallic, reflective surface. It was estimated to be approximately 500-600 feet in altitude.
