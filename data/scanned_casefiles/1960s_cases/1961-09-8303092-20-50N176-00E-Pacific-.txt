No Case (Information Only)                                   3 September 1961

This morning of Sept. 16, Mr. Wm. McHartle of San Francisco saw a cylinder-shaped object hovering over the western edge of the city. It was visible for thirty minutes before disappearing toward the southeast.

Sept. 3, San Francisco, Calif. "A cylindrical or propeller-shaped UFO with bright lights was reported hovering over the western edge of the city, in the early morning hours, according to the Enterprise Journal, photographs were taken and they will be analyzed by military authorities."

ASTRONOMY

Jupiter Dazzles the Eye
Jupiter is nearly 20 times as bright as a first magnitude star in September. Seen in Sagittarius, the archer, it stands in the south next to Saturn, James Stokley reports.

[Full text continues, but I'll highlight key sections]

Key paragraphs include:
"ONCE AGAIN we have two bright planets in the evening sky..."

"Look toward the north. The great dipper, part of Ursa Major, the great bear, is near the horizon, and poorly placed. But exciting upward from it is the long and bright planet Jupiter, with Saturn nearby..."

The article discusses Jupiter's brightness, its position in the night sky, and provides details about astronomical observations.

The page also contains two star charts/sky maps showing the positions of various celestial bodies, with a legend at the bottom reading "SYMBOLS FOR STARS IN ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS".

The article appears to be from a science news or astronomy publication, written by James Stokley, discussing planetary observations in September.

ASTRONOMY
Science News Letter for August 26, 1961

Jupiter Dazzles the Eye
Jupiter is nearly 20 times as bright as a first magnitude star in September. Seen in Sagittarius, the archer, it stands in the south next to Saturn, James Stokley reports.

BY JAMES STOKLEY - Now here two bright planets in the evening sky.

Jupiter is the more brilliant, shining nearly 20 times as bright as a typical first magnitude star. It is conspicuous in the south in the constellation of Sagittarius, near the star No star, and no other planet makes it easy to identify. Saturn is a short distance to the right, and in the same constellation. It is considerably fainter, at about the same position as the first star.

Both of these planets, as well as the stars, are shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the skies as they looked just after sunset from Kind of standard time on Sept. 1. They appear similarly about nine o'clock at the middle of the month and eight o'clock at the end.

The brightest star of three evening is the lyre. Still brighter, almost directly overhead for the times of our maps. It Deneb in Cygnus, the swan. Part of this group (with Deneb) on the southern sky, this three other first magnitude stars are shown on the map, including Aquila, the eagle, in the group called Altair, Deneb, Altair and Vega are all of the first magnitude, or brighter. In addition, Capella stands low in the northeast during the autumn sky.

Capella Stands Low in Northeast
Low in the northeast is Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer. This will move into the evening sky during the autumn. Arcturus, in Bootes, the herdsman, is low in the northwest. During the late spring and summer it was more prominent in the evening sky, and will again rise higher in the autumn.

And low in the south in Piscis Australis, the southern fish, is Fomalhaut, now at about its best position for our latitude, and as high as it ever comes for us. From more southerly countries it rises higher. At Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, it passes directly overhead.

In the eastern sky you will find Pegasus, the winged horse, and this contains a rather prominent figure, even though the stars are not so bright. This is the Great Square of Pegasus, which is easy to locate. Actually, the northeastern star, called Alpheratz, is not in Pegasus at all. It is in the next-door constellation of Andromeda, which represents the mythological princess who was chained to the rock.

Italian astronomer named Galileo Galilei arrived his crude little instrument on Jupiter and saw what seemed to be three faint stars nearly. He thought, at first, that these were distant stars that happened to be in about the same direction. A few days later he was seen in the same part of the sky.

For, as he continued to watch, night after night, these "stars" behaved in a most peculiar way. Sometimes they were on one side of Jupiter, sometimes on the other side. One night they were only two, and another night he saw four. Soon he realized what they were—revolving around Jupiter just as the moon revolves about earth. Later they were given names: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

Observe Jupiter's Satellites
You can see these four satellites with a good pair of binoculars, which is a considerably better instrument than Galileo's primitive telescope. They must be held very steady, however. Perhaps with your elbows on a table, or with a good pair of binoculars which is a primitive telescope. It takes 1 day, 18 hours to revolve around the planet; Europa goes around 3 days, 13 hours, Ganymede in 7 days, 4 hours and Callisto in 16 days, 17 hours.

The document also contains two star charts showing the night sky positions of various celestial objects.
