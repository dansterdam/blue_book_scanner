10. CONCLUSION
Possible AIRCRAFT

The observer did not give his complete address. No other reports were received of anything crashing in the Columbus area. It is possible that the observer saw an airplane disappear over the horizon thus giving the appearance that it crashed.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a white, blue, and red object (?) about of his position. The object or lights were observed for 5-6 minutes and at the end of the sighting appeared to crash.

AFR 59-17(C1)

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
