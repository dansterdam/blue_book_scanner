Report:
Flying saucer div. 
From where I stood looking out across side about right I noticed a dark object hovering over the top of a group of trees a few hundred yards away. I counted 10-15 seconds. The object appeared to be a round or disc shaped thing about 10-15 feet in diameter. Nothing that the best was to describe it was to say that the object was 10 feet high and I stood 25 yards away and watched it closely. 
In having a parachute bottom, I had it completely covered on another object and sand lotter effect was not seen. 
While I called to my brother's attention, she noticed it also. Said it looked like a light bulb, but gave out streaks of light.

Sighting of 'Unidentified Objects' at 4:30 p.m. on 7 March 1962 in Lincoln Park, Michigan
At about 4:30 p.m. on 7 March 1962, a witness, while driving along Dix Street in Lincoln Park, Michigan, observed three unidentified objects in the sky. The witness reported the sighting to the Lincoln Park Police Department, which in turn reported it to the nearby Willow Run Radar Station.
The witness stated that the objects were at an estimated altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet, and that they were moving at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. The witness further stated that the objects appeared to be a dull gray or silver color and were approximately the size of a basketball. The witness also reported that the objects were making a high-pitched whining sound and that they appeared to be metallic in nature.
The witness was able to observe the objects for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before they disappeared from sight. The witness stated that the objects were moving in a straight line and that they did not appear to be affected by the wind. The witness also reported that the objects were not affected by the jet aircraft that were in the area at the time.
The Lincoln Park Police Department contacted the Willow Run Radar Station, which confirmed that they had detected the objects on their radar screens. The Willow Run Radar Station also reported that they had observed the objects moving at a high rate of speed and that they had disappeared from their radar screens at the same time as the witness had reported.
The incident was reported to the U.S. Air Force and was investigated as part of Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. government program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The investigation was unable to determine the nature or origin of the objects, and the incident remains classified as an unidentified flying object.

Dear sir:

Cause of sighting: Bright light object with a trail. Subject sighting was on May 27, 1962, while driving along Lincoln Park, Michigan, with 4 other persons in the car. The object was first observed about 20 feet above the ground, moving very rapidly in a southwesterly direction. It was observed for approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The object appeared to be round with a bright, pulsating light. There was a white trail visible behind the object. The object appeared to diminish in size as it moved away. No sound was heard.

As there were 4 people in the car who also observed the object, I believe the sighting to be authentic. The object was not a conventional aircraft, as it had no wings or tail, and its speed and maneuverability were far beyond that of any known aircraft.

UFO 8-47 23 1962
At about 8:15-8:30 p.m. on April 23, 1962 I noticed two weird looking objects east of Lincoln Park, Michigan.
They appeared to be floating or hovering in the sky and remained stationary for over a half an hour.
They were about the size of standard electric light bulbs but longer and more slender. They emitted a steady stream of standard electric light.
They seemed to be as close as a electric light setting, although there was no standard type of electric light anywhere near the scene.
A few times the lights would get dimmer and then return to normal in a couple of seconds.
I checked against buildings by standing and it was lower than the electric light utility poles to the west.
The objects remained in about the same spot for over 30 minutes less than 200 ft away.
But still is last i had that this is a aerial phenomena. I cannot explain what i actually saw.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
