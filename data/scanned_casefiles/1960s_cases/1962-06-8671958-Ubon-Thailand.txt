Gentlemen:

Until recently, I was in the U.S. Army on active duty in Thailand. On 29 June 1962 information was received that an unidentified flying object was seen in Ubon, Thailand. This sighting was known to U.S. Air Force personnel stationed at the USAF Radar Detachment on Ubon, Thailand. Those who saw the object described it as being "like a large yellow sun" and it was that Commander of the Ubon USAF Radar Detachment called personnel in Korea, Thailand at the time, also had knowledge of its existence.

While in Thailand, I became interested in unidentified flying objects. As an example, one is a biophysicist who is very interested in aerial phenomena. In accordance with standard security measures, I wish to know the following:

(1) Are some details regarding this case, 1962, available?
(2) If so, exactly what information is unclassified?
(3) Is the detailed official report, with official conclusions, available?

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
