Gentlemen:

Until recently, I was in the U. S. Army on active duty in Thailand.

On 20 Jun 62, an incident involving unidentified flying objects took place near Ubon, Thailand. This sighting was known to U. S. Air Force Brigadier General Seagraves NBCBIG, who was then Commander of the Air Force Component of Joint Task Force 116, Army General James Richardson, who was in Korea, Thailand at the time, also had knowledge of it.

Even though well over one year has passed, I would like to discuss this with maintenance of mine. For example, one is a polychroic who is very interested in aerial phenomena.

So, in accordance with standard security measures, I wish to know the following:

(1) Are some details regarding this June, 1962 incident classified?

(2) If so, exactly what information is unclassified?

(3) Is the detailed official report, with official conclusions, available?

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]
