Dear Sir:

At 12:33 A.M. on this day while walking our dog at the rear of the address, my wife spotted an object of brilliant light intensity travelling with great speed in a Northerly direction. She immediately called me at the house and was quite upset. She was uncertain whether or not we had any known satellites travelling in a due South to due North direction. After the object was no longer visible I called Civil Defense who in turn referred me to Major Dixon or UFO. He in turn referred it to your command.

Details are as follows:

Direction:     Due South to due North veering slightly to the East but maintaining North course.

Length of time:    12:33 A.M. to 12:36 A.M.

Sighted:     Directly overhead (90 deg.) to disappearance at horizon to North.

Intensity:    More brilliant than any star or the moon which was clearly visible at the time.

Size:     About the size of a pea.

Altitude:     Approximately 100 to 150 miles up.

Color:     Remained a brilliant white without any surrounding colors and no visible contrails.

Sound:     None.

Visibility:   Extremely clear night. Light thin clouds occasionally ( not heavy enough to block vision or stars or gray passed between the stars and the earth ) indicated extremely strong North to South winds at high altitude.

Other objects:    After call to Civil Defense and again going outside a Southeast to Northeast contrail was visible indicating a jet of a single engine type may be in the area although no sound was heard.

INITIALS CWS

ADDITIONAL REMARKS BY OBSERVER: Immediately following the disappearance of this object I observed a single contrail suggested a Jet aircraft. The contrail appeared almost directly overhead and on a course of SE to an area of the "object".

COMMENT: Mr [redacted] appeared sure that he saw something out of the ordinary. He evidenced no excitement over this sighting. In my opinion his guess as to the altitude would suggest he saw one of the satellites, possibly the "ECHO" satellite.
