- page 1 -

The image appears to contain a photograph or image that is very faint and difficult to make out. The text mentions that the response letter will include information related to the flight characteristics, angular velocity and diameter, sound, duration of sighting, etc., as reported in the observation letter. However, the photograph or image itself is not clear enough for me to describe in detail.

Proposed reply to letter from _____:
Reference your letter explaining your unusual observation 15 December 1966. Without essential data such as flight characteristics, angular velocity and diameter, sound, duration of sight, etc. we cannot make an official statement regarding your observation. 
There is no charge for the information. 
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
