Chemical Cloud Releases

The Aerial Phenomena Branch has recently received reports of unidentified flying objects over the northern United States. Mr. Karl Medow of the Goddard Space Flight center suggested that we contact you in regards to information on chemical cloud releases from Fort Churchill during the last few weeks. Specifically, we are interested in launches on 27 July 1967 on or about 2300 CDT and again on 3 August 1967 about 0230 CDT. If Fort Churchill was engaged in any type of upper atmospheric experiments on the above two days, the information would be helpful in evaluating UFO cases.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 8 Aug 67

Contact was made with Mr. Karl Hedrow of the Goddard Space Flight Center (ext 4813). Mr. Hedrow said that he did not know for sure the Churchill Churchill would be launching rockets between 26 July and 17 August 1967. He suggested that we contact Mr. N. Hassain at Ft. Churchill for additional information. There was a launch from Ft. Barrow, Alaska 3 Aug 67 at 1210Z.

21 August, 1967.

Colonel James C. Manatt,

Headquarters Foreign Technology Division,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Dear Col. Manatt:

I refer to your letter, TDET/UFO, of the 14 August, 1967.

Two Black Brant VB rockets carried a barium payload for release at altitudes of 150 and 250 miles. The times and dates at which these rockets were released are given below:

(1)    0236 hours 01.08 seconds CDT on 3 August, 1967.
(2)    2303 hours 38.662 seconds CDT on 6 August, 1967.

We, however, did not launch any chemical release rocket on the 27 July, 1967. I trust the above information will be helpful. Please do no hesitate to get in touch with me should you require further information.

Yours truly,

N. Hussain,
Asst. Chief of Operations,
HQ Churchill Research Range.
