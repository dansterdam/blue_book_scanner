34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    11   August   1966
                                                     Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I will not be clear as I'll try to explain here. I was sitting on the step when looked up and saw a very bright star sparkling which seemed to be pulled out a very faint red. I started talking to my friends and when I looked up again I saw a moving object or what seemed to be a star moving across the sky and I informed all who were around me of my sighting and asked them to watch because I had seen it. They acknowledged many times before and no one believed me. They all believed once they saw it themselves and agreed it was not an airplane or anything else. I was experienced seeing before. I was nothing else could cause what I saw. From one side to the other in south east direction until it went over the top and I still do not know if it was an airplane, a star or what. It started and moved because I looked down. From the sky about 10 minutes before I looked up again I saw the moving object. I looked again. The sparkling star pulled the star that went out of sight, but I the stars were that time was in a different position and I never could locate the sparkling star or object I had first seen again.

The text appears to be handwritten in cursive script and is quite dense. However, much of the text is difficult to read clearly due to the handwriting style and image quality. Some words and phrases are legible, but a complete and accurate transcription would require careful examination. At the bottom right of the page, I can make out "Page 8" printed in a small font.

The document appears to be a handwritten report or letter, written in a compact, flowing cursive style that makes comprehensive OCR challenging. Without more advanced handwriting recognition tools, I cannot confidently reproduce the full text.

I find it very hard to try to draw the object because it looked like a star. Now would a star be considered this shape? or on this shape by the naked eye? It was moving with easterly in the sky.
