The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an official Project Blue Book record card. The card contains various fields filled out, including the date, location, type of observation, source, length of observation, and a brief summary of the sighting. The summary describes an object brighter than the moon that was observed for about 30 minutes, described as resembling a parachute. No further details or images are provided in this particular record card.
