UFO Observation, 28 May 1966, Wappingers Falls, New York

4713th Def Sys Eval Sq

1. Reference the unidentified sighting of [redacted] which occurred on 28 May 1966. The attached photograph is forwarded to your office for return to.

2. Analysis of the information which was submitted did not reveal a positive identification. The description, size and lighting configuration is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. There are several air routes in the immediate area, and it is possible that an aircraft could have been observed.

3. The following photo analysis did not provide evidence of the presence of an extraterrestrial vehicle.

a. Examination of the submitted Polaroid-type print indicates that the camera focus-was set for a very short range as evidenced by the high degree of detail in a fragment of a relatively close object in the lower right corner of the photo. It would appear that this object is an indistinct subject in the photograph and that the "UFO" was situated just beyond that range, and immediately in front of a rather highly reflective object (reported as "not visible to observer when taking picture") which shows a reflected image of the "UFO" along its lower edge and a probable reflection of the flash (attachment) as well. The "UFO" appears to be spherical rather than oblong as reported. It also appears to be in motion and there is no suggestion of "panning" the object as is evidence by the sharpness of detail in the foreground object. The identity of the "UFO" is not known but its size is likely to be between that of a "ping-pong" ball and a tennis ball. There is no evidence in the photography that the "UFO" is extraterrestrial.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-55
PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 6 December 1966

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Wappingers Falls, New York    DATE 27 May 1966

AF    1 Polaroid Print (B&W)    QUALITY Poor
P NRS

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request by Major Quintanilla (TDETR) to determine the identity of and the manner in which the object was photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the submitted Polaroid-type print indicates that the camera focus was set for a very short range as evidenced by the high degree of detail in a fragment of a relatively close object in the lower right of the photo. It would appear that this object is an inadvertent subject in the photograph and that the "UFO" was situated just beyond that range, and immediately in front of a rather highly reflective object (reported as "not visible to observer when taking picture") which shows a reflected image of the "UFO" along its lower edge and a probable reflection of the flash (attachment) as well. The "UFO" appears to be in negative of "framing" the object as is evidenced by the sharpness of detail in the foreground. It also appears to be in motion. The size is likely to be between that of a "ping-pong" ball and a tennis ball. There is no evidence in the photography that the "UFO" is extraterrestrial.
