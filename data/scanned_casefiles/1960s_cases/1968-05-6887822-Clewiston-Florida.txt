Dear Sir:

We saw on the night of May the 18, 1968 about 10 o'clock, 7 U.F.O. one after another each about 7 and 1/2 minutes apart. About 7 good ones were seen. It was about 10:30 when the last one was seen, but 30 minutes later a different one appeared. There was one large light at the end of the formation, 7 more were three small ones and one large vehicle. They all looked like a tear drop except one in formation. All of the objects were seen through good telescopes one at 70x the other at 35x. We were taping the whole observation, but for some unknown reason this tape was ruined. After this experience we decided to start a club so we can keep a watch for U.F.O. so we would like some advice from you.

Sincerely Yours
