UFO INVESTIGATION CENTER  
Subject of the file:  
Daytime sighting  
Dear Sirs,  
Dear UFO Investigation Center,  
On 25 September 1965 at approximately 4:35 PM, the witness saw a peculiar, bright object in the sky over Santa Barbara, California. The object was defined as disc-shaped, bright silver in color, and made no noise. It was observed for approximately 101 minutes. The witness is considered reliable and has no history of UFO sightings. At the time 0 minutes elapsed, the object was first observed. At about 101 minutes elapsed, the object disappeared over the horizon. The object emitted no exhaust or contrail during the observation.

Transcribed text from the document:

Chairman of the Site connoissors committee
I must report for the record two certain observations
which led to the immediate removal of further study of the
Santa Barbara encounter by this committee.
1. While it is true that an object was seen, apparently in the air,
toward the coast near Santa Barbara, the size, altitude and
movement of the object were such that several members felt
that thousands of similar objects could easily be mistaken for
birds or other known phenomena of nature.
2. The object in question displayed no visual or electronic
characteristics which would distinguish it from conventional
aircraft or known natural phenomena. The witnesses were
several and varied, but their descriptions were such that no
definitive conclusions could be drawn.
Therefore, I recommend that this case be closed and no
further investigations be undertaken at this time.
Signed
