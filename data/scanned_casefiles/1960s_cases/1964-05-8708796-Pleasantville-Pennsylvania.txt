11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was a brilliant white light in a dark field. The brilliance was like that of a flash bulb and as large as the moon or basketball higher in the sky. Observer caught a glimpse of a yellow-orange gaseous bottom of a ball which seemed streaked with blue. It moved at a high rate of speed. Went out of sight in 1-2 seconds. Disappeared and reappeared again, took after it for about 2 miles down the road. It was very low over a field and clearly defined. It looked like a perfect circle of yellow-orange light and was standing still. Object was approx 25 deg off the ground.

UFOs OVER NW PA. CITY
NICAP INVESTIGATES

A few days later, we obtained a copy of "The Kane Repub-
lican", a newspaper in Kane, Pa. In the issue of October 20th,
it reported sightings in the Titusville, Pa. area. (Credit Louise
Holt.)

We wrote the Titusville Herald and received an answer from
NICAP Investigator William B. Weitzel, who was in the area
making inquiries. He was kind enough to send us thermofax
copies of several cases.

Strange Light Seen At Hilltop Reported ... October 17, 1964
Recent reports of UFOs have brought to light a sighting late
last May in Pleasantville by two borough residents.
Rev. H. Curtis Shaw, pastor of The First Presbyterian Church
in Pleasantville, accompanied by Walter A. MacDonald, reported
seeing a "ball of fire" on May 26 or 27 at about 11 P.M.

The two men had been working at the Presbyterian church
and were pulling out of Mr. MacDonald's driveway after picking
up some equipment, when a large, bright white light, high enough
to be mounted on a pole, appeared on the south side of State
Street.

Object Reappears ... The object was approximately as
bright as a lightning flash and lasted about four seconds, then
disappeared, reappearing on the north side of the street, Mr.
Shaw said.

Mr. Shaw followed the ball, now decreased in intensity to
about the brilliancy of the moon, as it moved west above State
Street. Its color was yellowish at this time, it was reported.

The object traveled west out State Street, coming to a halt
near White City Hill, where it hung suspended for a few minutes,
then appeared to bounce twice. The watchers shut off the car
motor and got out of the vehicle, intending to walk to the top of
the hill where the ball seemed to be stationed.

Dwindles Rapidly ... Suddenly the ball "shot west at a
fantastic speed," dwindling to a small pinpoint almost immediately.
The effect was as if a camera shutter had been tripped and cut
out a large amount of light, he said. Weather conditions at the
time of sighting were reported to be relatively clear, and the
moon could be seen higher in the sky. The object was clearly
defined, and did not seem to have a halo, it was reported.

Rising a little higher, it "shot" west (quite low and with incredible speed, travelling horizontally, and disappeared from sight in about 5 seconds. I drove into Titusville chasing it but it was definitely gone this time.

I didn't talk about this for three months except with [redacted]. Then this fall, the local Titusville Newspaper said they had a picture of a UFO. I went to see it and it looked like a cloud. They said the picture was taken below Oil City on Route 8, I believe. It looked like a cloud to me having no particular shape.

The reporter asked me why I had come in. I told him briefly what I had seen in May. He called a man from NICAP (which I had never heard of) who came over to the news office and talked with me a couple of hours and gave me a copy of "The UFO Evidence."

Not long ago he called me and told me to get a copy of the latest issue of "True Magazine" calling my attention to an article by Major Donald Keyhoe. I got the magazine and read it. When I finished it I decided to write a letter to you.

I would like to know if it is true that the Air Force has a policy of censorship concerning all UFO sightings, as Keyhoe asserts.

Most of all I should like to know what you think these white and orange lights were that we saw. NICAP has not been of much help in explaining them except to say that they are space ships from another planet. If this is possible I should like to know this also. I am sure what we saw was no balloon, plane, or bird unless some type which we do not know of.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
[redacted]

HOS/kp

P.S. One detail I neglected to mention. At no time did either of us hear any sound that could be connected with what we were watching.

Also--I could not say for certain that there was a definite connection between the brilliant light first seen and the clear silver white basketball of light. It would appear that they were the same thing or two of the same. I am more certain the yellow-orange lights were the same as we saw it going west ahead of the car and apparently it stopped in the field between Pleasantville and Titusville. We saw it standing still three times, and in motion two times.

Dear:

Your reported observation on the night of 26 May is indeed interesting and might aid some what confirming to us also. Your letter is being forwarded to Dr. J Allen Hynek, Director of Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University and consultant to the Air Force on this matter. We are unable to offer you any explanation for the series of lights which you have described.

The attached brochure represents the Air Force efforts to date relating to this phenomenon in answer to your specific question regarding unidentified flying objects (UFO). NICAP has no comments with the United States Government. The publication was reviewed by the Air Force and close examination failed to reveal any evidence which would substantiate the maintained flying objects under intelligent control. The changes made, the Air Force withhold information is false and refuted by the publication itself, utilizing Air Force case files as the prime source of the material used.

Within may still articles, the Air Force sent a letter to NASA requesting clarification of our unidentified (G) incident. NASA informed the Air Force that such an incident did not occur, that the objects which were fragments which separated from the booster, and in a successful final stage operation there was no need for NASA to submit a report of any kind. Radar tracked the fragments and the capsule in order to maintain scientific orbital flight information.

Report on telephone conversation with [REDACTED] First United Presbyterian Church, [REDACTED] Street, Pleasant view, Pennsylvania, phone [REDACTED], regarding his observation of 26 May 64, phone call was made on 10 May 65.

GENERAL COMMENTS:

1. Object of phone call was to determine if possible, through the conversation, of general eligibility and exciteability of observer and to attempt to bring out any inconsistancies and contradictions during the retelling of the story.

2. As stated in the original report the sighting was divided into three phases:

Phase One: [REDACTED] and a [REDACTED] phone [REDACTED], were driving west on route 36-27 in fairly open country, when for three or four seconds, they saw a very bright light, so bright, [REDACTED] said over the telephone that they almost had to squint at it. He said he was sure it was close by because it was in front of trees that were on the other side of the field. The [REDACTED], incidentally is a young man, who on 1 Jun 65 is being transferred to another parish. The light in the field suddenly went out.

Phase Two: Shortly after this, apparently just a matter of aminute or so, both men saw a clearly defined light but not so bright as the first light, somewhat higher in the sky, higher than the treetops, to their right, definitely circular outlines, but appeared as a reflective light, somewhat larger than the moon. If this was the original light it must have crossed the road. [REDACTED] said that it might have crossed over the car. [REDACTED] was frightened. This second phase occurred about 1/2 mile West of the original sighting. During the second phase [REDACTED] got out of the car and saw the actual moon elsewhere in the sky. He said the sky was very clear. Object was a clear silver white color. He originally stated the second phase lasted 12-15 seconds but agreed that since in this time he had to stop the car, get out, look around and get back into the car and look out the front window the time must have been longer. Here his story is inconsistant.


- page 7 -

He said it was very close to the car, so close that he had to look at a sharp angle upward through the windshield to see it, he had started up the car again and at this time object apparently took off at a high fantastic rate of speed. In any case he lost sight of it.

Phase Three: He took off West in the car attempting to trail the object. After proceeding two miles, during a part of which journey he was illegally on blocked road that was under repair, he saw the object again. Now it looked like a circle of stationary yellow orange light, he thinks it was about 500 yards away, again they got out and watched for about two minutes. They got into the car once again and proceeded towards the object along dirt road which circles the lot on which the light was either resting or hovering very low. Very shortly thereafter (blacked out text was hazy on exact times and durations) he said the light which now looked like a large setting sun, rose some 25 feet off the field. The he said it rose a little higher and traveled West, horizontally with incredible speed and disappeared within 5 seconds.

2. He said he could have gotten terrific movies of it had he had a camera because the light was so bright. There was no sound, however the light did not give the impression of being attached to anything "just a big ball of light". Sky was almost complete clear with very little wind.

3. (blacked out text) said they had the feeling "they were observing something in another world".

4. MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS RELATIVE TO SIGHTING: The light did not give of beams of light, rather seemed to glow, it went from a dead stop to phenomenal speed. the (blacked out text) said "it seemed like the thing was looking at us". At one time he turned his headlights off because he was afraid of an attack. He said he felt frightened, got very frightened and for five weeks after this when he took the garbage out, etc and looked at the pine trees he had a chilly, erie feeling, sort of expecting the thing to come back. It never did.

5. The only other possible collaboration was a [blacked out], who lives close by who said she saw a bright light in the sky but merely pulled down her sh[blacked out]
(A fine example of scientific curiosity)

6. [blacked out] also indicated that when the light was closed to the car it was lower than the top of a telephone pole and seemed to be swooping down.

7. Unfortunately the [blacked out] was unable to couch anything in scientific terms.
He used vague descriptions and was not precise as to the motions of the light.
He was precise about the roads used and the distances his car traveled. It was clear from the conversation that he had been deeply moved by the experience,
Also, that he didn't want any publicity since he is aware that it would due his reputation any good. He didn't talk about his experience with anyone for several months but finally was inadvertently put in touch with a man from NICAP. This sighting is now, therefore, in the NICAP files.

9. I think it might be worthwhile for me to talk with [blacked out] also.

Dear Mr. Johnson:

I was very happy you were elected and supported you in this area even though we differ over Bible Reading in Public Schools.

Something happened to me in May along with another man who was asked (Thank God he was). This is why I enclose the article on "UFO"s.

Here is a brief summary of what happened May 26, 1964 at about 11 p.m.:

We were driving west on Route 36-27 towards Pleasantville when we saw a brilliant globe or ball white light in a field just off to our left (South). We stopped and looked. It was perhaps 150-200 yards away. Suddenly the light went out. We continued into Pleasantville and saw a silver-white light (about the size of a basketball) above the trees-tops just to the right of us. It was not as intense as the first light. We looked at it. All the windows in the car were down so it could not be a reflection. Suddenly it went out.

I turned and looked out the front window and caught a glimpse of the bottom of a yellow-orange ball going west at fantastic speed. (I had the impression it had swept over the car). The bottom of this yellow-orange ball (or globe) was thick with blue and looked gaseous. I went after it but it was out of sight.

Route 27 was torn up and blocked off but I drove around the road block hoping to see "it" again. We did. It was setting in a field between Pleasantville and Titusville--yellow orange and looked clearly defined (not having the gaseous look it had when in motion). We got out of the car and watched it. It appeared to "hover" for perhaps two minutes. Then it rose up suddenly and shot away from us like a bullet.

It looked to be from 4 to 6 feet in diameter in the field and disappeared from view, going west in a straight line, in about 4-5 seconds.

I should like any information you have about UFO's. I was a complete skeptic until May 26. Also I should like to know if the Air Force does censor all sightings unless they can be explained as Maj. Keyhoe asserts. After reading this article two questions came to mind. 1) Was the "blue"


- page 12 -

Here is the text from the document:

"light" seen by John Glenn when he was orbiting ever explained?: 2) Was there an explanation for Scott Carpenter's radio failure?

Maj. Keyhoe emphasis is upon planes, capsules, and rockets. I assure you what we observed was far lower than any plane capsule or rocket or balloon. I had considered a height (approx.) of the tremendous speed and altitude (to say nothing of the tremendous glowing yellow-orange light) rules it out.

I do not believe that censorship is the answer. If this is some government experiment they are shocking citizens.

Thank you for your attention in this matter.

Kindest regards.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

Dear Sir:

Last May 26 about 11:00 p.m. and I were driving west on Routes 36-27 when we saw a large globe of brilliant white light in a dark field off to our left (south). It was close and either on the field or just off it. Its intensity of brilliance was like that of a flash bulb so its size was difficult to estimate. Suddenly the light disappeared.

Proceeding slowly west we again saw a ball of silver-white light about the size of a large moon or basketball higher in the sky (above the treetops) and stationary. The sky was clear and I stepped out on the road and saw the moon high in the sky in back of us (east). The round light above the treetops looked like a light might look if it was reflected in a mirror. We watched this light with the right front window rolled down. It lasted about 12-15 seconds then went out abruptly. This was about .5 of a mile from the initial bright light in the field west.

As I turned my head and looked out the front window I caught a glimpse of a yellow-orange gaseous bottom of a ball which seemed streaked with blue. It had to be low as I looked out the front window to proceed west on the road. It was moving at a fantastic rate of speed. It got out of sight west of us in 1-2 seconds (unless it went up).

I took after it and had lost sight of it. About two miles down the road (the last section of which was under repair and blocked off) we saw it again. I had gone around the road block traveling west hoping to see it again. It was very low over a field and clearly defined. It looked like a perfect circle of yellow-orange light and was standing still. It was probably 550 yards from us. We got out of the car and watched. It was to the left of the road on the field.

After watching for about two minutes I told I thought we could get closer. About 100 yards there is a dirt road off to the left which circles the field. We got into the car and started for the road. Just as I began to turn off the main roat (Route 27 W) the sphere ascended--perhaps 25 feet off the ground. I immediately stopped the car. (It looked like a large setting sun).
