Major William Coleman and I visited Mrs.
, Virginia on 13 June 1963 to interrogate her further
on the UFO sighting she reported to have occurred on
Both Major Coleman and I talked with her.
As a witness Mr. did not impress me-- Basically
unsure and unreliable not only as to details but as to major
facts. While in no sense a disturbed person; still she appeared
to me more emotional than intellectually critical or observant.
I asked her to go over her original observation. Perhaps
the most significant new item occurred when I asked her to
point simultaneously--one arm to the position of the object; the
other to the position of the sun at that time. The mean of
several repetitions indicated strongly that the angle was between
20 and 30 degrees and, hence, that the phenomenon she saw might
have been a sun dog. She stated that during the hour's observation, the object did not move relative to the sun which statement
was contrary to her original testimony. She also stated that
when a cloud passed over the object, the object turned reddish
at the edges.
In view of the above scanty and generally uncritical observations, it seems entirely possible that Mrs. had
observed a typical sun dog.

Dr. J. A. Hynek

Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The enclosed slides were taken on May 11th between
2 and 2:30 PM, EDST, with a Leica M3, Summaron F 3.5 5 cm
wide angle lens, at f16 and f22 apertures.

You will notice that slides 3,4,5 and 7 show disc
shaped sun reflections. These appear only where the
sun was framed deliberately in the viewfinder. Possibly
the same effect was produced by my own lenses, which
are corrected for my extreme near-sightedness. My sun
glasses are stronger than the others. And, of course,
there may be no relationship.

Since we discussed sources of reflection, I do want to
remind you again that we have a small pond at the foot
of our property which was clear because of the dry
weather we were experiencing.

I hope the slides will be helpful to you.

Sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]
