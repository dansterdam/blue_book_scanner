Major William Coleman and I visited Mrs. ______ in Virginia on 13 June 1963 to interrogate her on the UFO sighting she had reported to have occurred on Both Major Coleman and I talked with her.

As a witness, Mrs. ______ did not impress me as unsure and unreliable in her facts. While in no sense a disturbed person, still she seemed to me more emotional than intellectually critical or objective. I asked her to go over her original observation: the most significant new item occurred when I asked her point simultaneously--one arm to the position of the object relative to the position of the sun at that time. The mean of several repetitions indicated strongly that the angle was 20 and 30 degrees and, hence, that the phenomenon she saw have been a sun dog. She stated that during the observation, the object did not move relative to the sun which was contrary to her original testimony. She also stated that when a cloud passed over the object, the object turned red, at the edges.

In view of the above scanty and generally uncritical variations, it seems entirely possible that Mrs. ______ observed a typical sun dog.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page of a letter from Edward J. Linehan to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the Director of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, dated May 21, 1963.

The text of the letter is as follows:

EDWARD J. LINEHAN
BOX 244, ROUTE 3
LORTON, VIRGINIA

May 21, 1963

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Director, Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The enclosed slides were taken on May 11th between 2 and 2:30 PM, EDST, with a Leica M3, Summaron F 3.5 cm wide angle lens at f/16 and 1/250 sec. apertures.

You will notice that slides 3,4,5 and 7 show disc shaped sun reflections. These appear only where the sun was framed deliberately in the viewfinder. Possibly the same effect was produced by my own lenses, which are corrected for my extreme near-sightness. My sun glasses are stronger than the others. And, of course, there may be no relationship since we discussed sources of reflection. I do want to remind you again that we have a small pond at the foot of our property which was clear because of the dry weather we were experiencing.

I hope the slides will be helpful to you.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
