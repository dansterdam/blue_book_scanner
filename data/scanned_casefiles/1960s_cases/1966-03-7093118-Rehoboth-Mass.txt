UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)                SHEET 3

An interesting and perhaps significant fact uncovered by this agent was that there is a large concentration of high tension electrical power coming into a sub-station in the area of the UFO sighting.

Submitted by,
Ernest G. Reid
Investigator: NICAP MASS SUBCOM

After receiving the above report and completed signed NICAP UFO data questionnaires the Chairman contacted Marilyn Greene (Ref: Group 2) and Mr. Joseph Woitoza by telephone (Ref: Group 3) and interviewed them. A summary of the combined sighting accounts is below based upon my analysis of the data submitted to me by Investigator Reid.

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS
Group #1

Group I were driving West on Cedar Street, Rehoboth at approximately 8:20 PM when Miss Letourneau called the group's attention to a 2 Year bright pulsating amber-colored lights seemingly revolving in a horizontal position around an unusual object. They were moving slowly from North to South. The lights maintained the same relationship to each other and indicating that "there were attached to the object" but "which object could not be seen behind the brightest of the lights." The low-flying lights passed over the road ahead of them at an undetermined distance seemingly just clearing telephone poles. It then stopped and hovered for several minutes just off Cedar Chase Road. Then it began moving in a slow descent Southwestward toward a wooded area. Just before it reached the top of a clump of trees about 1/2 - 1 mile away from the observer, the lights moved slowly from a horizontal to a vertical position, brightened, then dimmed and went out completely. It gave Group 1 the impression that the object landed behind the trees.

Immediately after the observation, Miss Letourneau was at least as wide as the distance between the lights, its apparent size was compared to the size of a fragment "held at arm's length". Total sighting time was an estimated 5 - 10 minutes. The object was viewed through the car windows. No one noticed stars, moon or known aircraft in the sky. Group 1 immediately drove to the Swansea Police Department to report the UFO. Trooper Joseph Procaccini stated that the youngsters appeared to be quite sincere. Trooper Procaccini headed said that he believed the object was of some "type". He did not think the incident was a hoax because of the youth's sincerity and their efforts in contacting the Swansea Police and then returning to notify the State Police.

A USAF Investigator questioned all of Group 1 via telephone with the exception of Miss Mooney. USAF Captain Paul McManus, USAF FAO told the press that a group of USAF Intelligance specialists could investigate the sighting. "It is significant" that the UFO was reported in the vicinity of electrical high power lines which were just behind the witnesses.

UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/65)                                SHEET 4

Many UFO sightings being received have occurred in the vicinity of power lines and power stations.

Group # 2

Group 2 were returning from choir practice and "driving south" along Route #113 in Rehoboth between 8:00 - 8:30 PM. They were on "the way to Warren, Rhode Island". As they rounded a bend in the road they sighted a group of very bright lights hovering almost over the road just ahead of them. "Their altitude was estimated to be about 500 Feet and when first sighted seemed to be about 1000 yards from their car." As they began to close at 35-40 mph within 500 - 600 yards of the object, it suddenly winged at a rapid speed instantly from a complete standstill and moved Southwestward disappearing behind trees.

All witnesses described the UFO as two very large brightly glowing red-orange lights with a faint smaller red light just below them and in the middle. Mrs. Rose who "had the best vantage point distinctly saw a very dim metallic reflection between the lights which outlined an oval or circular object. The lights seemed to bear the bottom of the object." Mr. Borden stated that the two large lights were about 3 road yards apart or "about 50-100 feet apart" if less estimation of distance was correct. The lights were not pulsating or revolving and always maintained the same relative position to each other. As the object sped away, it was low enough to show tree tops in front of it which were about 600 yards away. Assuming that the object was at least as wide as the distance between the 2 lights, size was compared to the size of a large melon held at arm's length by Mrs. Bear and to that of an orange by Mr. Borden and Mrs. Bear. The brightness was larger in size at the same distance. Bars and headlights but larger in size at the bright T.V. tower light would be at the same distance. They were so bright that "they gave a blurred effect". Total viewing time was 2 - 3 minutes. The object was viewed through car windows and windshield. The area was very dark with no stars or moon noticed. No sound was heard.

From land's view, Mr. Joseph Mottoza, Rehoboth Police, Rehoboth, Oscar A.B. Bergman.

Group # 3

Mr. Joseph Mottoza, Postmaster of Rehoboth, was watching TV about 10:00 pm. He is not very certain of the exact time. He was called outside and saw 2 bright round red lights pulsating. He thought he saw a fainter steady red light located back and to the right of these 2 and in the middle. Also but was not sure. He emphasized that the 2 larger lights were extremely bright. He called another witness to corroborate his sighting. Automobile headlights and streetlights from a block away. Although the lights maintained the same relative position to each other indicating that they were part of an unseen object. The 2 following sightings were in a horizontal plane. Assuming that the width of the object was at least the distance between the 2 lights, he estimated that the object itself would be "apparent size of 2 of a quarter at arm's length." "I told him..."

full moon and he stated that it would have been much larger than the disc of the full moon.)

He estimated that the UFO was about 1/4 mile away when he saw it from his backyard AND STATED THAT IT MADE A STRANGE WHISTLING OR LUMINOUS SOUND. The object was moving on a North to South course and was swung around in a broad arc into the Southwest disappearing behind a hill 1 1/4 miles away. Total observing time about 3 minutes. He assured me that he was familiar with airplanes and helicopters and that this object was neither. W. Moitoso told me that he did not report his sighting to any of officials, but happened to mention it as the post office in defense of the jokes that were going around the four teenagers who saw a flying saucer. Apparently, someone reported his statement to the press and his sighting became publicized.

EVALUATION:

It is quite apparent that all three groups of witnesses sighted the same or similar object within a radius of several miles. Each group was entirely independent or and unaware of the each other. The characteristic bright red pulsating red lights, oval configuration, ability to hover and dark easy flow a standstill and the humming or whistling sound are all common characteristics of no true UFO. This particular sighting is very similar to the Exeter R.I. UFO sighting of 9-3-65 which involved a dark cylindrical-shaped object with pulsating bright red lights reported in the vicinity of high power lines.

I know of no natural phenomena that would account for this sighting. The unusual characteristics coupled with the absence of conventional aircraft's identification lights, plus the evaluation is to that the object sighted definitely falls into the category of an unknown object. In attempting will be made to obtain further information on this sighting, including a detailed map plotting of the object's flight path against times and places. Such information will be included in a future addendum to this report.

The observers were close to the Hillsgrove R.I. Airport and in a direct line to the approach of the airport. There was heavy aircraft traffic in the area at that time.

ADDENDUM I

Questioned by U.S. Officials

Rehoboth Residents
See Flying Objects
At least a dozen Rehoboth
residents, including the town's
Police Chief Oscar A. B. Bergh,
Investigator from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
member of the National Scientific Committee on Aerial Phenomena, a private research organization, have questioned at least
two of the witnesses.

The sightings have been
made last Wednesday from 7
p.m. and 10 p.m.

Typically of the sightings each
time the objects were described as three reddish lights in
plain view, however more details were not available.

At least one of the witnesses
reported the objects as part of a large, circular object.

Witnesses have been within
three miles of each other in Rehoboth when the sightings have
been made.

Hearing him was Joseph
Motless, Rehoboth resident,
who said both he and his wife
were at their home on Cedar
Street. The lights moved from east to the southwest by west.

Mr. Motless said both he and
his wife saw a sound of a loud humming noise. He said the lights were stationary at first, Mr. Motless said he did not report his sighting to police.

Another sighting last Wednesday was reported by Gardner
Barden of 122 Bay State Road.

He said he was driving to
Ward Warren along Route 118
when he and three residents
with him saw three reddish
lights.

In about three minutes, Mr.
Barden said, the lights disappeared behind some trees.

"When we first saw the
lights," he said, "they were
about 500 yards in front of us
and about 100 feet high. The
color and brilliance of the lights
were unusual.

"At first we thought it was a
helicopter," Mr. Barden continued. "But after we watched it
and disappeared the lights sped up to about 10 times their original size
and disappeared behind some trees."

One of the passengers, Mrs.
Warren Frates, who was with Mr.
Barden, said the lights seemed to
be "like headlights."

"We saw three very large
headlights high above the ground," she said. "We stopped, and looked like large headlights."

She said the lights "appeared
to be on the bottom of a large
object" and that Mr. Barden
accompanied the lights, she said.

"We weren't frightened, and
we didn't jump to any conclusions," Mrs. Frates said. "I'm just
as skeptical of flying saucers as
anyone."

Both Mr. Barden and Mrs.
Frates said they were questioned
by representatives of the National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

A third sighting was reported
about 7 p.m. on March 23 by
Mrs. June Palmer of Peirsville
Road, who said she and her
children watched for about 20
minutes from their home as
three lights moved slowly across
the sky.

"They were very close to
each other, and seemed to be
about 500 feet above her
house," Mrs. Palmer said. "Afterward a while one of the lights
separated slowly from the others and drifted off in another
direction."

She said she saw a flashing
light that between two red
lights. There was no noise, she
said.

Mrs. Palmer said two of her
friends also saw the lights, but
she said they remained silent,
feeling reticule.

Otis Intelligence Probes
Strange Aerial Lights
The Intelligence Division at
the Otis Air Force Base has been
assigned to investigate the
strange aerial lights seen in the
area teen-agers of strange aerial
lights at the Rehoboth-Dighton
line last night.

Capt. Paul McManus, public
information officer, said that
the report made at the Rehoboth State Police Barracks concerning hovering lights was the
first in this area.

He said that a team
of intelligence specialists will be
dispatched to the area and a report of their findings will be
made.

The foursome said that while
riding in an auto on Cedar
Street in Rehoboth they noticed
two amber-colored lights flashing above their car.

One of the group, Jacqueline Letoumeau, 19, of Sill Glade St.
said the group watched the
lights flashing like "a hovering light."

She said that the shape was
not distinguishable.

Miss Letoumeau said that the
amber-colored lights moved to a field and appeared to be landing in a clump of trees. Down
the lights began to converge
and move in a vertical position and appeared

Others in the auto sighting
the lights were Ernest Nunes,
17, of 24 New Hampshire Ave.,
Somerset; Guy Bettencourt, 633 County St., Somerset; and
Mary L. Mooney, 19, of 28 Brayton Ave., this city.

Miss Letoumeau said the
group was traveling toward a
report the sighting to the Swansea police. They were directed
to the Otis Air Force Base to
state police in Rehoboth.

Capt. McManus said at the
initial at the Rehoboth barracks
said the youngsters appeared to
be "very level headed" and
said that he believes they did
see something unusual.

A trooper was dispatched to
the general area but nothing
was sighted.

Procedural said he didn't
think the incident was a hoax
because of the youths' efforts
in contacting the Swansea police and returning to notify the
state police.

The police were no other reports of sightings either to the state
police or to the town police.
There was a description at least
a couple of hours involved.

UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)                                SHEET 2

SIGHTING BACKGROUND:

News of the sighting reached the Chairman via press service teletype message #DELI44453/31. I contacted Subcommittee member Ernest C. Reid to investigate. The following report was submitted to my Investigator Reid along with signed data sheets from most of the witnesses:

This agent arrived at the Rehoboth Massachusetts State Police barracks on 3-2-66 at 4:15 PM and was told Trooper who had taken the report was not on duty this day. When I asked to see the report that was made, I was shown the teletype that was sent to the State Police Headquarters in Boston. I took a photostatic of this report with permission of the trooper on duty. The original report was taken by Trooper Joseph M. Fraccacini on 3-30-66 at about 8:40 PM.

The four young people were sent to the State Police by police in Swansea (no further details given) who told them that they were not interested in talking a report on UFOs.

I then proceeded to Rehoboth Police Headquarters and contrary to earlier press and Air Force statements found that additional sightings were reported and recorded in the Rehoboth Police logs. Three additional "sightings" were made about 8:15 PM and the description of the two radio given by the four young people. An investigation by this agent revealed that the four young people and four other persons were each asked what the UFO did not know each other nor did they know of each others' reports at this time.

This agent visited two of the persons who reported their sightings to the Rehoboth police and because of a time problem was unable to get a written report. However, these people did take form and commissioned to send them to possible: (Ref: Mr. and Mrs. Gardner Borden, Group 2). They stated that they were at a church choir practice with some friends (Ref: Group 2) when they saw the/UFO. Arriving at the Borden residence was 5:00 PM.

At 6:00 PM I interviewed the four young people. (Ref: Group 1) They appeared to be very relaxed and answered the NICAP questionnaire forms. There was some minor disagreements as will be noted on the question forms. All but Larry Mooney said that they had been contacted by police, but Larry Mooney said that they had been contacted by police but did not make any appointment to see them.

I made a radiological survey throughout the area where the four young people were. With one exception, there was no unusual reading recorded and there was no disturbance of the ground except broken branches. There was no evidence indicating that an object had landed in this area.
