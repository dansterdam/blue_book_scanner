The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a silhouette or outline of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text accompanying the image mentions that the writer called the Washington Post Newspaper and reported a "flying saucer", but all they received was a recording saying how many "objects (manmade) were in the sky, etc.". The writer has enclosed two diagrams showing the "approximation of the location of both saucers (or whatever they were)..." and states "Hope it is helpful!"

Gentlemen:

I called-up the Washington Post Newspaper, a few evenings ago, and reported a flying saucer......... The reporter told me to call y'all, but all I received was a recording (most delightful!...didn't know it existed!) saying how many objects (manmade) were in the sky, etc.... 

Well, anyhow..., anyhow, here's the scoop...

Enclosed are two diagrams showing the approximation of the location of both saucers (or whatever they were)......

Hope it is helpful!

The image appears to be a hand-drawn schematic or diagram of some kind of UFO or unidentified flying object. It contains various annotations and labels, including "Flying saucer", "radar tower", and "To Woodward station?". There is also a reference to "J.C. Penny" and some additional handwritten notes and sketches. However, the image does not contain any human faces or identifiable individuals.

Here is the text that can be extracted from the document:

Flying saucer
Saucer
Tapped Wire
Radar tower
Perfect landing
round star with aimmovement
J.C. Penny
To Woodward station?

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a hand-drawn diagram or sketch. The diagram appears to be some kind of technical or schematic drawing, with various annotations and labels such as "Key:", "saucers", "Descend g", "would not be visible x-raved [sic] for US capt visible", and other text.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a questionnaire or form with various questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared while being observed, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and descriptions of its sound and color. The respondent has provided handwritten answers to these questions. The image also includes a hand-drawn sketch or diagram illustrating the object's movement and direction.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, gradually faded away and became obscured.

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes, No, Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what:
Moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes, No, Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:
Moved out from behind a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Steady, no sound.
b. Color: Bright white, appeared very large.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1966 - Diameter of object about 3/4 of inch at arms length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The text output is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with handwritten text that appears to be a response to a questionnaire.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8-66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

A deliberate inability to make sure that as I never my memory over and over again that is to my being all into the deceptive criteria is to the best of my knowledge, the truth so step me God!
