    Day         Month     Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

While the object appeared to be a star - I am certain it was no ordinary star because of its strange direction of movement.

Also I am sure it was not a shooting star. It moved across the sky at different speeds (seeming to go faster at times than others) and then disappeared while still in full view - it didn't go out of our sight - or fade away into the distance.

It seemed to be standing still when we first saw it!
