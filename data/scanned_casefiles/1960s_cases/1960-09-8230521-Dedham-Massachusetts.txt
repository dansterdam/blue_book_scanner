Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
2 min

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
NNE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
White, star-like object about size of Polaris.
In approx 2 min it moved from zenith to about
35°, then became invisible in general brightness
of Boston. From zenith the object moved at
constant speed to NNE, passing to E of Polaris,
for nearly as bright as Echo and moved several
times faster.

11. COMMENTS
Witnesses are located on SW edge of
Boston. Possible that object observed
was one of the many a/c flying in area
most of the time, but there is insufficient data to make a valid conclusion.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation

                                   (Give Time Standard and minutes or sec)

* Accuracy of time given above:
                                   ± 2 minutes

* Brightness (compared to stars, planets, moon or other useful standard source such as a naked light at a certain distance):
   About same as Venus on this night (very clear, moonless night)

* Direction in which object was first seen:
   (N), N, or NE, or NNW, etc.)

   Almost directly overhead

* Length of time object was seen:
   About 2 minutes

* Apparent direction in which object travelled:
   (N.S., E-W, N.E., S.W., etc.)
   NNE

* Did it change direction?
   No

General impression of angular speed:
(Algonquin, fast, average, slow)
   In the approx. 2 min. of observation, 20 moved from zenith to about
   45°, then 20 became smaller in the general brightness about horizon
   (just like a star, say "star-like")
   Slow like

Color
White

Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish?
No

Any tall or small?
No

Did any sound accompany the object?
No

If sound followed later, give time interval:
-

Was it examined with binoculars or telescopes or photographed?
No

Give position of trajectory for at least two points with regard to stars if possible:
Now gently, the object moved at constant speed for the NNE, passing the 2nd Mag of Bootes.

Any other remarks: My daughter was out, and I, but him outside for some time. I chose the point of ECHO satellite on the 3rd or 4th day after Bootes gave us started to look 2h home (about 8:15 P.M.) when my daughter noticed the object of this moving cloud. We were watching, and we could see it move several times faster.
