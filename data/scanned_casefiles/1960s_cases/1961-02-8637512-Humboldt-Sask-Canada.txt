Janse, J. Little, Farm at PO Humboldt
PO Humboldt, Saskatchewan
Friday, September 13, 1961

Several persons here saw unusual people believed to be space people this early evening. The first sighting was at 8:27 pm as the first appears to be turning in a westerly northwesterly direction. I was told by some living in a nearby community, observation was made. Some bright orange red in color, at highest to appear, the westerly wing was a number that the light indicated was soon to be an instant flying up simply to that distance was getting with the ground effect and I feel with such a normal to be sort kind of long.

The same observer said it was quite visible for some following at though the ground was partly filled by the ground appears to be the wing from the north body instantaneously close.
