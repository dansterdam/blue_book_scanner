10. Location of any air traffic in the area at time of sighting: None.

11. Position title and comments of the mapping officer, including his
preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting:

Executive Officer, Utility Squadron EIGHT. There is no reasonable
explanation of this target. Its speed, acceleration, ceiling and ability to
decelerate exceed any aircraft I have ever seen or heard of. The ship
conducting the exercise, the USS GYATT held track and has supporting data
on this contact and first warned me of its presence and kept me advised of its
re-appearance. Communications were very poor (HF at 230 miles). I would
evaluate target as a direct, very high performance, maneuvered as an aircraft
and performed no unusual maneuvers except, extreme acceleration and de-
celeration at will, plus a very steep climb angle in excess of 50,000 feet at
high speed. No lights on board except what looked like after burner light
(single source) during acceleration.

DETAILED EVENTS OF THE EVENING OF 19 NOVEMBER 1964

On the evening of 19 November 1964 while conducting project operations on board the USS GYATT in Latitude 20° 41.5 North 68° 34' West, the following sequence of events were noted by crew members of the USS GYATT (DD 712) and Norfolk Test and Evaluation Detachment personnel.

The radar used was the SPS-49 Radar, operating in the 850 - 942 mc range, manufactured by the Raytheon Co., Wayland, Massachusetts. The type video shown is Moving Target Resolver (MTR). The pictures were taken with the Universal Shipboard Radarscope Recorder, manufactured by the Heavy Military Electronics Department, General Electric Co., Syracuse, New York. The range of the video shown is 225 miles from GYATT with the range rings about forty-five miles apart.

The Naval aircraft involved was "SALT SPRAY 26", an F-8C aircraft of Utility Squadron EIGHT, based at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. This aircraft was flying at an altitude of thirty thousand feet from the commencement of the scheduled exercise at 2020Q until approximately 2101Q at which time "SALT SPRAY 26" reported a stranger closing very fast. At time 2102Q, "SALT SPRAY 26" by our record increased his altitude to 40,000 feet in an attempt to identify the object. While our records do not show it, due to poor communications, it is believed that "SALT SPRAY 26" climbed to 50,000 feet at some time later. At 2130Q "SALT SPRAY 26" reported still having some object on his port side but our photographs do not show it. "SALT SPRAY 26" was steered for Roosevelt Roads at 2134Q.

In the accompanying photographs, "SALT SPRAY 26" is identified by the letter "A" and what is believed to be the other object is identified by the letter "B". This identification was arrived at by commencing with the merged plot (No. 0751) and tracking backward in time.

At approximately 2110Q, the SPS-49 was jammed for a short period as shown in pictures 0758 to 0760. The source of the jamming is unknown.

The approximate range and bearing from GYATT to "SALT SPRAY 26" for applicable pictures is listed in the accompanying sheet.

The text I can discern in this image includes:

Numerical values around the circular diagram:
250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240

There is a circular diagram with concentric rings and markings, and a smaller circular stamp or seal in the top right corner. There is also a white rectangular area in the top left of the image. However, the text within these areas is not clearly legible to me.
