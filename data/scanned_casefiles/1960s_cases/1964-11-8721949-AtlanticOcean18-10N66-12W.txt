The image appears to be a photograph or a reproduction of a radar screen display. It shows concentric circular patterns and a small object in the center, which could potentially be interpreted as a UFO sighting. However, without further context, I cannot make any definitive claims about the nature or origin of the object.

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE: 8 NOVEMBER 1964
LOCATION: ATLANTIC OCEAN, 18-10N 66-12W
OBSERVER: AIRCRAFT COMMANDER, USAF C-135 AIRCRAFT

SYNOPSIS: WHILE FLYING AT 25,000 FEET, THE AIRCRAFT COMMANDER OBSERVED A RADAR RETURN ON THE AIRCRAFT'S RADAR SCOPE. THE RETURN APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 1,000 KNOTS. WHEN OBSERVED VISUALLY, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND EMITTING A BRIGHT, BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES, THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM BOTH RADAR AND VISUAL OBSERVATION.

CONCLUSION: THE OBJECT REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED. DESPITE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR OTHER OBJECT CAN BE CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THE RADAR AND VISUAL OBSERVATIONS.

- page 19 -

The image appears to contain a radar or sonar-like display, showing various concentric circles and markings. There is a central circular area that appears to represent a geographical map or area. However, there is no photograph present in this particular image.

Transcribing the text from the document:

CONFIDENTIAL
Narrative:
At 1810Z, 8 November 1964, a UFO was observed on radar at 18-10N, 066-12W in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 200 miles east of Puerto Rico. The target appeared on radar for approximately 30 minutes, then faded from the scope. The target displayed characteristics typical of an unidentified submerged or surface object. No visual sightings were made. This report has been filed with Project Blue Book.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a list of items in a table of contents for a report, including:

The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten text which states "This case includes eighteen (18) 7" photographs."

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

This case includes eighteen (18) 7" photographs.

The image contains a photograph depicting a "SALT SPRAY 26" aircraft, which is described in the text. The text indicates that this aircraft was involved in an incident on 19 November 1964 while conducting operations on board the USS GYATT in the Atlantic Ocean. The text provides details about the radar used, the video recording of the event, and the jamming of the SPS-49 radar. There are also some redacted portions in the text.

DETAILED EVENTS OF THE EVENING OF 19 NOVEMBER 1964 WHILE CONDUCTING OPERATIONS ON BOARD THE USS GYATT IN LATITUDE 30°41.5' NORTH 66°38' WEST.

The radar used was the SPS-49 Radar, operating in the 350 me range, manufactured by the ITT Thompson Co., Wayne, N.J. Videotapes were taken with the Universal Shipboard Radarkope Recorder secured to the Heavy Military Intercontinental Departments, Geneseo Corp., Syracuse, New York. The range of the video shows is approximately 25 miles.

The Naval aircraft involved was "SALT SPRAY 26", an F-8H aircraft from squadron RESIGHT, Puerto Rico. This aircraft was flying at an altitude of thirty thousand feet, when it encountered the SPS-49 and began making a run on the USS GYATT. At time 2120Q, "SALT SPRAY 26" made a final pass closer our ship, at which time our ship's ordnance increased his altitude to 6,000 feet in an attempt to maintain communications. It is believed that "SALT SPRAY 26" could have had some object on his port side but our photographs do not show anything.

At approximately 2110Q, the SPS-49 was jammed for a short period of time by the jamming equipment of unknown source of the jamming is unknown.

The approximate range and bearing from GYATT to "SALT SPRAY 26" for applicable pictures is listed in the accompanying sheet.
