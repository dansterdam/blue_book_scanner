The image appears to be a very faint or poorly scanned document page. Most of the text is illegible or not visible in this scan. There are some very faint dots and lines, but no clear, readable text can be discerned from this image.


- page 3 -

The only text visible on this page is:

UNCLAS EFTO

(which appears to be a marking indicating the document is "Unclassified" and possibly an abbreviation or code "EFTO")

The rest of the page appears to be blank or very faintly marked.
