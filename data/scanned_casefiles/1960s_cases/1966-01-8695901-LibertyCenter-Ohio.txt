11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer saw a huge orange light about the size of a moon about a quarter of a mile away. It looked as though in wood, were on fire. It seemed to be 20-30 feet off the ground.

Observers mind could have been shaped by recent magazine article on UFOs.

Dear Major:

I hope you can help me put our minds at ease. It is about the 9:50 Co.

I got up from bed about 2:00 P.M. and glanced out the window. Across the wind about 1/2 mile I saw this large orange light in the woods about the size of a moon. I thought the wood was on fire. I woke my husband, told him to call the fire department. He looked but said would not see anything. Other lights were noticed from 5-10 minutes. It was about 20-30 ft. off...

Here is the OCR text from the document:

the ground. It went up a little ways up + then come back down. It move little ball. The ground: It did not go up very high. It was possible to get smaller and then something a mile to it some completely out of sight. I believe and we flew were reported for that area.

Come upon please give us some explanation as to what it might of been!

Thank you,

P.S. We saw the article in a Popular Science magazine
"Are you Up-to-date on 31906?" The picture shown looks like a pretty white sun. (Taken 1966 Jan)
