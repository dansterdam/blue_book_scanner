There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document containing text related to a UFO sighting report.

The text in the document is as follows:

Feb. 25, 1966
Liberty Center, Ohio
Case #: 6-92-59

WITNESS: CLARENCE MILLER

While Marion Dittman and I were talking outside the house, we saw a strange object in the sky. It was about the size of a dime, appeared to be cigar-shaped and of a silver color. It moved very quickly in an up-and-down motion. We observed it for about 5 to 7 minutes. It would disappear and reappear. it moved higher and we lost sight of it in the overcast. We had not heard of any aircraft being in the area. I've observed many aircraft and have never seen anything like this object. It did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft. The object seemed to be intelligently controlled. This was a definite unidentified flying object.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document reads:

"The probable location of a space vehicle or aircraft has been determined to be near the aircraft and the grass field by the owner of the field and occupant of the house. The space vehicle or aircraft was not visible and left no mark on the ground. There were no sound effects nor visible action observed by the witness. 

Even upon close examination no evidence of residue or scrap could be found.
