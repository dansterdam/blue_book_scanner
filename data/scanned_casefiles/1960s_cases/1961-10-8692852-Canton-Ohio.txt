No Case (Information Only)                                                late October 1961
                                                                                    Fall River Mills, California

The most interesting sighting occurred in late October, in Fall River Mills, Calif. at dusk, a man and his wife saw a hovering oval-shaped object that seemed to be divided into three areas of flashing lights. It was seen to release two smaller objects, also oval and with the same light formations. These smaller UFOs each took off on its own and returned to the "mother ship" about an hour later.

Fully the larger object started at great speed. The same drama was watched on a different night by the same couple, and by two other people who made an independent report. (Researchers interested in more details should write for the Oct. 26th issue of the Fall River Mills, Calif. Inter Mountain News.)

"MOTHER SHIP" SIGHTING IN CALIFORNIA USING "News Briefs," on Page 16 of our last issue, we summarized an unusually interesting report from the Fall River Mills, California "Inter Mountain News" lack of space prevented us from printing more details at that time. In answer to several requests, we quote from the "Inter Mountain News" of October 25th, 1951:

Three separate sightings have been reported on unidentified flying objects over the Fall River Valley last week. The first two were seen at 7:00 and 7:05 p.m. Wednesday, October 10th. A McArthur man and his wife saw the first object, apparently can also be seen over Goble Mountain near Fall River Mills. It was dusk when they first saw the hovering, oval-shaped object against the horizon, as mid it seemed to be divided into three areas of flashing lights. The bottom area was green, the middle area, red, and the top, green. The saucer-shaped object hovered over Goble Mountain as the couple watched it for three hours. It released two other objects, also oval with the same light formations.

"The first small oval departed from the mother ship" about an hour after the big craft was first seen. It went toward the Fall River Valley and returned about an hour later. As it returned the larger ship, in a second object was released from the opposite side. This object headed towards Hat Creek and also returned in an hour and entered the larger craft. At this time the sky overhead toward Hat Creek was great speed.

"The same McArthur couple saw the whole drama re-enacted Sunday night at 7:05, also over Goble Mountain.

In Fall River Mills, on October 18th, two 11-year-old boys, Bennie Bell and Randy Bassett, were in front of the Roy Bassett home, and (they) reported that they saw a strange round object at 7:00 p.m. It stayed in view for several minutes, moving just above the ground, and then moved away with a white light, also several objects from other side.

So, heads up, everybody! (This) sounds like spotlighters from Outer Space to us!...

A spectacular flying saucer hovered near the Smithsonian satellite-observing station in Curaçao, British West Indies, on the night of October 17, 1961. The station crew observed it with binoculars, by apogee telescope, and photographed it with the Bake-Nunn satellite camera. A brilliantly glowing object, it shone in the eastern sky, moving erratically and fluctuating in brightness. After watching it for nearly an hour and finding that the nearby airport could not observe the object, the observers concluded that it must be less distant than it seemed, and set out by car to try to get a closer look.

About a mile and a half from the station they stopped, and solved the mystery. A plantation manager and his servant stood in a field, hanging onto one end of a 1200-foot kite string. At the other end, high in the sky, soared a kite; hanging from it was a lighted pressure lantern [14].

Another frightening UFO encounter---
a 30-mile chase---was reported by Mr. and Mrs. Richard DuBois, 13481 Shirley Street, Westminster, Calif. On the night of Oct. 21, traveling from a weekend, they were driving along Route 60 in New Mexico. Except for their car, the highway was deserted. It was about 2 a.m.

When "brilliant ball of white light" first appeared, they thought it was a meteor. Then turned back and followed alongside. "At first, I thought it was an airplane making an emergency landing," said Mrs. DuBois. But the strange "ball" streaked back into the sky. DuBois' conjecture that it might be an odd moon-light reflection was quickly disproved.

For the bright object again flashed down, raced ahead of the car, then slowed to let them catch up.

"We were really frightened by this time," Mrs. DuBois reported. And their alarm increased when the strange device pacing them suddenly separated into four smaller, glowing objects. Flying alongside, the formation kept pace with the car until a serious strain appeared ahead. When DuBois slowed down, the four UFOs flashed upward and were out of sight.

"We were so terrified," said Mrs. DuBois, "that my husband drove at 100 miles an hour to the next town. We asked if there had been any reports of flying objects. But people only laughed. They thought it was funny, but we were plenty scared."

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Air Force BLUE BOOK July 1963

[The text appears to be a narrative account, but the first few lines are partially cut off. The document seems to be a report about an incident involving Mr. and Mrs. Richard DuBois of Westminster, Col. The text describes some kind of encounter or sighting, with details about a car, moonlight, and a strange behavior involving a vehicle.]

Some key legible sections include:

"Mr. and Mrs. Richard DuBois of Westminster, Col."

"For more than 30 miles between the town of Burl and the town near the police car was accompanied..."

The document appears to be a detailed account of some kind of unusual event or sighting, but without the full context of the first few lines, it's difficult to determine the precise nature of the incident.

The text continues with descriptions of a car, moonlight, and some kind of movement or observation, but the full details are not completely clear from this scan.

                                                                                    Derry, Pen sylvania

Oct. 30: Derry, Pa.--Four apparently
controlled disc-shaped objects were
sighted by Carl H. Gear, Jr. Mr.
Gear, an engineer, was formerly with
the Army Counter-Intelligence Corps.
In a signed report to NICAP, he stated:

"The objects appeared to be luminous
discs with a band of lights or sorts
on outer periphery. Lights varied in hue
from red to yellow to blue. Objects appeared to oscillate with a side-wise
motion, perpendicular to direction of
travel. When objects reached a hill, they
seemed to explode in a brilliant blue
flash." NICAP. Evidently this was an
illusion, as all four objects later appeared intact, "intensely of glow about
five times brighter than the planet Jupiter."

Gear jumped in his car and pursued
the UFCs, which were moving slowly,
and placed them on a parallel road. The
objects finally disappeared behind a
mountain. Gear also stated that the
UFCs traveled in a slightly ascending
course, the glow increasing in intensity.
They traveled in a straightline for-
mation below a sporadic cloud cover.
