PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 18 Apr 64
2. LOCATION: Manassas, Virginia 
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 1930
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: No
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-8 Minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: three/one
9. COURSE: Rising Nw
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Sighting at dusk through Ex. Obj. appeared to be three stars together forming a triangle. Motion erratic. POSSIBLE Appeared to be breaking up. like a red spark that burned out. Looked as bright as meteor at first, while Obj. was observed in flight in the EBE on the horizon and rising. Disappearance at 45 deg elevation.
11. COMMENTS: Wind direction at alt. wrong for balloon type obs. unless obj. appeared to rise to the Nw. Wallops Island located at 12 deg az. from Manassas, Virginia. Sighting more likely associated with activities from this location if view of initial appearance of meteor and the rising. Also poss. to launch for atmospheric studies from this location.

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

1 MAY 1964

TDFCC/Major George Mills/57223
Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon

TO: TDEW

1. Reference: Sighting of 18 April 1964 1930L near Manassas, Virginia. The time, location and description suggest this sighting may have been the 19 April 00302 radiosondes release from Washington, D.C.

2. Supporting facts
a. The radiosonde train consists of a balloon, a radiosonde package and another intermediate object. Oscillations of the radiosonde package may cause the entire train to take a triangular shape from time to time.
b. The time of the radiosonde train preceded the sighting sufficiently to allow a climb to an altitude consistent with the sighting angle.
c. Sunset for the area occurred at 1849 local time followed by 30 minutes of twilight. At the sighted altitude the radiosonde would first be bathed in direct sunlight. As sunset occurs for the higher elevation the radiosonde would be bathed in more of the reddish light from the sun. This might account for the observed color change. The time and altitude were correct for this transition. There were no weather systems and few clouds to the west which also permits this same color change at sunrise or sunset.
d. The trajectory of the radiosonde train is determined by the following winds:

1000 foot levels
2-12    250    20
14      270    25 
30      290    30
35      310    35
40      320    40
45      330    45

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather is a page of text from an old UFO report document. 

(e.g. 270 degrees is a wind from the west, 250 degrees is from south of west). The rise rate is 1000 feet per minute. The 250 degrees winds would carry the radiosondes train into the NE quadrant which would appear to the observer as a movement to the north. The apparatus motion winds which occurred at higher elevations and from the SE quadrant. At this later time the distance of the radiosondes from the observer reduces the apparent motion.

3. No explanations of this nature are conclusive but there is enough consistency between the observations and the supporting data above to make our hypothesis plausible. Please let me know if more detailed analysis is required.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter dated May 13, 1964, regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object that was reported on April 18, 1964.

Text extracted from the document:

May 13, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This letter is in further reference to the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object you reported seeing on April 18, 1964. 

The time, location and description of this sighting coincide with the release of a radiosonde balloon. The radiosonde train consists of a balloon, a radiosonde package and another intermediate object. Oscillations of the radiosonde package may have caused the object to change shape over time. The release time of the radiosonde train preceded the sighting sufficiently to allow a climb to an altitude consistent with the sighting angle.

It is hoped that this information will answer your query. Thank you for reporting this sighting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
