Introduction.
(1) Large disc, about six inches in diameter.
(2) Two smaller discs, about half the size of the large disc.
(3) Seven smaller discs, below mother disc, and different angles than the two larger discs, on right side rising.

There was three performances of these discs. The first being a fixed pattern already, then all of the smaller discs just disappeared, leaving only the mother disc visible. None of these discs touched. They were there and then they were not there, all in the twinkling of an eye.

FACTS:
A fixed pattern already, the large mother disc, the first one being in two small discs, about half the size of the mother disc, about six inches in diameter on the right side of the mother disc, and one on the left one. Then between and below the right and left dissonance the mother disc, seven small ones about half the size of the right and left discs, one of the smaller discs was directly below the mother disc, and the other six scattered at different angles from the mother disc. A fixed place, and the other ones just disappeared. None of them disintegrated, first they were there and then they were gone.

The way I determined the positions of this phenomena, was by their position above the horizon.

Then I turned my eyes toward the mother disc. The two larger discs were emerging from the opposite side of the mother disc, and going to the relative same position as was in the first phase, the seven smaller discs, each came from different spots and formed the same position, and at the same time. In the first phase, forming no pattern or bearing that I could see or grasp, their color being the same deep soft black as before, even in the rays of the rising sun there was no change in their color or reflection of the sun rays.

THEORY:
These discs could (this is my only possible conclusion) be a new method of photography unknown to us at this time. I remember sometime ago, a Jet pilot chased or these discs. Faster the disc speeded. The pilot was called off the chase. I believe that there could have been a barrier thrust between the Jet and the disc, to which might have added the speed of the Jet to the speed of the disc, to where it would make it impossible for the disc to be overtaken.

The reason for the photography theory is the site and position of these discs should have located at any of the rest of the points of the compass than they have been viewed. As was the location of the compass, they could view Lackland and a good portion of San Antonio. As was the location which lies to the south and adjoining Lackland.

I hope these papers will help you in your department, if so you are welcome to them without further claim or profit of money.

If you wish to use my name on work in your department, use it as you wish. And on oath I will swear to uphold anything I have ever written.

Drawings on separate pages depict the scenes herein described.

Yours very sincerely,
San Antonio, Texas.
