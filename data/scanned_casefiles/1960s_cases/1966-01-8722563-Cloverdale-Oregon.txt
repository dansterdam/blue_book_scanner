Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter which was dated on 21 Jan, 66, I'm sorry to inform that due to poor communication, I was unable to get the address of the sighted aerial phenomenon on the morning of 27 Jan 66. I am unable to locate him. I realize that the information was incomplete and very insufficient, but I hope it won't cause you and your staff inconvenience.

I would appreciate being able to keep the Form 164's to prevent this from happening in the future. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Patrick J. Collier, A30, USAF
