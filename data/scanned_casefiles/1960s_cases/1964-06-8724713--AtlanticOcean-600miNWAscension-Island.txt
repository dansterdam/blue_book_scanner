27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Then place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object, and a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? _______ Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

ITEM
UFO SIGHTING (Classified)

Hq SAC, Westover AFB, Massachusetts
Attention: Major William Berrie

1. We have received a completed form from (redacted) of the
SS NORMACSEERN. The reported direction of flight, description of the
object and other characteristics of the sighting indicate a possible
satellite observation; however, the flight path of the object contained three distinct maneuvers which included the object crossing
its own path. The specific duration did not include the time-motion
sequence of these maneuvers. If the wave in a flight was brief, this
could be caused by unusual atmospheric conditions; however, if the
motion surrounding this portion of the sighting consumed a significant part of the eight minute duration, this would rule out a satellite observation. No mention was made of the manner of disappearance of the object other than that the object disappeared in the
east at about 50 degrees elevation. If the motion was generally
steady, the object observed was probably a satellite.

2. The description presented by Mr. (redacted) presents some characteristics of an astronomical sighting; however, as 3rd Mate of
the SS NORMACSEERN, he should be familiar with the major astronomical points. The Star Vega was at an elevation of 50 degrees and an
azimuth of 090 degrees, very close to the position reported. If
the motion of the object was confined to a very small area, it is
possible that Vega was the cause of the sighting.

3. If the object cannot be correlated with a satellite observation
or with the Star Vega, we can offer no other explanation. The
information presented was insufficiently detailed to present a
firm evaluation of this sighting.

OPERATIONS MEMORANDUM

TO:   U.S. Air Attach√©, AmEmbassy, Pretoria                Date: June 24, 1964

FROM: AmConGen, Durban

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

REF:

The following matter is reported for whatever action you may deem appropriate:

Captain [redacted] Master of the SS NORMACPENN, Official No. 255541, visited the Consuls General on June 23, 1964 to ask if there remained any U.S. Government interest in reports of Unidentified Flying Objects. The Master was told that we had no recent instructions, but would forward a summary of his information to the appropriate authorities.

Captain [redacted] (who did not have his log book with him) stated that in early June, while approximately 600 miles NW of Ascension Island, he, Second Officer [redacted] and Third Officer [redacted] sighted an Unidentified Flying Object overhead. Upon arrival at Ascension Island, where the vessel called outbound from Port Canaveral, the Captain attempted to report the matter to the local U.S. Air Force Installation, but was unsuccessful in establishing contact with any personnel there.

The SS NORMACPENN is due to arrive in Boston mid-August, and the Captain and his two officers may be debriefed at that time if the Air Force, should it still have an interest in UFO reports, wish to secure more details.
