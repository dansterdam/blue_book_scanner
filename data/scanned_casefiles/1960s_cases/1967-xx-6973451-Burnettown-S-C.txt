UFO OVER SOFIA

Trud, no. 275, 24 Nov 67, p. 4, col. 3.                               AN7032972

The following information was transmitted from Sofia on Nov. 23 by telephone from the Bulgarian newspaper "Trud." At sunset, against the sky, appeared a luminous object of unusual shape. At first it looked like a ball, larger than the solar disc. But after a while, it took the shape of a trapezium. It showed be noted that this scalloped flying saucer was moving extremely slowly, and for a certain time was immobile. It was observed through "luneta" field glasses which magnify forty times. In its objective, the flying object looked like a ball or, more precisely, a parachute. In its upper part, it looked like a flattened dark disc, girded by a wide light band. At first, the ball-parachute emitted a silvery blue light, looking like a flame, which gradually became orange. Finally, that luminous object, ever receding, disappeared eastward. In this connection, D. Simetchiyer, who is a scientific worker of the Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology, said that he observed the object with the naked eye and therefore cannot give thorough data. But one can no doubt that it was moving against the wind. This makes it possible to suppose that it had its own engine. Apparently, it flew at 30 km altitude. It is interesting that it did not cause any static in the radio network.

[NCIO]

MOSCOW, Nov. 23 (TASS) - Izvestia said Thursday a page, luminous unidentified flying object - UFO - was reported over Sofia, Soviet Central Television quoted the official Soviet government newspaper Izvestia quoted the Bulgarian news agency BTA as saying. It described a dark disc encircled by a wide bright strip. Izvestia added. The paper did not say in an investigation into UFO was being carried out. Informal sources reported here earlier this month that the Soviet government had set up a commission to investigate UFO reports in this country. A TASS main article in April said the theory that UFOs were visitors from outer space was extremely speculative, but Soviet sightings have not yet been satisfactorily explained.

SUBJECT: UFO Sightings - Denver/Newton/Rockport, Mass. - 23 Nov 1967

DATE: 10 December 1967

FROM: Raymond A. Fowler
        Chairman, NICAP Mass. Subgroup

TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.

REPORTING BACKGROUND:
While enroute from Sylvania to home and listening to the "Paul Harvey Show", a young boy called in and informed Paul that he had heard from a friend who was driving along a Golf Course in Newton, Mass. at 5:15 PM. Paul told the boy it was probably an instance and lot to be at stake. Upon arriving home, I found that Investigator Bob Jackson had been at the source to the SW looking towards Newton from Denver at 5:15 PM.

I called the same investigator (Bob Jackson) in Rockport who stated that his wife, her husband and son sighted an object with unconventional stunning lights at 7:15 PM from their home in Rockport. The sighting was in trace to the Newton sighting down as miles of callers are not reported on these radio shows except for special request of the station by the caller.

This was to be Jack and Judy Jackson's investigation, but due to unavailability of personal data. However, I did dispatch investigators Job Jackson and Bob Jackson and Investigator Bill Hickson - all having information relating to the case and Job Jackson's sightings are attached.

EVALUATION:

Newton: There may have been a connection between the two young boys and the known and then unknown sightings in Denver. The same time the phenomenon was sighted but there is no evidence to indicate that this is the case.

Denver: No object was seen. The light source could have been a conventional aircraft with its landing lights on.

Rockport: The U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter was seen by Bob Jackson fairly close in a nearby area. The Coast Guard Installation revealed that it had been in the Rockport area between 5:30 and 6:30 PM - had hosed at Beverly Airport at 7:15 and later had been at Salem at 7:40. The pilot had not seen anything unusual but stated that he had noticed several UFO helicopters in the Rockport "UFO" was a helicopter, however, the description by the witnesses does not soon completely. The witnesses (Hillsman) in Rockport wanted to be interviewed in their home. They were interviewed in their Florist Shop. However, one investigator persuaded them to let them go to their home. Later Jackson was admitted into their home. It was literally a pigspen - dirt, dead dog on the floor, filthy smells, etc. Jackson had to leave!

CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of data (Newton/Denver) and the seemingly neurotic personalities of the Hillsman's character, no further investigation is planned. While noting the sighting, data could be corroborating, but at present there is insufficient data coupled with witness character problems (Hillsman's).

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler

TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.

SIGHTING BACKGROUND:
...to enroute from Sylvania to home and listening to the "Paul Penguin Talk Show", a young boy called in and informed Paul that he and his friend had been buzzed by a strange-looking aircraft on a golf course in Newton. Upon arriving home he was probably an airplane and let it go at that. Upon arriving home a small thus unspecified time later, he again saw a strange low flying source to the SE (looking towards Newton) from Danvers at 5:15 PM. Here on that evening I received a call from a Mrs. Helene Hildronen...
