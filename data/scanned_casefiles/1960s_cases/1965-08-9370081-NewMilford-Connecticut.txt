Dear Capt. Davis:

I refer to the report of sighting of a flying object at 9:20 PM on 15 Jul 65 south of Danbury, Connecticut.

The sighted flying object was noted in the middle from a height of 1 mile.

The object was a very white object of circular shape.

The object was moving south of 1 type of speed.

Slightly out of sight then passed on sighted by four other reports.

I have the log as being a very

Dear Sirs-

This is to report that on August 21, 1965 at 10 PM on Route U.S. 1-10 miles north of Danbury Connecticut three U.S.'s were sighted. They were circular objects, luminous, but rather hazy which made it impossible to estimate their exact or size. They seemed to be playing some sort of game for they acted around in circle - crossing each others path for about 10 minutes. They acted by signal they took off at great speed and were almost instantly, but to swift. This phenomena was witnessed by four other persons who will substantiate this report. Believe me this was no hallucination or mirage. It was real!
