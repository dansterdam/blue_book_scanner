SATELLITE (ECHO I)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Round star-like object. Observed near to stars. Observation at 40 deg elevation 160 deg azimuth. Disappeared at 20 deg elevation 160 deg azimuth. Flight lasted four minutes, during which time the observer reported that the object moved 80 deg downward and to the test very slowly then shifted to the East still moving, downward for about 3 deg, and then stopped down until it was at 20 deg elevation 160 deg azimuth. At this point the object other flared up or burst. Was (735) BR.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
4 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
160 degrees

8. PHOTOS
□ Yes
X No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
□ Yes

FORM
FTD SEP 65 0-329 (TDE)

COMMENTS: Motion as reported does not correlate with positions of disappearance and description of the object reasonable a satellite motion regarded as an illusion. Disappearance attributed to reentry into the Earth's shadow. ECHO I was at 35 deg N, 75 deg W at the reported time of the observation in position to be observed. Duration and description as well as the reported position consistent with satellite observation.
