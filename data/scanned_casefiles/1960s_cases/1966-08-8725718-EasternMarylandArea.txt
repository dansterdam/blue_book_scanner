10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION (JAH)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Various observers reported red, white, green lights moving in various erratic flight paths. Some objects were going in circles while others remained stationary. No definite shapes were noted, just lights in the sky. Objects appeared as lights only. One object was observed to appear in the west and travel in an eastern direction as a high rate of speed, disappeared over the horizon. Andrews AFB personnel, including their sightings from their tower or their radar. Investigating officer did observe a satellite during the approximate three hour sighting. Insufficient data for comprehensive evaluation.

Took off at a very high rate of speed in a E-NE direction. I turned around when I saw that it was moving up in the opposite direction from my direction of travel. At this time it was on my left shoulder at about 30° altitude, it passed by to my left and was traveling approx 90 mph when it reached my left front of object and hovered. Almost as far as possible without going out of my police orbit. And stopped and watched at that time I called officer Smith and we both watched 5 other objects which came into view and flew about and hovered in the general area of the first object which was either closer then the first or larger. Because the first was higher then any of the others. Officer Smith and myself watched these objects until almost daylight.

MEMO For the Record

1 August 66

In regards to the Eastern Maryland Area sightings the following comments are offered:

At approximately 0230 EDT
                Capella     45° Az & 18' Elevation
                Aldebaran   73° Az & 8° Elevation

At approximately 0500 EDT
        Stars       Capella       58° Az   40' El
                    Belleiguse    90° Az   15' El
                    Aldebaran     95° Az   33' El
                    Pollux        58° Az    8' El

        Planets     Jupiter       65° Az    8° El
                    Mars          67° Az   12° El
                    Venus         70° Az   15° El

                                            Stellar Mag.
                                            - 1.4
                                            - 3.3

According to the Smithsonian Institute tracking service various satellites were due to be visible at 0146, 0225, and 0255 in the morning. Echo I passed over the area at approximately 0146. Echo II should have been visible at approximately 0143.

Since no definite shapes were observed by any of the witnesses, just lights in the sky it appears that the witnesses observed the various stars and planets and satellites that were visible during that August morning. It is a difficult matter to actually determine which of the above culprits were responsible for each of the observations. There were no radar returns of unknown objects in the area, and considering the approximate three hours these objects were visible, there should have been some type of radar pickup. Jupiter and Venus were unusually bright in the morning sky and should have definitely been observed.
