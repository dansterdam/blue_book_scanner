10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj approaching as 1st mag star observed at 200 deg azimuth 10 deg elevation in flight to 085 deg azimuth 17 deg elevation after steady flight with max altitude of 25 deg. Total duration observed 6 min. Disappeared suddenly. TX DX used. Object believed to be Satellite.

11. COMMENTS
At 04/1125Z ECHO was heading SE and not visible at the location of the observer. Possible observation of the other visible satellite, such as 1962 Beta Theta. Case considered as a Satellite observation since all information conforms with this analysis.

The document appears to be a detailed table of satellite orbital data for Earth Satellite 1960 IOTA 1, with data recorded for July 1963. The table includes columns for:

- Equator crossing time
- Longitude
- Latitude
- Time
- North-South coordinates

The data is organized by date (July 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 1963) and provides precise orbital information for the satellite.

At the bottom of the page, there is a section titled "MODIFIED ORBITAL ELEMENTS FOR EARTH SATELLITE 1960 IOTA 1" which includes additional technical details such as:

- Reference time
- Inclination
- Ascending node
- Perigee
- Anomalistic period
- Eccentricity
- Radius of perigee
- Radius of apogee

The document appears to be a technical report from a scientific or military tracking program documenting satellite orbital characteristics.
