POSITION TITLE AND COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER: USAF
CAPT. FLYING SAFETY OFFICER. "IN SPITE OF THE OBSERVER APPARENT
KNOWLEDGE OF USAF AIRCRAFT AND HIS REPORT OF THE T-38, I BELIEVE
MOST OF HIS INFORMATION IS INACCURATE. T-38S DO NOT FLY OVER THIS
PORTION OF TOWN AT ALL UNDER VFR, AND IF THEY WOULD BE HIGHER
THAN 1000 FT. ON THIS DAY CLOUDS WOULD OBSCURE A T-38 IN AN
INSTRUMENT APPROACH PATTERN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT OR
KELLY AFB. THE NOISE THIS CHAP HEARD WAS PROBABLY AN EMERGENCY
VEHICLE TAKING PART IN A NEIGHBORHOOD FIRE STATION ALERT. DURING
THE INTERVIEW THE SOUND WAS HEARD AGAIN AND I WOULD CALL IT AN AUTO
HORN "OUT OF TUNE". ANOTHER POSSIBILITY FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE
NOISE FROM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT THAT IS WORKING ON THE NEXT
STREET SOUTH OF THE OBSERVER'S HOME. COMPRESSED AIR IS RELEASED
FROM TIME TO TIME FROM THIS EQUIPMENT. A LOUD SHRILL WHISTLING
NOISE RESULTS. I HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THE "FLASH OF LIGHT" THE
OBSERVER SAW, NOR THE "JITTERING" OBJECT HE SAW AGAINST THE
CLOUD. POSSIBLY THIS WAS A REFLECTION FROM A NEIGHBORHOOD SWIMMING
POOL OR AUTO WINDOW, WITH BROKEN CLOUDS MOVING OVERHEAD THE OBJECT.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT #55-1
UNVERIFIED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
LOCATION: SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS
DATE: 5 AUGUST 1965
PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-1014 from Major Quintanilla Jr. (TDEW UOO) to analyze photography taken near San Antonio, Texas.
ANALYSIS: Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division, TDEPPA, and the Photo Interpreter.
A. The print shows the edge only, and partial, of a house in the lower right. The exposure time and date are apparent throughout the print.
B. Examination of the print reveals nothing abnormal that would indicate the presence of any unidentified flying objects. However, the negatives were destroyed prior to this processing, so no further analysis can be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: The object mentioned by the observer does not appear in the photograph.
