KNOWLEDGE OF USAF AIRCRAFT AND HIS REPORT OF THE T-38, I BELIEVE
MOST OF HIS INFORMATION IS INACCURATE. T-38S DO NOT FLY OVER THIS
PORTION OF TOWN AT ALL UNDER VFR, AND IF IFR THEY WOULD BE HIGHER
THAN 1000 FT. ON THIS DAY CLOUDS WOULD OBSCURE A T-38 IN AN
INSTRUMENT APPROACH PATTERN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT OR
KELLY AFB. THE NOISE THIS CHAP HEARD WAS PROBABLY AN EMERGENCY
VEHICLE TAKING PART IN A NEIGHBORHOOD FIRE STATION ALERT. DURING
THE INTERVIEW THE SOUND WAS HEARD AGAIN AND I WOULD CALL IT AN AUTO
HORN "OUT OF TUNE". ANOTHER POSSIBILITY FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE
NOISE FROM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT THAT IS WORKING ON THE NEXT
STREET SOUTH OF THE OBSERVER'S HOME. COMPRESSED AIR IS RELEASED
FROM TIME TO TIME FROM THIS EQUIPMENT. A LOUD SHRILL WHISTLING
NOISE RESULTS. I HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THE "FLASH OF LIGHT" THE
OBSERVER SAW, NOR THE "JITTERING" OBJECT HE SAW AGAINST THE
CLOUD. POSSIBLY THIS WAS A REFLECTION FROM A NEIGHBORHOOD SWIMMING
POOL OR AUTO WINDOW. WITH BROKEN CLOUDS MOVING OVERHEAD THE OBJECT
