27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

A aircraft passing over Iowa City are quite common. But this did not appear to be any form of aircraft that I am familiar with. I noticed that it was over 500 ft. distant and traveling at least as fast or - igt. There was absolutely no noise from the object such as this given off by propeller and jet powered craft.

Perhaps it was a lighted balloon. But the speed of the object, the steadiness of path and the fact that the wind at ground level some from the mid-west could have no role in this possibility.

I know after watched earth satellites dim and then bright between dim and this object.

I am familiar with rotors which are fairly common at this time of year. This was not a rotating night flying disk, expecting night flyers, in the summer. But the transit of weight was the object. Then the object traveled would have to negate this possibility.

I am familiar with. Indications one of the textbooks was "Minnesota" work on light and color.

IT was a steadily bright light inside a silent cone. IT did not move zig-zag or divide in any way from its course. The light remained at a constant brightness at all time.

To short, this object was a type that I am not familiar with.

Your name has been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office (Project Blue Book) as being a witness to an unidentified flying object. If you were a witness to a UFO sighting on 28 July 1968 you would please complete the attached AF Form 117 and return it in the envelope provided. If you were not a witness to this sighting, would you please make a statement to this effect on the attached form. The information which you provide will be used in evaluating this observation. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

I am attaching an extra page to the official form.

One of the witnesses served in a Special Forces unit of the United States Army in South East Asia during the early 1960's. He is currently seeking an M.A. in political science from the University of Iowa. Mr. had paratroops training in the Special Forces and is quite familiar with conventional aircraft performance.

The light we saw on July 28, 1968 was unlike anything he had previously encountered.

I do not have any real idea of what the light was. I believe it was in the realm of a type that I am unfamiliar with. Since it behaved in a manner which did not resemble anything I had seen before, I believe the proper course would be to notify Project Blue Book of the sighting.

I hope the information I have supplied in this form may prove to be of assistance in determining the nature of the object sighted.

5 sincerely,

Dear Sirs:

Please send me an official U. S. Air Force UFO form since I wish to report an unusual sighting made over Iowa City tonight by myself and several witnesses. While the object may not have been a UFO, it did not demonstrate any characteristic behavior of conventional aircraft which are quite common over Iowa City.

Some years ago as an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa, I took a course in Descriptive Astronomy. The object that was seen tonight represented no astronomical phenomenon of a familiar pattern. Immediately after the sighting, I made some rough notes describing angle or flight path, time of sighting and direction that object moved.

Please send the form to my address indicated below:

I will be glad to answer any question to the best of my ability.

Sincerely,

AFR 80-17(C1)

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

Handwritten note (partially legible):
The path was more straight- than it was able to show. I was able to change position while the object was flying- and watched.

None that I know of. This was unlike any earth satellite this I have seen before and I could detect no resemblance to the lights of a conventional aircraft.

The clearest manner I can describe the object would be to compare it to a small fuzzy, somewhat oval body of extremely bright light, e.g. a fluorescent light. Other than the light, I could not detect any shape or part of the object. Some other object that may have been connected with the light, the light was the able to observe.

I am currently employed on the Staff of the University of Iowa at the Circulation Department of the Main Library. I hold two degrees in History (B.A. 1961) and (M.A. 1968) from the University of Iowa.

I took private flying lessons from the Fairmont (Minnesota) Flying Service during 1954 - 1955. I was issued an airman identification card at that time by the Civil Aeronautics Administration.

I took a course in Descriptive Astronomy at the University of Iowa during 1953. I had all that I grew up in a rural environment where observation of the sky was quite natural.
