10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj. appeared on radar at 1/2 the size/or strength of the normal A/c return. There was
an incident at Kirksville, Missouri at 22,000 ft and 5 miles NW of Kirksville. Obj was
observed. The radar measured at 22,000' and then turned a 250° descent at 1500'/min with base
line of 0/50 and speed of approx. 300 kts. When object was reached at 20,000' height radar would no
longer paint it. Duration of sighting 1 hr and 5 min. Object was observed on an FPS-6A (height
finder).

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT APPEARED ON RADAR AT 1/2 THE SIZE/SE STRENGTH/SE THE NORMAL AIRCRAFT RETURN. THERE WAS ONLY ONE OBJECT AND WAS MEASURED AT 72,000' AND 65 MILES. THE OBJECT ASCENDED TO 80,000' THEN DRIFTED A SLOW DESCENT AT 100/MIN WITH HEADING OF 330° AND SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 100 KNOTS. WHEN OBJECT REACHED 5000' HEIGHT RADAR WOULD NO LONGER PAINT IT. DURATION OF SIGHTING 1 HOUR 30-5 MINUTES. OBJECT WAS OBSERVED ON AN FPS-4A (THEME) RADAR.

FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THE THREE TWO WIND REPORTS, IT APPEARS THAT THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR THE INCIDENT IS THAT IT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON.

The text on this page is mostly illegible due to poor image quality and scanning. There is a handwritten circle around the text "1962" near the center of the page. Some fragments of text are visible on the right side of the page, but they are not clear enough to confidently transcribe. The page appears to be part of a document with vertical columns, but the details are not discernible.
