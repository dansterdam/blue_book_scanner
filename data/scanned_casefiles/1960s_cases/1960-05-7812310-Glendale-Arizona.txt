Even though the investigator did not ask, made in the report that was not wanted an entry seen a UFO, but something which he could not explain and whatever it might have been, it wasn't an object picked up by the "Dust Devil".
He answered all questions as though he had spent some time thinking of all the important details concerning the sighting and even though the investigator purposefully tried to catch him into answering some of the questions in a manner which would conflict with previous questions, he would not fall for the bait. At one stage he even tried to coach the investigator into asking some additional questions.
On the basis of the interview the reliability of the report of the sighting is rated F-3.
(3) Preliminary Analysis:
Probably saw a white piece of paper which had been picked up and was being tossed about by the wind.
The inversion over the Phoenix Area at the time of observation could have caused reflections or the bending of light rays which would cause the white object plucked up by the wind to react in many way, when observed by the human eye.
1. No physical evidence.

h. Yuma, Arizona soundings between 01100Z and 01240OZ revealed a strong inversion between 11,000 and 15,000 feet. Luise A.P.R. weather estimates this inversion occurred at the approximate time of Mr. observations in the Phoenix area. A check of Radar Stations in the Phoenix area revealed no unusual sightings at the time observation was made in Glendale.

1. No interception or identification action taken.

(1) Sky Harbor Airport, located approximately 10 miles S/E of the observation point, launch small (30 Grad) balloons at 0500Z, 1000Z and 2300Z daily. Sky Harbor Airport states the balloon launched at 01100Z, differed North from the launching site.

(2) Yuma and Tucson, Arizona launch large balloons at 1200Z and 2400Z daily. Unable to check flight paths of these balloons for 1 May.

(2) Comments: was interviewed at his home at 030130Z by the preparing individual. During the interview the impression gained was that was a man of more than average intelligence, who cooperated fully in answering all questions put to him by the investigator. He also stated that he was hesitant in reporting his observation to the military, having been in the Army during World War II and thought perhaps the military would make a joke of his report. seems to know more than the average person about the UFO Program and when asked as to whether or not he had ever observed any strange or unusual objects before, he answered in the negative. He then stated that only recently he had watched an Army or Air Force film on television which showed photographs of UFO's taken by a U.S. Navy Lieutenant in a desert somewhere in the United States along with other photographs and stories of other sightings made by reliable persons, over a period of years. He further stated that the narrator emphasized, that any persons observing any strange object were to report them to the nearest military authority, no matter how foolish the story might sound.
