ATTN OF: O

SUBJECT: UFO Report                                                                                   9 MAY 1960

TO: Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC)
     Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

In compliance with AFR 200-2, dated 14 September 1959, the
following report is submitted:

a. Description of the Object:
    (1) Round
    (2) Quarter
    (3) White
    (4) One (1)
    (5) N/A
    (6) None
    (7) None
    (8) None
    (9) None

b. Description of Course of Object:
    (1) Observer states that he was standing in his back yard
    watching a very strong "Dust Devil" (whirl wind), which had accumulated a lot of paper and was tossing it around in the air. After watching the "Dust Devil" for a period of approximately one (1) minute he observed a round white object crossing the path of the "Dust Devil". At first he thought it to be some object picked up by the wind. However, when the object continued to travel on a straight course at a very high rate of speed, he was sure it was something else.

Here is the text from the document:

Even though the investigator did not ask, wanted an entry made in the report that "We was not making a statement that he had seen a UFO, but something which he could not explain and whatever it might have been, it wasn't an object picked up by the "Dust Devil"".

[Redacted name] answered all questions as though he had spent some time thinking of all the important details concerning the sighting and even though the investigator purposefully tried to coach him into answering some of the questions in a manner which would conflict with previous questions, he would not fall for the bait. At one stage tried to coach the investigator into asking some additional questions.

On the basis of the interview the reliability of [redacted name] report of the sighting is rated F-3.

(3) Preliminary Analysis:

[Redacted name] probably saw a white piece of paper which had been picked up and was being tossed about by the wind.

The inversion over the Phoenix Area at the time of observation could have caused reflections or the bending of light rays which would cause the white object picked up by the wind to react in many way, when observed by the human eye.

h. Yuma, Arizona soundings between 011200Z and 012400Z revealed a strong inversion between 11,000 and 15,000 feet. Luke AFB, weather estimates this inversion occurred at the approximate time of Mr. Mt sighting. A check of Radar Stations in the Phoenix area revealed no unusual sightings at the time observation was made in Glendale.

1. No interception or identification action taken.

j. (1) Sky Harbor Airport, located approximately 10 miles S/E of the observation point, launch small (30 Gram) balloons at 0500Z, 1100Z and 2300Z daily. Sky Harbor Airport state the balloon launched at 011100Z, drifted North from the launching site.

(2) Yuma and Tuscon, Arizona launch large balloons at 1200Z and 2400Z daily. Unable to check flight paths of these balloons for 1 May.

(2) Comments:

[Redacted name] was interviewed at his home at 030130Z by the preparing individual.

During the interview the impression gained was that [redacted name] was a man of more than average intelligence, who cooperated fully in answering all questions put to him by the investigator.

He also stated that he was hesitant in reporting his observation to the military, having been in the Army during World War II and thought perhaps the military would make a joke of his report.

[Redacted name] seems to know more than the average person about the UFO Program and when asked as to whether or not he had ever observed any strange or unusual objects before, he answered in the negative.

[Redacted name] then stated that only recently he had watched an Army or Air Force film on television which showed photographs of UFOS taken by a U. S. Navy Lieutenant in a desert somewhere in the United States along with other photographs and stories of other sightings made by reliable persons, over a period of years. He further stated that the narrator emphasized, that any persons observing any strange object were to report them to the nearest military authority, no matter how foolish the story might sound.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Glendale, Arizona

Date 1 May 1960 Hour (Z) 2020Z

WX Clear, vis 45 mi, winds var at 5 to 55 knots, strong inv 11k & 15k feet

Description Round, size of a quarter, white, was watching dust devil, first seen approx 45 deg SW, last seen about 30 deg elev NE, moved in straight path, faded in NE direction, in sight no more than 15 seconds

Direction of Motion Northeast

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Ruled out

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1) None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) None

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.

Other Possibly some object picked up by the wind (Unidentified origin)

Evaluation of Source Reliability Unknown

Analysis and Conclusions: This is a "one witness" sighting. "Unidentified" category. Following the "dust devil" in the area, discovered the object, distant from the generally known or seen object... The possibility that this was some type mirage is fairly recent - however, in the absence of sufficient evidence no conclusion is offered.
