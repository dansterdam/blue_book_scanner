IDENT/UFO                                                      23 January 1967
UFO Observations

Minneapolis, Minnesota  55407

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Reference your letter of 5 December 1966 regarding the observation of an unidentified flying object approximately one month earlier. The sighting that you mentioned occurred while you were walking through a desert area. A comprehensive analysis can be made if you provide the enclosed FED Form 164 and return it in the envelope.

In regards to your other observations, at such a late date a detailed and meaningful study would be extremely difficult.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

One of my sightings is related to a story written by a doctor in a current magazine where I saw a few flying unfathomable object (a string of orange lights) land in a field 10 blocks from me. I got there fast as I could and when I got there was a circle of flame in the field. It was in the suburbs of a large city surrounded by a forest - this was quite a while ago I thought.

Dear Sir,

I noticed in a magazine that it listed things to do if you see a UFO. Having worked for two school papers and the Institution papers I have never to a controversial subject.

Well any way to report the incident. About a month ago I was walking alone through a deserted park and something caught my attention to make me look up at the sky and just what I saw something appeared at first I thought it was a falling star but it was real low and large, then I thought it was an airplane since I live near an airport but it was going much to fast for an aircraft and all of me side in deep concern. I do not know, was not wearing them at the time, they are only for reading. I thought of it being a satellite but why would it be so low going so fast and also peering it is also true that couple of weeks later a person I know told me about something he saw from the same place in the park before I told him of my incident. He said a large red light went in a direction like a square and close to the park in the sky. This incident is the third I have seen and cannot explain. Thank You for your time.

Sincerely,
