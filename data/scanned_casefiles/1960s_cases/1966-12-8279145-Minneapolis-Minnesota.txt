Minneapolis, Minnesota 55407

Dear Mr.

Reference your letter of 5 December 1966 regarding the observation of a sighting of an unidentified flying object approximately one month earlier.

The sighting time you mentioned occurred while I was away on official business and was not reported. However, the enclosed AF Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided.

As regards to your other observations, as such a late date a detailed and meaningful study would be extremely difficult.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
