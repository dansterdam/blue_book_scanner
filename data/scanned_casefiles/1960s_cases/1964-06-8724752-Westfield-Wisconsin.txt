Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

We have the analysis of your "conversation place" back sooner than I had expected. It is definitely not a meteorite. It is, however, a rather rare example (in your part of the country) of a chunk of native copper. This native copper occurs much farther north than you are, but this was unquestionably brought down to your area by a glacier.

Native copper is closely tied up with the history of northern Michigan and Wisconsin, as it was the presence of native copper that really opened up the territory.

I am sorry that I can't say that you have a meteorite, but you still do have a good conversation place.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

We have found what we are now in a field of yellow metal one of the newspaper not copy of published an article about the defence department being interested in them, and about flying being paid for them. Also our desire to the almost solid copper and it is very cheap for its size. We have cut a small piece from it and could send it to labs over would be interested in it. I think it would weigh about 8 pounds and is about "beach metal" - kindly long and round electronic an effect - appears sharp.

Sincerely,
[Signature blacked out]
