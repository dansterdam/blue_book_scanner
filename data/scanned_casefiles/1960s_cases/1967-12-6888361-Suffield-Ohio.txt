11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a bright round object that was traveling at a high speed toward the south. The observer stated that he heard a beep and also flashing lights.

Comments: A 117 was sent to the observer. Such things as the size (angular) of the object; the number and color of the lights; and how bright the object was in comparison to some common astro object, such as Venus, is not known. The 117 was not returned. Since the observer was in a house during the sighting it is doubtful that the "beep" is related to the sighting. It appears to have been either an airplane or a satellite, however without additional information it is impossible to tell.
