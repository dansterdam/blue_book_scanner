There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows handwritten text and a sketch.

The text reads:

"Again at the southern of cornea(?) Suffield, ohio a brightly glowing object, an 20 minutes ago The loudish sound was heard It was round shaped, Data R-13-67."

The sketch shows a roughly drawn shape, which appears to be an outline or representation of the object described in the text.

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document that contains only text that has been redacted or obscured.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have analyzed the text in the document and can confirm that there is no readable text visible. The entire page appears to have been redacted or obscured, leaving only black shapes and marks on a white background.
