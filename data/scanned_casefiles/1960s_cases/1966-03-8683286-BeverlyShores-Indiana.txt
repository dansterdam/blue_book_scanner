Attention: Project Blue Book

Dear Sirs-

Recently, amongst other letters, I write to you on April 7, 1966, and made other contacts in accordance with advice from authorities here.

My letter to you and visit of you in regards to my experience on March 30, 1966, with a UFO which I first sighted amongst the trees near to type about 50 feet from my home, and within a very short time it landed on the ground about 6 feet from the window where I was standing watching it, and from the large center light of then back long lighted points all around it. I stared at the clear, and it was then just 5:20am it stayed on that spot until 6:30 AM.

I have not received a reply from you acknowledging receipt of my letter to you,
astro(Venus) & moon

and I am wondering if you received the
& heard yesterday that these UFOs there been
seen near home has one to operate has
touched the electric wires with something
evidently tapping them for electric current
at the expense of the property owners.

Now, in regard to the enclosed clipping
from my yesterday's Gary Sunday Post-
Tribune, I wish to advise that on 4:30 AM
(just dawn) Sunday morning (April 17, '66)
I also sighted a large round white light
on the salt coming up over the horizon,
at first I thought it was the morning,
but on second thought I realized that the
sunrise would be later - yet white -
as I watched it flying closer and
slowly - until it was over the flat
properties nearby.

Then suddenly a bright red light
shone on the night side of my face
which had come in through the 3 windows
pane in my great outside door. It was
acting very fast, along the ridge of
the dune across the street from home,

Here is the text from the document:

Then crossed Broadway, which is about 30'
left east of my property, then up in the
city until it met the white lighted
object which had come from the east,
but below-it, for just a couple of minutes
- then flew gate again northward into
the duneland. The white light then
disappeared. It was very evident
that they had made an appointment to
meet in this area for the purpose of
conveying a message, which accounted
for the red light of lying beneath the
white one so the white message could
be dropped to him on a wire or string.

This may have been what was chased
by Deputy Sheriff Dale T. Eggers and
his partner of Ravenna, Ohio, the
same morning. It very definitely
was not Venus.

I have reasons to believe that
Russians are operating these UFOs,
and my next contacts will be with
President Johnson and our U.S. Senator
Birch E. Blyth.

These mysterious things are something that should not be disregarded, especially in times of war, and I am determined to continue my contacts until there is some development in the solution of this mystery.

I should appreciate some word from you which will throw some light on the subject.

Yours very truly

Then when I looked at it again
it was next to another tree nearby,
so I knew it was moving but it
did not appear to be.

Next, it landed on the
ground about 8 feet east of
where I was standing in the
window of my home.

It was a large round silvery
looking light with long lighted
points all around it. I could
not see anyone who might be
operating it.

Then, at 6:30 AM it raised
itself and flew across the street
and landed on the lawn of the
home there for just a minute,
when it went up in the air again
above the trees and flew east
until it appeared to be above
Michigan City.

Attention Project Blue Book
Dear Sirs -

On March 30, at 5:20 AM
until 6:30 AM I watched what
I first thought was an unusual
blinking station hanging in the air
next to a certain tree about 50 feet
east of my home. I had been
sound asleep and suddenly my
eyes glinted wide open. I looked
out of the window and took a
good look at it. I looked at the
clock and it was just 5:20.
Then looked around at the sky
for other stars, but there were
- it was just dawn.

Now it changed its course and
flew southeast until I could not
see it any farther.

I feel that something should be
done to find out what these arial
phenomena are and what is their
purpose. But I did not know
where to start until someone
suggested that I call the Michigan
City (News) dispatch. That was it.
They suggested that I phone the
Air Force and gave me the phone
number, which I did.

They suggested that I phone
the State Police at a Chesterton
number, which I did, and
also suggested that I write to the
Wright- Patterson AFB

Attention Project Blue Book.

who they also stated investigate
all reports of this nature, and
this is it.

A friend of mine who also
lives in Beverly Shores was
over last evening and she has
been ill ever since one evening
recently when she went out to her
coal shed to get some coal, and
on her way back to the house
she sighted in the sky overhead
what she thought was a "Flying
Saucer" with a red caplike cover
over it. Immediately she touched
a wire which was hanging in the
air from the "Flying Saucer"
above her, and it gave her an
electric shock.

Now these things are not good,
and I hope you will make an investigation on them.

Gary pd. 4-24-66
UFO Sighted
By Deputy
Called Star

WASHINGTON (AP) — That object in the sky Deputy Sheriff Dale F. Spaur of Ravenna, Ohio, said he and his partner chased for an hour and a half last Sunday probably was the planet Venus, says the Air Force.

Spaur reported "somebody had control over". But the Air Force said "radar indicates that no airborne objects were in the area at the time of the sighting." Venus was rising in the southeast at the time, the Air Force said, and was brighter than any star in the sky.

The same night, Police Chief Gerald Buchert of nearby Mantua, Ohio, said he took a picture of an object resembling "two table saucers put together." Concerning Buchert's claim the Air Force said:

"Photoanalysis of the negative indicates that the "very bright light" which he tried to photograph does not appear as an image. The two images which appear on the negative are probably the result of pre-existing defects to old fogged film and poor handling..."

Elmwoods of persons in both Ohio and Pennsylvania reported seeing a "brilliant and shiny" object in the sky early Sunday. The Air Force did not comment on this.
