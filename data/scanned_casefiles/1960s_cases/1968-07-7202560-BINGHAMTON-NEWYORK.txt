PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7-22-68
2. LOCATION: BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK

3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: TWO

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: THREE MINUTES

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND-VISUAL

7. COURSE: NO DATA

8. PHOTOS: YES
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: YES

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an "oblong object (?)" that had a dropping tail and flashing lights.

COMMENTS: The observer submitted his report on a AF Form 117. Since we did not send it to him and SAFQIOC apparently did not send it to him, we have no idea how he got it. The report itself seems confusing. A Form 117 was sent to the listed witnesses as of 24 September 1968, but none have returned their forms as of 26 September 1968. Because the submitted report is confusing and no witness would confirm the sighting, it is being carried as Insufficient Data.

FORM FTD SEP 0-329 (TDE) Previous editions of this form may be used.

INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE:

I saw the 2 objects at first there. I called MR. [illegible name] came to come out & look at them.

One object looked colored at head a slipping tail and had flexing. He referred to Police that I saw them and told me that if any more, might call in. Also would want a heck on it.

I give my permission to be used in connection with my statements and conclusions.
