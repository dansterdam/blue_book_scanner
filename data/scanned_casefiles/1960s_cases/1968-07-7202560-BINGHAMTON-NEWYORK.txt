CONCLUSION:
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an "oblong object" (1) that had a dropping light. COMMENTS: The observer submitted his report on a AF Form 117, but does not need to be run and GRAPHIC separately. The report itself is somewhat confusing. A Form 117 was not submitted to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) as there may be no evidence to confirm the sighting carried out as investigation.

The image appears to contain a compass-like diagram and two landscape sketches. The compass diagram provides instructions on how to indicate the direction to an observed phenomenon using the 16 cardinal directions. The landscape sketches show a person standing in the foreground of a hilly or mountainous terrain.

The text extracted from the image is as follows:

"ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS TO BE FILED WITH EACH REPORT OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A `X` ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. 

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN `X` AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A `+` AT THE POSITION ` 5 ` OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECT THE `X` AND `+` WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON.
