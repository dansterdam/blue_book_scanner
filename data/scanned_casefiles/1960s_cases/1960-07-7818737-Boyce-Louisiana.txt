UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Boyce, Louisiana
Date: 27 July 1960
Hour (Z): 2232
WX: Clear, 15 mi vis, winds NE at 6-20 knots
Description: Round, size of dime increasing to softball, color changed from red to white and light green, a cigar-shaped object was seen in the center of the round object and increased in size. It was a small circular area and it came in and out of the small circular first seen at 49 degrees, did not see if disappear, object was stationary moving up and down.
Satellite: (ARGUS-B3, Phone 692919) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Const, Planet, etc.):
Radar Analysis (AGCIN-EL):
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.):
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Correct temperature as same position too long
Other:
Evaluation of Source Reliability:
Analysis and Conclusions: It is quite possible that the object described was a natural phenomenon of some kind that was not identified. The description does not seem to indicate an aircraft, satellite, or astronomical object. The object was apparently stationary and changing in size, which could be consistent with a natural atmospheric phenomenon. However, without more information, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion.
