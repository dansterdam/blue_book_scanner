UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Boyce, Louisiana

Date: 22 July 1960        Hour (Z): 0602

WX: Clear, 15 mi vis, winds NE at 0-20 knots

Description: Round, size of dime increasing to softball, color changed from red to white and light green, it appeared to diminish and increase in size, it had a red circle around it part of the time, first seen 45 deg elev at 49 degrees, did not see it disappear, object was stationary moving up, down, right & left seen the object for three hours

Direction of Motion: stationary

Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219)    Filled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Possibly
Transit MARS - STAR ALDEBARAN

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): N/A

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): —

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: OBJECT REMAINED IN RELATION TO THE SAME POSITION TOO LONG

Other: —

Evaluation of Source Reliability: (UNKNOWN)

Analysis and Conclusions: IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE WITNESSES WERE OBSERVING THE PLANET MARS AND LATER THE STAR ALDEBARAN UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DESCRIPTION FITS THAT OF A STAR OR PLANET WHEN REFRACTED BY THE ATMOSPHERE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE WITNESS PROBABLY SAW THESE.

Astronomical Objects.

Subsequent Discussion (Phone) with the Investigator brought out the fact that the window was low, 24" from the floor and the bed 20" from the floor. The window was probed up in bed and therefore possibly cooking out at a considerable less elevation than required.
