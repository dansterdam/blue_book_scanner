ATTN OF: AFCIN-4X2

SUBJECT: Extract from Duty Officers' Report

TO: AFCIN-462 (Maj Friend)                                     31 MAY 1960

The following, extracted from Capt Radcliffe's Report dated 29 May 1960,
is quoted for your information.

This report was received from the AFCIN DO at 0600, 30 May.

"The original report was a SAC report from Biggs AFB, El Paso,
Tex. A civilian in that area reported seeing a large bright
object moving slowly to the south over El Paso. He further
indicated that the object had a bright orange call.

Two El Paso policemen and the Biggs weather observer also
saw this object. The policemen reported seeing it move
southeast and break into two pieces. One of the pieces
fell to the ground while the other continued its flight.
That part of this object which fell to the ground is be-
lieved to have fallen near the Rio Grande river.

A T-33 Acft reported seeing this phenomena near Alamogordo,
New Mexico. The entire incident occurred approximately 0530Z,
30 May."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency)                    REPORT NO.                    PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES
Biggs AFB, Texas                 Initial Report

Paragraph k. Preliminary analysis: Generally the data received from
witnesses reflect that the object closely resembled a meteor in appearance,
shape and flight path. There appears to be conflicting information as
to the amount of time that the object was in view however I feel that
the average time indicated by the observers to be approximately 10 seconds.
The obvious distance traveled by the object during this period also conforms
to the speed of a meteoric. Meteors are also known to explode and
seperate which could explain the reports of several viewers that the
object broke into. No information in any of the reports indicated that
the object was any thing other than an astronomical body.
