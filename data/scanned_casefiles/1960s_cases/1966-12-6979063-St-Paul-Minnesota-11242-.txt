Now, I will act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

REPHONE CALL
6 December 1966 
Telephone Call to: Captain HTEK, USSR, Blue Book
From: Mr. BYERS, USIS, St. Paul, Minnesota

Call received at 1130L on 6 December 1966. 
Mr. BYERS reported observing an unidentified flying object over St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 1900L on 24 November 1966.

Mr. BYERS stated that he observed a bright, round, silver-colored object hovering in the sky over St. Paul for approximately 10-15 minutes. The object appeared to be 20-30 feet in diameter. There were no exhaust trails or other visible means of propulsion. The object was observed to make a sudden and rapid vertical ascent before disappearing from view.

Mr. BYERS said he was able to obtain a photograph of the object, which he has submitted to the United States Air Force for analysis. No further details were provided.

This concludes the telephone call report.
