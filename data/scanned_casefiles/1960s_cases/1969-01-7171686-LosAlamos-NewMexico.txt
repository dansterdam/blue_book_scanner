The image contains a compass rose diagram in the top portion, and two sketches of landscape scenes in the bottom portion. The compass rose diagram appears to be provided as a reference tool for indicating the direction of an observed phenomenon. The two landscape sketches depict people standing in open fields or roads, presumably representing how an observed phenomenon may have appeared from their perspective.
