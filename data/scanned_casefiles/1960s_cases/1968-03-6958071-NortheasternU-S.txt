UFO was a Zond

Correspondent of
New Scientist

Across the eastern United States, from Northern Tennessee to north-eastern Pennsylvania, Sunday evening, 3 March 1968, was clear and cold. The Moon, now up in the 28th day of its period, was going into its first quarter. At approximately 9:15 pm John R. Wilson of Alexandria, Kentucky, saw three objects in the sky moving from south south easterly to a north north westerly direction.

"They were in my sight," he wrote, "for about three or four minutes". When Mr Wilson first saw the objects they looked, he said, "like a single small white light in the sky about the size of the blinker light I see on planes, but when this light did not blink I watched it intently wondering why it was so constant. As it approached, it grew larger and looked like the nose of a plane. I thought, 'how strange, the whole cockpit of that plane is lit up'. Then I saw red streaks emanating from the object and I thought, 'the plane is on fire'. Then directly behind the first object I saw a second and just before they were overhead I observed there was a third. They weren't planes, they weren't on fire, there was no sound and no smoke but they were emitting cherry red streaks of exhaust five or six times the length of the objects. It was a beautiful sight to behold and the wonder was that, with all this speed, there was no sound'."

At about the same time on the outskirts of Cincinnati, Ohio, a Mr Edwin W. Daley reported that he saw an object, due east about 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon. Mr Daley describes himself as an amateur astronomer and a member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. "There were three star-like objects, close together," he wrote. "The leading one was about 30 feet or less ahead of the others which were closer together. There was a beautiful, long, persistent vapor trail. The three objects were of equal brightness. The rate of motion was faster than a high-flying jet plane but slower then a meteor". He lost sight of the objects when they were within five degrees of the horizon.

These accounts and others like them—about a couple of dozen in all—are on file in a tiny three-room office in Washington, DC, the headquarters of an organization known as the National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). A similar and much larger file of about 70 accounts is in the Aerial Phenomena Office of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

It is now apparent that the March phenomenon was the return to Earth of fragments of the Soviet Union's satellite Zond II—an apparently abortive Moon probe. Zond II was launched on Saturday 2 March. The following day the Soviet Union announced it had been placed in a parking orbit until it would be in position for launching farther from Earth. The assumption was that the satellite was intended to travel to the environs of the Moon to take photographs and then return to Earth. But on Sunday night at approximately 0245 UT (2145 Eastern Standard Time in the United States) a piece of Zond II re-entered over the north-eastern area of the United States. It probably landed somewhere on the next day. Had he heard about the reports of the strange sighting over the north east the previous night? He had not, it was not before he did, Mr Roth works at United's office at Singleton Airport where, among his other duties, he is director of the Volunteer Flight Officer Network.

"This group, which he started, collects pilot reports of unusual sightings of aerial phenomena (UFO) and collates the observations in an attempt to fix the source. The University of Colorado is interested in UFOs because it is there that a study, directed by Dr Edward Condon, on UFOs is being undertaken. It should be available before the end of the year. Later that week, Mr Roth received several reports from pilots who had seen the event, all of them pointing toward the trajectory of the Zond II re-entry path.

The UFO enthusiasts, for their part, are quick to point out that not all such sightings as the one of 3 March can be attributed to returning debris from space. Nevertheless it is just this material coming in from space that is now receiving attention as a new type of hazard to high flying aircraft and Mr. Roth has been asked to help deal with it. Mr. Roth estimates that the chance of a plane being hit by a piece of space debris is less than one in a million. But with more high-flying aircraft and with the advent of the supersonic planes which will fly at heights between 70 000 and 80 000ft these chances will increase. At 80 000 such debris returning to Earth will be speeding at 2000 mile/hr. If even a small piece hit the fuselage of a pressurized plane the resulting sudden decompression would be explosive.

It was quietly revealed, after the publicizing of the Zond IV incident, that Mr Roth with the co-operation of the North American Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs, some 60 miles south of Denver, had for some months been operating an early warning system to alert aircraft to debris falling out of Earth orbit.

Two months before the scheduled decay of a satellite the Defense Command computes the predicted trajectory of the satellite, refining and recalculating the path right up until only two hours before the vehicle re-enters the atmosphere. With the communications facilities of United Airlines, aircraft whose routes cross the predicted re-entry corridor can be warned and diverted out of the area during the danger period which is about half an hour at the maximum.

Most planes fly at low enough altitudes to avoid the danger of being hit by satellites, burned-out rocket engines and housings still travelling at the high velocities with which they could strike high flying supersonic planes. Nevertheless with the increasing frequency of satellites being placed in orbit the hazard is bound to increase. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimates that there are 350 satellites in orbit and almost 1000 bits of rocket casings and other material that entered orbit with the satellites. It is a measure of the distance Man has come in 10 years of space exploration. A decade ago the challenge was to get

Question 21

THE PERSON I POINTED THIS TO MY KNOWLEDGE RECENTLY MY POSITION TO THE PRECEDING SIGHTING WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT I RELATED IS ITEM THIS TIME. I SEE HAS NOT YET DEFENSE AS IN PREVIOUS ANSWER FOR.

AFTER I CAME INTO THE AREA OVER POSSIBLE PRIOR TO SUCH I SAW I WAS EXPECTING HER PHONE (YES OR NO) TO BE TOLD I AND TO FORCE MYSELF TO SAY THERE. I COULD NOT HANDLE THIS MATTER. BUT EVEN THEN I DROPPED OFF SEVERAL MILES FROM THIS & EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. PERHAPS FEELING THAT I HAD SWEPT TO THIS MILE BEFORE I HAD HIS NOT YET AFTERNOON. I HAD BEEN OUTSIDE IN THE COLD AN SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING NORMAL WAS UNTIL I FELT PHYSICALLY DEPRESSED JUST AND TO SLEEP. THIS CHANGING SCENE LEFT UNTIL BY NOW, I WAS GOING THROUGH AREA MY FRIEND REALIZED THAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME. I SEE WHEN I SHOT INTO THE AREA IT HAPPENED THAT I RETURNED THAT IT HAPPENED TO YOU PRESUMABLY DID NOT KNOW OTHERS AND SEEM THIS WHILE I HEARD IT IN THE AREA. I DID THEN MANAGEABLE AS MIGHT GOES WELL TOLD. (PERHAPS NEAR WASHINGTON, D.C.)

I ALSO HAVE AN ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM I HAD A FLASH LITE IN MY HAND WHICH I ALWAYS CARRY WHILE ITS DARK OUT. I WANT TO USE MY FIELD GLASSES. I SIGNALED S S S (SOME CODE)

IN MORSE CODE. THE SEQUENCE SEEMS THAT I WAS WHILE THAT REMEMBER MAY NOT BE AN ANYTHING IS IT. I HAVE KEPT SHOW IT WASN'T WORKING EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WHERE RESPONSE EXPECTED.

UFOs Just Debris, Blu

By DALE HUFFMAN
Daily News Staff Writer

At about 9:20 p.m. EDT on Mar. 3rd a
National Cash Register Co. executive
was driving north on I-75 between Cincinnati and Dayton. He glanced upward
toward the top of his windshield and saw
a "succession of three fiery objects in
the sky."

"They were in perfect formation" the
executive - later reported to Wright-Patterson AFB's Project Blue Book office
five minutes, trying to keep my eyes on
the highway.

STATING HE HOPED no one would
think him highly imaginative or insane,
the man said the objects "seemed to be
at a high altitude and I could not determine if they were flying horizontally or
descending."

At 9:35 the same night, Xavier senior
Mike Mosco, home in Springfield for the
week end, was driving on N. Fountain
Ave. with his fiance, Mary Mahall. They
spotted unusual lights in the sky.

"Look at that!" Mary called out. Mike
stopped the car and they climbed out for
a better look.

WHAT THEY SAW. Mike reported
later, was a "long bright object which
looked like an elongated cigar coming
out the windows, and three jets in the
tail."

Reports passed to Lt. Col. Hector
Quintanilla, 2nd Blue Project Book
aide.

A woman said her dog hid between two
trash cans in her driveway and whimpered when the UFO went over.

A science teacher, who said he held a
doctor's degree, recently tried to signal
the UFO with a small light.

And to date it is the most thoroughly
documented revealing UFO episode he
has worked with. Now, for all practical
purposes, the case is closed.

"WE NEVER HAVE been, nor will we
be in touch with Russian officials in the
matter," said Quintanilla. "The state
department would handle any such communication."

The only question I have is in path of flight. It appeared that the object came from the ground and went back to the ground. This appeared so because of pattern of three lights and sparks.. But I wonder if flight path was parallel to the ground and at a certain altitude. And that if the above appearance could have been caused by some illusion.

Please send me information on what to do in the event of a future sighting. I have often wondered about reports of landings, why people did not shoot at or attempt to capture, or something. I think some effort should be made on the part of sighting to obtain proof and identification since he is the only one on hand.

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter in regards to the satellite that was seen on March 3, 1968, around 9 P.M.

On that date, I saw something in the sky that looked like a ball of fire. As I was watching, it broke into three different parts, each part disappearing at different times. I'd say that there was approximately three to four seconds between the disappearance of each (this is a rough estimation). One part could be seen longer than the others, but I can't tell you if it also died out or not. I did not hear anything like a clap of thunder.

If I can be of further help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

[Redacted location: Kane, Pennsylvania]

SKETCHES OF UFO SEEN ON EVENING OF MAR. 3
'Long Bright Object'—Staff Photos by Wally Nelson

Said Quintanilla, "They are an independent scientific group. They come up with their own conclusions in matters of UFO research, but we cooperate with them one hundred per cent."

DESPITE THE FLURRY surrounding periods perhaps more people now are conscious of the Blue Book program. A rapidly added aspect of the technology, and of his five years as head of the Blue Book program has been the sharp decline in reports of sightings this year.

"I've thought a lot about it and tried to assess the reason," said Quintanilla.

"Perhaps one reason for the decline is that so much has been written recently about the whole subject."

It's just speculation on my part, but ASKED IF HE personally believed there are flying objects in space, he said:

"I'm often asked this. There is no evidence whatsoever to support this hypothesis. And I have 20 years of reports and records on the whole matter in my possession."

"But as long as there is a sky," he surmised, "some folks will believe there are objects out there can't be other planets."

"YOU NEWSPAPER people started it all," Quintanilla said. "Back in 1947 newspaper reporter coined the word 'flying saucer.' It's been with us ever since. You reporters can invent things, too."

In his official record book, Quintanilla has only one object enumerated under investigation which has not been identified.

A citizen in Gooberton, Mo., reported being awakened in his middle of the night. He estimated the object he saw was about 100 yards long in diameter, and had "fiery, flashing bright yellow and green lights."

"WE HAVE NOT FOUND much to work on in this case," said Quintanilla. "But we are pursuing it, as we do every report we get."

As of today, the Air Force has received 135 UFO reports since Jan. 1 Of these, 21 were attributed to planes or other astronomical objects, 19 to aircraft, 10 to balloons, 8 to earth satellites, and 22 to other known causes. Thirty-five cases are pending in which identification is imminent.

"It keeps up at this rate," Quintanilla said. "This will be the lowest year yet."

He added, "I don't think I'll ever be out of a job, though."

The document also contains two sketches of UFO sightings, labeled "Pilot" and "Citizen", with detailed drawings of elongated objects.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                3 April 1968

Subj: UFO OBSERVATION, 3 Mar 68
Mr. [redacted] called collect to the Aerial Phenomena Office on 3 Apr 68 regarding his observation of 3 Mar that was most probably satellite decay.

DATE/TIME:     3 Mar 68, approximately 9:40 pm, EST
DURATION:      Approximately 15 seconds
COURSE:        SW to NE or possible SSW to NNE
OBJECTS:       three at first, then one
OBSERVERS LOCATION: Driving west on Rt 6, one mile east of Kane, Pa

GENERAL COMMENTS: The observer was driving west on [redacted] when he first saw the objects. When he first saw them, there were three, well above the horizon "my own estimate from talking to him was 30 to 40 deg above the horizon" according to Lt Marano. The objects were whitish in color and were three in number. The observer drove on less than one-fourth mile (1/4), until he found a parking place. He stopped and got out. During the time two of the objects had disappeared (the observer did not see them disappear). The observer only saw the one object at disappearance; it passed due west of him at about 30 to 40 deg elevation heading approximately NE. The object continued on its course and disappeared in the NE of NNE at about 30 to 40 deg elev.

The object appeared like flame (reddish) before it disappeared. The observer could not given an estimate of how bright the object was but gave the following statement "You know how bright the full moon is, you can see by its light (it will cast shadows) and you know how bright Venus is, you can't really see by it, well you couldn't see by the light of the object but it was quite easily seen." The observer stated that as the object passed directly in front of him the angular velocity seemed much greater than when he first saw the object.

NOTE:          An AF Form 117 will be sent to Mr. [redacted] at his request and he will provide more specific directions and elevations.

Subject:   Analysis of Aerial Phenomena Sited 3 March 1968
Enclosure: Map of Kane, Pennsylvania Area

Dear Lt. Tobey:

The letters recently forwarded to GAC regarding aerial phenomena sited by local residents of north central Pennsylvania on 3 March 1968 have been examined.

It is concluded from this new information that at least three pieces traveled beyond impact area A, reported earlier (see Enclosure). Two of these three pieces could have landed in area B. The third piece evidently continued beyond area B, probably landing in area C.

If you feel it is warranted a more exact analysis could be performed using the GAC 3-degree-of-freedom re-entry program. However, such an analysis would only be worthwhile if additional information can be made available regarding the orbit of these items.

I am writing in reference to the article in the newspaper concerning the incident of March 6, 1968 and of Mr. [redacted] sighted orange red lights, moving from the Pelham Parkway area. Since we had this lights reported with some light describing forward partially, flying directly northward, disappearing into the northern horizon. We heard no further sounds or details were shown, such as, when rockets are released in stages.

Dear Sir,

I was looking about on Wed. Apr. 3, 1968 between 8:45 and 9:00, about 8:55. I saw in fine (wall), at first time, I thought it was a meteorite. I saw in the newspaper of Apr. 10, 1968 where a couple also saw this phenomena. I thought it was about the size of an orange held at arm's length. I did not have anything like a boom or the like.

Please excuse the informality. There were two other boys with me who also saw this.

If you have any questions you may write me by mail at:

Dear Sirs:

On March 4th, one of our local newspapers, "The Nashville Tennessean," published an account of sightings of an UFO and put it on front page. The Tennessean gave a report that I shall copy in part --- "8:45 PM Central Standard Time, Sun., Mar. 3, 1968 ---- traveling from southwest to northeast in a flat trajectory. Descriptions of the UFO varied slightly, but, in general, as it flew over Nashville, it was described as fuel-gas-shaped with lights that appeared from windows. All agreed that it was flying at a high rate of speed and made no noise. Many reported an orange trail behind the object. Officials at Berry Field (Airport) said they had numerous reports of sightings. They also reported that the UFO had been seen in Little Rock, Ark., Memphis, Tenn., Jackson, Tenn., Lexington, Ky., and Roanoke, Va. A person named [redacted] said that the FAA had reports of sightings all over the southeast."

I have written a report containing a description of my sighting of the UFO and its flight as I observed it over Nashville, Tenn., while standing beside [redacted] and my [redacted]. I wrote my description from notes I had taken a few days after the event, as I had learned in school that for better accuracy, one should take notes early. I feel it important to relate to you the amount of alcoholic beverage that I had consumed prior to my UFO sighting. Also, I feel it important to relate to you some references as to my character.

March 2nd: I consumed no alcoholic beverages -- or drugs of any kind.
March 3rd: ---- I consumed no alcoholic beverages (or drugs) until we arrived

THE PARTHENON
In Centennial Park
Nashville, Tennessee

ONE OF the extremely valuable contributions made by
Nashville to the world is that made through her great
educational institutions.

Nashville has long been known as the 'Athens of the
South' before the Parthenon was first erected in 1897 as
the gallery of fine arts for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, celebrating the important event of Tennessee's full
century statehood in 1896. Built to last a year, the much
beloved building stood for nearly 24 years. The Board of
Park Commissioners had long had the idea of reproducing
the Parthenon in permanent materials. This was an ambitious undertaking, for a city much larger than Nashville.
But Nashville's work seven-league-boots and travels fast.
The old building was torn down in 1920 and in its site the
present reproduction of the Parthenon at Athens was begun. Its doors were opened to the public on May 20, 1931.

The original Parthenon, constructed in Athens, Greece
in 438 BC, was built to enshrine the Goddess of Wisdom.
Our Parthenon is an exact replica of the original Parthenon in
Greece; and we do hope in time to reproduce the immense
statue of the Goddess of Wisdom, in order that the replica
may be complete.

Nashville Parthenon differs in design in a few ways that
are necessary. There is artificial light overhead as opposed
to torches near the ceiling in the original. This is essential
due to our colder winters during which time the great
East doors must be secured. We have passageways from
the larger East room (Naos) to the West room (Parthenon). The Greek laymen were not permitted to view the
inside of this sacred treasure room. Our major difference is
in the material used in the super structure. The original

in Nashville is concrete re-enforced with steel which last
much longer. The statues are not the originals, the British
possess them, but these are cast from moulds of the
originals; they are 163 years old and minute in their
exactness. The original had a wooden ceiling, cedar from
the Cedars of Lebanon was used; here the cypress from the
everglades of Florida was chosen because it too is durable.

The most striking feature of the Parthenon when viewed
from any exterior approach is the Grecian Urn outlined
against the sky by Doric Columns and best viewed from
a point inside the Naos and through the East doors. The
two famous doors—largest bronze doors on earth—weigh
7½ tons each, under supervision visitors are permitted
to move these, even a three year old child can do so.
Embedded in the six foot walls are great steel hinges
weighing thousands of pounds.

The Greeks used their Parthenon for 900 years as a
shrine—they did not enter the temple. The Christians used
the building for 1,031 years as a church and the Moslems
used it for 200 years as a Mosque.

There is a basement in our Parthenon for the enjoyment
of the visitors, containing fine permanent art and contemporary work; it is not a part of the reproduction and
should not be interpreted as such.

Nashville Parthenon was financed by the people of
the city and its functions today under the authority of the
Board of Parks and Recreation. Around 800,000 visit this
great structure each year. The visitors come from fifty
states and from almost every foreign nation of this earth.
They are students of history and architecture. They are
people on vacation and school groups.

For information on available dates, rental charges, etc. contact Mr. Rice at Nashville Municipal
Auditorium, 417 Fourth Avenue, North, Nashville, Tenn. 37219. Telephone 747-4217 Area
Code 615

MR. FLOYD R. RICE was the first and only manager the Municipal Auditorium has had since it opened its doors, October 1962. And I might add a very dependable and capable manager. Mr. Rice was a veteran Nashville Theater manager. A native of Harman, he became connected with the theater enterprises in Nashville when he moved here in 1936 with the Crescent Amusement Company. His wide association with the show business made him extremely important to the fulfillment of our Auditorium's program which has been a major asset to Nashville's financial and entertainment life.

With the facilities in this $5-million structure, with a seating capacity of 10,000, our Metropolitan city has had conventions that were not able to accommodate before the opening of our Municipal Auditorium. Also trade shows, sports events, concerts, expositions, spectaculars. Its adjoining 500-car parking garage is truly an accommodation for Nashvillians and the public at large.

We wish to congratulate our Municipal Auditorium Commissioner, Mr. James H. Armistead, Vice President and Advertising Director of The News-paper Printing Corp., for winning national first place for promotion of a recent advertising series for the American Petroleum Institution. The first place plaque was presented to Mr. Armistead in New Orleans in January 1968, at the convention of the International Newspaper Advertising Executives Association.

Mr. Armistead said, "It is very gratifying for us at the Nashville Tennessean and Banner to have been selected as the number one newspapers in America. We, too, are very proud.

Kate Smith, March 15. This universally beloved lady with the big heart and big voice, who has sung before kings and queens and presidents, stands alone, on a peak of bright stardom that has rarely been achieved in the annals of show business. She is something rare in this age of automation and conformity—an original. It is perhaps a tribute to her stature and her individuality that, in the many years since she first became a star, no one has ever been successfully compared to her. Kate is in everyone's constant demand, and she adds continuously to her scores of millions of fans. She is truly a legend in American entertainment and she earned the right to wear the crown of America's first lady of song.

Peter, Paul and Mary will be at the Auditorium March 22. They have a certain something about them that all ages.

Ice Hockey, Feb. 24 and 25; March 2 and 9.

BULLETIN: This means you! Don't you think that Metropolitan Nashville can support a Convention Bureau? We have a population of 457,000 people. There are many cities with far less people that have very active Convention Bureaus. We should organize our own Convention Bureau in 1968. In can be done! Nashville wears seven league boots and travels fast! With your help and support we can accomplish this task!

As We Start A New Year...

... and approach the half way point in our fiscal year, I want to take this opportunity to thank the citizens of this community for their continued interest in local government, and call for public understanding of the problems we face—as public servants—on a day to day basis.

It is rewarding for me to be able to say the community has continued to show economic growth in 1967. I also call for a 'pulling together' of the total community, with full citizen participation in affairs of government. By working together and realistically facing local issues, we can have a great New Year.

Thanks to you members of the news media who have done an excellent job of presenting many of our programs. Your cooperation makes it possible for us to reach the public with issues which affect all of us. I'm grateful to you and look forward to all our efforts during the New Year.

Beverly Briley

MORE THAN 80,000 people from all over the Central South are expected to converge on Nashville Municipal Auditorium beginning Tuesday, February 13 for the 12th annual Great Lakes of the South Outdoor Show. It will conclude with a matinee show at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 18. Gates open each day at 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday; at 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

"There is no question in our minds that this will be the biggest and most varied display of boats, motors, campers and other equipment for the outdoorsman ever seen in Nashville," declared Bob Steber, show director.

In addition to the many merchandise exhibits visitors to this year's show will also see an all-new, top calibre stage show each night at 8 p.m. and at 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

The acts include:
The Pompoff-Thedy Comedy act, making its outdoor show debut; The Ascot Sisters; Willy Necker's amazing leaping Dalmatians - the finest dog act on stage today; Colonel Seabright and his amazing swag pole act; Dave Overton, popular WSM radio personality, will make his first appearance as master of ceremonies; and finally Jack Gregory and his show band will put music to Music City's top stage show.

Tickets are still the biggest bargain in America - only 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. The proceeds go to Sertoma charities. Advance tickets may be bought from members of the Nashville Sertoma Club and at a number of business establishments throughout Metropolitan Nashville. This great show is brought to you as a community service by The Nashville Sertoma Club and The Nashville Tennessean.

in Mayor Beverly Briley Home, which was about 4:45 PM Central Standard time.

At this time, I was served about 1 1/2 oz. bourbon whiskey, ice and water. I sipped this drink from an "Old Fashioned type glass" until about 5:30 when my glass was "sweetened" with the second serving of bourbon whiskey. This second drink did not look as strong as the first. At the dinner table, about 6:00 PM, I started sipping one wine glass full of rather dry wine. We began our dinner. During dinner, I sipped down the second helping of the same wine. I enjoyed a NICE DINNER. We remained seated around the dinner table engaged in conversation.

Around 7:00 o'clock, I was served an after dinner drink -- (Irish or Scotch Mist, I think the Mayor called it. ---- Since Mar. 3rd, I have not bothered the Mayor with questions concerning amounts or brands of liquor served to me.) A little while later, from the same tiny glass, I drank another after dinner drink of another brand. It was sweet tasting, not potent, and definitely was not absinthe.

I FELT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ALERT BY 8:45 PM !!!

As to my mentality, I would say that I run at least, a good average, being that I graduated in the top 1/4 level of my high school class. I attended 2 years of college before marrying.

In the 1940s, I became Girl Scout leader and served in that capacity for 8 or 9 years. I was also Girl Scout Neighborhood Chm. for Belcourt School, Nashville, for a number of years, I was a Nashville District Chm., Girl Scouts (volunteer work) and also served on the Nashville Girl Scout Council.

Around 1960, I became Den Mother to a Cub Scout Den and served in that capacity for 3 years.

Report
Not for publication

Sunday, March 3, 1968, the family, (Mayor of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County) some of the Briley relatives, George and I, had enjoyed dinner at the Briley home in Nashville. About 8:45 PM Central Standard Time, and I, left the house and walked to the parking lot where the three of us stood talking. I saw a light traveling in the sky a little above the southwest horizon. This light seemed only a bit larger and brighter than a star and it seemed about the same color as a star.

As I yelled to [redacted] to look, the light became brighter and larger. While I was observing this "traveling light" from a great distance away, it did not look to me that it was traveling in a flat trajectory. Rather, it seemed to travel in a slight arc and, at this point of flight, I began to note the "orangish-colored" trail of light behind the "star-colored" light.

[redacted] asked, "You know what we're seeing, don't you" talking was an annoying distraction to me while I was trying to listen for some sound, so I tossed loudly, "Hush with your mouth!" The three of us stood silent, almost motionless, and very much in awe as we realized that the "thing" was headed our way and was coming surprisingly near us! There were some leafless trees in the yard that partially obstructed our view for a moment. Then--- IMPACT!!!

The "impact" I am referring to is the impact on my emotions, for with breath-taking surprise, the "thing" was nearly overhead and seemed to be quite large and close! To be more explicit, the "thing" looked like it was headed directly over the far corner of the [redacted] houses! It was shaped like a fat cigar, in my estimation. I was impressed that it seemed of considerable size-- the size of one of our largest airplane fuselages, or larger. [redacted] thought it was smaller than my estimation -- It appeared to have rather square shaped windows along the side that was facing us. I remember the urge to count windows, but other details flashed

in view and my curiosity made me "jump to other observations." For an
instant, I thought I caught a glimpse of a "metallic look" about the fuselage,
and this really made me feel that the "thing" was close! (Later, [redacted] said
that he saw this "metallic look" too.) It seemed as though a faint light reflected
on the fuselage.(Perhaps the faint light came from the lights of the city or
from the lights of the "thing".) It appeared to me that the fuselage was
constructed of many pieces of flat sheets of metal-like material with a "riveted
together look." It appeared to me that the fuselage was not of smooth contour.
The many "windows" seemed to be lit up from the inside of the fuselage with light
that was quite bright. This light seemed to be about the same color as light
coming from the windows of our homes. I did not observe anything other than
the light in the windows. (It occurred to me that I might see objects or persons,
but there was too little time for a good look.) My rough estimate is that 2/3 or
3/4 of the fuselage near the front end had windows that were lit up. About 1/3
or 1/4 of the fuselage toward the rear end was dark or without lights. I did
not observe any blinking lights on the "thing" like we have on our planes. From
out of the back end of the fuselage came a wide (roughly about the width of the
fuselage) --- long, "reddish-orangish-yellowish" stream of dusty fire. It seemed
as though particles of dust were on fire. These tiny sparkles seemed to make up
the tail and the light from it seemed of quite low light intensity when compared
to the light emitting from the "windows."

I listened intently for some sound from the "thing" but I didn't hear even
a whisper of sound!!! This was the most eerie part of my whole experience!!
Certainly, there should be some sound from an aircraft that looked to be so near!!!
It flashed in my mind that perhaps the sound was yet to follow.

Then--- HULLABALOO! ---- We'll started talking at the same time! In the course of our expressionism, the conversation went something like this:

Someone: "It didn't make any sound!" [Redacted] "That wasn't a meteor, because a meteor doesn't have windows, but I'll be damned if I'll report it!"

"I'm not going to report it either!" [Redacted] "I'm not going to report it!"

(Laughter.) Someone: "Tremendous speed!" [Redacted] "What time is it?"

Looking at his watch: "Quarter to nine." [Redacted] "How high would you guess it was?" [Redacted] "Not more than 2,000 to 5,000 feet, or maybe lower. That thing was really low!" "What direction?" "Southeast to northeast."

[Redacted] "Whatever it was, it will be in the papers tomorrow." --------- As we excitedly compared notes, we agreed with each other on most of our observations.

This "agreement" seemed to comfort me, for I certainly didn't want to think that I had just experienced my first hallucination while I was wide awake! ---- All three of us agreed that we had seen something other than any plane we had seen or had read about from our Earth. We thought that we had seen a "craft of top secret category from our Earth," or that we had seen a "craft from Outer Space."

It was chilly outside and Mayor wasn't wearing a coat. Besides, our short discussion of the event seemed to suffice. It didn't seem strange that, so soon after, all three of us went back to our routine of daily living, for, after all, can't anything really surprise us these days in this scientific era?!

Most sincerely written,
[Signature redacted]

I was impressed with what looked to me like low altitude of the craft at this point of my sighting --- I thought, around 1,000 feet or less. Also, when the craft was flying near us, it did seem to travel in a flat trajectory.

I tried with the idea that it even slowed down somewhat -- for how else could we observe so much detail in a mere flash across the sky? (doesn't think it slowed down)

The craft was headed away from us now. I concentrated on the "fiery particles" that seemed to come from out of the end of the fuselage. I was expecting to see a bright ball of fire close to the fuselage end, but I saw no bright ball of fire. However, I noticed that the trail's light intensity did increase somewhat (Mayor noticed this increase in tail brightness too) but, this was understandable since we were looking at a denser view of "fiery particles", in other words, length of trail view instead of the previous width of trail view.

Because the flight pattern of the craft was at a slight angle from where we were standing, it was possible, for a brief moment, to see near the "fiery trail's end" and one or a few lit up "windows", simultaneously. Upon this observation, I concluded that there must be an outward bulge in the fuselage, especially after taking into account that there were no windows toward the rear end. Also, this simultaneous view of nearly full "trail light" and "one or a few --window light" gave me the opportunity to compare light intensities again. The light from the window or windows, seemed brighter than the trail light.

All too soon, the "thing" was flying away, low and over the treetops towards the northeast. I could see only the "orangish-colored" light of the trail now.

Certainly, SOUND would come from this craft!!! The three of us remained quiet while looking and listening. I was still expecting to hear noise, but, instead, there remained that unbelievable silence!!! The three of us remained quiet for awhile, even after the craft was well out of sight. We all were baffled by that SILENCE!!!

However inaccurate I may be, I have taken it upon myself to try to sketch the UFO as I saw it. The part of my sketch that I am the most unsure about is the windows. My "mind's eye" was far too slow to count windows, but I feel safe to estimate that I saw 10 or more. I would not state that these "windows" were exactly square or exactly rectangular, but I think that I saw "squared corners." A possible bulge in the craft's fuselage, the fast speed of the craft and my trying to observe fuselage shape and color, color of light and make up of trail, leaves me in quite a bit of wonderment about the windows.

Also, I was more interested in looking into these windows than I was in studying window shapes. However, I feel strongly that the windows had definite symmetrical shapes, were clearly outlined as the craft passes by and were lined up in a row horizontally. I feel safe to stress that the windows did not look blurred or fuzzy, but had clear, definite shapes. I observed, also, that the windows looked quite large -- I would say larger than the windows we have in our places.

Fuselage area was dark here so I didn't notice that "metallic look" here like I did around window area.

Dear Sir,

very good report.

I am sending you my observations of a UFO that was sighted in many parts of the USA on Sunday Night March 3, 1968.

I hope this information will be helpful in identifying the object or objects.

My observations are as follows:

1) Time of observation - 9:46 PM March 3, 1968
2) Place of observation - Oliver Springs, Tenn.
3) Duration of observation - Approx. 45 seconds
4) No. of Degrees Are observed over - Approx. 120°
5) Location of UFO - The UFO was first seen as it passed Tangent to the lower edge of the moon. The flight path appeared to be nearly at right angle to the Ecliptic as illustrated.

As the UFO moved east, it passed in front of the Constellation CASSIOPEIA, and disappeared in the vicinity between the head + Tail of the Constellation DRACO.


- page 53 -

Here is the text from the document:

5) Apparent Size - 1/4 to 1/2, the length of the diameter of moon at the time it was observed passing tangent to moon. As the UFO went to a point directly north of me it would have required the width of the adult hand held at arms length to obscure it from view. The width of the UFO could have been obscured from view by the width of one finger held at arm's length.

7) General Description - As the UFO passed tangent to the moon it looked like a jet aircraft climbing out with the after burner on. My first impression was that the object was a jet aircraft because there appeared to be a smoke trail that was illuminated by the moon. As the object moved east it appeared to get larger and the object also appeared to slow down to the point that my wife, son, and I thought it was going to stop. As the object got closer the fire cone at the rear of a cluster of brighter lights appeared to almost go out. From a point due North the object appeared to drift slowly for another 30 degrees, at which time the fire cone suddenly became much brighter and the UFO disappeared behind a hill. When the fire cone became much brighter at the time of disappearance the intensity of the fire cone was about equal to...

time of year.

the sky it appeared as illustrated.

no lights

Fire Cone
Orange red
in Color

Several individual lights
with white color like by Upper
light. These lights resembled
windows in an aircraft at night.

When the UFO was first seen the
fire Cone looked like the flame from the
after burner of a jet aircraft. The
white light in front of the fire Cone
were slightly brighter than the
North Star in magnitude. Between
the fire Cone & the white cluster of
lights there was an area of no lights.

2) Number of persons making these observations.
My wife, Three Children & Myself.

3) Background of this observer
(a) Profession - Electronics Engineering Aid.
(b) Place of employment - Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn.
(c) Worked 2½ years in Airborne
Instrumentation at Cape Kennedy, and
have observed many missile launchings.
I have also observed many aircraft
in flight at night.


- page 55 -

10) General comments- I have viewed
the skies for twenty years for
a so-called UFO and this is the first
thing I have ever seen that I
could not identify or explain to
my satisfaction.

During my observations I did not
note if any of the stars were
obscured from view as any part of
the object passed in front of them.

From my observation I could
not detect that the object constituted
any one solid mass. No form other
than the individual lights were visible.
This UFO did not behave as any meteor
I have ever observed.

I would appreciate being informed
of the outcome of the investigation of
this UFO.

Yours Truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]

Major Hector Quintanilla

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Last night, March 3, 1968, I stayed over night with my cousin. When I reached his house, he wasn't home but visiting his neighbors about mile down the road.

Well, I went in and made myself at home. Then about 9:45 P.M. I looked out the window and saw some kind of fire-colored object fly across the valley. About two or three minutes later my cousin, my aunt, and my uncle came running into the house yelling and trying to tell me about the UFO they saw. My cousin, aunt, uncle, and their neighbors, all observed it from horizon to horizon, which took but a very very short time. It was at about tree-top level and was seen very, very clearly, and was just a few yards away.

All of the observers saw a long jet airplane locking vehicle without any wings. It was on fire both in front and behind. All observers also saw many windows in the UFO. My cousin said, "If there had been anybody in the UFO near the windows I would have seen them."

It was standing on a tractor to get a better view of it when it got far away saw it turn south. The UFO was estimated to be 175-200 feet in length. We called local police [Indiana] to the police station and it had already been reported on the outskirts of Bedford. We were in the car and drove to Bedford to the police station and one else reported the had seen it turn south at Bedford and head for Salem (Indiana). Then the next morning it was supposed to have been a meteor. But the other five observers and myself know the UFO was not a meteor because meteors don't have windows and don't turn corners like IT did. And it didn't make any noise.

What so ever, I believe what we saw was a FLYING SAUCER.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

MEMO FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

[Redacted name] saw it at 9:45, estimate two minutes duration or could have been less. I first saw it 40-45 degs above the horizon SW-NW. Object would have passed almost directly over the airport, right over the roof. Disappeared 5-10 degs above the horizon. When first seen there were four particles, at the end I would only see one object. Thought it to be either a meteor or satellite breakup, had a pretty good glow. It was a glow like some gasses were following the object. The radar is sometimes. Did not call down to radar, because air traffic radar usually can not pickup this high of an object.

Called: Greater Cincinnati Airport
Control Tower

3 Controllers saw the object:
Mr [Redacted]
Mr [Redacted]
Mr [Redacted]

Mr [Redacted] sighting was taken down in pretty much detail.

Mr [Redacted] said that the object passed SE of the airport and that he saw it go out at about 70 degs elevation. The object was at about 30 degs elevation when first seen and went in a NW direction.

Mr [Redacted] saw the object for only about 10 seconds. He thought the objects passed nearly overhead although it may have been a little East. He watched the object till it faded out. Bearing 40 degs or elevation of 40 degs!

Subj: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

[Redacted name and address in Dayton, Ohio 45449]

[Redacted name] called to report an unidentified flying object that he observed at 945 pm on 3 March 1968. Mr. [Redacted] said he worked for the General Motors Corporation as a Supervisor and has been trained to make proper observations for analysis. He has never seen an UFO before. He saw three flying in a formation that he couldn't identify.

The objects were going very fast, there was no sound, it left a trail. The brightness was not consistent, it seemed that the two on the side were more consistent, appeared like a flame and was sparking. He lives in Singing Hills and saw the object go from the horizon in the SW to the horizon in the NE. Way up high. It was going a terrific speed. He compared it to a meteorite, however the observation was much too as long for that of a meteorite, saw it for one to two minutes.

He said that he often watches for the meteor showers. Mr. [Redacted] would like to complete an AF Form 117 on his observation.

Dear Sir:

On March 3, at approximately 9:45 pm - we were 25 miles west of Elizabethtown - coming in on the Western Ky Parkway, When we sighted a 'cigar shaped' object directly ahead - a little to the left of the North Star.

The object appeared to be vertically descending. When I first sighted it was brighter and as it descended it became more ghost like in appearance until it was no longer visible.

Hope this will be of some help to you.

Sincerely yours,

Captain
Unit Air Mines
Stapleton Field
Denver, Colorado

Dear Captain:

Captain John Morrison, whom I have met here at the Martin Marietta Corporation in Baltimore, has asked me to write you regarding a UFO sighting by me on the night of February 3, 1968.

I was flying a Lockheed JetStar at 33,000 feet and indicating Mach 0.82. The weather was clear with unrestricted visibility. A beam HUD a light was observed at three o'clock and higher than my flight. A guess would put it fifteen or twenty thousand feet higher. At first the light appeared to resemble a flight of two aircraft in trail. The light moved at a high rate of speed, at a steady course and altitude. My heading was 87° so I would guess his heading was about 50°.

As it passed at 12 o'clock, they definitely appeared as two distinct light sources. Each light source emitted that I would describe as a pencil beam of light. This beam had no taper, did not trail off, maintained a constant cross section and ended abruptly. I would describe it as whitish in color changing to phosphorescent. The changes in color were subtle and did not appear modulated.

When these lights moved to 1100 o'clock the front light seemed to be out-distancing the rear light. The rear lights at this angle appeared as two distinct lights of the same intensity and both also trailed by identical pencil beam of light. A few seconds later, it all disappeared from sight because of the distance from my position.

The time was approximately 1045 p.m. EST. My course was a doppler track from FWD direct to LRD. Drift was six degrees right. The total time this was observed was between 40 and 50 seconds. All this observation is as actually witnessed and my copilot concurs with everything as it is stated here.

DURATION: Approximately three minutes

Mr. and Mrs.        were in their car on Western Kentucky Parkway, approximately twenty-five miles west of Elizabethtown. The object did not disappear over the horizon, but over a hill. The object passed north of them and was traveling NE. Looked like a light on smoke. Mr.        was pretty sure that the object passed north of them; however, since the road curves he could say positively. He was pretty sure that it passed to the north.

Intensity:    Stated that was less intense than on aircraft red beacon light that he saw later that evening. Could not compare to Venus. Observer does not think the objects were either satellite debris or meteors because they had a flat trajectory.
He did not see any tail either but thought that there were numerous lights in random fashion.

The observer was flying over London, Kentucky, VOR at 10,500 ft (about 131 N miles South of Cincinnati VOR) whence first sighted the objects to the West at what appeared to be 18,000 to 20,000 ft. The line was 0946 pm EST and the object was in sight for about 8 minutes duration. When the objects passed in front of the observer they seemed to be at about a 60 degs angle with the horizon. One object was leading, several others seemed to be along-side, and one was trailing the others. The observer compared the sighting to lights shining on contrails. When first seen there were numerous lights but some of the lights went out after they had passed in front of the observer. After they had passed well beyond it seemed like after burners.

The course of the objects was at about a 75 deg heading. The objects just seemed to fade out of sight before going over the horizon.

March 3rd re-entry

Mr
University of Colorado
Boulder, Colorado 60102

Dear Bob:

Reference your memo of 9 July 1963. It has been my experience that a sonic boom, rumble, or a swish in association with the re-entry of a fragment.

The characteristics of the sound depend upon the shape and size of the object. Smaller fragments tend to make a swish, larger fragments a sonic boom. A larger fragment's sound can be heard within a fifteen mile radius, the smaller fragments, within a much, much smaller radius.

On the 3 March 1968 incident, we could find no evidence of anyone hearing a sound. The night was cold, and chances are that people had their houses fairly well insulated and there is also the best possibility that the re-entry fragments fell in a densely wooded area. Forest rangers in the Pennsylvania and New York areas heard no sound; however, we might be looking in the wrong place for the recovery of this fragment.

Thank you for the article; I will be looking forward to seeing you in the near future.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Lt Colonel, USAF

Hector:

I'm sure you've seen the attached by [redacted]. In case you haven't...........

I'm interested to know whether anybody who reported this thing suggested he heard a sonic boom? Would you expect that there ought to be a report of one? Of course, there is no lift associated with a re-entering object, and, from reading the literature on sonic booms, I conclude that lift is more responsible for sonic boom than volume. Even so, there would be a boom in connection with the Zond 4 re-entry. Maybe, for such an object, the path of the boom is very narrow, and you would not expect a report. What has been your experience in such matters?

Best personal wishes,

Cordially yours,

I compare this with meteorites, missile re-entries and satellites. I have seen and am certain while in none of these. I hope this information is helpful to you. I made a complete report to IND center and heard perhaps a half a dozen air carrier pilots make similar reports.

Drop me a line when you compare this and next time I am in Denver, I would enjoy a chat with you.

Flaming Objects Seen Many Traced to a Soviet Space Shot

By WALTER SULLIVAN

At about 9:45 PM Eastern time, reported seeing a craft with ra square windows and what seemed to be a riveted metal fuselage. The absence of sound terrified her, since she believed the vehicle to be only 1,000 feet overhead.

At about the same time, a woman in Indiana looked out a window and saw a procession of fiery objects fly past in the sky.

Two or three minutes later, she reported to the United States Air Force the next day, "my cousin, my aunt and my uncle came running into the house and yelling and trying to tell me about the U.F.O. (unidentified flying object) they saw."

"It was about treetop level and was seen very clearly," and was just a few yards away," she continued. "All the observers saw a long looking airplane vehicle with both my wings. It was on fire both in front and behind. All observers also saw many windows."

A woman in Ohio told how her dog, when the U.F.O. passed over, had hair between trash cans in her driveway and whimpered, "like she was frightened to death."

The woman, although she had slept 10 hours, said she had had "an overpowering drive to sleep." She had the same experience after seeing a U.F.O. in 1968.

In Tennessee, a woman re-

What she and the other witnesses saw, the Air Force believes, was the re-entry into the atmosphere of the booster rocket, or other launching components, of Zond 4, a space vehicle launched from the Soviet Union the day before. A study of Air Force files in Ohio showed it to be one of the most thoroughly documented — and revealing — U.F.O. episodes to date.

Moscow announced on March 7 that Zond 4 had been placed in a parking orbit until it would be in the proper position for launching into "outlying regions of near-earth space."

Some thought its task was to photograph the moon and return to earth, but apparently the mission was unsuccessful.

Yesterday the North American Air Defense Command confirmed its assessment that the fiery objects seen over the Eastern United States were debris from the Zond 4 launching. Meanwhile, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization continued on Page 10, Column 1

Flying Saucer I Traced to Space Shot by Soviet

Continued From Page 1, Col. 3

[Most of the first paragraph is partially illegible]

A study of this file illustrates the excitement that grips some observers when confronted with a U.F.O. However, it also shows that others, such as airline pilots, can help retrace what actually happened, particularly when their reports are sufficiently numerous to weed out those that are mistaken.

Included in the file are reports from an Eastern Airlines pilot over Connecticut, a United Air Lines Flight over Indiana, an American Airlines pilot over Pennsylvania, a Piedmont Air Lines pilot over Virginia and at Air Canada pilot north of Toronto.

Teletype-flight reports led the air traffic control centers of the Federal Aviation Agency in Washington, Annapolis and New York to search their radar scopes, but no satisfactory object beyond 60,000 feet could be detected.

At least two of those reporting to the Air Force guest book were convinced they had witnessed a century of a spacecraft. Most pilots, however, were perplexed by what seemed a formation flight of several vehicles. Most also thought the strange craft were only a few thousand feet above them, instead of near the fringes of space.

Such a "common flying" as a chunk of Sputnik 4, Other events typical of wandering "space junk" have been noted.

Yesterday, said Hayden Planetarium Astrophysical Observatory in procession of very objects Cambridge, Mass., realized what looked like "flying saucers," they refer to as the "Milwaukee space observers."

UFO, later identified as Soviet space debris is said to have followed trajectory of arrow-tipped flare, landing in area shown by cross.

Satellite-tracking teams had been alerted to watch for the fall of Sputnik 4 due to pass overhead at 4:56 A.M. The chances that anyone would see the plunge were considered slight.

Even minutes before he predicted pass a team member mounted a 36-inch telescope and saw a brilliant object approaching. By telescope, the object was seen few across the sky in process of falling.

Shortly thereafter a police patrol car saw a dark object, which later was identified as the white center-line of a street in Manitowoc.

Wis. It was almost too hot to handle and was soon identified.

In the incident on March 5, other fragments were tracked by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

Dear Sirs,

I am presently enrolled as a student at Bethany College, Bethany West Virginia. At approximately 9:30 m. Sunday night I was returning to my residence after leaving the Biology Laboratory I noticed two bright objects in the sky traveling at high speeds. It appeared as if one object was in pursuit of the others. One object seemed to be traveling at a higher or greater speed than the one pursuing it. The pursuing object appeared to have emitted two objects of lesser intensity, and looked as if it was making some attempt to shoot the other one down. The five objects then passed behind some trees and the approximate azimuth by which I was standing pointed the objects out to two fellow students, who were coming up the walk, if reference or witness be needed.


- page 142 -

Here is the text from the document:

By the time, I had gotten concerned
while out of the building, the objects
were out of view.

I have often noticed B-52
members of flying over Bethany numerous
times and so far as I know fly at
approximately 60,000 ft or about. The
grounds of these reports are audible, but
these objects did not emit any sound.
This is a diagram of what
appeared.

Subj: Satellite Decay

On March 3, 1968, between 9:45 and 9:50 pm, EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania area sighted several whitish to bluish white lights that appeared to have orangish-red tails. The majority of the reports were caused by portions of the recent Soviet probe ZOND-4. The objects appear to have passed between Pittsburgh and New Castle, Pennsylvania on an approximate northeast heading. The Aerial Phenomena Office is currently contacting airports, air bases, and police departments in Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts in the hopes of receiving UFO reports that will lead to the retrieval of this space debris.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                   4 March 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

TIME:    945 PM

DURATION:    1 Minute.

DESCRIPTION: Thought it looked like something burning up in space, three main objects in formation, however, I think there was something within the object, could only see the fire trails, yellow orange.

I didn't see them come across the horizon, I stopped the car and got out, watched it before it disappeared over the horizon. The object seemed to be coming in from the atmosphere but it didn't lose any altitude. They were in formation, one out in front of the other. This is what caused me to look more closely because of the fire, its was huge, trails of fire were huge, they kept a constant speed. Thought it looked like a burn in. I was about 20 miles from Cleveland.

FIRST SAW:    30 - 45 degrees elevation, traveled in an easterly direction.

MEMO FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968 (2145 EST)
Between Ft Wayne and Columbus

The Major was flying at about 6000 ft headed SE between Fort Wayne and Columbus. The object appeared to his right and passed in front of his craft.

Duration: only a few seconds

Color: pretty much a white color similar to fuel being jettisoned.
Was about 70 to 80 deg above the horizon and was seen in the SE skies.

Comments: very reliable reports.

Duration:  3-5 seconds

Course:    NE

First seen: at angle elevation of about 60 to 70 degs as it dropped below cab of control tower NE of the base.

Disappeared: disappeared before it got to the horizon.

Comments: Although the observer did not see it until it dropped below level of tower cab. He thought it would have passed North of Lockborne AFB and South of Columbus, O.C. A. at Lockborne and Port Columbus tried radar but did not pick objects.

Also said that Port Columbus reported at that time that a couple of pilots (in flight) reported the objects. Previously to this conversation that I had with Sgt Bossler I talked to Columbus Control Tower and they stated at that time that they had received no reports.

[Name redacted] saw a UFO and said he didn't know how to describe it.
It seemed to be "V" shaped, like three jets in formation. I didn't
think it was jets because the last two were too close together, left
a stream of smoke across the sky. Was sitting in a drive in theater
on Rt 49 at the time of the observation. Object was going West to
East. I didn't think much of the observation until I heard about it

D--- saw an object at 951 pm for 75-85 second, it seemed much longer but it probably wasn't. She made sketches of the object.

Saw it through field glasses and when it was looking up it first appeared like a meteor or comet. I always take my field glasses along when I let the dog out. Saw one object and it was coming straight down at 80 deg arc, was rapid speed but then as it got closer to the horizon it slowed down, then it suddenly became three. It was not a falling star because of the colors. Orange-white-red-orange. Similar to the color of the sun. They flew in a perfect military formation.

The object was flat and the bottom had a protrusion, moved very slowly in a NNE direction. I have four college degrees and I'm not nuts, I teach science. I was afraid of getting the camera for fear I would lose the object and I want the objects to come and see us.

There were no sparks, just a vivid red-orange tail. Coming straight down and disappeared behind a house. D--- flashed a flashlight at the object in morse code, SSS and then again four times to the object.

Also her dog is afraid of the cold and so he crawled behind the garbage cans and layed down and whined. D--- wanted to fill out a form and send her sightings to us.

ZOND 4 DEBRIS REENTRY OF 1968 MARCH 3

On this date at approximately 9:48 p.m., E.S.T., a rather brilliant object appeared. Being reported to one of our active A.M.S. members, Glen Wells, at University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky., he at once had a fireball questionnaire published in a local paper. Due to this, reports came from many people. The writer at first assumed that it was a fireball with time of visibility greatly exaggerated, but as all reports showed a great duration it became evident that it was something unusual. Soon thereafter Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio sent a large number of reports which had come to them. And [redacted], at Denver, Office of United Airlines, sent a number of reports from pilots. Later Professor V.D. Chamberlain, Abrams Planetarium, East Lansing, Michigan, sent several reports and a key one came from Sky and Telescope. Eventually over 60 were available from all sources. Only with this prompt and efficient assistance, which is most gratefully acknowledged, could this solution be made.

It was obvious that this case could be handled by the same methods we use for fireballs. Hence the usual chart was prepared with all stations plotted thereon and the azimuth lines to sub-beginning and sub-end points drawn. Each such solution presents its peculiar difficulties and, in this, it is that too many stations lie quite near the vertical plane of body's motion. For some it actually crossed


- page 183 -

zenith. Hence an excellent direction of motion and azimuth of the
radiant is obtained, but determining the heights are more troublesome
as few usable reports came from well to the side. Fortunately, the
report from S48, Oliver Springs, Tennessee, by [redacted] of Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, is most complete. His diagram shows that
the object grazed Moon's lower limb. As we already had the path's
azimuth this gives an excellent height near the beginning point. We
were even more fortunate in that Professor J.F. Phillips, Florence State
College, Florence Alabama, was using a 6-inch telescope pointed to U
Persei, and had the body cross its field. This we take as the beginning
point. The two corresponding heights are 74.0 km and 74.2 km
respectively. We assume therefore, that H1 is 74.1 km. For the end
point at 372, Hubbard, Ohio, [redacted] and [redacted] gave
an excellent drawing of the path on a star map showing that it ended at
E Bootis. This gives H2 as 37.6 km. The average of 5 other altitudes
which seem reasonably good also gives H2 as 37.6 km. So we assume H2
was 37.6 ± 13.1 km. There were numerous other estimates of altitudes
but many observers were so near the vertical plane of the path that
the slightest error in azimuth would affect the heights greatly. Some
even referred the path to certain stars, we take the projected path
length as 1122 km. Due to the excessively small inclination the true
length can be assumed as the same. It is quite possible that the body


- page 184 -

became visible before seen at 569, and the end point is even more
liable to error due to the original two bodies disintegrating into
many, so persons at different distances would see a different end.
However, the 1122 length and the given H1 and H2 fully define the
coordinates of the atmospheric path.

Observers in general reported a practically horizontal path.
Some furtherest south reported two objects and that, as the object
continued on it broke into more separate pieces, until near the end
it became practically a "shoal" of fragments, moving in parallel paths,
many times as long as broad. No long enduring train was reported.

As to brightness, it certainly was much less than full Moon, but
several reported it as brighter than Venus. It showed a definite
disk. There was more than usual agreement that the color was white-red.

As to the velocity in our atmosphere, we have 28 estimates running
from 6 sec. to 6 min. The estimates are complicated in that some saw
only part of the path, also that nobody had a stop-watch, and for
durations of over 10 seconds estimated durations are subject to great
errors.

About this time, I was informed that the Space Defense Center
was predicting the decay of debris from Zond 4 into the atmosphere for
the time and along the same ground trace as observed for the problem
in question. Since the velocity would have been on the order of 5-7


- page 185 -

km/sec no further calculations were performed. This velocity would have corresponded to a time of approximately 3 minutes which was well within limits of the actual observed time.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Since writing you in regard to a probable error in the orbit I sent you, I have given considerable thought to the matter. In fact, the corrections for curvature and zenith distance are so enormous, thatthe tables for the latter are far from accurate when the object's radiant is practically on the horizon, and the longitude distance from apex is so great,as in this case. Also what you are interested is the path in the atmosphere. The heliocentric orbit I tried to calculate had no reality, and was indeed a waste of time. Also with corrections to radiant's position so great, in any case it would be most uncertain.

In view of these facts, I am asking that you destroy page 3 of my original paper, and substitute enclosed page 3. This will in any way make the paper less use for your purposes, and I, on mature consideration, will feel much more comfortable when the uncertain and wholly hypothetical orbit is suppressed.

I regret troubling you with these changes, but the present form will be much more suitable, and less likely for criticism.

Most sincerely yours,

Dear Colonel Quintanilla;

Following my last letter of a few days ago, I have recomputed the orbit of the March 3, 1968, object, putting in the curvature correction with the proper sign. Fortunately it does not change the text in any respect nor the atmospheric path, only the last 6 lines need change with data on the orbit. I will now put the figures in as they should be:

Radiant corrected                a 52° h -7°
                                  R.A. 58° Decl. - 32°

Parabolic orbit:   Inclination                18°
                   Long. Ascending node       164°
                   Long. Perihelion           327°
                   Perihelion distance        0.93 A.U.

I regret the necessity of having to ask that you make the corrections, but fortunately they are at the very end.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

This morning I was working on the July 2 fireball and was about to put the corrections for altitudes in.

To my disgust I suddenly remembered that I had put it in, with wrong sign, in the orbit I sent you, so please hold paper up until you receive the corrected orbit.

Fortunately this error I made does not affect the atmospheric path at all nor the discussion of that, but as soon as you get to the astronomical path, the error changed the altitude, and this will change the coordinates of the radiant, and the parabolic orbit.

As I believe you do not plan to publish until after 1969 begins, the delay should not be serious-at least I hope not. I will try to do the recomputing within the next week or ten days and get it off to you. As said, only the astronomical part is general discussion in the paper. Only from the radiant coordinates on, will changes be necessary.

I naturally regret this, but for some years now do all my work alone, and have no one to check what I do. This inevitably leads to some errors, which are not at once found by me.

Sincerely yours,

Narberth, Pa. 19072

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

The enclosed copy of the paper prepared at Wright-Patterson and based on the one I submitted, is herewith returned. I caught two minor errors and inserted one comma, which make the meaning clearer. I do not know whether my name should be inserted at top or bottom of the article, but that I leave to your discretion. Otherwise it meets with my approval.

There is one matter I left alone but will state my position. I always write Earth, Moon and Sun in capital letters. Then I am treating them as astronomical bodies. If we write Venus and other planets with capitals why not? The word "would" then be left out. In this frankly I go against American custom and follow the English which I consider more logical. In writing or rather mentioning American history I'll cite items dealing with astronomy for the Encyclopedia American, under two editors but not the less identified on using small letters, and as it was he who paid me, I had to unwillingly agree. The quoted American nut critics and dictionaries. I admit I erred for neither.

However, your writers doubtless wish to follow American custom in the matter, and as they had changed my capitals to small letters, I did not protest.

Please do not send me any more recent data, as I do not think it worth while to do more of them.

With regard to the July 2 fireball, the data you kindly sent me have been of greatest value. With what I already had and a new batch from Chamberlain, the solution will I hope be complete. In the near future.

Your cooperation in sending fireball data has now in many cases permitted the solution of their paths and orbits and I trust it will be continued to our mutual benefit.

Very sincerely yours,

Satellite Sentry of 1968 March 3

On this date at approximately 9:48 p.m., S.T., a rather brilliant object appeared. Seline reported to one of our active A.S. members, Glen Wells, at Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky., he at once had a fireball questionnaire would had in a local paper. Due to this provoke came from many people. The writer at first assumed that it was a fireball with time of visibility greatly exaggerated, But as all reports showed a great duration it became evident that it was something unusual. Soon thereafter Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, O.io, sent a large number of reports which had come to them. And H.M. Smith, at Denver, Office of United Airlines, sent a number of reports from pilots. Later, Addoms Planetarium, Scott Lemmon, Mich., sent several reports and key ones from Sky and Telescope.

Eventually over 60 were available from 11 sources. Only with this prompt and a ficient assistance, which is most gratefully acknowledged, could this solution be made.

It was obvious that this case could be handled by the same methods we use for fireball. Hence the usual chart was prepared with all stations plotted thereon and the azimuth line to sub-beginning and sub-end points drawn. Each such solution presents its peculiar difficulties and, in this, it is that too many stations lie quite in the vertical plane of body's motion. To some it actually crosses the zenith. Hence an excellent direction of motion and azimuth of the radiant is obtained, but a determining the height are more troublesome so far usually reports come from well to the side. Fortunately, the report from SMO, Oliver Springs, Tenn., was Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is most complete. We find that the object passed down to the body's lower limb. As we already have the path's azimuth this gives an excellent height near the beginning point. We are even more fortunate in that Prof.

elted. Deviation of the path on a star map shown that it nods at 6 Bootis.
This gives H2 as 37.6 km. This average of 5 other altitudes which seem
reasonably good also gives H2 as 37.6 km. So we assume H2 was 37.6 ±1.1
km. There were numerous other estimates of altitudes but many observ-
ers were so near the vertical plane of the path that the light error
in azimuth would reflect the heights greatly. Some even averaged
the path to cast in stars. We take the projected path length as 1122 km.
Due to the excessively small inclination the true length can be resumed
as the same. It is quite possible that the body became visible before
seen at 889, and the end point is even more like to error due to the
curl incl two bodies disintegrating into many, so persons at different
distances would see a different end. However, the 1122 length and the
given H1 and H2 fully define the coordinates of the atmospheric path.

As to the velocity in our atmosphere, we have 23 estimates run-
ning from 6 sec. to 6 min. Throwing out two impossible ones of 4 and 6
min., the average of 26 gives 76 sec. Again dropping those of under 26
and over 90 sec., 13 estimates give 69 sec. Using the unusually full
reports from 889 to sec., 848 to sec., and 970 to sec., the mean would
be 49.3 sec. With this the observed velocity would be 23 km/sec, and
from a vector diagram, the heliocentric velocity 56 km/sec, which is
most improbable. The estimates are complicated in that some are only
part of the path, also that no body had a stop- tch, and for durations
of over 10 seconds estimates are subject to great errors.

Observers in general report a practically horizontal path. Some
further set south to point to 6 objects and that, as the object went up
on it broke into more separate pieces, until near the end it became
practically a "shower" of fragments, moving parallel with, very timey,

ness, it certainly was much less than full moon, but several report-
ed it as b.i brighter than Venus. It showed a definite disk. There was
more then usual agreement that the color was 'white-gr'. More recent-
ly Wright-Patterson Air Force Base informs me that the object was
the end of a Russian ZOND satellite.

Though obviously the object did not have a heliocentric orbit
yet from curiosity such a possible one is computed. The corrections
to the observed weight are extremely large as will be seen. The orbit
follows:

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

Your letter of July 2 reached me yesterday, and I am replying without delay.

Such calculations as the one of the satellite of Jupiter which we normally have to wait here for the preparation and the 1968 Annual Report of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Just now, from the experiences of recent years, this could not appear before July. And there is another personal compilation which might make its appearance even more in next year. And so my working days may come come to an end at this time, though so far I have been very fortunate.

Therefore if you can publish the article for the Blue Book which you say would appear in March or that would be Jan. I could still use it in the 1968 Report.

The actual finished article is in my desk at U____, and I will probably not get these until middle of next week, being done in Philadelphia, some distance away. But then it can be mailed to you and kept there until Blue Book is prepared. Meantime was the tabular data for any purpose.

The actual sub-end point, due to the disintegration of the meteorite, but I consider the direction of the very accurate as such thing go. So a search or inquiries along this line might turn up some valuable information.

Thank you again for all the valuable reports given from Wright-Patterson which, among other things, made the situation in mission possible.

Sincerely yours,

1. Reference your letter of 24 June 1968, regarding the satellite decay observations.

2. We are very interested in your solution to the trajectory and impact points for the 3 March 1968 debris. However, the Book will not be published until March or April 1969 and it would probably be more timely to have your solution published in the astronomy periodicals. If it would be possible, we request your permission to use your solution as an addendum to the Book and also to include part or all of it in the official record of the sighting.

3. If you would send us a draft of your calculations we may be able to contact police and other agencies in the area to determine if anyone heard or saw anything that may be related to us.

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

At last I have made
a full solution for the atmospheric path
of the 1968 March 3 object, which I have
mentioned been informed was the recovery of
a Russian ZOND satellite.

Also for idle curiosity I have made
a solution of its orbit, as if it was helio-
centric.

As so many of the reports came from
your office, I am wondering if you would
like to publish this solution in the next
Blue Book? It would be about the equivalent
of some 800 words of text, at a guess.

This merely a suggestion, as such
publication may not be feasable due to re-
gulations etc. But I thought you should have
first choice. I have nothing on the 12 April ob-
ject of which you asked.

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

Very many thanks for the "Translation on Chinese Meteor Showers" which I was just come and hurriedly looked over. I do not have it and am most happy to add it to our A.M.S. Meteor Library. It is very interesting.

Incidentally, it is too bad that their so-called government is so hostile to us, as I am quite old enough to remember how after 1900 the U.S. was the best friend China had and gave them back all the money they paid for damages.

I have a path worked out for the March 3/4 Object, on which you sent me a large file of valuable reports. But for the first time in my life I cannot off-hand decide if it was a meteor or reentry of a satellite. It came at 9:46 E.S.T. March 3. If you have a reentry listed for that date, please let me have the data. Also I am at work on the fireball of 1968 19/20, seen at 8:55, C.S.T. over general region long.44W lat.37N.

Three reports came in from pilots, sent by Roth in Denver. Do you by chance have any report(s) on that? If so, they would be most valuable.

Again thanking you for the Chinese Translatic,

                                                Most sincerely yours,

Subject: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

Conversation with Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Office of Information, indicated that: [redacted location in Pennsylvania]

had observed an unidentified flying object on the night of 3 March 1968. The following brief description was given: Three lines of fire with ill defined speed of jet and at the horizon broke and an disappeared at the horizon. Three long lines of fire traveling, NNE. Pittsburgh said that the gentleman had worked in control towers previously and was sure his description was accurate. We attempted to contact [redacted] on the phone, however, he was not in and will call us on 6 March.

On 6 March 1968 Mr. [redacted] called the Aerial Phenomena Office. He saw the object on the night of 3 March 1968 at approximately 945 pm. near upper St. Clair, Mt Lebanon, which is a suburb on the southside of Pittsburgh. Mr. [redacted] said that at first there were three objects, the one broke into the making a total of four objects, the objects were then colored, like a bright flame. They were heading from the south to north, mainly NNE. Was facing south at the time and the objects were south of him. The objects came pretty well out of the 35%. Mr. [redacted] first noticed the objects and they were like small 14 and he thought they were possibly exhaust but then they became elongated so that he didn't think they could be an afterburner or the exhaust like that which occurred from a DC-7. Seemed like to main ones tall could cover the length of a mile. The objects, didn't pass overhead, passed south of his position at about a 45 degree angle. They almost blocked out the two bottom stars of Cassepra. When the objects disappeared in the north they were flying almost in perfect echelon. Had a very flat trajectory. When the front one broke into two the others more or less seemed to shorten, break up and disappear. It disappeared at an elevation that Mr. [redacted] could have been from a mile if they would have continued. The visibility was excellent that night. Mr. [redacted] had been a control tower operator previously. Lt Marano told him that he thought Mr. [redacted] observed a satellite decay.

Aerial Phenomena Office

Dear Sirs,

This morning our local paper carried a request for a sighting of a "UFO" on March 3.

On that date at 10:10 PM my husband and I saw a large falling fireball in the southern sky at approximately 45° from the horizon. It was a large fireball with a long tail and it wavered in its path as if the object could be rolling.

I saw it as it started to burn and called my husband across the room. It lasted about forty five seconds and burned out as we watched. There was no sound.

I have been watching for a request in the papers because I did not know where to send such information.

Yours

The objects came over the horizon and after about 50 degrees elevation), the leading object appeared (still) in the SW at about 50 degrees elevation). The leading object continued and disappeared after passing beyond the car (due north at about 80 degrees elevation). When asked about direction she replied that the objects were to her west going north.

MEMO FOR RECORD

8 March 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 8 March1968 (1005 hours)
Sevart AFB, Tenn.
AV 882-1500

Talked to Lt Col Fitzhugh. The only report that he has for 3 March 1968 is at 7:45 CST. The observer saw very bright Light going East. Saw it for several seconds. The Observers name:

Sgt T. Bishop
61st Tactical Sq.
Duty Phone: 2168
Home Phone: 893-7679

1110 hours Sgt Bishop called back and his sighting was not a sighting of a debris. Probably saw a satellite going over.

1015 hrs, talked to Nashville Control Tower (Municipal Airport) 225-7788. They had a few calls that they channeled to Sevart AFB. Base Operations: 215. Since I have already talked to Col Fitzhugh I did not think that it was worth the effort to call base operation at this time.

Dear President, I can be expected when true local people call Copernicus Hill. We sighted one on the U.F.O.'s

There were two white lights that were, on staged, in the same motion (please calculate light line). I certainly saw my fiancée in my car some distance line off time were convincing lines. I would have from the fuselage of a B-52 only about 30 & 40 lines (-up?)

UFAF117

March 3, 1968

Dear Sirs

I am presently enrolled as a student at Bethany College, Bethany West Virginia. At approximately 9:30 pm Sunday night I was returning to my residence after leaving the Bultoff Laboratory. I noticed two bright objects in the sky traveling at high speed. It appeared as if one object was in pursuit of the other. One object seemed to be traveling at a higher or greater speed than the one pursuing it. The pursuing object appeared to have emitted two objects of lesser intensity, and looked as if it was making and attempt to shoot the other one down. The four objects then passed behind some trees and the gymnasium by which I was standing. I pointed the objects out to two fellow students, who were coming up the walk, if references or witnesses be needed.


- page 276 -

By the time I had gotten around the side of the building, the objects were out of view.

I have often noticed B-52 bombers flying over Bethany numerous times, and as far as I know fly at approximately 40,000 ft or above. The sounds of their engines are audible, but these objects did not emit any sound.

Here is a diagram of what appeared.

I will be glad to offer any more

UDPF (UFO) Maj Quintanilla/70915/mhs/19 Apr 68
UFO Observation, March 3, 1968

1. Your letter of March 4, 1968 to Dr. Keto has been received at the Project Blue Book office. Fortunately, in this particular instance, we were able to obtain enough accurate reports so that the identity of the three fiery objects were quickly verified. We received reports from Indianapolis, Richmond, Dayton, Xenla, Columbus, Pittsburgh, and some small towns northeast of Pittsburgh.

2. The Space Detection Center, at Colorado Springs, was aware that a piece of satellite debris was reentering our atmosphere and was especially vigilant during this time. Because of visual observations, such as yours, the computer was updated and it was determined that the "target impact point" (TIP) was in either northern Pennsylvania or southern New York if the fragment survived reentry. We have not been successful in recovering the fragment, but we are hoping that it will turn up when people start hiking in some of the off beaten trails in that area.

3. On behalf of the Air Force, let me thank you for submitting your report to Project Blue Book. Your report will be added to our satellite reentry behavior data base.

SUBJECT: Reported Sighting - UFO

TO: FTD (Dr. A. J. Cacioppo - TDGS)

1. The attached letter from Mr. Charles W. Ingler of the National Cash Register Company is self-explanatory. Also attached is a clipping from the Dayton Journal Herald of Thursday, March 7, 1968.

2. I am submitting this material to you since the reported sighting has a broader implication than a normal UFO. It is apparent that the objects were space objects with their behavioral character being of particular interest.

3. I know [redacted] very well through many close community associations with him over the past eight to ten years. He is the Director of Community Relations for NCR, and highly professional in the areas of government (national, state and local), political science, organizational and business administration. I consider him as one of the most capable individuals that I know - outstandingly articulate, keen judgment with a rare and creative talent for resolving organizational and complex administrative problems. He has degrees of BA and MA in Government from Oklahoma University, and has done additional graduate work at Northwestern. He is of unquestioned integrity and a very staunch friend, close associate and supporter of the Air Force.

4. I have discussed [redacted] sighting with him. His principal interest in reporting the sighting is to provide his observations as to the maneuvering character of the objects and not as just another UFO report. Recognizing that the characteristics of the sighting correspond to a large degree with the probability that some type of space objects were observed, it was his desire to bring the particular maneuvering aspects of such objects to the attention of the Air Force.

5. The following particular points were brought out in the discussion with Mr. [redacted]

a.     Contrary to the article in the Dayton Journal Herald, the objects were moving northward instead of east.

b.     As described in his letter and as brought out in the discussion, the objects changed course, first northwestward and then back toward the northeast.

c.     The direction of his travel by car on I-75 was essentially straight and northward. Although change in the direction of his travel was admitted as a possible reason for observing an apparent maneuver in the travel of such objects, his reaction was that any recognized curvature in the section of I-75 being travelled at the time of the sighting would not account for the maneuver.

d.     Curvature noted in the tails extending back from the objects would correspond to the observed maneuvering.

e.     The spatial relations of the objects were not observed to change in such maneuvers.

6.     I am bringing this matter directly to your attention for reasons of overall FTD interests in the implication of the maneuvering characteristics of the objects observed.

This appears to be a meteorological map or weather chart showing various atmospheric conditions across a geographic region. The map includes:

- Latitude and longitude lines
- Multiple "FREEZING" labels at different longitudes
- Numerous numerical annotations representing temperatures, pressures, or other meteorological data
- Curved lines representing weather fronts or pressure systems
- Geographic references like Prince George, Edmonton, Grand Forks, and other location names
- Isobar or pressure lines marked with numerical values
- Circular symbols with numbers around them, possibly indicating weather stations or specific meteorological measurements

The map covers a region that appears to be primarily in North America, spanning from approximately 105° to 140° longitude and including parts of western Canada and the northwestern United States.

This appears to be a meteorological map or weather chart showing various geographical locations across North America, with numerous numerical annotations and curved lines representing what seem to be pressure or temperature contours. Visible locations include:

- Hudson Bay
- Island Falls
- Churchill
- North Platte
- Oklahoma City
- Atlanta
- Rapid City
- Pierre

The map is marked with latitude and longitude lines, ranging from approximately 115° to 75° West longitude. There are multiple "ZERO" markers on the edges of the map. The map is densely populated with numerical values, likely representing meteorological data such as temperature, pressure, or other atmospheric measurements.

The map appears to be a detailed weather or atmospheric conditions chart, typical of those used by meteorologists and atmospheric scientists in the mid-20th century.

EXPLANATION OF THE

Weather maps are one of the principal tools used by the weather forecaster. Of the several types of maps used, some portray conditions near the surface of the earth, while others depict conditions in various heights in the atmosphere. Some of the more Northern Hemisphere maps used for daily forecasting by the Weather Bureau are similar in many respects to the printed Daily Weather Map. A Weather Bureau meteorologist can quickly analyze these maps and prepare a forecast. Maps are published daily. Maps of upper level temperatures, pressure, and humidity are prepared. More each day. A new detailed reproduction of weather maps is published daily for forecasting." U. S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, 1962.

PRINCIPAL SURFACE WEATHER MAP:
To prepare the surface map and plot the information quickly and pictorially, we use certain abbreviations and symbols. (1) Weather observers at many places send coded messages by telegraph, teletype, or radio. (2) These coded messages must be quickly transcribed by hand on the map, and (3) the information must be quickly transferred for plotting, analysis, and forecasting.

PLOTTING:
A great deal of information is condensed into a small space on the map. The code permits the transfer of a large amount of data around a point in the use of the code.

The rest of the text continues in the image, but due to the complexity and length, I've provided the most legible and complete sections. The document appears to be a detailed weather observation and forecasting form with various symbols, cloud abbreviations, and weather description codes.

Dear Sir,

To add to your file on the March 3rd sighting of Zone IV.

This was clearly visible from my front lawn - frightened my 11 year old son. Lance was cut & his Telescope - & was very interesting to me. The ball of fire was very large + unlike a meteorite. The object appeared to slow down & float as it burned. There was no sound.

Flaming Objects Seen by Many
Traced to a Soviet Space Shot

By WALTER SULLIVAN

At about 8:45 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on March 3 a woman in Indiana looked out a window and saw a procession of fiery objects fly past in the sky.

Two or three minutes later, she reported to the United States Air Force the next day, "my cousin, my aunt and my uncle came running into the house and yelling and trying to tell me about the U.F.O. [unidentified flying object] they saw."

"It was at about treetop level and was seen very very clearly and was just a few yards away," she continued. "All of the observers saw a long jet airplane looking vehicle with- out any wings. It was on fire both in front and behind. All observers also saw many windows in the U.F.O."

A woman in Ohio told how her dog, when the U.F.O. passed over, had lain between trash cans in her driveway and whimpered. "like she was frightened to death."

The woman, although she had slept 10 hours the night before, said she had "an overpowering drive to sleep." She had the same experience after seeing a U.F.O. in 1966. In Tennessee, a woman re-

ported seeing a craft with rather square windows and what seemed to be a riveted metal fuselage. The absence of sound terrified her, since she believed the vehicle to be only 1,000 feet overhead.

What she and the other witnesses saw, the Air Force believes, was the re-entry into the atmosphere of the booster rocket, or other launching components, of Zond 4, a space vehicle launched from the Soviet Union the day before.

A study of Air Force files in Ohio has shown it to be one of the most thoroughly documented — and revealing — U.F.O. episodes to date.

Moscow announced on March 3 that Zond 4 had been placed in a parking orbit until it would be in the proper position for launching into "outlying regions of near-earth space."

Some thought its task was to photograph the moon and return to earth, but apparently the mission was unsuccessful.

Yesterday the North American Air Defense Command confirmed its assessment that the fiery objects seen over the Eastern United States were debris from the Zond 4 launching. Meanwhile, the Aerial Pho-

Flying Saucer Is Traced to Space Shot by Soviet

Dominion Office of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio had assembled some 70 eyewitness accounts of the episode.

A study of this file illustrates the excitement that gripped some observers when confronted with a U.F.O. However, it also shows that others, such as airline pilots, can help reconstruct what actually happened, particularly when their reports were sufficiently numerous to weigh out these that are misleading.

Included in the file are reports from an Eastern Airlines pilot over Connecticut, a United Air Lines pilot over Pennsylvania, an American Airlines plane over Pennsylvania, a Piedmont Airlines pilot over Virginia and an Air Canada pilot north of Toronto.

Their in-flight reports led the air traffic control centers of the Federal Aviation Agency in Indianapolis and New York to search "with radar scopes, but no unidentified objects below 60,000 feet could be detected.

At least two of those reporting to the Air Force questioned that they had witnessed the object. A 93-cent telescope mounted on a bar nearby was used to track the object's approach.

Shortly thereafter a police patrol car saw a dark object embedded in the white center line of a street in Manassas, Wis. It was almost too hot to handle and was soon identified as a piece of a satellite.

Such a "formation" flying typical of unidentified reports was tracked at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., recalled what they refer to as the "Milwaukee Miracle" early on Sept. 5, 1962, one of its Moonwatch teams

identified as Soviet space debris is said to have followed trajectory of arrow-tipped line, landing in an area shown by cross-satellite-tracking) teams had been alerted to watch for the fall of Sputnik 4 which had overheard at 4:58 A.M. The chances that anyone would see the plunge were considered slight.

His office has been phoning police barracks throughout the suspected impact area in a search of further clues. Astronomers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory said yesterday that a careful search will be found in that area, much of which is forested.

A number of reports on this episode came from motorists, including business executives, and other well-educated observers. Several ruled out an explanation that the object was phung during the object's course in mid-flight. This may have been an illusion caused by motion of the observer.

Almost all were impressed by the silence of the flight, almost none reported a sound like that of a tin sheet being thrown.

In the southwest, another grass fire occurred in his neighborhood the next day and suggested a possible association with the U.F.O. visit. A science teacher, who said he held a doctor's degree, reported trying to see the U.F.O. with a flashlight.

Many of the pilots' reports were cited by H. B. Roth of the Air Lines office in Washington, project director of the National Investigations Network of U.F.O.'s.

Despite the March flurry, a probing report of the U.F.O. situation, according to Colonel Quintanilla, in Washington yesterday, showed the sharp decline of sightings this year. A report reaching the Air Force headquarters yesterday, the monthly rate of a year earlier, in Washington, was down to 15 sightings.

A University of Colorado study of the phenomenon, directed by Dr. Edward U. Condon, is being drafted and should be released by the end of this year. It is an attempt to assist the phenomenon from a scientific point of view.

Reports Decline

Despite the March flurry, a
puzzling aspect of the U.F.O.
picture this year, according to
Quintanilla, is the sharp decline in reports. In Washington
this year, they are reaching
the Air Force roughly one-quarter the monthly rate of a
year earlier. In Washington yesterday, the headquarters of the
National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena
said that it, too, had seen a
sharp decline from a year ago.

There was also a slight drop
in 1966 and 1967.

In 1966 several much-publicized U.F.O. episodes in Michigan and elsewhere apparently
stimulated further reports. As
those that fell on Wis-[hard received 156 reports since
Jan. 1. Of these 21 were attributed to space objects, 105 to
astronomical objects, 19 to aircraft, 10 to balloons, 5 to car tractiles and 22 to other known
causes. There are 56 cases
pending that have not been
identified.

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla:
Two letters from you March 18 and another extended to in this letter.

First; object of 1967 Oct.27- Report from Blytheville, AFB, of an object sighted between 0616 and 0622 CDT. I have two reports on that date of a bright fireball, one from St.Joseph, MO, at 6:37 CST, one by a pilot at Long. 78°56'W, lat. 50°N at 0615 CST.

The first observer from St.Joseph, MO saw it tell vertically on bearing 405. The first observer from Cepheus to Andromeda or to north. Due to large difference in longitude, it could hardly have been same object. Neither fits the Arkansas report for date given there are right.

Second; report by pilot for 1968 Feb. 25 20:02 CST. His report fully fits description of a brilliant fireball, specifically, and without hesitation I would so classify. I have no other report of this object. If you can get the report of the PSZ pilot, mentioned in your note of Feb.26, I might be very glad to get it, as then I might be able to compute its approximate path.

Third; unknown object of 1968 March 3 at somewhere near 9:40 p.m., CST, from Kentucky and Tenn. etc. I now have about 8 reports. They all could be classed as fireball reports but for one thing; the duration seems about 200 to 120 second, most about 1 minute. Such a duration seems impossible for a fireball, so the lowest velocity one can strike the Earth's atmosphere is 7 miles/sec. I was disposed to think the first 2 the reported simply erroneous, such a duration, but later independent reports confirm the unusual duration. So it is not a fireball, so far as I can see. I know that you have reports in my hands. Please let me have copies of them so its path can be computed as we have here a most unusual object.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]

AF Identifies UFO's

Unidentified flying objects (UFO's) sighted in the Dayton area Sunday night have been tentatively identified as space debris.

An Air Force spokesman in Washington yesterday said the debris resulted from "satellite decay."

Further investigation of the objects sighted about 9:20 and Space is being carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The UFO's appeared as three objects, moving east with flames shooting out the rear, according to some witnesses.

MEMO FOR RBCG:                                                   5 March 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

Between 0945 and 0950 pm EST numerous observers in the Indiana, Ky., Ohio, and West Virginia area sighted several whitish to bluish white lights that appeared to have orangish red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were 3 (three) objects and that they were traveling in a NE direction. The objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis FAA Center was notified at the time of the sighting but did not paint any objects that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were quite certain the sighting was the result of the decay of Space debris into the earths atmosphere.

THE NATIONAL CASH REGISTER COMPANY
DAYTON, OHIO 45409

March 4, 1968

Dr. John E. Keto
Chief Scientist
Aeronautical Systems Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio 45433

Dear John:

I have the impression that Project Blue Book often has some difficulty in ascertaining whether a UFO sighting has come from a credible witness. Hoping not to add to your many problems, I must submit the narrative below to you, in the hope that you will pass it along to the responsible authorities; and I shall depend on you as the first witness as to whether I am insane, or highly imaginative, or otherwise unreliable.

At approximately 9:30 p.m. Sunday, March 3, 1968, I was driving alone northward from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Dayton, Ohio, on Interstate Route 75, at a speed of approximately 65-70 miles per hour. Due north and directly ahead of me I sighted three objects which, so far as I am concerned, pending some plausible explanation, were Unidentified Flying Objects.

These three objects were flying in a more or less perfect formation, with one substantially in the lead and the other two close together, side by side, at the rear. When first sighted they were at approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal surface on which I was travelling. The objects appeared to me to be flying at extremely high speed and at a very high altitude. I could not ascertain, with absolute certainty, whether they were flying horizontally or whether they were descending; but the angle of sight with reference to the horizontal surface of the earth was steadily reducing. Therefore, considering that I was behind them, and considering their speed, they could have been flying horizontally or they could have been descending, toward the horizon.

The sky was quite dark. I could not ascertain the shape or size of the objects themselves. The only reason for my being able to see them was the fact that a long golden tail extended back from each, flaring outward from a point at the front. The foremost point of each tail presumably was the object itself, which I could not see at all.


- page 356 -

Dr. John E. Keto                   2                   March 4, 1968

I watched these three objects in flight for approximately five minutes. I watched intermittently in order to be able to continue to watch the road and drive safely. At the end of that time, after a period of watching the road and traffic around me, I looked up again and noted that the three objects were no longer in sight.

Two characteristics of these objects interest me especially:

(1) The tail extending back from each object was distinctly golden in color, and therefore was unlike the jet stream following any jet engine or rocket engine I have ever seen before.

(2) The three objects, flying in a consistent formation, executed a distinct curve in their flight path. This was unmistakable: the lead object first entered the curve, swinging out toward the lead (west) horizon; and then the following two objects together entered the same curving course; then the three of them straightened out again toward the north-northeast. At one point in this trajectory, each tail was, itself, curved, and so this flight pattern was unmistakable.

I should appreciate it if you will pass this information along to Blue Book, with any comments you might care to make. If it should be useful to the Air Force in any way, I should be glad to reconfirm these details in an interview.

Many thanks, and best wishes,

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

SUBJECT: Satellite Decay, 4 March 1968 (1240 hrs)

We are quite certain that this is a piece of debris from the USSR launch ZOND-4 which in the most recent launch. It, the debris, was about 16 minutes ahead of the main pieces of the launch. We have no visuals, but are putting ground trackers on it. Al Waters, from SAO, had reports from Louisville, Kentucky.

Lt Barlett suggested that we state that it was debris without reiterance to origin. However, if asked directly, we could certainly tell them that it was degree from ZOND-4 and that it was of Russian origin.

Dear Sir:

This letter concerns my witnessing the U.F.O. sighting last Sunday night.

While crossing the bridge over Winton Lake south of Greenhill, I noticed a light that appeared to be a large star moving toward us from the west. As it came closer I sensed that this was not a plane. There was a cluster of lights, four to six in number, unevenly spaced with trails similar to comets. I re-asked the 1st cab driver to pull to the side of the road so I could get out for a better look.

By this time the cluster was directly overhead, slightly south of the Earth moving rapidly. The lights and trails did not dwindle or waver. They remained on a steady course to the east. The cab driver and her eight year old daughter watched these lights with me. They kept moving to the east and gradually disappeared over the horizon.

I am a person who has amateur experience in stars and night time skies. I do not think this was a meteor. I am sure it was, as the Air Force contends, the beginning of a space flight.

For what it is worth this is a copy of a letter I sent to the above addressed after some comments by hand on local T.V. concerning the sighting.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                5 March 1963

Subject: UFO Observation, 3 March 1963.

Lt Marano spoke with Captain Shea, SAFOIP at 1300 hours regarding release of information on the UFO report of 3 March. Captain Shea informed Lt Marano that the whole question on the release of the information on this sighting was coming more and more complicated.

He said that NORAD is reluctant to say that this is a piece of Zond -4. NORAD won't buy the fact that it is positively ZOND-4. Kitchee from NORAD doesn't want to say this. Lt Marano informed Capt Shea that Lt Barlett had said "We are quite certain that this is a piece of debris from the USSR launch ZOND-4 which is the most recent launch. It, the debris, was about 16 minutes ahead of the main pieces of the launch. We have no visuals, but are putting ground tracers on it. Al Waters, from SAO, had reports from Louisville, Kentucky." Shead said he would say that to DOD.

He says they are having problems with NASA and Kitchee. Lt Marano gave Capt Shea the following short brief description that could be used in place of the previous release given to Shea earlier today.

"On March 3, 1963, between 9:45 and 9:50 pm, EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania area sighted several whitish to bluish white lights that appeared to have orangish-red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were three objects travelling in a northeast direction. These objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis FAA Center was notified at the time of the sighting but did not paint any objects on radar that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were certain that the sightings were the result of the decay of space debris into the earth's atmosphere, and it is believed that these objects may have
