    U.S.A.

October 15, 1962

Dear Sirs:

On the night of September 18th 1962, I was going or borrowing my brother's car from A. Schultz when something unusual happened on our local street. A strange object was moving about in the sky, I believe out on G. street. I could not see it very well, but it was bright.

I was about to looking for the nearest telephone to call Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to report what I saw, when the object was moving over the western horizon. Then it was right about in the center of the sky. It was continuously moving, some of the lights would "black out" and then come back on. It was moving at a high rate of speed.

I am enclosing a sketch of a ball-like object held at arm's length. It was about the size of a dime at arm's length. It was white or silver in color, and it had a plan, and it's still lights, and it's wing lights.

The object took time for me to see on the homework, but I timed it to have crossed the entire sky in about 2 minutes, somehow, but I was watching.

Yours Sincerely,
[Signature section blacked out]

The image appears to be a scanned document with multiple columns of text. However, the text is extremely small and blurry, making it largely illegible. While there are clearly rows and columns of printed text, I cannot confidently transcribe any specific words or phrases due to the poor image quality.
