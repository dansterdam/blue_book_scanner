The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a letter from the "Dept. of Unidentified Flying Objects Pentagon Building" in Washington, DC. The letter discusses the writer's personal experience observing "red lights moving very slowly over the hood" and a "cigar shaped-rocket like" object. The writer states that they "will try to copy what I saw on a paper" and concludes with "THANK YOU".
