Here is the text from the document:

I was walking into my room and looked out of my window and saw a large yellow light. Then it slowly started to turn. Then a cloud came and the light disappeared. Then I went outside and saw the light again, only it was round. Then it started getting wider and there was a tail on it. Then clouds covered it and where the light was the clouds were growing and the light went away.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved lines to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. When you first saw the object, place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass.
