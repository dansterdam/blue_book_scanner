Belmar N.J.
Feb. 20th, 1965;

Air Force Intelligence:
Dear Sirs:

The enclosed sets of pictures were snapped by me as I sat in my automobile on the days of February 2nd and 3rd, 1965. Two sets were made while parked at "Wreck Pond" in Spring Lake N.J. And the other was snapped at Monmouth Airport.

Perhaps the Air Force would be good enough to examine the photos and let me know just what they are if possible? These things were clearly visible in the skies as they passed by, and were also visible to the naked eye.(At least to my eyesight)..

I am also enclosing a self addressed envelope so as you can return the pictures to me after examining same. If you care to make your own duplicates, please do so.

Thanking you in advance!

Sincerely,
(teacher of)
