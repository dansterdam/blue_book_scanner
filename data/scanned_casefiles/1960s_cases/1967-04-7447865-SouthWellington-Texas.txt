it occurred at a small airport and the duration was one and one-half minutes. Followup should have been made to determine other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at night on December 28, it is possible that there were no witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified, witness.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds. Witness was a 67 year old lady. Sighting occurred at 9p.m. day, saving time in the middle of August, and thus the sky was still have been reasonably bright. Witness said slight sighting at night and sky very blue. Perhaps she thinks that anything after 6 p.m. is night. Must be listed as unknown (meager data, single witness, very short duration).

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire. I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my return of a copy of the Air Force investigation of same. Based on NICAP report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the card on this case, but judging from there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was caused by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it

independent of official Project Blue Book business. The very involved and I feel must be classified as psychological hoax unless other data turns up to change this, which I think is unlikely.

In synopsis form: because of my interest in any possible photograph, I called of Wellington, Texas, and had a long taped interview with him. He sounded simple and straightforward, in fact so simple that I felt a contrived hoax would be beyond his capabilities. The pictures were sent up and examined by Mr. and me. We noted nothing on the picture to suggest that it was not a hoax. We did not spend too much time in any detailed analysis.

I had also taken the precaution of calling the sheriff of Wellington and getting a rundown on. The sheriff described him as living, with his wife, in an isolated section of Texas, as a cotton farmer, and as a man that knowledge of photography whatever. The sheriff volunteer information that - to make a long story short - the man not too bright, and from his standpoint alone a photograph hoax seemed unlikely. He volunteered, however, that if a hoax were involved, Mrs. would be the more likely engineer of such a hoax.

Shortly thereafter two reporters from Amarillo called. Apparently the story had leaked and had told them he would have no story for them until he had confirmation of the pictures from me. This, of course, he never got. I told reporters how I felt, but that they might have a good story in the perpetration of a hoax if they looked into it. And following my suggestion, had a lie detector test administered to Mr. This he flunked and he was generally discredited in the papers, as is well known. I then had a phone call a commercial artist from his ranch some distance from both Amarillo and Wellington, to tell me that he had earlier become interested in this case, and himself had hypnotised Mr. In order, as he put it, to get more information, and to see whether the information given under hypnosis was the same as given consciously by Mr. This unsolicited phone call surprised me but I considered it just another one of the oddball things in this oddball case.

Shortly thereafter, I learned that Mr. [REDACTED] had said something
that the whole thing was a hoax, that he had been put up or set up
under hypnosis by this very artist-hypnotist who had called him up
some days earlier. The story then went something like this...

The hypnotist had appeared out of a clear sky (maybe I shouldn't use that expression in this context!), had given [REDACTED] the set of pictures, one of which included the head of the purported occupants of the craft), and under hypnosis given Mr. [REDACTED] the story he was to tell later. By this time I wanted nothing further to do with the case, but I wasn't very happy. One of the original reporters called up, incensed, and asked whether I couldn't get the Air Force to prosecute this hypnotist for unethical practices, etc., he having made a dupe of [REDACTED] and subjected him to public ridicule. I told him that first of all the Air Force did not prosecute in such cases, and that furthermore in such instances it is the Air Force party who brings suit and that I hardly thought that the Air Force or I had been injured by the purported hypnotist's actions.

This would seemingly have ended it, except that I discovered that the hypnotist when he had first called me, had mentioned just in passing that he had done some work with the physics department at the University of Colorado (no connection that I ever with the Condon Committee), and had mentioned a [REDACTED] took his Master's Degree with me a good many years ago at Ohio State University. I thought someone might be interested in his order. This I did and was surprised to learn that the hypnotist (whose name I do not recall at the moment, but the entire story is on tapes which I can have my secretary transcribe if needed) has a daughter that had worked for the past year or so, and the himself had written the studio and home of the artist and only part-time hypnotist. He could not conceive that this man could have perpetrated such a hoax and made such a dupe of Mr. [REDACTED]. In fact, he considered it improbable in the extreme.

I relayed this information to the reporters, largely out of a sense of duty, since they were rapidly losing interest in the case. But the sequel to this was that [REDACTED] then changed his story once again. He now stated that he had finished the lie detector test, on purpose, but on his way to take the lie detector test, his car had been accosted by two men who scuffed him up and warned him that if he passed the lie detector test, he would never make it home alive. I do not know whether it is possible to deliberately flunk a lie detector test, but the fact remains that he did.

The puzzling thing about the entire case is how Mr. [redacted] came into possession of the rather remarkable color polaroid photographs. What were the circumstances under which the photographs were taken, and how were they contrived? Somebody went to a fair amount of trouble, but why? I questioned both the sheriff and asked the reporters to attend and also, whether Mr. [redacted] was ever known to have sought photographic supplies in the local stores, and whether he knew anything about photography himself. The reply to this as far as could be determined, was negative. If one had the time, this would make a very interesting, but not terribly significant detective story. I would suggest it as a psychology master's degree thesis.

It should be pointed out that the [redacted] sighting was by no means the only case reported in that area. There followed quite a spate of reports, apparently all through the year, and even as late as November 3, 1967, when a [redacted] made a typical long encounter, luminous body sighting. "It was big enough to drive a car in", [redacted] said, "it was shaped like a cigar - one end was round.

I believe there is a moral to be drawn from the Wellington case. Had the Altus AFR Force Base reacted promptly and done a good investigation on this case, very early in the game, and in particular, had found out how Mr. [redacted] had come into possession of said pictures, a lot of later trouble could have been saved. We still don't know how the pictures came into being.

21. 2 April 1967, Shively, Kentucky.
The evaluation "possible aircraft" seems okay. The sighting fits a pattern of the unusual, but we do not know how much the young boys "read into" what might have been a perfectly ordinary sighting. They are familiar with UFO literature and could have given a highly preferential interpretation to their sighting. The sighting was of short duration and the telescopic sighting was 20 seconds or less, hardly enough time to make a cold appraisal at a time of high excitement. Proper investigation at the local level could have easily determined how much of this was interpretation and how much was fact.

22. 3 April 1967, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The evaluation "aircraft" on this is ludicrous, if any credence whatever is given to the sanity and reliability of the observer. If it was an aircraft, then it created in the mind of the observer an entire fantasy, because as the observer stated, "there is no object I ever seen similar to this object I saw. Or could even compete to it."
