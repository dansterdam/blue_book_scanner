35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting: I only saw a totally dark object hovering about 500 feet in the air over a mountaintop, approximately 2 miles away. It was totally dark in color and not reflecting any light. It seemed to be oblong or elongated in shape. It was hovering motionless for about 3-4 minutes, then suddenly shot up at a very high rate of speed and was out of sight in 2-3 seconds. I have seen numerous airplanes, helicopters, etc. in this area, but this was definitely not any type of known aircraft. It was totally silent and did not seem to have any lights or markings of any kind. There was no noise or exhaust visible.

MICHIGAN: Personnel at the Air Force base in the UP western peninsula reported "solen lights connected with seven to eight obiects which hovered over the base for nearly an hour and were 8,000 to 12,000 feet high. They were 2,000 to 3,000 feet in diameter. The obiects were first sighted by an officer at 8:15 p.m. and remained until 9:15 p.m. They were seen by many other personnel on the base who were requested to identify them, but were unable to. They were not flares, but were hovering in a formation, moving east, then west, then hovering again. After about an hour they moved off to the south, slowed to a stop, then accelerated and went off. UFORC Tulsa Office investigated.

"YO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
1 AUG 196a
Claim: AES, Harrison

Dear Sirs:

The President has asked that I reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects. This reply is made to the press release which you enclosed in your letter. The Commander of the Ballistic Air Force Station in Michigan has stated that he was on duty on 5 August 1965 and that no unidentified flying objects were tracked on radar. There was no report made to this extract:

We have not yet received the evaluation of the sightings' data reports. This will be interpreted to show that the unidentified objects picked up or tracked on radar have been analyzed as flocks of birds, weather phenomena, or reflections from ground targets.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects. This report will provide you with information on this program since its origin in 1948.

I will be happy to offer assistance in providing this information to you.

Sincerely,"

BA DARING INTO THE 1963 1963 ON THE EVENING OF 7 AUGUST 1965 OBSERVED OBJECTS VISUALLY AND BY RADAR WHILE DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 101 TOWARD SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA.

THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE WHILE HE WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 101 APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES NORTH OF THE SAN RAFAEL TURNOFF. HE FIRST OBSERVED THREE BRIGHT OBJECTS HOVERING OVER THE HIGHWAY AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 2500 TO 3000 FEET. THEY APPEARED TO BE ROUND, BRIGHT SILVER IN COLOR, AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VOLKSWAGEN BUS.

WHEN HE FIRST OBSERVED THEM, THEY WERE HOVERING AND THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST. HE ESTIMATED THEIR SPEED TO BE IN EXCESS OF 1500 MPH. THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS.

HE CALLED THE SAN RAFAEL POLICE DEPARTMENT ON HIS CITIZENS BAND RADIO TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AND REQUESTED THAT THEY CONTACT NEARBY HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE TO CHECK IF THEY HAD ANY RADAR OBSERVATIONS TO CORROBORATE HIS VISUAL SIGHTING. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT LATER ADVISED HIM THAT HAMILTON AFB HAD CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD TRACKED UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON RADAR AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND LOCATION AS HIS VISUAL OBSERVATION.

Mrs. Hunt/man/SAFOICC/7282/3 Oct 63
Dear Mr. Malarhr, Florida, vid submit this file to the Air Force for anal:'sis. The file was analyzed at Harris air Force Base, Florida. The results of the analysis indicated that the film did not contain evidence of any unidentified aerial object. The film appeared to contain normal aircraft activity.
I talked with Doctor Hyner about the newspaper article you inquired about. He indicated that the newspaper story did not have any confirmed factual support. He could not have made such a statement to him. If you find out more information on this matter, we would appreciate your letting us know.
With regard to the alleged radar UFO report from the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Doctor Hyner had stated that he was on duty on a day in question and no such report cane to his attention.
I checked around and found no confirmed data about the radio show you mentioned. Any statements WEAL contains a tape would appear to be without foundation.
I am happy to be of assistance in providing you with this information.

DEAR SIR:

One of the most interested constituents who is very much interested and has been following the subject of unidentified flying objects.

He refers to a UFO release from Houghton, Michigan, reporting that the Air Defense Command there reports that 12 to 15 objects were sighted over Duluth and jet interceptors gave chase. 

It is stated that the report said the objects were moving out of the southeast at a rate of 1700 to 1800 miles per hour. And they were sighted over Duluth and jet interceptors gave chase.

Your comment on the above will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

3. EVALUATION: SOURCE HOWINY RZESZOWSKIE
7. SOURCE: POLSKA Press NOWINY RZESZOWSKIE
SUMMARY: Describing article translated from NOWINY RZESZOWSKIE giving account of phenomenon sighted on August 26, morning over Lidava Demo area (near Krakow). Two peasants reported observing a shining disc-like object over the horizon for 5 minutes. The object disappeared suddenly in a loud explosion and flashing lights. Explanation of the phenomenon, as given by V. Guth, the director of the Astronomical Observatory of the Czech Academy of Sciences, is that the object was likely a satellite fragment returning to earth in disintegration in the upper atmosphere. Another explanation by the same scientist is that it could have been the flight of the "Echo" satellite. He does not believe in "flying saucers".

NO CASE: Information Only SIGHTING REPORT DAVID R . EWING NOV-DEC 65 6 AUG 63 Ambleside, England

Next came two or three persons, said to be "in space suits," who got out of the craft and proceeded to inspect it and then go back in again. This incident took place at about 2200 hours on July 28 in the Lake District itself. This area is very well known and is a popular tourist resort. The night in question was described as being a fine summer's night with a full moon, and the observers claim that the craft was in view for some twenty minutes. It gave off a "shimmering light" and was about 50-60 feet in size. They reported that the craft appeared to land and then take off again, and the observers stated that they were greatly disturbed by the incident. We have the observers' written statements, and they seem perfectly reliable and responsible people. They have given a very detailed account of this incident, but as the case concerns reports of space-suited figures, we have been unable to obtain any photographs or other corroborative evidence. A full report has been forwarded to the Ministry of Aviation, and the DEFE records show that they have received a similar report from the observers.

Output of the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass to show where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
