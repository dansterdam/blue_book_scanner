MICHIGAN: Personnel at the Air Force radar base in the Keweenaw Peninsula reported "Solid radar contact" with seven to ten unidentified flying objects moving in a V formation over Lake Superior on Wednesday, August 4, 1965. The UFO's were moving out of the southwest at 9,000 miles an hour and were 5,200 to 17,000 feet high. Seven other UFO's were spotted over Duluth and jet interceptors gave chase, but were easily out-distanced.

TULSA, Oklahoma: A formation of "17 or better" unidentified flying objects were observed by a group of Tulsa church goers on a Sunday about 12:30 p.m. "They were moving fast, then they stopped, then they would go a distance, then they would go a distance, then stop, then change color slowly from white to green to red," then they went on.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

4 AUG 1965
Calumet AFS, Michigan

Dear Mr:

The President has asked that I reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects:

Reference is made to the press release which you enclosed in your letter. The Commander of the Calumet Air Force Station in Michigan has stated that he was on duty on 5 August 1965 and that no unidentified flying objects were tracked on radar. There was no report made to this effect.

We have not yet received the evaluation of the Wichita radar report.

You will be interested to know that all unidentified objects picked up or tracked on radar have been analyzed as flocks of birds, weather phenomena, or reflections from ground targets.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects. This report will provide you with information on this program since its origin in 1943.

I am happy to be of assistance in providing this information to you.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Mr. Malabar, Florida, did submit his film to the Air Force for evaluation. The film was analyzed at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. The results of the analysis indicated that the objects depicted were defects in the film. The film has been returned to Mr. Peek.

I talked with Doctor Rynek about the newspaper article you inquired about. Doctor Rynek does not know Fred Hobson; consequently, he could not have made such a statement. If you find out who Mr. Hobson is or who he works for, we would appreciate it if you would pass this information on to us.

With reference to the alleged radar UFO report from the Kewanna Peninsula in Michigan, the commander of the Calumet Air Force Station, Michigan, has stated that he was on duty on 5 August 1965 and that no unidentified flying objects were tracked on radar. There was no report made to this effect.

I checked around and found out about the radio show you were on in this area. Radio station WMAL obtained WMAL contract and used it on 24 September 1965. It has been returned to New York.

I am happy to be of assistance in providing you with this information.

Dear Sirs:

I am in receipt of an inquiry from one of my constituents who is very much interested and has been following closely reports of unidentified flying objects.

He refers to a UFO release from Houghton, Michigan, reporting that the U. S. Air Force Radar Base in the Keweenaw Peninsula had a "solid" radar contact "with up to 10 UFOs flying V Formation over Lake Superior. It is stated that the report added the objects were moving out of the southeast in a NNE direction at about "9,000 miles per hour." The report also states that seven objects were sighted over Duluth and Jet Interceptors gave chase.

You comment on the above will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

Ambleside, England

Ambleside

Next came the first widely-publicized case in the Lake District itself.
This incident took place late in the evening of August 6 just before midnight. The witnesses included the Sunday Citizen (August 8), and the Yorkshire Post and Daily Express (August 9) told stories of a young couple who had witnessed their first UFO - a cigar-shaped object with golden revolving windows, the whole glowing ferry red. There were reports too of sparks and disturbed cattle. We are indebted to reader Jack Dean for his efforts to locate the couple, and to interview them on our behalf. The following is his account:

"Michael Dean, and his girl friend I (Mollie Petherick, both of Bradford, Yorkshire) were nearing the end of their holiday in the Lake District. After reading the account in the Yorkshire Post, I traced the hotel where they had been staying, but I received little help in that quarter. I eventually ran them to ground in Bradford. I taped an interview at my home.

"The hotel at Ambleside contains of a main Guest House and a cottage - some distance away in the grounds. After a farewell party with other young people at the cottage, Mr. and Mrs. Dean, after 11 p.m. to walk back to the Guest House. They were some way ahead of the others when suddenly they heard a low droning noise, like a farm tractor. About 100 yards from a very heavy load, Bullocks at a nearby farm started to kick up a din, which extensive search was made, but nothing was found.

"Some newspaper reports that sparks were observed, but this was not true. Neither was the description of Mr. Dean as an airfield worker, for he works in a Bradford office.

"It transpired that BEFORE Mr. Dean had already spoken to Mr. Dean, and showed him illustrations of various types of UFOs, both he and Miss Petherick settled for the Darbishire saucer as being the nearest
