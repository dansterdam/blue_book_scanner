Scorpion Shines in South
A total eclipse of the sun, visible along a path about 100 miles wide from Ottawa, Canada, and Maine, July 20, is the astronomical event of the month.
By JAMES STOKLEY

WITH THE COMING of the summer season, the southern skies come to the fore. And foremost among the stellar attractions this month is the scorpion, Scorpius, the largest and most conspicuous of all the southern constellations.

This celestial scorpion, now well up in the southern heavens as darkness falls, contains the first-magnitude star Antares, a wonderfully ruddy star that marks the scorpion's heart. Antares, which means "rival of Mars," is so called because of its reddish hue, similar to that of the planet Mars.

Around Antares and the other bright stars of Scorpius are clustered a number of fainter stars that outline the scorpion's outline fairly well. The sting in the tail is particularly well marked.

The eclipse will be seen over a wide area, though the path of totality, where the sun is completely obscured, extends only about 100 miles wide. The eclipse will be total along a line running from about Ottawa, Canada, to Houlton, Me. Outside this path, the eclipse will be partial, with the moon covering only a portion of the sun's surface.

Those within the path of totality will see the sun's bright disk gradually obscured as the moon moves steadily across it. For a brief period of up to 2 1/2 minutes, the sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, will be visible, surrounding the black disk of the moon. The stars will come out, and the landscapes will take on a strange, eerie aspect.

The eclipse will be visible in the late afternoon sky. It begins in the northwestern United States shortly before 5 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, and ends in the northeast about 7 p.m.

The next total eclipse of the sun visible in the United States will not occur until July 11, 1991. Those who fail to see this year's event will have to wait over a quarter of a century for the next one.

The eclipse map shows the areas where the eclipse will be visible, with the path of totality indicated. The symbols for the stars at the lower right indicate their relative brightness.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

This time on the eastern horizon looking toward the northwest, you may get the chance to see the waning crescent moon just as it becomes eclipsed. After another hour or two it will move out of the umbra or total eclipse and you may observe it shining normally again.

The corona, or crown, of the sun is very difficult to observe except during those rare, few minutes when the moon completely covers the sun's disc. At such times, the solar prominences, which appear as crimson streamers flaring out from behind the moon's edge, can be seen glowing with the red light of hydrogen. Sometimes delicately colored solar clouds and filaments are also visible in the corona. But within a very short time, the sun's brilliant surface again outshines these phenomena.

This eclipse offers an excellent opportunity to observe the solar prominences as they appear in their full glory. By the use of special telescopes and photographic techniques, a great deal of scientific data may be obtained concerning the physical nature of the sun's atmosphere at the time of the eclipse. Special preparations were thus made to take advantage of this event.

Attention: U F 0 Section

Gentlemen:

At the suggestion of a gentleman at the Air Force Information Center, I am writing to you regarding a phenomenon observed by me and five others in Scarsdale, N.Y. on July 31, 1963.

At approximately 8:45 o'clock in the evening, the six of us observed a bright light in the sky above my home. The light appeared to be approximately the size of a thousand feet in diameter and was moving very slowly in a northerly direction. It appeared to be illuminated from within and seemed to glow as if made of a silvery material.

The object was stationary like two objects joined at their bases. As it moved overhead, it appeared to be approximately the size of a thousand feet across. After it passed over us and moved out of sight, we all saw it suddenly disappear as if some kind of screen or curtain had been drawn across it. We have not found anyone else in this area who also observed it.

I would appreciate any information you could give me in regard to this phenomenon.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,

(Mrs.———————)

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a text document describing unexplained craters found on a farm in Scarsdale, New York on July 20, 1963. The text provides detailed descriptions of the craters, including their size, shape, and location within the farm.

Unexplained Craters In Scarsdale

On the 20th of July, 1963, farmer Roy Blanchard of Scarsdale, New York, was mowing his farm. The news of the discovery was carried in the press throughout the United States with newspaper coverage. The craters and their features had their first observation during mowing operations by Mr. Blanchard.

Condition Anthony Penry had observed the craters which remained since the discovery on July 20, 1963. The larger of the two was found, and at 6 a.m. on the following morning, July 21, 1963, Leonard Dickinson, the farmer's son-in-law, was summoned. He went with the farmer to examine the craters.

Manor Farm, near Blanchard's, heard of this phenomenon. We begin this description by state that they are not and cannot be established for any evidence on which they are related to the crater, as it is described which no one may have seen but Mr. Blanchard.

The physical description of the site: The central portion was three feet wide with a smaller depression around this center. The large depression was a circular area which was depressed but not dug out, and this middle section was about four feet long and a foot wide. The depth was about a foot and a half to 2 feet, and the edges were sharp and distinct, with a definite rise from the surrounding terrain. 

Beyond the large depression was a circular area about 20 feet in diameter which was lower than the surrounding terrain. The vegetation in this section appears to have been somewhat discolored. And a foot-wide, gentle swale extended from the larger depression in a southwesterly direction for some distance.

The large crater was located in a potato field, and the three trenches in adjacent fields appeared to be somewhat related to the large crater. In the area of these disturbed plants, there appeared to have been some discoloration, appearing to have been "sucked up" by something.

According to the NASA Journal (Levittown, Pa.) whose sources of information were Mr. Blanchard, and Mr. Charles Sucklead, three other persons observed the craters.

CRATERS
(Continued from Page 1)
Several of surface vegetation were found later. One was under a sod in the field placed for an apparent soil sample. This was twelve feet in diameter and about two feet in depth. This field was located near the Galloch Farm, Scarsdale, New York. A third disturbance was found. Its shape resembled that of a hand with the fingers spread out. This portion was one half of a square foot and the indentations were 1/2 inch in depth. Another crater was located a distance of forty yards from the first two. This one was circular, about three feet in diameter and two feet in depth. A ring of disturbed crops was also in this section. Nearby fields but unexplained disturbances have evidently indicated an interest of healthy crops to get to it. 
British plants dispose quite a regular pattern of physical disturbances which resemble scorch marks. These disturbances suggest the use of an old World War II rocket launching site which had been modernized and used for a new purpose. The scientists at first felt this would be the meteoritic explanation. First contact with the atom was not sought. Flurry of activity about the center area of the circular crater were found.
Around this first Charlotte crater was discovered, other explorers began activities. Most located in rather remote distant from cities, but still in Scarsdale, Westchester County, Scotland, in the Lanarkshire Hills near Stane. In the Lannermuir Hills near Stonykirk, Dumfriesshire, more were found. The earliest finds in Stanykirk produced craters which were twelve feet apart, 15 feet in diameter, and dished shaped, up to 2 1/2 feet in depth. Rings of scorched grass or spring were evident each crater and extended to a distance of 30 yards beyond the hole. A number of similar craters were found at a distance of 40 yards beyond the holes and a number of smaller ground markings. The craters at Stanykirk were found 35 feet from the craters. In late July, some more craters were discovered near the Stanykirk site. Some of these were "freshly cut" with green edges, indicating a very recent origin, whereas others were overgrown with weeds. 
According to APRO (APRO Bulletin) of Cambridge, "The large circle measure some 30 feet across and within it were three more circles or craters about 12 feet in diameter. The craters were on a slight slope and from the lower center to the upper slope extended about 18 yards wide. The channel from the latter crater was about a quarter of a yards long. Both eventually joined small streams. According to eyewitnesses walks, the long channels did not look at all like anything which might have been caused by runoff or drainage, but rather resembled something which had been cut in the sod or earth, and then widened."

On 22 July 1963, at approximately 10:45 p.m., two unmarried persons, a male and a female, both approximately 30 years old, were walking in a rural area near Scarsdale, New York. The two persons noticed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving. They watched the light for several minutes until it disappeared from view. The light was described as being a bright white color and was larger than a star. It made no sound and appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground. The two persons returned to their automobile and drove to a nearby house where they contacted the local police. The police responded to the area but found no trace of the object.

The image contains a photograph of a saucer-shaped unidentified flying object. The text describes an incident that occurred on July 24, 1963, where Michael Lee and John Dutton, two schoolboys, saw a flying saucer over Roundhay Park Woods in Leeds, British Isles. The object was described as being about one mile away and almost twice as big as their fist length. The document provides further details about the sighting, including the object's movements and characteristics, as well as observations made by other witnesses.

At 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday, 24th July, 1963 Michael Lee and John Dutty, both of came to school with a story of flying saucers that they had seen over Roundhay Park Woods in Leeds. The boys looked to where the saucer had been, and saw it moving away. The boys' headmaster notified the police and the Royal Air Force.

Mr. Malcolm Bull and Trevor Whitaker, both of Halifax Branch of the Flying Saucer Research Organisation, went to investigate the incident. 

The boys were walking due to school when they sighted the object. And reported it as moving from right to left (southwards). It reappeared regularly, as if it were moving amongst the trees. The sky was clear and the object was at an altitude of about 30 degrees and seemed to have a dull surface. It disappeareed and reappeared regularly, as if it were moving amongst the trees. The sky was clear and the object was at an altitude of about 30 degrees and seemed to have a dull surface.

It was about one mile away over Roundhay Park Woods. It made a buzzing noise, seemed to be translucent, and was almost twice as big as the boys' fist length. Michael did not know the diameter of the object, but estimated it to be fairley large. The object was also seen by John Dutty, another ten year old schoolboy.

Mr. Donald Foy, John's uncle, said that the description given by Michael Lee fitted objects he had seen over Leeds eighteen years ago. He had never mentioned these objects to his nephew.

TO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
24 July 1963

Two boys saw sneer:

The two boys, whose identities were concealed, said they saw a strange object maneuvering in the sky on Saturday evening, 22 June 1963, in the Scarsdale area of New York. They reported the object as oval in shape, dark in color, and about 40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be traveling at a moderate speed and maintaining a relatively level altitude. During the sighting, the object seemed to be rotating or spinning. When the object was first sighted, it was at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet. Later, it descended to about 2,500 feet, still maintaining its oval shape and dark color.

The two boys, who were not identified in the report, claimed the object was in sight for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it disappeared from view. They became frightened and ran to a nearby house to report what they had seen. The police were notified, but by the time they arrived at the scene, the object had vanished. No other witnesses to the incident were found.

An investigation was conducted, but the Air Force was unable to identify the object. The case was classified as "unidentified."

Transcribed text:

TWO BOY'S HAVE BOXED
The incident they described is as follows:
On 13 July 1962 two boys, aged 13 and 12, were in a wooded area near Scarsdale, New York, when they observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving erratically, sometimes hovering, sometimes darting rapidly in various directions. The boys watched the light for some time, then it disappeared.
After the light went out, the two boys say they heard a humming sound and saw a dark object descend rapidly and land on the ground about 50 yards from where they were standing. The object was described as oval in shape and about 30 feet in diameter. The surface appeared to be metallic and it had no visible windows, doors or protrusions.
The two boys stated they felt a strange sensation come over them as the object approached and landed. They reported that their bodies seemed numb and they had difficulty speaking or moving. When the object landed, a bright beam of light shot from it to the ground, and the boys said they were temporarily blinded by the intensity of the light.
After a short period of time, the light went out and the object rose rapidly and silently back into the sky where it hovered briefly before speeding away at a terrific rate of speed.
The boys said the incident lasted about 15 minutes. They reported no physical after-effects, but both stated they were quite frightened by the experience.
The report of this incident was submitted to Project Blue Book by the Postal Inspector at Scarsdale.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Information Only
Source: Flying Saucers, Aug 64

In the night of Thursday, 25th
July, 1962 several sightings came
in from the Stratford-on-Avon area and are recorded here with acknowledgments
to the Stratford-on-Avon UPO
Group.
Observers in the Birmingham area describe that there was seen to turn on a bright lightwithrwhich is illuminated the
interior of the aircraft. It
climbed at a fantastic speed and
vanished into the night sky. Fifteen 
witnesses saw this and describe ten objects.
Mr. Dunn and Mr. Cope of
Stratford-on-Avon, who first
reported the sight, describe it as a "big beaming
searchlight" climbing up and up.
The object changed colour from a red to a
white colour of the object, which was
variable toweards the end. It
made a stoppage and then
vanished. It is said that these
casual reports came from several
directions and disappeared in
various directions.
At 11.15 p.m. Mr. B. Wheele-
house reported a bright light which
was coming from the direction of
Evesham. The object was
descending at Wellesbourne and was
seen again at this same location.
Mr. R. Jordan of Alveston,
said that he actually saw it
coming down towards him and it
looked "bigger than a full moon"
which drew his attention
to a very bright light which was
seen from the balcony Terrace of
the Theatre. The light, which
was very bright, appeared to be the
height of a car headlamp and had
two small rays of lights beneath
forming a "V" shape. At 11.20 p.m.
This was at 11:20 p.m. A few
moments later a directed beam of
light came from the object, and
watching very carefully, the object
was seen to move, gaining height and
speed. It was travelling in a
S.W. Direction, when we noticed
it carried a green light on one side
and a reddish-orange light on the other.

No Case (Information Only) 25 July 1963 Blackpool, England

Seven UFOs sighted - 9.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. 

Mr. L. R. Booth of Northumberland Avenue, Blackpool, wrote to the Deputy Director of Operations with details of seven UFOs observed by himself and his family on 8 and 9 August 1963. The report states:

"On August 8 and 9 I have been observing in the sky with my family seven lights, red, yellow, green in color. They have also been seen by others in the Blackpool area. On the evening of August 8 at about 12.30 a.m. I happened to look up and saw these seven lights. They were in a circular formation, very bright, almost like astralight, and moving very fast and silently."

The observer goes on to describe the movements and behavior of the UFOs, noting that they were "splitting a fast pace" and "moving very fast".

The Town councillor sees saucer (Scottish terminology) over a field on August 1, 1963. Following his attention, he mentioned the strange object being white in colour, approximately 50 feet in diameter and some 250 feet above the ground. It made no sound and was hovering motionless for a few seconds to attend the other councillors. The object then moved rapidly eastwards and disappeared from sight quickly. I told my secretary these facts this morning as I received them and she duly recorded them.

The description tallies with that given by Mr. Gallagher of Lanarkshire as described in our file. He had observed the same or a similar object on the evening of the same day at 9.45 p.m. It had disappeared at 9.56 p.m.

The information is very brief. It states that on the night of June 28 and 29, 1963, there was a sighting of what appeared to be a flying object over Wolverhampton, England. The object was described as being bright white in color and was seen by several witnesses. It moved rapidly across the sky and then disappeared. The report concludes that this sighting is being investigated further by the authorities.

Nov-Dec 65
Bernardo de Irigoyen (Province of Misiones)
La Razon (Buenos Aires) for June 9, 1963, carried a report from Rosario stating that General Raul Castillon Perlarin, commander of the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmeria in the North-East), recently gave a press conference at which, inevitably, the great UFO wave of the summer of 1963. In this connection, Commander Zirone told the newspapermen of an interesting earlier sighting - in 1963. He said that on July 27, 1963, when he was commanding the Gendarmerie detachment at Bernardo de Irigoyen, he and the Chief of Police, Commandante Jose Cacicio, and the Deputy-Chief, Senor Luzia, had seen even oval luminous UFOs, flying in a West-East course in the direction of Brazil. The objects, moving at great speed and altitude, gave off many-coloured flashes of light, and as they passed beneath the cloud cover they lit up the clouds with their varied colours. The authorities at Eldorado, 170 kilometres distant, later reported that the formation had passed over there. The paper quotes this as being one of the rare occasions on which a high officer of the Argentine National Force has spoken openly about the UFOs, and notes that what had impressed Commander Zirone most of all was this extraordinary display of colours.

To conclude this part of the Argentina 1963/64 story, here is one of the most suggestive cases of the period, one which has become a "UFO classic".

He first noticed it through the trees in his garden and watched it for a period of about 30 seconds. The object was near the top of the trees, which obstructed his view to some extent. For a period of about 30 seconds he observed it as it moved slowly to the northeast. He had a clear view of it as it passed through a gap in the trees. The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a bright glow. It seemed to be approximately 150 to 200 yards in diameter. The object was near the top of the trees, which were about 50 to 60 feet high. He estimated its height above the ground to be 70 to 80 feet. He said that as it moved, it appeared to lift or tilt to bring it to the horizontal, and the object seemed to be rotating or turning as it moved. His brother had the definite impression that it was a solid, structured object, not a reflection or optical illusion. The object disappeared after about 3 or 4 minutes. Mr. Crowell said the object was a "small, meteorological unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment" and had been released by theodolite.

Flurry of UAO Sightings--In Venezuela
In Venezuela, there were reports of several sightings which took place in this country as follows:
The residents of a section of Caracas were amazed to observe a luminous object on the night of 23 July. The object left the sky towards the northeast.

Noticia's was swamped with telephone calls about the UFO, according to Dr. Villegas, a professor who received the calls. He said the observers could give no more information than others who called about the object: "the observers had seen the object but could not give out any information because of the brevity of the observation." Observers said the object was round, Shines like a dish, and seemed to be darting around above the trees, then shot out of sight at a fast speed. The object started at 8 p.m. and the next morning, Noticia's was told that the object had been sighted but they might be able to furnish an explanation.

Did Object Land Near Caracas?
In addition to the sighting of 23 July, there was another less detailed incident. Mr. and Mrs. Carrero observed the details of a reported landing in the Los Acacias section of Caracas on the evening of the 6th.

At about 6 p.m. large numbers of people, including the Carrero family, observed a brilliant disc-shaped object maneuver in the air, land, and then take off rapidly in the same direction. The object was estimated as 50 feet in diameter, and which appeared to land on a vacant lot adjacent to the Central University of Venezuela. 

The observers in Los Acacias live on a hill and, when they observed the object, it was hovering just off the ground. As the object started to move, it made a hissing sound, shot up high in the air, and then left in the same direction from which it had come. Some at first thought it was a plane that had crashed, and they called various agencies, including the air force and police departments, for help. The man was shining brightly and the observers said the thing was spotted in the sky. Then it descended straight down, hovered for several minutes. When it finally left, it went so fast that many thought it had disintegrated. It was due to this impression that the project had provided, through personnel from the neighborhood, that the object had been sighted.

A short time later, officers of Communications, arrived on the scene shortly after ten o'clock. A thorough search was made but no trace was evident that the object had not actually landed, and had left abruptly, as some witnesses maintained.

North Devon visitor

The North Devon Journal on August 31st 1962 includes a report of a mysterious object which was said to have been seen in the vicinity of Hartland Point, North Devon, on August 27th 1962. It was seen by Mrs. Weston of Combe Martin who was standing outside her home when she noticed the object. It appeared to be silvery-grey in color, orange and was moving brightly north, then changing direction and moving west over Lundy and Hartland Point.

Nottingham mystery
We are indebted to Mr. G. M. Denison for sending us the following account which appeared in the Nottingham Evening Post of July 30, 1963:
"Bridge mystery: two fishermen at Trent Bridge (Nottingham) were startled to see a mysterious object in the sky at about 9.15 p.m. yesterday (Monday).
The bright object appeared to be suspended from a larger body. It hovered for a few minutes, then shot upwards and was lost to sight.
The fishermen, who have been fishing at Trent Bridge for years, said they had never seen anything like it before. They described it as being the size of a large orange ball of fire, which appeared to be giving off its own light.
For an explanation - UFO over Bristol are flying past ever since September.

"Somerset saucer

Witness - Mrs. Edith, Russell, 75 Sunnyhill Avenue, Burnham on Sea, Somerset, England.
August 1, 1963. I wonder what it is! I saw something very strange in the sky above my house. It was saucer-shaped, about 30 ft across, silvery and seemed to be giving off a strong bright light. It moved slowly at first, then it went into a fast jerky motion and then it faded out. This was seen by myself, my husband and my son-in-law, all of Ivy Cottage, West Huntspill. We all stared at it for about 10 minutes. It seemed to flutter as it moved, sometimes it was bright, then it would fade. My son-in-law, who works her husband, came to the door and saw it as well. He said it was a big glowing object that seemed to be moving up and down, then it suddenly shot away at a fast speed and disappeared. We watched it for some time and something seemed to be coming from it, but I could not make out what it was. It seemed to be giving off something like a dark vapor, but this may have been an optical illusion, as it was seen through the glass window. The object then seemed to go higher and higher until it was out of sight. This is the truth, I have never seen anything like it before."

No Case (Information only)
21 July, 1963
Radcliffe, England

SOURCE: Flying saucer moved - apparently 40-60 ft. 
This thing moved from north to south rapidly. There 
were no lights on it at all, and it made no sound. 
Another man who saw the thing thought it was on fire.

*There were three men here and they all saw this thing
go by at an incredible rate of speed. They tried to 
figure out what it was, but no satisfactory explanation 
was found. This is just one of the many things that have
been seen and reported, and this is the only way we can 
get to the bottom of this problem. The strange part is
that so many people could see a red glow around the
object at the same time. All the neighbours were out, 
looking at it. I don't know if there is any way to the 
this mystery, but it has happened.

Mr. Bird's brother thought it was a satellite, but the 
satellite would have been too small to see, and besides it
did not have the steady light that a satellite has. 
These people on other planets - or whatever they are - 
seem to be doing more and more to show themselves to the 
world. In these cases we can see strange shapes in the 
sky, and unusual things happen like the apparent splitting
of the object into two parts. How long this will go on,
no one can tell, but you think more and more people will
see these strange things.

Medway towns mystery
The Gillingham, Rochester and
Gillingham, Essex on August 7, 
1963 at about 10 P.M. a mysterious
phenomenon was observed in the
sky by many people. During the
day sight fully 613 separate
reported describes th
phenomenon in virtually identi
terms. They reported a steady
glowing object, clearly visi
the clear sky, which moved
the horizon at an altitude
about 2,000 feet. There were 
variations of meteorological inter
pretations. On a night when the
sky was clear, the object seemed
to be a kind of illuminated sphere 
as an inverted saucer. At a certain
moment it seemed to separate into
two parts, which then reunited, sti
examining the atmosphere.

Saucer Moving Across the Sky 
Triangular Object  

Sir:- I am enclosing a photo of a triangular-shaped unidentified object which I photographed on 31 July 1963, at Scarsdale, New York. The object appeared to me to be hovering, then began moving in a southeasterly direction. It was visible for about 30 seconds and I was able to get one exposure before it disappeared. The object was gray in color and I have made a sketch of the same. The object was approximately 50 feet across the base and about 25 feet in height. There were no lights visible, but there was a peculiar glow around the object which seemed to give off a very bright light. This light seemed to be coming from the top of the object or from within it, giving the object a brilliant glare and I have made a sketch of the same. The object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed, possibly 500-1000 mph, and was heading in a southeasterly direction. I would appreciate any information you can give me regarding this object.

Mr. Spier's photograph. 
Was directly overhead when photographed and continued in the same position for about 3 to 4 minutes. It then began to move in a southeasterly direction at a very high speed and was soon obscured by clouds. It did not appear to be controllable or have any means of propulsion visible.

Sighted UFO
From the Sunderland Standard:
August 31st. A person, whom I interviewed, reported that at 10:15 p.m. that evening, he had seen a bright light manoeuvring at speed in the sky over West Rainton. He could see no shape or structure, only a bright light. The light appeared to be quite low in the sky in the area of Tunstall Hills and Green.
Here are some additional details from the witness:
He estimated the light to be about 3 miles away and about 1,000 feet high. The light moved in a straight line for a while, then suddenly changed direction at a very high speed. 
Within about 2 minutes the light had disappeared from sight. Neither he nor the other witness with him could tell what the object was.
Their sighting: Probably a fast moving aircraft or helicopter from Sunderland airfield.
Other witnesses: Possibly some.
