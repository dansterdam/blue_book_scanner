Dear Sirs:

I was wondering if there is any possible way you could explain what my friend and I saw on the eve of July 5 1965. We were fishing on Lake Mich. off the shore of St. Ignace. We never reported this because no one would believe us. What we saw was saucer shaped hovering over the water straight out 200 ft. It gave off a bright blinding light-visibility was about 1st temp was 90°. This is all the information I can give have. I would sure like to know. Also if there is any information about these UFO's that we saw in the sky. That you could send me I would sure appreciate it. Thank you.

Yours Truly
