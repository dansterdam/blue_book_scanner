Gentlemen:

I am writing this inquiry in hope that you will
be able to throw some light on a subject that is causing
a great deal of concern to many in this area.

Several UFO sightings have been reported in our
immediate area by local citizens. Although such sightings
are described somewhat differently they are similar.
They are source shaped objects little larger than a car with
red, white, and green lights. It always leaves particular
odor and in one case they declared that felt radiation. The
enclosed article is one of several that have been our local
paper.

On the morning of July 18th our neighbor found in
his front yard directly in front of their home a peculiar
pattern of what appears to be a small area such as a auto would
leave except that it was in a small circle around fifteen feet
in diameter with a small tall like pattern leading off of one side
of it. Throughout second the edge of this circle were several
marks, each fairly evenly spaced and approximately an inch and
a half in depth - marks such as a very large camera tripod
would make. The area is such that an auto, lawn mower or
such device would have left tracks due to several light rains
over the past few days. It also seems curious that the rain
did not fade or wash away the substance.

The couple are a very respectable family in the above
acreage income bracket and not given to telling tales. The
truth is they are afraid to say anything about it for fear of
being laughed at.

The woman seems quite concerned with these so called
UFO sightings so I would appreciate it very much if you would
check the sample of the grass I am enclosing and give us
any possible explanation that you can.

Respectfully yours,

Gainesville, Georgia

ATTN OF: TDEM
SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF 6AROI PB (Msg)                                   1 8 AUG 1964

The Smithsonian Institute has forwarded us a letter from Mr. G. R. Swanson, Gainesville, Georgia.

The following information is provided to assist you in answering Mr. Swanson's letter. The sighting of 13 July, has not been reported to the Air Force; however, a sighting from Spartanburg, South Carolina, on 29 June was reported to Warner Robins Air Force Base and was evaluated as attributable to ball lightning. The facts of the newspaper account of this sighting were much distorted.

The grass samples submitted with the article and letter contained nothing unusual from that expected of a normal grass samples.

The newspaper article of the Turnersville sighting is the first knowledge that Air Force has received. No official report was made to the Air Force on these sightings; therefore, no evaluation is being made at this time.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reference to your recent letter to the Smithsonian Institution on the subject of some unusual phenomena which has occurred in your area.

The July 13th sighting of an "oil spray" type pattern on the grass was never officially reported to the Air Force. However, an analysis of the grass samples enclosed with your letter indicates that they contain nothing unusual from that normally found in grass. The sighting from Spartanburg, South Carolina on June 29th was evaluated as ball lightning.

The facts of the newspaper account of this sighting were much distorted.

The newspaper articles of the Turnerville sightings is the first indication that the Air Force has received of this report. No official report was made to the Air Force on these sightings, and therefore, no evaluation is being made at this time.

Enclosed is a summary of information on the Air Force project for the investigation and evaluation of Unidentified Flying Object reports. We think this brochure will help to explain the UFO phenomena and its causes a little more fully.

Sincerely,

Artist's Conception of UFO
The above is an artist's interpretation of what nine persons at Gainesville saw Tuesday night. The top of the object was visible and the bottom could only be seen when the green light from the bottom was on and reflected back.

Nine Describe UFO

By TOM WINFIELD
GAINESVILLE — An unidentified flying object was sighted Tuesday night in the Habersham County area.

Two women who witnessed the incident described the object as a machine, reported they saw a burning sensation after it passed over.
