Dear Sir

Just within the last few weeks friends and I have been studying the other. During this time we have spotted several unusual aircraft that appear to be round circular shape and appear to travel much faster, with less commercial aircraft and act much different than satellites. We believe satellites we have studied seem to go clear across the rather and disappear out of sight at the other and where these seem or appear to only go up and go straight up only to go so high that then disappear in space. We are wondering if you would please send us some information as to what these conditions

unusual, some diskular aircraft
could be. One of my friends has
spotted one that looked just like a
bright light going across the sky
and then it turned and went straight
up through space and disappeared
in take 1 to 2 minutes going in across
the sky and then shot straight
up into space and disappeared in
1 to 3 seconds completely out of
sight.

Yours sincerely,
