10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round Obj, size of pea, changing white to red, continuous light until disappeared. Observed in level position at 2 o'clock. Disappeared on horizon at 2 o'clock. Spot appeared stationary. Spoke center rapidly to NW, suggested obj moving away, giving no apparent az movement. No break up or diminishing in intensity was noted prior to disappearance. Radar-tagged estimated at 1050 knots by Spokane Center.

11. COMMENTS
Appearance of Obj and its azimuth the observer suggests that it was probably planet Venus. From witnesses' location and altitude planet could have been responsible for this sighting. Reasonable for illusion or notion and atmospheric refraction could have been responsible for color change. It is believed that obj reported by radar was not related to visual sighting other than by possible cause of both being due to atmospheric refraction. The obj of this sighting was probably planet Venus.
