11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a basketball shaped red and yellow object move toward the western sky. Observer had stopped her car at stop sign and before proceeding heard a swish sound. As observer made the turn she noticed a strange glow coming at her. It was all lit up, with a red and yellow glowing light. The object disappeared heading straight upward. Observer compared the unknown to a blimp.

Considering the submitted evidence it appears that the witness saw and reported an aircraft. There is extremely a large air traffic area, and it appears that the witness observed some type of aircraft.

It all started on the 26 of Oct 1966.

I was on my way to secure my car.
I live off [REDACTED] in Holtsville
I stopped at the step sign, looked
to see if any cars were coming.
The time was nine. I was about
to go, something told me to open
my door. I leave a sweat. Although
I my time I looked close but
would better to get out. I noticed
my right turn and as I did
I saw this flying a my [illegible word]
now I looked for my eyes were popping
and I thought my then. Show
looks as one have I now mean

Here is the text from the document:

my eyes set at it looked
like it was hanging over the time
that why I could not believe my
eyes I guess the car will move more
and as it moved faster & more
moved faster until it was
out of site and up at
went. But I know as from what I
can it was a very strange feeling
to see something like that. Which
I will more forget as long as I
live. I hope this will be help
to you fit as hard to describe
on paper. I can describe it well
at the night when I saw it
