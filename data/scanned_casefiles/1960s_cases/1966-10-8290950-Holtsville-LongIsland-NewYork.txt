There is a diagram showing a compass rose with degree markings and a sketch of an observed object in the sky. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine they are at a certain point and indicate the object's position relative to the horizon.

The text reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

My eyes did not discredit what they observed,
that orb, moving over to another position, was real.
I gazed a few moments that my eyes might confirm what
they saw to make certain not to be deceived. and it moved
and as it moved further and further away, its size
decreased until it went entirely out of sight.
Well, it was a strange thing, but I have no reason to
doubt the evidence of my senses which beheld it. If
it weren't so, I would not bother to report it. I just
wanted to be sure I was seeing it right, and was
not the victim of some optical illusion or hallucination.
I know it may seem fantastic, but on the spot, it was
there, and I could not have been mistaken about it.

It was much larger and brighter than a normal aircraft, and did not resemble any known type of aircraft. The object was also observed to suddenly disappear from view. The witness was unable to provide a precise estimate of the object's speed or distance, but described it as moving at a very high rate of speed.
