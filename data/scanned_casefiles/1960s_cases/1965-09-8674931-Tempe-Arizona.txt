THIS LADY HAS SEEN NUMEROUS OBJECTS DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS,
NORMALLY BETWEEN 2030 AND 0300 HRS IN THE VICINITY OF THE
SUPERSTITION MOUNTAINS. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAS HYPER SENSITIVE
HEARING IN HIGH FREQUENCIES AND THAT IS HOW SHE KNOWS UFOS ARE
PRESENT BEFORE SHE SEES THEM. HER SISTER ALSO CAN HEAR THE
SOUND BUT NOT AS SOON AS THIS LADY. LUKE, DAVIS-MONTHAN, AND
WILLIAMS AFBS HAD NO AIRCRAFT AIRBORNE AT THIS TIME AND AREA.

VERY ACTIVE AIRWAY THAT EXTENDS EASTWARD OVER THE SUPERSTI-
TION MOUNTAINS, AND THERE IS NO WAY TO CHECK ON POSSIBLE VFR
TRAFFIC. EXCEPT FOR AN ACTUAL UFO, THIS SIGHTING COULD BE ONE
EAST BOUND AIRCRAFT THAT WENT OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE CREST OF
THE MOUNTAIN AND ONE AIRCRAFT WEST BOUND THAT TURNED TO THE
SOUTHEAST. AT NIGHT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE
TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN MOVEMENT AWAY FROM OR TOWARD THE
VIEWER DUE TO LACK OF DEPTH PERCEPTION REFERENCES.
