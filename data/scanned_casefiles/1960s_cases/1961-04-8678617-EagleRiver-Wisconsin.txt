Obiect hovered around, moved up and down, seemed to be 2 miles distance and 12 ft. thick at center - glowing reddish and greenish color - emitting sparks - no audible sound - appeared to be approximately 70 ft. in diameter - landed and encountered with span - possibly connected somehow. Ground observer examined object, no texture or details visible, only turbulance when departing. UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER DAYLIGHT OR DARK. OBJECT ONLY OBSERVED THROUGH WINDOW - WITNESS CLAIMING TO BE RELIABLE, MATURE INDIVIDUAL WHO DEFINITELY BELIEVES WHAT HE SAW REALLY HAPPENED.
11. COMMENTS
Case received wide publicity through local press, radios, TV, Air Force at scene and in the opinion of the investigating personnel the witness was mentally healthy and that he actually believes he saw the object although there could be some distortion on the part of the witnesses since limited opportunities for complete examination or investigation followed with deduction.

He said he saw a man he identified as Judge L and experienced great difficulty in being admitted to the house. According to the judge, the Air Force appears to be strictly persona non grata among the "flying saucer" people around there. The judge admitted membership in NICAP and his library had one long shelf devoted entirely to flying saucer books and other shelves were devoted to similar material.

The weather was clear and the sun was shining brightly on the metallic
surface. As far as noise was concerned, he stated that there was a con-
tinuous whining sound in the interior of the cabin and that the telautom-
did not involve any particular noise.
The only serious technical flaw in the story is the disappearance of
the craft in "two seconds", or even "a few seconds." The rest of the story
did not contain any outrageous to physical concepts.
Mr. appeared quite sincere to me, did not appear to be the
perpetrator of a hoax, but to attempt to determine whether he had a physical
experience or a mental aberration places in the realm of psychology.
As far as town reaction is concerned, it was evidently quite a high spot
of conversation in the pre- tourist season for some time. The town certainly
had something to talk about; the local bakery had a white-wrapped sign on its
windows stating "Spaceship Cakes", and a local service station had a sign
stating "Spaceships Serviced Here."
It was established that was not a reader of books, and probably
did not have any preconceived notions as to UFO's, except that we do not
know what previous contact he had with the Judge and how much the Judge may
have told him of the flying saucer owner. The Judge did say that when he
talked with who had asked for an appointment late in the evening, he
had shown him numerous pictures of flying saucers in various books but in
each case, said, "No, it's not like that", indicating that the ships he
saw were not in any connection between a study the Judge has in his
home and the jug that was supposedly handed down. At least insofar as the

25 Usable items, though I would not necessarily regard them as such. I later had an opportunity to talk with the Judge in_____ presence and by that time, the Judge was quite voluble and went into detail as to his initial encounter with_______ and the type of questions he had asked______. The Judge posed as an initial skeptic, but it is apparent that in this questioning______________ he undoubtedly introduced many details into the story which were later incorporated bodily by___________ as gospel.
As far as technical details, as regards propulsion systems, trajectories, and the like, it was quite evident to examiners to attempt to estimate the nature further. This man is an itinerant plumber and chicken farmer. He lives alone, his wife works in Chicago and apparently has been for the past two years. He would seem a fit subject, if regarded by a psychologist, as one to whom a mental aberration might occur. The Judge stated, in fact, that he at first thought that the man had become "shack happy", but that after sufficient questioning by the Judge, and been convinced that the sighting was valid.
The sighting with___ one did not give the impression that he was an Adamsnki type. He answered questions directly, did not contradict himself, insisted on the facts being exactly as he stated and he refused to accept conclusions or modifications. He stated there was more that we wouldn't believe him but that he didn't care whether he was believed. He stated simply this happened and that was that. The duration of the entire episode that lasted several minutes, there was a time and at no time did the man appear in any way to threaten him. As they left, the man to whom he had handed the jug placed his hand on his forehead in a curious gesture.

Handles and general overall contours are concerned, although the drawing that made of the Jug does not by any means bear a one-to-one correspondence with the seen contours.

In view of the fact that is is not our practice to investigate cases in which there is only one observer (since such cases are a priori' suspect of mental aberration), this case should not be given too much weight and certainly one cannot expect any sort of a definite solution.

From the appearance of the man, his habits of life and his evident loneliness, it would appear to me that the situation was ripe for suggestibility and mental aberration. The presence of the SHARP judge in the picture probably accounts in large part for the embellishment of the story and the publicity it has attained.

It would be the advice and opinion of your consultant that the Air Force in discussing this case should hold fast to the advisability of not considering seriously any sighting or report from a single individual, and to attest that this case was investigated solely because of its possible nuisance value and because there will undoubtedly be an attempt made to jokey this incident into a full-fledged production.

The wider publicity attends to have public audiences in which will describe this thing and answer questions and this, of course, means undoubtedly there will be public lectures with paid admission. There seem to be now invitation lists from local newspapers, and the like.

has already received many letters which he kindly allowed me to read. The general tenor was that he had been a privileged individual to have this strange experience, and the Air Force in directing any inquiries or publicity of giving them 6 encouragement.

any material evidence. He was warned that the Air Force would attempt to hush him up and that if he gave the Air Force any material evidence he would never get it back. I was questioned a number of times on the ground and Major Keyhoe, and I of course stated that I thought that NICAP was attempting to do a serious job and that they had a lot of interested and sincere members who were trying to do the best they could. In any case, of course, did I attempt to say anything that could later be turned against us as are the uasympathetic toward the efforts of NICAP.

The text in the document reads as follows:

5. The man at the hatch held a thermos-like jug in his hand which was made of the same bright material as the UFO. Though there was no connection between the thermos and the UFO, it was studied by the witnesses and was seen to contain a glowing liquid. After the jug was dropped, the witnesses saw the man exiting the hatch and returning to the hatch as though he was given instructions by the occupants of the UFO. The hatch was closed and the UFO, with the same whining sound that was heard on take-off, disappeared rapidly to the northeast.

6. The witness reported that the space craft was about 12-15 feet high and 35-40 feet in diameter, and that it was bright silver in color and appeared to have a kind of flange or rim around the middle. No occupants could be discerned.

7. It is the opinion of the investigator that Mr. Hyne is a balanced person of good mental health and that he actually believes that he saw what he describes. However, there are indications that this was a hallucinatory experience following by delusion.

8. The investigator has examined samples of both P. Hynek's and this Squadron Investigator's samples of the cakes. These samples of the cakes were analyzed and found to be ordinary pound cake. The ASD conclusion is that the samples were prepared from a local bakery as per normal human practice.

9. This case was discussed with a psychologist of the Aeronautical Systems Division who stated, and it is his opinion, that the witness suffered from a hallucination and it is his contention that the case could be closed due to the witness's mental state. He pointed out that in cases of this type the witness may have had a temporary inability to evaluate his normal perceptions due to the possible danger or injury to the witness's mental health. Many persons who experience these hallucinations under stressful conditions are often reluctant to ever mention the experience again lest their credibility be doubted in their community. Many persons who experience these hallucinations undertake no further action to validate them and the experience can never again be presented to the individual. The psychologist pointed out that such individuals are usually treated as they would be for any neurosis or psychosis and are usually hospitalized for treatment for they are better off various the added concern over their normal condition.

SAFOI-3C (Major Colman)

1. U.S. Air Force investigators that at 1000 on 13 April 1961, investigated the sighting of a bright object reported to have been seen in the sky over Eagle River, Wisconsin. The witness, one James Thomas, reported that he watched the object from his backyard for over 20 minutes and that it hovered near his house and then disappeared to the northeast. The witness provided additional information to the investigators and stated he had contact with the object using a flashlight.  

2. This case was brought to the attention of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center on 26 April 1961 by the British Air Defense Squadron. The Project Consultant, Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University, was requested to interview the witness and conduct an investigation. This investigation was also independently conducted by personnel of the 4602nd Radar Squadron, Antigo, Wisconsin. Findings of these investigations were included in the correspondence.

3. Major Coleman reported that on 13 April 1961 at 1000 hours he was called to an Eagle River residence where the witness, Mr. Thomas, stated he had sighted a strange object hovering near his house, but much louder than an aircraft. He looked out of his kitchen window and saw the object to the northeast of his house and estimated the object to be the size of a small car. The witness said he was not frightened and went out of doors until he lost sight of the object. The Project Consultant, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, subsequently conducted an investigation of this sighting. After its departure he assures it was hovering.  

4. A further case reported to have appeared in the doorway. The occupant was described as being about five feet tall, 120-135 pounds, dressed in a black suit with a helmet or hood and no visible arms or legs. He went back into the doorway and disappeared. Two men described as wearing black crash helmets with white stripes down each side appeared on the scene. They said nothing and disappeared around the corner. The witness could not see their legs. The conclusion of the Project Consultant based on the correspondence is that this case is loose and unconfirmed.

REPORT-33
UFO Sighting, Eagle River, Wisconsin, 18 April 1961
2 June 1961

RAPOR-36 (Major Coleman)

1. Mr. AF___ who resides near Eagle River, Wisconsin, related to U.S. AF___ Investigator that on 18 April 1961, he witnessed the landing of a space craft and had contact with the occupants. Investigation of this case on the 27th April 1961 by the AF___ Investigator resulted in increased confirmation of the incident.

2. According to Mr. AF___, on 18 April 1961 at about 12:30 AM, he was awakened by unusual noises and observed from his kitchen window to the west and saw a large saucer shaped object hovering about 15-20 feet above the ground near the rear end of his driveway. He reported the object was about 40-45 feet in diameter and had a flashing light on the top and bottom. It made no sound and remained stationary for about 10 or 15 minutes. Suddenly, a small hatch opened and two beings emerged. He observed them through his kitchen window, the beings were about 4 1/2 - 5 feet tall, wearing tight fitting metallic-like uniforms and smooth helmets. They then re-entered the object, the hatch closed and the object immediately took off vertically with no sound and disappeared.

3. A search was reported to have opened and a man appeared at the door-like opening who was described as being about 5 feet tall, 150 pounds, dressed in a black skull cap, a heavy black turtle neck sweater, tight black pants, and black high-top shoes. The man had no visible features such as eyes, ears, nose or mouth. He appeared to be smooth-shaven. Mr. AF___ said he could not see through the man to the object. He was told by the man to go back into his house which he did. The object was then seen to rise vertically and depart the scene.

4. Investigation of this case was subsequently carried out by the 6720th Radio Squadron, ATIGO, Wausau, Wisconsin. Copies of reports or investigation of this case were furnished to the various intelligence agencies as per correspondence.

SUMMARY
At 1130, 25 April 1961 Major Friend received telephone call from Captain Williamson, Duluth Air Defense Sector. Captain Williamson's call was to report an incident concerning an alleged flying saucer landing in Eagle River, Wisconsin on 18 April 1961. Mr. [redacted] of Eagle River told Judge [redacted], District Attorney, that a flying saucer had landed on his property on 18 April 1961. Three persons dressed in two-piece black suits, 5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 125 pounds had disembarked from the space craft through a hatch door and proceeded to the water and was rewarded with 3 cakes. The cakes were 2" by 3 1/2" flat, and perforated with holes the size of a pencil (cross-section). The ship that unexpectedly landed before them was described as being 15' thick and 30' in diameter. Exhaust pipes 6 or 7" in diameter protruded from this craft.

Major Friend made telephone contact with Judge [redacted]. The Judge, who has handled a good number of mental cases (psychiatric information), indicated that he believes Mr. [redacted]'s story. The Judge stated that the cakes were still fresh one week after the incident. Two of the cakes are still in the possession of Mr. [redacted]. One cake was forwarded to Major Donald E. Keyhoe by Judge [redacted].

ACTIONS
1. Contacted Major William Coleman, SAFOI-3, and informed him of the incident and of the actions taken by ATIC.
2. Informed Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Project Consultant, and requested that he proceed to Eagle River and investigate the incident. Dr. Hynek is located at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, and therefore relatively close to Eagle River, Wisconsin.
3. Attempts to contact Mr. [redacted] being continued.

9. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials or photographs, was specifically excluded in this investigation.

12. Upon request of Hq 5th Air Division, the undersigned conducted an inquiry into a reported landing of a UFO near Eagle River, Wisconsin, following is a summary of the information obtained:

13. About 1100 AM, 13 April 1961 the observer was standing in his kitchen when he noticed some unusual objects or vehicles, which he believed to be pavement or like jet bombers, which frequently overfly his house, but such vehicles. Sighting continued for several minutes as the observer watched from his kitchen window and saw a very bright light, like chrome, slowly moving up and down or hovering in the air. The light appeared to diminish entirely and he was standing about 10 or 15 feet away from his UPC. The UFO appeared to be stationary for a time, then suddenly it shot up into the air at tremendous speed and disappeared from sight.

14. A brush opened a trunk lid. The latch was about 3 feet by 6 feet and opened upward from the rim of the UFO. A man was standing in the doorway. The man told this witness that he was confused in identifying the object from the street outside his home. The man rushed up stairs, took off sweater and black tight fitting trousers with white stripes down each side.

15. The man expressed he could not see very well inside, however he observed what appeared to be three or four control panels, each about two feet square, with a white strip (which the man compared to the latch) seated at the center panel. with his back to the latch. A bright orange or red glow was seen inside the craft. The man had the impression the craft was about 25' long, 18' wide and 4' thick. There was no flame or exhaust and the craft made no sound, about the size of a medium station wagon and larger. These were described by the witness as silent and metallic in appearance. The object rose and hovered in an upright position, about 15 feet above the ground and then toot off silently into the air moving slowly at first and then shot out of sight to the northwest.

15. There was right switchable and a left switchable. The cables were black or solid round twisting like ordinary rope. The inside equipment was wrapped in a black, except for controls on the control panel. There was no illumination inside equipment.

15. The man at the hatch held a thermos like jug in his hand, which looked to be about 16 to 18 inches in capacity, and full of some bright chrome mixture, possibly to be the UFO. The same metal material was used inside the jug instead of glass. The man reached inside the jug by his hand and appeared to be filling something which he put inside the jug. He then took a paper towel, went to the atoms in his basement and rinsed the jug with water. He returned with the jug, turned it upside down and shook it, some dark grey material came out, runny and cold, like ordinary metal. The man in the hatch is turn handed the jug to this observer. These canes were warm. A sample of some of the material that came from the jug was obtained and weighed to be about 4 oz. and solid, not melted or pliable. When the observer returned the salute, he stepped back to the corner of the house and the hatch was closed manualy be the man who reached up and disappeared in the object.

April 21, 1961, 6:00 PM
Location: Stan Kukarich and Bev Bueschel
Officers: Subject claims saucer landed in his driveway, discharged 2 beings and then took off over the water and gave it to occupants. (3) Saw one of them cooking "pancakes".
Subject made eating motion and was given a saucer.
Saucer supposed to be 30' diameter and 12' high. Hatch was approximately 3' diameter.
Officers looked over area but found no evidence of landing. Inspected one circle made approximate 12/15' which seemed to be about 1/2" deep. Subject impression was that of a saucer descending. It smelled like pumpernickle. 
When I (Kukarich) requested to write answers to questions on my pad he said he wouldn't tell me about the incident.
Investigation and interrogation lasted about 1/2 hour.

Signed (Stan Kukarich)

There were no sightings in this area was received by the Sheriff's office after the initial sighting.

When the hatch was closed, its outline could not be discerned. The intense yellow-green color returned to the normal 22 or 23 feet diameter and descended to the South. It disappeared in about 2 seconds. The observer said he withhold calling anyone until 20 April when he was here.
16. The disposition of the four pancakes received from the alleged UFO occupants is as follows:
a. One-half cake to NICAP, Washington, D. C.
b. One-half cake to Dr. J. A. Hynek, Dearborn University, Evanston, Illinois.
c. One-half cake to writer of this report (exhibit attached).
d. Remaining one and one-half cakes, less a sample nibble by Joe Simonton, in his possession.
17. A Judge was telephonically questioned in connection with the sighting and said that he has no further statement to make than the original report form. It is considered that no further investigation in this case is warranted at this time since the finding was apparently a result of being unidentified and not a result of any malfunction in aircraft or evasive aerial phenomena. Further inquiry locally concerning Judge and the witnesses were out that he shall examine the official case file and determine if any further explanation for the sighting can be corroborated. A negative review and final close-out of this case was recommended.
18. Mrs. Reid was interviewed because her name was signed to the original form. She said she was the first person to hear Judge laughing, but she did not observe the object. She pointed out that Judge said that he tossed the pancakes up to the craft, and said it tasted like sawdust. She concluded that Judge was not reacting over-excited and assured that he was not joking or making up the story.
19. A thorough investigation was carried out to ascertain complete background of the incident, however, that the Sheriff's Office of Eagle River, Wisconsin received a number of reported sightings and that the Air Force at the time investigated but concluded that the incident would be classified inconclusive due to lack of sufficient evidence to support the report.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an encounter with a UFO. The text of the document is as follows:

IT took it to the basement where he had a pump and filled it with water, carried it out to the craft, and banked it up to the craft. In doing so, he had to get up on tiptoe and put one hand against the craft, he says, and effected the transfer of the jug. He described the interior as extremely black, and said he saw three control panels, and noted that there were two other men inside. The men he described as extremely clean-shaven, he said very smooth-faced, but dark and short, about 5 feet, he estimated. He said they looked like Italian. Their dress was also black, like a "limited jersey" was as close as he could come to it, and he insisted that they had turtle-neck counter-type apparel. From his account, it seemed to be that it was aware of the approach through some sense of ours that could not now be determined. There was no communication except by sign language between them, and as he backed away from the craft, he said he saw the interior lights, and that it was extremely beautiful. He said he could see to have a room painted in the same way. He noticed that one of the men was apparently cooking something, and in his attempt to communicate by sign language, indicating that they had water, he came back and motioned with his mouth that they could not drink, but apparently this sign language was misinterpreted as indicating that he wanted some of the stuff they were cooking, and thereupon they handed him three or four of these little monelike cakes, and as soon as the transfer was effected, the hatch swung down, closed with a click, and he says that the "doing" was incomprehensible, he could not tell whether the batch had been open or not, that it rose vertically without any apparent acceleration, except, of course, at a tremendous rate of speed.

Using optical character recognition (OCR), the text found in the document is as follows:

3. The man at the hatch held a jar the size of a mason jars due to his hand which was hanging on the side of the hatch, but he was holding something that he was aware that the men wanted the jug filled with water. After he let go of the hatch he proceeded to get the jug filled with water. The witness reported that he stepped back and exchanged a salute with the occupant inside.

6. The witness reported that the space craft was about 15 feet high and 30 feet in diameter with saucer 6 or 7 inches in diameter protruding from the edge. When the hatch was closed its outline could not be distinguished.

7. It is the opinion of the investigators that Mr. [REDACTED] is telling the truth but that he was mistaken in certain details which he observed and which he believes he saw. There are some inconsistencies in the story which tend to indicate that this was a hallucination.

8. The witness, Mr. [REDACTED], gave both Dr. Hynek and the 97th Radar Systems Command and the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, copies of the report. The AEC conclusion is that this appears to be a case of hallucination, probably due to the intense fatigue.

9. This case was discussed with a psychologist of the Aeronautical Systems Command. The witness suffered a hallucination and subsequent delusion concerning his experience. He pointed out that if cases of this type were to be classified and accepted as real, this would upset the witness considerably due to the experience. He pointed out that if cases of this type are accepted, the government would be faced with the problem of investigating the validity of the claims because of the possible danger of injuring the witnesses. Experiences followed by delusions, he feels, are not at all uncommon and should be regarded as psychological reactions, for which there may be reasonable explanations, rather than as evidence of visits from visitors from outer space.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
EAGLE RIVER, WISCONSIN
APRIL 14, 1961

At about 11:00 a.m. on April 18, _____ was having a late breakfast in his home. (See picture) when he heard a noise which he described as a "car going around a curve in a great hurry." He said it was actually like a jet. It was dazzling, and, he said (some time later) that ___ had told him that it had made a sound like a crackling motor. The noise seemed to be the sound as it made its way while coming down was in a whirling sound "like a jet." Apparently he said it was on its way down it sounded like "swooshy tires on a wet pavement," and that the object and any disturbance of the air seemed to be circular in shape, and the motion of the object which he described as two soap boxes, one overturned on the other, stated he was not frightened by the apparition, but was out immediately, because of his curiosity. When he got there, they had all disappeared, and he stated that the hatchway opened, something like a trunk of a car that it hinged from on top and the lower lip would coincide with the center of the ship. He stated this when it opened it was completely impressive, and that he would have sworn there was no possible opening there. The space ship as drawn by him is enclosed. When he came out, an occupant or said vehicle was leaning out of the hatch and making motions with his hands cautioning that he passed that he made some other liquid. That is, he drank a drinking motion. He was handed down a "thermos-like bottle" (see drawing) which he says was quite unlike any she had the time ever seen before. "A beautiful thing," he said.

"So intense was it, though I almost do not necessarily object, in that I later had an opportunity to talk with the judge, in the presence and by that time, the Judge was quite voluble and went into great detail as to his initial encounter with - and the type of questions he had asked - which, of course, is apparent that in this questioning of - he undoubtedly introduced many details into the story which were later incorporated bodily by - as his own.

As far as technical details, as regards propulsion systems, trajectories, and the like, it was futile to attempt to pursue the matter further. In discussing the matter he apparently was very close-mouthed and defensive. He lives alone, his wife works in Chicago and apparently has been for the last two years. He would seem a fit subject, if regarded by a psychologist, as one to whom a mental aberration might occur. The Judge stated, in fact, that he at first thought that he had become "Polish hoppo", but that after questioning by the Jury and had been convinced that the sighting was valid.

In talking with - one did not get the impression that he was an Admiral type - he answered the questions directly and was apparently telling the facts being exactly as he stated and he refused to accept embellishments or modifications. He stated he was sure that we wouldn't believe him but that he didn't care whether we did or not. He stated simply this happened and that was that. The duration of the entire episode was about 45 to 50 minutes.

Regarding his report, I did not see it, he apparently did not make it known to me nor in my way as to approach him. As they left, the two men to whom he had handed his manuscript told me in a tone of disappointment that if I wanted to see it, I would have to contact them."

Lifted 450 and took off toward the south and descended in 2 or 3 seconds, or "two seconds", as he also said. As it took off, there was a considerable blast from the pine trees, bending it severely although it came back to normal shortly thereafter. We examined the trees; there were some broken branches on it, but no stated that that was not caused by the ship but had been caused by a snowplow some weeks previous.

After we had taken a number of pictures, and went over numerous points with him, we invited him to dinner and bounded into town. In the meantime resting a car from a garage so that we could look up the other people in the case. We had a rather lengthy dinner in which I attempted to draw him out on various topics, people seemed eager to converse, and he was reacted as though he was a very respected member of the community. I excused myself and went into the bar to strike up a conversation with people there, and both in the bar and outside in the street by the men it appeared that the man was known, and I was told that, although there were some rather voluble skeptics, I was advised to talk with him further, a man named [REDACTED] who I was told could tell me quite a bit about his case. [REDACTED] told us that he was instructed by the secret service to do this and not to talk about it.

[REDACTED] talked with Judge [REDACTED] and experienced great difficulty in being admitted to the house. Apparently the judge thought he was from the government trying to investigate the flying saucer people around there. The judge admitted immediately in house and his library had one line their device entirely to flying saucers people and other studies were carried by desire to know more concerning these apparent visitations.

Weather, of salute and appreciation which weather was referred to in the weather was clear and the gun was shining on the metal of the craft. As far as noise was concerned, he stated that there was a continuous whining sound in the interior of the craft and that the take-off did not involve any particular sound and only seemed technical in the story. The disappearance of the craft in "two seconds", or even "a few seconds." The rest of the story did not contain any outrage to physical concepts.

It appeared to be the appearance of a haze, but to attempt to determine whether he had a physical experience or a mental aberration. Places the matter in the hands of psychic. As per a story is concerned, it was evidently quite a high cost of conversation in the pre-tourist season for some time. The town certainly had something to talk about, the local bakery had a white-haired sign on its interior stating "Respect for Flying Saucers", and a local business which had a high rating.

It was established that the does is not a member or leader, and probably did not have any previous motions and except that he did not know what previous contact he had with the Judge and how much the Judge may have told him of the flying saucer case. The Judge did say that when he talked with he was impressed and was talking about his application into the evening. He had shown the Judge pictures of flying saucers in various books but in no case said "No, it wasn't like that, it was like this," and so on. There is some connection between what the Judge said that was emphatically denied down. At least, there as the where as the .

Handles and general overall contours are concerned, although the drawing that is made of the jug does not by any means bear a close-to-scale resemblance with the jug concerned.

In view of the fact that it is not our practice to investigate cases in which there is only one observer (since such cases are a priori suspect of mental aberration), this case should not be given too much weight and certainly one cannot expect any sort of a definite solution.

From the appearance of the man, his habits of life and his evident mental qualities, it would appear to be sure that the discussion was just an hallucination and a mental aberration. The presence of the NICAP judge in the picture probably accounts in large part for the embellishment of the story and the publicity it has attracted.

It would be the advice and opinion of your consultants that the Air Force in discussing this case should hold fast to the advisability of the general policy of not considering any such incidental or report from a single individual, and so state that this case was investigated solely because of its possible nuisance value and because there will undoubtedly be an attempt made to jackpot this incident into a full-fledged production.

The judge already intends to have public lectures in which he will describe this thing and answer questions and this, of course, means undoubtedly there will be public lectures with paid admission. There seems to be some indication that since such shows are a tourist attraction this summer, and the like, this place will be a tourist attraction this summer, and the like.

He has already received many letters which he has kindly allowed to be read. The general tenor was that this had been a privileged communication and that the Air Force in divulging any information or particularly, of giving this communication is a violation of his privileged position.

Any way, this evidenee. He was that the Air Force would attempt to hush him up and that if he gave the Air Force any material evidence he would never get it back. I was questioned at length, of course, and Major Keysor, and I of course stated that I thought that NICAP was attempting to do a serious job and that they had a lot of interesting and sincere members who were trying to do the best they could. In no sense, of course, did I attempt to say anything that could later be turned against us as are the unsympathetic toward the efforts of NICAP.

MR. ROBERT H. HOERBER

Dear Mr. Hoerber:

This letter is in reference to your recent inquiry concerning the object sighted by you over the Eagle River, Wisconsin area on January 8, 1961.

The incident has been thoroughly investigated by the United States Air Force and the following information has been obtained:

On the date in question, at approximately 6:30 P.M., an unidentified flying object was sighted by several residents of the Eagle River, Wisconsin area. The object was observed to be hovering over the town for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Our investigation has revealed that the object was most likely a conventional aircraft, possibly a jet or helicopter, that was conducting routine training or other operations in the area. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object is consistent with the performance capabilities of various military and civilian aircraft.

While we understand your interest in this incident, we do not believe that the object constituted an extraterrestrial or unconventional aircraft. The United States Air Force is confident that the observed object was a conventional aircraft, and no further investigation is warranted.

If you have any additional information concerning this or other UFO sightings, please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your continued interest in air defense and national security matters.

Sincerely,
(Signature)

Report of the investigation of the sighting at Eagle River, Wisconsin, purported to have been made on April 18, 1961, by Mr. [redacted] (investigated by Dr. J. A. Hynek, Mr. [redacted] supervised by J. A. Hynek).

Chronological Event:
Higher-powered called me at approximately 10:48 a.m., April 26, to say that he had just been in touch with Judge [redacted] at Eagle River, and that the Judge stated that he had sent some material to Donald Keyhoe and NICAP. Judge Malone said it would be advisable to learn more about the sighting. In view of the fact that we had been strongly urging immediate case liability on the part of the Air Force to investigate when witnesses were ready, it was decided to try to get in touch with the witness immediately. He soon made contact with him, and an investigation was conducted in Astronomy at Northwestern University. A Bonanza single engine plane was hired from Waukegan Airport. However, at approximately 3:40 p.m., arrival was made at the airport, ground transport was used into town to make phone calls. Contacted Mr. [redacted], brother of the editor of the News Review of the Vilas County. Mr. [redacted] attempted to call the principal witness, but no contact was made. Church to ascend would take us out to his farm (cultivated run), about 4 miles out of town. However, [redacted] was not present on our arrival, so we took the opportunity of taking pictures, while Saturn hovered in the sky. Pictures were taken by 35mm Leica and black and white 23 Millimeter by [redacted]. No further sightings materialized and we departed about 6:30 pm and there was sufficient light to take pictures. Pictures enclosed.

HE TOOK IT TO THE BASEMENT WHERE HE HAS PUMP AND FILLED IT WITH WATER, CARRIED IT OUT TO THE CRAFT, AND INSTALLED IT BACK IN THERE. IN DOING SO, HE GOT UP ON A LADDER AND PUT ONE HAND AGAINST THE CRAFT, HE SAYS, AND EFFECTED THE TRANSFER OF THE JUG. HE DESCRIBED THE INTERIOR AS SPECIFICALLY BRIGHT, AND SAID HE SAW THREE CONTROL PANELS. HE DESCRIBED THE THING WITH TWO OTHER MEN INSIDE. FROM HIS DESCRIPTION, IT APPEAR TO BE EXTREMELY CLEAN-SHAVEN, OR SHAVED, AND SHORT, ABOUT 5 FEET, HE EXPLAINED. HE SAID THEY LOOKED LIKE INDIANS. THEIR DRESS WAS ALSO PLAIN, A METALLIC GRAYISH "COVERALL" TYPE GARMENT. FROM HIS ACCOUNT, IT SEEMS TO GO ON TO SAY THAT IT WAS MORE LIKE THE STEREOTYPED PICTURE ONE GETS OF ITALIAN SPORT CAR RACERS, OR AT ANY RATE, AS THE REPORT SAYS "THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION EXCEPT BY SIGN LANGUAGE WITH THEM". AND HE SEEMED THEM, AND HE SEEMED SURPRISED THAT HIS CRAFT, HIS VEHICLE, LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE THEIR CRAFT.

UFO SIGHTING EAGLE RIVER
Wisconsin
27 April 1961

We are at the east edge of our farm residence about 12 miles east of Eagle River, Wisconsin. It was reported to me on Friday, April 27, 1961.
The first person to witness the sighting was Mrs. --------- at about 7:30 pm. And how old are you? Seventeen, sir.
What did you see when you first saw it? At first I didn't realize it was a flying saucer or an unidentified flying object, I thought it was a plane. I was just looking at it and then I saw the door close up. What time of day was this? This was about 25 or 30 till seven, and I noticed it had a funny light.
Was that during the evening? Yes, during the evening, I told Mrs. --------- and she looked. She didn't seem to believe me at first. I had to look again and call her and then I said "My God, look at that." She came over and she looked and she said "You're right, what is your family name?" I said "------.'' She said "Well, you want to see a flying saucer?" And I said "Yes," and she said "Well look there it is. Look at it. Look at it."
When she reported this sighting to you, what was your first reaction? I have seen them before and I almost knew it was one. But there it was, flight before us and we watched it for a short period of time, and it went over the house and said "Ma'am, you want to see a flying saucer?" And I said "Yes," and she said "Well look there it is. Look at it. Look at it."

BYC

It's library had one long shelf devoted entirely to flying saucer books and other shelves were devoted to topics which are generally regarded as lunatic fringes. Thought I myself do not share them as such, I had an opportunity to talk with the judge in this case who was quite voluble and went into great detail as to his initial encounter, the judge posed as an initial skeptic, but it is significant that in this questioning by the investigating officer who introduced many details into the story which were later incorporated logically into the report. 

As far as technical details, as a psychological organization, this and the like, it was futile to attempt to pursue the matter further. When an influential person and witness were involved, there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the investigators to press the matter, lest they be charged with harassment. As a result he was left alone, we were unable to obtain much progress on the subject, if regarded by a psychologist, as one who would seek a mental obsession might occur. The judge stated, in fact, that he at first thought that he had become "hoaxed", but when other information was gathered, but that later questioning by the Judge, had been convinced that the sighting was valid.

A special thing - the witness did not get the impression that he was an intentional deceptor, did not contradict himself, and he seemed to accept the facts being exactly as he stated and he refused to accept embellishments or modifications. He stated he was sure that we wouldn't be able to obtain a clear picture, and that was that. The duration of the entire episode was about five minutes. He stated also that at no time was he frightened, and at no time did he have a peculiar sensation. As they left, the witness was completely convinced in his own mind as to what he had observed as a definite reality.

Text from the document:

He says that the thing was inoperative, he could not tell what the heck had been. And immediately the caxt, he stated, rose up like an elevator without any apparent acceleration, except, of course, at the very beginning. And what immediately followed as a sight of some so gassy, it started by 10' and took off towards the earth and disappeared in "a matter of seconds", or "two seconds", as he also said. As it took off, there was a considerable blast from the rear without any noise, which did seem his little thing hovering just before it severely all-enough it came back to normal shortly thereafter. We examined the tree, there were some broken branches on it, but he stated that that was not caused by the only but has been marked by a remarkable storm. 
After we had taken a number of pictures, and went over numerous points with him, we invited him to dinner and loaded into town, in the meantime waiting on the time the company promised to that he would back up the scene. We had a rather lengthy dinner in which I strived to draw him out on various topics.

In view of the fact that it is not our practice to investigate cases in which there is only one observer (being such cases as this), this case should not be given too much weight and certainly one cannot expect any sort of a definite solution. From the appearance of the case, his habit of life and his actions indicated, it would appear to be a mental aberration. The presence of the HIGAP made in this picture probably accounts in large part for the unbelievable character of the story and this multiplicity is has attained.

It would be the advice and opinion of your consultant that the Air Force in discussing this case should hold fast to the advisability of the general public not under no circumstances contacting or making any requests from a flying saucer observation which is observed, and to state that this case was investigated solely because of its possible nuisance value and because there will undoubtedly be an attempt made to induce this individual under an official production. The judge already informed us that it will descends this siting and answer questions and this, of course, means undoubtedly there will be public interest and possibly with said evidence. There seems to be some indication that since Eagle River is a tourist town, that it will be a definite attraction this summer, and the like.

As I have already received many letters which he kindly acknowledged me to the General Counsel's officer, he had hoped to give to be privileged individual to divulging any information or particularly of giving them any additional evidence. For that reason, he asked that the Air Force do not provide any additional information lest it be used to again promote this or give this to the individual public meetings in which he would never give it them. I must express again that I thought this incident was approaching to a conclusion to go to a particular.

As far as the near encounter is concerned, it evidentally quite a high speed of conversation in the pre-Coulomb season for some time. The person certainly had something to talk about, and the witness had a white-washed sign on its window, indicating "Approaching vehicle". It was established that - is not a regular of looks, and probably did not note any particular motions to to the fact that he did not know what he had with the judge and how such the judge could have told him of the flying saucer case.

TO:  SAFOI-3c (Major Coleman)

1. The attached report was received from the U.S. Air Force Investigators that at 0100 on 18 April 1961, he witnessed a UFO sighting while on duty near Eagle River, Wisconsin. He was accompanied by four (4) other persons for providing the watch and the sighting was observed by all five (5) individuals.

2. This case was brought to the attention of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) on 25 April 1961 by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine. The request was made to evaluate the reported incident. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Chief of Northwestern University Astronomical Observatory, has been contacted and further details are being obtained.

3. It is reported that, on 18 April 1961 at 0100 hours, the witness reported he observed a brilliant light which appeared to be hovering over his home, but much smaller. He looked out of his residence and observed the object ascend rapidly and disappear. The witness said he was not frightened and went out of doors until the object had disappeared. He then returned to his residence and reported the incident to the USAF.

4. It has been reported that there were two apparent trails in the object's path, one above and one below, and that the object appeared in the doorway of the witness's home. The occupant was described as being about five (5) feet in height, heavy in stature, with a heavy black or dark brown full beard, and was wearing a bright silver suit.

Transcribing the text:

5. The man at the watch said he observed a white, circular object in the sky which appeared to move laterally at a rapid rate of speed. This object seemed to have a tail and was oscillating through the air. It disappeared from sight behind a wooded area. The witness reported that he stopped what he was doing, looked at the object steadily, and watched it until it disappeared. He states that he was quite sure this was not an aircraft or weather balloon.

6. The witness reported that the space craft was about 15 feet high and 50 feet in diameter. Approaching from the edge, when the hatch was closed its outline could not be seen.

7. It is the opinion of the Investigator that the... concerning this incident cannot be satisfactorily explained. Interviewers have reason to believe the witness is truthful and gives a statement without any tendency to exaggerate or sensationalize the story, which tends to indicate that this was a bona fide sighting.

8. The witness, a... engineer, is both Dr. Hynek and the ATIC radar expert's immediate superior. Hynek considers this case to represent one of the more significant reliable UFO sightings reported to Project Blue Book. Hynek recommended that this case be entered in the Master Sighting File under the category of "Unknowns" rather than "Insufficient Information." His recommendation was accepted.

Well, I haven't known anything about this situation, How about now.
Tell I believe it. I, of course, was just in the house, and I came out looking, and about 20 feet above the ground, I saw it. And what did you see? Well, I just saw something fly over, just like the guy in Eagle River described except that the same thing, but together. It seemed to me at that time, to come from up above and go down.
Well, I saw it for maybe two or three minutes. That's all I have any military authorities or government agencies questioned on this thing? No, they haven't. I'm trying to get in touch with you.

SPACE PAPER ANALYSIS TO NEGATIVES - On May 9, 1961, the results of the photographic analysis on the Eagle River, Wisconsin case were forwarded to the Project Blue Book office in Dayton, Ohio. The report indicates that a photographic analysis was conducted on two 35mm negatives received from the observer, a Mr. [REDACTED]. The negatives were sent by the observer for expert analysis to determine if they represented a "genuine anomaly" or were a hoax.

The analysis found that the negatives showed no retouching or alteration, and the details and characteristics of the images were consistent with normal photographic processes. The report states that "from the photographic evidence alone, it is not possible to determine whether the object photographed represents an actual 'flying saucer' or some other unidentified aerial phenomenon, or whether it is the result of a hoax." The report concludes that "the photographic evidence is inconclusive" and that further investigation would be required to make a determination.

The report also notes that the observer, Mr. [REDACTED], was interviewed and provided additional details about the sighting. However, those details are redacted from the document.

Source: Flying Saucer Review (Jul-Aug 1963)
Date: Unknown

On June 4, 1961, at about 10:10 p.m., a Mrs. Susan Barefield, of Eagle River, Wisconsin, observed a bright, oval-shaped object hovering near the ground about a mile from her home. She watched it for several minutes through binoculars. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was giving off a bright white light.

After a few minutes, the object began to rise rapidly and ascend into the sky. As it gained altitude, the light became dimmer and the object appeared to change shape, becoming more circular. It then accelerated and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction.

Mrs. Barefield immediately reported the incident to the local police department. The report was forwarded to the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book for investigation.

RECENT UFO SIGHTING

SUBJECT: LANDING IN WISCONSIN FARM FIELD

On November 17, 1961 at approximately 9:45 P.M., Mr. and Mrs. M reported that they observed an unidentified flying object land in a farm field near their home in Eagle River, Wisconsin. 

The sighting began when they noticed a bright light in the sky, which appeared to be descending. The light seemed to hover or maintain a steady position for a short period of time, then landed in a nearby field.

The witnesses stated that the object was circular in shape, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitted a bright bluish-white light. They reported that the object remained on the ground for about 10 to 15 minutes before taking off at a high rate of speed.

The couple indicated that they heard no unusual sounds associated with the landing or takeoff of the object. They also stated that no other witnesses or reports of the incident were known to them at the time.

The Air Force investigation determined that the description of the object and its behavior was consistent with reports of similar unidentified aerial phenomena. However, no definitive conclusions could be drawn regarding the nature or origin of the observed craft.

The case was classified as "unidentified" and added to Project Blue Book's files for further analysis and study.

The Eagle River Incident
A NEW CONTACT CLAIM

A LIEUTENANT and two men, who were sent out, as a special patrol, to investigate a "sighting" of a strange object, at Eagle River, Wisconsin, have filed a rather startling report with Capt. Harold Fletcher, information officer for the 547th AC&W Squadron.

The lieutenant reported as follows: 

"We had just started on our routine patrol when, without warning, we noticed a strange, peculiarly-shaped object hovering in the sky, about 50 feet off the ground. This object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and a dull, metallic color. 

As we approached the object, it began to move away and then suddenly it accelerated with tremendous speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

We immediately began an investigation of the area and noticed that a large patch of the ground seemed to have been scorched and a rather unusual depression was found in the center of this scorched area. We were unable to determine the cause of the scorching and depression and have turned the matter over to higher authorities for further investigation."

Ground crews have been sent to the area to make a thorough examination of the site and to determine, if possible, the cause of the scorching and depression in the ground.

This new "contact" claim is being carefully investigated by officials of the 547th AC&W Squadron and we will report any further details that may be obtained.

Hampshire Sighting
On the 31st of July 1955, at 1:15 a.m., two members of the U.S. Air Force, who were on guard duty at a communications site in Hampshire, England, sighted an unusual object in the sky.

The object was described as being approximately 25-30 feet in diameter and had a pulsating reddish-orange glow. It appeared to be hovering and then moved rapidly away, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.

The two airmen reported their sighting to their commanding officer. An investigation was carried out, but no explanation for the sighting could be determined.

This is a remarkable story as the object was observed at close range by two competent witnesses, who were trained observers. Their story is authentic and the details they provided are consistent with other similar sightings.

The image contains a map of the Vilas County area in Wisconsin. The map shows various boundaries, including county, civil township, national forest, and reservation boundaries. It also includes the locations of highways and roads. The text at the top of the image states "WISCO VILAS COUNTY THE HEADWATERS".

YEAR AFTER YEAR, WISCONSIN
VILAS, the Headwaters County, is located at the top of Wisconsin, the outstanding vacation area of the middle west. With 1,000 named waters, there are more lakes in this county per square mile than any other county in Wisconsin.

Among these are two of the world's longest chain of inland lakes. The Eagle Chain is the 16th longest, while the Cisco Chain, bordering Wisconsin and Michigan, is the third longest.

Fishing is of course one of the county's major attractions. There are many fine trout streams, including the Eagle, Brule, DuBay, Deerskin, Beaverdam, Plum, and Tamarack. The Cisco and Eagle lakes, as well as numerous smaller lakes, are rich in both game and pan fish. The state conservation department, under the leadership of Ed Schneberger who was the first in the state to be assigned to the Vilas county area, has built up Vilas into a county to become a rainbow water. One of the first in the state to be placed under this program was the "misky over" for stepped brook trout developed in Ohio's Maumee Lake.

Walleyes get the attention of many anglers and are probably the most popular after the musky. As a matter of fact, in many of the lakes and streams, walleyes supply a great part of the fishing raised in two conservation department pens near Eagle and Phelps, a practice first initiated by the Vilas County lakes. One of these is in Taxarack Pond, 15 acres in the Town of Conover. Two small walleye rearing ponds, bentling the 23 acres, Presque Ude Rearing Pond near the village of Presque Isle. The other is Tamarack Pond, 19 acres in the Town of Conover. Two small walleye rearing ponds,

Got 'Cakes' from Saucer Men Is Claim of Joe Simonton
Report Stirs State, Then Much of U.S.

By a STAFF WRITER
The alleged "flying saucer" and two "saucer men" reported by Joe Simonton, 60-year-old chicken farmer, near Eagle River, Wis., Saturday, April 18, has stirred statewide, and then nationwide attention, since the incident.
Many residents of this community expressed amazement and curious interest in the report of the rural resident of this area.
Simonton claims he received "pancakes" from the silver-suited men aboard the craft, which hovered near his home for a few minutes before flying away. He handed the men a pitcher of water, which they accepted, and they in turn gave him four small pancake-like discs before departing.
Simonton appeared calm and collected when interviewed shortly after the incident by officials of the air force, the FBI and local law enforcement officers.
The national press services have been giving wide coverage to the "flying saucer" incident. Newspapers from Washington to Los Angeles have carried the story, and radio and television stations have featured it for the past few days, until this Friday.
The U.S. Air Force has sent a team of investigators to the Simonton farm to probe the incident. At the same time, officials of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, have expressed interest in the case and requested that the "pancakes" be forwarded to them for examination.
The national press services describe the incident as follows:
"Simonton, 60, a part-time chicken farmer, said he was out walking about 12:07 p.m. last Saturday when he saw a shiny, circular object descend about 40 feet from his house. He said two men emerged from the craft and one of them handed him four small pancake-like discs which he accepted. He said he then offered them a pitcher of water, which they took and drank before re-entering the craft and flying off."
The case is now being investigated by the U.S. Air Force, the FBI, and local law enforcement agencies to determine the facts surrounding the incident.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
EAGLE RIVER, WISCONSIN
UFO SIGHTING
APRIL 18, 1961

At about 11:00 a.m. on April 18, [redacted] was having a late breakfast in his home. (See picture) When he heard a noise which he described as a car going around a curve in a great hurry, a screeching like that of some-thing like a jet. [redacted] (also later) who stated that he had told him that it had sounded like a screeching motor car. The consensus seems to be the sound it made while coming down was in a whirling like a jet. Apparently he told [redacted] that on its way down it sounded like "knobby tires on a wet pavement." He looked out the window and saw descending a bright, chrominumcolored, disk-shaped object which he described as two soup bowls, one over-turned on the other. [redacted] stated he was not frightened by the apparition, but went out immediately because of his curiosity. When he got there, the hatch, or hatchway, was already opened. [redacted] stated that the hatchway operated something like a trunk of a car that is hinged from the top and the lower lip would coincide with the equator of the ship. He stated that when closed it was completely imperceptible, and that he would have sworn there was no possible opening there. The space ship as drawn by him is enclosed. When he came out, an occupant of said vehicle was leaning out, which and making motions with his hands suggesting that he needed water or some other liquid. That is, he made drinking motions. [redacted] was handed down a "thermos jug-like bottle" (see drawing) which he says was quite unlike any jug he has ever seen here. "A beautiful thing", he said.

Frank Sullivan, of Eagle River, Wisconsin, reports the following:
On April 8, 1961, at approximately 9:25 p.m., he and his wife were outside their home and saw a bright light in the sky. He said the light was very round and appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. It had a bright light around the outer edge and a darker center.
He said the light moved slowly and silently for a time, and then suddenly took off at a terrific speed, going out of sight in a matter of seconds.
He said one of the most amazing things was the absence of any sound from the machine. He said one of the most amazing things was the absence of any sound from the machine. He said the machine appeared to be metallic and reflected light very brightly. He estimated it was about 800 to 1,000 feet in altitude.
He said they watched the object for about 10 minutes. He said they were both very frightened and did not know what to make of the incident. He said they were unable to sleep for some time after this incident.
He DOES NOT recall hearing any motor sound, or any other noise from the object. He said the only sound was a slight humming, like the hum of a generator. 
The witness said the object was shaped like a "flattened oval" and appeared to be about the size of a car, or a medium sized household appliance. He estimated the diameter to be about 30 feet. 
The witness said a neighbor named Earl Benson, also of Eagle River, saw the object at the same time. The witness said the visit did not seem to last more than 10 minutes, and that it was traveling at tremendous speed when it left, going east.
He said the ship took off at a 45 degree angle and disappeared in a matter of seconds. He said it climbed at a tremendous rate of speed. 
The witness estimated the object was about 800 to 1,000 feet in altitude when he first saw it, and he said that as it left, the underside appeared to glow a bright orange color, about 6 or 7 inches in diameter.
He said he watched the object for about 10 minutes and estimated it traveled about 4 or 5 miles west of Eagle River for about 20 seconds.

MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION (Major Godwin) 
OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE LIAISON

SUBJECT: Reply to Congressman Reuss in Behalf of Constituent - REF: PBB UFO CASE

1. Before providing the draft of a suggested reply to Congressman Reuss in behalf of his constituent concerning this case, two independent investigations of the facts have been conducted by the U. S. Air Force:
  a. Special consultant on matters of this type, Dr. J. Allen Hynek. The results of this independent analysis by Dr. Hynek are attached.
  b. AFC Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio for scientific analysis. The results of this scientific analysis by the AFC Materials Laboratory indicated that the object was made of tin and was a fairly common natural phenomenon and not of an extraterrestrial nature.

2. The detailed description given in the inclosed newspaper article coincides with the testimony given by the witness. The press release from the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory, Madison Division, indicates that the results of their analysis were inconclusive.

3. Based on the above, it is the opinion of this office that this case could be attributable to a natural phenomenon and it is not considered to be of extraterrestrial origin. It is recognized that there may be cases of this type which could be injurious to the mental health of the individual. In such cases it is assumed in an Atmosphere of objectivity that if necessary, the individual concerned would be referred to qualified medical authorities. No evidence has been found to indicate that the witness received any hallucinations or experienced any mental disturbance as a result of this incident. Most individuals who experience these hallucinations understand them or do not make them a matter of official record.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"PUBLIC THEIR EXPERIENCES. These hallucinations may be a "psychotic" experience. According to Dr. T------, the psychologist pointed out that many individuals attributed to see some extraordinary phenomenon or event, are not a product of their own imagination. The psychology pointed out that they are indicted to their own experiences and communities to them, are not accepted for their own community and individuals. 

2. There was a great deal of publicity in the Wisconsin newspapers reporting these sightings. Many of the national newspapers/reporters, and be national association for the people for the New York Airline have been carrying story for the "Mercury-Redstone" launch. 

3. It is a matter of fact, that it is not a generally a practice to investigate cases in which there is one or observer (such cases are investigated only when very definite solution cannot be obtained). In this case, the eye-witness account is more or less diverse and a definite solution from the appearance of the object could not be arrived at. It is the opinion that a further investigation is necessary and a general estimation.

BAFL-1/MAJOR GODWIN/31/57215/14 JUN 61
BLOCK CBD 5211

Dear Mr. 

This is in reply to your letter to Brigadier General C. B. Grogan, Office of the Secretary of Defense, concerning a recent unidentified flying object (UFO) report.

The case book, according to Capt. Gregory, was involving a Mr. J----- who claims he observed an intensely bright light, surrounded by a reddish glow, hovering and maneuvering in the sky. The observer, who is known and respected as an astrophysicist, made detailed observations and sketches during the course of the investigation. However, it has not been possible to account for the indicated performance of the object under investigation. The materials Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the Geophysics Laboratory at Cambridge Research Center, and the Technical Intelligence Division at Evans Signal Laboratory have been unable to provide an explanation for the observed phenomena.

The case was the only evidence available in the case and there was only circumstantial evidence concerning the observer. No photographs were taken and it was the judgment of the investigating officers that the object as actually observed differed from the generally accepted characteristics of conventional aircraft.

A group of scientists, military and civilian, have been convened to study this case and similar reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. The Air Force is conducting extensive investigations, involving more than 7000 sightings, the accumulation and analysis of information in this program constitute part of a continuing long-range study of a phenomenon that is of great concern to the Air Force.

I hope the above information will be useful. If we can do anything further to assist your please let me know.

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs:

Her information concerning UFO problem

Recently I have been reading various articles concerning the reported sightings of and contact made with UFO's. Personally, it is my understanding that this is the actual contact which the Air Force has conducting and study, and on which they now have fairly complete information, that also the chemical analysis of samples of material from UFO's has been made by the Air Force.

I am also personally interested in some reports of UFO's in or around Beloit, Wisconsin. Unfortunately, the reports of the total reported sightings are still classified.

About how many reports coming from Wisconsin are still unknown. What conclusions have the Air Force drawn about the UFO problem.

Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Sincerely Yours,

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

I have your letter of June 1st in hand. 

The object sighted near Wisconsin "saucer" landing was investigated by a member of this office from the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, who is an experienced astronomer and astrophysicist.

We obtained two pieces of the so-called "space cake" and had specific analysis of these cases made in our laboratories. This information will be made available for any subsequent investigations or interested parties.

I hope this information will be helpful.

Cake From Flying Saucer
EAGLE RIVER, Wis. - A 58-year-old plumber of Eagle River, Dane Simonton, related Sunday that a flying saucer carrying a baked cake landed on his property on Sunday that a flying saucer carrying a baked cake landed on his property on Sunday. 
He only said that, said Joe Simonton, the cake's discoverer. A flying saucer came down in his yard Sunday and a hatch opened in the middle of the saucer. A short, dark-complected man emerged, handed Simonton a round, flat cake and motioned for water. Simonton said he gave the man a pitcher of water and in return the man handed him the cake and then took off, ascending over the ground instead of straight up.
The cake, Simonton said, was about 9 inches in diameter, one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick and appeared to be a pancake. There was no odor to it, he said, and it tasted like a wafer. It crumbled easily and had small holes in it, similar to a honey-comb. Simonton's story was told to County Judge Frank Carter, who urged him to get in touch with Air Force authorities, which Simonton said he would do.

- page 82 -

The image contains a newspaper article with text only, and no photograph. The article is titled "'Cakes Were Just Like Cardboard'" and is about a report regarding unusual flying objects that were likened to cardboard cakes in Eagle River, Wisconsin.

'Cakes Were Just Like Cardboard'
EAGLE RIVER, WIS. --(UPI)-- "Just like cardboard" was Joe Simonton's answer Monday when asked about the taste of three cakes he said were left with him by the silent occupants of a flying craft that landed in his back yard.
The three pancake-like discs are being analyzed in Washington by the National Committee for the Investigation of Aerial Phenomena.
The committee expected to have a report ready by Friday or Monday, Simonton, 58, said he filled a water jug for the "visitor" in his yard last Tuesday, and received the cakes in return. He said he kept them until Saturday, however, because of possible skeptical reactions.
He said the cakes appeared to have the consistency of corn meal. Another man who tried them said they tasted like corn meal.
Dr. Frank Carter, known as a saucer enthusiast, and Carter sent them to Washington.

EAGLE RIVER - WISCONSIN
APRIL 8, 1961
Between 1800 and 2000 hours, Mr. Theodore Bublitz reported observing a bright light moving rapidly in the sky in the Eagle River area. 
The object, he stated, appeared to change color from white to red to blue, and was accompanied by a loud humming noise. The object was visible for approximately 10-15 minutes. 
No physical evidence was discovered. The sighting was investigated and evaluated by Project Blue Book. Project Blue Book concluded the sighting was unidentified.

Here is the text from the document:

22 August 1961

Office of County Judge
Eagle River, Wisconsin

Dear Judge:

Thank you very much for your letter of July 28. I am sorry to say that I can only now have had a chance to answer it.

The case you tell me of the sighting of a mysterious object on the night of March 20 is not an isolated one, but part of an almost daily occurrence of such sightings in your area. The magnitude of these sightings seems to indicate that they must have some scientific significance, and it has become one of my chief duties to investigate such sightings and to try to discover, if possible, their real nature.

I think you understand why I stand in this entire UFO sighting as a scientist, and not as a "true believer." It is not my job to convert anyone, but rather to determine, if I can, the actual nature of these phenomena. It may be that the main job of citizens in this matter is to report sightings of these objects as accurately and objectively as possible, so that the significance of the overall pattern, if any, can be determined.

So far this does not seem to have been done. The objects, so far, defy explanation in terms of any known natural or manmade phenomena. There remains much to be learned, and we must keep an open, scientific mind. After all, organic material is certainly a rarity in the universe.

I am happy to note in your letter a well-balanced and objective attitude. This is always a very healthy sign, and gives me much encouragement. I feel that if we can maintain this attitude, and if citizens will continue to report sightings, a very much needed scientific study can be made which may eventually lead to some real understanding of this problem, which has important implications for us all.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

He took it to the basement where he had a pump and filled it with water, according to his statement. He apparently tried to get the object to sink, by doing so, he had to get up on tiptoe and put one hand against the craft, he says, and affected the transfer of the jug. He described the interior as essentially bare - - no seats, and noted that there were two men inside. The men he described as extremely clean-shaven, he said very smooth-faced, but dark and short, about 5 feet, he estimated. He said they looked like Italians. Their dress was also black, and he limited that they had turtle-neck sweater-type apparel. From his account, it seemed to me that it was more like the stereotyped picture one sees of Italian opera singers, or as he says, of the speedy set. There was no communication except by sign language between them, and as he backed away from the craft, he said he saw the interior dimly lighted, and that it was apparently beautiful. He said he would love to have a room painted in the same way. He noticed that one of the men was apparently cooking something, and in his attempt to communicate by sign language indicating that they now had water, he made motions with his mouth that they could now drink, but apparently this sign language was misinterpreted as indicating that he wanted some of the stuff they were cooking, and thereupon they handed him three or four of these little panda-like cakes, and as soon as the transfer was effected, the hatch swung down, closed with a clang, and we say they then shot up, apparently up an elevator without any apparent acceleration, except, of course, at the very beginning. And when it reached a height of some 20 feet, it just simply took off at a terrific rate of speed.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED],

Your letter addressed to the Secretary of the Air Force has been referred to this office.

The Air Force investigated the Eagle River incident and was able to obtain two pieces of the small cake mentioned in your letter. The cake was analyzed in the laboratory and the Air Force's findings are as follows:

This analysis produced the following findings:

The cake contained known carbohydrates (flour) and sugars, a stable milk protein, and contained no radioactive or unusual materials.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, astrophysicist from Northwestern University and special consultant to the Air Force, was sent to investigate this particular incident as soon as the Air Force was informed.

I hope this provides the information you wished.

Dear Sir:
We residents of the state of Wisconsin, having read at great length of the recent "flying saucer" landing near Eagle River, Wisconsin, have been much disturbed to hear that the concrete evidence which was offered in this incident (namely, three small cakes) was disregarded and not analyzed, and that no further information was forthcoming.
