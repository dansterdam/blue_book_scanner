Astro (STARS/PLANETS) V

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Four hours reported as the duration of the sighting. Multiple nights. Every night from midnight to 4 AM. (Clear nights only) light brighter than a light bulb, moves, stationary and also reported as making way at times. Observed in west. Appeared to move from North to South. Small about the size of a star. Thought to be about 150 ft. from the witness. Yellow color.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
4 Hours

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
South

Motion contrary to Star/Planet motion, however object was clear/Planet characteristics and was observed in the same place at the same hour on all clear nights. Witness reported the object to report it to the Air Force, was anxious enough to see what it was (assuming that it was within 150 ft). Sufficient data to evaluate as Star/Planet and motion regarded as incorrect.
