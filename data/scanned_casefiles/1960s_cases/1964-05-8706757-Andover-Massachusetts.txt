The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Strange Aerial Objects Still Seen In South Lawrence". The article describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object by several schoolchildren in South Lawrence, Massachusetts on May 11, 1964. 

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

UFO: (Continued)
seen there. I don't know as there
are all the details in the news-
paper story about this particu-
lar sighting, but it does describe
an interesting incident that hap-
pened in the Andover-Lawrence
area in May of 1964.  It didn't dis-
appear to nothing, but was seen
for several minutes as a strange
light, even by several people
who said it seemed to be hover-
ing in the sky for a while.  It
doesn't sound like a normal air-
plane or anything like that, so
it was certainly an unidentified
flying object, though the details
of its appearance and behavior
are not completely clear from
the newspaper account.
