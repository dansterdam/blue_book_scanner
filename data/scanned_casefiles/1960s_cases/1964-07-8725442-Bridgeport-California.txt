"R.A.S.C.
Atascadero, Calif.
D.G.I.

July 12, 1964

We have recently returned from a camping trip into the High Sierra at Bridgeport, California, which contained a rather unusual incident.

We were able to clearly observe for some 50 minutes, starting at 9:15 P.M., a luminous object hovering over a wooded area. It was disc-shaped, brilliant white in color, and approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter. It was noted by the entire family and remained quite stationary until a fairly fast dash into the distance and out of sight was made. It was about 15 degrees above the horizon and at an estimated distance of 3 to 4 miles away. The object emitted no sound and left no trail.

Our children, ages 8, 10 and 12, are quite anxious to know what they saw. We hope you can help us identify this unusual sight.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
Atascadero, Calif."

ATTN OF:	TDRVW

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 3 Jul 64, Bridgeport, Mono County, California	21 JUL 1964

TO: The USAF SAFOI (Mrs Galanti)

This is forwarding the attached letter from Mrs. --------, who has requested the investigation of an unidentified object observed the night of 3 Jul 64 by her children.

We have checked the satellite logs I and II regarding her observations, and it is possible that they observed one of the satellites in the early morning hours of 4 Jul 64. However, it is still possible that they observed one of the other phenomena which resemble satellites but may not be. It is requested that you check the files to see if any other observations were reported in that area on the same night.

We do not wish to discourage Mrs. -------- in order that her children may disclose their original observations.

Dear Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX,

This is in reply to your letter of July 22, 1964, requesting information on a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) made on July 12, 1964 in the Bridgeport, California area.

A BOAC flight was making a scheduled approach to the Bridgeport airport at 5:30 a.m. on July 12, 1964, when the crew observed a strange light in the sky. The light was observed for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. The aircraft crew stated that you observed one of the phenomena.

I regret that we cannot be more specific on this particular sighting. I suggest that you continue your interest in this field and report any further sightings to the Office of Information Division.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. JACOBS
CHIEF, INFORMATION DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION

Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX
Alameda, California
