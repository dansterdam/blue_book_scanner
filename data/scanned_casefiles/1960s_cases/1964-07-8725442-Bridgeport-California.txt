Dear Sirs:

We have recently returned from a camping trip into the High Sierra at which time we observed a satellite in orbit and we are wondering if, from the following description, you can tell us just what it was.

We were near Bridgeport, Mono County, California, on the evening of July 1st - latitude, 38°, longitude, 119°, and at 9:30 p.m. (Daylight Savings Time) observed a round, bright object moving rapidly in the sky and travelling from north to south. It was followed by a smaller, dimmer object.

Our children are most anxious to know what they saw, we hope you can help us. Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
[Signature area blacked out]

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 1 Jul 64, Bridgeport, Mono County, California                27 JUL 1964

1. Reference the attached letter from Mrs [redacted] requesting information on an unidentified object observed on the night of 1 Jul 64 by her children.

2. We have checked the satellite Echo I and II schedules and neither satellite was in the area at 9:30 pm on 1 Jul 64. These are only observable satellites on which regular schedules are published. It is possible that they observed one of the other less bright satellites, or a high flying aircraft. It is suggested that the Echo I and II schedules for San Francisco be forwarded to Mrs MacIntosh in order that her children may compare their original observation with those of known satellites.

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter of July 12, 1964. In which you requested information on a satellite observed during a camping trip to the High Sierras.

A check was made of the EGSO I and II schedules for July 1st and it was found that neither satellite was in the area at 9:30 p.m. These two satellites are the only ones really observed on which regular schedules are published.

It is possible that you observed one of the other less bright satellites or perhaps a high flying aircraft.

I regret that we cannot be more specific on this particular sighting.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
