The image appears to be a very faint and low-quality black and white document or photograph. Most of the text is illegible due to poor image quality and heavy graininess. There are some blurry dark smudges and shapes across the page, but no clear text can be discerned. The bottom of the page has a darker, more dense area that might be part of a document footer or border.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely faint and degraded. While there are some blurry shapes and shadows, the text is completely illegible. The document seems to be a scanned black and white page with very poor image quality, making it impossible to discern any specific text or details.

The image appears to be a very faint, low-quality black and white photograph with significant degradation and blurriness. There is a small dark object or shape on the right side of the image, but the details are extremely difficult to discern due to the poor image quality. Most of the page is a washed-out white/gray color with indistinct smudges and shadows. No legible text is visible on this page.


- page 10 -

The image appears to be a very low-quality, faded black and white document with significant degradation and poor scanning quality. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor image resolution and contrast. There is a small dark object or shape near the center-right of the image, but its details cannot be discerned. The bottom of the page has a dark horizontal band, which might be part of the document's border or a scanning artifact.

In August 1963 Lt Narano spoke with [redacted] regarding his unidentified observation of last summer that he observed with Moscaretolo. [redacted] said he definitely saw the object during May, June or July at about 3 o'clock. Saw it for a couple of minutes, maybe one or two minutes, but am not sure. He was standing next to a woods with the object over the trees. The trees were about two-hundred feet high and the object was about 200 feet from him. The object was silver and didn't make any noise. [redacted] didn't remember how it disappeared. It moved pretty slowly. Couldn't compare it with any objects. There was only one object. We were just in the front yard and ran in the house and t hen right back out. No one was outside. It Narano asked him why they only took one picture and he replied "I don't know." Lt Narano asked him if he had time to take more than one picture and he replied "Yes."

He doesn't belong to UFO clubs and is now 13 years old. His phone number is [redacted]. Lt Narano asked him why he didn't return the forms. "I didn't have time to return them." Lt Narano asked him if he reported it to his parents. "Yes." Lt Narano asked him when his parents would be home "I don't know." Lt Narano asked if they are home during the day. "No." He then asked if they are home during the evening "Yes, and [redacted] parents are home during the day."

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
LOCATION: Old Bridge, New Jersey                DATE: 5 April 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF          18                               QUALITY: Poor
PRINTS: One original print (8x10)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-111, submitted by Major Quintrell, IDEN/UE, requesting photo analysis to be accomplished on a photograph of an "Unidentified Flying Object" to determine what the object may be. The object was photographed in Old Bridge, New Jersey on 5 April 1967.

2. ANALYSIS: The object appears to be circular in platform and the only detail discernible is a small unidentified protuberance located at the bottom center of the object. Although the photography appears to be authentic, the object could not be identified from the available evidence.
