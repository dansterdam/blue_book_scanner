34. Date you completed this questionnaire: [Blank fields for Day, Month, Year]

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire - a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Narrative as related to the best of my ability, copying

My sister went out of the house & called the rest of us out. We looked generally to the south and saw the UFO moving to the west. It dimmed suddenly, then brightened, turning north. As it came north it kept getting brighter. It got "close" to overhead then turned east & started fading as it went, finally disappearing. During the eastward leg we heard a hum, similar to a jet getting far off. The roar seemed to be behind the object as it flew in with jets. Right after it disappeared an airplane came over (not from the direction the object disappeared in) so their might be some connection. My sister checked the clock immediately afterward and it was 10:25. We estimate we object for five minutes.

M/R: ON the morning of 19 May 65 TSgt David N Moody talked to to Mrs. regarding her observation on the night of 18 May 65. Mrs. gave the same details that were mentioned in the report given by the Duty officer(Maj James). Told Mrs. that a/c were in the area, practicing refueling and other missions. She finally agreed that this is what it could have been.
