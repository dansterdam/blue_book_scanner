JUN 19 1962

I WAS AT MY HOME ABOUT 9:30 PM ON JUNE 8, 1962 AND I WALKED OUT ON MY PATIO AND WAS LOOKING UP AT THE CLEAR NIGHT SKY WHEN I NOTICED A LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT MOVED VERY RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY. IT MADE A VERY SHARP TURN AND THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARED. SHAPED LIKE A CIGAR AND ABOUT 40 FEET LONG. I OBSERVED IT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. IT APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATED FROM WITHIN. I REPORTED THIS SIGHTING TO THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY.
