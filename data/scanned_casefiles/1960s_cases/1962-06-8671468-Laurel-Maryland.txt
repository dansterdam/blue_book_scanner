Here is the text from the document:

[Top of document has a NASA Mail Svc. JUN 18 1962 stamp and an "AFP" marking]

I was a very good night to sit on a floor or a block on a hill. Well I try to tell you what I read. I was driving, I soon in the sky and saw a fire like object.

SHAPE LIKE "SAUCER" WITH BRIGHT AURA AROUND IT. NO. I COULD NOT STOP THE TRUCK. IT WAS GOING SLOW DIRECTION OF "WASHINGTON".

POINT OF VIEW LAUREL TO WASHINGTON.

IT IS SURELY MOST "MARYLAND AND OHIO" RAILROAD NEAR TO WHAT POINT AND I LOOK SINCE. SO IT STOPPED AND RISES.

IS 650 SO THAT I AM SO VERY NEAR TO IT. THE WINDOW WAS.

AND I REALIZE WHAT I TOLD MY FRIEND ABOUT... I AM NOW VERY ANGRY AND HE DID NOT CARE SO HE I GIVE HAVE MINUTE STILL IT AND DID NOT LIKE TO MAKE.

STEP AND BACK TO WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE PICTURE OF SKY ASCENDING AND COULD NOT RESIST TO TELL IT YOU BACK AND I AM...
