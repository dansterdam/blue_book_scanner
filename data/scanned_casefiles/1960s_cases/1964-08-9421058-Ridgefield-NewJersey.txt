AUGUST 13, 1964

Dear [redacted],

This is in response to your letter of August 3, 1964 regarding the UFO sighting in the Ridgefield, New Jersey area on July 13, 1964.

Unfortunately, I passed over the new footage again on August 13, 1964 and could not find any further information on the sighting you described. It is what you saw, and your friends, but unfortunately I cannot provide any additional details.

If you have any other questions or information, please feel free to write again.

Sincerely,

MILTON W. JACKE
