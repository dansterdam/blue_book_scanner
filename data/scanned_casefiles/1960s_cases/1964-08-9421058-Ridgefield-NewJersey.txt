August 5, 1964

Dear Sir,

Would you please answer the following question for me.

I would like to know if a vehicle passed over the sky at Ridgefield on the 3rd of August, between two houses on Rt. 17.

The reason back of this question is because at about that time, probably 9:15 PM, my wife and I were driving on Rt. 17 to Englewood, and I noticed a strange object in the sky.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in response to your letter of August 3, 1964, addressed to NASA, which was forwarded to the Air Force for reply.

ECHO I passed over the New Jersey area at approximately 9:57 p.m. EDT on August 9, 1964. Undoubtedly this was what you and your friends observed. However, if the object did not make a wide U turn, it may also have been a high flying aircraft. You did not see the location in the sky where the object was seen; however, ECHO I was in the north patch, approximately 700 above the horizon, moving northeast.

Sincerely,

EASTON M. JACKS
