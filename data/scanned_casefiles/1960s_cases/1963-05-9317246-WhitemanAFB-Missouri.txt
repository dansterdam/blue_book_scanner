THREE WHITEMAN AFB TOWER OPERATORS OBSERVED THE UFO AND COULD
OFFER NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION. RELIABILITY OF THESE PEOPLE IS
CONSIDERED GOOD. COL BYERTS AND LT BOWERS WERE FLYING A T-33 WHEN
NOTIFIED BY THE TOWER OF SUBJECTUFOS. THEY SUBSEQUENTLY OBSERVED
THE UFO AND THEIR DESCRIPTION MATCHED THAT OF THE TOWER OPERATORS.
COL BYERTS FELT THAT THIS COULD BE EITHER A BALLON OR A CLOUD.
RELIABILITY OF THESE TWO PERSONS IS EXCELLENT.
L. NONE.

THESE ANSWERS ARE KEYED TO THE REPORTING FORMAT IN AFR 200-2.
