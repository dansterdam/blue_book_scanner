THREE WHITEMAN AFB TOWER OPERATORS OBSERVED THE UFO AND COULD OFFER NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION. RELIABILITY OF THESE PEOPLE IS CONSIDERED GOOD. COL BYERTS AND LT BOWERS WERE FLYING A T-33 WHEN NOTIFIED BY THE TOWER OF SUBJECTUFO. THEY SUBSEQUENTLY OBSERVED THE UFO AND THEIR DESCRIPTION MATCHED THAT OF THE TOWER OPERATORS. COL BYERTS FELT THAT THIS COULD BE EITHER A BALLOON OR A CLOUD. RELIABILITY OF THESE TWO PERSONS IS EXCELLENT.

L. NONE.
