LAREDO, TEXAS                                                Report #1

Mr & Mrs [redacted]

September 3, 1965, 7:43 to 7:45 PM. Clear Sky.
No plane from LAFB in sky at this time.

Object seen flying at about 225 degrees at a very high rate of speed, perhaps 1200 mph. Color was brilliant white. Upon reaching about 3 miles South of us, light went out. A few seconds later it appeared traveling white, appeared from near point of disappearance traveling about 800 mph headed 315 degrees. At about 20 seconds above horizon a calm to disappear. A few seconds later it again appeared from the approximate spot of disappearance except that color had turned to bright red. If approached in a direct line to where we stood to about 70 degrees height. I ran into house for binoculars, 16 x 50 over, and returned. My wife had become frightened and backed away and did see the turn actually.

I promptly picked up UFO up with the field glass, color had turned yellowish white, and object (object) then flew away at heading of about 335 degrees until I could no longer see it on horizon.

This object did not make any banks and turns, but seemed to fly straight, perhaps instantaneously, to a new course. There was no sound whatever that we could hear.

I believe that the change of light color indicates perhaps a method of propulsion unknown to me. The object pattern is a bit strange to me.

The size was about 3/4 the size of the evening star, and the object appeared to be perfectly round, like a ball.

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified objects from Laredo, Texas, during the period 3-5 Sep 65. Patterson Air Force Base has evaluated these reports as (1) aircraft, (2) meteor, (3) 4/5) have been evaluated to indicate that the four sightings evaluated as aircraft could not be attributed to normal aircraft flight. The duration, motion of the objects, and in particular the light described in Report #5 is consistent with civilian, military and civilian aircraft are equipped with a red rotating beacon which would give the visual characteristics as described in paragraph 1/2 of Report #5.

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain the present Air Force position on unidentified flying objects.

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of UFO's, the first of which I reported by telephone to a Lt. Sutton of the Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, and since he informed me that I would be contacted by Washington, I have continued to make some more observations. Today I called the Laredo Base and was told that Lt. Sutton had been transferred out some time ago, and a Captain Ellis suggested that I write to you direct with my reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is that I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would very much appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of my reports.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours very truly,

Report #2.

September 6, 1965, 9:00 PM.  E. Dodier alone.

One (1) single Amber colored object really streaking from directly West to East. Seen with 7x35 field glass for about 5 seconds, then the light went out. Speed was many times faster than any satellite that I have ever seen. (I had the peculiar feeling that perhaps by mental telepathy this particular object sensed I was watching it.)

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified objects from Mr. Emilio Bodier. The analysis section at Wright-Patterson AFB Force Base has evaluated these reports a (1) aircraft, (2) meteor, (3,4,5) aircraft. No data was presented to indicate that with the four sighting evaluations, the aircraft could not be attributed to normal aircraft flights. The duration, motion or the objects, and in paragraph 1/2 of Report #5 is consistent with this evaluation. At present, many military and civilian accounts are equipped with a red rotating beacon which would give the visual characteristics as described in paragraph 1/2 of Report #5.

LAREDO, TEXAS
September 9, 1965.                                Report #3.

From 8.17 PM to 8.32 PM a total of 5 objects, 4 of which flew
directly overhead, and one which seemed to come only from South
to North, were seen from the back yard of my home. With me were
son, _________ child, _________, and our maid. The
maid had been out already and she also saw their all with us.

No sound whatsoever was heard by any of us ( and I specifically had
requested them all to listen intently) There were no planes in the sky,
no clouds, no wind at all, lots of moonlight, and bright moon.

These objects were apparently shaped like an elongated diamond, with
amber colored lights fore and aft, and red on the left and blue on
the right. As a long distance _________ and I having climbed to the roof
of our house) I could see that they had an exceedingly bright red light
on top, which seemed to literally explode with brilliancy every two or
three seconds, after three minor red pulsations. In other words there
is no red light just on, but pulsating constantly, with every fourth
pulsation a literal explosion of light.

Four of the objects came from the North-about 20 degrees- and just
barely East of our house they circled and headed to about 340 degrees
heading. One of the objects seemed to be lighted only with amber lights
and we did not see it approach, but spotted it when it was heading North
directly West of our house, and no other color of lights were visible.
This object was joined by another which came up rapidly from the South
and they seemed to merge into one object.

Altitude seemed to be very different for all of these objects,
#2 and #3 came over at about the same time, even seemed to be in a
formation, but their individual altitudes seemed very different. #3
I could see very well with my eyes alone and with the field glasses
a peculiar shape was visible, although not clearly enough to say just
what it was. Since the object was banking, unfortunately the moonlight
struck mostly on top and sides, but enough light reflected into the
bottom to let me see a definite shape. A scooped out diamond shape.

Observations: The most interesting item is that the lights on
the bottom do not seem to glow, nor cast a corona. The seen
somehow like polarized light. On an ordinary aircraft the lights cast
out enough light so that the fuselage is clearly visible with ordinary
field glasses. Although I cannot at this time pinpoint my thoughts
there is something perhaps unreal or odd about these lights, especially
when seen up close with the field glasses. Finally, these objects made
very tight turns, almost 90 degrees. I have never seen any aircraft do
this, and my home is about 1Â½ miles South of the Laredo AFB so I have
seen many types of aircraft in the vicinity of my home for 15 years.

Report #3.

LAREDO, TEXAS

December 22, 1965

AFSC(PTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of UFO's, the first of which I reported by telephone to a Lt. Sutton of the Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, and since he informed me that I would be contacted by Washington, I have continued to make some more observations. Today I called the Laredo Base and was told that Lt. Sutton had been transferred out some time ago, and a Captain Ellis suggested that I write to you direct with my reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is that I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would very much appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of my reports.

Thank you for your attention,

Yours very truly,

[Signature and name are redacted/blacked out]

Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified objects from Mrs. Patterson. The analysis section at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has evaluated these reports as (1) aircraft, (2) meteor, (3,4,5) aircraft. No data was presented to be attributed to normal aircraft flights. The duration, motion, or characteristics in this particular light described in Report #5 is consistent with the evaluation many aircraft and would give the visual characteristics as described in paragraph 12 of Report #5.

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain the present Air Force position on unidentified flying objects.
