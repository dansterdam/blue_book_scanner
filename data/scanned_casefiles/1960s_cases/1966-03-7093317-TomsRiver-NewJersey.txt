UFD (TIGER) WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433 
22 JUNE 1966

Dear Mr.

I have your letter of June 17, 1966 regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object. I was not having written sooner, but my workload presently has been extremely heavy and I have not had the time for correspondence. I do appreciate your letter and I will try to answer as many of your questions as possible.

Your observation does not appear to be anything out of the ordinary. The tail section, elongated body, and the glow of the light or lights, are very common characteristics for a satellite. Satellites are fairly common and are visible from horizon to horizon, and this is from horizon to horizon. You also mentioned that the light was very brilliant, intermittent, and that it changed directions. This indication tends to rule out that this was a satellite. However, there are some satellites which have an erratic motion and this could be due to the angle of observation or some other factor.

I cannot accept for a fact that this was a spacecraft. There have been many reports from civilians, and I'm sure they are no more or less reliable than yourself. However, I must qualify this statement by saying that I have found that in most cases, these objects are not spacecraft. I'm sure that you will understand that the Air Force cannot divulge information concerning our own classified vehicles. Your report is the only one received for this date and location, indicating that it was probably a normal aerial vehicle or phenomenon.

Regarding your question of why it takes a week or so to inform an observer that he has made an observation, it is a good one. I would like to point out that this type of activity is so routine that it in no way indicates that we are not taking it seriously. When a report is received, it must be thoroughly checked and correlated with other observations. We must also notify our optical tracking operators, therefore we try to talk to the operator on duty at the time of the sighting. Reaching these people immediately after an observation is sometimes not possible due to the shifts in personnel.

Text from the document:

"Because a problem and of course causes a delay in the identification of the object. Another delay in identifying balloons is that we have to ask the American people to come forward and identify them. Certain details such as extreme importance in identifying balloon observations.

Militarily, of course, its very important for the good guys' USA, it would hardly a lot of people including the President of the United States. However, the public would finally be thoroughly briefed through NORAD and USAF.

I sincerely don't consider the American people bigoted or narrow-minded. There might exist in some form, on another planet or star in our universe. We ourselves were unable to locate this place. No other planet would have to state, but this is a far cry from proving it.

I'm inclined to believe that the American citizenry would accept the good news that our government would be prepared to welcome their arrival with open arms. And I am as certain as I can be that they world-wide, will detect the presence of a so-called inter-stellar space vehicle should it be en route to this planet. And I am certain that I could detect them with the naked eyes if they should display their presence in some dynamic way which would require a great power source.

As you state in your letter, and I wish that I had more time to spend in answering your questions, but unfortunately time passes much too rapidly."

Dear Sir:

Last evening, March 31, 1966, between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m., I happened to go out of my house and noticed what an unusually clear and beautiful night it was. As I looked up, I noticed an airplane traveling west at a high altitude. As I watched this plane pass under the constellation Gemini, I noticed what I had previously thought to be an extremely bright star in the northwest, begin to move. It appeared to be many times higher than the plane. I called it to the attention of my husband, and both he and my 8 year old daughter saw it. We determined it must have been a satellite, as it was very high and brilliant. As it continued to move, my husband and daughter went into the house, and I continued to watch the object move constantly in a southerly direction for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. 

At 8:45 p.m. "as near as I can reckon", as I said another satellite I had seen to travel at the same altitude. The farther away it moved, the closer to the earth it appeared to travel in an arc. This puzzled me, so I tried to find out if there were any satellites scheduled to appear over our area. I looked in the newspapers to no avail. Finally I called the Asbury Park Press, and spoke with the weather department. I asked if any satellites had been scheduled, and was told there were none. The person I spoke with also told me that the State Police had received a number of calls concerning the object from various observers, which is about all I know.

I do not know what this object was, and will not make any statements to the effect of "possible", "probable", or the like, since the sudden rush of "positive identification" in the press lately has left me a little foolish, since the sudden rush or "positive identification" in the press lately has left me a little foolish. I do not know what this object was.

BY wild guesses. I do not believe it was a plane, because of its high altitude and brilliance, and because it was not moving when I first saw it. Besides, it was traveling toward my line of vision, which could make it appear to be stationary.
I recall the circumstances in a very sensible manner, and I am always with an open mind, ready to evaluate all situations of life today, in what I believe is an intelligent manner.
Would you please inform me of your opinion concerning this matter, and also answer a few questions for me? 
Would like to know why the people that a "sighting" which took place a week or a month earlier was only reported now or articulated?
It seems to me that with all the military installations around us, they surely have the ability to make that which we have on their radar, and known beforehand that one was in the area. If they did not have the ability to communication available to them today should have enabled them to find out additional knowledge which might have been available to them.
After all this time, the efficiency of the United States Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at Thule, Greenland, and the different radar devices that are scattered all across this nation should have enabled any military base to point of impact or arrival of a missile's probable point of impact in the United States.
If our military headquarters are supposed to know what is traveling around our sides, they are pretty slow about giving the people information of simple things as weather balloons and satellites, whose course seem to raise grave doubts in my mind as to their ability to do their jobs. For example, if would have to find out that an object which was seen, but not identified a week later, and not blown up an a missile, why does anyone assume it was a missile in the first place.
Why does it take so long to inform the people as to the origin and identity of an object, when the information should have been known and ready to release an soon as any questions arose?
If there is any knowledge of the origin of the unexplained

Objects as being from this planet or others, the meaning and having that is being done only under the public mass doubtful of your explanations, no matter how true they are.
We are not all ignorant people, nor are those in the government services all geniuses. We are living in the space age, and the scope of the work done when what we are in a position to travel to other planets and build manned stations in space, so why should we be made to feel that when we are the only form of life which God gifted with the superior intelligence capable of achieving things.
We learn in school and in books now, that the sun is only one of a hundred thousand similar stars in our galaxy which can benefit a planet near it with its life giving resources. We also learn that astronomers believe that out of the 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, several million of them should be capable of supporting life, or one in every 1,500 cubic light years. Also, most of the people know that there is natural evidence of an organic form of life on Mars.
I feel the public is capable of accepting, and should be told truthfully, whether there is or is not, any chance of these objects being from other planets which are in, or outside of our galaxy.
If I may quote from a book entitled "The Universe", "Under the circumstances, one might expect that intelligent beings on planets around other stars, having reached the same conclusion as we have, that this universe could be life on other planets"), would try to communicate with their distant, probable colony some of them are trying."
I would like to hear from you on this subject. I realize that I seemed to claim any questions and doubts are in the minds of uneducated people today, when this is an urgent need for them to be answered if we are to be called an intelligent people capable of believing in our fellow men and living in peace with all, no matter who they are or where they are from.
Thank you for allowing me to take up your valuable time.
Very truly yours,
[Signature]
