35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I would like to tell you the State Police in this State are very uncooperative. When they investigated this they thought we were crazy. I am very interested in this, because I saw something I may never see again.

I am going to report this other sighting to Dover A.F.B. although I can not still name which is reported in Space 32.

thank you.

k. Remarks:

On 11 July 1966 at 2045 hours local, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] observed a large bright red object with small windows and yellow lights shining therefrom. The object was located in a hay field approx- imately 5 miles east of Kirkwood, Pa. The witnesses watched the object for a short time. It was emitting a humming noise on the inside of the object and went to the nearest telephone and asked the operator when they should call them to call the Pennsylvania State Police, which they did. The State Police did not believe their story and told them to return to the site and call it the object was still there.

Witnesses returned to the site and the entire area was dark, but the humming sound was still evident. They also noticed a tremendous amount of static on the car radio when approaching the area. They sat in the dark listening to the humming sound for a few minutes and then turned their car headlights on and toward the area. The red glow appeared again in the same spot.

Witnesses again returned to Union, Pa. and called the State Police. The Police were uncooperative and made remarks about their mental condition but agreed to send someone to investigate. They instructed the witnesses to remain in Union, Pa. until they arrived. During the waiting period of one hour both the police arrived, the witnesses noticed the entire area had a red haze in the sky which was visible for about two miles. When the police finally arrived and investigated the area from a distance of 100 feet, found no signs of the object and again began to make disparaging remarks about the mental condition of the witnesses.

On 12 July, Mr. [redacted] returned to the area during daylight hours and conducted a thorough investigation of the area but could find no signs. He wanted to have a good look around since the night before, the police had only searched the area from 100 feet away with flashlights rather than investigating closely.

On 14 July, during his investigation, TSgt Molino of 436th Mil Alft Wg Intelligence checked the hay field and noted no evidence of the hay having been damaged.

Sgt Ralph of the Avondale Barracks, Pa., State Police was contacted to establish whether any other witnesses had reported the incident. He was of the opinion that the incident never happened since there had been reports in the past of a strange beast in the same area. This beast was reported to be half man and half beast and has caused the police in this area to be uncooperative in all reports of this nature. Sgt Ralph tried to rationalize the situation by informing TSgt Molino of an early evening train shower and the appearance of a bright rainbow possibly being the answer. However, he did not answer Sgt Molino's question as to whether or not he had ever seen a rainbow in the dark.

Neither of the witnesses had been drinking on the night of the observation and both appeared to be well balanced and intelligent.

Investigation was conducted and report prepared by TSgt Robert A. Molino, NCOIC of Wing Intelligence.
