Gentlemen:

I think these two photos of an UFO will be of interest to you since the report went through your facilities. It was taken at 21:29R, on July 26B from my home.

Both photos are over-exposed through my own fault. They were taken at F 3.5, number one exposed about 8 seconds, number two from 3-5 seconds (educated guessing). The UFO appears as a thin, jerky line. The jerkiness was probably caused by nervous hands on the camera.

In photo one, the line seems to separate. This was caused by the fluctuating brightness of the object (there were no clouds in that portion of the sky), which brightened and dimmed at regular intervals throughout the sighting.

In photo number 2, the UFO appears as a barely visible line at the bottom center of the picture. The shutter was held open until the object was out of sight, below the roof.

Immediately after finishing the second photo, I contacted Martinsburg F.S.S. by telephone. You had no information indicating any object, aircraft, or otherwise, that fit my description of the U.F.O.

I want to thank you for the excellent cooperation you gave me in filing the reports with the proper authorities. You may keep the photos if you wish.

Very truly yours,

Encl.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed are two photographs of an unidentified flying object
which appeared over Cumberland, Maryland, at 0129 on July 26, 1965.
I will be glad to offer you any information I can about the sighting
and the photos.

According to the personnel at Martinsburg Flight Service
Station, Martinsburg, West Virginia, the report should have gone through
them to Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center and then to the Air
Defense Command. I don't know if it has reached you yet, but if you
need a "recap", I will be glad to supply it.

Both of the photographs, through my own fault, were grossly
over-exposed. I was experimenting with a roll of Kodak Tri-X Pan, and
for the first time, taking pictures of the stars. Both of the photos
were taken at F 5.5, the exact exposure time unknown. I would roughly
estimate about 8 seconds for number one and 3.5 seconds for the second
photo.

It will be appreciated very much if you advise me of the
results of your evaluation. Please return the negatives to me when you
are finished with them.

My home phone number is [redacted]

Your cooperation will be appreciated very much.

Very truly yours,
[signature redacted]

Encl.
