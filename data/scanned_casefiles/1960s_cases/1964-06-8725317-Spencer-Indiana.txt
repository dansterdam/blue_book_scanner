Capt. Hector Quintanilla Jr.

I don't know how to start this, but I would like to know if anyone else in or near Spencer, Indiana have heard or seen any unidentified objects? In June at 3:00 in the morning I heard some thing pass over, and I know and don't know if it went north and south or east and west. It was a whirling sound and then in few minutes. It sounded like a rocket taking off. I didn't hear it again until July and then I heard it three time from the first of July to the twenty fifth. We got up out of bed to look to see if we could see anything, but we never did see anything. If it is possible would you please check and see if there are any planes or other aircraft in the air over Spencer at that time of morning. Best regards

June 23, Ely, Nevada: Several ranchers made a close range observation of a UFO near Ely last night. One of them said the UFO was about 30 feet long and its altitude was approximately 100 feet. It was about 5 feet high and its width. There was a red sign, which had a few words which were illegible. The ranchers who made the observation were unable to capture the UFO, but they soon grew weary of the object and returned to their pickup truck.

Seaton Burn, England

Sightings at Seaton Burn

From the Newcastle-upon-Tyne
Evening Chronicle, of June 26:
"Mrs. Edwin Vipond, 'mine host' at
the Moor House Inn, Seaton Burn,
Northumberland, and his wife, Eileen,
saw something unusual.

"And before you make a crack
about the beer being too strong,"
said Mr. Vipond, "let me say that we
did not imagine this. It was quite
definitely a flying saucer."

Mr. Vipond and his wife saw the
flying saucer - time: 2 a.m. today.
Mrs. Vipond told the Evening
Chronicle: "It was a hot night and we
had the bedroom window open. Then
we heard this loud buzzing noise
like the high pitched buzzing of a
spinning top. It kept coming on and
on until I went to the window to see
what was causing it."

"I looked up and there, high in
the sky, was the source of the noise - an
electric blue light. The whole saucer
seemed to be pulsating up and down."
Mr. Vipond, who joined his wife
at the window, added: "I could
describe it in detail. The object
was moving in an east to west direction. Then it shot upward and out of
sight."

"The couple feel sure that someone
else may have seen the saucer. Sgt.
Mrs. Vipond - There was a lot of
heavy traffic on the road for that time
of the morning and someone must
have seen it."

Journal

Saint-Remy-de-Moate, France
24 July 1964

A reproduction of M. Pierre Leger's photograph which appeared in Ouest France of July 2. The photograph was taken at midnight, June 27

Mystery photograph from France

Within a ten days interval, two inhabitants of Saint-Remy-les-Nans witnessed a celestial phenomenon which could not fail to cause astonishment.

Ouest France in its issue of July 2 asks: "What was it? Perhaps an artificial satellite or even an object of extra-terrestrial origin?"

M. Pierre Leger, a designer, and his mother were returning from a visit to friends looked towards the sky when "a sort of ball of an impressive white luminosity", to quote M. Leger's own description, was seen to travel across the sky from the north-west towards the south-east. At first the object appeared to be quite large, then the object disappeared.

On Saturday, June 27, at about midnight, M. Leger was returning from the cinema when once again he saw the object, which seemed to be hovering and then advancing very slowly. He rushed into the house, called to his mother and grabbed his camera. For about twelve minutes, they both watched the object which was clearly distinguished from the stars by its great size and intensity.

Perhaps it was an artificial satellite or a shutter open I followed the convolutions of this object which moved with an extraordinary precision. Pierre Leger explained to the newspaper reporter. The Ouest France declared that it was unable to offer any explanation of the phenomenon, though in a caption to the photograph it describes it as "disturbing."

It must be born in mind that M. Leger was moving his camera with the shutter open so the image is not sharp and does not show the true trajectory. Nevertheless, M. Leger's remark that the object was much larger than any star is amply demonstrated by the width of the impression on the photographic plate.
