II. Unusual Activity: Observer was quite near a border of a jet stream at 33,000 ft.
I. None
J. None in local area at this time.
K. Mr. B. Tyrell: Lr. Lt. USAF, 3713th Def Sys Eval Sq would have possibly seen a balloon of a "pillow" shape although none were reported released in local area. The apparent repports could be caused by the angular movement of a close distance of the formation of high stratus clouds. The observer appears when the angle of reflection from the sun changed, so as not to reflect observer. The observer reports the return of negative and a final report of observation, if available.
L. Physical Evidence: See Attachments 1 and 2.

SUBJECT: UFO
ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA - PT SHIEMAN                 DATE: 29 APRIL 1966
This is in reference to your request for analysis of four prints of photographs taken along Route 55 about 9 miles east of Swanlake, New York.
Photographs in question were present at the time of exposure. There is no evidence of double exposure or evidence of any tampering with the film to alter the photograph. This appears to be a legitimate sighting.
However, a detailed analysis cannot be completed without exact focal length and range. On the other hand, the relative size of the object seen in the photographs would indicate that it was at some distance from the observer, which the photographs themselves do not appear to be the sequence in proportion.

ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA   PT.   SUMMARY        DATE: 29 APRIL 1966
This is in response to Work Order Number 6624 from Major Quintanilla (ODDR&E) who requested an analysis of a UFO report from Swanlake, New York, dated 25 March 1966. 
The object in question was present at the time of exposure. There is no evidence of a double exposure. The image size is indicated on the film. The object is small in size, similar to an aircraft.
There is no indication the photographs submitted does not appear to be the consensus in appearance. A definite analysis cannot be completed without enough detail and range.

Dear Mr. --
A definite analysis of your negative cannot be completed without the actual film and negative. The original film or negatives are required for a thorough technical analysis. The original film will be returned to you intact.
It is requested that you forward your film and negatives to the address shown below. The slides or reproductions could not be used for analysis and photographic comparisons. 
If there are any additional fees or expenses incurred, the author will be notified.
Thank you for forwarding your observation to the Air Force. It will be made a matter of record.

Reference the attached UFO report on a sighting made by

1. Dear Mr. Blunt
A film analysis cannot be computed without the actual negat
length and range (camera to object). Assuming the camera to have
taken the pictures, the distances across the object would be 3.7 inches

It is believed that you observed and photographed a Balloon.
close distances giving the impression of larger size.
balloon are launched from New York City - Albany and Buffalo, New York
reports.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the ai
additional set of prints.

The image contains a photo analysis report but does not include any photograph. The text of the report is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: THREE MILES SOUTH OF SWANLAKE, NEW YORK
DATE: SEPTEMBER 27, 1965
PHOTOGRAPHY
ITEM: 1 Negatives, 1 Prints
PURPOSE: This report is a joint response by the Photo Processing and Photo Analysis Sections of the Technical Analysis Division, USAF. The purpose is to analyze the photographic evidence submitted in connection with a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS: A finite analysis cannot be computed without the exact focal length and range of the camera used. The series of photographs submitted indicate that the size of the "plaque" to the eye was that of a peanhead to the sky. This is consistent with a very distant object as the report indicates. Considering the type of camera used, the photographic evidence submitted does not indicate a clear enough image to be analyzed for standard camera calibration parameters. Considering the type of object photographed, the location, and the distance involved, this report serves only to acknowledge receipt of the photographic evidence.
FOCAL LENGTH: 50' 100' RANGE
1" 3.9" 7.8" 
2" 7.8" 15.6"
3" 11.7" 23.4" 
4" 15.6" 31.2"
5" 19.5" 39.0"
6" 23.4" 46.8"

1 inch, 5 inch focal length is very unrealistic for this type of camera. A 3 inch focal length is reasonable but installation could result in magnification ratio's different than 3:1. Considering the computed object size at different ranges up to approximately 1 mile, the object would appear too small to analyze the detail needed for standard camera calibration.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a Project Blue Book report, with text information related to a photo analysis.

Text output:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-31 DATED 1 August 1964

Judged to be 8.2 (i) or with a 3" focal length the object would be 12.7 inches across at 20 feet or approximately 600 feet above at 2 miles.

1. Reference your letter, subject as above, dated 20 May 1966 requesting information on the camera of Mr. Cooper.

2. The camera, an Imperial Mark XII, is a simple box camera with an F stop lens (2.5 to 22) and the shutter speed will run about an F 7 or 8 lens to focal length ratio.

3. Mr. Cooper is somewhat hesitant about allowing his camera to be taken or sent to you for examination.
