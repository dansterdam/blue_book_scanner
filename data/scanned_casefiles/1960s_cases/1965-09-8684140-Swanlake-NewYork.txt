11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a white disc make a shallow dive then proceed into a climbing turn. The object was just like a bright light to the naked eye; it is uncertain what azimuth the object was spotted because the road is quite winding. The observer is uncertain of azimuth of disappearance also.

Description and photos are consistent with that of a balloon sighting.

Mr. [redacted] could have possibly seen a balloon of a "pillow" shape although none were reported released in local area. The speed reported could be caused by the angular movement at a close distance giving the impression of higher speed. The transparency of this type of a balloon would allow the rapid disappearance when the angle of reflection from the sun changed, so as not to reflect at observer. The observer requests the return of negatives or reprints of negatives and a final report of observation, if available.

L. Physical Evidence: See Attachments 1 and 2.

V66-18

SUBJECT: UFO

ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA   PT: SCHUMAN   DATE: 29 APRIL 1966

This is in response to Work Order Number 66-1 from Major Quintanilla (DSENURO) who requested an analysis of photographs taken along Route 55 about 3 miles South of Swanlakes, New York by Kenneth Lang of Brooklyn, New York.

The object in question was present at the time of exposure. There is no evidence of double exposure. With a box camera of this type, assuming a lens focal length of approximately 2 3/4" and the image size indicated on the filing the object is small if close to the camera in relative distance. In addition, the negative the observer should have been able to see the object well enough to distinguish it.

The numbering sequence of the photographs submitted does not appear to be the sequence in which the photographs were taken.

A definite analysis cannot be completed without exact focal length and range.

V63-13

SUBJECT: UFO

ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA     PT: SEAMAN     DATE: 29 APRIL 1966

This is in response to Work Order Number 66-1 from Major Quintanilla (IDE/WRO) who requested an analysis of four prints and negative taken along Route 55 about 2 miles South of Swanlake, New York by Mr. Stuart M. Cooper of Brooklyn, New York.

The object in question was present at the time of exposure. There is no evidence of double exposure. With a box camera of this type, assuming a lens focal length of approximately 2 1/4" and the image size indicated on the film, the object is small if close to the camera. In other words, if the distance were 25 feet on the negative the observer should have been able to see the object well enough to describe its size.

The numbering sequence of the photographs submitted does not appear to be the sequence in which the photographs were taken.

A definite analysis cannot be completed without exact focal length and range.

SEP 21 1966

Dear Mr. [redacted]

A finite analysis of your negative cannot be computed without the exact focal length and range (camera to object). Assuming the camera to have a three-inch focal length, the object would be 11.7 inches across at 50 feet or approximately 500 feet across at five miles.

It is believed that you observed and photographed a balloon. The speed reported could be caused by the angular movement at a close distance giving the impression of higher speed. Radiosondes released near Rochester, New York City, Albany, and Buffalo, New York. Various other types of balloons were launched from local airports.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. We are returning your negatives and prints along with an additional set of prints.

Sincerely,

negatives that were submitted to our office. In order that an 
accurate analysis may be made we need additional informa-
tion on the general characteristics as used to make pictures of the 
unidentified flying object.

a. Exact focal length.
b. F stop setting.
c. Make of camera.

DATE OF REPORT: 1 August 1966

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: THREE MILES SOUTH OF SWANLAKE, NEW YORK                      DATE: SEPTEMBER 27, 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY                                                            QUALITY: Fair
4 Negatives, 4 Prints

1. PURPOSE: This report is a joint response by the Photo Processing and Photo Analysis Team, Order Number 36-59 from Major M. Quinnella, USAF/UFO, who requested a definite analysis of a UFO observed on four prints and negatives.

2. ANALYSIS: A finite analysis cannot be computed without the exact focal length and range (camera to object).
The person photographing the UFO stated it was the size of a pinhead to the eye. This is considered to be very unlikely, as previously indicated in Verbal Report Number Y66-18.
The camera is believed to be a mass-produced type which would be given as a premium and is not of good quality or calibrated for standard camera scale. Considering the type of camera, the following is a list of focal lengths, ranges and computed object sizes for these photographs:

[Table of Focal Lengths, Ranges, and Object Sizes]

*1 inch, 5 inch or 6 inch focal length is very unrealistic for this type of camera. A 2 inch focal length is possible but unrealistic. A reasonable focal length would be 3 to 4 inches. Considering the computed object size at different ranges up to approximately 1 mile, the object is small if close, and in the case of a distant, 4 inch, etc. camera, an observer should have been able to see the object well enough to describe it better than a

pinhead to the eye (i. e. with a 3" focal length the object would be 11.7 inches across at
50 feet, or approximately 600 feet across at 5 miles).

1. Reference your letter, subject as above, dated 20 May 1966 requesting
information pertaining to the camera of Mr. [redacted].

2. The camera, an Imperial Mark XII, is a simple box camera with
no F stops to set. To find the exact focal length and F number will
require an optic lab. However, the camera seems to be set for
about an F 7 or 8 lens to focal length ratio.

3. Mr [redacted] is somewhat hesitant about allowing his camera to
be taken or sent to you for examination.
