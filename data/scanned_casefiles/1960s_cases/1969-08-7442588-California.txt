SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS COMPLETELY AND ACCURATELY. THE INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED PURSUANT TO AFRO 200-2, WHICH MAY BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS.

WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON? DAY 27 MONTH Aug YEAR 1969
WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 2 MINUTES 21 □A.M. □P.M.
WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 8 MINUTES 5-7 □A.M. □P.M.

TIME ZONE: □EASTERN □CENTRAL □MOUNTAIN □PACIFIC □OTHER

WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IN A CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A HAND DRAWN MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS. IN THE COUNTY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

California Interstate
Highway 680
In the country
Nearest landmark is Mt. Diablo

Here is the text from the document:

HOW TO GAUGE YOU AID AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, EACH BASICALLY SHOWS WHETHER THE MOVEMENT IS TOWARD OR AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER. THE LARGER SKETCH, CURVED OR CIRCULAR, IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SMALLER SKETCH.
