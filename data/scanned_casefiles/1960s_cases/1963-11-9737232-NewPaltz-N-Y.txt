Here is the OCR text from the document:

Wooten, and Larry Smith together saw
20 Leonids and 20 sporadic from Floral,
Alabama. The next morning a fireball
watch began at midnight, with 50 Leonids
and 20 other meteors, largely by the first
observers.

Carl McEllhany, Jr. and Robert La
Pierre watched on the night of Novem-
ber 16-17 from a 20 p.m. Pacific standard
time location near Rogue River, Oregon.
These watchers, California arranged
contact 178 meters.

At Wooster, Ohio, William Werner and
other members of the Wayne County
Astronomical Society recorded 70 meteors
during 3½ hours, beginning at 9:10 p.m.
CST.

The number of Leonids an observer
will count is large; the higher the radiant
point is above the horizon, if the radiant were directly overhead, he could ex-

pect 10 percent more meteors than for
an altitude of 60, 50 percent more than
at 45°, and 71 percent more than at 30°.
To make the tabulated counts of Leo-
nids comparable, they must first be re-
duced to hourly rates, and then converted
to zenith rates. Counts made when the
constellation Leo is too near the horizon
cannot be such corrected.

Corresponding to the number of meteors that a single observer
would see in a given time, the rates
are presented in this diagram. For an
observer aged 20 to 40 years, well-aged. Note how the zenith hourly rate
climbed gradually to about 19 by 12:17
on November 17th. No Sky and THE
scope records from this particular data
for the following night, so it is uncertain
from this sample just when peak activity
of the meteor shower actually occurred.

Much of the text on this page is obscured by black redaction marks. The legible text appears to be a list of numbers and fragments of text, but most of the content is not readable due to the extensive redactions. The document seems to be a typed report with multiple lines of text mostly blocked out, leaving only small portions visible.

OBSERVER'S PAGE
Universal time (UT) is used unless otherwise noted.

THIS YEAR'S Leonid shower display (1962 described in this department last January) Apparently, the maximum occurred on the night of November 16-17, but hourly rates remained below those of 1961 (see page 62).

Most observers agreed that the shower members were strikingly bright, predominantly white, with comments. "Almost all the Leonids brighter than 1st magnitude left trains that endured from two to five seconds.

The trains from these swift meteors were short, none longer than 20 degrees. All the Leonids I saw were white with just a touch of orange in about half the cases.

As in past years, fireballs were sighted along with other shower members. John Smolko, Yonkers, New York, saw a bright fireball "a bright train at 4:37 a.m. Eastern standard time on November 18th. The meteor left a train that was quickly distorted.

The table lists meteor rates by 17 observers who recorded individual counts over specific intervals. Beside each name the observing period is stated in Universal time. It is the number of Leonids counted during that interval. A few observations were made under reportedly clear skies.

One observer worked on three nights –

[Detailed table of meteor observations follows with names, dates, times, and counts]

On November 17th at 2:21 a.m. Pacific standard time, Robert Le Pierre of Whittier, California, photographed a meteor with an Argo camera set at f/5.6 and exposed for 35 mm. Argo camera set at 4/5.5 and 35 mm. A meteor shown on page 209 in the November issue. That picture was incorrectly credited to William Olsen, an observer.
