Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

This may not be of any value. Since 3 April 1960 Sunday, I have been at this times finding pieces of foil that look like radar deflectors. It is an inconceivable idea to me that an American plane should be using radar deflection over this area. I live 31 miles northwest of Salem, Ark and am under one of the Springfield, Mo. to Memphis, Tenn radio planes being and at times near the cross point of all planes flying radio beams in this area from all directions.

I am enclosing several of the pieces of foil for your scrutiny.

Respectfully yours,
Salem, Ark.

I have been putting these in my pocket book so they are crumpled.

SUBJECT:   UFO Report                                                 6 MAY 1960

TO:        SAFOI-34 (Maj Tucker)

1. The strips of aluminum foil seen by us is one of the many types of foil called "Cheat" used by the military to jam radars. This foil has been used in conjunction with training exercises which are conducted for the crews of our aircraft.

2. Foil is dropped from such an altitude that it is possible for it to drift with the wind over an area of many miles. This might have been the case in this instance, or it could have been dropped in Mr Gates immediate locality under little or no wind conditions.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 25 April 1960 concerning strips of aluminum foil which you found near Salem, Arkansas. These strips of aluminum foil were called "chaff" and were being talked to Jan radar installations. This chaff is used in conjunction with weather research conducted by the Corps of Engineers.

Foil is dropped from very high altitude and it is possible for it to drift with the wind over a wide geographical area. This could have been the case in this instance or an actual training mission could have been over Salem, Arkansas and dropped this chaff.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
