PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE
24 November, 1960

2. LOCATION
Sault Ste Marie, Michigan

3. DATE-TIME GROUP
Local: 20:37

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE
Civilian

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
1 1/4 minutes

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright orange object, size of a large star, observed at approximately 20 degrees at his speed with three stars. Couboe 210 - was 70 deg above 15 azimuth falling. Distance at 50-75 deg. A 1/20 azimuth. Speed was duration of 1 1/2 seconds. Sound trail or exhaust was normal. Tracking with naked eye. Normal lapse rate with no lateral movement.

11. COMMENTS
Speed too great for balloon although zig-zag motion of flight indicated possibility. Distance observed indicated from about 400 to 30,000 ft. Object as level of this altitude would appear to have a very small size and with the extreme observation of the "stopping" indications are that this was an aircraft flying a parabolic course with a few slight lateral motions.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Probably Balloon
Possibly Balloon

Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft

Other:
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

THIS OBJECT WAS SEEN BY TWO PERSONS AT THE SAME TIME (ONLY
ONE INTERVIEWED). THE INITIAL REPORT WAS CALLED IN ONLY A FEW
MOMENTS AFTER THE SIGHTING TOOK PLACE; (THE DELAY IN COMPILING
THIS REPORT IS DUE TO A MIX-UP IN OBSERVERS PHONE NUMBER AND THE
INABILITY OF THIS OFFICER TO REACH HIM AFTER THE INITIAL CALL-IN
WHICH WAS MADE TO SSM AIR FORCE STATION TO S/SGT HICKS. IT IS
FELT THAT AN ACTUAL SIGHTING TOOK PLACE. THIS REPORTING OFFICER
QUIZZED THE OBSERVER AT LENGTH AND HIS ANSWERS WERE ALL CLEAR
AND DEFINITE AND CONTAINED NO OVERTONES OF EXCITEMENT OR HYSTERIA
IF THE WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHED AT BISMARK ND WAS STILL AIRBORNE
AT 0532Z 24 NOV 68 WHICH IS 2532 AFTER THE LAUNCHING TOOK PLACE
AT BISMARK, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WHAT THE OBSERVER SIGHTED.
THE ZIG-ZAGGING AND APPARENT STOPPING COULD HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED
TO SHIMMER EFFECT OF A TEMPERATURE INVERSION CAUSING THE OPTICAL
ILLUSION OF ZIG-ZAG. A STRAIGHT LINE DISTANCE FROM BISMARK TO

ATO M-P AFB
K. T. SAWYER AFB, MICH

UNCLAS/ACIN-Lox 12-24/4-F

BECAUSE YOUR AER MSGN 11-6-60(A), DTD 25 NOV 60, REL BOTH WITNESSES BE RECON ACTED TO CLEAR UP THE FOLLOWING POINTS CONCERNING THEIR SIGHTING. WHEN CAST STOPPED, HOW LONG DID IT REMAIN STATIONARY? HOW QUIET, SINCE DID IT STOP DURING THE TIME IT WAS IN VIEW? THE CHANGE IN WHICH THE OBJ DISAPPEARED? THIS FACT THAT THE ELEVATION OF THE OBJ VARIED ONLY 15-20 DEGREES INDICATES THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLOSING AT A SHARP ANGLE, REQ CLARIFICATION OF THIS POINT.

HOW WAS THE DURATION OF THE SIGHTING DETERMINED? HOA A CHECK BE MADE TO DETERMINE IF A BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. SEE PAR G (7), AFR 200-2, DTD 11 SEP 59, REQ THE LATE DATE FOR SAME AREA BE FIGURED IN YOUR RPT.
