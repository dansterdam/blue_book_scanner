The object towards the top of the sky was about 3/5 ball size and moving erratically. The course was determined not to be a star or other normal object - plus the people got this close to it that they could see it was not a star or meteor. There were plumes behind it, suggesting the object had some means of propulsion. The plumes were not a trail, but a part of the object itself. There were others nearby that seemed to come and go, but the exact number was uncertain do to their speed and movement in and out of one another. Plus the people that got this close to them and were trying to observe them couldn't keep track of the exact number - but there were at least 3 or more that seemed to be a part of the entire sighting.

There is no photograph or image present in this page of the Project Blue Book report. The image shows a handwritten document with typed text at the top indicating it is "APR 60-17(C)".

The full text from the document is:

"Ye Sir got the Thdm PA about Manders There is an open yard just this side of Manders and Across this spot up the road about 1/4 to 1/2 mile there is a silo and a small barn. In front of the house I could see a tower or antenna over the roof of the house. I thought it was about 40 to 50 feet high and about 50 feet from the house. I saw a large and very yellow object hovering about 1/4 mile away and 1/4 to 1/2 mile up the hill. They looked to me like they became larger and smaller and then went down the hill. It you can use this part of the report one of these entries wrote on it to the have out by those Mowrey. Her article is called 'Stillian' and the paper is called Humanoids and this may be what happened to them and around there when this object went down the hill."

The image shows a handwritten document from what appears to be a UFO report. There is no photograph present in the image.

The text of the document is as follows:

"This is a report on an object seen at 9:30 on 07 Oct 1968.

This object was seen to the West at the horizon side. At first it looked to be a round star but suddenly a bright light flashed and then began moving fast to the west. It would stop and hover then move on. It did this for several minutes. Then it just seemed to fade out.

There were 2 of us who saw this and we are both certain of what we saw. One man said it looked to have a glow around it tho the light itself was bright and solid.
