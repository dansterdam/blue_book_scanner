14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
A lady that lives out in this canyon called her sister. Her sister ask us to go with her to look at them. There were 6 of us in my car. There were 3 other CARS parked there watching.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR:
(We left before it disappeared because they were moving down the mt. and it scared us.)

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
It seemed to move in mid ground. 3 boys went up but couldn't get near where these objects were. They are the Hanson's on Chunstick Rd. on the way to Plains from Leavenworth, WA.

37. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

By ref to other report - you go out the Plains Pd about Maries. There is an open field just this side of Hansons - AND ACROSS this field up the hill side about 1 mile away - is where we seen them. They were orange - and when large and NOT moving - when they moved down the hill they became smaller and blue-white in color.

If you contact our paper one of their editors wrote on it to - she lives out by these - Her article is called "Millie and the paper is called "Leavenworth Echo" This may help you as she tells of what happened to them AND AROUND there when these object would come to this hill side.

Leavenworth, Wa. 98826

(Phyl. Aerial Phenomena Office)
Wight-Stillson A.F. Base, Calif.

Dear Sir:

This is an answer to part of S.R. on
your questionnaire.

These objects were on the west head side
of the road up on the mountain side about
a mile - in amongst trees of them. I was
dark and a light wind was up and was able
to tell there was any smoke or noise.

These were 6 in no. in my car as I've
listed their names.

The people out in that area were also
watching it. We are an editor for the paper
Leavenworth Echo who writes only "Millers"
I don't know her personally. The Millers
live next to this field (part of) that met. put
them a long and couldn't tell what out of int-
erest got close.

It was seen about one night at the
same time for 6 days.

If you like to get a report from these
other people write out and tell me what you


- page 11 -

Here is the text from the document:

about our meet and still contact them for a
Somehow this will help.
We have seen 8 of them just about 3
weeks ago in this area going SE from the
common road - 3 of us seen them, so as
you can see it's not in our minds.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted with black marker]
