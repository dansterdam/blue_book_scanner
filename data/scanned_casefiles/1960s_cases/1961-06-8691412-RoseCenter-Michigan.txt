Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your recent card to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been referred to the Air Force.

Although your description of the sighting you witnessed sounds very much like a Fireball (astronomical) more information will be required before a definite determination can be made.

In view of this, I am enclosing three questionnaires. The additional forms are for other witnesses of this sighting when you might know.

You may return the completed questionnaires in the enclosed pre-addressed envelopes which require no postage.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

At exactly 8 o'clock in the morning on June 24, 1961 I observed what appeared to be a oblong ball of fire in the sky. At first I thought it might be a jet vapor trail, but as I have seen many vapor trails before these were prominent for some time. This trail disappeared quickly, as a ball of fire rapidly was on another route. A few miles W of where this sun rose about 30° above the horizon it appeared traveling WSW (gradually) about the speed of road.
