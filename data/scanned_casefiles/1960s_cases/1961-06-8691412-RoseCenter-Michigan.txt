The text in the document is as follows:

31 OCTOBER 1961

Your recent card to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, dated 15 May 1961, has been referred to the Air Force.

Although your description of the sighting you witnessed does not contain sufficient (astronomical) data to permit a detailed analysis, it is of interest to us and has been made a part of our files.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a handwritten document with the following text:

AT ABOUT 5:30 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON JUNE 24, 1961 A LARGE BRIGHT OBJECT WAS SEEN BY TWO WITNESSES AT ROSE CENTER, MICHIGAN. IT WAS FIRST THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A FAST MOVING AIRCRAFT OR SATELLITE BUT UPON CLOSER INSPECTION IT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING UNUSUAL. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING LARGER THAN A JET AIRCRAFT AND VERY BRIGHT, ILLUMINATING THE GROUND AROUND IT. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER A FIELD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE SUDDENLY ACCELERATING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FURTHER SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA IS BEING SOUGHT.
