27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I, this object was definitely not an airplane or copter because I have watched literally hundreds of these at night and they do not stand still in the sky and give off the bright flashing lights this object did.

It apparently moved very slowly away but it would have to be very slow and a half, and more, because I quit watching it.

I used the binoculars just to see if I could make out a form on this thing. It was not necessary to use them to see it.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One observer stated that the object looked like a star but it moved, changed color, and that he heard a noise like a buzzer. He also indicated that the object did not travel in a straight line. (See item 15 of form 17)

The other observer stated that it appeared as a star or a very small jet or airplane without its blinker on. In question 22 of the 117 he indicated that he heard no noise and does not indicate that the object traveled anything other than a straight line.

COMMENTS: Both observers are very young (age 12 yrs). The duration and direction are consistent with those of a satellite. The change of color was probably due to the atmospheric refraction of the reflected light.
