OCR TEXT OUTPUT:

This object was definitely not an explainable one. It was seen because I have watched literally hundreds of these at night and they do not stand still in the sky and give off the bright flashing lights that this object did.

It apparently moved very slowly but at no time have I been able to see it the way an airpan might for all have been visible for an arc of a half, and more. It was a quiet watching it.

I used the binocular just to see if I could make out a form on this thing it was not necessary for me to see it.

It appeared colorful and quite sizable, much larger than an ordinary object. At first it seemed solid, but later it appeared to break up, becoming like a cluster of lights or gas discharges. The object did this gradually and disappeared. The entire sighting lasted about 20-30 minutes, I would estimate.

Apparent color, size, and shape changes over this period indicated that this was not a solid object. It did not resemble any known aircraft. I felt somewhat puzzled and concerned about what I had observed.
