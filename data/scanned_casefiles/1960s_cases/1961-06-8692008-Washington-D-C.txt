10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object appeared to appear from behind the moon and then disappear back behind the moon. Appeared only as a light.

11. COMMENTS
This sighting resulted from the misidentification of the bright star Regulus (mag 1.3) during the occultation which occurred on 18 Jun. This was not a true occultation because the true occultation for a locally only be observed from South America. Although of the moon for the moon was visible from North America to cause the effect noted by this witness.
It is concluded that the sighting resulted from this near occultation.

The object appeared over the edge of the moon indicated. It was noticeably a body in the street, who called it to the attention of the boy who then watched it for a while. He watched it in the middle of the event to watch T.V., but the young kept watching. We are going to give form to the being and the story told in later.
