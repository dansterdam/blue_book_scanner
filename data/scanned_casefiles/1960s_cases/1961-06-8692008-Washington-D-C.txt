U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filled out as completely as possible, the following space is write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may use this information to summarize, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional space of the same size may be attached if this is needed.

The object appeared over the Potomac River. The witness was standing on the bank of the river when he observed the object. It appeared to come from the direction of the airport, and the witness watched it as it flew directly overhead and then seemed to settle into the river. The witness then went on foot to the location where the object seemed to land and searched for some time to give some investigation to the incident to determine if any other physical evidence might be left at that spot.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified object. The sketch shows an object with a crescent shape and a point source of light or illumination.

Text from the document:

10. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound --WHINING SOUND-----------
b. Color --EXTREMELY BRIGHT---------- 

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, proturberances, etc., and specifically mention trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

THE OBJECT WAS CRESCENT SHAPED
WITH A BRIGHT POINT SOURCE 
IN THE MIDDLE EMITTING A
HALO OF LIGHT AROUND IT

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright light
c. Sharply outlined d. Other POINT SOURCE

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ONLY ONE
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image shows a page from what appears to be an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Producing the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "30" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object.

A BRIGHT STAR OF A LARGE SATELLITE. SUCH AS ECHO 1.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A-B" and a sketch of an object above the horizon. The instructions direct the observer to place a mark "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen, and a mark "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when it was last seen.

The second sketch contains two larger illustrations. The left illustration shows a landscape with a person standing in the middle of a road. The instructions state that this sketch represents the position of the object when it was first seen, and the mark "A" should be placed on this sketch. The right illustration shows a smaller landscape view.

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
