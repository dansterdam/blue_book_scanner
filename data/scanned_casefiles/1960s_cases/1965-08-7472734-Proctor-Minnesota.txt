Dear [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

A search of our case files indicates that the Air Force received only one UFO report from Minnesota for the period 2-10 August 1965. This report came from Proctor, Minnesota, and was evaluated as a radiation of the area, Arkansas.

I am enclosing a copy of the Air Force evaluation of the Mentell Case which you requested.

Sincerely,

To whom it may concern,

Thank you very much for sending several summary and STRO form 164, which I appreciate very much. I am not on touch with ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) if my plane and me the address, I will be more than happy if you will do that. Also could you send me the Report on Thomas Mantell, the one who crashed while chasing a UFO in 1953?

I'm sure that you have been informed of the amounts of sightings which took place in St. Paul and Minnesota during August 2-10 of 1965. Could you send me the report on the 2nd tell me, if possible, your own explanation of the UFO's? Do you have in your possession yet the substantive report which was sent to St. Paul in Minneapolis?

Reference the attached letter from Mr. >requested
information on unidentified flying objects. We have researched
the case files and find only one report from the period of
2-10 August 1965 from the Minnesota area. This report came
from Proctor, Minnesota and was evaluated as a refraction of the
star Antares. Records indicate that a request has received
the current fact sheet; however he has requested a case summary
on the Mantell incident.
