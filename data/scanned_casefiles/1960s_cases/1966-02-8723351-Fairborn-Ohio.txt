MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL FROM [REDACTED] REGARDING OBSERVATION ON SUNDAY
20 FEBRUARY 1966.

Sgt Jones spoke with M[REDACTED] of [REDACTED], Fairborn, Ohio on 3 Mar 66 regarding his observation of 20 Feb 66, at 1:40 pm. Object was going terribly fast. Illusionary thing. Couldn't judge height. Appeared to be a canopy falling off and towards earth then the thing level out and flew away. At first he thought object was going to either fall in his back yard or his neighbor's back yard. Dark inking black exhaust changing to white, one second pulsating. Came from North almost going directly South.

Couldn't tell height, object had a funny way of concealing height, it was like it was intelligently controlled. Weather was clear. Wind was going same directions object.

Thought at first they were experimenting from the field (WPAFB). He called the television station and said that he would verify an unidentified object if anyone else saw one.

He has a book on flying saucers by Adamski and in this book there is a picture like the one he saw. M[REDACTED] asked that we not reveal his name. We replied that no names are given out.

A Form 164 was sent to M[REDACTED] on 3 Mar 66
