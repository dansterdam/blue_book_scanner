My Star - getting in mostly but this thing first appeared in lower 5 sky below what I took to be Mars?

[Diagram with annotations]
* Mars
* Object
*** Orion's belt

It is April 3 sighting, we felt that had been an air circular pattern between here and that might have been lights we'd have heard engines or seen lights seemingly just to circle and planning. Somehow convinced us it was not an airplane or any craft.

It occurs to me it could have been a stray weather balloon, which, if being blown by a wind, might explain its erratic, etc.

Dear [Recipient]:

Enclosed are the completed forms we spoke of on the telephone April 19.

I would like to do a story on Project Blue Book in general, pegging it, if possible, to an evaluation of the two sightings made by me and my wife. This would add some personal color to the thing and perhaps make it more interesting to my readers.

Thanks very much for your help. I'll look forward to hearing from you when you have some information on the enclosed.

Yours truly,

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    23    April    63

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Time (approx) not unimportant, because on this occasion I took notes as to color, size and degrees off horizon and course etc...

We had no way of estimating actual altitude or speed, of course, but we had an impression that it was very high and moving very quickly. I think we felt this because had it been an airliner, moving across the horizon, it would have been the engines that bright, not the whole craft.

My wife noted at the time that if it had been an airplane "we'd have seen lights blinking". She confirmed my impression that it looked just like an S star except it was obviously not a shooting star.

I spent time of passage - we discussed - I think it was some time like 2 minutes. They were thinking to between 1 and 2. I was watching it until after we'd been lighting at it for a while.

I suppose it might have been a satellite.
