10. CONCLUSION
(REFLECTION OF GROUND LIGHTS)
Conclusions by investigating officer was in all probability, an
optical illusion created by reflections of lights from the ground
off the inversion. The object appeared to rise as the inversion
layer rose when it was effected by the rising sun. The object
was in a horizontal direction due to the dissipation of the inver-
sion layer due to the reaction of the rising sun or the movement of the layer
over the body of water (Galveston Bay) east of Houston.

Object was estimated to be 30-50' long, oval with points at top and
bottom, and each end where lights were located. Object was a
bright white (difficult to look at). Change to orange occasion-
ally. Lights on ends were blue and occasionally change to bluish-
green. Lights on top and bottom were red and occasionally changed
to green. Experienced with first noticed was estimated to be 3/4
mile away. Object appeared to be to left and right, forward and
back, always returning to approx the same location. After about 1
hour what seemed to be a continuation of a forward and climbing
path which resulted in an angle of approx 45 deg. Object traveled
away from the viewer. While performing this maneuver, the object
was described by the viewer as "dripping light".

INVESTIGATION:

1. Corrections/Additions to Original Report:
a. Size was estimated to be 30-50 feet long.

b. Shape was oval with points at top and bottom, and each end where lights were located.

c. Color of main object was a brilliant white (difficult to look at). Change to orange occasionally. Lights on ends were blue and occasionally change to "blush-green". Lights on top and bottom were red and occasionally changed to green.

d. Distance from viewer when first noticed was estimated to be 3/4 mile.

e. Movement of object: appeared to be to left and right, forward and back, always returning to approximately the same location.

f. Object disappeared after about one hour by what seemed to be a combination of a forward and climbing flight path which resulted in an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The object traveled away from the viewer. While "reforming" this maneuver, the object appeared to break up into 2 or 3 parts which were bright lights and were described by the viewer as "dripping lights". The object then disappeared from sight traveling in an easterly direction toward the rising sun.

g. Object viewed through binoculars (7 x 50 power) and was seen by four other persons. No pictures were taken.

2. Weather Conditions:
Ellington weather records revealed that there was an extremely strong substance inversion from 3000 to 5000 feet which was caused by an abnormal increase in temperature and a rapid decrease in moisture. This inversion was so strong it caused extensive false echoes on the weather radar.

CONCLUSIONS:
The UFO was, in all probability, an optical illusion created by reflections of lights from the ground off the inversion. The object appeared to rise as the inversion layer rose when it was effected by the rising sun. The object appeared to "break up" either due to the dissipation of the inversion layer due to the reaction of the rising sun on the movement of the layer over the body of water (Galveston Bay) east of Houston.
