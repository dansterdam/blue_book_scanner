SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED RADAR SCOPE PHOTOGRAPH

TO: COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR FORCE CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH CENTER

As requested in telephone conversation of 7 October, the following information has been obtained:

The object, as exhibited on the radar scope photograph, appears to be unidentified. The object was tracked to a range of approximately 1.8 nautical miles from the radar site. At this range the object appeared as a well-defined, solid return on the radar scope and seemed to be at an altitude of 4,000-5,000 feet. The object moved in a straight line, apparently under positive control, at an indicated speed of 240 knots.
Since the information given is the only data available on this particular sighting, no further analysis can be made at this time. However, the photograph has been carefully studied and no meteorological or other natural phenomena can be identified as the source of the radar return.
