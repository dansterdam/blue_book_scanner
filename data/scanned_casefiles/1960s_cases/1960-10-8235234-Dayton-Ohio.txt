At 1150 hours 26 October 1960, the following information was secured:

While being south, a point of light, blue with red around it, was seen in the western sky. It was about 35 degrees elevation, and swifts down to its descent toward the earth, where it disappeared. There was no tail observed. The brightness of the object was about that of the stars. The object was in view for about 2 seconds.

There have been no other reports of this object being seen, and the boy was by tall. From the information reported, it appears that the object was a meteor.
