Mr. and Mrs. and were parked in a lover's lane area approximately 4 miles north of Weston. The automobile lights were not running. The object flew overhead but they could not determine the size nor altitude of it. They stated it made two runs over a point for a short period of time. When Mr. got out of the car to watch, the object flew away. They sat and watched for about 10 minutes. When Mr. got back in the automobile, the object came back in the same direction. These lights were one above the other and were brighter than any search lights. Mr. and Mrs. thought they observed for about 5 minutes. When they returned for a closer observation, the object took off and stayed to one side of the automobile for about three miles. The lights from the object appeared to light up the surrounding area. About one mile north of town the object took off and was gone. This same object has been sighted on three or four occasions prior to the reported one and appears. Has also been seen by an individual who accompanied Mrs. on the previous occasions. The object remained on the ground for approximately 10 minutes. If Colonel Hagan is contacted, he will confirm that a helicopter from Whiteman AFB could recognize the object as a helicopter. Miss will confirm that the object was seen, and they did not mind Mrs. mother insisted that she report it, and they convinced he. Colonel Hagan says this is a good opportunity for anyone who is interested in seeing a flying saucer.
