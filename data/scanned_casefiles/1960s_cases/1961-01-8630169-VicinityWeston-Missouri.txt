Mr. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] were parked in a lovers lane area approximately 4 miles north of town. The automobile lights were off and the motor was not running. The object flew overhead but they could not determine the size nor altitude. Was sighted in the woods to the north over a mile away. They watched while it landed. There was a red light - not distinct - more like a glow. They sat and watched for about 10 minutes. When Mr. [redacted] got out of the car, the courtesy (ceiling) lights came on in the auto. When this happened, two lights came on in the object and pointed toward the auto. These lights were one above the other and were brighter than any search lights Mr. [redacted] had over seen. They showed for a 50 feet radius. When this happened, Mr. [redacted] got back in the car and started towards town. The object also took off and stayed to one side of the automobile for about three miles. The lights from the object were so bright that [redacted] tested his headlight several times to see if they were operating. Headlights were dim in comparison to the lights from the object. About one mile north of town the object took off.

This same object has been sighted on three or four occasions prior to the reported one and on several occasions since then. Has also been seen by an old farmer who accompanied Mr. [redacted] to the scene. On the other occasions, the bright lights were not showing. The weather was clear. The object remained on the ground for approximately 10 minutes.

Lt Colonel Hagerty suggested that it was possibly a helicopter from Sherman Field, but [redacted], being a mechanic, feels that he would recognize a helicopter. Mr. [redacted] will confirm this story.

Lt Colonel Hagerty says that Mr. [redacted] is willing to accompany anyone who is interested to the scene.

Mrs. [redacted] mother insisted that the report be made, and they convinced Lt Colonel Hagerty that they had something. He feels this is a good opportunity for anyone who is interested in seeing a flying saucer.
