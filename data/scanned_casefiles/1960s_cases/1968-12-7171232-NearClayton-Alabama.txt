The image contains two photographs. The first photograph appears to show an unidentified object that was observed near Clayton, Alabama. The object is described as having a "clear plastic except for a dark patch at one end" and "what appeared to be a dark gondola underneath". The second photograph shows a blurry landscape, likely the area where the observation occurred.
