The document contains a photograph of a "Flying Saucer from Mars" that was recently discovered, according to the text. The photograph shows an object that is described as a "Citadel" or "Clytabie", which is said to be around 36-1/2 feet in size and fly at altitudes of about 1,000 feet. The text provides a detailed description of the characteristics and behavior of this object, including its structure, light patterns, and ability to be mistaken for other types of aircraft.

WILLIAM S. KEITH: Philosophy Instructor, University of Pittsburgh, Bedford Campus. Three state physics training at MIT in philosophy. He has published accounts of various phenomena of parapsychology, telekinesis, and UFO observations during the summer of 1966. He has given two talks.

J. DOC. KAISER: Opthalmic Technician with Dr. Han, Han 3r., U.S. Marine Corps. Witness of burned retina of UFO sighting, who suffered eye damage. One of three Institute people who are closely in handle ongoing UFO fighting, reported to answering service (telephone number 391-2765).

FLYING SAUCER FROM MARS DISCOVERED

An on-the-spot Institute investigation recently verified the existence of a "Flying Saucer from Mars," which has accounted for many UFO sightings in the Pittsburgh area. The object is a Citadel or Clytabie, according to Fred Hiller, Canonsville Airport, and bears the above quoted inscription with the qualification "Te.",as it still retains after "Warn" for the Polish Aas by Adc Inc.

The wingspan of the Clytabie ("Clytabie" spelled backwards) is 36-1/2 feet. It usually flies at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, around 70 mph, and can stay aloft over five hours. Mounted below the wings is a framework of wires to which are soldered 7 rages of 36 GMI bulbs, the size of a flashlight bulb. A heavy tape with holes punched in it is used to spell out a message, runs through a machine inside the plane, which makes the message move across the lights. An air screw mounted below the plane is something used to attract attention...

On 7 Aug 65 a white disc shaped object was seen at 1950 hours (7:50 PM) by a witness  The object was about 25-30 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes. The witness said it was very bright, giving off a bright glow. It was traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. The object turned slightly and moved up and down an up and down movement. There were some fuzzy areas around the edges of the object. As it moved off there was a slight trail behind it. The witness said it was very bright, plus and there were some fuzzy areas around the edges. The object was observed from the back porch of the witness' residence and the object was flying low to the horizon. The object was first observed when it came from the east and was visible for just a few seconds. The witness said the object was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen. 

Reference sighting by Miss......., Pittsburgh, Pa. 
The witness stated she was on her back porch and observed a bright, round, luminous object about the size of a bread pan hovering near the horizon. She said the object was larger than a star and had a bright glow around the edges. The object remained stationary for about 10-15 minutes and then gradually faded out of sight. The witness said the object was silent and did not appear to move during the observation.

(Possibly this could have been some type of conventional aircraft, although the description seems to indicate an unconventional aerial object).

Text output from the document:

22 Jul 65 At approximately 2030 - 2100 hours this date many alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects have been received from individuals also down to the Pittsburgh area.  The observations, other reports and investigations conclude therefore that the main reason for the sightings was consistent with the summer phenomenon when many light object are seen due to the conditions.  The observations and investigations conducted. The observations and investigations conducted.  The observations and investigations conducted.

25 Jul 65 Several reports received from residents of the Pittsburgh General Distribution center that observe a 'strange object' in the sky in various directions.

27 Jul 65 Several reports received from local residents.  Orange light sighted 2130 and 2300 hours.  Sphere type object seen dark and light sometimes hovering.  Object checked further, unidentified. 

1 Aug 65 Several reports received.  Silver sphere object sighted, small, oval, windows seen.  Further questioning revealed report unreliable.

2 Aug 65 Report received of high altitude object white, round, size of football in shape, no sound, about size of north star.  

7 Aug 65 Report received, red object sighted traveling at a fast rate for a short time then disappeared. Further investigation revealed mirage.

11 Aug 65 Report received, round shaped bright orange object maneuvering, could explain away as aircraft maneuvering, object moving at a fast rate of speed. Further investigation revealed mirage.

SUMMARY: The inspecting officer has observed nothing to date. All physical sightings of an unrelated observation have been investigated and in most cases have been explained in the natural or known phenomena, because of the number of reports. Form have been reproduced for further information to the information of the public. SAPOI has been contacted and the current report submitted. No further action required. The observatory has been contacted and informed to continue to assist in investigating all other similar reports.
