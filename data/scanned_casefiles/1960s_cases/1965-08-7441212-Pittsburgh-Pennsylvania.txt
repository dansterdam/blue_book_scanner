22 Jul 65     At approximately 2030 - 2100 hours this date many calls were
               received from individual, also News Media concerning observations
               of UFO's. The general description, cigar shaped with red exhaust.
               The Weather Bureau, PA, Allegheny Observatory and Pullman
               were contacted. The Observatory and Planetarium concluded that
               the objects sighted were Meteor Showers. News Media published same.

25 Jul 65     Several reports received from residents of the Pittsburgh area.
               General description, oval shaped orange disc's traveling in various
               directions.

27 Jul 65     Several reports received from local residents. Orange spheres
               sighted 2130 - 2200 hours. Sphere rotated back and forth, stopped,
               then rotated and disappeared over the horizon, no flare, no haze,
               also reports of cigar shaped objects, same type reported 22 Jul 65.

1 Aug 65      Several reports received. Silver sphere object sighted. One report
               stated silver shaped saucer, small oval windows seen 1630 hours.
               Further questioning revealed report unreliable.

3 Aug 65      Report received of high pitched whine heard 0335 hours. However,
               individual saw nothing.

4 Aug 65      Report received of red haze in the sky 2140 hours. Object sighted
               football in shape, no sound, about size of north star, disappeared
               over horizon.

7 Aug 65      Report received, red object sighted revolving as it traveled. Object
               brighter in the center, moving at a fast rate of speed.

11 Aug 65     Report received, round shaped bright orange object moving at a
               fast rate of speed, made a whistling sound, came down low and
               flew over residence. Also another report of flying saucer type
               object moving at a fast rate of speed. Further investigation
               revealed report unreliable.

SUMMARY: The inspecting officer has observed nothing to date. All reports
are checked and most reports to our knowledge are unreliable and possible hoaxes.
Publicity recently given UFO's we feel has stimulated telephone reports and
because of the number of reports, forms have been reproduced for collecting
individual information, which is checked further by the Information Officer at a
later date. No releases by this organization concerning UFO's have been made
to the news media. SAFO has been contacted and the current report on Project
Blue Book has been received. Names, addresses and phone numbers of observers
reporting UFO's are kept on file. The FAA, Weather Bureau, other military
installations in the area, Allegheny Observatory, Pullman Planetarium have been
informed to contact this organization when UFO's are sighted.

William B. White: President, Philosophy Instructor, University of Pittsburgh, Bradford Campus. Three years physics training at MIT; BA in Philosophy. NICAP staff member during summer of 1966. Published account of Portage County (April 17, 1966) UFO/police "chase"; has given 16 talks.

J. For Kiler: Ophthalic Technician with Drs. Mann, Lion Ste., and Sharrer. Former MC with U. S. Marine Corps. Made pictures of burned retina of UFO witness, who suffered eye damage. One of three Institute people who are ready to handle on-going UFO sightings reported to answering service (telephone number 391-2756).

FLYING SAUCER FROM MARS DISCOVERED!

An on-the-spot Institute Investigation recently verified the existence of a "Flying Saucer From Mars," which has accounted for many 100 sightings in the Pittsburgh area. The object is a Citabria Champion advertising plane flown by Fred Kiler, Gainesville Airport, and bears the above quoted inscription with the qualification "p." in small letters after "Mars." Mr. Kiler owns AAA Sky Aids, Inc.

The wingspan of the Citabria ("Citabria" spelled backwards) is 36-1/2 feet. It usually flies at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, around 70 mph, and can stay aloft over five hours. Mounted below the wings is a framework of wires to which are soldered 7 rows of 36 C15I bulbs, the size of a flashlight bulb. A heavy tape with holes punched in it to spell out a message, runs through a machine inside the plane which makes the bulbs light up in a certain sequence, to make the message move across the lights. An air siren mounted below the plane is sometimes used to attract attention.

In a strong headwind, at an airspeed of 30 mph, the Citabria can appear to be standing still. Seen on edge, its lights, moving from one side to another, can give the appearance of a flattish object with a row of lights around the rim. The engine of the plane is inaudible at a distance from which the moving lights can be easily seen; thus, many people report seeing a silent, disc-shaped object with a rotating rim covered by small, colored lights. When the plane is flying directly toward or away from the observer, especially in a misty atmosphere, its appearance can be quite eerie. It can, as several reports have stated, definitely not resemble any conventional aircraft.

             then rotated and disappeared over the horizon, no flare, no raise,
             also reports of cigar shaped objects, same type report 22 Jul 65.

1 Aug 65     Several reports received. Silver sphere object sighted. One report
             stated silver shaped saucer, small oval windows seen 1630 hours.

               received from individuals also News Media concerning observations
               of UFO's.  The general description, cigar shaped with red exhaust.
               The Weather Bureau, FAA, Allegheny Observatory and BUHL Planetarium
               were contacted.  The Observatory and Planetarium concluded that
               the objects sighted were Meteor Showers.  News Media publicized same.

25 Jul 65    Several reports received from residents of the Pittsburgh area.
               General description, oval shaped orange disc's traveling in various
               directions.

27 Jul 65    Several reports received from local residents.  Orange sphere
               sighted 2130 - 2200 hours.  Sphere rotated back and forth, stopped,
               then rotated and disappeared over the horizon, no flare, no noise,
               also reports of cigar shaped objects, same type reported 22 Jul 65.

1 Aug 65     Several reports received.  Silver sphere object sighted.  One report
               stated silver shaped saucer, small oval windows seen 1630 hours.
               Further questioning revealed report unreliable.

3 Aug 65     Report received of high pitched whine heard 0335 hours.  However,
               individual saw nothing.

4 Aug 65     Report received of red haze in the sky 2140 hours, object sighted
               football in shape, no sound, about size of north star, disappeared
               over horizon.

7 Aug 65     Report received, red object sighted revolving as it traveled.  Object
               brighter in the center, moving at a fast rate of speed.

11 Aug 65    Report received, round shaped bright orange object moving at a
               fast rate of speed, made a whistling sound, came down low and
               flew over residences.  Also another report of flying saucer type
               object moving at a fast rate of speed.  Further investigation
               revealed report unreliable.

SUMMARY: The inspecting officer has observed nothing to date.  All reports
are checked and most reports to our knowledge are unreliable and possible hoaxes.
Publicity recently given UFO's we feel has stimulated telephone reports and
because of the number of reports, forms have been reproduced for collecting
initial information, which is checked further by the Information Officer at a
later date.  No releases by this organization concerning UFO's have been made
to the news media.  SAFOI has been contacted and the current report on Project
Blue Book has been received.  Meaney, addresses and phone numbers of observers
reporting UFO's are kept on file.  The FAA, Weather Bureau, other military
installations in the area, Allegheny Observatory, BUHL Planetarium have been
informed to contact this organization when UFO's are sighted.

25 Aug 65    Report of UFO received from Mrs. [redacted], Pittsburgh, Pgh. 15110, (address redacted) who observed a white disc shaped object at 1050 hours moving across the sky. There was that one object which was round and seemed to move somewhat erratic. Mrs. [redacted] was in her back yard, about the size of a half dollar, moving very fast.

30 NR. [redacted] has no sound. She was looking out her living room window to see the sky and clouds. She saw a very clear, blue sky. There were some fluffy white clouds. Object was below the clouds. The clouds were not moving but were stationary. Mrs. [redacted] was on a hill overlooking the country and the object was flying low to the horizon. Mrs. [redacted] can see the sky well, rising her head at about a 45 degree angle. The object was seen for about 10 seconds.

31 Aug 65    Reference sighting by Mr. [redacted], [location redacted]. Mr. [redacted] was contacted. Jenkins, Arcade, Pa. (Pittsburgh) stated that to date no final evaluation on Mr. [redacted]'s sighting has been made. There had been some visual trip in the sky and a slight remembrance in the observer's mind as rather hard to explain and possibly not truly a happening.

30 Aug 65    Report received from [redacted], Crafton Hills, [redacted] stating that about 1930 hours while sitting in his living room in a white house at the back of the yard, he first noticed an object through his window. Object was round, white, and looked out of place. [redacted] Hills, saw it. Object was white in color, stationary. He was curious and went outside to ask his neighbor what it was. Back to ask his neighbor, he saw the object in the sky. They threw objects at it and a search light. They ran home. The boys ran in opposite directions. After seeing the old glow, they ran home and asked a friend to go back and when they did, with the aid of a flash light, they found nothing. Later he said he saw the object for about 15 to 30 seconds. Mrs. [redacted] stated the ground and weeds in the area saw the object were flattened down when the object left.

Possibly this could be some type of swamp fire and won I asked that [redacted] and if there was rather good in the area, I do not know.

29 Aug 65     Report of UFO received from Mrs. [redacted]; [redacted]
[redacted], Pitcairn, Pall. [redacted], observed a white disc shaped object at 1050 hours moving
across the sky. There was just one object which was round
and seemed larger than commercial planes which fly over the
area, about the size of a half dollar, moving very fast,
SW to NE.  There was no sound. Object was seen when Mrs.
[redacted] her living room window to see the sky and clouds.

The sky was clear, blue and there were some fifty white clouds.
Object was below the clouds. The clouds were not moving but
were stationary. Mrs. [redacted] was on a hill overlooking the
country and the object was flying low to the horizon. Mrs.
[redacted] can see the sky well, raising her head at about a 45
degree angle. The object was seen for about 10 seconds.

31 Aug 65     Reference sighting by Mr. [redacted], Teva Baugh Road,
Baden, Pa. (Telephone [redacted], 13 Aug 65 [redacted]
Jenkins Arcade, Pittsburgh, Pa. [redacted] was contacted.
Dr. [redacted] stated that to date no final evaluation on Mr.
[redacted] was made. However, he did state that
there had been some vision drop in one eye and a slight
hemorrhage in the other eye which is rather hard to explain
and possibly not fully a hemorrhage and does not look like
radiation burn. Further studies are being made. Dr.
[redacted] saw Mr. [redacted] one week after his situation appeared.

30 Aug 65     Report received from Mrs. [redacted], [redacted],
Penn Hills, [redacted], stating she had seen a glowing man or
humanoid in her back yard between 1100 - 0130 hrs. When she
saw it, it was lying down in some bushes at the back of her
yard. She saw it from about one mile's view and then came back
of the window. The object was brought to her attention by
two young boys.

She lives upstairs at [redacted] residence.
[redacted] who lives next door was called in to look. She and
his friend [redacted] to walk him home. They threw objects at
it and as they started to leave, it took a jump toward them.
The boys ran in opposite directions. [redacted] described
it as being a "fast walk human figure" with a bright glow. After
ran home he asked a friend to go back and when they did, with
the aid of a flash light, they found nothing.

(Possibly this could have some type of swamp fire and when I
asked what type brush and if there was rotten wood in the
area, Mrs. [redacted] didn't know.)
