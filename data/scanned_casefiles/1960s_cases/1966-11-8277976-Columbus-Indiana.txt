34. Date you completed this questionnaire:     12   11   66
                                               Day   Month  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

For several weeks of time since incident I was so afraid and angered by several things like. When I would be talking on my phone and when the conversation would get to my sighting that object, I began to notice that every few seconds (20-30) I would hear a bop on the line, this made me feel my phone was tapped and I did not like it.

Or how about the mail pick-ups at the corner by a man with US air force pick up truck each morning for about 2 weeks. Or the two men who came to sell hardware door to door with agencies with who did introduce some the force of what they were selling and asked my wife many questions about the sighting? Or the 65 Chrysler sedan that followed me from home to work and back home for 3 days?

These and other things happening caused me to be reluctant to send this report in at all.

On Dec 4, 1967 while I was driving home from work in Indianapolis I saw another object the same size and shape as the one 30/11/66.

2 mi south of Franklyn. Lit at 7:10 in eve. It was about 500 ft alt, over a housing development 1/4 mile west of U.S. 31.

It was in view for 10 min just kind of drifting around in about a log mile area. From time to time a very bright spot light about 3 ft in dia at the object would shine down. The craft moved around at 30-50 mph in a pattern like it was searching for something.

At one time it flew over my head and I saw on Drgna like this at about 15 ft high in dull Red Point. (3 stripes with a 5 point star below)

Just before it flew away it made a flight pattern like and if blowing N.W. at a great speed.

I did not report this sighting to the authorities because of all the notoriety from the last time. I still hope that the image I saw means something to you. It doesn't to me.
