11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers spotted 4 objects in the northern sky that seemed to be clouds. The objects appeared as if they were glowing and surrounded by a glow. The objects seemed to be moving in a southerly direction at altitudes below 20,000 feet. There seems to be no reason why the objects could not have been clouds despite the fact that the observer did not see any other clouds in the sky.

On the night of December 6, 1967 at approximately 2:30 or 3:00, the witness was outside on the patio waiting for a barbeque fire to burn to the point where the coals could meet upon the grill. The witness observed several objects in the sky that appeared to be moving rapidly and blinking on and off. The witness noted that there was not one cloud in the sky as far as he could see. The objects appeared to be due north of the witness and over the house behind the residence. These blurred objects appeared to suddenly and silently move in a straight line across the sky. The witness stated that the immediate area around, above and below the objects seemed to be illuminated by a thin cloud or smoke. The wind was blowing the cloud and approximately 100 yards from the objects the cloud or streamers of cloud-like material dissipated. The objects appeared to move at a speed of 1 to 2 miles an hour and seemed to hang in the sky. As they reached an overhead position, the witness thought that whoever or whatever they were, appeared to be looking them over. The witness could not get a good picture of the objects as they were over the house and he could not get a clear picture. When the witness realized the lens opening was not proper, so when it took the picture, the image was blurred and the speed of these objects had appeared.

On Monday the 4th of December, the witness was again outdoors and he stated "how did you like the weekend?" and he stated "wasn't it beautiful out?" The witness replied, and a funny thing happened - I described the cloud formation and he stated that it happened about 2:30 to 3:00 and I said yes, it did and then he stated that he saw the cloud formation on the Saturday night when this sighting occurred.

On November 25, 1967 the witness was either fortunate or unfortunate in observing the positioning or placing of a platform above the south-central United States. It was a confidence on something of something to be commanded when these objects appear over the house, approximately 2:30 and 3:00 when this occurred, I was not there.

Looking at the sun, visibility was unlimited. I was not tired, the lenses of my glasses were not clouded, the neighborhood of my house was in the neighborhood of these objects. Sincerely yours, Dr.

2. Was there any activity originating from your airfield that could have caused this sighting? Did anyone in the control tower see anything unusual and did anyone report a similar sighting to you on this day?
