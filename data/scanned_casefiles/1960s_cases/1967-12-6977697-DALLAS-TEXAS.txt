10. CONCLUSION
Probable Other: (CLOUDS)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Four

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted 4 objects in the northern sky that seemed to be altering their shapes. It then appeared as if there were clouds forming around the objects. The objects slowly moved south disbursed after apparently about 7 minutes.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
7 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

COMMENTS: On the date of the sighting there were a total of 855 aircraft operation at Love Field airport. No one at the tower saw anything unusual and no one reported anything unusual to them. The wind was a southerly direction at altitudes below 20,000 ft. There seems to be no reason why the objects could not have been clouds despite the fact that the observer did not see any other clouds in the sky.

Gentlemen:

On the 2nd of December at approximately 2:30 or 3:00, I was outside on the patio waiting for a barbeque fire to burn to the point where I could place some meat upon the grill. I was thinking and looking up at the sky and marveling at the clearness, the intense blue sky and that there was not one cloud in the sky as far as I could see. I saw 4 blurred objects in the sky that seemed to be altering their shapes but it appeared to be due north of me and over the house behind my residence. These blurred objects appeared rather suddenly and within a minute or so after I observed their presence, 4 clouds started to form around them. The wind was blowing from the north at that time and the density of the cloud around the object was intense and soon all that could be seen of the objects were the fact that the immediate area around, above and below the objects were the thick cloud or smoke. The wind was blowing the cloud and approximately 100 yards from the objects the cloud or streamers of cloud like material dissipated. I looked at these objects very slowly, for at least 4 or 5 minutes and they were moving very slowly, I would say in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 miles an hour and they seemed to hang in the sky. As they reached an overhead position, I saw these 4 distinct shapes, one was round with a scalloped type edge in the rear. I thought that whoever or whatever they might be was looking so I waved to them then I remembered my camera so I went into the house to fetch my camera and when I came out the clouds were over the house and I could not get a good picture so I went to the front of the house and aimed at the cloud formation to take a picture. When I realized the lens opening was not proper so when I took the camera down from my eye, adjust the lens and the speed of the shutter, I sited the clouds but the density or points of intense densities had disappeared. Within a matter of a minute or minute and half the clouds had disbursed. At that time and prior to the sighting of these clouds, there was no evidence of any other clouds in the whole sky as far as I could see.

On Monday the 4th of December, I was doing surgery with another physician and he stated "how did you like the weekend?" "Wasn't it beautiful out?" I said "Yes, and a funny thing happened". I described the cloud formation and he stated that he saw the cloud formation or this lonely cloud forming and then he saw it disappear and he was rather interested in this phenomenon.

On November 25, 1967 I was either fortunate or unfortunate in observing the positioning or placing of a platform above the Southeastern United States. Is this a coincidence or something to be considered when these 4 objects appear over my house approximately a week later? The day was clear, a wind was blowing, it was between 2:30 and 3:00 when this occurred, I was not

looking at the sun, visibility was unlimited, I was not tired, the lenses
of my glasses are and were clean. I imagined the altitude of these objects
were in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 thousand feet or less.

Sincerely yours,
