DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMMON OBJECT AND WHAT YOU SAW.

As stated, quite like a large beam ball (drifting somewhat on top of the waves - almost the same motion - continuity of direction) looked like the glow from a oil lantern or oil lamp & globe from a distance. No major differences that I can describe.

21. DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE, OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMALS OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY? [YES] [NO]. IF YES, DESCRIBE:
