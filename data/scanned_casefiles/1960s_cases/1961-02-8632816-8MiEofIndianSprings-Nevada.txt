10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Shiny, half-moon shaped object approx 5" in diameter. Appeared at 47.8 elevation, 144.70 azimuth. Witness did not watch object disappear. Moved slowly.

11. COMMENTS At 20,000' winds were at 340°; at 30,000' they were at 320°. These winds were moving in direction obj was reported to be moving. Obj sighted about 15 min after witness launched a balloon, and at this time balloon launched would have been in position reported for obj. Although witness is supposed to be familiar with balloons, it is very possible that he mistook this balloon for reported UFO. There was a cloud cover of 6-8/10 which would have contributed to misidentification.
