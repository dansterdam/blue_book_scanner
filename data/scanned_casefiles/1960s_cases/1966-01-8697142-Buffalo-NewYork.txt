Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Dear Sir:

On January 4, 1966 at 5:05 P.M., I saw a star-like object with long night time and flew over my front and flew over a few seconds to look more like a star. It was perhaps a few miles off to the south. I had parked for a second and with a look back, the object was still there. I may have also seen something on the G.F.C.

Very truly yours,
