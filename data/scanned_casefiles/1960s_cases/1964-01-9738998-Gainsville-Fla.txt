UFO                                                                January 26, 1964

Dear Sir:

On Sunday, January 26, 1964, I observed a yellow-white, orange-light (about 585 millimicron in wavelength) cross my meridian and then pass out of sight approximately ten minutes later (this was from 11:35-11:35 P.M.), at a point on a near-westerly path, and at, above, with the full moon, well above the city objects visible in the background sky.

The pointer and I waited, since there was only this one sightline light visible, some that it appeared to be a fit sighting at this time, that it might be some sort vehicle, i.e., weather satellite, rocket, or some type of heavenly body.

We would appreciate your assistance in clarifying the nature of this object, its purpose, and its orbital path if one exists. The observation is made was from (approximately) Latitude 29°N, Longitude 77°W or 70 miles west of Gainesville, Florida.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

[Signature area blacked out]

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEN

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (70 miles West of Jacksonville, Florida)

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Mr. _______, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Our records indicate no previous correspondence from Mr. _______.

2. The object reported had a southwesterly component ruling out all known satellites. The duration of ten minutes is not excessive for an aircraft at high altitude, particularly since he has indicated that it crossed the zenith. There are no high altitude air routes over Gainesville heading southwest. If the object were an aircraft it would not be on a regular schedule. However, this does not rule out aircraft as the most likely cause of his sighting.

Dear Mr. Weiss:

This is in response to your letter of January 26, 1964 in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object.

Since this object had a southwesterly component, it could not have been a known satellite. Although there are no high altitude air routes over Gainesville southwest, the duration of your sighting (ten minutes) is not necessarily for an aircraft at high altitude, particularly since you indicate the aircraft was not on a regular schedule. However, this does not rule out our aircraft as the most likely cause of your sighting.

Enclosed is a brochure concerning the Air Force Program on Unidentified Flying Objects which may be of interest to you.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
