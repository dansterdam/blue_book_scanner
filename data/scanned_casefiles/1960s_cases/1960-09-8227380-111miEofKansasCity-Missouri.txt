The undersigned was acting as a magnetic sensing of 223-mc. on surveillance of USAF CADF, September 1960. At approximately 20 miles east of Kansas City, Missouri, the following phenomenon was observed:

A brilliant "shooting star" phenomenon was observed horizontal from the horizon. The object appeared to be traveling at an extremely high speed (estimated 30,000 mph). The object underwent a "burn-out" on approximately vertical axis and directly over the observers.

The phenomenon then became a brilliantly lit vertical trajectory which descended to approximately 2,000 feet AGL when it "burned out". The vertical trajectory was observed for approximately 5 to 10 seconds. The entire sequence of events was observed for approximately 30 seconds. Analysis indicates that this phenomenon was the vertical trajectory of a high-speed object which underwent a sudden "burnout".
