The burn trace increased in intensity to level of the undersigned. The burn-out on approximately the level and directly over the nose of the aircraft. The most unusual aspects of the phenomenon were the vertical trajectory and the pure white intensity of the final burn-out, which approached that of a magnesium flare.
