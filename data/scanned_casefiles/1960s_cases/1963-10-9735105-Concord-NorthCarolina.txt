Here is the text I can read from the document:

U.S. Space
Washington, D.C.

There is a postmark dated SEP 9 1963 and a postage stamp visible. Some text appears to be redacted with black lines. The document appears to be an envelope or mailing document.

Note: Some words are partially illegible or obscured by black redaction marks. The text appears to be a handwritten letter describing some kind of unusual sky observation.

October 10, 1963

Dear [redacted]

This is in response to your recent letter in which you report that you and [redacted] saw a bright, moving star in the sky on the night of October 2nd.

What you and [redacted] saw was undoubtedly Echo satellite which passed over Concord and Charlotte at approximately 3:04 p.m. on the night of October 2nd. It was south of the city of Charlotte, about 75 degrees above the horizon southeast.

For your information, we are sending you both some brochures on the subject of unidentified aerial phenomena which we think may be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

The image appears to be a scanned document with very faint, mostly illegible text. The text is arranged in multiple columns and rows, but the resolution and contrast are so poor that I cannot confidently transcribe any specific words or characters. The document looks like a data table or form, but the details are not clear enough to read.
