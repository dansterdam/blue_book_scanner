October 10, 1963

Dear [redacted],

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported that you saw a bright, moving star in the sky on the night of October 2nd.

Your sighting was undoubtedly one of the satellites which are constantly visible in the sky over Concord and Charlotte about 75 miles to the south of the city as Charlotte.

Some for your information, we are not investigating this type of sighting further.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
