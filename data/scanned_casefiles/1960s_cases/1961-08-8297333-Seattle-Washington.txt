UFO

7 August 1961

Editor
The Post Intelligencer
Seattle, Washington

Dear Editor:

I am interested in so testify wrong who may have taken pictures of what UFO on 14 July 1961 near Tacoma. Because the pictures look so clear it was absolutely not a weather balloon, and I wanted to compare the pictures if someone else has some.

A student took some pictures of the UFO and believe you me it is so exciting. While shooting to learn about, because that old idea of the things being actually round have come to pass with the pictures we now have. We develop, too, and have made prints of our negatives. It would be most interesting to see other prints if they were taken.

Thank you,

lt.
