PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 17 Jan 1962
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 17/2325Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: None
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 mins
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The object was described as "like a light, changing brightness, 1/2th the size of a star". It was observed by one witness at Lynn, Mass. It was described as brillant and swaying from the northwest to overhead and northward slowly. The cause of this sighting is not available. Therefore, it is classed as insufficient information, but probably a balloon.
11. COMMENTS: This object was observed by only one witness and the description indicates that it was a familiar and normal object, such as a star, planet or balloon. It would have been rather dim and swaying in a typical balloon manner. The length of the sighting and the location do not contain sufficient information to establish the nature of this sighting conclusively.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
