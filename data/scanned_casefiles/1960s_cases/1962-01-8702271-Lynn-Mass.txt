2. LOCATION:
Lynn, Mass.

Local 1850
GMT 17/2350

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION:
■ Ground-Visual □ Ground-Radar
□ Air-Visual □ Air-Intercept Radar

5. PHOTOS:
□ Yes
■ No

6. SOURCE:
Civilian

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION:
1 hr. 2 min. 50 sec.

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS:
1

9. COURSE:
From Northwest to overhead

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
An object described as "like a light, changing brightness, with the sharpness of a star" was observed by one witness at Lynn, Mass. The object was a celestial and moving object.

11. COMMENTS:
The object observed by this witness was probably a wx balloon. This was a bright night due to the moon approaching full and it would have been rather easy to spot a balloon. The length of the brightness tends to substantiate this as the probable cause. Sufficient information to definitely state the cause of this sighting is not available. Therefore, it is classed as insufficient information, but probably a balloon.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
□ Was Balloon
■ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
■ Other: Insufficient Data
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
