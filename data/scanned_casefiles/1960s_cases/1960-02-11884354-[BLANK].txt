February 17, 1960

Office of the Commander
Air Force Research Division
United States and Development Command
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear General Holoman:

Thank you very much for your letter of 14 January 1960 in which you congratulate me on my appointment by Lieutenant General D. L. Putt as Director of the new Air Force Research Division. It is indeed an honor and a privilege to accept this position, and I shall do my utmost to justify the confidence placed in me.

The Air Force is now devoting more and more effort to scientific work, and I am delighted that this increased emphasis has been placed upon the scientific activities of the Geophysics Research Directorate and at other laboratories under my supervision. I have reviewed and studied in detail the program of the Office of Scientific Research, and I will assume directorship of its many activities with a deep sense of responsibility and confidence.

I wish to thank you and your staff for your advice and suggestions with respect to the policies and operations of the new Air Force Research Division. Since I continue to serve on the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and with the Air Materiel Command, I am confident that the transition will be accomplished without disruption of the work being done under my supervision. 

I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your new position of Director of the Air Force Research Division, and to express my appreciation and that of my staff for your continued interest and fine cooperation.

I am at present under the sponsorship of GRD and I supervise an administrative group related toward the study of stellar atmospheres. Through the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, I have identified the scientific activities for which I am responsible, and the work is being done under my direction. I should like to introduce to you Captain Joe Mettinger, the officer whom I have selected to assist me in this work, and to tell you that I have found him to be a diligent and capable person with whom to work, and I hope that this assignment will continue. I have every confidence that Dr. Wernher von Braun will provide the necessary assistance and cooperation to Captain Mettinger and to myself in the future.

TO GENERAL HOLOMAN
INFORMAL SUMMARY AND OUTLINE OF WHAT, IN MY OPINION, THE FUTURE
OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FROM HIGH ATMOSPHERIC ALTITUDES HOLDS.
I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO COMMENT WITH PLEASURE ON THE ENTHUSIASM AND SKILL OF CAPTAIN RITTINGER. I CONSIDER MYSELF EXTREMELY FORTUNATE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CAPTAIN RITTINGER.
I HAVE NO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROJECT, BUT DO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT AS IT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP IT WILL RECEIVE THE PERSONAL GOOD WISHES AND SUPPORT, I AM, HOWEVER, HAVE SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE AIR FORCE.
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE I HAVE BEEN CONSULTANT TO THE AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER REGARDING THE PROBLEM OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, PARTICULARLY THEIR ASTRONOMICAL ASPECTS.
I BEL THAT YOU WELL KNOW THE AIR FORCE HAS ATTEMPTED TO DO AS CREDIBLE A JOB AS POSSIBLE IN MAKING THE RESULTS OF THEIR STUDY PUBLICLY KNOWN. HOWEVER, ALL TOO OFTEN SUCH PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN UNFAVORABLE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE REFUSAL TO GIVE THE EVIDENCES OF THE REALITY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS TOO MUCH PUBLICITY, THE AIR FORCE IS COVERING UP THE EVIDENCE AND MISLEADING THE PUBLIC. I THINK THE EVIDENCES SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO ASK FOR MY SUGGESTIONS, I WOULD, THEREFORE, RECOMMEND THAT THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS OF THE UFO PROBLEM BE TRANSFERRED FROM ATIC TO A DIVISION MORE DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH SUCH MATTERS, PERHAPS TO THE ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH DIRECTORATE.

February 17, 1960

The subject of Unidentified Flying Objects more logically belongs in an intelligence center. My reasons for saying this are these: I think it is simply clear by now that there are highly reliable reports of objects in the earth's atmosphere that are quite incredible from the ordinary point of view. These reports are coming in from all over the world and include some very interesting examples of meteorological and atmospheric optics phenomena - such as light phenomena, reflections, etc. - that are worthy of study in themselves.

I do not think, however, that these objects should be kept quite separate from the air force's own scientific study of the upper atmosphere because, after all, the military is largely responsible for the public awareness of this phenomenon in the first place. And of course, the old arguments about value or the office of scientific research and public relations, etc., still remain.

It is not to be maintained that there is necessarily any parallel between the stones that fall from heaven and the many artificial satellites that now circumnavigate the world. However, it seems to me that the urgency for the nation to keep track of potentially hostile objects in the air, and the importance of properly assembling and evaluating the intelligence should be brought to the cognizance of scientific circles so that greater weight may be given to such considerations.

I do, therefore, recommend that consideration be given to the transfer of the scientific aspects of the Unidentified Flying Object problem to the Directorate of the Air Force Research Directorate or another appropriate scientific division or the Air Force.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:   TD-EE

SUBJECT:   Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

TO:   TD-G (Colonel Carlisle)

1. Reference our letter to AFOIN-P, subject: "Project Blue Book (Unidentified Flying Objects)," dated 20 April 1966, relating information concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects by Mr. Barney Abell on 16 February 1966.

2. Paragraph 6 of the referenced letter expressed that in the opinion of FTD, the UFO report should be a special project and the function absorbed by the Air Force in the conduct of its overall mission. Investigations and evaluations of UFO sightings should be the responsibility of the Air Force, and no special projects should be made to determine the cause for all sightings, but the primary objective would be directed toward determining the technical potential of the occurrences.

3. Our opinion that the UFO program should be discontinued as a special project is drawn from the following:

4. During the past 15 years the USAF has studied over 7300 cases of sightings of unidentified flying objects without discovering one shred of evidence indicating that UFO sightings are due to interplanetary space vehicles.

5. The accumulation of invaluable information for those incidents which may be significant other than as UFO sightings, are made to stop the Air Force elements through channels completely independent for those spelled out for UFO reports.

Based on experience gained from analyzing thousands of cases, it is believed that field organizations could determine the causes for approximately 75 percent of the reported unidentified potentials of them all.

Due to the time element and familiarity with the local environment, field organizations are better position to determine the cause of sightings for items such as aircraft, balloons launched locally, etc., than is FTD with the present method of operations.

Some of the sightings which take place during a year require more sophisticated treatment, than is often conducted under the capable of giving; however, in those cases it would be only to recognize the significance of the sighting and notify some agency with a specialized capability, e.g. the detection of a launch could be noted to an appropriate agency.

Text from the document:

Smithsonian Institute, in the instance of suspected meteoritic impacts, in other cases it should only be necessary for the air force to collect the scope films to RADC.

3. Before the USRO program could be discontinued as a special project, the public would have to be educated to accept this new philosophy. The following information would have to be brought to their attention:

a. The USRO's primary interest in UFO's is to determine their threat potential and/or military value.

b. Positive determination of the causes for all sightings is desirable, but the complete ban this would require severe curtailment on and extension of the USRO budget.

Probable causes for sightings based on limited information should be accepted:

d. The Air Force should not be required to disprove the claims of independent UFO organizations or investigators that sightings are due to interplanetary space vehicles.

e. If, contrary to our suggestion, the UFO program is continued as a special project:

a. The UFO project office be divorced from any connections with intelligence and security.
b. The project office be staffed with personnel who have the proper background to analyze sightings, conduct the investigations of significant incidents, and to conduct an effective public-relations program.

A public education program designed to allow discontinuance of the program as a special project after a specified time period, be a part of the mission of the project office.

TO: TD-E (Colonel Wynn)

1. On 6 April 1962 Lt. Colonel Friend, TD-E, visited DDI to participate in a briefing on the UFO program for Mr. Edward R. Trapnell, Assistant for Public Relations to the Secretary of the Air Force. Present were Dr. J.Allen Hynek, consultant to the Air Force on the UFO problem.

2. After his interest in the matter was whetted by a statement by Dr. Robert Calkins, Assistant Chief of Scientific Intelligence, stating that the recent publicity associated with unidentified flying objects, with a suggestion that some private sources might deliver findings of the program.

3. During the briefing Mr. Trapnell was informed of the origin of the program, when it was founded, the conclusions of the Air Force after 15 years of study, current problems, and recommendations concerning the UFO program.

4. The UFO program will be transferred to some agency such as NASA, Army, and Smithsonian and pursued under as entirely different title such as Atmospheric Physics.

The text from the document is as follows:

Transferred within the Air Force from technical intelligence to a strictly restricted Air Force complex and concentrated to some private organization, such as Brookings. 

Such an agreement or decision which will make positive statements regarding the program and the Air Force's handling of it in the past and make recommendations regarding its future. Unless the program is completely or handle it as outlined in A or B above.

C. A decision as to whether Dr. Calkins, Mr. Trappell plans to visit PTD with Dr. Calkins for an informal discussion prior to a decision regarding the PTD program. No date has been established for this visit as of this date. Approval has been obtained in order to allow transfer of the complete office at a moment's notice.

To transfer this program to another agency because none of them want to absorb it in the normal course of its operations. The final decision will be made on the basis of the contract either to transfer the complete program to another agency or to absorb it in the normal course of the Air Force's scientific structure.

Text extracted from the document:

I recently sat beside Dr. Robert Calkins, president of Brookings, at dinner. Among the items we discussed was the UFO business. He feels that the Air Force should get somebody to take an independent look at this thing, probably some kind of a citizen committee which could review the matter and issue a report in such a way as to get the Air Force off the spot it seems to think we are on. 

I have agreed to sit down with him some time and discuss the possibilities. He says Brookings would be willing to help in whatever way it can. In the meantime, I would like to have your views on what might be done constructively in this connection.

Project Blue Book (Unidentified Flying Objects)
20 APR 1962
HQ USAF
ATCIN-4 DC 
On 6 April 1962 ATIC participated in a briefing on the USAF unidentified flying objects program which was given to Dr. Robertson's committee for Public Relations to the Secretary of the Air Force. This briefing was requested by the Department of Public Relations and concerned recent investigations between ATIC and the Robertson Committee. During the briefing Mr. Trapnell was informed of the history of the program, the Air Force's role in current investigations, and the major problems involved. This briefing was done at the request of the Robertson Committee. It was considered that any evidence which would change the conclusion of the Robertson Committee should be presented.
a. ATIC pointed out that this is a major step toward accepting many associations with any unsolved case as substantiated. This was out of place with the Air Force, and indicated that he intends to take the investigations of the Air Force with a view to the public.
b. A transfer of the UFO project to another agency such as NASA, NSP or Smithsonian Institutions and have conducted as a program to study the atmospheric physics.
c. Discontinuance of project from any association with intelligence and hire a contractor to conduct the program under Air Force monitoring.
d. Contract a private organization to study the material which has been accumulated to date and recommend a course of action. This recommendation could be comparable if the Air Force programme was adequate and the present position was unacceptable.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

"1. Mr. Deyell to review UFO prior to a final decision as to what course of action should be taken on UFO cases. Review all reports with a view to selecting the most significant for detailed analysis and recommendation to the scientific advisory panel.

2. The plan as outlined in Attachment 3, AFCIN 270-17, is January 1960 to continue the procedure to screen other government agency for the following reasons:

a. The communication of all reports with handling the communication would be facilitated if a single directive agency were established.

b. Transfer of the program to some agency such as NASA would only serve to limit the investigations to interplanetary space vehicles.

c. Certain programs conducted would be many times more expensive than the present method of operating and would give no better results than the present method unless a much larger staff were required regarding operations.

d. Allen Hynek is the consultant regarding scientific considerations made by Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

The Air Force contractor would serve principally as an analyzing agency, and the analysis would still find it necessary to investigate the majority of the reports it received.

e. It would be necessary to provide a contractor with specialized research in certain cases, special programs and/or operations; and other specialized information to support their work.

f. Air Force personnel would be required to monitor the contract and provide 'support' to the contractor.

In the FTD opinion that the UFO program should be discontinued as a special Air Force activity, Closing the Project Blue Book would transfer this responsibility to the agency that is given this assignment."
