The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten response to a questionnaire. The text of the handwritten response is as follows:

"The thing that struck me about the object was its slowness. I have observed many planes flying in the air and have never seen an object like this. This object did not have any lights that I could see. Usually, plane lights blink and continue to glow."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a report of a UFO sighting.

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a typed document discussing a UFO sighting report.

Here is the text from the document:

See Dr. Hynek's rpt, Feb., 1962. weather.

Called Miss ___ regarding her sighting of 21 June 1967 at Las Vegas. Report was shoped and written. The object was over one and there were many contradictions. The girl turns out to be a freshman in college and not very sure of physical things. She is a journeyman radar and I would say all-in-all that the original analysis is probably correct. Instead of possible aircraft, I would say probably somewhat eccentric. The witness indicated a definite location of the object that has not been written very much to begin with.  

The diagram indicates that the object disappeared in the telephone conversation and it indicated that she never had to lift her head very much and that the object always appeared low in the sky. This is an unreliable and untrained witness and there certainly is no compelling reason to think she saw anything other than a aircraft.

There is a photograph or sketch present in the image. It appears to be a compass or compass-like diagram, as well as a sketch showing the motion of an object or objects.

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

A slow steady upward flight
