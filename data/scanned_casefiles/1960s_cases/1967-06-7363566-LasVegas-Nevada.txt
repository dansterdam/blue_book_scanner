34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 JULY 1962

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The thing that struck me odd about the object was its slowness. I have observed many planes flying in the air and I have never seen one fly as slow and as high as this object did. I have never seen a flying object with just one red light either. Usually, plane lights blink on and off. This light was just a continuous glow.

Here is the text from the document:

See Dr. Hyneck Jan, Feb, Mar. Weather.
UFO Journal

Called Miss [redacted] regarding her sighting of 21 June 1967 at Las Vegas. Report was taped and witness was a poor one and there were many contradictions. The girl turns out to be a freshman in college and not very sure of physical things. She is a journalism major and I would say all-in-all that the original analysis is probably correct. Indeed of possible aircraft, I would say probably aircraft. The witness had little recollection of what had been written in her report thus indicating that the original sighting did not impress her very much to begin with. The diagram indicates that the object disappeared in the zenith yet in the telephone conversation she indicated that she never had to tilt her head very much and that the object always appeared low in the sky. This is an unreliable and untrained witness and there certainly is no compelling reason to think she saw anything other than aircraft.
