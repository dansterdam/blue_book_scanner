There was no phenomena of the actual scan itself appeared in human. The material constructed and finally on its reverse course back to stand and watch. It was 20°C; 2 minutes, easterly and westerly direction moving at a constant rate of speed about 4.5 miles. The "magnetics" plate, according to the magnetic materials. Bend and still do it was similar. There was no phenomena of the normal scan itself appeared of a person. Eastward and finally on its reverse course back to screen saver. It was 20°C; 2 minutes, easterly and westerly direction moving at a constant rate of speed about 4.5 miles. Of the UFO was near the reported, 5000' est. all this speed was about 4 seconds for the initial positioning, 5-6 seconds for the material of the UFO.

Text from the document:

The ground observed at 6:15 consists of a circular array of lighted objects or UFOs which appeared to be grounded in a level cleared area of about 200 sq. yards. The UFOs appeared in a circular array about 30 ft. diameter. They appeared as a bright of light (UFO) above the horizon. This minimum 4fs' x approx 10' diameter lights observed over as low as 20E on the southern sky on the east "leg" to 45E for those still remaining, essentially at this angle until full daylight.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

My photo in plain view does not indicate the entire phenomenon. The object seemed to get on the ground. Her description of the total flight differs somewhat from mine. Most of what she describes I did see but am not certain of some points. I do not believe the usual explanation of a steady light observed.
2. Color of light, similar to polariz.
3. Very sharp, tight, about 1/4 of the size of a full moon.
4. Following the path of the object with the binoculars I lost it momentarily but reloced it near the same point after a very short interval. My observation confirmed hers for the most part.
That is all I can add now. If you have any other questions please call me collect.

DEAR DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, USAF

DEAR SIR:

REGARDING MY TELEPHONED REPORT TO YOUR OFFICE ON 6 FEB 1967 - 2 MINUTES PAST 0800. THIS MIGHT MEAN MIDNIGHT OF A POSSIBLE UFO.

MY CO-OBSERVER (WIFE) AND CHECKING CAREFULLY TODAY WITH A BRIEF RECORD BACK CHECKED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE TIME OF OBSERVATION TO MINE TO REPORT A TOTAL TIME OF OBSERVATION 

ABOUT 10 MINUTES OCCURRING ON THE NIGHT OF 6 FEB 1967. IT SEEMED MUCH LONGER - UP TO 15 SECONDS. IT RANGED IN BRIGHTNESS FROM VERY BRIGHT TO A DIM REDDISH YELLOW LIGHT.

ITS FLIGHT PATH WAS APPROXIMATELY 150 TO 200 FEET ACROSS THE HOUSE TO GO OUT OF SIGHT ON THE LIGHT BECAUSE OF PROBABLE DISTANCE.

The image does not contain any photographs or images, it appears to be a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

cataloged for 15 minutes. I still perceive the clock clearly until coming back into the house. Immediately preceding this dark unusual effect, the clock appeared to go back approximately 10 to 15 seconds. Animal on target lighting seemed to go out, but I turned it up my binoculars & holding I reed 11.50 pm?. From this and what occurred exactly coincided with 10 to 15 seconds delay on clock, it appears that something odd occurred on target. Needless to repeat , but I arrived at 10:57 and. I have read all the material on target in a normal sequence including detailed photographing any cue in the sky at night. Although I do not claim to be a professional astronomer, I have observed carefully many times and have observed "OFO's" last night appeared to me as a satellite like object, but slowly oscillated at various times and have a observed carefully their relative speeds, and the times and their movements, and I concluded that it was not a satellite. could not be visual confusion, as it was clear night with good observation conditions.

- page 12 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image consists of handwritten text on what appears to be an official document or report.

Output of the text in the document:

was much lower to earth than a satellite and more nearly estimated 5000 feet altitude. we are at 2000 feet above sea level and it would appear as the night bright white light from the east the size of a small star, gradually becoming brighter until it nearly disappeared. sighting duration approx. (1945 1957) usually a short duration except on one occasion of about 15 minutes. the light appeared to be straight away as the configuration of the path was nearly straight except for a slight swing off course demostrating a straight line illumination on a light source descending at an angle about 2 or 3 degrees left or right from the straight path. this report no made or found in this sighting. velocity of satellite in most unlikely and the brightness or glow of object quite distinct.
