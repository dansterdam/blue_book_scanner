a jet and close enough to earth
to visual.

The light observed was of uniform
intensity, not pulsating, not color
changing. Comparing it to a known
heavenly body I would suggest Polaris
the pole star, as observed from our
latitude 44°38' N. The magnitude
of Polaris and the UFO light being
very similar and the color being
similar. There was no phenomena of
the usual star twinkie" apparent. The
light was steady except as it receded
eastward and finally on its reverse
course back northerly and easterly, appr
20° E. mag. Of interest is the note that
my wife said the light had an
elliptical shape at times. This I
cannot verify as it appeared to me
much as Polaris does, essentially round.

Of the UFO was near the reported
5000' est. alt. then its speed was
fantastic, perhaps (800 m.p.h. allowing
about 5-6 seconds) for the initial
horizontal pass of 4 miles estimated.
On the apparent altitude was on th
order of most satellites, thus the

for any of the + satellite I have
observed. This place the entire course
sort of rules out satellites with me.
Significant - horizontal high speed
level "flight" for an estimated distance
of 4 to 5 miles north to south, then a
90° abrupt left turn, an easterly
climbing flight for an estimated 2 to 2
miles, followed by another 90° left
turn to a north heading paralleling
the initial course and then fading two
north easterly seems unusual for a
satellite; or a jet fighter, no haze, or a
weather balloon, no local ground wind
(I do not know the winds slept in the
vicinity of Lincoln County as of last
night) but - have never known them
to reverse in less than 5 minutes)
Several things on my phone report to
you may not be clear then.
1. I have no positive way to estimate
difference in altitude between lets say an
aircraft light of a certain intensity and
a reflection light of a satellite at the
apparent same intensity but of much
greater altitude and distance so my
estimated alt. of 5000 may be way off
which would throw out my estimate

for comparison though I could say
if the UFO covered an arc of sky
in level flight north to south of 30°
approx.

The angle of light (UFO) above the
horizon was maximum 45° approx. It
appeared even as low as 30° on the
tilted course swooping or climbing up
on the east leg to approx 45° and
staying essentially at this angle until
fade out on reverse course.

Senior Director of Operations, USAF
Clair Air Force Base,
Albany, Oregon.

Dear Sir:

Regarding my telephoned report to your station 924-5511 ext.741-2 made last night near midnight of a sighting of a possible UFO.

After further discussion with my co-observer (wife) and checking carefully today with a sweep second-hard clock and retracing the "flight" path we real I inadvertently added her time of observation to mine to report a total time of observation of est. 7 minutes. The more likely total time of actual in sight observation by me was 10 to 15 seconds. It seemed much longer without a time piece.

I had left my wife and son(3) to run 100 feet to the house to get my 70x50 binoculars and run the 150 feet back out. I did not turn on the light because of probable

established for 15 minutes. I did not
see the clock clearly, until coming
back into the house after terminate
of observation. In the dark as I
picked up my binoculars I believe I
read 1155 PM. From this and later
clock check I deduce 4 to 5 minute
elapsed time with 10 to 15 seconds
actual on target sighting. Needless to
repeat but I arrived too late with my
binoculars.

Tonight I am loaded with telescopic
lens on a Konica single lens reflex
task film although I realize the very
difficult task of photographing
anything in the sky at night.

On further consideration I wish to a
that I have seen satellites at various
times and have observed carefully their
relative speed, considering their distant
or range away. At first glance, the
observed "UFO" last night appeared to
me as a satellite. Upon observation we
a few seconds or less I realized this
could not be such an object because
of the flight, abrupt 90° left turn.
Further observation led me to believe

Here is the text from the document:

was much lower to earth than a satellite and more nearly estimated 5000 feet altitude. (we are at 200° above sea level) If it was a jet fighter then it would appear as the light bluish white light from the after end of the tail pipe. However, I do not recall ever (1945-1967) visually observing this condition except on straight-away flight of a jet fighter. From this I have to rule out a jet fighter as the configuration of the flight path, especially the first observed horizontally flfy, would not like demonstrate clearly a stern view illumination or light. Secondly, all jet fighters I have observed (many when close enough to visually observe tail flame or afterburne were accompanied by substantial sound and often sonic boom. We report NO noise or sound in this sighting.

Turning 90° left tight turns at the velocity of satellites is most unlikely and the lightness or abrupt change in direction precludes all known jet fighters. it the slight 115
