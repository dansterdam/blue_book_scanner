SIGHTING 20 Sep 67
Mr. [redacted] of Tipp City called and wanted to know if we had any UFO reports from
last night. His boy and a neighbor, 17 years old, saw a UFO land on the highway
G-7G-5 S/D "TIPP-15 -
last night. They had called the Miami County Sheriff. "The object was tear drop with
three white light and a tail with one red light. In the air the object looked about
the size of a thumb. When it was on the ground on Rt 25-A it covered the road. There
was no other traffic on the road. Object was on the road for about one minute. Turned
the cycle around and by the time turned it around the object was gone. About 1/4 mile
from object. It looked like it was on the ground but the light looked real high and
then it looked like it was coming toward them. They first saw the object in the air.
It came over us (the witnesses) and stood and then looked like it zig-zagged then went in
the field. It was in the middle of the road glowing. About 1/2 mile from the object.
First saw the object at 2315 about ten minutes later it landed. It did take off.
There was nothing on the road after it left. There were telephone lines in the area.
The UFO was lower than the lines. When the witnesses turned around to go back and
see the object it was gone. They couldn't see it disappear because they thought
their motorcycles were going to wreck when they turned around. They turned around
at the intersection of 571 and 25A. The cornfield was on the right. They were on
25A south towards Vandalia. The object hooped and went on. Couldn't estimate the
sheight and there was no noise. When the object came towards the witnesses it was
fast. Went after object and almost turned over on cycle. Witnesses were:
[names redacted], Tipp City, phone [redacted]
[names redacted], Tipp City, phone [redacted]

Since the information that the witnesses was confusing and the witness Henshall
continued to explain his observation at a fast pace that couldn't always be readily
understood Lt Mara[redacted] informed them that we'll either contact them this afternoon, 21 Sep
or sometime tomorrow since both witnesses said they would be at the [redacted] number.

Summary of the Tipps City Sighting

On 20 Sept. 1967 and had gone to visit a friend who lived on Floral Drive. The friend was not home, but as they started to leave they saw what they thought to be a UFO in the west-southwest west. The time was about 11:15 pm EDT. The boys saw four lights, a red light, behind which were three white lights, slightly to one side. The object came from the WSW, made a right turn and started south. When it passed over the boys it appeared to hover for about 20 sec. It then continued south and the boys lost sight of it in a low cloud.

When the boys first saw the object they stopped, ed their motorcycle and watched. Then one boy got off the cycle, took a chrome crash helmet and tried to flash light at the object. When the object disappeared into the clouds, the boys got on their cycle and decided to see if they could catch it.

[Redacted names] of Troy, Ohio heard the boys outside shouting that there was a UFO in the sky. Mrs. turned on the porch light. Mr. walked outside, but turned off the porch light as he stepped out the door. He walked down 20 feet down his side walk. He saw one boy get off the cycle and try to shine light in the sky with his helmet. Mr. looked all around but could not see anything unusual. After a while the boys got on their cycle and drove away quite rapidly. As the cycle turned south on route 25a, Mr. saw a slowly moving plane in the west heading north. As the boys drove south, they again saw a light zig-zagging toward the south. They thought that the object landed in a field about one half mile from the intersection of 571 and 2A on 25A. As they were driving, looking in the field, Mike Johnson saw something just above the road between one half and one quarter mi. from them. They slowed down and as the lights seemed to brighten, they became afraid. turned in the cycle around, in the process upset it. They remounted and started north. looked back and saw the object as five lights illuminating a cornfield behind them. The lights appeared directly over the road and in a horizontal line; the two end lights being red and the three center lights were white. The boys race the cycle to the junction of 571 and made a right turn and stopped at a service station. They then looked at the sky but could see nothing.

They wanted someone to go back to the sight with them but no one would and the boys were to frightened to go themselves. The total time of the sighting was about 10-14 mins. rather reported the sighting to the Miami County Sheriff's Office that night and to The Aerial Phenomena Branch at Wright Patterson the next day.

SUMMARY CONT.

We called the Miami County Sheriff and he gave us a copy of the report as he received it.

We contacted the control tower at Vandalia. Mr. Shumaker, a controller, looked in the log, and found no comments about any thing unusual. Neither were there any UFO reports called in to the tower on that night. He also found that there were shore aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. At approx. 1119 pm a DC-9 make its approach from the north. At 1126pm a Twin Otter left Vandalia heading NW then N. At 1129 toll30pm an American 727 came.

From the south and made its approach east of Tipp City. The two inbound craft would have been at about 1200 ft altitude and probably had their landing light en. The Twin Otter would have been between 1200 and 300 ft, and probably did not have landing lights on. Mr. Ray, the controller on duty at the time of the sighting, was telephoned and he said that none of the aircraft reported any thing unusual and that he had not seen any thing unusual.

There was no evidence that any landing occurred, either in the field or on the road. Geiger counter readings showed no increase in radiation in this area as compared with other areas ( office, etc.)

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

2200hrs. 21 Sept. 1967

Called Mr. Ray the controller*out by at the time of the sighting.
He said that no pilots had reported any thing unusual and that
he had seen nothing unusual himself.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Observation and landing, 20 Sep 67, Tipp City, Ohio

Lt Marano spoke with the Sheriff of Miami County. He asked the Sheriff whether they had UFO sighting for last night the 20th of September. He said that the only one they had was from Hensball where two boys had seen a flying saucer. A deputy went down to the area and couldn't find anything. Deputy Adkens had taken the report. The Sheriff said he would send Lt Marano a copy of their report. They reported going North on 25-A when the flying saucer hovered over them until they went to the intersection of route 571 and 25-A. The object was large rectangular when it came down as a falling leaf. White glaring light blinded them.

Lt Marano spoke with Mr. Shumaker of the Dayton Tower. He had aircraft at 1118 or 1119 pm 20 Sep a DC-9 approach did come slightly East of Tipp City. DC-9 came from the North making its approach slightly East of Tipp City.

An American 727 came from the south and made its approach slightly East of Tipp City at approximately 1129-1130 pm. A Twin Otter DH06 left Vandalia at 1126 pm going NW then North. Probably would have been between 1200 and 3000 ft alt, slightly west of Tipp City. The other planes would have been at about 1200 ft altitude. They all had red beacons rotating, one on top and one on bottom. The outbound planes would have had condenser chargers on wing tips. The approaching planes would probably have had their landing lights already on or would have turned them on as approaching Tipp City. The Twin Otter would not have had his landing light normally on, however, if there were other aircraft in the area he may have flashed his lights. None of these aircraft reporting missing sighting anything unusual. If they would have it would have been in the report log.

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 20 September 1967 near Tipp City, Ohio.

2. During the time of your sighting there were three airplanes that passed at low level, directly over the area in which you observed the UFO. Aircraft crew members reported seeing nothing unusual and no one at the control tower at Vandalia observed anything unusual.

3. 1st Lt Marley and 2nd Lt Marano interviewed one person who was outside at the time of your observation. This person proceeded to observe the sky at the same time and were shouting that there was an UFO in the sky. The observer saw nothing out of the ordinary; he did see an airplane in the area.

4. The lighting arrangement which you and [redacted] described is similar to that of a conventional aircraft.

5. For the reasons stated above, we feel that you observed aircraft in their landing and take-off patterns. We are filing your report with the evaluation "Probable Aircraft."
