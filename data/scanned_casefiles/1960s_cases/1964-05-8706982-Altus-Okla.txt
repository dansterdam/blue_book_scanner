10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Eight hovering over missile site. Guard called additional witness and observed to be fading in distance. White obj, round, no sound, initial observation to S at 45° elev. Passed over Site at 80° elev. Initial phase of observation light hovered over S for 8-10 mins. Light then drifted upward where it then appeared to have intensity of N Star. Faded in 2-4 mins. Motion against wind. Not observed from additional sites in area.

11. COMMENTS
UNIDENTIFIED. Motion against wind. Hovering not consistent with a/c evaluation unless Helo. Light could be attributed to Helo with a landing light or other light a/c similar to those used on photo missions, however rising and disappearance inconsistent with observable characteristics of this type of object. Sighting evaluated as ECHO II in Sextant and not reported.

MISSILE SITE 7, ALTUS AFB, OKLAHOMA

UFO Report from SAC. Received at 1135Z at SAC Command Post. At 1030Z Missile Site 6, Altus, Oklahoma reported a large bright light (size of a/c) overhead, below 10,000' directly over silo. Light was bright enough to light silo cap. Reported to people in silo, and crew silo commander sent a maintenance man up, who saw light and verified it being there. By the time he got there it had moved to an extremely high altitude. Moved vertically in NW direction. Weather high thin, scattered.

Spoke with Lt/Col Hollis. Site has guards all night, no Military personnel. No Silo Crew Commander. Was told that it was Missile Site #7. Lt Stevenson, OIC, witness A3C Davis. AIC Somers spoke with these witnesses. Observation 1030Z-1040Z, like large aircraft rising, looked like bright star. South of Silo Door, 2x as bright as star. Flight from E to North gaining altitude from 30 deg - 45 deg.

Missile Site 7, Altus AFB, Oklahoma, Sunrise 0528 am at 35 degrees N beginning of twilight 0341 am. Time of sighting 1030Z = 0430am.

Brightness in sky, size of large a/c under 10,000 ft. Alt was estimated by high thin clouds. No features, light only. Rose straight up at fast rate. Duration 10+. Motion was to Northwest. AIC Somers saw for 15 minutes at 45 deg elevation. There was no change in size nor change in color. It faded into the distance disappearing. There were no features other than light. A3C Davis first saw obj (light) had a magnitude of 2X N Star. There was a change in brightness which was associated with motion. He was fading northeast.

Lt Stevenson OIC, Missile SOD ext 451.

Here is the text from the document:

(4) A3C Davis, after first seeing the object, watched it hover over the south fence for 8-10 minutes, then the light drifted upward to where it appeared to be twice the size and intensity of the North Star. Airman Davis then went over to the LOC Entry and phoned the LOC. A1C Sumera was sent topside immediately and observed the object still hovering over the site. The light then wobbled slightly and started to move in a northwest direction very rapidly, finally disappearing.

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201
18 November 1964

Major Hector Quintanilla
Foreign Technology Division
Box 9494
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing the equatorial crossing sheet for Echo I and Echo II for the year 1964, to the present. I shall send you copies of the new sheets as they come along, as I have a good reason now to believe they will.

With reference to the Altus, Oklahoma sightings, 21 May 1964, that definitely has proved to be Echo II, as reference to the enclosed sheets will show. I believe the identification is positive.

The case of the Northwestern student from Elmhurst, Illinois is in abeyance. The student is no longer here but is now resident in the Virgin Islands. Since this sighting was very likely an aircraft, I don't think we need to pursue this one any further. The getting, in any case, contained very little information, and it does not seem profitable to try to get more out of this chap at the present time. Since we have gone this far, however, if you feel it worthwhile, my gang and I here can send a letter off to him to see what light bring forth. But I don't think it's much worthwhile.

What are your plans on coming to visit us? I would suggest the week of December 7 as the one following I am scheduled to be in Austin, Texas for a few days, and during the first week in December, I shall be in New Mexico.

With respect to the Altus case, would it not be a good idea to drop a note to Mr. Davis and Somers to let them know that they had seen Echo II? Good inter-Air Force relations.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
