Baker, Oregon, 9 December 1964

During the early morning hours of 5 December, a UFO was spotted by at least five residents of Baker, Oregon, including State Policeman William Howe. The object, a bright light, was seen for about 10 minutes. Howe and several others got a close look at the UFO, which appeared to be hovering about 200 feet off the ground, and they witnessed a flickering yellowish light on the rear of the object as it moved slowly from northwest to southeast, according to the observers.
