The text in the document reads as follows:

(1) Captain Donald D. Dettloff, AD 3033215, Assistant Base Operations Officer, 4602d Air Defense Wing, Colorado Springs, Colorado.

(2) The following agencies were contacted in an attempt to obtain additional reports on the sightings: 
 
(a) Denver ARTC. This agency checked their radar and flight logs for the period 0050Z to 0115Z.

(b) Colorado State Patrol.

(c) Local Law Enforcement Agencies in Colorado Springs, Broadmoor, Garden of the Gods, Garden of the Gods Park, Cheyenne Mountain Park, Pueblo, Canon City, and Salida.

(3) A complete survey was made in turn contacting all fire towers and ranger stations in the area.

(4) FAA contacted towers at Peterson Field and Pueblo Municipal, Pueblo.

(5) The lodge manager on top of Pikes Peak and the toll gate operators for the road leading to the top of the peak.

(6) In addition to the above checks the North American Air Defense Command Operations and Facility Center was contacted. They indicated there was no unusual activity at that time that could have caused the sightings.

(7) The sightings correlated with red "X"s to indicate direction and distance, but produced little additional information.

(8) Preliminary analysis of the sightings:
 
(a) The film taken from all five witnesses leaves little doubt that the objects were present. However, the film may prove inconclusive as to the true nature of the objects.
 
(b) The objects did not demonstrate any flight patterns or maneuvers that are not possibleto modern aircraft.
 
(c) No one else had seen these objects before, although several individuals felt they had seen similar objects on previous occasions. The other witnesses, however, could not confirm these earlier sightings.

The text in the document reads as follows:

(b) The sightings could have been caused by particular meteorological conditions, or by the reflections of lights from the ground or hills etc. The high winds and thunderstorms in the area could also have been factors.

(c) The objects when sighted were almost in line with the setting sun. This suggested to the observer that the "sightings" took place at the time of the setting, with many thunderstorms in the area.

1. The objects did not appear to approach the observers. This violated the perspective and no solid objects were seen.

2. Existence of physical evidence: (a) No indications were found which could be interpreted as physical evidence in the environment where the sightings took place. The trees, bushes etc. were not damaged or disturbed in any way, and no residue or markings were found on the ground.

3. The attended roll of film is undeveloped and should be secured for further processing.

SUBJ: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

1. Reference your letter, subject as above, dated 25 Aug 64.

2. The sightings described have been analyzed and it is believed that the objects observed were apparently caused by well-known physical phenomena. The observers discussed at great length with each of the witnesses their observations and interpreted what they saw as follows:
a. The matter of the objects not apparently changing in size and position as observed would indicate that there were no great changes in their actual position. The observers were in agreement on this, and discussed this at length.
b. The apparent slow movement toward them and the "blinking" of the lights as they observed would indicate that these were distant objects, perhaps high-altitude aircraft, balloons, or satellites, which is supported by the fact that the observers did not get an impression that these were extremely close or large objects.
c. The fact that the objects did not get any larger nor could they provide any indication by other means that the objects were in fact closer than they appeared, leads to the conclusion that the sighting was of distant objects.

4. The two objects which disappeared behind Pikes Peak were considered the most significant and were definitely darker in color and made definite turning movements.

Dear Sir:

This letter is in reply to the UFO report which you submitted some time ago. The film you submitted was viewed and being analyzed. I regret that the progress has been slow. They were unable to identify any objects for an explanation.

The film consisted mainly of background and family activities, the film mentioning occurred of circular objects with sun-like illuminating bright appearance. These objects would appear stationary, then ascend rapidly and disappear. These scenes were confined to certain areas and on the film were short in duration.

The film was of poor quality, underexposed and difficult to analyze. However, the objects mentioned do not conform to any normal aircraft or phenomena known to us at this time. The film does not show any details that could be positively identified. While the unexplained objects displayed movement and appearance characteristics, the quality of the film precludes any definite conclusions.

I regret that we are unable to provide you with a more definitive report. However, I trust this general information is of some assistance. If you have any questions or additional information, please feel free to contact us.

Sincerely,

Signed

OFFICIAL FILE COPY
UFO SIGHTING, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, 19 AUG 64
VFO 31428/64 (Mrs Hust)
CASE 0 - 5390
This office is in receipt of a UFO report from the Household
Finance Corporation, Colorado Springs, Colorado.
The following information is provided in order that a possible
investigation can be made:
Photo analysis and photo processing personnel visited the
subject site and several negatives were exposed. They were
to all appearances normal and could not be identified as to
the object seen. The film was processed and returned
to the witness.
The photo analysis on the film failed to reveal any photographic
anomalies. The film consisted of neighborhood scenes and the
family residence. The film consisted of slides taken with and
internal 35mm camera. Several frames showed silhouetted objects
which apparently were persons or vehicles passing in front of the
camera. No unusual lighting effects or objects were noted in
these frames. An individual frame by frame analysis did not
reveal any evidence that an image outside the normal neighborhood
scene was recorded on the film.
While the transmission lines are in sharp focus, indicating the
camera was properly focused, the object observed at the time of
the sighting is not shown. This suggests that the object may
have been beyond the field of view and/or the distance at which
the camera focused.
This statement is based on the reported distance from the observer
to the object as 75-100 yards, and on the fact that the size of the
object as reported would normally exceed the size of the image
expected on the film at that range.
Therefore, the image causing the object is probably "out of
focus".

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, dated August 30, 1964, regarding an unidentified flying object sighting in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT 
DATE OF REPORT: 30 August 1964
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
LOCATION: COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
DATE: 30 August 1964
PHOTOGRAPHY: - 3 EXPOSURES PROVIDED BY USAF
PURPOSE: This report analyzes work under number 64-103 submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, Project Blue Book, relating to the reported sighting of an unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS: According to the Technical Division photo analysis and photo processing personnel, they were unable to define any objects or damage which could be attributed to the film. The film was examined and analyzed by experts, and the findings indicate that the film shows only normal sky conditions. There appears to be no evidence that the film contained any unusual or unidentified objects.
CONCLUSIONS: The film examined shows only normal sky conditions and family photographing. After the family photographed, they reported seeing an unidentified object. These items appear to be near the point where the photography was taken. However, the photographic evidence does not substantiate the existence of any unidentified flying object in the film. Therefore, the image causing the object is probably attributable to other known causes.

The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing descriptive text about the objects observed.

Text output:

Description of course of objects:
(1) What first called the attention of observers to the objects were persons out four adults and one minor, were sitting under the starlight. The objects were seen to the east and northeast from their location in an open field 7-10 miles northeast of Pikes Peak. The objects were first noticed just north of Pikes Peak. The observers watched the objects for an undetermined interval of time.

(2) Angle or elevation and azimuth of objects: They were first observed at an angle of 20-25 degrees above the horizon and bearing 060-070 degrees from the observers' location. The objects appeared to be traveling quite rapidly toward the southwest. The objects reportedly covered the distance between one point and another in a very short time, estimated to be 5-10 seconds. The objects disappeared from view at about an angle of 10 degrees above the horizon and bearing 240-250 degrees.

(3) Angle or elevation and azimuth of objects upon disappearance: The objects disappeared from view an angle of about 10 degrees above the horizon and bearing 240-250 degrees.

(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers of objects: The objects appeared to travel quite rapidly toward the southwest. While the objects maintained a generally straight course, they did exhibit some slight changes in elevation, rising and dipping slightly. This may have been due to atmospheric effects. There was no abrupt change in course or speed observed, except for the two which descended from the main group. These two objects descended quite rapidly and disappeared from view.

(5) How did the objects disappear? The main group disappeared rather gradually, becoming more and more indistinct until they were no longer visible.

(6) How long were the objects visible? Approximately five minutes.

(7) Manner of observation:
(1) All sightings were ground visual.
(2) There were no optical aids used.
(3) There were no distractions.
