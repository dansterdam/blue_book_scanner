Observer was star watching when she saw a bright light descending toward NE ARA. It was only a light and she never saw a red or green light like airplanes have. All of a sudden the bright white light disappeared. The witness has seen this before but this is the first time she has reported it to the AF.

A landing aircraft with bright landing lights could have accounted for the sighting.
