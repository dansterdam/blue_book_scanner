10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING               11. COMMENTS
Round, bright light, becoming more orange and   Object was possibly planet Mercury which
less luminous as it descends, about the size of was just above the western horizon; how-
an automobile headlight. Object disappeared be- ever, the direction of the object which
low the horizon.                               was observed was not given, precluding a
                                               valid conclusion, as to the exact object.
                                               There is sufficient information to indicate
                                               that the object was an astronomical body
                                               and the case is carried as such.

SUBJECT (Descriptive title, use individual reports for separate subjects): UFO Sighting

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative text on AF Form 112a times used, number of pages):

From all the information available it would seem the sighting is a balloon or some object with a highly reflective surface. Its appearance at approximately the same time in all of the observations supports the thesis that it is some device used by an organization or base in the area. Further, since there have been no sightings after dark, a source of light is necessary for observation. This, plus its slow rate of descent, lends support to the contention that the object is a balloon or a similar object.

1960

A wave of sightings in New Mexico and near El Paso, Texas, caused headlines in many newspapers in last September. The most widely publicized of the sightings occurred on September 29th and concerned a green light seen at Las Cruces, N. M. and Cloudcroft. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Agency stated that their instruments indicated the UFO was 37 miles above the earth.

The object appeared to hover for about thirty minutes and then moved off toward the southwest. According to the F.A.A., the UFO was spherical, and had a square object within it. They said that flashing lights of various colors appeared to emanate from the square object within the sphere. Two unidentified pilots - one of them flying a military jet - reportedly spotted the UFO, as did many people on the ground, including police.
