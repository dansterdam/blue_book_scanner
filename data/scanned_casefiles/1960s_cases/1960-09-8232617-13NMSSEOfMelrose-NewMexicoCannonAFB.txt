UFO sighting

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Base narrative text on AF Form 112)
The object is described as having a highly reflective surface. Its appearance is approximately the same size as the observations supposes the device used by some organization or base in the area. Further, since there have been no sightings of other lights, this rules out the slow rate of descent and supports the contention that this object is a balloon or a device.
