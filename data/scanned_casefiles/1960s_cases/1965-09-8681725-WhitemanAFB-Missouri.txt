(l) The preparing officer has no comments or conjecture as to what may have been the source of the light these two airmen saw. Apparently they were the only two individuals to observe the light. A weather observer at his station near the runway did not see it nor any of the control tower personnel. Nothing unusual was observed on the FAA Kansas City radar. Airman Bolding stated that he has seen similar objects before at Whiteman AFB and that other personnel had seen them as well. Apparently no report was made in these instances.

1. No physical evidence exists of these sightings.
