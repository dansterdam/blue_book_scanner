4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
30 Sec Obj, 20 Min Trash

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer looking South. White light, round in shape began to glow until it reached an intensity slightly greater than the brightest star and slightly larger than the largest star visible at that time. Believed to be 500 miles above the horizon and SW of his position. Object moved upward leaving trail 10 miles wide. Traveled upward (Flight to NE following contour of Earth, likely). Trail remained visible for 30 minutes before dissipating.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
Upward NE likely

8. PHOTOS
□ Yes
■ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
□ Yes
■ No

COMMENTS: Four portions of Cosmos 57 breakup noted during this period. However this object reportedly burned out at a high elevation in the SW. The duration is rather long for a meteor as is the persistence of the trail. Sighting evaluated as meteor or Satellite Decay. Feature of trail Decay not ruled out.

UFO Observation, 27 Feb 65, Captain Mosley                     1 Apr 65

WRBB
Robins AFB, Georgia

1. We have received a report from AJACI-O, Office of the Deputy
Chief of Staff, Intelligence, 17 Mar 65, regarding an observation
by Captain Mosley on the night of 27 February 1965.

2. This observation was either a meteor or a portion of a satellite
decay. Four objects were recorded by SPADATS as re-entering on/or
about this date. Initial observation was to the Southwest and the
object reported as moving upward. This motion can be interpreted
as being to the Northeast following the curvature of the earth.

3. Observations of this nature are desired not only by the United
States Air Force but also by NASA and the President of the American
Meteor Society, Dr Charles Olivier. If the object is known to be
a meteor it should be reported to the American Meteor Society. If
the observation is consistent with, or has characteristics of, a
satellite decay it should be reported to:

Aerial Phenomena Branch (TDEW)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

4. Reports of satellite decays are not considered as UFO reports
but should be reported as possible Moon Dust Observations.

Dear Dr Olivier,

We have received a report of a meteor or satellite decay at approximately 2315 hours on 27 Feb 65 in the North Carolina, Virginia area. This observation was made by a Captain Mosley. He was facing South when he saw a white light, round in shape, which began to grow until it reached an intensity slightly brighter than the brightest star.

Its size was slightly larger than the largest visible star. It was located approximately 300 miles above the horizon and southwest to his position. No sound accompanied this sighting. As the glow reached its brightest, the object began to move upward and trailing a trail of white smoke about 10 mile wide. It traveled upward for about thirty seconds, then the light went out. The smoke trail remained visible for about 30 minutes until dissipated by the wind.

This is all the information which we have regarding this particular observation. It is forwarded to you because of the unusual duration and the persistence of the trail. It is possible that this observation is associated with re-entry of space debris since four objects were known to re-enter the atmosphere on 27 - 28 February 1965.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch

2. This "Unidentified Flying Object" was sighted on the night of 27 February 1965 and not reported to Robins Air Force Base until 19 March 1965. Due to the lapse of time between the sighting and the reporting of the sighting to this base for investigation, it does not appear feasible to conduct any further inquiry into this incident.
