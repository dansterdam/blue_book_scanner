UFO Observation & Photographs, 7 July 1967

Appleton, Wisconsin 54911

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of 7 July 1967. Photo analysis has been accomplished with the following results:

a. Examination reveals that the "unidentified object" is partially visible along the left margin of the negative, and that the imagery is not the result of double exposure or retouching. The object is not visible in its entirety due to the fact that about 1/5 inch has been cropped from the left margin of the negative. The object appears to be symmetrical and it therefore could be assumed that about 80 percent of its imagery remains. Also imaged is a TV antenna which extends from the center of the bottom edge of the negative almost to the center of the format. Source indicates the antenna is attached to his neighbor's house.

b. The object's image is elliptical in shape, its length being about twice its width. It displays medium reflectivity and is fuzzy around the perimeter. A narrow band displaying slightly greater reflectivity is positioned along the axis. No reason or purpose has been established for this change in tone.

c. The exposure was made with a fixed focus camera having a nominal .26 foot focal length lens. Source states that the object was 100-200 feet in diameter and hovered about 200 feet above his neighbor's house at the time he made the exposure. The clarity of detail and relative size of the antenna suggest source was perhaps 75 feet from his neighbor's house and not more than 220 feet from the object as it hovered 200 feet above the house.

d. If, indeed, the object had the 100-200 foot diameter (as stated by source) it would have had to be 800-1,600 feet from the camera to

Here is the text from the document:

produce the image size shown, and therefore would be in relatively sharp focus. Contrarily, if it were hovering 220 feet from the camera, its diameter would have to be approximately 30 feet to produce the image size shown, and it would also be in sharp focus.

d. The object imaged on the photograph, not being in sharp focus, could not have been hovering, and does not appear to have dimensions as great as those estimated by source.

f. Although the object on the negative cannot be identified, it appears to be circular in planform and situated between the camera and antenna. Its diameter is estimated to be 1 to 1.5 feet at a range of approximately 15 feet.

2. We are returning your original negative and photograph. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

COMPLAINT DETAILS

Greg Verhoeven, age 14, stopped at the station with a photo he took of what he thought could be an U.F.O. This photo showed an end on object in the sky. Greg states this U.F.O. came out of the east in area of old airport. Greg further states this vehicle hovered for a short time and departed to the west faster than a jet aircraft. The craft was estimated in size at 100 to 200 feet in diameter if on the ground. Color is yellow. Greg states it was lower than an inflight air craft.

The photo was taken with box camera number 620 black and white Kodafilm and processed by Ideal Photo. There are no adjustments for or speed on the camera. Greg was told to submit the photo to Maj Patterson, Air Force base for review.

P NRS      One Argoflex 75 negative and print, two FTD enlargements

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 68-35, submitted by Major Quintanilla, requesting analysis of an "unidentified object" imaged on a photo negative.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination reveals that the "unidentified object" is partially visible along the left margin of the negative, and that the imagery is not the result of double exposure or retouching. The object is not visible in its entirety due to the fact that about 1/5 inch has been cropped from the left margin of the negative. The object appears to be symmetrical and it therefore could be assumed that about 80 percent of its imagery remains. Also imaged is a T.V. antenna which extends from the center of the bottom edge of the negative almost to the center of the format. Source indicates the antenna is attached to his neighbor's house.

3. The object's image is elliptical in shape, its length being about twice its width. It displays medium reflectivity and is fuzzy around the perimeter. A narrow band displaying slightly greater reflectivity is positioned along its minor axis. No reason or purpose has been established for this strange in tone.

4. The exposure was made with a fixed focus camera having a nominal .26 foot focal length lens. Source states that the object was 100-200 feet in diameter and hovered about 200 feet above his neighbor's house at the time he made the exposure. The clarity of detail and relative size of the antenna indicated that source was perhaps 75 feet from the object as it hovered 200 feet above the house, and not more than 220 feet from the object as it hovered 200 feet above the house.

5. If, indeed, the object had the 100-200 foot diameter (as stated by source) it would have had to be 800-1,600 feet from the camera to produce the image size shown, and therefore would be in relatively sharp focus. Contrarily, if it were hovering 200 feet from the camera, its diameter would have to be approximately 30 feet to produce the image size shown, and it would also be in sharp focus.

6. The object imaged on the photograph, not being in sharp focus, could not have been hovering, and does not appear to have dimensions as great as those estimated by source.

7. Although the object on the negative cannot be identified, it appears to be circular in platform and situated between the camera and antenna. Its diameter is estimated to be 1 to 1.5 feet and at a range of approximately 15 feet.

I apologize, but I cannot discern any legible text in this image. The document appears to be a black and white photograph with varying shades of gray and some blurry lines or shapes, but no clear text is visible. The image looks like it might be a scientific or investigative document, possibly related to the UFO report mentioned in the filename, but the details are too obscured to read.

The image appears to be a very faint, low-contrast document page. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor image quality. I can make out a few partial words or fragments on the left side of the page, but I cannot confidently reproduce them without risking inaccuracy. The page seems to be part of an official document, with some markings and lines visible, but the details are too unclear to transcribe with certainty.
