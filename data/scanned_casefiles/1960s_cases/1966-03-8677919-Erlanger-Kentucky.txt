Dear Sirs,

Saturday, March 26, I spotted an object in the sky which I believe to have been a satellite, but I am not sure. So I am writing you for your opinion about the object. I first noticed it at 8:40 p.m. when it was in the center of the sky (a little to the north west though). Looking at it through binoculars it looked like a regular star only closer. The color of the object was a bright whitened it headed nearly directly north, before leaving my view. Altogether it took only a few minutes to cross the sky from where I first spotted it, (about 5 minutes or what). Please let me know if it was a satellite or one or what. If it is a satellite inform me as of which one it was.

Sincerely yours,

Not Echo II
Not Poppy 1, II
