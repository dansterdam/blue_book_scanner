SECTION 11 of 11
THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY LINDSEY AS A CYLINDRICAL OBJECT WITH LIGHTS AROUND IT. HE WATCHED IT FOR 2 OR 3 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN LEVEL FLIGHT. THE REPORT STATES THAT THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY 70 TO 80 FEET LONG AND 20 TO 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THIS EVENT OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 2025 HOURS LOCAL TIME ON 5 SEPTEMBER 1962. WHILE THE REPORT GIVES DETAILED OBSERVATIONS, IT CONTAINS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE EVENT WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECT WAS NOT REPORTED TO BE MANEUVERING IN ANY UNUSUAL MANNER, AND IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN LEVEL FLIGHT INDICATING IT WAS PROBABLY SOME TYPE OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE BRIEF DURATION OF SIGHTING AND LACK OF UNCONVENTIONAL MANEUVERS MAKES IT DOUBTFUL THAT THIS EVENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A PROBABLE UFO.
