Vol. XXVI, No. 1                CONTENTS                        JULY, 1963

COVER: On September 26, 1962, shortly after sunset, a brilliant fireball was seen through
        our local from places as widely separated as 400 kilometers north of Beersheba
        in southern Israel, took the front-cover photograph of the meteor's long-enduring train.
        The train is a Polishare curve at 17d, exposure 1/125 second on Ilford FP3 film. At his
        location the train was 30-40 degrees above the horizon. (See adjoining column.)

2. Analyzing artificial space object was apparently consumed prior to ground impact. This Detachment has no information or rumor of actual impact of an object at that time. Reports from the Air Attache, Cairo, which could help locate the nadir point, are presently being requested. Any further collection will be forwarded.

AZIMUTH, C. FIRST SIGHTING WAS APPROX 50 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON WITH
SLIGHTLY ARCED DESCENT TOWARD EAST AT OVERALL ANGLE OF 18 DEGREES
FROM VERTICAL. DESCENT APPEARED AS WHITE FALLING STAR TO APPROX 35
DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON, CHANGING TO GREENISH BLUE AND DESCENDING TO
APPROX 25 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON, CHANGING TO ORANGE FIREBALL
EFFECT. DESCENDING TO HORIZON. TOTAL LAPSED TIME OF DESCENT WAS 4 OR 5
SECONDS. DIRECTION WAS APPROX 190 DEGREES FROM OBSERVER AND TRAIL
VISIBLE THROUGHOUT TIME AIRA WAS DRIVING TO 2ND POSITION. 3 OTHER PERSONNEL IN CAR OBSERVED
EVENT IN SAME MANNER. WEATHER WAS CLEAR, VISIBILITY UNLIMITED AND
NO RPRT NO SOUNDS WERE HEARD. TRAIL THAT FOLLOWED EVENT LEFT THIS

Here is the text from the document:

AZIMUTH OF THE TOP OF THE TRAIL APPROX AS REPORTED ABOVE. PICTURES CONFIRM AIRA'S OBSERVATION THAT UPPER HALF OF TRAIL DISPERSED FAIRLY RAPIDLY BECAUSE OF WIND VELOCITY AND WIND SHEAR BUT LOWER HALF OF TRAJECTORY REMAINED FAIRLY CONSTANT THROUGHOUT TIME TRAIL WAS VISIBLE. PRESS REPORTS IN ISRAEL REVEAL THAT THIS PHENOMENON OBSERVED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL THE WAY FROM METULLA TO EILAT. A SCIENCE TEACHER, MR. [REDACTED] WHO IS MEMBER OF BOTH AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS SOCIETY IN JERUSALEM AND AMERICAN METEOR SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA REPORTED HE SAW FROM A POINT NEAR HAIFA A LUMINOUS BODY AT 5:45 PM FALL SLOWLY IN SOUTH SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AND VANISH 4 SECONDS LATER AT ABOUT 5 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON. ITS INITIAL LIGHT HE SAID WAS ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THAT OF THE MOON. JUDGING BY TAIL OF THE LIGHT THAT REMAINED FOUR 40 MINUTES HE THOUGHT WAS EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE METEOR. [REDACTED] ENGINEER WATCHED A BRIGHT LIGHT AT A DISTANCE OF "30 KILOMETERS". IT BURNED A BLUISH WHITE AND LEFT A TRAIL OF SMOKE VISIBLE FOR 50 MINUTES. PHENOMENON WAS DESCRIBED AS A FIREBALL BY PRO YA ACOV BENTOR, DIRECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY, GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. HE EXPLAINED TO REPORTERS THAT IT WAS A PIECE OF COSMIC METAL OR STONE ATTRACTED BY THE EARTH'S GRAVITY. IN GENERAL THESE REPORTS TEND TO CONFIRM OBSERVATIONS AS REPORTED BY THIS OFFICE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE SPURIOUS REPORTS BY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THEY SAW PHENOMENON GOING UP, RATHER THAN COMING DOWN, THAT PHENOMENON WAS ROCKET LAUNCHED FROM JORDAN, ROCKET LAUNCHED FROM SAUDI ARABIA, ETC. AIRA 100 PERCENT POSITIVE AND PICTURES PROVE THESE SPURIOUS REPORTS INCORRECT.
