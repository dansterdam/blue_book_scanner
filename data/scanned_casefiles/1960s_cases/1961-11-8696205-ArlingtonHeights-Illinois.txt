WITH THE REPORT OF THIS SIGHTING: AT APPROXIMATELY 0755Z, 7 NOV
1961, SEVERAL EMPLOYEES OF MARTIN COMPANY AND ARMY PERSONNEL AT
COMMUNICATOR (45 ARTY BRIGADE) OBSERVED THREE UNUSUAL RADAR
RETURNS ON THE LONG RANGE RADAR. THREE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED
APPROACHING THE CHICAGO AREA FROM ESE WITH 30 SECOND SEPARATION
AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 4000 KNOTS (FOUR THOUSAND KNOTS) THE
RADAR RETURN WAS VERY SHARP WITH THE VIDEO TILTED ABOUT 30 DEGREES
DUE TO THE GIGH SPEED OF OBJECTS. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO
DETERMINE THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECTS BUT THEIR SPEED WAS BEYOND
CAPABILITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. THE FIRST TWO OBJECTS VANISHED
IN THE GROUND CLUTTER AND DID NOT REAPPEAR. THE THIRD OBJECT
VANISHED ABOUT 100,000 YARDS PRIOR TO REACHING THE GROUND CLUTTER.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THESE SIGHTINGS, THE EQUIPMENT WAS TESTED AND
