11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted two lights with no clear outlines; each object had a red and a white blinking light. Object #1 moved through the night, red and white lights were observed and disappeared in the west near the horizon.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. Due to the limited information on object #2 it is assumed it was an aircraft. As was also noted, a local airport was conducting night operations approximately 12 miles southeast of Roscoe.

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:
1. V-244 North, west to southeast at approximately 3 miles East of Roscoe.
2. V-249 ENE to SSE approximately 4 miles East of Roscoe.
3. V-241 was approximately 12 miles East of Roscoe.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Due to the flying conditions outlined dr paragraph 4 and the close proximity, possible air traffic in the area might explain object #1. Due to the limited information available on object #2 I can only assume it was also an aircraft as outlined in paragraph J.
