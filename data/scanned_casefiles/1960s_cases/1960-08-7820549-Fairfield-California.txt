B.
INVESTIGATION AS TO COLLECTION OF INFORMATION HAS REVEALED THAT
ON 8 AUGUST, 1960, CAPT REPORTED TO OPERATING BASE, FAIRFIELD,
CONN, THAT HE HAD OBSERVED AN UNUSUAL AERIAL VEHICLE, WHICH HE
DESCRIBED AS A CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT APPROXIMATELY 75 FEET LONG, AND
ABOUT 15 FEET IN DIAMETER. CAPT STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS
HOVERING SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, AND WAS
PERIODICALLY EMITTING A PULSATING RED AND BLUE LIGHT. CAPT
STATED THAT HE WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES,
DURING WHICH TIME IT REMAINED STATIONARY, EXCEPT FOR OCCASIONAL
UP AND DOWN MOVEMENTS. CAPT STATED THAT HIS OBSERVATION WAS
SUBSTANTIATED BY TWO WITNESSES WHO WERE PRESENT ON BASE AT THAT
TIME. CAPT A CIVILIAN PILOT, HAVING BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE IN THE PAST, AND IS CONSIDERED RELIABLE.
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT CAPT 'S SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY A GENUINE
OBSERVATION OF SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE,
FROM THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, TO IDENTIFY OR CLASSIFY THE
OBJECT.
