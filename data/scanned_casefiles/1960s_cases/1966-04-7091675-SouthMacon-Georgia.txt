The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is an investigation report of an unidentified flying object sighting.

The text on the document states:

"PAGE 3 RUSSO 496 UNGLAS INFORMATION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT BY MONITORING THE MACON POLICE RADIO. PHOTOGRAPH CANNOT BE OBTAINED UNTIL MONDAY, 2 MAY 1966, DUE TO IT BEING UTILIZED IN NEWS PROGRAM BY WMAZ TV. THE PHOTOGRAPH WILL BE FORWARDED AT THAT TIME."

The text also mentions that the object was sighted at the Macon Municipal Airport, Cochran Field, and that the Weather Bureau in Montgomery, Alabama had no weather balloons aloft at that time. It states that the object was sighted, but no positive identification could be made due to lack of physical evidence.
