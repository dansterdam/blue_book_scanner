Gentlemen,

Enclosed is an itemized list about the strange appearance my wife happened to see when we were lounging in our house on the night of July 28th, 1960. This listing has been based on the ATIC (United States Air Force Technical Information Sheet) Form AA, Amended III of the book of "Flying Saucers From Outer Space" by Mr. Donald E. Keyhoe, Wellington, Alexandria, Va. (1958), and printed by Hutchinson & Co., Ltd., England, circa 1958. Since I do not have any other from I do not think it feasible to send this only one; and I would like to ask that I would be pleased if you might kindly send me a few more of these forms in case I may need them in the future.

This strange object happened to zoom above my opposite direction as I was facing my speaker in my easy chair and of very short duration (1 to 2 seconds) so that I could not see it but its awesome effect was most astonishing to observe as I was remarked "Hi!... What is this!", almost swallowing her small tongue. Ahrens as I was I tried to watch the sky and to my surprise I could detect two other objects during the next 20 minutes, which might perhaps be remembered to citing stars, the first one being larger than the second one, high around the zenith, at approx. 10 minutes intervals and of still shorter duration in other directions of the first sighting listed on the attachment.

It is with the hope that this information might be of some use for your investigations I am sending this letter.

Yours truly,

Address: Yenisehir, Ankara, Turkey

Encl: 1 list.
