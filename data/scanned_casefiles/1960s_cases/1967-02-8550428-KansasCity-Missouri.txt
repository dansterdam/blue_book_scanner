SUBJECT:   UFO Observation, 1 Feb 67

TO:   Mr. 
Kansas City, Missouri 64131

Reference your unidentified observation.  The information which you have submitted is not sufficient for a scientific evaluation.  Request you complete the attached AFD Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided.  Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

JAMES G. MANATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Systemsystems

Dear Sir:
Thank you for your inquiry into my UFO.  I must say I am very glad to have the chance to report ing my UFO. I believe I have discovered what it was.  The night I saw it, the sky was very cloudy and foggy.  About 9:30 p.m., there appeared in the same place what looked like an extremely bright star, red in color, as it was before. Only this time it was just a little cloud, very small, and very distinct under the clouds and very dark. I saw was the bottom of the moon, very red, covered by clouds and very dark.

An embarrassed UFO spotter,

Mr. —————, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64131

Dear Mr. —————:

Reference your correspondence of March 2A, 1967 regarding your sighting of an unidentified flying object.

I wish to personally thank you for contacting this office in regard to your observation. It was very concerned because I know you are not the only individual who has viewed a normal phenomena under unusual conditions and at first believed it to be an unidentified flying object. Again, many thanks for the note.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
