ATTN OF:    TDET/UFO                                                17 March 1967

TO:         Mr. [redacted]

Reference your unidentified observation. The information which we have received is not sufficient for a scientific evaluation. Request you complete the attached FTD Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

JAMES G. MANATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems                1 Atch
                                                     FTD Form 164 w/envelope
                                                     March 24, 1967

Dear Sir:

Thank you for your inquiry into my UFO. I must say I am very red faced! Since reporting my UFO -?, I believe I have discovered what I was. The night I saw the object was very cloudy and foggy. About a week or so after my sighting I saw the object in the same place, yet in color as it was before. Only this time it was just a little cloudy and I could determine it was the moon! I switched and I changed colors as before. I feel what I saw was the bottom of the moon, very red, covered by clouds and very foggy.

An embarrassed UFO spotter,
[signature redacted]

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Reference your correspondence of March 24, 1967 regarding your explanation for your observation.

I wish to personally thank you for contacting this office in regards to your explanation. Don't be too concerned, because I know you are not the only individual who has viewed a normal phenomenon under unusual conditions and at first believed it to be an unidentified flying object. Only a very few persons, though, ever contact us with a possible explanation. Again, many thanks for the note.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
