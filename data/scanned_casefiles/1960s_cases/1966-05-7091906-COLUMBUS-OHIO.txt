The image shows a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The page contains two sections with instructions and diagrams.

The first section instructs the viewer to imagine a point on a curved line and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. It also asks the viewer to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was last seen.

The second section instructs the viewer to draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, placing an "A" at the beginning of the path and a "B" at the end of the path, and showing any changes in direction during the course.
