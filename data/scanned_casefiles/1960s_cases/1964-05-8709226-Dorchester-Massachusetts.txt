MAY 30, 1964

DEAR SIRS:

TONIGHT, WHILE WE WERE ON OUR BACK PORCH OBSERVING PLANES COMING INTO AND LEAVING LOGAN AIRPORT, WE SAW A VERY STRANGE OBJECT, WE NOTED IT IN FIRST WHEN IT WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE TIME WAS 9:55 P.M. ON THIS DATE (MAY 30, 1964). IT MOVED VERY SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY, IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT WHITE COLOR. ONCE HOWEVER IT GREW ALMOST A POINT OF GLOW OVERHEAD. IT MOVED IN A VERY SHALLOW ZIG-ZAG PATTERN. THIS WAS HARDLY NOTICEABLE HOWEVER. SIGHTING LASTED SIX MINUTES UNTIL 10:01 P.M. UNTIL OBJECT WAS HAD PASSED BEHIND SEVERAL BUILDINGS, WHEN LAST OBSERVED IT WAS 30 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON. WEATHER WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WITH MANY STARS VISIBLE. THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BEE-BEE HELD AT ARMS LENGTH, APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH IN THE SKY. IT SEEMED TO BE ROUND IN SHAPE.

SINCERELY,

[Signature and name are blacked out]

There are also some handwritten notes at the bottom of the page, including "Echo I" and some additional notes about time and location.

Dear [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of May 30, 1964, in which you reported seeing an object in the sky during the evening on that date.

The object you both saw was Echo I, which was over your area at approximately 9:51 p.m. on May 30th, south of you, 88Â° above the horizon, moving southwest.

You both gave a very fine description of Echo I. In your detailed description made it possible to identify this satellite quickly and positively.

Sincerely,
