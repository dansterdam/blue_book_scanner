Here is the OCR text from the document:

1. Winter 11 pts from the B-52 passed over plane that landed at
Kadena approximately 13 minutes after the scheduled time. At Okinawa
etc. (time of sighting is estimated as the observer did not have a
watch). The landing runway at Kadena AFB was 05. The aircraft did not have a
best 05. If the aircraft landed on 05, and observed on a right base
for 05, he would cross runway 05/14/05 close to the watch tower (north
touch). Several cloud layers were reported at the 05/14/05 observation.
2. The observer (SSgt) reported that at 3000 ft, while flying a
right hand trail formation, he observed the B-52 through holes in the
clouds and was able to say they could be seen through these clouds. This
with him lead generally to be aware of the B-52 was a/c he was
aircraft concerned. Observer stated however that he could remember no
specific details. An observer at Kadena said he was on the ground at
Kadena, approached would not necessarily draw such notice.

2. The possibility that the sonic flight could have caused the
sighting is remote due to the distance of the impact point (approximately
250+ NM) from site.

3. The presence of low clouds (7000) to the site could have
caused reflections of lights from the ground.

4. When interviewed the observer appeared to be reliable.
However, several facts could be brought out. As of the interview,
15, both soldiers were on the grass, at night, distinctly both
talking. These soldiers have a good case of nervousness, their lack of
familiarity with flying objects.

5. The Okinawa Air Defense Control Center was notified of the
sighting of reporting and indicated no unusual sightings of familiar
tracks.
