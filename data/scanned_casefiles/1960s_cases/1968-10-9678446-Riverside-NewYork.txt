Dear Capt. Thomaker,

The enclosed pictures are best ones that we took. We saw the object at 4:00 PM Thursday on 16th floor of Spyview. These are our names.

When we first saw it it was black and oval shaped. It moves up and down. (Its on top of the George Washington Bridge but a little further now its 4:30 and the object is standing still but its tempo change. We can't really tell you how its moving because sometimes it moves up and down and other times it stands still.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. There are some faint markings and text at the bottom of each image section, but they are not clearly readable. The page appears to contain two similar black and white images that look like blurry, low-contrast photographs, but the details are too indistinct to describe with any certainty.
