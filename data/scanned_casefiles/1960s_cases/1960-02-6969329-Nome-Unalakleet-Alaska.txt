SUBJECT: Extract from ATIC Duty Officers Report                                16 February 1960

TO: AFCIN-42

Following is an extract from ATIC Duty Officer, Captain G. W. Wessel report dated 15 Feb to 16 Feb 60 for your information:

1730 - Anchorage, February 15 - A mysterious object hurtled through Western Alaska yesterday from the direction of Russian Siberia, the Anchorage Times reported today. A WIEN-Alaska Airlines employee at Noame, said the flame belching object appeared to be a manned aircraft traveling at tremendous speed at 2000 to 3000 feet above the earth. The direction told the times that the object was headed SE in the direction of this Alaskan metropolis and was sighted later at Unalakleet and St. Michael about 150 miles across Norton Sound from Noame.

He described the object as a silvery and tubular, some-what like a jet plane with orange flames shooting from the tail. He was unable to tell if it had wings. Others who saw the mysterious aerial intruder said it curved up and away as it approached Cape Nome, as if it was manned and controlled. The FAA station manager at Nome speculated that the object might have been a friendly jet. "No some assignment we didn't know about." It was not sighted in the Anchorage area. Military sources here declined comment about the sightings.

2030 - Received a call from a Major O'Brien, HQ USAF calling ATIC's attention to Associated Press release #200 reporting on a mysterious object crossing Alaska from direction of Soviet Siberia. Object was cylinder shaped, traveling at high rate of speed (2,000 feet alt) and was sighted at two points. Major O'Brien stated that he had called Alaska and that a special team was working on the sighting. Major O'Brien suggested ATIC might want to alert ATILO personnel in Alaska.

2035 - Called Mr. [redacted] and related above. Asked availability of AP wire. Mr. [redacted] informed 500 ATIC only has UPI wire, but that he would be able to obtain full copy of AP release from local newspaper sources. Mr. [redacted] stated he would contact Mr. [redacted]

- page 3 -

2100 - On calling Major Davis learned ATIC has no ATILO assigned Alaska.

2120 - Received full text of AP stay from Mr. [redacted]

2140 - Related above to Colonel Lundquist.

2155 - Related above to Colonel Evans after trying unsuccessfully to reach Colonel Tisdale, Major French and Colonel Snoop."

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: INF
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Secretary of the Air Force (SAFOI-3)
Wash 25 DC

1. On Sunday 14 February 1960 an unidentified flying object was sighted in the sky between Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska by a number of civilians and reported to this Headquarters through 11th Air Division (D), Ladd Air Force Base. Immediate investigation was begun and reports forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

2. The Office of Information, Headquarters, Alaskan Air Command, was queried as to whether or not these sightings had been reported and the information was given that they had. Media within the ZI contacted NORAD Headquarters and also received confirmation that the reports had been received. The resulting press story was so written it left an inference that an object had been sighted by the Air Force presumably by radar.

3. The investigation of the sighting conducted by personnel at Ladd Air Force Base identified this object as a meteor and local press speculation as to the sources and identity of the object was so intense we locally released the fact that it was a meteor. Subsequently, letters have been received from the civilian populace concerning this object and in accordance with paragraph 8, AFR 200-2 these letters are being forwarded. (Attachment 1 & 2.)

4. With reference to the letter from Mr. [REDACTED] (Attachment 3), the Chief of Staff this Headquarters, initiated correspondence to Mr. [REDACTED] thanking him for reporting the object and getting it into Air Force channels. (Attachment 3)

5. In addition to his letter to Colonel Isbell, Mr. [REDACTED] provided the local press with a statement concerning his disagreement with the published identification of this object (Attachment 4). All subsequent letters regarding this particular sighting will be forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

- page 13 -

On 6 March 1960 an additional unidentified object was reported in the same general area between Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska. This report originated with an airline pilot and was described as being a bright flash seeming to result from an explosion behind the aircraft flying at about 4500 feet altitude, 86 miles south of Nome. Both the pilot and co-pilot reported that the flash was so bright that they were both blinded for approximately 2 seconds. However, they heard no sound. The only passenger aboard the aircraft was asleep and heard or saw nothing. Two individuals on the ground reported seeing a flash, a 14 year old girl in Nome, and the town marshal of Nome. Interested investigation was begun by Ladd Air Force Base the-nearest Air Force establishment to this area and reports are being forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

6. The initial press inquiry on this latest sighting was received 8 March 1960. The man quoted as reporting this incident to the press was Mr. [redacted] who has not been mentioned in any of the reports concerning this object. We did confirm the fact to the press that this unidentified object was reported to us and that we have forwarded this report to Headquarters, United States Air Force.

Colonel James W. Isbell
Commander, USAF
APO 942, Seattle, Washington

Dear Colonel Isbell,

Your letter of February 17th received, and I do appreciate your letter. I am however taking exception to DR. Dreyer and the AFPS report that this object was a meteor. I am not an astronomer, engineer, however I have a fair understanding of engineering, and worked in the airline field.

Pray tell; since then have meteors been travelling on a horizontal plane? Parrellins a searchline? Could it have been some classified mission of one of the USAF 12 or 16 couldn't it be better to declare it.

If it wasn't then was it one of Russia's taking a sneak preview? I have some good substantial photographs which can tell some from other sources. I'm lead and watch it at eye level parallel the coastline.

I am writing Dr. Alvey and asking these questions of him. For I do not feel that this is a fair answer. To my knowledge there has been nothing from the "Alaska Air Command" about the object.

I sincerely feel that this represents a very detailed study. The whole coastline of Alaska is wide open and undefined. It is a small fragment of minute now here possible that could save many out what this was. As well as many other things that have been reported from it. Knowing to many past times.

Your checking, further and advising will be truly appreciated.
Thank you.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

I want to thank you for your fine cooperation and initiative in reporting the unidentified object you observed on 14 February 1960. You might be interested in knowing that a similar sighting was reported at Unalakleet forty minutes after your sighting.

Your prompt reporting of this to the FAA got the information to Air Force channels and enabled us to start an investigation at once. Your caution is sincerely appreciated.

Walsh Hits AF
Explanation Of
Mystery Object

Pete Walsh, Nome station
manager for Wien Alaska Air-
lines, said today he takes ex-
ception to a recent Air Force
report that a mystery object
spotted at Nome last month
was a meteor.

"Since when does a meteor
travel on a horizontal plane,
change course and then dis-
appear?" Walsh said.

He said he has written the
Air Force challenging its find-
ing in the matter.

"I don't believe them (t h e
Air Force)," Walsh said, add-
ing that many persons in
Nome saw the object.

He said the Air Force has
alerted its warning stations in
the Nome area to be on the
lookout for more flying ob-
jects.

Maj. Br. Thomas C. Magnavage, Jr.
Director of Legislative Liaison,
Department of Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear General Magnavage:

With the last few weeks an object was sighted from Alaska with some unusual aerial activity as a "bar" shaped, sporadic, and a meteor. Actually, there is no reason to believe that we did not detect an object in many ways common to Air Force activity. An acquaintance of mine, a resident of Nome, also be by telephone told there was a UFO he had observed, over this region. However, the AEC field office at Anchorage was a well yet unclear noting at a good number that. We are just now attempting to assess the success of this project. I will, as directed, request that the Director of the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska is confirmed the no. of a sighting.

My understanding is that the Alaskan Command has an investigative unit with this I think they will be able to learn if any conclusions were reached.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]

ATTN OF: AFOIN-4252

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, Alaska, 15 February 1960

TO: SAFOI-33 (Maj L. J. Tucker)

1. On 15 February 1960, an object described as blunt and rounded, bright in appearance, emitting sparks intermittently, and accompanied by a blue flame was seen from Nome and Unalakleet at approximately 0400Z. ATIC concludes that this object was probably a very bright meteor.

2. Of all of the information provided to ATIC concerning an UFO sighting, the most reliable is usually the general description (not to include size), direction from the observer, approximate angle of elevation, duration of the sighting (for very short periods), and the time of the sighting. Using only these factors, it was possible by trigonometric methods to determine that the object was approximately 100 mi high.

3. The description of this object, the duration of the sighting, and calculation of the 100 mile altitude led to the conclusion that this object was probably a meteor.

4. Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case Dr. Christian Elvey, Director of Geophysics Institute, Alaska University, concluded that the object of this sighting was a very bright meteor.

5. Other possibilities for the cause of this sighting; i.e., missiles, satellites, etc., were considered and ruled out due to inconsistencies; i.e., too high for jet aircraft.

6. ATIC has no information which indicates that more than one object was seen on this date. ALL of the times reported were consistent to within five minutes, a normal expected error.

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, TEAM A, SAFLL

SUBJECT: Alaska UFO Sightings

1. The following information should be used in answering Senators Bartlett and Gruening, when they reply to Mr. [redacted], President of the Nome, Alaska Chamber of Commerce.

2. There were two sightings in the Nome-Unalakleet area, the first on 14 February 1960 and the second on 6 March 1960.

1st Sighting on 14 February

a. On 14 February 1960, an object described as blunt and rounded, bright in appearance, emitting sparks intermittently, and accompanied by a blue flame was seen from Nome and Unalakleet at approximately 0600. Across Technical Anchorage Center concluded that this object was probably a very bright meteor.

b. Of all the information provided to ATIC concerning an UFO sighting the most reliable is usually the general description (not to include size), direction from the observer, approximate angle of elevation, duration of the sighting (for very short period), and the time of the sighting. Using only these factors, it was possible by trigonometry to determine that the object was approximately 100 miles high.

c. The description of this object, the direction of the sighting, and calculation of the 100 mile altitude led the conclusion that this object was probably a meteor.

d. Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case, Mr. Christian Elvey, Director of Geophysics Institute, Alaska University, concluded that the object of this sighting was a very bright meteor.

e. Other possibilities for the cause of this sighting: i.e., missiles, satellites, etc. were considered and ruled out due to inconsistencies, i.e., too high, too far, etc.

f. ATIC has no information which indicates that more than one object was seen in this data. All of the times reported were consistent to within five minutes, a normal expected error.

Sad Sighting, 6 March 1960

On 5 March 1960 an additional unidentified object was reported in the same general area near Nome, Alaska. This report originated with an airline pilot and was described as being a bright flash seeming to result from an explosion behind the aircraft flying at about 1,500 feet altitude. No other details could be obtained. The pilot and copilot reported that the flash was so bright that they were both blinded for approximately 2 seconds. However, they heard no sound. The only passenger aboard the aircraft, who also heard and saw nothing, was a 21 year old girl in Nome, and the town marshal of Nome. Investigation was accomplished by Lead Air Force.

3. Second time with fire and the report from Lead Air Force Base, there is an occurrence of opinion among witnesses of an explosion or loud noise accompanied the UFO. ATC has concluded that this was a very bright meteor known as a "fire ball" or "bolide". The only difference between a "fire ball" or "meteor" is that a loud explosion or report is also associated with "bolides".

4. Suggest Colonel J. H. Lobell, Chief of Staff, Alaskan Air Command receive copies of the letters to Commanders Bartlett and Greening.

1 MAR 1960

Dear Senator Bartlett:

The Secretary has asked me to reply to your letter concerning
recent unidentified flying objects (UFO) sightings in Alaska.

There were two recent reported sightings in the Nome-Unalakleet,
Alaska, area. The first was on 14 February 1960 and the second was
on 15 March 1960. An investigation concerning the 15 February sighting was conducted by the following information.

As reported and described in blank and unlettered, bright in appearance,
and with a white intermittently and occasionally to a white flame was
seen from Nome and Unalakleet at approximately four o'clock p.m. The
Northwest Technical Detachment center (NWDTC), Project MOONGLOW Air
Force base, Ohio, conducted this investigation in ordinary survey
bright meteor.

Of all the information provided to ATIC concerning a UFO sighting,
the most reliable is usually the general description (not to include
color). Interpretation from the survey, approximately 100 kilometers
dimension of the sighting (low over arctic periods), and the time of the
sighting. Using only these factors, it was possible, by telemetry and
reference, to determine that the object was approximately 100 miles high.
The description of this object, the duration of the sighting, and
calculation of the 100 mile altitude led to the conclusion that this
object was probably a meteor.

Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case, Mr. Christian
Strey, investigator of Geophysics Incorporated, Alaska territory, concluded
that the object in question was a very bright meteor. Other possibilities such as missiles, satellites, or others were considered but
ruled out. The 15 March sighting was, in general, very similar to
ATIC's and to information which indicates that more than one object was
seen at this time. All of these sightings were consistent to within
very narrow limits, so except for time that can normally be expected.

Letter to the Honorable S. L. Bartlett, (Continued)

The following information was developed as a result of the investigation concerning the 9 March incident near Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska. This report originated with an airline pilot, who was flying at about 1900 feet altitude, 65 miles south of Nome. The object was described as being a bright, long object with a hazy appearance.

The pilot and co-pilot reported that the flight was so bright that they were both blinded for approximately two seconds. However, they could not see any passenger aircraft, nor hear anything. Two mechanics on the ground, a 14 year old girl in Nome, and the town marshal of Nome, reported seeing a hazy object.

There is a difference of opinion among witnesses as to whether an explosion or loud noise accompanied the UFO. Some concluded that this object was a very bright type meteor known as a "fire ball" or "bolide". The only difference between the two is that a loud explosion or report is associated with the "bolide".

If you have further questions concerning these UFO sightings, I will be happy to arrange a personal meeting for your information, as a fact sheet on UFOs.

In response to an inquiry from the Honorable Ernest Gruening, United States Senate, a similar reply has been transmitted to his office.

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF INFORMATION

19 February 1960

TO: Mr. Orville S. Splitt
Director, Office of News Services
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (PA)
Department of Defense
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Splitt:

Attached for your information are copies of news items concerning civilian reports of mysterious flying objects seen over Nome, Unalakleet and other nearby points in Alaska.

These civilian reports of a flying object headed in a southeasterly direction were reported to NORAD exactly as received by Alaskan Command units. In the process it seems the story was spliced into two separate middles. Mighty in northwest, westerly and northeasterly directions. One conclusion is that the object may have been a high-speed meteor. I understand that Dr. Christensen, Geophysical Institute, Alaska University, concurs in this belief. There is certainly no doubt that many people saw something but it was not registered on any tracking facilities in this area and no other information other than sightings has been obtained.

Sincerely,

ERNEST L. SMITH

OBJECT
AT NOME

Anchorage Daily Times

Object Reported Heading In From The Bering Sea

An unidentified object, believed to be a manned aircraft, was reported flying over Alaska near Nome late yesterday afternoon.

The object was between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high and moved in a strange line at a high rate of speed. It was headed southeast, which would be toward Anchorage.

Pete Walsh of Nome told the Anchorage Times that he saw the object and that it was also seen over Unalakleet, St. Michael and two radar stations, probably the City and Northeast Cape.

WALSH SAID he believed it to be a manned aircraft, and the object appeared in the sunlight. The forward part was tubular and looked very, like a jet plane. The name of the tail was orange.

Walsh said he reported the object to Headquarters of the Alaskan Command, to the Federal Aviation Agency and to Sen. E. L. Bartlett at Washington, D.C.

The direction of light would tend to indicate that the object originated from the other side of the Bering Strait.

If the object were of Russian origin, it would be the first time of an actual instance of Soviet intrusion in the skies of Alaska. The military several times in recent years has denied that the Russians have been discovered flying over Alaska.

Dick Gallagher of Northern Aviation Co. at Nome said today in a telephone conversation that many Nome residents had seen the flying object. He himself had not.

"I've heard a lot about it and talked to a lot of people," he said.

He said persons whose observations he would trust told him they saw the object hurling through the sky, low, about 3 p.m. yesterday. It was headed southeast for Cape Nome.

Gallagher said he was told the object, upon approaching the cape, curved up and away as if it had some form of control.

Alaska
UFO Probe
Under Way
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (A) - silvery object flashed through Western Alaska skies late Sunday belching flames and leaving a dozen unanswered questions in its wake.

Was it a jet plane? If so, whose? Was it an incident?

The Alaska Air Command hopes to come up with some of the answers today.

The flame-belching object was reported by several persons from Nome to St. Michaels about 150 miles away. They said it appeared from the direction of Russian Siberia and hurtled southeast.

The reports were conflicting. Major Roy E. Haines, public information officer at Elmendorf Air Force Base here, said yesterday:

"Some had it low and slow. Some had it high and fast," he said.

Pete Walsh, Wien Airlines employee at Nome, said the object was traveling at tremendous speed. About 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the earth. He described it as silvery and tubular, somewhat like a jet plane, with orange flames shooting from the tail.

Mrs. Stanley Mollitor of Nome said "I had the appearance of a large star and was very, very brilliant white." Neither she nor Walsh could tell whether it had wings.

Observers said the mysterious object curved up and away as it approached Cape Nome, as if it was manned and controlled.

BULLETIN
NOME UFO — An unidentified object with a trail of yellow flames was reported streaking across the sky near the coast here today.

The Air Force could not explain the object but said it was picked up on radar at Nome, St. Michael, Unalakleet and St. Lawrence Island.

First reports said the object, tubular in shape, streaked across the sky from the Siberian coast line. It was spotted by Pete Walsh, an airlines station manager near here.

Walsh said it was not determined if the object had wings.

It headed eastward into Alaska, Walsh told UPI.

NORAD PROBES
FLYING OBJECT

Anchorage Daily News, Tuesday, February 16, 1960

Residents
Of Nome
Not Upset

COLORADO SPRINGS,
Colo. (UP) — Officials at the
North American Air Defense
Command (NORAD) in Colorado Springs, said today they
had received "unofficial and
unconfirmed" reports from
civilians that two unidentified flying objects were spotted over Alaska.

NORAD has begun an investigation, but said the reports, the spokesman said, were being studied.

Two reports were made to the
NORAD air combat operations center at Colorado Springs
from the Alaskan Air Command
but the Alaskan command received the information from
civilians.

It was emphasized by the
spokesman at NORAD that neither object was registered on "any
military" device such as radar.

He said one report was of a
flying object in the vicinity of
Nome, moving slowly northwest, over Unalakleet. The civilian told officials the object left vapor trails, indicating "it was a high altitude, and that if disappeared in a flash and explosion."

"We'll make an investigation," the NORAD spokesman said.

In Nome, Art Zylstra of radio station KICY said this morning that the people of that town were not "the least bit upset" about the mysterious flying object, even though many of them witnessed its flight.

The object was first sighted Sunday evening near here. It was approximately 2,000-3,000 feet above ground and appeared to be heading in a straight line at a high rate of speed toward the Anchorage area.

Pete Walsh of Nome, told UPI that the object was tubular in shape, did not appear to have wings and an orange flame was shooting out of its tail.

Meanwhile, officials at Alaskan Command remained mute on the matter. They did say, however, that a UFO had been reported and was being handled through "normal channels" as an unidentified flying object.

The spokesman said that reports on the object from civilians in Nome, Unalakleet, and other areas were conflicting.

"Some reports said the object was high and fast ... others said it was low and slow," the Air Force in Alaska said. "Besides, there were clouds in the sky at the time and it would be difficult to say anything at all about it."

The Air Force also said in Alaska that the object had been tracked by radar.

"We only have the regular reports that civilians turned in to us," the PIO officer told United Press.

Walsh said that the direction of flight tended to indicate that the object came from the outer side of the Bering Strait or from Russia.

If the object is of Russian origin it will be the first time the Soviet Union has flown into the skies of Alaska, the military said.

One member of the Armed Forces commented that if the object did come from the Siberian coast like "someone really goofed or not clothesline it."

"Also," he said, "if there really was an object there and it wasn't one of ours it sure as heck should have been tracked by the radar - that's what radar is for."

MYSTERY
OBJECTS ARE
CONFIRMED

Report Made
By American
Air Defense

Two Objects Seen
Early Monday In
Skies Over Alaska

COLORADO SPRINGS,
Colo. — A spokesman for the
North American Air Defense
Command here confirmed today that unidentified flying
objects were observed in the
skies over Alaska early Monday morning.

The spokesman said at a
combat operations center o NORAD
(Air Defense Headquarters)
received a report from northwest observation posts that
two objects were moving in
two separate areas across
Alaska.

One of the objects was reported in the vicinity of Nome.
It appeared to be moving
slowly in a northeasterly direction. The object disappeared without a trace and without giving any indication of
its size.

THE SECOND object was
reportedly sighted at Unalakleet, moving rapidly northwest at a speed sufficient to
produce contrails in the sky.
The object also produced a
flash which was assumed to
have been an explosion.

Whether the object exploded or not yet been determined but officials are making a search of the area.

In Anchorage, Alaskan Air
Command officials reported
that no additional information had been received on the flying object.

The sighting of the object
was reported through civilian
sources. The reports, its behavior ranged from "high and
fast" to "slow and slow," an
AAC spokesman said.

Reports have been evaluated and no positive identification has been made by the
military. The information has
been forwarded to the U.S.
Air Force headquarters, the
AAC said.

Civilian observers at Nome,
told the Anchorage Times
yesterday they had sighted a
mystery object shortly before
5 p.m. Sunday.

THEY SAID it was moving
in a southeasterly direction
when it went over Nome but
veered up and away when it
reached Cape Nome, several
miles to the southeast of the
community.

Wien Alaska Airlines station manager at Nome, Pete

Walsh, said he believed the
object to be a manned aircraft of sort. He described the object as tubular
and silvery with an orange
flame at the rear.

Pete's brother, Dan Walsh,
said in a telephone conversation with the Anchorage
Times, that he, too, had seen
the object. He said it appeared over Nome at about 4:40
p.m. Sunday. When he saw it,
it was flying approximately
300 to 500 feet in the air. He
described the object as looking "like a cigar or oxygen
cylinder" moving from west
to east.

PETE WALSH said when he
spotted the object it was flying at about 2,000 feet but was
descending.

A Nome housewife, Mrs.
Shirley Molitor, said the object looked like the flare
from a jet — it had the appearance of a large star and was
a very, very brilliant white.
She said it was going very
fast and the "exact path"
glimpse of it.

Alaska Air Command Probes
Reports of Silver Object in Sky

ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Feb. 16 (AP) — A silvery object object was traveling at tremendous speed about 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the earth, belching flames and leaving a dozen un-verified as yet sightings.

Was it a jet plane? If so, where? Was it an unidentified flying object?

The Alaska Air Command hopes to come up with some clear answers Tuesday.

The flame-belching object was reported by several persons about Nome to St. Michael and about 150 miles away. They said it appeared from the direction of Russian Siberia and hurled southeasterly.

The reports were conflicting. Major Roy E. Haines, public information officer at Elmendorf Air Force Base here, said Monday.

"Some had it low and slow, some had it high and fast."

In Fairbanks, might have been sighted in the vicinity of the time of the sightings.

Haines said there were no known flights planned for the area at that time.

A spokesman for the North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs said it had no report on the object.

"It is now an 'unknown'," he said. "Certainly would have a report on it."

Observers said the mysterious object curved up and away as it approached Cape Nome, and it was manned and controlled.

Haines said an investigation was started immediately. Radar records of two stations both at Nome were to be checked. Officers also were trying to determine whether flying objects from either three-

Mrs. Stanley Molitor of Nome said "it had the appearance of a jet and was a very brilliant white." Neither she nor Walsh could tell whether it had wings.

SECOND ALASKA SIGHTING
IN THESE WEEKS

On the 16th of February, a flame-like object, located in space, was seen through Alaskan skies over Nome. The object was sighted later at Unalakleet, and at Michael, and across Norton Sound from Nome.

This sighting, with more than a casual amount of physical description of the object, came in the 12th of February, a statement for the USAF, Nome, Alaska area office.

From Colorado Springs, Colo., confirmed that "unidentified flying object" was seen at Alaska, early on the 16th. Michael, other area natives, a vessel on patrol, and at Unalakleet, all reported that at least one object was seen on the 16th.

The NICAP newspaper said that Elm Park USAF at Colorado Springs received a report on the 16th that two unidentified objects were seen, moving in opposite directions across Alaska. Also revealed: the NORAD tracking station at Unalakleet reported the object which was sighted at Unalakleet was "round and bright."

The Associated Press report of the incident also noted that the object sighted 16 February was later identified as a white hot meteor. Who used it as a such, the Navy never revealed. A final decision, was not announced but the fact that at least one of the objects sighted in February was flying at low speed was not explained. It could not have been a meteor, if the description of the object was accurate. Also the Navy, which drew possibly, was unable to explain the object.

THE A.P.A. BULLETIN

was sounding to have been an "unknown" object different in size and shape. At Nome, a West Alaska Airlines employee saw the object and reported it appeared to be a marked aircraft traveling at tremendous speed. At 2:00 p.m. 16th above the port, it was confirmed by two radar stations near Nome. Although positioned by radar, no estimates of speed were given.

By officials, we cannot position the possibility that this object or these objects were Soviet reconnaissance. But it appears it is difficult to explain the close passage of these objects. These objects are in direct movement at Wainwright, One on Thursday, 18 December, the other on Friday, 18 of the following January, 1960.

On the 6th of March, Mr. Walsh again sighted an unidentified object in the Nome area. On a television interview, William A. Bean, Walsh said that a bright flash in the sky was followed by a ball out, followed by an explosion. After the flash like bright object was seen "drifting" to earth from the east, Walsh told the governor. The Alaska Air Command forwarded the report to NORAD at Colorado Springs, Colo. and the USAF in Washington D.C. This is more in the nature of an intelligence item than an operations problem, the governor said.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Hq. AAC, 19 February 1960---Reports made public by the Alaskan Air Command indicate the unidentified flying object sighted in the skies in Northwestern Alaska last Sunday was an extremely high speed white hot meteor at very high altitude. It is believed this object was traveling at a much higher speed than any known satellite and due to the tremendous speed, missiles and rockets have been ruled out. These conclusions were forwarded to Headquarters, United States Air Force, by Alaskan Air Command.

Dr. Christian T. Elvey, Director, Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, and a member of the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, concurred in the findings.

These conclusions are based on eye witness sightings at Nome, St. Michael, Unalakleet, and Holikachuk and systems of triangular computations. The meteor was sighted over an area of approximately 180 nautical miles, traveling in a relatively straight line Northwest to Southeast. Sightings were mostly of five to ten seconds duration indicating tremendous speed at a very high altitude in conjunction with the angle and azimuth of observation and disappearance.

It has definitely been confirmed that this meteor was traveling at a much higher rate of speed than any satellite and out of the normal satellite orbit pattern.

Dr. Elvey stated in his concurrence there is no doubt in his mind that it was never anything other than a white hot meteor traveling at an extremely high speed and at a very high altitude.
