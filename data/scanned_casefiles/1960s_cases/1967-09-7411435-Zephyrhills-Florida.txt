Draft. Data:                                                 Sept 10
                                                Zephyrhills, Florida

Dear Mr. [redacted]

With further reference to your letter of September 13, and the reply signed on October 2 by Colonel Ettenson, we have received the following information from our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Without additional information, it is impossible, at this time, to offer an explanation as to what you saw. If you will complete the attached questionnaire and send it to the address given on the enclosed postage-free envelope, provided for your convenience, the people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to perform an investigation and make an evaluation.

It is important for an individual to report his sighting as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation, in your case McDill AFB, Tampa, Florida. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a much better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

No other unidentified flying object reports for September 10 were received from the State of Florida.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES

DON'T FORGET

The rest of the text appears to be handwritten and partially illegible. Some words and phrases are discernible, but not enough to confidently transcribe the entire text. The handwriting is dense and covers most of the page, but the specific content is difficult to make out with certainty.


- page 5 -

The page contains the text "DON'T FORGET" at the top in large letters. The rest of the text appears to be handwritten and is mostly illegible due to the poor image quality and scanning resolution. Some words can be partially made out, but a complete transcription is not possible with the current image.

OCT 2 1967

Dear [redacted]

Vice President Humphrey has asked that I reply to your recent letter regarding the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) you observed in the vicinity of Zephyrhills, Florida.

Unfortunately, your chances of obtaining an accurate analysis of what you saw would have been much better if you had immediately reported your observation to the UFO Investigating Officer at the nearest Air Force base. However, the responsible officials in Air Force Headquarters have sent a copy of your letter to the UFO technical personnel at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, for their analysis. As soon as this is completed, they will correspond with you further.

Your interest in this subject is appreciated. Attached is a copy of the Air Force Project Blue Book report which I thought you would find interesting.

Sincerely,

Signed
