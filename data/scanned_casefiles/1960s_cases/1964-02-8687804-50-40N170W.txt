Another mystery hole

The Southampton Southern Evening
Echo on February 12 add another to
the total of mystery holes. "Bomb
disposal experts are to be called to
examine a mysterious cavity which
has suddenly appeared in a newly
ploughed field at Slackstead, near
Fareham. Two forestry workers,
taking a short cut across the field from
the work last night, saw a depression
in the ground and they reported the
discovery to the police.

Today, police officers from Ampfield and Winchester, with Mr. David
Butler, farmer and broadcaster as
guide, searched two large newly-ploughed fields for an hour before
they came across the mystery hole.
The mouth of the depression measures
about three feet at its widest, there is

neck of firm turf which, since last night,
has opened out into a large chalk
cavern.

"The police believe the cavity was
caused by a wartime bomb - there
were many dropped in the vicinity -
which exploded deep down in the
ground.

"The site of the cavity is on Mr. Butler's
estate adjoining Mr. Butler's farm.
Mr. Butler said that while the bomb
theory seemed to be the most likely
there was also the possibility that the
cavern could be associated with the
Roman occupation of the area."

between N'Gass and Zurich,
on South African Airways

SOUTH AFRICA
A pilot's sighting

This incident, briefly reported in our previous issue, can now be more fully documented. Captain R. B. Thurston, Senior Captain of South African Airways, wrote to the South African Journal of Science and his letter appeared in its March 1964 issue.

"While flying a Boeing 707 from Las Palmas to Zurich on the 15th Feb., 1964, I noticed a bright white glow in the Eastern sky at 06.11 GMT. When observed through the right-hand panel of the aircraft with shield it appeared to be about 1 nm in diameter and was periodically circular.

"The aircraft was at 37,000 ft. pressure altitude, position 32° 00'N 11° 11'W, heading 033° T.

"The co-pilot, navigator and myself watched the glow for about 10 minutes. During this time it did not appear to change its position in relation to stars which were visible in its vicinity, or in relation to the aircraft. I required the navigator to determine the altitude and azimuth of the glow by means of the periscopic sextant. This was done at 06.25 GMT and found to be 09° 49' and 697° T respectively.

"Prevailing meteorological conditions were: a layer of medium cloud with tops at about 15,000 ft. Immediately below the aircraft. This layer became broken toward the African coast and the NE. There was also some cirrostratus and wisps of cirrus to the NE. The aircraft itself was well above all cloud. Ambient air temperature -64° C.

"From the height at which we were flying, the Eastern sky was becoming lighter prior to sunrise, and the glow began to assume an elliptical shape with the long axis horizontal. The position of the glow was now altering in relation to sun and the aircraft, and we appeared to be drawing a beam of it, but its altitude appeared to remain the same to the naked eye.

"As the Eastern sky became bright, the glow appeared to increase gradually in size, the Southernmost end of the now larger ellipse diluting and splaying out and finally disappearing just before the sun appeared above the horizon.

"From first observation the glow appeared to be in a space, later a fairly rapid change in position in relation to the aircraft indicated that it was moving.

"Along with the rest of my crew at the time, I should be most interested to hear an explanation of the phenomenon."

Rabual, New Britain
19 February 1964

Mysterious Light
Haunts Couple

There seems to be at least two kinds
of aerial maneuvering light—one completely unexplainable from a physical
point of view, and the small maneuvering, possibly remote-controlled "observer" light. We deal with the former in
this account:

John Hoban, 21, a headmaster and
his wife, Donna, 19, have reported their
eerie experiences with a glowing, "ghostly" light which appeared mysteriously
in the bedroom of their home in Rabual,
New Britain. In an interview with a reporter of THE Evening Post of Auckland,
New Zealand, Mr. Hoban said that the
house was too far from the road for
car headlights to have shone through a
window. He checked and found no way
the light could have entered.

Mrs. Hoban said that the light, "a
globe of light without any center" shone
at intervals in their room between the
hours of 1 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. on February 19, 1964. Mrs. Hoban said she felt
a "strange presence" in the room, then
opened her eyes and there was the globe
of light hovering just above her face.
She looked around and instead of one
doorway from the room onto the veranda
she saw what appeared to be three
doors. She screamed, jumped from the
bed and woke her husband who was
sleeping in another bed a few feet
away. Hoban said his scalp tingled and
his hair stood on end. "I was very frightened for a moment in the face of the
thing," he said.

No mention was made in this lone
article about how or when the object
left the room or the premises. We
would like to point out, however, that in
the 1920s a Doctor doing research on
what happens, physically, when a person
dies, found that at the instant of death
(utilizing extremely sensitive scales and
special camera equipment) the body of
the dying individual loses a certain
amount of weight—less than an ounce—
and that a small luminous globe-shaped
object emanates from the head, waiting
upward and "through" the ceiling.

We present the above mentioned article and latter comment, in answer to
repeated requests from various members to try to delineate between the
physical and physical airborn light
phenomena.

Kent Mystery
Strange animals continue to appear
in England. On February 20, the
London Daily Telegraph and many

other newspapers reported that a
tiger was believed to be at large in
Norfolk on the previous evening.
Three people had informed the police
that they had seen the animal on a
railway embankment at East Runton
in the Cromer area. Thirty police
dogs were employed in the search and
the police appealed on television for
further information. The witnesses
were all guaranteed to be sane and
rational. Later, the search was
called off and the usual attempt at a
rationalisation was offered. It must
have been a fox, despite the original
description which included a tiger, a
puma, a lion and a cheetah.

Readers who think it is possible that
these strange and evanescent animals
may have some connection with flying
saucers may like to refer to the South
African occurrence reported on page
27 of our May-June issue. The
first indication the two motorists
received that something was
about was the appearance of a
large animal lying across the road.
This was soon followed by the appear-
ance of a saucer which made several
dives at the car. Could it be that
these animals are released by UFOs
as a means of testing our atmosphere
and living conditions? If so, the
passes made at the car could be ex-
plained as a diversion intended to
protect the animal whose recovery
was important to the saucer pilots. It
must be remembered that our first
space travellers were dogs and

Cape Mendocino, California
5 February 1964

Object Sinks Yacht

The yacht, "Battle D"— converted Navy search and rescue craft, was struck and sunk on Wednesday, 5 February, 1964 by an unknown object about 25 miles off the rugged coast of Cape Mendocino, California. A Coast Guard helicopter, dipping between 30-foot-high waves, pulled a German shepherd puppy, nine crewmen, the Captain and his wife from the pitching deck of the yacht.

The "Battle D" set out from Seattle on January 24, then after various stops, left Neah Bay, Washington on February 1 for California.

All eleven survivors insisted the yacht struck or was rammed by a "metal object." "I don't care how deep it was," said crewman Carl Jensen, "what held us was steel and a long piece." There was no give to it at all." Jensen was referring to the 7,800 feet depth at the point where the sinking occurred.

We include this incident because it correlates with official and unofficial sightings of UFO in the ocean in recent years.

SILVERY UFO INVADES NORTH CAROLINA

Albemarle, North Carolina, February 7 - Joe L. Burris, Ted Bowers, and, Grover and Richard Hinson, were reportedly witness to a gigantic silvery object at 5:04 p.m., which first appeared in the northwest.

The UFO was described as being approximately twice the size of a B-52. Its end portions were a dull silver, and its midsection reflected sunlight to the intensity of a mirror. A smaller object came into view following the disappearance of the larger craft.

No details have yet been secured concerning the first UFO's smaller brethren.

SCOTLAND
Dundee UFO

The following letters are taken from
the Dundee Courier on February 10 and
13, respectively. The first reads as
follows: "Dear Sir,—About two weeks
ago I observed what appeared to be a
reddish object in the sky over the
Sidlaws, moving slowly westwards
towards Perth. At first I thought little
of it, but have since made four
similar observations between January
26 and last night, February 6. On
this occasion I was accompanied by a
friend who was equally puzzled by

this phenomenon.
"On each occasion only one such
light was visible of a reddish nature.
They appear at about 8.30 p.m. and
stay visible for periods of between two
and ten minutes, then slowly fade.
For only possible explanation I can
think of is that they beat some concrete of a latest American
satellite seen lately over Dundee. But
since I have found it impossible to
tell the height and speed of the object,
I cannot say whether this is correct
or not.

"Can a more plausible explanation
be suggested? —Yours faithfully,
Meigle.
This letter brought the following reply:
"Dear Sir,—I read with great
'Puzzled' letter in Monday's
Courier. Last Thursday (February 6)
night, while walking the dog, I saw a
strange reddish object travelling very
fast towards the west.

"However, unlike the 'puzzled' I do
not think this object was an American
satellite since, when the first Russian
sputnik was launched, I could often
see its flight through the heavens and
this object was in no way similar. I
have therefore concluded that this
object must have been a falling star or
some such other natural happening.—
Yours faithfully,
Blairgowrie.
