September 21, 1962

Bo, what it the concern?
Dear sir:
Please forward this to some proper authority. You may have the original for what it's worth.
I have seen a "flying saucer" or some other unidentified flying object. I know it wasn't a satellite because it was going much slower than a satellite. I have talked to others and the general consensus is that the object was between 50 and 60 degrees higher in the sky northeast of town (Fairfield, Iowa). I was walking from East-south-east to Southwest fairly fast like a fast jet plane. It was dark enough so that I could see where I was walking - I covered about 1/3 mile in about 30 seconds. It disappeared from East-south-east to Southwest fairly fast like a jet plane. I thought it was going fast enough to have turned 90 degrees and went straight up on the way to get a ground speed of about 600 miles per hour. But I couldn't be sure it turned 90 degrees - the weather was clear not a cloud in the sky.
So I don't know exactly what it was or how fast it went, but it sure surprised me. I thought at first I looked at my watch and it was 6:45 p.m.
Please accept this and do a citizen a duty.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document containing questions and answers related to a UFO sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

A CIGAR SHAPED PLANE ALL WHITE IN COLOR VERY BRIGHT THAT IT WAS LIT UP LIKE AN AFTER THE SUN REFLECTION ON THE COCKPIT AREA AFTER THE TAIL THERE WAS A BALL OF LIGHT STILL THERE.

The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch is a curved line with the instructions to "Place on 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second sketch appears to be a landscape scene with a person walking down a road, with various buildings or structures in the background. The third sketch is a smaller landscape illustration showing a horizon line with hills or mountains in the distance.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, Imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch places an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
