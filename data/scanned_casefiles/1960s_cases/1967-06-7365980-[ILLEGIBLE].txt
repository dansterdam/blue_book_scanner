1. Reference your recent observations of an unidentified flying
object. There are a few points that need to be clarified before
reach our final conclusion. We have two completed FTD Forms 164
from you which appear to describe the same sighting. One form states
that you observed the UFO on June 6, 1967, yet on the other form you
state that the sighting occurred on June 27, 1967. Has there actually
two sightings on different dates or just one sighting? If there was
just one sighting, would you indicate the correct date.

2. In your letter of June 11, you indicated that the large UFO was
hovering in the direction of Dupon, Pennsylvania. According to our
maps, Dupont is east of Pittston, yet in your letter you stated that
the UFO was in the northwestern part of the sky. We would like to
clarify the direction in which the UFO was observed.

3. We would appreciate a note from you clarifying the above discrepancies.

Dear Sirs,

Forgive me for sending this to you because I did not know where else to send it.

My name is [redacted], age 44, and I am a resident of Bristol, Conn.

There is probably some reasonable explanation for my observation that I thought my sight of a UFO should be reported.

On the early morning of July 5 at 2:30 A.M. I was camping with my cousin [redacted] and two of his friends, all residents of Bristol, Spring, PA. Our campsite was situated near this area. All there. It was a clear night and cold (it got down to 47° F that night). Overhead...

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I'm sorry to cause you any trouble.

On the problem about the date (?) I did see the triangular shaped object on June 27, 1967.

I might have a mistake on the date of another object. I am fairly certain it was June 6, 1967, I saw a gold object. It moved forward direction (~) moved up(?) and disappeared.

Else U.F.O.
I have goofed the direction. It was east
of Peyton.

Sincerely,
Mr.

Dear Major Doctor Quintanilla:

I saw 2 U.I.F.O.'s June 6,1967 at 11:33 P.M. over Dupont, Pennsylvania. I saw them from Pittston, PA.

B= The bigger one was: a triangular shaped object, which had a black spot in its center and red blinking lights on the 3 sides and watched it for about 5 minutes. It also had a lighted tail like a kite. It was hovering over a large tree. (There were 2 figures under it, on the ground).

S= The smaller object was: an all red, triangular shaped, and fiery. It was hovering alone a tree about 4-5 miles from the bigger one. Then, it raced toward the bigger U.F.O. with fantastic speed. The bigger one disappeared when the smaller one ran into it.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]

Dear Sirs:

On the night of June 27, 1967 I saw a U.F.O. over Dupont, Pennsylvania. It was a triangular-shaped object, which had a black spot in its center, and red blinking light on the sides at 11:31 P.M. and watched it for 5 minutes. It had a lighted tail, like a kite. It disappeared after a similar object ran into it. The smaller object was a red-fiery color, hovering about half a mile away from the bigger U.F.O. The bigger U.F.O. hovered about a tree for a few minutes at a very slow speed. Then, the smaller U.F.O. raced toward the bigger one at a fantastic speed until it ran into

I spotted the object. Its outline was
not visible only four lights, two
red and two yellow. There was a
bluish-white flame shooting from
the rear. Its height could not be
determined. It went across the sky
from east to west at a very high
speed. There was a sonic boom.
It disappeared at about 2:35 A.M.

Most of the text in the "Brief Summary and Analysis" section and other sections is illegible due to poor image quality or blurring.

At the bottom of the form, there is a partially visible note that seems to say "Previous edition of this form may be used."

The rest of the document appears to be a standard form with sections like "Conclusion", "Type of Observation", "Physical Evidence", etc., but the details within these sections are not clearly readable.

AIRCRAFT

Memo for the Record:

Letter was sent to the witness to clarify several points in his sighting. Witness wrote back explaining that the sighting involving a kite shaped object with red lights was only seen on 27 June 1967. When he contacted a 16h he had put down the date 6 June 1967 as the date. Additional information revealed that only 27 June 1967 was the date of the sighting. Additional information also helped to clarify the actual direction in which the object was seen. The witness now says the object was in the eastern sky.

It is interesting to note that the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Airport is east of the sighting area. At this last it would be impossible to determine if any aircraft activity was responsible for the sighting. Possibly some type of aircraft activity could have accounted for the sighting.
