14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes - it disappeared by going very fast

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:
The object disappeared behind a small cloud

(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:
The object reappeared from behind a small cloud, moving at a fast speed

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
If it extended to about a 1/2 of an inch of the match from my perspective

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically tell if it was hovering, moving, etc. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The object was circular in shape, with a bright white glow, moving at a fast speed from left to right across the sky. It disappeared behind a small cloud before reappearing, continuing its fast motion.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was hovering very low, just treetop level, over a farm field. it seemed to be doing nothing other than hovering low with no visible means of propulsion. The craft was disk shaped and completely silent. We watched it for over 10 minutes before it suddenly acceleratied straight up and out of sight at tremendous speed. None of the other usual aircraft noises or signs were present. Only a few lights were visible on the craft, and those remained steady throughout the sighting. It was a very unsettling experience as the craft seemed to defy normal physical laws. I still cannot adequately explain what I saw that night.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report about an unusual phenomena sighting over Washington, D.C. on December 12, 1963. The text provides details about the sighting, including that the observer stated they had seen an unusual phenomena in the skies over Washington that evening, and that the observer indicated the phenomena did not appear to be a flock of starlings or birds.

Report of Unusual Phenomena Sighting over Washington, D.C., 11 and 12 December 1963.

Reference sighting #14 in the AF Fact Sheet, this article describes a sighting call from a member of the Netherlands Embassy who stated that he had read the text sheet and this item was of particular interest to him.

He further advised that he had seen just such an unusual phenomena in the skies over Washington on several occasions and that in each case it developed into a flock of starlings. This would conclude with the phenomenon disappearing. He would conclude with the two officers who stated that the phenomena did not appear solid and that the size and shape changes continued.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the motion of an unidentified object or objects. The sketch includes a compass and instructions for the observer to draw the path and direction of the object's motion. There is also a note at the bottom indicating "SEE 28 ABOVE", suggesting this image is related to a previous page or entry.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where the object was when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ____2____
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a report received by Captain Quintanilla, who is said to be from the Netherlands Embassy, regarding a UFO sighting over Washington, DC in 1963. The document mentions that the reported phenomena was a "flight of starlings (or which there are millions in this area), most often being chased by a bird of prey."

April 13, 1954

Captain Quintanilla: 
Major Jacks this morning, upon receipt of a UFO Fact Sheet sent to him some time ago. He said that in reading over the 1963 cases, #14 regarding the phenomena observed over Washington, was of particular interest to him. He said that he had seen this same type of phenomena on several occasions. What it was (he reported) was a flight of starlings (or which there are millions in this area), most often being chased by a bird of prey.

There is no photograph present in this scanned document from the Project Blue Book files. The image shows an official letter dated February 13, 1954, addressed to a Colonel and written by Major Maston M. Jacks of the Office of Information, United States Air Force.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Colonel:

Reference telephone conversation of February 10th, the Air Force has been unable to make any evaluation of the object viewed on February 20th.

Since the object viewed was apparently over the National Airport during a period of heavy air traffic and no reports were made from aircraft or tower personnel, it is believed that you observed some natural phenomena. However, there is no evidence to support any conclusion as to the cause of this observed condition.

Sincerely,

Dear Commander,

This air evaluation of the observation which you and Mr. [redacted] reported having seen in the vicinity of the 14th Street Bridge on or about December 12, 1963.

Since the object viewed was apparently in the vicinity of a military air traffic and no reports were made from aircraft or towers personnel nor from any other persons in the vicinity of the bridge on that date, it is believed that you observed some natural phenomena which was not identified as to the cause of the observation.
