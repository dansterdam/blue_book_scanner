[Handwritten text begins]
I am quite positive that the object concerned was moving, because in the course of moving, on the slant trajectory - stop and go like object was blotted from my view - by trees or distance, but could then I could step when my view was clear. I could see at its the plane I have dimly lost sight of just for good while I had the same left side direction most others pointing that object behind me.

By did not appear to be anything solid - it was looked more nearly like a black gas. Only once did it condense into a relatively small body and out at that time it looked as natural place color and did seem to be solid. In fact, though I am particularly inclined to this, what it was in the shape I saw it could well be a flight the light from the grayish movement sky

Report of Unusual Phenomena Sighting over Washington, D.C. 11 and 12 December 1963

Reference sighting #14 in the AF Fact Sheet, this office received a telephone call from a member of the Netherlands Embassy who stated that he had read the Fact Sheet and this item was of particular interest to him.

He further advised that he had seen just such an unusual phenomena in the skies over Washington on several occasions, and that in each case it developed that the phenomena was a flock of starlings being chased by a bird of prey. This would coincide with the description of the observation by the two observers who stated that the phenomena did not appear solid and that the size and shape changed continually.

Captain Quintanilla:

Mr. [redacted] of the Netherlands Embassy called Major Jacks this morning, upon receipt of a UFO Fact Sheet sent to him some time ago. He said that in reading over the 1963 cases, #14 regarding the phenomena observed over Washington, was of particular interest to him. He said that he had seen this same type [redacted] of phenomena on several occasions. What it was (he reported) was a flight of starlings (of which there are millions in this area), most often being chased by a bird of prey.

February 13, 1964

Dear Colonel:

Reference telephone conversation of February 10th, the Air Force has been unable to make any evaluation of the sighting, you report.

Since the object viewed was apparently over National Airport during a period of heavy air traffic and no reports were made from aircraft or tower personnel, it is believed that you observed some mutual phenomena. However, there is no evidence to support any conclusion as to the cause of the observation.

Dear Commander

The Air Force has been unable to make any evaluation of the observation which you and Mrs. reported having seen in the vicinity of the 14th Street bridge on or about December 12, 1953.

Since the object viewed was apparently in the vicinity of National Airport during a period of heavy air traffic, and no reports were made from aircraft or tower personnel nor from any other persons in the vicinity of the bridge on that date, it is believed that you observed some natural phenomena. However, there is no evidence to support any conclusion as to the cause of the observation.
