Probable: AIRCRAFT

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Sighting: Two 18 yr old boys saw light near the ground coming toward them. When nearly overhead they stated it was 150 ft above them and the "size of a cottage" and rectangular. The observers reportedly chased the object to 96mph at an angle 12 ft away.

COMMENTS: Both boys were requested to complete an AF Form 117 but neither has done so as of 4 Mar 69. Although the boys stated they reported the sighted to the Police, the Omaha Police dept. stated that they had not received any reports on this date, and that none of the officers on duty that night saw anything either.

The boys had just been talking about space ships and things of that nature. When they sighted the object. About 3 days to a week later the observers reportedly sighted the same object again in same area and traveling in the same direction. There are several airfields SE of the observers location and the lighting conditions of this "MUFO" is very similar to that of an aircraft.

Here is the text from the document:

No common object could be thought of that was similar. It appeared to look like two pontoons joined by a front section. It was slightly longer than it was wide.

Did you notice any sound, noise or heat emanating from the phenomenon or any effect on yourself, animals or machinery in the vicinity? [X] NO.

Did the phenomenon disturb the ground or leave any physical evidence? [X] NO.

I interviewed both boys separately. I allowed each to tell his story in his own words. The stories were basically the same. I asked the same questions of both boys and their answers were the same.

On Thursday night, 11 July 68 at 1230 CDST, the two boys were out on a country road near Harm's Auto Junk yard. They were looking across the fields towards a Roberts dairy farm building approximately one mile away. In the area between their position and the farm building is a valley. A hill obscures the valley from view from the position of the two boys.

Suddenly, the object appeared rising from the valley and was in sight as it rose above the hill line. They do not remember if it was rising vertically only or if it had any discernible forward movement at that time. After rolling approximately fifteen feet or all the way over the hill line, it became illuminated by three white lights in the front and two green lights on the rear. I asked them if the lights could have possibly been on all the time just then not noticed then. They feel that the object was dark until that time and then appeared to turn on the lights.

It continued to climb until it was high enough to be above the horizon. No ground disturbance, noise, or smell was detected. The object appeared to level off at about 200 feet above the ground after traveling approximately 1000 feet in a northeasterly direction. It then made its only turn, turning right to a southeasterly direction. It flew towards the viewers and passed by them approximately 500 feet to their right. At this time they pursued it in their car. A 1953 Ford sedan. They were able to maintain a position approximately one half mile behind the object while traveling 80 to 90 miles per hour.

After approximately three minutes it accelerated rapidly and did not appear to gain any altitude. It rapidly disappeared in the distance south of the city of Omaha.

The boys returned on Saturday night in hopes of seeing the object again but it was not seen. The boys were 18 years old and appeared to be very reasonable. They seemed to be sincere and quite positive in all their responses to my questions.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                   13 July 1968

SUBJ: UFO Sighting, 11 July 1968

I called Offutt AFB to talk to Capt Cunningham but he was not in so
I talked to Sgt McCoy. I asked him to tell Capt Cunningham to find
out if any aircraft had landed at Offutt or Omaha City Airport
at approximately 12:35am. Also, if the city police had received any
calls about a UFO at that time or if Offutt Tower had anything
unusual in the log that night, and if anything unidentified was
tracked on radar.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 11 July 1968

TO:     FID (DESTR-Lt Morano)

1. No known aircraft were flying in the area at the time of the sighting. Offutt AFB had only one aircraft landing close to the time. An EC-135 aircraft landed at Offutt at 0031 CDT on runway 30. By landing on runway 30 this would mean that the aircraft approached Offutt from the east and would not have been anywhere near the area of the sighting. The sighting was to the west of Offutt AFB approximately 16 miles. There were no aircraft departing Offutt during this time frame.

2. There are only two airports in the vicinity of the sighting, the Millard Municipal and the South Omaha. Neither of these airports are very close. The closest one is at Millard. It is approximately seven miles southeast of the position of the sightings.

3. I visited the Millard airport and no one there had been anything unusual or had heard of anything unusual. There were no unusual design aircraft there. There are no homemade or experimental aircraft present at the airport. All aircraft were of the usual light aircraft style, both high wing and low wing. The same results were obtained at the other airport.

4. I contacted the Omaha Radar Approach Control Facility and spoke with Mr. Elmer Carsten, the manager. He questioned all the radar controllers on duty that night and no unidentified targets were noted.

July 2, 1968                                                                July 12, 1968

Since I was in the army, I'll have to rely on you.

I don't remember what the date was.
What time of the day was it?
Well it was about, I think, about 12:00 at night, and it was about, approximately, 140th and Dodge. You probably don't know where that is.

No I don't, but what is important is what the neighborhood is like.
It was out in the country. There's a junk yard right close there too.
Were you and Jim in the same yard at the time?
No, we were coming down Dodge street, at about 150th and Dodge, and
I'm located out in this field. Well, we'd been parking, taking
about space ships and things of this sort, you know, and then we
saw "Look down, in that field." It looks like, you know, or something,
and then we said "It looks like a big light in that field there."

This was night-time then? W. Right. About what time? W. About 12:00.
Then you're coming down, and you were driving...
No, we was driving.
...and the windows were closed?
No, I rolled my window down to look at it.
So first it looked light. A street light that was on the ground, sort of.
right. It was kind of a... well I couldn't really tell, because he
still was slowing a little bit, sort of, and I couldn't tell if the
thing was on the ground or moving above. We and so we approached
it closer, and we got out of the car and looked down in this field,
and then it was up in the air then. And it started coming toward us, and it wasn't making any noise, and the size of it was kind
of like a small cottage or a house. It was approximately, or I don't
know, about 50' by about 175'. Kind of a rectangular shape.
The thing itself has a rectangular shape and not oval. It had sharp
corners than.
Yes, and it was approximately 100' above us.
How could you judge tract? Did it pass in front of anything?
Yeah, there were some telephone poles that were above us, that were
close by, and it was very, very close. I mean we weren't seeing things.
We could tell that.
Well if there were some telephone poles close by, or a house, it
would tell you roughly how far away it was.
Well there were some telephone poles close by, and they were
possibly, Oh, thirty feet. You could judge by that. It went
directly over us.
Was the sky clear or cloudy?
Oh, I think it was clear. Yeah, it was clear.
Was the moon out?
I don't think that it was. But I remember that it was a clear night,
so it must have been.
Well, it's not out every night. Let's go back to the light. When
did it seem to change from a light to an object?
Well, when we approached closer. From where we were when we first
saw it, we thought it was just a big light.
And what was the color of that light?
White.
How bright did it seem?
About like a car light.
About how far away? What would you compare it to?
Well I'll just give you this comparison. When it passed over us it
had a number of, like, car lights in front of it. It was kind of


- page 17 -

Here is the text from the document:

Call                 Omaha                 July 12, 1965

projecting out like it was a car in the area and it had two lights
fixed as such.

What did you and Jim think about it at the time? Were you frightened or
interested or what?
Well, very interested, really.
What did you think it was, at first?
Oh I thought it might have been a really did think that it might have
been some kind of flying object, or it might have been something
of the Air Force, something experimental of the Air Force.
"Wasn't it making any noise at all?"
No.
Were there any noises around you at the time?
No, none whatsoever.
Completely silent, then.
Uh-hmm.
So far as you're concerned it would completely rule out any
aircraft?
Right.

How many people did you tell about this?
Well first of all, as we say it was going at a southeast angle across
this field, and so we went back into Judge Street, which we saw it
was going to pass over. So we were trying to chase it down Dodge,
and we were going approximately 90 miles an hour down Dodge Street,
trying to keep up with it, but it just kept angling across this field
and it seemed to give us speed. After a while until it got
Did it change color as it was moving?
No it didn't.
Only one light or more?
The lights were in the front like car lights, and then there were
some green lights underneath and it was kind of lit up underneath,
as if it kind of had red pontoons on the bottom, or something, and we
got to this phone booth, and we called up the police, because that
was the only number that I knew right away, and told them about it.
They said that they would notify SAC Air Force Base of our airstrips.
Well, that's how we got hold of it. Most likely, No, about the
shape and the contrast. Was the light so bright that it was hard
to make out the shape?
Well, it wasn't real easy to make out the shape, because it was
above us, you know, just directly over us, and we could more or less
just see the bottom. And then as it passed by, the top part of it
wasn't lit up. And therefore we could just kind of make an outline.
Were you conscious, as it passed over, that it actually looked
out the light of stars, or was it transparent at all?
No, it blocked out.
How long did this whole thing last? By the way, when you first
saw it, what direction were you looking?
We were looking into the west, or rather the northwest.
Are there trees or houses in that direction?
There are trees along this highway, there's somewhat and it would be
set off for a while, and then there's some slopes and it would be
off off, and then as you traveled along there would be slopes with
trees and then you could see it, and after a while there was a dirt
road, and we then took off, probably just a matter of minutes.
How now long was it stationary on the ground after you saw it?
From the time we first saw it still the time we got to the junk yard
where it took off, probably just a matter of minutes.

Omaha                                                      July 12, 1968

How many minutes or seconds?
Well it was actually stationary there for several minutes.

How far away from the junk yard were you when you first saw it?
Oh, possibly... maybe a half mile.

Where did you park the car?
Right into the junk yard parking area.

Could you estimate the distance?
Well there's a mile field down behind the junk yard a ways, and it wasn't sitting in the junk yard, it was sitting down in open fields.

How far away was that open field?
I'd say approximately two blocks.

Did you feel you could get closer to it, or was this as close as you could get?
Well, when we first got there, we just got out in utter amazement to look at it, then as we were viewing it, we didn't have time to anything to do look at it, because then it started moving, toward us.

Did it rise up first or did it come directly at you?
It rose up first.

Straight up or at an angle?
I'd say straight up.

Did it take long to go straight up?
Well it rose very slowly, really. It wasn't on the ground, it was off the ground somewhere.....and I don't believe that it did rise up at we got there.

Did you examine the ground there later, for marks?
Well we went out with some Air Force patrolman, and we didn't observe it ourselves, but it's kind of hard to get to. It's down through some brush, and some trees and were some stuff. They said they would investigate.

I don't think they found any marks. Let's pretend you have just got to the junk yard and are reliving the experience. When I say so, pretend you are watching the object or light and when I say "Now!" Okay, start...............

25 seconds, but probably it seemed like a lot more to you at that time. Describe its motions, were they jerky, wobbly or smooth?
They were smooth.

And when it rose up straight, did it stop and then come toward you
or did it sort of curve around?
Well I don't really recall that. Even rose. When we approached it, it was just above this field. It might have angled up somewhat when it came toward us. It is on some slope where it was hovering.
So what you think now is that it was moving to begin with and just came toward you. (W. Right) R...... In what direction was it?
In a southeasterly direction.

How much longer did you see it?
Well it appeared to be going very slowly, and it seemed to pick up speed as it went along, but I can't say definitely because it was going at an angle across fields, you know. But it just seemed to range from the same area. After it was traveling for a while, it just kept on going in the same direction at about the same height.

[The entire text appears to be a transcript of an interview or statement, with questions and answers. The text is quite long and detailed, discussing some kind of sighting or chase involving an unidentified object. Due to the length, I'll provide the full text as seen:]

and then what did you do?
I went down Dodge to try to see it again, but it had already
went down Dodge past Boise, and then we were in the car again.
You didn't see it after you got in the car again.
Oh yes. We watchsqt, and it kept on angling across in a southeast-
erly direction.

Dodge Street runs what? (W. Right) But it kept angling off
so you want east on Dodge St. (W. Right) But it was going to go what
to the southeast. (W. Right) And it was then you got up to about
two or three miles from here we had seen it. I mean, where
was covering about two or three miles from where we had first seen
ever so up?
No, it just seemed to disappear in the distance.
How many minutes would you say the whole thing took?
Between ten and fifteen minutes. I'd say. Still it was completely
out of sight.
Was most of that time spent in chasing it? (pause) It was
Maybe just a little bit over half the time was chasing it.
Did I mention that we thought we saw one on another?
No. Tell me about that.
One other night we were out in the country. This kid and I.....
Was it also Jan?
Yes. And this time we didn't get very close. This time we just
sort of chased it off. we had didn't get close enough to see
well do you think it was the same thing or something different?
It wasn't no airplane. I'm sure of that. I was the same object.
And it came - this time - were south of Dodge, approximately
two or three miles from here we had seen it. the first time, where
was covering, say two or three miles from where we first saw it in
direction, a southeasterly angle and about the same angle and it
seemed to be going a bit, seemingly faster this time.
How much later was that?
I think it was three days to a week later.
What makes you think it was the same things?
Motion and weight, the motion on it. I mean...it wasn't no airplane,
we could very well distinguish that.
How close were you this time?
Maybe within about four blocks.
Did you ask if anyone else had seen it?
No, but the Air Force did.
Did the police get any other calls, do you know?
No.
Was it written up in the newspaper at all?
I don't believe it was.
When you told your friends about this, what did they think?
Most of them kind of just laughed, whereas some of them - I didn't
want believe in them. Most of them don't believe in them. I didn't
believe in them myself. It's just that I know that I wasn't seeing
things. I've read about these people that have seen things - masses
in the strike cloud formations and things such as this.
was right over here.
You had a witness also, so it would be hard to say that you were
both seeing things. If you could put something in the air, what
would you put it? Well I would say, well something in the line of
well something in the line of, maybe a small cabin, not too large.

Page 5

That light, underneath, was a slow or delicate light, I seemed to see glow, like it reflected off of something, and it also seemed to have pontoons on the bottom of it.

From lights underneath, what color were they?
They were white. And I wouldn't say that a light was underneath, I just say it was a reflection.

Could it have been that the pontoons were reflecting the white light in the front?
Very possible.

Did it look to you as if it at the nave come from outer space?
Yes I really did think so. And I thought, you know, after hearing the Air Force say that they had nothing to see of this type, you know, experience.

When did the Air Force come out to see you?
Between a week and two weeks later.

That's the Offutt Air Force Base there? (Y. Yes) And how did they treat you? Reasonably well, or were they skeptical?
Well they seemed to believe me, what we told them, but then they don't really believe in such objects as they are, because they've had very limited report on those things and they've proven that about 95% of them are things other than flying objects. I think there's a very small percentage that haven't been identified. But this gentleman himself said that he really didn't believe in them, but he said that he did believe my story.

Well that's good.....Well it's quite true that many of them are ex pilots but then there are a number that are unqualified and those are the ones we're interested in from a scientific standpoint.

Did he have any different ideas about this? Did he see it pioneer or something?
No, about the same time that I did, except that when he spotted it in the field, he noticed it first. Immediately when he spotted it, he told me.

Do you remember what he first said?
Well I believe that he said "Look out in that field" and then "There's a space-ship out there." "Something along this line." And I kind of chuckled to myself and then I looked out there, you know, and I - it looked like some big light in the field, like, you know, like just a street light in the field, is what it looked like from the distance that we were. Now that I look back, it's impossible that we really could see that and believe that.

Is the field completely barren, or does it have things in it?
No there are crops growing in it, some type of - no type of something. It wasn't corn or any thing like that.

Could there have been anyone out there with a tractor light?
No. There's a Roberts Dairy right close by, I presume.

Do you think you could get hold of a city map and draw in where you were and what direction the thing was and go on.
O.K. I guess I could.

I'd suggest that, anything else that you think I should know?
Like me to have me going to call me tonight, and would you like me to have some way?
Well yes, he could call me collect if he'd like to.
I'm almost sure I could have him call that. Well that would be fine. Where is he stationed?
Well thanks very much, etc.

Reference: Your letter of 14 February
To:       Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases requested. I regret that some of these cases are being sent to you unduly late. Reorganization of my office and files should prevent this in the future.

2. I regret also, from your standpoint, that all four cases must in my opinion be evaluated as unidentified.

3. I would rate the 12 July 1968, Omaha, Nebraska, case as the weakest in this category and the one at Cochran, Wisconsin, the strongest. I obtained a good tape recording in the Cochran case, and will send you a copy of the transcript as soon as my secretary can accomplish this. I obtained an additional report phone conversation from Mr. Mark of Jefferson City, because I needed to clear up several points, particularly the matter of the sighting possibly being caused by the launching of a new satellite. I will send that transcript also if you should wish it.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
5 - 10 minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS Two 18-year old boys, called respon-
sible by Interrogating office (concurred in by Hynek through
phone call) saw a light near the ground coming toward them. When
nearly overhead they started it was 150 feet above the ground and the
"size of a cottage"50'x70' and rectangular. Boys chased it up
to 90 mph but it angled away. Boys called police, police
notified SAC. Hynek's experiment with boys indicated it took
25 seconds for object to come overhead. The fact that object
seemed to have portions underneath and white lights in front
and green lights in back indicates outside possibility that
boys could have seen an aircraft and grossly misidentified it.
However, they stated it was noiseless and blocked out the light
of stars as it passed.

4. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The boys were looking across the field when the object came from the valley between two hills directly in their line of sight. After it appeared above the hill line its lights turned on. It was moving slowly from their left to their right. It then made its only turn, turning towards them and passing almost directly overhead, slightly to their right.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

The boys got back into their car and pursued the object at speeds of 80 to 90 miles per hour and appeared to be able to stay up with it for a while. The object suddenly accelerated and was out of sight in the distance rapidly. Entire period of sighting was only five minutes.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

Lights were steady, no flashing, no flickering, no noticeable change in their intensity.

The object appeared approximately the size of three hands at arms length. It was very low and appeared very large. It seemed to be as "his as a house."
