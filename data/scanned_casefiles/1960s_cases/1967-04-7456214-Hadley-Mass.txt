Dear Sir,

I am only twelve years old but what I saw April 25, just might be an unidentified flying object.

My father and I were over the neighbors talking with a nice friend. We were talking about fifteen minutes and walked home. It was getting dark and we went to put the truck away when we came out of the barn. I looked toward the mountain (which was far away and hidden by trees) and saw the red lights up the radio station. But I saw another red light just above the trees, and it was moving at a fair rate of speed. When I saw it I ran as just my feet would carry me to get the field glasses.

When I returned it was nowhere in sight and I had not even been gone for half a minute. I looked way to the right and then it was going at the same speed, but I never saw anything change a flight path so quickly and so far away from where it had been before! I looked at it through the field-glasses and it was a blurry red light with no shape. When the red light blended off the color was blue in the same place. It started to go behind some trees so I couldn't see it. I am down the hill to a better view point but it was just gone. (Turn over)

When I got back up the hill there was another light, orange in color and moving twice as slow as the first light. When it got behind the trees it disappeared too. I stayed out side for about ten minutes but I could not see them anymore. I don't know exactly what I saw but I would be grateful if you wrote back.

Thank you very much for reading this letter.

Your close friend

P.S.
Please excuse this place where the pen striped, and I forgot to tell you when it changed flight path it was about a mile away with me moved to whole time.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
