EVALUATION REPORT
Analysis of Suspected Meteorite

REPORT NR:     MAY 64-24                   DATE:   12 October 1964

I.  PURPOSE:
    Analysis of suspected meteorite for identification.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
    1. The sample was submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch
       No. 4-1591.

    2. The sample was chipped and pieces sent to X-ray diffraction for
       scattering pattern, infrared for spectrum between 2.5μ - 40μ,
       and spectrographic analysis for an emission spectrum.

       a. X-ray diffraction gave no patterns.

       b. Infrared spectrum showed no organic material present, but a
          spectrum similar to an inorganic silicate.

       c. Spectrographic analysis gave the following results:

SUBJECT: Meteorite Particle for Analysis

TO: FMDC (UDSN)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. Dr. Ernest Steinhoff, AFMDC Chief Scientist, on a recent trip to Europe picked up a small bit of material allegedly part of a larger meteorite. The object plus a translated description are forwarded with this letter.

2. In the event the object is of interest to you, request you arrange for detailed analysis and provide me with a final report. If you are not interested please return the object and inclosures, and I will turn them over to the School of Mines, Socorro, New Mexico for analysis outside of the Foreign Technology program.

TRANSLATION

[Location], 5 Sep 64

Dear Dr. Steinhoff!

In reference to our telephone conversation of 3 September 1964, please find attached hereto the promised price of meteorite stone.

It has a degree of hardness of 6-8, contains quartz, and in a pulverized state can be utilized as a safety coating against Xrays and other radiation.

I am convinced that the examination of this specimen could lead to an interesting result, especially in view of the fact that the world's best research facilities are at your disposal.

Should you have an interest in other materials, I can also make these available to you.

I personally am not in possession of these meteor stones; however, I can act as the go-between for them.

Respectfully yours,
