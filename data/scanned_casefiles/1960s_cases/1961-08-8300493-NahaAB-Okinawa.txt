10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Approx 12 objts as appear-
ing separately. Trail approx 1" long at arms
length. Increasing glow next to star. Appeared
30° elev, 200° az. Disappeared (approx 6 of
them) at 5° elev 135° az. Others 20° elev and
230° az due nearby electrical lights glow.
Flight paths were long arching curves except
for several that performed abrupt angular
changes of direction with no apparent change
in speed. Speed was tremendous.

11. COMMENTS
Description of sighting has
all characteristics of a meteor shower. It
and ends in Sep. Coordinates apparent
origin of shower 35°49 coincides with
location indicated by witness as origin
of objts. Fact that witness indicated
that objts were going away from him is due
to an optical illusion. There is no reason
to identify these objts as other than
meteors.
