LETTERS
On March 19, 1965, a letter is to me from the Dominion Observatory, Ottawa, Canada which says:

Colorado Springs informed me by telephone that I received from the Air Force and 125' south and 120' east of Edmonton, Alta., Canada and just south of the town of Donnelly, about 90 miles southwest of Edmonton, officials of the University of Alberta and other institutions were investigating the landing area of this object.

The letter goes on to provide additional details about the reported sighting, including information on the size and location of the object.

FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
CHAIRMAN: NICAP Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee
TO: NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Attention: Richard Hall
C.C.: USAF (AFX-2T)
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Gentlemen:
I enclose a LIF report which has been tentatively identified as a "huge fireball." It is sent to you "for information purposes" in the event that other data might be submitted relating it to a genuine UFO.

I am in contact with the "Moonwatch" program at Smithsonian Observatory and have received additional information from them pending their possible receipt of other reports regarding this sighting. The observer feels certain that the object was not a reflection on his automobile windshield. Although he has seen large meteors before, he never has witnessed anything as large as the object he observed last night.

Please forward a copy of this report from NICAP to Dr. Charles Clivfer, NICAP Board member.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Investigator

THIS TIME 10:25 13 OCT 1955
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. REFERENCE REPORTS MADE IN THIS CASE BY LT COL CHARLES S. HATCHER, USAF
2. INVESTIGATION OF ABOVE CASE IS COMPLETE AND THE FOLLOWING DETAILS ARE SUBMITTED:
3. ON 13 OCTOBER 1955, AT APPX 1950 HOURS, A REPORT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS RECEIVED FROM MR. STANLEY J. LARSON, 4207 S. WILKESON, TACOMA, WASHINGTON.
4. LARSON STATED THAT HE FIRST OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY OVER LARSON AFB, WASH, WHICH APPEARED TO BE MOVING ERRATICALLY. HE THEN CONTACTED THE BASE OPERATIONS OFFICE AT LARSON AFB, AND LEARNED THAT NO KNOWN AIR TRAFFIC WAS IN THE AREA.
5. IN CHECKING FURTHER, LARSON DETERMINED THAT THE OBJECT HE HAD OBSERVED WAS APPARENTLY NOT AN AIRCRAFT, BUT AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS IN DIAMETER, AND THAT IT MOVED RAPIDLY THROUGH THE SKY, MAKING SUDDEN STOPS AND STARTS, AND VERY ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION.
6. LARSON FURTHER STATED THAT HE OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, AND THAT SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS IN THE AREA ALSO OBSERVED IT. HE SAID THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT.
7. INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT BY LT COL CHARLES S. HATCHER, USAF, INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED BY MR. LARSON AND OTHERS WAS PROBABLY A WEATHER BALLOON. DUE TO THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS EXISTING AT THE TIME, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE BALLOON WOULD HAVE EXHIBITED THE CHARACTERISTICS DESCRIBED BY MR. LARSON.
8. IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS, THIS CASE IS CONSIDERED CLOSED.

MEMOS...
To whom it may concern:
Due to conflicting reports coming in from the public regarding the sightings of unidentified flying objects, I note that Washington has put out a release stating that the Air Force is no longer investigating these sightings. However, I must tell you that the day will come soon when the Agency behind the UFO investigation as I know it will reveal itself and we, the public, will be astonished at what they find.

Professor Reports E-M Phenomena

A University professor in Victoria, B.C. informs us that he was awakened Sunday, 7 March, by a strange noise. He turned on the lights and went outside to investigate. He saw an unidentified flying object hovering over his house for about 2 or 3 minutes. The object was silent, oval-shaped, and had reddish-orange lights on the side. It made no sound and eventually moved off to the northeast. 

The professor then drove down to Victoria from Swartz Bay as usual when, on the last 100 yards of his drive, his car engine and lights failed. The engine restarted normally as he approached his home in the country, all of his electrical systems having returned to normal operation.

The next day he took his car in for a check-up and the mechanic found nothing wrong. The professor later learned from his Civil Defense monitor who alerted him to the UFO sighting that a similar incident of engine and light failure had been reported in Victoria that night.

The document states that these phenomena might be considered unrelated incidents and possibly they are - but they have been observed in conjunction with UFO sightings previously, so the incidents are included in this report.

Deputy Sheriffs ridiculed
On three occasions in March, high-ranking UFO officers observed and tried to report unusual objects in the sky, but were ridiculed by Napa County deputies William Bishop, John Robertson, James Stubbe, and Stubbe's son.
The UFO's observed on March 14, 15, and 15, were made by Bishop and Robertsontold them the object changed from a dark object to a dim light, and then disappeared. 
Police officers who saw the object chanced from a dim light to a dark object and felt the UFO displayed the capability of hovering, sudden stops, and departures at high speed. The deputies derided the observers, saying "The UFO was a Navy observation balloon with batteries to make it glow."
The account says that the witnesses could clearly see that the object was not a balloon, and dismissed the deputy's explanation. Free balloons drift with the wind, and the witnesses said the object they observed showed directed flight and maneuvers not characteristic of a balloon.
No wonder that disbelief in the official "answers" is steadily growing.

Air Force Satellite 
Launched in California

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - The Air Force launched a new satellite here Monday at 5:43 a.m. PST. The one-line Air Force satellite, carrying a scientific experiment, was boosted into an orbit of more than 17,000 miles by a Thor-Agena rocket combination from this Pacific Missile Range.

The Thor-Agena project was developed as a flexible satellite launching system capable of placing payloads of more than 500 pounds in orbit. The satellite launched Monday weighs less than 75 pounds.

The object emitted a loud whirring noise and had four bright beams of light emanating from it in a clockwise motion. After observing the object for 15 minutes, he was approached by a ground force. When he raised consciousness, the UFO was gone, though a reddish glow remained on the ground where the UFO had been. He called the sheriff's office who investigated and later confirmed his story. The Air Force contacted him and obtained information regarding the incident. Both were wary because of injuries received during the UFO encounter. CASE LOSS. Washington, D.C.

Washington 25, D.C.

Gentlemen:

On December 19, 1964, at 3:30 A.M., two Central Tower Operators on duty in the tower at Larson Air Force Base, Washington, observed on radar unidentified objects moving at a speed in excess of 7000 miles per hour. At one point, the objects approached a point only 10 miles from the tower. The nearest aircraft was 90 miles away. The UFOs were real solid objects. What is the Air Force conclusion for this report?

On December 21, 1964, at about 6 P.M., a man by the name of Horace Burns reported observing the landing of a UFO while driving on Route 250 near Dayton, Virginia. In the object, he could see two men, described as wearing shiny suits, with a blue fluorescent band around the base. After a minute, the UFO rose up with a slight hissing sound. A similar report was previously received on December 14, 1964.

On March 14, 1965, between 1 - 2 A.M., a man by the name of James Flynn reported observing a UFO in the Florida Everglades. The UFO was shaped like a "sharp-edged disc" and descended with a whirling motion. The object approached within 150 feet and the witness felt dizzy and was knocked unconscious. He had to be hospitalized with eye damage. That is the Air Force conclusion for this report.

Thank you very much for your cooperation in informing of the conclusions of the above reports.

Sincerely,
Herbert S. Taylor

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report discussing a "Man Injured in UAO Encounter". The text describes the story of James Flynn, a rancher from East Fort Myers, Florida, who was reportedly injured in an encounter with an unidentified aerial object (UAO). The text provides details about the incident and Flynn's experience.

MAN INJURED IN UAO ENCOUNTER
James Flynn, 42, a rancher of East Fort Myers, Florida, walked into the office of ophthalmologist Dr. Paul Brown in Fort Myers on Wednesday, 17 March. His right eye had been badly damaged. Flynn said he had been in his swamp buggy, just east of the Corkscrew Indian village, when he was nearly blinded. His right eye looked as if it had been struck by a blunt object. 
The story told by Flynn is fantastic. On Friday, the 12th, Flynn took his swamp buggy, camping gear and four dogs and set out for the Everglades about three miles east of the Corkscrew Indian village. 
As Flynn approached the Corkscrew village, he jumped a deer and ran off Flynn's whiting and called until about midnight, then returned to his swamp buggy and headed in the direction in which he last saw them running.
An hour later, at about 1 a.m. (Monday), Flynn spotted a huge light in the sky above the cypress about a mile away. The light was a brilliant white and resembled an inverted shallow bowl, he said. This object appeared to be 50 to 60 feet in diameter and about 25 to 30 feet from the ground. It then settled to the ground and appeared to hover. Flynn drove closer, got out of his vehicle, turned out the light on his swamp buggy and watched it with the darkness.
The object, he said, was about 25 feet in diameter (in diameter) at the bottom (in diameter) it it was high; the light from the top was a row of windows. Below which, there were three more rows of the same size—about 5 feet in diameter. Around the windows was a band of dark metal, he estimated to be about 2 feet wide. The object was about 25 to 30 feet from the ground.
Flynn looked through the windows to the bottom of the ship, was estimated of about 15 feet. Flynn judged the windows by comparing the object with the surrounding cypress trees, which were about 25 feet tall. It was some-what smaller than the object in size.
The object then rose slowly and silently and disappeared towards the north at a very high rate of speed.

Man Injured...
(Continued from page 1)

He and comprised of pieces of material that had become imbedded in his back and shoulder, and caused some muscular and nerve damage. He had superficial burns on his face, neck, and arms, a dull yellow light, and the area under the wings was an orange-red color. There was an intense humming noise coming from the UFO.

Flynn was by this time about % mile from the object and estimated its height to be about 40 feet. As he approached it, he got within a few yards of the object and it began to oscillate slowly up and down. The dog he had ran on the buggy in a rage, approached the object and frantically ran around it, barking. The object then accelerated rapidly, raising his arm and waved. He got 50 feet from the object, raised his arm and waved. He got the object, raised his arm and waved. He got 50 feet into the lighted area, raised his left arm, and swung it over his head to try to touch the object, but it seemed he could not reach it.

There was a bright flash that filled the entire area from about 10 feet under the bottom of the object to the ground, and a burst of intense light issued from the object which Flynn felt burn his face and arms. He experienced an electrical shock and fell unconscious to the ground.

After 2 or 3 hours of unconsciousness, he awoke with a severe headache and sore throat. He was lying on the ground about the same distance he had been when the object had hovered. His buggy was still in the same position but the dog was gone. His watch, which had been running perfectly, had stopped. He got up and found no trace of the dog. The dog's howls were not heard again. The entire event seemed to have occurred within a symmetrical circle of burned and scorched grass around the object. The grass within the circle was burned at the ground and had a brownish appearance to about 1 foot high. Outside the circle, the grass was undamaged.

The next day, after 24 hours of unconsciousness, he had no memory of events, as he had no recollection of the incident. When his wife brought him food, Flynn drove his buggy back to his home and went to sleep. After 2 miles, he awoke to find that the buggy was off the road and in a cornfield. He drove to the home of a Seminole Indian named Henry Hayes on the reservation. Hayes examined his face and eyes and got some ointment to put on his forehead, where the skin was burned. Hayes said that Flynn must have been struck by lightning.

After 9 days, Flynn was still under a doctor's care, blind in his right eye.

DISCUSSION:
The first consideration in this case is, of course, the integrity of our witness, and unless definite proof can be adduced to the contrary, his story must be accepted as true.

The evidence indicates that Mr. Flynn for 20 years has been considered reliable and of excellent character, and the report of his experience seems to be completely free of embellishment and consistent with similar previous reports. There is, of course, the usual bewilderment and confusion experienced by the witness, and his statements indicate a complete lack of understanding of the phenomena he observed.

"I have known Mr. Flynn for 25 years and have always considered him a reliable and honest man," states Dr. Larson, the physician who examined him. "His story is not exaggerated and I can find no reason to doubt its essential truth."

Mr. Flynn was accompanied by his 7-year-old son, who saw the same object and corroborated his father's account. The boy was not injured. The physical examination of Mr. Flynn showed only the effects of the burns and the blinding of the right eye, but no other abnormalities. There were also fresh scuff marks on the soles of his shoes which may have been caused by the light from the object as he attempted to reach it.

"About the fourth day in the hospital, Mr. Flynn complained of hearing defects," states the report. "This cleared up in about 24 hours." When last seen about a year later, his vision in the right eye was still impaired, and he was again checked. No physical defects were found, and the impaired vision could not be satisfactorily explained.

The report concludes that "this was a genuine UFO sighting and it appears to be one of the better documented cases in Project Blue Book files. Mr. Flynn is still perplexed by the experience and has stated that he wishes he had never encountered the object."

After examining the physical evidence and the credibility of the witness, there seems little reason to doubt the essential truth of Mr. Flynn's account. While the explanation of the various medical terms may be somewhat confusing, the significance of the patina on the sole of the shoe and the impaired vision clearly indicate that Mr. Flynn was in close proximity to a powerful energy source. The fact that he was unconscious for several hours, that his watch stopped, and that the dog's howls were not heard again are all factors which point to the genuineness of his experience.

well as a general anger. This general type of reaction has been before when Flynn could have inflicted these injuries on himself. It is unlikely that he would go to such length in order to promote a space ship story. It would not be logical for him to injure himself in this fashion.
The injury to his eye and forehead are consistent with experience as to body contact, and this is the only logical solution: that Flynn did indeed encounter a sighting in which he was slightly injured.
Assuming the above, we are faced with the question: who or what inflicted this injury? Were the injuries friendly, or were they meant to be hostile? However, there is a possibility that this could be explained as an unfriendly act on the part of Flynn, and this might be so. However, we cannot get too far off the track, and there is no reason to suspect that this was an unfriendly act to protect him from further contact. Synthesis of intent or the second makes no difference in the interpretation of the evidence. However, both alternatives fit the reasonable searching approach to the problem. The evidence of contacts (not to be confused with the type of contacts) in inaccurate and unreliable reports. Personal experiences of space flights are claimed, and especially those which lead to the injury of an individual. Hundreds of space flights have been made and interim circling the earth in addition to landing satellites, and much of this work is possible high and out of sight, and we should not expect these days, and protect it from the onslaught of scientific injury and explain that these vehicles are at least reasonably identified, the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for anyone that is involved, and the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for anyone that is involved, and the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for anyone that is involved, and the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for anyone that is involved, and the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for anyone that is involved, and the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for anyone that is involved, and the object is photographed, it is highly unusual for any-thing to fly around in our atmosphere, out of reach, and this is what is done to their visible sighting. However, a possible sighting somewhere in the area could indicate some scientific research--we just do not know. We do plan that they will land, and some may not; however, we must not ignore our sources in these cases. Obviously, they are capable of coming and going with our notice. They are not an accident or a prank, but we must not ignore our sources in these cases. Obviously, they are capable of coming and going with our notice. They are not an accident or a prank, but we must not ignore our sources in these cases. Obviously, they are capable of coming and going with our notice. They are not an accident or a prank, but we must not ignore our sources. We must attempt to be objective in our approach to the general public--but they will be more joy in the interest of scientific explanation than in demonstrating the immediate significance of "sightings" as evidence--whether it is possible or not.

The image appears to contain a photograph of a UFO object described as "UAO Photographed Clearly In Australia". The text below the image provides details about the sighting, including information about the freighter ship Iron Duke, the observations of witnesses, and the inability of astronomical experts to identify the object. The text also mentions RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) involvement and the use of powerful spotlights in the area. The article also discusses details about the movies or films related to the sighting.

UAO Photographed Clearly
In Australia

An abject described as a bright orange
glow with a "dent" on top and a "knot"
on the bottom, has been photographed
in Australia. This "unidentified aerial
object" was also an amateur photographer. 

Mr Walter Denzau, steward on the
freighter Iron Duke, said he saw the ob-
ject soon after 10 pm on March 17, 1968,
when he began to photograph a moon-
diated effect while at sea on the way to
Newcastle.

Astronomical experts in Adelaide have
been unable to identify the object, yet
Professor J. H. Carver, Professor of
Physics at Adelaide University and pa-
tron of the Astronomical Society of South
Australia, said on 4 April that the de-
tailed behavior of the object was con-
sistent with that of an aircraft, equipp-
ed with a very strong light.

An RAAF spokesman said that to his
knowledge there had been no planes
using powerful searchlights in the area at
that time. Otherwise the object could only have been a satel-
lite orbiting the earth and illuminated
by the moon.

There was no information in the Mel-
bourne Herald about the exact geograph-
ical location of the freighter. Neither did
the articles state whether the movies were black and white or in
color or still or moving pictures, although
the articles seem to indicate the photos
are color motion films.

NEWS BRIEFS: On March 18th, two Japanese civilian pilots reported that their planes were chased by 5 unidentified flying objects. Eyewitness reports indicate that the objects appeared to be pacing the planes. Office said that the planes involved were a Convair 240 airliner, with 28 passengers aboard, and a Beechcraft D-18 transport. The pilots reported seeing a brilliant bluish-white light at a distance of about 20 miles and radiating a greenish luminescence. As they approached their planes, the light disappeared. The pilots stated that their radios and instruments were working normally and the UFO was alongside... a distinguished group of scientists, including some of the nation's leading astronomers, have been conferring secretly in recent years whether there is life on mars. The group of 38 scientists, at the request of the National Academy of Sciences, have been studying the possibility that there may be uninhabited living organisms and that life independently originated there. The close approach of the Earth to Mars this year will, if living organisms are found, provide an opportunity for intensive study to determine whether life there has been transferred to Earth by meteorites or other means.

On March 13 between Hiroshima and Osaka, Japan, two shiny white objects chased two Japanese airliners for over 55 miles. These UFOs accelerated the flights of the airplanes and radically affected the plane's automatic devices and radios. These incidents were viewed as "serious" by international aviation officials. The document mentions that a Convair 340 or Vickers airliner and a small Piper aircraft were involved in these incidents. The document also refers to reports in the Pacific Stars and Stripes, which is a famous newspaper.

TEXT OUTPUT:

APRIL 19-MAY 65 ISSUE

UFO INVESTIGATOR

EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS HOAX CLAIM

According to NICAP's investigation, they received many reports on the alleged hoax of an unidentified flying object seen landing in a nearby woods last September. The witness, who claimed to have taken pictures, later told a reporter the sightings were false. However, NICAP's investigators who checked the site found substantial evidence that the sightings were genuine. The witness later denied making the hoax claim though it had already been published.

The "hoax confession" contains several other discrepancies. For example, the witness stated he had not taken any pictures, though previously he had said he took some. NICAP is investigating further, and new developments will be reported in a later issue.

REEVES STORY

The report of NICAP's investigation into an alleged "ghost light" seen by James C. Reeves of Beaverton, FIa., was reported in the February issue. Through prompt action, NICAP's investigators were able to check the site and interview the witness. After checking through their files, they found the Reeves sighting correlated with several previous reports of a similar phenomenon in the same area, though Reeves had not been aware of these. Two weeks later, the AF publicly announced the same conclusions NICAP had reached privately, that the light was probably a natural occurrence.

The AF states the messages were on file paper, in a simple code. There was no indication of a hoax or fraud.

These cases illustrate how NICAP's investigations frequently turn up evidence supporting the existence of UFOs, often correcting or contradicting the public statements of officials. Where the evidence warrants it, NICAP does not hesitate to question or challenge such statements as the two cases demonstrate.
