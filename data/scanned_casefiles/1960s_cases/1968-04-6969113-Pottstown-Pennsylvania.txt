Here is the text from the document:

[Top right corner]
(April 8, 1968)

Dear Sirs;

I am very interested
in flying saucers and do
much research in this
subject.

I have sighted a few
flying saucers, here is
my most exciting one.
My brother, cousin, and
I was sleeping in my
aunt's backyard and
were watching for flying
saucers. We sighted one
on the ground about
120 feet away. It was
about 12 feet long and
some bright lights at end.
We were scared stiff
at least I was. My
brother and my cousin
finally got it near enough

Here is the text from the document:

"This is what the sauce looked like â†’

courage to see what it was. As soon as they got about 25 feet away from it, it disappeared. This is no hoax or joke or anything - this is the truth!

Yours truly,

Pottstown Penn. 1946?

P.S. Could you please send me some information about flying saucers. (Thank you very) very much."
