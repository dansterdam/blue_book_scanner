The image contains a Project Blue Book record card, which appears to be a form used to document sightings of UFOs or other aerial phenomena. The record card includes various fields to record details about the sighting, such as the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, and a description of the observed object. In this specific case, the record card indicates that the sighting occurred on 1 February 1960 in the Atlantic Ocean at coordinates 53-05N, 22-15W. The description states that the object was generally conforming to the pattern of a "missile" observation, and it is concluded that the object was likely a meteor.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

U.F.O. ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Norton Sound, 53-22N, 170-22W
Date: 2 Feb 60
WT: 2200 Z
Description of Object: Bright light, moving with great speed for approx. 4-5 sec
Size: Approx. 1/4 moon
Direction of Motion: Eastward, slow, jerky motion
Satellite: (AGENA-11), Photo 69,192) Observed @ 2200Z, 2/2/60
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Barker -
Radar Analysis (AGCIN-L:L): Nil
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Barker: Mil, Pur, normal
Other: -
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Poor -
Analysis and Conclusions: The report indicates that the object observed was a bright light moving with great speed for approximately 4-5 seconds. It was approximately 1/4 the size of the moon and exhibited a slow, jerky eastward motion. The observer, Barker, was unable to identify the object conclusively, but did rule out some potential explanations such as satellites, astronomical phenomena, and normal aircraft. The overall reliability of the source is considered poor.
