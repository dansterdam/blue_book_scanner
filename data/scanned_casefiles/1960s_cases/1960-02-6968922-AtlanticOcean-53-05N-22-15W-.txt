Evaluation of Source Reliability: PROBABLY GOOD -

Analysis and Conclusions: THE REPORT INDICATES ONLY THE
PILOT SAW THIS OBJECT BUT IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT THE OBJECT AS SHOWN ALSO SHOW THE OBJECT.
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT IS THAT OF
THE CLASSIC "FLYING SAUCER" AND IT IS CONCLUDED
THAT SUCH SIGHTINGS CAN BE RESOLVED AS
THAT POSSIBLY IT WILL BE ASSUMED THAT OTHERS
SAW THIS OBJECT AND IT WILL NOT BE
CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED.
