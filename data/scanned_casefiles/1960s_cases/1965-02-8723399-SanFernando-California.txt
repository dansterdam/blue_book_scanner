Engines: 
I have sight of two separate UFOs. One of them on March 8, 1963 and another in February 4, 1965.
Specifically, all the sightings would give details. Please desire to report a sighting this time so that the same can be looked into carefully. I was able to observe their hovering and movement, the size of their occupants. I am unable to give the exact location even though closely watched their activities. I here submit the brief report of sightings for your consideration.
