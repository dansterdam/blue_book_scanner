NO. 7-1128    4-17    1967

SUBJECT: Alleged Unidentified Flying Object

OFFICER: WOLCOTT/VG

COMPLAINANT AND WITNESS #1: [Redacted], Eugene, Oregon, DOB 9-18-45, wears glasses.
Street
345-6905

CO-COMPLAINANT AND WITNESS #2: [Redacted], Eugene, Oregon, DOB 4-15-44, does not wear glasses.
689-0475

TIME & LOCATION:
4-5-67, 7:45 p.m., on Interstate 5, approximately 1 mile South of Goshen, Oregon.

WEATHER:
Heavy cloud cover, ceiling approximately 2000 feet, on a clear night.

DETAILS:
At 3:13 p.m. date, the above witnesses relayed the following story at the Sheriff's Office.

[Redacted] stated he was driving a 1958 Plymouth station wagon, white over red, travelling South at approximately 60 miles an hour, when at the above location, he observed what he stated looked exactly like a satellite, approximately 1000 feet overhead. He stated it looked like a bright white light, however, he was unable to determine any visible shape.

He stated the object was flying from West to East. It was going slow, and was thought not to be a satellite. He stated it proceeded East for approximately 10 seconds, then made a 90 degree turn to the right and headed South. It seemed to speed up and then disappeared in approximately 10 seconds.

The witnesses further stated they continued on Interstate 5, Southbound, when they reached the vicinity of the Creswell Airport, they observed a white light hovering over the airport at approximately 2-3 degrees elevation. Witness continued, "As we watched it, it turned red. Then the object proceeded North and stopped in mid-air." The witnesses searched for the vehicle, to watch the object, at which time they observed three lights, a red, and a white and a green. The lights then proceeded towards the witnesses at a high rate of speed at which time the witnesses stated they got into their vehicle and continued watching the object. Witnesses stated that at no time did they hear any engine noise or rushing of wind. The object then landed near Creswell Airport and taxied over near a hangar. The lights seemed to move in a circular motion and then the object disappeared.

OFFICER'S REPORT
NO. 67-2144
DATE 4-17-1967

DETAILS: (Continued)

The witnesses further stated that on 4-6-67, they went to the Creswell Airport and talked with the proprietor, which as they stated, did not seem to know too much about aircraft which made them suspicious and they thought perhaps the proprietor of the airport may know more than he was telling then.

AT 6:00 p.m. date, the writer went to the Creswell Airport and talked with the proprietor who can stated he observed nothing this night in question. The writer then asked to go through the airport buildings at which time the manager of the airport agreed. The writer searched all outbuildings with negative results.

No further action anticipated by writer.
