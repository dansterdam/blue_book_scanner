OFFICER'S REPORT

TIME .   3:13 p.m.
PLACE: Sheriff's Office
SUBJECT: Alleged Unidentified Flying Object
OFFICER: WOLCOTT/VS

COMPLAINANT AND WITNESS: 
___________ Street
Eugene, Oregon

CO-COMPLAINANT AND WITNESS #2:
__________ 
Eugene, Oregon
687-0475

TIME & LOCATION:
4-5-67, 7:45 p.m. on Interstate 5, approximately 8 mile South of Goshen, Oregon.

WEATHER: Heavy cloud cover, ceiling approximately 2000 feet, on a clear night.

DETAILS: 
At 3:13 p.m. date, the above witnesses related the following story at the Sheriff's Office:
He stated he was driving a 1956 Plymouth station wagon, white over red, travelling South at approximately 60 miles an hour, when at the above location he observed what he described as a brilliant, extremely bright white light, hovering in a stationary position at approximately 1600 foot elevation. He stated this object was the size of a dime held at arm's length.
He stated the object was flying from West to East. It was moving slow, and then all of a sudden accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and headed South. It seemed to be under intelligent control. The witnesses further stated they continued on Interstate 5, Southbound, when they observed a bright white light hovering over the airport at approximately 200 foot elevation. This light continued for several minutes and then the object proceeded North and stopped in mid-air. The witnesses then proceeded to observe the object for some time, noting it hovered with a slight tilting motion and a swaying motion, and a pulsating light which seemed to turn on and off at intervals. The lights then proceeded towards the witnesses at a high rate of speed but the object did not come close enough for them to hear any engine noise or rushing of wind. The object then seemed to accelerate and moved in a circular motion and then the object disappeared.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned copy of an Officer's Report from the Sheriff's Office in Lane County, Oregon, dated 4-17-67. The report details an incident that occurred on 4-5-67, where witnesses stated they went to the Creswell Airport and talked with the proprietor about an aircraft they saw that they were not sure what it was. The report indicates that the writer went to the Creswell Airport, spoke with the manager, and searched all outbuildings, but no further action was anticipated.

The text from the document is as follows:

DETAILS: (continued)
The witnesses further stated that on 4-5-67 they went to the Creswell Airport and talked with the proprietor, as they stated did not seem to know too much about aircraft which made them suspicious and they thought perhaps the proprietor or the airport knew more than he was telling them.

AT 6:00 p.m. date, the writer went to the Creswell Airport and talked with the proprietor who stated he observed nothing the night in question. The writer searched all outbuildings with negative results. The manager of the airport seemed unaware. The writer searched all outbuildings with negative results.

No further action anticipated by writer.
