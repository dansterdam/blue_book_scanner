16. At approximately 2150Z, 12 Jul 65, this organization and the FAA began receiving telephone calls from residents, also news media stating that a UFO had been seen. These reports came from the Pittsburgh area and surrounding areas. The object described by many individuals, was round and moving in a general westerly direction.

The Pennsylvania Air National Guard was notified. Burnish advised that F102's were in the general area of the UFO and sighted same, and orbited the UFO but it was above them.

It was concluded that the UFO sighted from Harrisburg, Pa. across the state over Pittsburgh was a weather balloon. The F102's were at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet when UFO was sighted.

The UFO was above them. It was also concluded that the UFO may have been some type of research type balloon moving westerly at an altitude in excess of 40,000 feet. No information concerning same was released to the news media by this organization. However, news media in the Pittsburgh area informed the public that the object was a weather balloon.

July 15, 1965

Maj. Hector Quintanella
F.T.D.
T.D.E. (UFO)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Fairborn, Ohio

Dear Maj. Quintanella;

I wonder if you could give me any additional information concerning the object which my neighbors and I saw in the sky north of Athens Monday evening, July 12th? From various newspaper accounts, I gather that it was apparently seen by many people throughout this entire area, yet I still have not seen any explanation for it.

Several neighbors and I first saw the object about 7:30 p.m., almost due north of Athens and at a height of about 40-45° above the horizon; it was moving very slowly towards the NW (as near as we can tell from our maps, it should have passed almost right over Wright-Patterson Air Base). I subsequently photographed the object with a telephoto lens, and then watched it through field glasses until it finally disappeared as a tiny pin-point of light high in the NW sky, about 9:00 p.m.

The most logical explanation, of course, is that it was a high-altitude research balloon, but even that theory leaves many unanswered questions:

1) Where did it come from, and why didn't the FAA know anything about it? An object so big that it can be seen at almost the same time at places 100 miles apart just can't be launched by some kid in his backyard.

2) Where did it go? Dam should have revealed it somewhere over the Dakotas, and it would have been as hard to miss in their skies as it was in ours.

3) Neither observation through field glasses nor the photographs show either an instrument package or any kind of marking light. I can just imagine what a high-flying balloon of that size would do to a plane in the middle of the night!

In short, can it be that our multi-billion dollar defense establishment, can protect us from enemy bombers, rockets, and missiles—but leaves us wide-open to attack by BALLOONS? I hope the word never reaches Havanna.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature area blacked out]

NEWS BRIEFS (Continued:) Among the several other recent flaps in various parts of the United States was one in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland, on the night of July 12th. Thousands of people in that "tri-state area phoned news media, police, and sheriffs' offices to report a huge object at very high altitude. It may have been a weather balloon, although a spokesman for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base stated that he "had no idea what the object was."

Dear Mr.

Forgive me for not having written sooner, but I have been out of the office for the past week end and I am now just getting back to my normal routine.

With regards to your letter of 15 July, I will try to answer your questions honestly.

The object, which you and your neighbors observed on 12 July, was a high-pressure research balloon. This balloon is an experimental balloon used in measuring cosmic radiation at altitudes of 80,000 - 150,000 ft. The balloon was 250 - 300 ft long and the payload (measuring instrument package) was approximately five feet in diameter. We are still trying to locate them because they are quite valuable.

The balloon was released in Canada by an industrial company who is under contract to do this type of research for the US Navy. With regards to your question of why the FAA didn't know about the balloon, etc., honestly, I don't know the answer to that one.

I would like to comment on your description of the object, the setting, etc. Your type of report makes my job a lot easier.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

Maj. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Chief, Project Blue Book
FTD (TDEW)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Maj. Quintanilla,

Thank you very much for your letter of July 28, concerning the object seen in the Athens area on July 12. Although you probably consider the case closed by now, I have enclosed a print of the photograph I took of the object, with the thought that it may be of use to you in future sightings.

Were the two missing balloons ever found? It does seem incredible that two 250-300 foot high radar targets--this object was obviously metalized--could be 'lost' in an area so saturated with radar equipment.

Two further developments regarding the July 12 sighting which may be of interest to you:

1) A friend in Yellow Springs, Ohio--a commercial photographer and former magazine editor--reports that he observed what was apparently, from his description, the same object almost over Yellow Springs at about 8:30 p.m. At this time it appeared to be virtually motionless, so after watching it for approximately 10 minutes he went to his studio to get a telephoto lens with which to photograph it. When he returned to his vantage point a few minutes later, however, the object was nowhere in sight. His neighbors, who had also been watching the object, told him that it had suddenly accelerated "with the speed of a plane" and disappeared from sight.

2) Still puzzled by the fact that I had been working out-of-doors for some time prior to our original sighting of the object--in an area which has a good view of the eastern sky--I checked with the dispatchers of the local Ohio Highway Patrol, Athens County Sheriff, and Athens Police Dept. Judging by the object's rate of movement towards the west, once we had it under observation, I estimated that it should have taken approximately 2 hours to move from the eastern horizon to the point NNW of Athens where we first observed it.

From the telephone logs of these law enforcement agencies, however, I found that the initial calls to all three agencies had come in within 10 minutes of each other, at approximately 7:40-7:50 p.m.--and from then on they warned. Yet there were no apparent changes in weather conditions, light, cloud cover, etc., which could account for the object being 'invisible' in southeastern Ohio until approximately 7:45 p.m.

Do you have any further information on the rash of sightings in the Oklahoma area in early August?

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

On Wednesday night July 14th, my boss and my husband were night fishing on Horsehead Lake near Mecosta, Michigan and sighted an object which certainly sounds like the description of your cosmic ray balloon.

Rather than beaming a spotlight, the men reported that it glowed.

We all hope that you find your missing balloons.

MEMO TO: TDEW (Major H. Quintanilla)
FROM: TDFGCC (Meteor) Wind data received by phone from 3WW (Mr. Hayes) in support of a balloon sighted drifting from the vicinity of Harrisburg, Pa. to Dayton, Ohio, 12-13 July 1965.

1. The mean flow for these two days in the region from Harrisburg to Dayton at 50,000 to 55,000 feet was from the Northwest between 280 degrees and 310 degrees at 30 knots.
These data were obtained from inspection of analyzed data at the 100 millibar pressure level.

2. The mean flow obtained from the next higher pressure level, 50 millibars, is represented of the 55,000 to 70,000 layer:

a. On 12 July the flow was from the northeast 030 degrees at about 10 knots.

b. On 13 July the flow veered to be more from the east, 070 degrees, at 10 knots.

3. The levels immediately above this layer would retain the same general direction but would have higher speeds. A speed of 50 knots or better could be maintained from 80-120,000 feet. Generally, the balloon speed along its trajectory is considerably less than any one reported speed.


- page 54 -

Memo for the Record:

Wind data was received from Sulpher Grove on the morning of 13 Jul 65 regarding observations on the night of 12 Jul 65.

At 2020 hours they observed through a telescope a balloon, looked like a stratosphere balloon, big clear balloon. They said that the satellite tracking unit there, saw it even after the sun went down and watched it with moonlight.

Their weather balloon was launched at 1800 hours and burst at 1925.

13 July 65

Phil Donahue called from WHIO, Dayton, Ohio. Wanted information from Maj Quintanilla on sightings on night of 12 July 65. Informed him that it was high atmosphere balloon. Asked how do we substantiate the fact that it was a high atmosphere balloon. (1) F102's over Pennsylvania identified it as such. (2) Sulpher Grove Balloon launch personnel saw object at 820pm and identified it as upper air research balloon.

Phil Donahue wanted to come out here and take a 45 second film tape for television news on this subject. Major Quintanilla explained that this was not possible as permission had to be granted by the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Information in Washington, D C and this would take several days.

WHIG Radio from Xenia, Ohio called. Wanted information from Maj Quintanilla on sightings on night of 12 July 1965. Informed him that it was high atmosphere balloon and that we were still checking to see who launched. Sulpher Grove identified it was a balloon with instrument package.

Mr Al Morris at NCAR, Boulder, Colorado. No did they did not have any launched in that time. Could have been one of theirs. Last one was two months ago and was 18ft in diameter, travelling from East to West. There was one over the 1/2 Azores on 9 Jul. We told him air weather service saw it from the ground. Morris said that if they had seen it from a plane at about 40,000 ft it could have been theirs cause a balloon might have endured a second trip around.

Mr Reer, from Pittsburgh Information Officer at Pittsburgh, Pa. Said Air National Guards evaluation was a balloon. Told him it was a high altitude atmospheric balloon. In accord with AFR 200-2 he will send complete report paying particular attention to comments of xx preparing officer. His extension is 683.

13 Jul 65 call made to Elm.Boski, ONR, at the DOD, phone Liberty 5 - 6700, ext 64723, Office of Naval Research. They launch from Churchill, Canada.

It was not their balloon, positive no. All theirs are accounted for. There's fly around 100,000 ft.

13 Jul 65 called Lockbourne AFB, 301st Intelligence, spoke with Colonel Patterson who said they had had some UFO activity and some reports. Put Lt Hender on phone to get Major Quintanilla's phone number etc. It was a Lt Taylor who handled reports. Hender's said they had no information on object, also he said he saw object for about ten minutes. They said that Lockbourne had not put up any jets to look for object.

At 1500 hours on 13 Jul 65 Major Stiles from SAFOI called. Major Quintanilla informed him that we have been trying to get through to him. It was his unfortunate experience to answer the phone since Sara was out because news agencies and Scrip Hover and others were asking about UFOs over Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohioandindiana. Major explained that one of the earlier observa-tions at Dayton, Ohio was a weather balloon seen at 620pm. Other observations were a high altitude balloon with gondola. We have not found who launched this balloon, however we are continuing to research. Balloon launchers at Sulpher Grove said that it was an upper air research balloon with package, also F-102 pilots over Pittsburgh went up and observed the balloon with a gondola attached.

On 14 Jul 65 Mr Al Morris called from NCAR he had Mr Vince\ Lalloy in his office. Lalloy had a news clipping of the Azores, he thinks it was one of his balloons on its second go around. on 23 Jun 65 they launched a couple of unusual super pressures, balloons, to check out how stable they are, one was a conventional balloon 10,000 feet, tracked for a few days, another balloon was at around 6500 ft, two balloons tied together, 20 ft long 18 inches in diameter, they were just strapped together, looked ¢ like one long cylinder, with payload, if it would have survived it would be at an altitude of 6000ft.

In order to clarify, would have to find an observer who would saw it was long, size of the balloon is not important, the shape was good, the payload should be vertical, can we check this for NCAR. Lalloy will be flying from new Zealand on a ¢project starting in September for 127 nations. He mentioned that the Air Force Cambridge Research Lab is flying things but won't tell.

Should talk to a Tom Kelley 274-6100, ext 3013.

We talked to Cambridge Massachusetts again and they said no they didn't have any classified balloon projects at present and all balloons were accounted for.

Memo for the Record: 122d received a call from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
He had talked to Colonel at Air National Guard and was referred to our
office and wanted to know if we could give some information on UFO of this
past week over Pittsburgh. Asked who he was: Mr Whitesall from national
investigative committee on aerial phenomena. Told him to call Mrs Hunt in
Washington. Wanted to know wef would transfer the call. Told him
Mrs Hunt was tf with the Secretary of the Air orce office of Information
in Washington D C and that the call could not be transferred. Told him
that they released all information on this information subject. He said
he realized this in accordance with AFR 200-2, paragraph 9. He wanted to
know if we were still investigating, told him that SAFOI was the release
on all information. Sgt Jones told him that the Project Officer Major
Quintanilla was out to lunch right now and would be back at 1pm. Sgt Jones
said that he didn't know anything. Thisman asked him, well what do you do,
Sgt Jones said he answered the phone and typedup the reports and didn't
know anything about these UFO reports. Whitesall said he would call back
about 1pm for the Major.

Mr Whitesell
Mr called back and Major Quintanilla told him he was positive it was a balloon.

2.94/cu ft balloon was launched at 0349 local on 5 Jul
near Vancouver
Tracked visually until midnight on 7 Jul 65, 114° W Long
58.35° N Latitude, drifting West at 50 miles an hour.

- page 63 -

Here is the text from the document:

Called Mr Henry Demboski, OMR on 16 Jul 65. They released four balloons on 5 Jul 65.
mil
Two of which they lost track on. 2.94/cu ft balloon beacon went out, tracked for
five hours after launch. Launched at 0349 local and was seen over at Vancouver
on 7 Jul, tracked visually until midnight, 114° W long 58.35°N latitude, drifting
West/at 50 miles an hour. Other balloon, 10.6 million cu ft balloon launched at
0025 local was presumed down, because everything went out on balloon. It had been
tracked visually for twelve hours.

2.94 Million
Cu Ft Balloon.

These balloons were released by a contractor at Churchill, Canada. Left Churchill
at 125,000 ft alt. The balloon is approximately 200 ft long, a parachute about
30 ft then another line 20 ft to payload, making total size approximately 250 to
300 ft extended. Length is greater than diameter. The package carried was a sphere
5 ft in diameter. Said something may have gone wrong in the ducting. It is a
Cosmic Ray Research Experiment and there is nothing classified on it. They fly
from Churchill for it is the conversion to the magnetic line, they project their
balloons to the West. At first he didn't think it could be their balloon but
after many phone calls he feels there is a good probability of it being theirs.
Doesn't understand why no one picked it up on radar as it had radar reflector on it.
Of the four balloons launched on the 5th these are the only two not recovered.
Would appreciate getting it back, its a sophisticated package worth approximately
$100,000.

Churchill is on Hudson Bay, 58° North latitude near Manitoba, Canada.

We are positive it is a balloon, however, additional confirmation can not be made
unless the package from one of these two balloons is found.

Man From UFO: It Was Balloon
DAYTON DAILY NEWS 19 JULY 1965

That mysterious sky object seen by thousands in Ohio and other states east last week was a Navy balloon released in Canada July 5, the Air Force says.

Officials at Project Bluebook, the Air Force's investigative agency for unidentified flying objects, had previously identified the object as a balloon but were uncertain of the launching site.

NOW SGT. David Moody, at Wright-Patterson Air Force base, says four balloons were released July 5 by the U. S.

Navy at Churchill, Man. on Hudson Bay. Two of the balloons, used for cosmic ray research, are missing, Moody said.

He said the object seen over the Dayton area was one of the two missing balloons.

He said the balloons, 200 to 300 feet tall, are valued at about $100,000, including their special scientific cargo. They normally fly at about 125,000 feet, he said.

The sky object was reported seen by thousands of people last Monday night. Some said it glowed. Others said it beamed a spotlight on the ground.

in Ohio and three other states a week ago last night to report they
had seen a mysterious flying object, an official at Project Blue-
book, the Air Force's investigative agency for unidentified flying
objects, said yesterday.

Sgt. David Moody at Wright-
Patterson Air Force base said
two of four balloons released
July 5 by the U.S. Navy at
Churchill, Manitoba, on Hudson
bay are missing.

We can't possibly determine if
these two balloons are the miss-
ing ones until we recover the
balloons, Sgt. Moody said. "There-
fore, we're not sure one of these
flying objects was one of the bal-
loons."

He explained that upward wind
data studies must be completed
before positive identification can
be made.

The four balloons used for cos-
mic ray research, are 200 to 300
feet tall and are valued at $100,-
000 each, Moody said. They fly
at an altitude of from 70,000 to 125,-
000 feet depending on the height
they are programmed.

DUCKSTONES IN VERSE

Officials Trip Over Selv
Trying to Identify Objec

Why is it that man refuses to believe
in the unknown? Last Monday night,
July 12, there appeared an object in
the sky. It was seen in four states
by thousands of persons, including
myself.

I was later told by the Air Force
that it definitely was not a balloon.
Because of the estimated altitude, it
would have to be hundreds of feet in
diameter.

A day later the Air Force then said
it definitely was a balloon, but they
didn't know where it came from.

How definite is definite if one day
they make a statement and the next
day they completely contradict them-

selves? Are they trying to hide some-
thing from the public? It seems that
way.

Then another official said it was
the planet Venus. OK, let's say it was
Venus since it moved easy as all
planets do. Why did Venus then
move from north to east the next
night as it was reported when the
same, or similar, object was again
sighted and given the same name?
Planets don't do these things.

And then even another official said
it was a satellite. Do satellites orbit
at an altitude of only 80,000 feet? I
didn't know this.

Finally, I saw the object through
my telescope, which magnified it considerably. Venus? Bunk. Satellite?
Possibly, except from where did it
come? And it looked like no balloon
ever seen before.

UFO? What else would you call it?

Young Astronomers Think UFO Is Type Of Satellite

What is the round, glittering object spotted in the skies over Springfield and the area? Members of "The Spotters," a youthful astronomy group, feel certain that it is some type of satellite and not a weather balloon.

And according to Reg Snyder, 12, of 611 Mead Lane, spokesman for the group, the object has been seen in the area for approximately five weeks and can be seen at 1:30 p.m. or so, an estimated five degrees southwest of the sun.

He uses a 175-power telescope and his scientific friends, ages 10, 11 and 12, have been watching it from different locations in Springfield, some with the naked eye.

"We checked at first thinking that it might be the planet Venus, but Venus at this time is not in that area," he said Wednesday.

The same opinion was voiced by a spokesman at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Columbus. The unidentified flying object could not be a satellite because it remained stationary for long periods of time—sometimes 20 minutes.

And a pilot from the air base estimated the object to be 60,000 to 80,000 feet above the earth, having climbed to 31,000 feet in an unsuccessful effort to get close to the UFO.

Earlier reports concerning a similar object "several hundred feet" in diameter came from South America, where observers said they were certain it was not an aircraft, satellite or balloon because of its "exceptional maneuverability" and ability to remain "motionless for 20-30 minutes" at a time.

UFO Definitely
Big Balloon,
Air Force Says

DAYTON, O., July 15—(AP)—
"It is definitely a balloon, and
it is definitely a big balloon," the
Air Force said Wednesday of
a sky-riding object that had thousands of people in at least four
states puzzled for several days.

What's more, Maj. Hector Quintanilla of "project bluebook," the
Air Force's investigative agency
for unidentified flying objects,
said he thinks he's found "the
culprit."

Maj. Quintanilla said the balloon sighted in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland was not the same type of balloon that his office, by a process of elimination, has limited the origin of the balloon to the East Coast, and, probably, the property of an Air Force station.

He declined to say what station.

He said only "we think we've
found the culprit." He said Air
National Guard planes flew close
to the object over the Pittsburgh
area and identified it as a big
weather balloon with an instrument package in its tail.

The big balloon had moved
from east to west and as the thousands of people saw it in the sky,
telephone switchboards were overloaded at newspaper offices, police stations and other public offices. Many people tried to find out what the object was.

College astronomy professor
who investigated also said it was
a balloon, riding as high as 15
to 20 miles.

Flying Object, Seen Widely, May Have Been Satellite

A round, glittering object spotted in skies over Springfield Monday was not a weather balloon, as was reported earlier. It may have been a satellite, military sources said.

Seen over Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland, the object was generally conceded at first to be a weather balloon. However, no agency responsible for the flying object claimed it.

The Federal Aviation Agency, which reported it informed on such matters, said it had no report of any weather balloons being launched Monday except one in Tyler, Tex. A spokesman said it was doubtful this balloon was the object, since the Tyler balloon was launched only a short time before the first unidentified object report was made in Ohio Monday morning.

A spokesman at Lockbourne Air Force Base, near Columbus, said the object spotted in the mid-eastern states was a satellite. He too declined further comment.

A report that the object "definitely" was the planet Venus came from Friend Kierstead, of the Akron-Canton area. Officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, said the object was an "Unidentified Flying Object" and they did not know for sure what the object was or where it was from. They said they were tracking it.

Wright-Patterson, Lockbourne and the Weather Bureau said the object appeared much larger than any of their weather balloons—several hundred feet in diameter. Some reports said Lockbourne said it uses six-foot-wide balloons.

The chief meteorologist at the Columbus Weather Bureau said it appeared as "an inverted flow" through teardrop "Descriptions by others who watched the object though telescopes ranged from round to oval-shaped." Reports on the color varied widely from white, to silver-blue to orange depending on where and whether it was day, dusk or night when it was sighted.

Early speculation that it might be the big Echo satellite balloon was discounted by the Smithsonian and the Soho Laboratory in Cleveland said if it was moving on a west to east course over northeast Ohio the same time reports were coming in far to the south.

Sightings were reported from Harrisburg, Pa., Monday afternoon, then shortly afterward at Lancaster, York and Uniontown, Pa.; Cumberland, Md.; Johnstown, Pa.; Morgantown, W. Va.; Wheeling, W. Va. and about the same time in the Athens, Newark, Chillicothe and Columbus, Ohio; Hamilton and Springfield areas.

It was reported that an object had been spotted west of Columbus early Monday morning. Thousands of bewildered persons who saw it telephoned news media, the Weather Bureau, police, and other offices. Jamming switchboards, Columbus police said they received an estimated 500 calls between 6 and 9 p.m. The Columbus Dispatch said it received a similar number.

There also were reports that the balloon-like objects were burning red flames.

Presence of the glittering sphere over the Springfield area brought a rush of telephone calls to the Springfield News and Sun offices, from persons interested in finding out what the object was.

Area Residents Again Sight UFO In Skies Over Dayton

A bright object in the sky over which the National Investigation committee on Aerial Phenomena says he has received in Washington.

The unidentified object was first seen Monday night by many residents and several official sources offered opinions on what it was with no consensus being reached.

Despite reports of the object and a published article that unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings were increasing recently, officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force base say they have not had an increase in UFO reportings in recent months.

A spokesman for "Project Blue Book", the WAFB organization which keeps tabs on all UFO reports, said his office has not received an increase in reports.

The national committee said earlier this week it has had the biggest number of UFO reports since 1957, with some 20 sightings in the past two weeks.

The Blue Book spokesman said things are about normal here with only an occasional report although dozens of calls were received about Monday's and yesterday's "thing" in the sky.

The major said the object might have been a balloon released Monday at the weather station, or it might have been the planet Venus.

All reports of the object, seen at about 70,000 feet in Ohio and neighboring states, are being investigated, the spokesman said.

Mysterious Flying Object Balloon, Base Expert Says

The flying object spotted in four states Monday night was definitely a high altitude balloon with an instrument package in its tail, an Air Force expert said today.

Maj. Hector Quintanilla, head of the Air Force Unidentified Flying Object Investigative unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force base, said he was sure of his findings.

"IT IS DEFINITELY a balloon and it's definitely a biz balloon," he said. "It was not the small balloon the weather bureau might use."

Maj. Quintanilla said his Project Blue Book unit at the base is now trying to find out where it was launched.

"I THINK we know the culprit," he said. "The balloon, he said, is believed to have been launched on the East Coast.

The balloon was spotted as it skimmed westward in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and Ohio. There were numerous sightings in this area.

MAJ. QUINTANILLA said two Air National Guard pilots in Pittsburgh flew close enough to it to report that it was a high altitude balloon.

The major said additional details about the balloon would be made public as soon as details already gathered can be confirmed.

High Flying Object Identified By AF

The Air Force has identified a high flying object which excited residents in four states Monday night as "definitely a balloon, and it is definitely a big balloon." "Project Bluebook," the Air Force's investigative agency for unidentified flying objects (UFO), said he thinks he's found "the culprit."

However, Major Quintanilla would not pinpoint where the balloon came from. He did say his office, by process of elimination, has determined the balloon came from somewhere on the East Coast, probably and Air Force station.

He said only, "We think we've found the culprit."

College astronomy professors who investigated the object said it was a balloon and flying as high as 15 to 20 miles.

Air National Guard planes flew close to the object over the Pittsburgh area and reported it was a big weather balloon with an instrument package in its tail.

Reports from residents in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland loaded telephone switchboards of newspaper offices, police stations, air bases and other public offices.

SPOTTED IN SEVERAL OHIO CITIES

Unidentified Flying Object Has Switchboards Humming

By PERRY SMITH
Daily News Staff Writer

An unidentified flying object slammed over Ohio yesterday and switchboards jammed with calls in Dayton and several other cities.

Nobody, with the possible exception of comedian Jonathan Winters, who once made a record of eyewitness accounts of a flying saucer, seemed to know what it was. There were all kinds of theories.

THE SPOTTINGS came on the heels of an Air Force announcement that it had no recent reports of unidentified UFO activity.

It does now.

Lockbourne Air Force base at Columbus sent up a jet to get a closer look at the object, reported hovering between 8,000 and 80,000 feet.

THE PILOT reported that he was no closer to the object at 21,000 feet - the highest he went - than when he was on the ground.

Government agencies couldn't agree on what the object described by a meteorologist as looking like an inverted flow through teabag, might have been.

The Federal Aviation agency said it had no reports of any weather balloons being launched Monday except in Tyler, Tex.

LAST NIGHT in FAA in Columbus said to disregard any earlier report that it might have been a weather balloon.

It would not comment further.

A spokesman at Lockbourne said it was a satellite. He wouldn't elaborate.

The Akron-Canton Satellite Tracking group, which traces satellites for the government, said it was the Planet Venus.

ORBIT ANALYST Friend Kierstead said the planet became "visible after moving within close range of the sun.

Official at Wright-Patterson AFB, home of the Air Force's UFO center, said they did not know for sure what the object was or where it came from. They said they tracked it.

Sightings were reported over Harrisburg, Lancaster, York and Uniontown, Pa.; Cumberland, Morgantown and Wheeling, W.Va. and these Ohio cities: Athens, Newark, Chillicothe, Columbus, Dayton, Springfield and Hamilton.

Mrs. Fred Horsman of 462 Shroyer Rd., said her son, Lee Hodgson, 45, of 1845 Norton Ave., spotted the object while he was visiting her home.

Mrs. Horsman said it was just getting dusk when her son spotted the disc. She said the temperature seemed to cool off all of a sudden about the same time.

LATE THIS morning, Maj. Hector Quintanilla Jr., chief of Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson, said one of the objects spotted locally was a weather balloon.

The balloon was released about 6 p.m. at Sulphur Grove. He said it accounted for several sightings around 6:30.

IRONICALLY, those who released the weather balloon made a sighting, their own. Using a telescope, they spotted a conical shaped object traveling westward.

Maj. Quintanilla said the object, at an altitude of 70,000 to 80,000 feet, may have been a high-altitude balloon. His staff is investigating to see if it was.

20 IN 2 WEEKS
UFO Sightings
Up, Group Says

WASHINGTON, July 12 (UPI)—The National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena said last night the world is experiencing its biggest increase of unidentified flying objects since 1957.

A spokesman for the non-profit research organization said that at least 20 so-called flying saucers have been reported during the past two weeks over most parts of the world, including Antarctica.

THE AIR FORCE, which keeps track of reported sightings, said it had no recent reports of unidentified UFO activity. Most sightings reported in the past have turned out to be natural phenomena, balloons or meteors, a spokesman said.

The Air Force added that because there is no definite pattern to reports of unidentified flying objects, they seem to be unrealistic.

Richard Hall, NICAP director, countered the Air Force denial.

"IT IS INTERESTING" that the Air Force is unable to find a pattern, because it is staring them in the face," he said.

On Mar. 21, Hall said, a Japanese airline pilot saw a UFO when a plane was flying 60 miles. According to Hall, the pilot, Yoshitake Inada, said the flying saucer violently accelerated the plane's air direction finder.

"Another similar sighting happened Tuesday in Antarctica," Hall said. A British and Argentine scientific team reported a UFO when sent their geometric instruments.

Yesterday electromagnetic watches at Santa Maria airport in the Azores stopped for 10 minutes while witnesses reported seeing a UFO. The operator said the craft moved slowly in a northwesterly direction. He described it as a white cylinder, which sometimes looked like a balloon.
