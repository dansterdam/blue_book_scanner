16. At approximately 2150Z, 12 Jul 65, this organization and the FAA began receiving reports of sightings of an object described as a bright light, had a UFO and was reported stationary. The object described by many individuals, was round and moving in a general westerly direction. The Pennsylvania Air National Guard was notified. It was stated that two F102's would be scrambled. F102's were in the general area of the UFO and sighted same and circle flew UFO high above them. This organization informed the state west over Pittsburgh was a weather balloon. The F102's were at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet when UFO was sighted. The UFO was above them. It was also concluded that the UFO may have been some type of research laboratory balloon moving westerly at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet. No information concerning game was released to the news media by this organization. However, news media in the area informed the individuals that the object was a weather balloon.

Maj. Hector Quintanella
F.o.D.
t.D.E. (UFO)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Fairborn, Ohio

Dear Maj. Quintanella:

I wonder if you could give me any additional information regarding the object which my neighbor and I saw in the sky north of Athens Monday evening, July 12th? From various newspaper accounts, I gather that it was apparently seen by many people throughout this entire area, yet still how we can't explain any explanation for it.

Several neighbors and I first saw the object about 7:30 P.M. as it moved north of Athens and at a height of about 40-45° above the horizon: it was moving very slowly towards the NNE (as near as we could tell from our lineup, it should be about 1/4 to 1/2 mile above the ground). At telephoto lens, and then watched it through field glasses until it finally disappeared as a tiny pin-point of light at about 9:00 P.M.

The most logical explanation, of course, is that it was a high-altitude research balloon, but even that theory leaves many unanswered questions:

1) Where did it come from, and why didn't the FAA know anything about it? An object so big that it can be seen at the same time in places 100 miles apart just can't be launched by some kid in his backyard.

2) Where did it go? It should have revealed itself somewhere over the Dakotas, and it would have been as hard to miss in their skies as it was in ours.

3) Neither observation through field glasses nor the photographs show anything on the instrument package or any kind of marking that I can just imagine would not do to a light-flying device in the middle of the night.

In short, can it be that our multi-billion dollar defense establishment can protect us from enemy bombers, rockets, and missiles--but leaves us wide-open to attack by balloons? Does none the word "never" reaches Havana?

Thank you.
Sincerely yours,

HIS BRIEFS (Continued): Among the reports received from the United States in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, there were no pictures, objects, or specimens of this mysterious object...At the Patuxent Air Force Base, it may have been a weather balloon, although a policeman and sheriff's officers were called to report a huge object as very high altitude.

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
25 July 1965

Dear Sir:
Regret for not having written sooner, but I have been out of the office for the past week and I am now just getting back to my normal routine.

With regards to your letter of 15 July, I will try to answer your questions as completely as possible.

The object, which you and your neighbors observed on 12 July, was a pressure research balloon. This balloon is an upper-atmospheric research balloon used to study cosmic rays and atmospheric conditions. It is 300 feet in diameter (measuring instrument package) and was approximately 120 feet high. It appears that this balloon was released in Canada by an industrial company who was conducting research for the U.S. Navy. I honestly don't know the answer to that one.

I need, etc. Your type or your description of the object, its motion, color, size, any other details you can provide, would be most helpful.

SINCERELY,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.

Maj. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Chief, Project Blue Book
FTD (TDEW)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Maj. Quintanilla,

Thank you very much for your letter of July 28, concerning the object seen in the Athens area on July 12. Although you probably considered the case closed by now, I have thought it might be of use to you in future sightings.

Were a following balloons found? It does sound credible that two 250-300 feet high radar targets--this object was obvious metallic--could be this "first" in an area so saturated with radar equipment.

Two further developments regarding the July 12 sighting which may be of interest to you:

1) A freelance photographer and former magazine editor--Ireno pts that he observed what was apparently the same object almost over Yellow Springs at about 8:30 p.m. At this time it appeared to be manuvering in a slow, erratic motion, so after watching it for approximately 10 minutes he went to his studio to get a telephoto lens with which to photograph it. However, when he returned to the area, the object had disappeared from sight.

2) Still puzzled by the fact that I had been working out-of-doors for some time prior to our original sighting of the object--in an area so close to where it was seen--I checked with the dispatchers of the local Ohio Highway Patrol, Athens County Sheriffs, and Athens Police Dept. Although they could not confirm definitely that they had observed the object, they stated that it was under investigation and they considered it under observation.

I estimated that it should have taken approximately 2 hours to move from the eastern horizon to the point of Athens where we first observed it.

From the telephone logs of these law enforcement agencies, however, I found that the initial calls to all three agencies had come in within 10 minutes of each other, at approximately 7:40-7:50 p.m.--and from then on they were swamped. Yet there were no apparent changes in weather conditions, light, etc. which could have accounted for the sighting being so concentrated.

Do you have any further questions on the rush of sightings in this area in early August?

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir:

On Wednesday night July 14th, my boss and my husband were night fishing on Horsehead Lake near Decoria, Michigan. Suddenly, one of them noticed an extremely bright object descending in the sky, which they described as looking like a "cosmic ray balloon."

Rather than beaming a spotlight, the men reported that it glowed.

We all hope that you find your missing balloons.

Transcription of the text in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 18 7 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

On July 8, 1965 at about 10:20 p.m. the witness was standing outside his house when he observed an object in the sky for about 2 to 3 minutes. The object was shaped like an inverted saucer and was about 8 to 10 feet in diameter and 3 to 4 feet thick. It had a glowing red light on one side, and as it moved it appeared to give off a bright light. The object moved in an erratic course at first, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The witness described the object as definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known object. He stated that while the sighting was brief, the object was very close and he had a good view of it. No sound was heard. The witness is a reputable person in the community and apparently is genuinely concerned about his sighting.

15 July 1965
MEMO TO: TDEW (Major H. Quintanilla)
FROM: TDFCC (Meteor) Wind data received by phone from 3WW (Mr. Hayes) in support of a balloon sighted drifting from the vicinity of Harrisburg, Pa. to Dayton, Ohio, 12-13 July 1965.

1. The mean flow for these two days in the region from Harrisburg to Dayton at 50,000 to 55,000 feet was from the Northwest between 280 degrees and 310 degrees at 30 knots. These data were obtained from inspection of analyzed data at the 100 millibar pressure level.

2. The mean flow obtained from the next higher pressure level, 50 millibars, is represented of the 55,000 to 70,000 layer:
a. On 12 July the flow was from the northeast, 030 degrees at about 10 knots.
b. On 13 July the flow veered to be more from the east, 070 degrees, at 10 knots.

3. The levels immediately above this layer would retain the same general direction but would have higher speeds. A speed of 50 knots or better could be maintained from 80-120,000 feet. Generally, the balloon speed along its trajectory is considerably less than any one reported speed.

13 July 65
Phil Donahue called from WHIO, Dayton, Ohio. Wanted information from Maj Quintanilla on sightings on night of 12 July 65. Informed him that it was high atmosphere balloon. Asked how do we substantiate the fact that it was a high atmosphere balloon. (1) PIOÇ's over Pennsylvania identified it as such. (2) Sulpher Grove Balloon launch personnel saw object at 8:20pm and identified it as upper air research balloon.
Phil Donahue wanted to come out here and take a 45 second film tape for television news on this subject. Major Quintanilla explained that this was not possible as permission had to be granted by the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Information in Washington, D C and this would take several days.

WGIC Radio from Xenia, Ohio called. Wanted information from Maj Quintanilla on sightings on night of 12 July 1965. Informed him that it was high atmosphere balloon and that we were still checking to see who launched. Sulpher Grove identified it was a balloon with instrument package.

Mr Al Morris at NCAR, Boulder, Colorado. No did they did not have any launched in that time. Could have been one of theirs. Last one was two months ago and was 18ft in diameter, traveling from East to West. There was one over the Azores on 9 Jul. We told him air weather service saw it from the ground.
Morris said that if they had seen it from a plane it would be about 40,000 ft it could have been theirs cause a balloon might have endured a second trip around.

Mr Reer, from Pittsburgh Information Officer at Pittsburgh, Pa. Said Air National Guards evaluation was a balloon. Told him it was a high altitude balloon, in accordance with AFS 200-2 he will send complete report paying particular attention to comments of personnel operating officers. His extension is 633.

13 Jul 65 call made to Goldanski, ONR, at the DOD, phone Liberty 5 - 6700, ext 64723, Office of Naval Research. They launch from Churchill, Canada. It was not their balloon, positive no. All theirs are accounted for. There's fly around 100,000 ft.

13 Jul 65 called Lockbourne AFB, 301st Intelligence, spoke with Colonel Patterson who said they had had some UFO activity and some reports. Put Lt Hender on phone to get Major Quintanilla's phone number etc. It was a Lt Taylor who handled reports. Hender's said they had no information on object, also he said he saw object for about ten minutes. They said that Lockbourne had not put up any jets to look for object.

At 1500 hours on 13 Jul 65 Major Stiles from SAFOI called. Major Quintanilla informed him that we have been trying to get through to him. It was his unfortunate experience to answer the phone since Sara was out because news agencies and Scrip Hover and others were asking about UFOs over Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Indiana. Major explained that one of the earlier observations at Davis, Ohio was a weather balloon seen at 65,000 ft. Other observations were a high altitude balloon with gondola. We have not found who launched this balloon, however we are continuing to research. Balloon launchers at Sulpher Grove said that it was an upper air research balloon with package, also F-102 pilots over Pittsburgh went up and observed the balloon with a gondola attached.

On 14 Jul 65 Mr Al Morris called from NORAD he had Mr Vince Lalloy in his office. Lalloy had a news clipping of the Azores, he thinks it was one of his balloons on its second go around. On 23 Jun 65 they launched a couple of unusual super pressures, balloons, to check out how stable they are, one was a conventional balloon 10,000 feet, tracked for a few days, another balloon was at around 6500 ft, two balloons tied together, 20 ft long 13 inches in diameter, they were just strapped together, looked & like one long cylinder, with payload, if it would have survived it would be at an altitude of 6000ft. In order to clarify, would have to find an observer who would say it was long, size of the balloon is not important, the change was good, the payload should be vertical, can we check this for NORAD. Lalloy will be flying from New Zealand on a project starting in September for 127 nations. He mentioned that the Air Force Cambridge Research Lab is flying things but won't tell. Should talk to a Tom Kelley 274-6100, ext 3013.
We talked to Cambridge Massachusetts again and they said no they didn't have any classified balloon projects at present and all balloons were accounted for.

Memo for the Record: 1220 received a call from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
He had talked to Colonel at Air National Guard and was referred to our office and wanted to know if we could give some information on UFO of this past week over Pittsburgh. Asked who he was: Hr Whitesell from national investigative committee on aerial phenomena. Told him to call Mr. Hunt in Washington. Wanted to know if we# would transfer the call. Told him Mrs Hunt was t# with the Secretary of the Air "orce office of Information in Washington D C and that the call could not be transferred. Told him they released all information on this phenomenon subject. He said he realized this in accordance with AFR 200-2, paragraph 9. He wanted to know if we were still investigating, told him that SAFOI was the release on all information. Sgt Jones told him that the Project Officer Major Quintanilla was out to lunch right now and would be back at 1pm. Sgt Jones said that he didn't know anything. Airman asked him, well what do you do, Sgt Jones said he answered the phone and typed up the reports and didn't know anything about these UFO reports. Whitesell said he would call back about 1pm for the Major.
Mr Whitesell called back and Major Quintanilla told him he was positive it was a balloon.

Called Mr Henry Deaboski, ONR on 16 Jul 65. They released four balloons on 5 Jul 65. Two of which they lost track on. 2.94/cm ft balloon beacon went out, tracked for five hours after launch. Launched at 0349 local and was seen over at Vancouver on 7 Jul, tracked visually until midnight, 104' W long 49.35°N latitude, drifting northwest 70 miles an hour. Other balloon, 10.6 million cu ft balloon launched at 0026, local was presumed down, because everything went out on balloon. It had been tracked visually for twelve hours.
2.94/cm ft Balloon.
These balloons were released by a contractor at Churchill, Canada. Left Churchill at 125,000 ft alt. The balloon is approximately 200 ft long, a parachute about 30 ft then another line 20 ft to payload, making total size approximately 250 to 300 ft extended. Lengths of strings is varied. The package carried was a sphere 5 ft diameter. Something may have gone wrong on the ducting. It is a Cosmic Ray Research Experiment and there is nothing classified on it. They fly from Churchill for it is the connection to the magnetic line, they project their balloons to the west. At first he didn't think it could be their balloon but after many many phone calls he feels there is a good probability of it being theirs. Doesn't understand why no one picked it up on radar as it had radar reflector on it. Of the four balloons launched on the 5th there are the only two not recovered. would appreciate getting it back, its a sophisticated package worth approximately $100,000.
Churchill is on Hudson Bay, 59° North latitude near Manitoba, Canada.

We are positive it is a balloon, however, additional confirmation can not be made unless the package from one of these two balloons is found.

Man From UFO: It Was Balloon

That mysterious sky object seen by thousands in Ohio and other states last week was a Navy balloon released in tests by the U.S. Weather Bureau, officials at Project Bluebook, the Air Force's investigative agency for unidentified flying objects, had previously identified the object as a balloon but were uncertain of the launching site.

NOW SAYS U.S.S.R. MADE BALLOON: The Weather Bureau says the balloons were released July 5 by the U.S. Weather Bureau for routine tests, and the size and shape approximated that of the two missing balloons. The balloons were normally fly at about 125,000 feet, it was said. The size of the larger one was about 250 feet tall, and it was valued at about $200,000. The also ones were reported seen by thousands of people, but later deemed a spotlighting on the ground.

Navy Balloon Is What You May Have Seen That Night
Two Indiana Navy balloon and three other states a week ago last night were spotted by thousands of witnesses, an official Air Force announcement said last night.
Col. David H. Wood, Jr. US. Army, Detachment commander at Chanute Air Force Base, said two or four balloons released June 3 from a Manitoba Manitoba manoeuvre are missing or may not have been recovered.
"We can't determine if the missing balloons were the objects seen that night," Wood said, "not until we recover the packages and their serial numbers." 
He explained that upward wind patterns can change balloon drift before positive identification can be made.
The four balloons used in the manoeuvre are valued at $100-$500 each, he said. They normally operate at altitudes from 70,000 to 125,000 feet and are programmed.

The text states:

UCHSTONES IN VERSE 
Officials Trip Over Selv
Trying to Identify Objec
Why is it that man refuses to believe 
in the unknown? Last Monday night, 
July 12, 1965, I believe I saw an object 
that man refuses to accept. The object 
was seen in four states according to 
the newspapers, of. I being
myself.
I was later told by the Air Force 
that it definitely was a balloon. Because 
of the altitude it was estimated at, it 
couldn't have been a balloon. It was 
estimated at the hundreds of feet in 
diameter.
A day later the Air Force then said 
it definitely was a balloon, but they 
didn't know where it came from. 
How definite is definite if one day 
they make a statement and the next
day they completely contradict them-
selves?
This incident, as you can see, must 
bear the full name and address of the 
writer. All names and addresses will 
be withheld from publication.
Readers: Are they trying to hide some-
thing from the public? It seems that 
way.
Then another official said it was 
the planet, Venus, but I say it was 
Venus since it moved east to west as 
planets do. Why did Venus then
move from east to west back to east?
It was repeated when the
night as similarly, another object was Sighted and it did these things.
Brains don't do these things.
It was a satellite. Its satellite's orbit
didn't altitude of only 80,000 feet. I
didn't see any satellite.
Finally, I saw the object through
my binoculars, which magnified it con-
siderably. Since when, at that altitude, . 
would a balloon show up so vividly 
and come! And it looked like a planet?
or even a star?
What can civilian would you call it?

SOURCE: SPRINGFIELD SUN AND NEWS, SPRINGFIELD, OHIO 14 & 15 JUL 65

Young Astronomers Think UFO Is Type Of Satellite
What is the round, glittering object that has been reported over Springfield? Members of "The Spotters," a ground astronomy group, feel it is probably a satellite and not a weather balloon.

The sighting is described in the article. The object was seen at 7:30 p.m. or so. It appeared to be in the sky for 20 to 30 minutes, sometimes stationary and sometimes moving. The astronomers and their scientific friends agree it is not an aircraft, satellite or balloon.

The article also mentions a "big balloon, air force says" incident in Dayton, Ohio, where a sighting was reported and confirmed by the Air Force. However, the Air Force is said to be puzzled by this incident for several days, until it was determined to be a weather balloon.

Flying Object, Seen Widely, May Be Satellite
A glittering, glowing object spotted over Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin yesterday was not a weather balloon, as was reported earlier, but more likely a satellite, according to the Federal Aviation Agency.

"The object, since the Tyler balloon was believed to have fallen, was spotted around 10:40 p.m. EDT and was described by observers as a glittering, glowing object. It was sighted over Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Columbus said it was a satellite."

Early speculation that it might be the 12-foot balloon satellite launched by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Sonic Laboratory in Pennsylvania and that it was re-entering the earth's atmosphere at the same time reports were coming in far to the west in Ohio were denied by the Weather Bureau.

The Weather Bureau said the object sighted was almost certainly a satellite. They said that several hundred sightings of the object were reported to them and that it was seen from several states.

The chief meteorologist at the Columbus Weather Bureau said it was a usual routine for the bureau to receive many reports through leases. Descriptions by others who watched the object were similar, he said, indicating it was the same object spotted in various locations.

Reports on the color varied widely, he said, ranging from white to orange, depending on where and whether it was day, dusk or night when it was sighted.

Area Residents Again Sight 
UFO In Skies Over Dayton

A bright object in the sky over which the National Investigation committee on Aerial Phenomena says it has received reports has again been sighted in the Miami Valley.

The unidentified object was spotted Tuesday night for many area residents, according to sources offered opinions on what it was.

Despite reports of the object and its published articles and television and radio statements, skepticism of unidentified objects being of extraterrestrial origin was increasing recently.

The sightings were reported to be increasing, especially in recent months, a spokesman for the Project Blue Book investigation said the office has not received any reports on sightings in the past two weeks.

"The Blue Book spokesman said that though there are occasional reports, there has been a gradual decline in the number of reports about objects in the sky over Dayton and surrounding areas in recent weeks."

The reports of the object, said to be about 70,000 feet in Ohio and neighboring states, are being investigated.

The image contains a photograph of a newspaper article titled "High Flying Object Identified By AF". The article discusses an unidentified flying object that was detected and investigated by the Air Force. According to the article, the Air Force has identified the object as a high-altitude balloon, and astronomy professors who investigated the object estimated its size to be 15 to 20 miles. The article also mentions that Air National Guard planes flew to the object over the search area and confirmed it was a large weather balloon with an instrument package in its tail.

DAYTON DAILY NEWS, 15 JUL 65

Mysterious Flying Object Balloon, Base Expert Says

A mysterious flying object, about the size of a small balloon, was definitely not a jet plane, an Air Force expert said today.

The object, seen Monday night, was definitely a high altitude balloon, said MAJ. QUINTANILLA of the Air Force Project Blue Book, a special agency for undentified [sic] Flying Object investigations.

He said the balloon was launched on the East Coast and drifted westward in Pennsylvania and Ohio. There were numerous sightings in this area.

MAJ. QUINTANILLA said the Air National Guard planes flew close enough to the balloon to determine that it was a high altitude balloon. 

The major said additional reports about the balloon would be gathered and confirmed.

DAYTON JOURNAL HERALD, 15 JULY 65

High Flying Object Identified By AF

The Air Force has identified a high flying object which was sighted in Ohio Monday night as definitely a high altitude weather balloon, an Air Force's investigative agency for unidentified flying objects (UFOs) said he thinks has found 'the culprit.'

He said the balloon came from the East Coast, probably and Air Force station.

He said only, "We think we've got the culprit."

College astronomy professors who investigated the object said it was a balloon and 15 to 20 miles high.

Air National Guard planes flew to the object over the search area and reported it was a big weather balloon with an instrument package in its tail.

Reports from residents in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and other areas indicates numerous sightings in this vicinity.

SPOTTED IN SEVERAL OHIO CITIES

Unidentified Flying Object
Has Switchboards Humming

By PERCY SMITH
An unidentified flying object
glimmered over Ohio yesterday -
and switchboards jammed with
calls from citizens in several
other cities.

SHORTLY, with the possible ex-
ception of the winona winters,
who once made a record-of-a-
kind accounts for the Air Force,
all kinds of citizens were calling
the cops.

THE SIGHTINGS came on
the heels of an Air Force an-
nouncement that it had picked
up an unidentified object over
Wright-Patterson Air Force base.

It does now, it seems, even
Lynchburge, O. -- a small Air
Force base at Columbus sent up
jets to get a closer look at the
object. The jets reached altitudes
of 60,000 and 50,000 feet.

"THE PILOT reported that he
could not get close enough to iden-
tify the object," said a base
spokesman. "The object was at
an altitude of 21,000 feet — the
highest he ventured to reach." 

Government agencies couldn't

agree on what the object, de-
scribed by a meteorological ad-
visory group as a "weather bal-
loon," might have been.

THE FEDERAL Aviation agen-
cy said it had no reports of any
unusual balloon in the skimmed
area.

LAST NIGHT the FAA in
Cincinnati said it, first thought
the object might have been a
weather balloon, but now they're
not so sure.

IT WOULD not comment further.

A spokesman at Dayton's
Wright-Patterson said the Air
Force had tracked the object over
that area, too, but described it as
a "tracking group" which traced
satellites for the government.

ORBIT ANALYST Friend
Hollstein said the object was
quite close, some 20-25 miles
within close range of the sun-
glasses he wears.

Officials at Wright-Patterson
told the Dayton Daily News they
had the object on their scope, but
they did not know what it was. 

They said they tracked it.

Sightings were reported over
Athens, Newark, Chillicothe,
Dover, Springfield and Hamilton.

Mrs. Fred Helmsman of 492
Harrison St., said her son, Terry,
18, spotted the object while he
was mowing the lawn.

"It seemed to stand still," she
said, "and then took off at a high
rate of speed." She said this was
about 4:30 p.m.

LATE this morning, Mrs.
M. L. Bouman of 3417 Catalpa
Dr., Dayton, called the Dayton
Daily News and the Air Force's
Project Blue Book at Wright-
Patterson to report she had seen
the object locally about 9 a.m.

The weather balloon was
released by the Atomic Energy
Commission at Miamisburg.

Mrs. Bouman said it was ac-
counted for several sightings about
6:25 a.m.

Project Blue Book at Wright-
Patterson said one of its technical
staff is investigating to see if it
was, indeed, a weather balloon.

20 IN 2 WEEKS

UFO Sightings
Up, Group Says

WASHINGTON, July 12—(UPI)—The National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena said last night that at least 20 so-called "flying saucer" sightings have been reported during the past two weeks, including some that were "unidentified flying objects."

A spokesman for the non-profit research organization said that at least 20 so-called "flying saucer" sightings have been reported during the past two weeks, including some that were "unidentified flying objects."

THE AIR FORCE, which keeps track of reported sightings, said it had no recent reports of increased UFO activity. A spokesman explained that UFO sightings reported in the past have turned out to be caused by natural phenomena, balloons or manmade objects, a spokesman said.

The Air Force added that because there is no definitive pattern to reports of unidentified flying objects, "they seem to be unreliable."

Richard Hall, NICAP director, countered the Air Force claims by saying "IT IS INTERESTING" that the Air Force is unable to find a pattern, "because it is staring them in the face."

On May 21, Hall said, a Japanese airline pilot reported seeing a UFO when it flew alongside his plane for 50 minutes, according to NICAP.

The pilot, Hall said, became alarmed when the UFO suddenly appeared at close range and affected the plane's air direction under control.

On Tuesday in Antarctica, British scientists reported sighting a UFO which sent back geometric instruments wild, Hall said.

He also said a day earlier electromagetic instruments had been reported watching at Santa Maria air port in the Azores shadowing for 15 minutes a UFO which was observed to come close and then suddenly accelerate and disappear from sight, "going like a bullet."

SIGHTING REPORT NO. 65-7432409
JULY 7, 1965
PENNSYLVANIA

On July 7, 1965, the following report was received by Project Blue Book:

On July 7, 1965, at approximately 2100 hours, the witness, Mr. John Doe, was driving on Route 15 near Altoona, Pennsylvania. He observed a bright light in the sky to the west. The light appeared to be stationary. 

The witness stopped his car and watched the light for approximately 15 minutes. During this time, the light appeared to dim and then brighten again. The witness stated that the light seemed to move slightly up and down, but remained basically stationary.

After 15 minutes, the light suddenly disappeared. The witness continued on his way and reported the sighting to the local police department.

A thorough investigation was conducted by Project Blue Book personnel. No further information or evidence was obtained. The case was classified as "Unidentified".
