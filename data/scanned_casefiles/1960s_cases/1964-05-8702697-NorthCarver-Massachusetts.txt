STATEMENT

3 May 1964

SUBJECT: Reported UFO

1. At approximately 0103Z, a Mr. [redacted] from North Carver called to report an UFO. He described the object as having 3 revolving beacons (as opposed to flashing or Grimes type), one red, one green and one blue. In addition to the this object, three (3) smaller ones in step formation trailed behind and had the same description as the larger item. This group was supposed to be moving slowly down the horizon until the smaller three (3) disappeared behind the trees. This formation was located SW of Carver. Mr. [redacted] reported during his initial call, he had observed this group (Estimated Altitude 5000'-6000') for 20 or 30 minutes and was sure they were not aircraft of any type he had ever seen. At 0202, the Base Operator was instructed to transfer the call to WOC. WOC divertech HOMEY 68 to the area in question, but aircraft did not note anything unusual. Mr. [redacted] called back and stated that the aircraft had flown between his [redacted] and the object's position. I asked him if the aircraft's rotating beacon was similar? He stated that the aircraft beacon was much smaller than the objects' lights.

Mr. [redacted] stated the object SW was still there and mentioned a second object due west of his position. (By this time, Mr. [redacted] had obtained a Navy compass). After the first call, we checked with Boston Search, Control Tower, RAPCON, etc., for possible information. Boston Search contacted State Police which in turn contact local police, who confirmed the objects but did not identify them. At 0152, I went to the Tower to observe for myself. The Tower then called an aircraft in Local area and asked if they would mind flying in the local area for any unusual sighting. The aircraft reported he could see nothing out of the ordinary. At 0252, Base Operations received another call from Mr. [redacted] catching that a second and third object, also in the same general area and confirmed by the police.

2. Other Factors:
a. Tower and Falmouth Police reported shooting star at 0030Z, 3 May.
b. There was a helicopter flying in vicinity of Carver (Tower had no contact with it) (Quonset verified all their helicopter were on the ground).
c. Several groups of stars and/or planets were visible low on the horizon at the approximate heading given by Mr. [redacted].

The document contains an index page with two main sections:

1. CONNECTICUT INDEX
- A multi-column list of what appears to be towns, cities, or locations in Connecticut
- The list is spread across three columns
- Each column contains numerous entries, though most are not clearly legible due to image quality

2. MASSACHUSETTS INDEX
- Similar to the Connecticut section
- A multi-column list of towns, cities, or locations in Massachusetts
- Spread across three columns
- Entries are also difficult to read due to image resolution

At the top of the page, there is also a small diagram or map with some lines and arrows, but the details are not clear.

The overall document appears to be a reference or indexing page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically page 10 of the file for a sighting in North Carver, Massachusetts in 1964.
