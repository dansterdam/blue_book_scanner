Dear Major Quintanilla,

On July 8, 1965 I noticed a "star" moving quickly past the "big dipper" from S.W. to N.E.

It took about fifteen minutes for it to pass the big dipper.

I'm sure my eyes weren't deceiving me because the night was clear and the stars were easily visible. Actually I've been writing you to report a satellite and I assumed this was what I had waited to see. My husband saw it, too.

give is that it looked like a
star.
Thank you for your time and
consideration. If you can tell

stations?

Sincerely yours,
Mrs. [redacted]
