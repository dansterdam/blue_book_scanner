PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP
10-11 APR 67 NIGHT

2. LOCATION
Houma, Louisiana

3. SOURCE
Civilian = Military

10. CONCLUSION
VISUALS: (INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION)
RADAR: (INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION)
This case is being re-evaluated as of 24 April 68 at which time it is too late to get needed data. Radar paints and visual observations do not seem to be related at all.

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
1, 3

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
On 10 April several witnesses sighted 3 lights that were star shape and were red, green and white in color. The objects slowly faded out to the north after about 40 minutes. Houma ARS was contacted and painted a single object at bearing roughly 277 deg, 12 miles out and between 23 and 27 thousand feet during this time. (There is no info to indicate that the radar paint was related in any way to the visual sighting, or how the radar paint disappeared if it did indeed disappear.)

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
1. 40 Minutes
2. All Night

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual & Radar

7. COURSE
Varied

8. PHOTOS
Yes
No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Yes
No

Following might be a circular object the size of a dime at arm's length that was white and occasionally red or green was sighted at azimuth of 100 deg. (The observers were two miles north of Houma Airport.) This light moved southward, then westward, and was visible all night. Sometimes during the night (time not stated) Houma was again contacted and again had paints at azimuth of 277 deg and 12 miles out. Again duration of paint and maneuvers, (if any) is not stated.

COMMENTS CONTD:

the paint disappeared, and reason why paint and visual were assumed to be the same object is not stated. Visual on 10 April lacks azimuth and angle of elevation with first seen and angle of elevation when last seen. Likewise on the following night it would be necessary to know the angle of elevation and azimuth of the object at several times in order to determine if the object was a star. Neither visual states if the light passed above or below cloud despite the fact that it was partially cloudy both nights.
