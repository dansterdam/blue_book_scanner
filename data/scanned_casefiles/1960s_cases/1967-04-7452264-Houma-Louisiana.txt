RADAR: (INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION)
This object was observed by several witnesses at Houma, Louisiana on 10 April 67 at which time it was in sight for about 20 minutes. It was described as an irregularly shaped, glowing, steady light at an elevation of about 10 degrees and varied in azimuth from 277 deg to 12 miles out. This light moved downward and forward, and then back to its original position during the time it was observed. The radar at Houma AFS was painting a single object at the same azimuth and distance as the visual sighting. Duration of radar contact is not stated.

OCR Output:
the paint disappeared, and reason why paint and visual were assumed to be range object is not stated. Visual on 10 April 1967 azimuth and angle of elevation when first seen and angle of elevation when last seen. Indicate on the following might it would be necessary to know the angle of elevation and azimuth of the object at several times in order to determine if the object was a star. Neither visual states if the light passed at or below cloud despite the fact that it was partially cloudy both nights.
