When the sun came out the observer saw a gleaming object. It looked strangely close as if it seemed to move along the side of her car for about four miles. Then the object seemed to cross the highway behind her and she continued watching it in her rear view mirror. There is an aluminum fence gate, some distance from the highway, that could have caught the sunlight and gave an unusual appearance.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, describing an observation of an unidentified object.

Text extracted from the document:

"Mrs. *** stated that she probably observed the object for a total of eleven minutes, including the time she watched it through her rearview mirror.

1. In response to the investigator's question concerning tail, trail, or exhaust, Mrs. *** stated, "There was no smoke or anything like that, and it was just moving along, making no noise."

2. Investigator's remarks: After the interview, I drove to the scene of the alleged sighting. Concerning the sighting Mrs. *** stated, fields on both sides were recently plowed, and there are scattered farmhouses and barns in this area. The highway runs perfectly straight for several miles. Mrs. *** said that she has driven on this stretch of highway several times a week. 

3. I instructed an Investigator at an Irrigation Equipment Company on the highway in the vicinity of the sighting, and personnel at the said that they had seen nothing unusual.

4. I stopped at a farmhouse occupied by the Sofolk family. Mrs. *** said that this family had been outside at approximately 10:45 Sunday morning admiring newly-born twin calves, and nothing unusual was seen or heard. He said that they remained outdoors for sometime and that the children had a baseball game within 20 yards of the highway. 

d. The only unusual observance made by the investigator was an aluminum fence gate, some distance from the highway, that appeared to have newly risen from the ground. This stretch of highway was with the area of freshly plowed fields, which together with the rising sun, gave an unusual appearance."

REPLY TO 
ATTN OF:   ODM

SUBJECT:   UFO Follow-Up Report

TO:         AFSC (FTD)
            Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio 45433

1. This is the follow-up report on UFO sighting reported by our ODM 00305 April 1966.

a. Pertinent data on observer:
(1) Mrs. [redacted]
Box [redacted]
Millersview, Texas
Phone: 23

(2) When Mrs. [redacted] works late, she stays in San Angelo with her aunt and uncle at 206 Robin Hood Trail.

(3) One month ago, Mrs. [redacted] began work for General Telephone Company as a telephone operator trainee.

(4) Marital status: Mrs. [redacted] is presently obtaining a divorce from her husband. He is employed as an electronics engineer with R. K. Black, Inc., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

b. In reply to a question regarding travel in the U.S. and abroad, Mrs. [redacted] stated that she has always lived in this area, but has traveled in Oklahoma and Colorado.

When asked to relate what happened on the morning of the 17th, Mrs. [redacted] replied as follows: "I had to go to work on Sunday morning. I left home earlier than usual to come into San Angelo. The sun was behind the clouds when I left. I was traveling on Farm Road 765, towards Highway 87 and San Angelo. Just after I passed the crossroads of the sign that said "San Angelo, 13 Miles", I looked at my watch. It was right after that that I saw the object."

OCR output:

a... When asked what caught her attention, Mrs. said: "I looked out at the clouds, which were a dark blue, to see what we were going to do, and the thing came in." The first thing she saw was a flash, and it gleamed - it was moving along beside me, on the right. At a distance of about 70 yards." She estimated that she was traveling at a speed of about 65 miles per hour. She added that the object slowed down, and the change in speed was instantaneously. Mrs. said that the object was parallel with her car, at a distance of about 4 miles, or quite awhile. She said that she had observed airplanes, helicopters, and what balloonlike objects in the past, but that she had never seen anything like this, and, she explained, that it was difficult for her to get a good look at it.

2. When asked to describe the object, Mrs. stated, "It was completely round, but probably bluimp-shaped or oval." There was something in the back, sort of a halo, circulating and something on the bottom. She did not know if it was an aerial, or serials, or what, but that there was something going on top. She stated that it glittered, that it was either silver or perhaps just metal. She did not remember anything about the bottom of the object. She did state that its size was about that of a Volkswagon. It was not like anything I have ever seen before. I do not believe it to be anything foreign - I know there must be an explanation for it."

3. When queried whether or not object had windows or doors, Mrs. stated that she did not see any.

4. Asked how the object disappeared, Mrs. said that she did not see it disappear. She stated that it slowed down to about 40 MPH when it was about 1/4 mile distant, and it continued on the right." The object then crossed the highway "right beside her, pretty close to her than it had been in the field. She continued, "It was about as high off the ground as one ordinary house. It moved to the field on the opposite side of the highway." When the object did that, it seemed to heighten and continued at about 35 MPH. The object then disappeared from a distance in my rearview mirror on the side of my car, but I did not see it disappear."
