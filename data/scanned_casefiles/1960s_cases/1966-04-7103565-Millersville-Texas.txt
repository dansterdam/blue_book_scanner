11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
When the sun came out the observer saw a gleaming object. It looked strange and awfully close. It seemed to move along side of her for about four miles. Then the object seemed to cross the highway behind her and she continued watching it in her rear view mirror.
There is an aluminum fence gate, some distance from the highway, that could have caught the sunlight and gave an unusual appearance.

h. Mrs. stated that she probably observed the object for a total of eleven minutes, including the time she watched it through her rearview mirror.

i. In reply to the investigator's question concerning tail, trail, or exhaust, Mrs. stated, "There was no smoke or anything like that, and no moving parts. It was just moving along, making no noise."

j. Mrs. comments on the weather at the time of the observance were as follows: "It was very cloudy. It was raining and hailing when I left Millersville; however, it was not raining when I saw the object. It quit raining before I got to Eola, about 8 miles out of Millersville. Eola is about 20 miles from Goodfellow AFB. The sun came out just after I saw it, and it gleamed."

2. Investigator's remarks:

a. After the interview, I drove to the scene of the alleged sighting on either side of the highway. The terrain is absolutely flat for miles on either side of the highway. The fields on both sides were recently plowed, and there are scattered farmhouses and barns in this area. The two-lane, paved highway runs perfectly straight for several miles. Mrs. Groves, a native of this area, stated that she drove over this stretch of highway several times a week.

b. I inquired at an Irrigation Equipment Company on the highway in the vicinity of the sighting, and personnel there said that they had seen nothing unusual.

c. I stopped at a farmhouse occupied by the Scfolk family. Mr. said that his family had been outside at approximately 10:45 Sunday morning admiring newly-born twin calves, and nothing unusual was seen or heard. He said that they remained outdoors for sometime and that the children had a baseball game within 20 yards of the highway.

d. The only unusual observance by the investigator was an aluminum fence gate, some distance from the highway, that caught the sunlight and gave an unusual appearance. This stretch of highway is in an area of freshly plowed fields, which, together with the heat waves rising from the ground, give a great mirage effect.

e. Mrs. appears to be a highly excitable person, possibly due to her pending divorce, training for a new position with the Telephone Company, living with her parents,

along with her three-year old son, and having to drive
ninety miles to and from work each day.

f. I can find no valid explanation for this alleged
sighting. This is the final report unless further in-

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: ODM

SUBJECT: UFO Follow-Up Report

TO: AFSC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio 45433

1. This is the follow-up report on UFO sighting reported by our ODM 00305 April 11, 1966.

a. Pertinent data on observer:
(1) Mrs. [redacted]
Box [redacted]
Millersville, Texas
Phone: [redacted]
Age: 23

(2) When Mrs [redacted] works late, she stays in San Angelo with her aunt and uncle at 206 Robin Hood Trail.

(3) One month ago, Mrs [redacted] began work for General Telephone Company as a telephone operator trainee.

(4) Marital status: Mrs [redacted] is presently obtaining a divorce from her husband. He is employed as an electronics engineer with R. K. Black, Inc., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

b. In reply to a question regarding travel in the U.S. and abroad, Mrs [redacted] stated that she has always lived in this area, but has traveled in Oklahoma and Colorado.

c. When asked to relate what happened on the morning of the 17th, Mrs [redacted] replied as follows: "I had to go to work Sunday morning, so, since it was hailing and raining in Millersville, I left home earlier than usual to come into San Angelo. The sun was behind the clouds when I left. Driving in, the land is very level. There are fields after fields, and you can see for miles. I was traveling on Farm Road 765, toward Highway 87 and San Angelo. Just after I passed the crossroads of [redacted] and [redacted] and the sign that said 'San Angelo, 13 Miles'", I looked at my watch. It was right after that that I saw the object."

d. When asked what caught her attention, Mrs. said, "I looked out at the clouds, which were a dark blue, to see what the weather was going to do, and I saw it. It looked strange to me and awfully close. The sun came out and it gleamed. It was moving along beside me, on the right, at a distance of about 70 yards." She estimated that she was traveling at a speed of about 65 miles per hour. She noted that she slowed down, and the object kept moving, just slightly ahead or her and at about the same speed. Mrs. added that the object was parallel with her for a distance of about 4 miles, or quite awhile. She said that she had observed airplanes, helicopters, and weather balloons in this area for years, but that she had never seen anything like this; and she explained, that it was close enough for her to get a good look at it.

e. When asked to describe the object, Mrs. stated, "It was not completely round, but probably blimp-shaped or oval. There was something in the back, sort of like a cork, protruding, and something on the top." She could not identify what it was on top. She did not know if it was an aerial, or aerials, or what; but that there was something on top. She started that I glittered, that it was either silver or perhaps just metal. She did not remember seeing anything on the bottom of the object. She added, "The object seemed smaller a regular car; but perhaps a little larger than a Volkswagen. It was not like anything I have ever seen before. I do not believe it to be anything foreign, I know there must be an explanation; something down-to-earth."

f. When queried whether or not object had windows or doors, Mrs. stated that she did not see any.

g. Asked how the object disappeared, Mrs. said that she did not see it disappear. She stated, "I slowed down to a speed of 35 or 40 MPH when I saw it and continued driving for about 4 miles with the object parallel to me on the right. The object then crossed the highway right behind her, pretty close, closer to her than it had been in the field. She continued, "It was about as high off the ground as a one-story house. It moved to the field on the opposite side of the highway. When the object did this, I became frightened and came on at a speed of about 85 MPH. I continued to watch the object for a distance in my rearview mirror on the side of my car, but I did not see it disappear."
