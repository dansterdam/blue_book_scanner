16 March 1961
West Australia

P.J.Young Weir, Australia ir... this object gave her three round lights travelling slowly in a curved path. She said it slowed down and disappeared from her sight. It moved sideways in a jerking manner, before it disappeared into the air in the evening darkness.

No Case (Information Only)
17 March 1961
Witt, Illinois

Was Montgomery County Visited By Flying Saucer?
A natural or man-made object over the Mill home as he was approaching the home. Then the object seemed to be suspended over the hill for a minute before it was lost from sight. The object was estimated to be 150 to 200 feet long, and 30 to 40 feet wide. They described it as metallic or aluminum in color and they thought it was a shooting star, then a ball of fire, and then it seemed to be in their car. The object was reported to the authorities by Mrs. Heath and Mr. Ray Heath. Mr. Heath is a retired farmer and his grandfather said that long ago they watched such an object when he was a young man. They were much interested and amazed at the object. They tried to get a better look at it, but it disappeared. A short distance from their home the object appeared in the sky. They watched it for several miles as it traveled at a very high rate of speed. Then it seemed to disappear. Mrs. Hennie McBride of Hillsboro, said that an unidentified flying object was sighted in that area sometime last year which was also reported to authorities.

Unidentified Flying Object Spotted Also In East Hillsboro
A third person called me (the writer) today to report an unidentified flying object which was spotted by several persons in the area of East Hillsboro between 5 and 5:30 p.m. on March 16, 1961. This object was also reported to the Montgomery County Sheriff's office. It was estimated to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, cigar-shaped, and was observed for about 8 to 10 minutes as it hovered over the rural area. A number of people watched it until it finally disappeared from sight.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old government report or document. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

LOS ANGELES, MARCH 1961
THE OBJECT WHICH WAS FIRST SIGHTED OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN, ABOUT 10 MILES OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, BY A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY AND HIS 13-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, BELIEVED TO BE ALUMINUM OR CHROMIUM-PLATED, SILENT AND STATIONARY, REMAINED IN VIEW FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. IT THEN MOVED AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED BEFORE DISAPPEARING. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO BE OVAL OR CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND ESTIMATED TO BE 30 TO 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS LOCATED ABOUT 1,000 FEET ABOVE THE HORIZON AND DISAPPEARED RAPIDLY BEFORE IT REACHED THE HORIZON. THE OBJECT ALSO HAS SIGHTED BY A MAN IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter from the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) addressed to Major William T. Coleman of the Department of the Air Force Office of Information, dated August 23, 1961.

Here is the text from the document:

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON, D. C.
August 23, 1961

Major William T. Coleman
Department of the Air Force
Office of Information
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Coleman:

Thank you for your letter of August 28 promising to advise us of the Air Force conclusion in the May 30 sighting.

Considering the location of the June 2 sighting, it appears that the white object could have been the same one viewed by several persons on the Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. She reported a cigar-shaped UFO accompanied by several smaller objects.

At first all objects were motionless, then the smaller ones moved around the larger and all of them were observed at close range in a brilliant afternoon, and the objects were visible in the NE sky.

We would appreciate a check on the conclusion of the May 30 sighting. You may recall the large bright light which was observed up and down the Atlantic coast for a considerable distance. A follow-up report mentioned a bright light which accelerated and moved rapidly southward.

According to the record, the missile fired from Vandenberg at 9:14 P.M. was not observed in this area. Can you clarify this?

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
Secretary of NICAP

31 August 1961

Dear Mr. X,

I have passed the information you forwarded in yours of August 29th to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center (Blue Ridge Military Division).

The March 29th sighting you refer to was probably a Thor Intercontinental Ballistic Missile which was launched at Cape Canaveral on that date. As you know, the Thor is the booster for the Agena vehicle. The discovery is in the Air Force program as an IRBM, now deployed in England and manned by the RAF.

I hope this clarifies the situation.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir: 

Enclosed is a photo from our files of a seemingly material and probable highly charged "object" over Japan.

In reference to your "Garland HAFB" photo, we would wish to ask this question? What provision is separate this type can you make on your COC for wider and more comprehensive analysis, which might perhaps you impress, and assist in terms, with which would produce greater detailed attention from the COC to AAHATRON, Chromes, and the Pentagon?

Thank you once again for your detailed reply.

Transcribed text:

6 MAY 1964

HELEN,

This letter has to do with what paragraph 9, Apr 2001 has to do with. It is not asking about the identity of an UFO. He is not asking about the identity of an UFO. He is asking about identifications used in the Command Post. He is not asking about the identity of an UFO, although this is just a guess.

By the way, our file on this gentleman contains seven pieces of correspondence. This is the first time he has used this type of letter-head. This is other letters he has written to us in the past. In 1955 he was published in 1968. Please return it when you are finished so we can keep it on file.

I would not answer this letter from the UFO stand point, because it might precipitate a flow of letters from this man requesting information, which may not be justified, because it might be mistaken for an invitation.

1. The attached letter is returned to your Headquarters without action. This Headquarters does not have all available UFO information.

2. This organization has as its purpose the exploitation or UFO reports. This Headquarters is not equipped to handle the details in articles by or about persons reportedly voyaging to other planets. The organization is also very anti the USAF UFO program.

3. I SHOULD desire to explain command post procedures. Any reply to Mr. Allsn's letter should come from that Headquarters.
