1

8. COURSE
170°

11. COMMENTS
Obj was sighted by aircrew of 3 a/c who were in general area, but were separated by several mi. Obj did not appear to be moving at an exceedingly high rate of speed, which was probably due to right moving in almost same direction. Reentry of satellite 1961 Epsilon 2. Observed between 30 Mar 61 and 2 Apr 61. Color and appearance of reentry along with 170° heading indicated reentry. Slowness of obj indicated probable reentry rather than fireball. Case listed as reentry of 1961 Epsilon 2.

[The text of the first article is partially illegible, but I can make out portions of the text describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object near Witt, Illinois. The article mentions someone driving on Route 16, seeing an object, and attempting to get a better look at it.]

[The second article also discusses an unidentified flying object sighting, mentioning Mrs. Rosie McLean and other residents of Hillsboro who reported seeing a strange object.

At the bottom of the document, there appears to be a handwritten note, but it is not fully legible.

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Coleman:

Thank you for your letter of August 25 promising to advise us of the Air Force conclusion in the May 20 Tyndall AFB case.

Considering the location of the June 4 sighting, I assume the Air Force would have other reports on the sighting. One witness whom you may wish to contact was Mrs. Blue Ridge Summit, Penna. She reported a cigar-shaped UFO accompanied by several smaller "satellite" objects, visible about ten minutes. At first all objects were motionless, then the smaller ones sped toward the large object and all of them were obscured by trees in the foreground. This was early afternoon, and the objects were visible in the NE sky.

We would also like to check on the conclusion for the March 29, 1961 sighting near Lemoore Naval Air Station, Hanford, California. According to press wire reports, several highway patrolmen sighted a large bright light which was westward and headed toward a high speed, A follow-up story quoted the AF as saying the object was a Discoverer satellite fired from Vandenberg at 9:14 p.m. According to N.A.S.A. records the Discoverer XXII was not launched until the following day at 5:25 p.m. (EST.)

Can you clarify this?

Sincerely yours,
Secretary of NICAP

31 August 1961

Dear Mr.

I have passed the information you forwarded in yours of August 28th to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center (Blue Ridge Summit sighting).

The March 29th sighting you refer to was probably a Thor Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile which was launched at 2114 Pacific Standard Time by a Royal Air Force team. A Discoverer was launched the following day. As you know the Thor is the booster for the Agena vehicle. The Discoverer is an Air Force program as well as the Thor 1854, now deployed in England and manned by the FAF.

I hope this clarifies the situation.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a photo from our files of a seemingly material and perhaps highly charged "object" over Japan.

In reference to your "Command Post" NORAD photo in the enclosure referred above we would wish to ask this question:

What provision to separate this type of "phenomena" from the documentary of an "enemy" target can you make on your COC grid? Could you indicate any "procedures" or directives which would preclude you from sending an implement which give from the COC to Washington, Ottawa and the Pentagon?

Thank you once again for your detailed reply.

Very truly yours,

Please return enclosure after evaluation.... CBA #1 copy-right photo

6 May 1964

HELEN,

This file is sort of screwy to me. In the first place, I don't know what paragraph 8, AFR 200-2 has to do with what the man is asking. The man is asking about procedures used in the Command Post. He is not asking about the identity of an UFO. I'd send this letter right back to Major Freudential and let him answer it, although I'm sure the process here's a asking about a classified, I'm just guessing.

By the way. Our file on this gentleman contains seven pieces of correspondence. The latest was in 1960. He owns a number of radio stations. This is the first time he's used this type of a letter-head. His other letter heads were not quite as impressive. I'm sending you a copy of his Space Digest which he published in 1953.

Please return it when you are finished so we can keep it on file.

I would rather not answer this letter from the UFO stand point, because it might precipitate a rash of letters from this man's organization. From 1958 - 1960 Mr Allen carried a running feud with Major Tucker on the subject of gravitation.

1. The attached letter is returned to your Headquarters without action. The Air Force has a large file of letters from this organization and has previously furnished them with all available UFO information. This Headquarters does not intend to respond to this inquiry.

2. This organization has as its purpose the exploitation of UFO reports. A digest is published which not only details flying object sightings but also prints science-fiction articles by or about persons purportedly voyaging to other planets in space ships. The organization is also very anti the USAF UFO program.

3. If NORAD desires to explain Command Post procedures, then an answer to Mr. Allen's letter should come from that Headquarters.
