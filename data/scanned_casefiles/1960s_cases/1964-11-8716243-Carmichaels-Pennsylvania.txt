Dear [redacted]:

Thank you for your letter of 26 January 1965 and the box with the "patches" of material. The material which you found and sent to me is "chaff" or military radar window. It was discovered in the vicinity of a radar station. This is done to confuse the Radar Operators so that they can penetrate the Radar Defense. Evidently, they must have had a radar exercise in your area and the wind may have blown this material onto your farm. We wish to thank you for calling this chart to our attention.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr.
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch

In Nov of 1964 while hunting small game we noticed some "patches" of this same material scattered over a wide area of our farm. I have kept this in view, then wondering where to send it.

Please send reply in regard to your findings as it will be appreciated.

Sincerely Yours

[The signature is blacked out]
