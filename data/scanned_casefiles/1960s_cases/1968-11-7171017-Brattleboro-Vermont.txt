Dear Sir,

I wrote to Dr. Condon at the University of Colorado November ninth about U.F.O. sightings but the project office is closed.

He sent me your address.

This is not a report of an individual sighting such as anyone may have. They appear in such numbers and so frequently anyone can see them.

Apparently they congregate here.

in Southern Vermont because
the mountains keep one radar
from finding them. They also keep
low. They fly up and down and
sideways. They make no sound.

One large U.O. had a white
light in the center, blue lights on
top and red lights on the bottom.

Another I watched, flew from
the north, along the western horizon
then toward the south. It was
some shaped much a circle of lights
which remained in a circle as it
slowly flew with no sound.

Wednesday the 27th driving up Court
Street toward the First National
Shopping Center there was a large
white U.O. I merely hung in

Great shaft of white light
Distinct the sky lighting up that
area.

My sister [blacked out] and her
daughter have made several
sightings of flying saucers
during the last twelve years.

But during the last six months
the U. S. has have become much
more numerous and all new of
a more sophisticated design.

We feel that we are under
constant surveillance. Twice I'm
sure a small red one followed
me.

the sky like a star. It was
5 P.M., not quite dark, the
parking lot was filled with cars
and plenty of people shopping
for Thanksgiving. My sister, niece,
and I looked at it. But nobody
else even glanced at it.

After shopping, we drove to
Guilford Center where my sister
lives. There were two more U.S.
The way they converge in
Guilford, I suspect to their home
base.

One evening when I drove out,
Guilford there were four red U.S.
Three lies appeared. The fourth flew
a short way further south and
apparently landed.

I know there is a camera that
will take a picture up to a mile
in the sky in great detail. I
have no pictures to send you.
Therefore you have only my word
for it. I wish someone would
investigate. It might be important
to our national defense or space
program.

Sincerely,
