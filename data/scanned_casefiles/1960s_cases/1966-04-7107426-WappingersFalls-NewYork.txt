I feel that aircraft might possibly account for some of these sightings, but certainly not all.

Mrs. [redacted] reports having seen many UFO's every night, except 2 or 3, since 31 March 1966. The objects appear to be red lights and follow a smooth flight path while changing attitudes. They fly at various altitudes and follow various flight paths, appearing in all quadrants from the observers home; several flying in the same area simultaneously but not in formation.

On the evening of 25 April at approximately 2130L, Mrs. [redacted] went up the hill behind her house to a point 1/2 mile, straightline distance, from the observers home. Attached is the observer's sketch of the object seen and another drawing of the general area showing the locations of other objects seen simultaneously. The object which she saw on 25 April 1966 was about the size of a Volkswagon car at the 150 foot range.

L. Physical Evidence: Attached are two drawings made by the observer of the object seen at close range on the night of 25 April and of the location of his and four other objects seen simultaneously and their positions relative to the observer.
