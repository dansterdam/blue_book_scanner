k. Assistant Base Operations Officer; 809th Cmbt Spt Gp,
F.E. Warren AFB, Wyo.

Mr [redacted] had called the FAA Tower Personnel immediately after
sighting the alleged UFO. Coordination with the local FAA personnel
revealed nothing significant. They had not seen the alleged UFO.
They had no knowledge of aircraft in the area at the time.

I believe Mr [redacted] saw a meteor (see a.(9) above) or the rays of the
sun may have created an illusion on the base of the clouds at 20,000 feet
(see para g. above).
