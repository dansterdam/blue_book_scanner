PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP
25 May 1966 25/0320Z

2. LOCATION
Mobile, Alabama (1 Witness)

3. SOURCE
Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
Astro (MOON) Probable

Five

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Objects appeared in conjunction with 5 white cotton ball objects that had pink cast about them. Moon was not visible during sighting, but became visible the instant the objects disappeared.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
50 Minutes

It appears that a combination of atmosphere conditions (scattered clouds, lights wind and possibly some smoke from the paper mill) caused partial blackout of the quarter moon from the observers location. As the cloud mass moved, moonlight shining through varying cloud densities may have caused the phenomena.
