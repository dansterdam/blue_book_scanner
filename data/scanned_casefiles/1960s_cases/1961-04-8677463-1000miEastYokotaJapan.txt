Unidentified Object

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative text on AF Form 112a
unless report can be fully stated on AF Form 112 List inclosures, including number of copies)

Pan American Airways Aircraft AN-779 FA encountered unidentified object at 31,000 just west of Wake Island to Yokota
Yokota AB. Object suddenly appeared on right wing, took bearing fusing an eight landing light. Aircraft landed at Yokota 0447 & 26 April. Damage consist-
ed of cracked left wing assembly forward spar station 16 and bent fairing assembly station 12 to 75.

The undersigned inspected the aircraft upon its arrival at Travis AFB at 0620 27 April. 1st Officer stated that there was not any break in the skin of the aircraft. The dented leading edge of the wing at the point of contact with the object had been covered with a 3 x 4 (feet) sheet of aluminum. There was no minor damage on the wing landing light fairing. The crew members aboard with the aircraft at the time of contact were the pilot, co-pilot, and
1st with crew chief.

It is probable that the aircraft may give more contact with a naval, coast re-
garded by the USA as United Island & Toku Island and Tok.
