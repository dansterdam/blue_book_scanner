34. Date you completed this questionnaire: February 1965
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
21.From what I saw, this object seemed to be very high up. 
It looked as high, or higher, than an airplane would go.
The objects were small, much smaller than an airplane would be, but the brightness made the object noticeable.
The brightness of the object could or teen caused by the sun reflecting against it. But it is possible, also, that the object gave off its own light. These objects were directly above me. I had to look up in order to see them. I am not sure how many objects there were. I think there were about ten at the most. The way they flew was strange. They would stop in mid air at times. When I first saw these objects, they didn't want to leave the area they were in, but still they were moving. They would turn around and go back and forth, but each one had a path of its own. After a while, these objects started to leave the area, all heading in the same direction.
I have never seen anything like these objects before.

The image contains a compass-style diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this particular page.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.
90*    75*
60*
50*         43*
30*     20*

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 666 35
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I don't remember how they were fired, but
