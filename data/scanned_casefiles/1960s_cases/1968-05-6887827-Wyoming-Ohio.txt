8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Probable (BALLOON)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:

The observer reported to the Duty Officer that he had sighted an object that appeared as a bright red flashing light. It first appeared over the G. E. Plant at Evendale; then appears as two bright red flashing light directly overhead, and at this time, yellowish-red torch like lights appeared to fall from the object. The object suddenly disappeared.

COMMENTS: Except for the duration, the description sounds exactly like that of a garnet bag hot air balloon. Form 117 returned 16 Sept 68. The wind at almost all levels was blowing SE.

TUESDAY, MAY 14, 1968

The rest of the text is illegible or too blurry to read clearly. The image appears to be a technical diagram or map with contour lines, possibly a meteorological or topographical chart, with some small dot-like markings scattered throughout.


- page 3 -

The text I can discern in this image is:

TOP (in the top section)
HIGH (in the bottom section)

The rest of the image appears to be technical diagrams or charts with contour lines, grid patterns, and what seem to be meteorological or topographical maps. The text is very minimal and partially illegible.


- page 4 -

WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 1968

The rest of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric map with contour lines, pressure systems, and various markings, typical of a weather chart from that era.


- page 5 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

HIGH
LOW
HIGH

At the bottom of the main chart, there is partially legible text that appears to say:
"CONSTANT HEIGHT CONTOURS"

The document appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric chart with curved contour lines and some annotations, but much of the smaller text is too blurry to definitively transcribe.

The rest of the text appears to be too small or blurry to confidently transcribe. The document appears to be a complex diagram or chart with curved lines, concentric circles, and numerous small markings or notations.


- page 7 -

The text in this image is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and faded nature of the document. The only clearly readable text I can see are the labels "HIGH" in multiple locations on the page. The document appears to be a meteorological or geographical map with contour lines, circular patterns, and scattered markings, but the specific details are not clear enough to transcribe accurately.


- page 8 -

The text I can clearly read is:

At the bottom right of the page: "EDITION 21 MAY 1968"

The rest of the image appears to be a complex diagram or map with contour lines, circular patterns, and numerous small markings/notations, but the text within those markings is too small or blurry for me to confidently OCR.


- page 9 -

I apologize, but I cannot discern any legible text in this image. The document appears to contain three sections with different types of diagrams or charts:

1. The top left section seems to have a dotted or scattered pattern
2. The top right section contains contour-like curved lines forming concentric shapes
3. The bottom section has more scattered dots and curved lines

The image looks like it could be a scientific or meteorological chart, possibly showing topographical or atmospheric data, but without clear text to transcribe.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAY 27-JUNE 2, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map.

An explanatory sheet is available, and may be obtained by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m.e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

FIRST CLASS MAIL

[The rest of the text is either too faint or at an angle that makes it difficult to read clearly. There appears to be a diagram or chart on the right side of the top section of the document, but the text within it is not legible.]


- page 17 -

The text I can clearly read on this document is:

Bottom right: MONDAY, MAY 27, 1968
Bottom left: SKYMAP

The rest of the document appears to be a map or chart with curved lines, contour lines, and various markings, but the text within those markings is too small or blurry to read definitively. There are some numbers and letters scattered throughout the map, but I cannot make out their specific content with confidence.


- page 18 -

The text I can clearly read on this document includes:

HOH (appears multiple times)
NOT
H (in various locations)
11 (appears multiple times)
7 (appears multiple times)

The document appears to be a technical diagram with contour lines, curved lines, and various numerical and text annotations. The image looks like a topographical or meteorological map with curved lines representing some form of data or terrain. However, much of the smaller text is too blurry or faint to definitively read.


- page 19 -

The image appears to be a topographical or contour map with various curved lines representing terrain or elevation. There are numerous small markings scattered across the map, which look like symbols or notations. Some areas are labeled with numbers like "#407" and "#408". The map has curved boundary lines and seems to represent a specific geographic area. At the bottom of the image, there is text that appears to be partially cut off, but the last line reads "TUESDAY, MAY 1968".


- page 20 -

The text I can discern in this image is very limited:

Visible text fragments:
- "H" (appears multiple times as labels)
- "MOI" (in bottom section of image)

Most of the image appears to be technical diagrams with curved lines, contour-like markings, and numerical/alphabetical labels. The image looks like a scientific or geological chart with multiple sections, but the text is mostly illegible or too small to read clearly.


- page 21 -

The image appears to be a complex scientific or meteorological chart/map with contour lines, various markings, and annotations. Some legible text includes:

H
H1
H16

MOT

The bottom right of the image has text that appears to read "WEDNESDAY AVG 700 MB" (though it is partially inverted/upside down).

The chart contains numerous curved lines, small dot-like markings, and seems to represent some kind of atmospheric or geographical data visualization. The details are intricate but much of the smaller text is too blurry to definitively read.


- page 22 -

The image appears to be a technical document with multiple panels containing various maps or charts with contour lines, grid patterns, and numerical annotations. The text is mostly illegible due to the low resolution and faintness of the writing. The only clearly readable words are "HIGH" and "LOW" on the bottom right panel. The document seems to be a meteorological or geographical analysis chart with complex line drawings and numerical data points.

OTHER

18. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE PHENOMENON:
(Some handwritten text that is partially illegible, appears to read something like):
See #9 - I did tell to Cincinnati Police Control while at the station and they were able to pick up the object 12 miles away. It was with us all the night flying. I was able to point out its location, some distance to west to expand during the sighting. During a subsequent phone conversation with the family, they said someone else in the vicinity of Mt. Washington or Ludlow, right also saw lighting. This was 12 miles from where I was.

19. DO YOU USE READING GLASSES? [YES] [NO]

20. IN ORDER THAT WE MAY OBTAIN AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, DESCRIBE IN YOUR OWN WORDS COULD YOU DRAW A PICTURE OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY, SIMILAR TO WHERE YOU NOTED THE PHENOMENON, WOULD GIVE A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF ITS GENERAL SHAPE, BRIGHTNESS, COLOR, SIZE, AND WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SAW.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                16 SEPTEMBER 1969

Subj: Reference UFO Observation of 31 May 69, Ohio.

12 September 1969: Colonel Lewis called to say that he had finally completed his form and was going to send it to us or bring it down to the office. He also wanted to know what we had found out about his sighting. I said that I didn't remember it. Colonel Lewis gave some of the details over the phone. Of particular interest was the fact that he was located quite close to the Boone Co. Airport and called them at the time of the sighting. They did not paint the object, none of the incoming aircraft reported it, the tower personnel couldn't see the lights either. Colonel Lewis will probably call back Monday, 16 August 1963.

The handwritten text reads:

"I personally felt the lights I saw were to steady, not flickery, to be caused by some sort of reflection phenomenon, or a balloon.

Also to distinct and maneuvering to be a flare.

My impression is the color of incandescent lamps. Brightness (at first) brighter than plain incandescent bulbs at that distance, but not as bright as I would expect a searchlight lamp(s) would be, ground horizon.

Fly lighting was not noticeably erratic, divided in any way, though if slight had been clearly bright, different."

Brigham City, Utah

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

After some deliberation I feel I must write to you concerning an object that my fifteen year old daughter and I saw last May 16th.

This object was located west of Brigham City, Utah, and was viewed by us for about eight minutes from 5:15 PM to 5:23 PM. The last minute I viewed it through field glasses whereby I was able to see the object in more detail.

Intending to get a closer view, I drove my car to the edge of town. This short drive took from two to two and one-half minutes to complete. The object, however, was nowhere in sight when I parked the car.

The day was especially clear and bright, and we saw the object very distinctly. It was approximately 22 miles in the distance across the Great Salt Lake basin resting near a barren area named Promontory. At first we thought it was a large tank, similar to the butane storage. It first found in my binoculars was a large, long object which had the color and luster of stainless steel. It had supports which were of the same height as the body of the object. These supports were tapered and had traces within them.

Soon after the object disappeared many planes including cargo, jets and airliners were observed in the area just mentioned. They were apparently from nearby Hill Field in Ogden, Utah. I have since been contacted in location close Glen who might have seen the object and were presumed that someone had seen the object and notified Hill Field.

Sincerely,

[Signature and name redacted]

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Thank you for your letter of July 10, inquiring about the whereabouts of our two Goodyear airships on June 13, 1968. Neither of our airships was in the area of Dayton, Ohio, on that date.

One was in San Antonio, Texas, while the other was in Rochester, N.Y.

One of the blimps was in Dayton from approximately May 7 through May 15, but neither has been in that area since then.

It would appear, then, that we cannot be of assistance in helping you to clean up the matter of the sighting in question.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Sky Aglow

Not From Mars!

Strange lights flashed over Dayton last night and witnesses thought turned to unidentified flying objects.

Puzzled viewers called Wright-Patterson Air Force base and The Journal Herald to report the lights. Partly cloudy skies didn't come from visitors from Mars, but rather from a Goodyear promotional blimp putting on a "sky-glow" light.

The base was quick to say there had been a call every ten minutes for a half hour.

The 190-foot airship has more than 3,000 light bulbs blinking and flashing from an underside view.

Investigation of June 8, 1968

This report concerns a sighting reported by Mr. [redacted] (Ranger Rd., Mosinee, Wisconsin); the event took place on Wednesday night, May 29, 1968, at 10:00 P.M.

At the interview, the witnesses present were Mr. [redacted] and his wife, his son [redacted] and a daughter [redacted] and his daughter. The principal witnesses were Mr. [redacted] and his daughter. The others (except for [redacted]) having been present, but being too frightened to make any useful observations.

The sighting began as the family had just gone to bed; the girls were in two beds (the younger pair sharing one bed, and [redacted] having the bed next to the window). [redacted] heard a sound getting louder and louder, and noticed that there was a light outside. At this point the shade covering the window was all the way down. [redacted] pulled the shade aside and looked out the window, where she saw a very bright light just west of north, over the ground in the back yard. It was so bright, she said, that looking directly at it was painful. As she watched, too frightened to say anything, she could see the light coming closer. In order to see the light past a tree growing right outside the window, she had to look to the left; this leads to a line of sight passing just by the tree-trunk and over the fencepost marking the northwest corner of the back yard. An object in that direction would have been nearly in line with a gap between trees growing behind the neighbor's yard.


- page 104 -

June 6, 1968

then saw the object appear to tilt upward slightly, and then could see the whole outline of it, and a protruding "wing" (The family had drawn pictures of the object for an officer from the sheriff's police; these drawings will be obtained).

At the same time that Linda was watching out her bedroom window, Mr. had heard the sound and was sitting on the edge of his bed looking out the window toward the back yard; he also saw a light, but no outline. The light was hovering about "15 foot above that corner fence-post", again in line with the gap between trees (the two windows are only about 15 feet apart).

Just prior to the sighting, Mr. had been preparing for bed, and noticed that the dresser lamp became very dim for a moment; he thought there might be a power failure, and so got undressed quickly and into bed while the light was still available. At the time he said he may have noticed a noise, but that occasionally they picked up a little noise from the belt-line (the main highway) and paid no attention to it.

The noise then got louder and louder, and "It got lighter out there. I looked out the window, and there it was."

He continues, "I would say from here I could just see the light... it was like a big floodlight right aimin' at me." The sound was like a turbine starting up - a sound that rises and falls in pitch and loudness, getting higher and higher pitched. The description matches very closely the sound of an electronic police-car siren (see later).

heard scream then, and thinking that she was in

June 9, 1968

some danger, ran out of his bedroom; he nearly collided with her, since she was also leaving her bedroom. Together they ran to the garage at the west side of the house and out the back door onto a concrete patio.

When [redacted] got outside, he could see the object now at about a 50 degree elevation (indicating an angle quite close to 60 degrees); it was tilted up so that the bright light was partly hidden, and he could see the circular outline of the body of the object, dark against the back-ground of light. From the bottom there was what looked like a trailing wing protruding.

The sound reached its maximum just after everyone went outside, becoming a steady high-pitched scream that was so loud that Duberstein said he had to put his fingers in his ears. The object climbed on a course from north to south that brought it closer and then directly overhead.

As it passed overhead, he then ran back into the garage and out the front (south) door; the object was then just a little south of overhead. At this time the object appeared as a circular patch of light, much higher.

It appeared to pause for a moment, and then, "in less than a second", moved rapidly south, disappearing as if the light had been turned off when the object was visible in a gap through treetops across the street to the south, at an elevation of about 15 degrees.

Reconstructing the time-sequence on the basis of the taped interview, it would appear that the initial observations from the bedrooms took between 5-20 seconds; getting outside required about 10 seconds; the observation in the back yard lasted another 15 seconds, and getting


- page 106 -

June 8, 1968

to the front yard took another 10 seconds; the final phase probably
lasted about 10 seconds. The total time of the event, then, would be
about one minute; the estimate given by was 2 to 2½ minutes. A
reasonable estimate would be one to two minutes.

While the events at the home were occurring, the son
and his friend, were walking along some railroad tracks about
one-half mile north of the home, their position being in a
direct line with the window-to-fencepost line of sight described previously.
They heard a wavering sound "like a police car", and saw the sky to the
northeast light up. The light appeared to travel rapidly (in less than
five seconds) from bearing 045 to bearing 120. No light-source was
seen, just the lit-up sky. The point where the light disappeared was
in the direction of the Duberstein home, but could also have been over
the highway. Neither boy thought much of what they had seen. They
returned home within ten or fifteen minutes, and only related what they
had seen when Mr. said that they had missed seeing a flying
saucer.

said that he never had believed in those things before;
in fact when he heard that his children were learning about UFOs in
school, he thought the teacher was wasting their time on nonsense. The
only book on UFOs he has in the house is a paperback by Frank Edwards,
given to him after his sighting, by a friend. He now definitely believes
that there are such things.

At the time of the sighting the weather was threatening. The
ceiling was about 650 feet, solidly overcast, and there was a tornado


- page 107 -

June 8, 1964

warning out for an area about 15 miles to the west; a funnel cloud had
been reported.

Immediately after the sighting went to several neighbors'
houses to find out if they had seen or heard anything. One neighbor said
she had heard something, but thought it was a flock of geese; her mother
heard something, too, but thought the children had the television on. At
another house the neighbor said she heard nothing, but the television set
was on and the children were making noise.

called the county sheriff's office, and within 15
minutes Officer Lester Rawlings, Jr. was dispatched to the home.
Rawlings said he talked with the family for about an hour, trying to
convince them that they hadn't seen anything, and came away convinced
that they certainly had observed something. He ascertained, however,
that at the exact time of the sighting, state patrol car 403 had been on
the highway one-half mile north of the home, with its "yelp"
siren going. These electronic sirens make a sound that is very high-
pitched, loud, and that wavers rapidly in pitch and loudness. He
feels that this siren accounts adequately for the sound that the family
heard, but not for what they saw.

Investigators knew of this possibility when they went to see
the and had arranged for the county police to have a car
go to an appropriate spot at 2:15 P.M. (the interview was set for 2:00 P.M.)
and turn on the siren. At about 2:20 P.M. the investigators and the male
witnesses went to the railroad tracks where the boys had been, while the
daughter northerly remained at the house. No sound was heard at the


- page 108 -

June 8, 1968                                                 -6-

railroad tracks, and the other witnesses said nothing about having heard
anythings.

The location where the police car had been with its siren on, the
night of the sighting, was described as "one-half mile north" of the
[redacted] residence. However, the residence is about one-half mile
west of the highway, so that the total distance is closer to three-
quarters of a mile. Also the highway goes through a deep cut and is
generally 50 feet or more below the level of the hill on which the
[redacted] live. It is possible that sound propagation depends heavily
on weather conditions. It is hard to reconcile the outcome of the
experiment, however, with the description of the sound as being so loud
that the witness had to cover his ears.

The boys described the light they saw as being bluish; this
could easily be tied to the blue rotating light on the state patrol
car. The description [redacted] gave, however, of a brilliant spotlight
having the color and brightness of a welder's arc is not consistent with
the idea that reflected light caused his visual impression, or that
of his daughter. The line of sight given by the witnesses at the house
bears 245, or fifteen degrees west of the direction of the road; the line
of sight could not possibly have passed closer to the road than one-half
mile, the location of the house from the highway.

Pending further investigation, it appears now that what the boys
saw and heard could be ascribed to the police car; the sound to its
siren, and the moving bluish light to the light from the rotating blue

light on the car lighting up the low-hanging clouds. The bright spotlight, however, and the general behavior of the object, cannot be easily associated with the police car. There appears to be a coincidence; it is even conceivable that the sound from the siren did reach the house, due to the peculiar weather conditions at the time, but that there was also a sound from the object. It would seem important to talk to the driver of the police car, to see why he had his siren on.

[Redacted name] mentioned that after the object reached altitude and went to the south, that "I never knew the neighbors had so many dogs around here. They were all just - bayin', you know, just whining, and my dog out in the back here, she was on top of the doghouse trying to jump over the fence." Apparently the noise must have really hurt their ears. "Everyone agreed that the noise was extremely loud, a fact that makes it difficult to believe that the siren, at the very closest one-half mile away, could have created so much noise."

Mr. Rawlings said he reported the event to the Antigo Radar Base, but that the radar operator told him he could get no returns from the radar direction because of weather conditions; the returns were dropped from rain cloud reflections.

Rawlings also checked with the local airport, but there was no traffic that night, except for one arrival from Stevens Point at 9:36 P.M. He did not check, however, for arrivals at Stevens Point, which is 19 miles south, which has a field where jets land.

There is a possibility that the family saw a jet airplane with


- page 110 -

June 8, 1969

with its landing light on. Checking with North Central Airlines at Stevens Point, however, revealed that the last inbound flight was on the ground at 9:00 P.M. (Daylight Saving Time), and that an outbound flight (not a jet) to Wausau departed at 10:14 P.M. Neither flight can be associated with the sighting.

The only remaining possibility is a military jet from Antigo Air Base.

The driver of the state patrol car in question was Sgt. Thomas Price; his home phone is 359-4795, and the office number is 845-1144.

Television station WSAU requested viewers to report anything unusual they saw; three reports from the night in question were received.

The respondents were [redacted] (Rothschild/Schofield) area, Wausau, [redacted], Whiting

Another report for May 2 was received from [redacted] (seen at Goodnow), phone [redacted]

The employee at North Central Airlines said that "one time" an incoming jet refused to land until a strange object that was flying near the airport departed.

"Sounds are usually heard at greater distances during the night than during the day. On calm nights the range of audibility of a sound may be as much as 10 or 20 times as great as it is during the day. This effect is due partly to the increased sensitiveness of the ear at night owing to the decrease in the amount of accidental disturbing sounds, partly to the inversion of temperature which commonly occurs on calm, clear nights, and has the effect of bending the sound waves downwards, but chiefly to the diminution of the amount of disturbance in the atmosphere at night."

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAY 20-26, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Maps. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temper- ature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500- Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Maps. An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained by writing to Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents the data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. local standard time.

The charts in this publication are indicated by shading. The weather records that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled at low values. The temperature isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. local standard time. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is noted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. The chart also shows the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

All of the charts for any day are arranged on a single page of this report. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used by the U.S. Weather Bureau Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. The 500 Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature patterns of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./est. The height contours are drawn as continuous lines, and temperature stationers are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under investigation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAY 13-19, 1968

The charts in this publication are a.m./e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operation of these weather maps. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature patterns at the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature patterns are shown as isotherms, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The charts are a consolidation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are traced from the operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and may be obtained by writing to Environmental Services Administration, Publications Section, Ad-143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The Surface Weather Map presents the analyses for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The temperatures are obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is noted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is noted below the station point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts are in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are to the nearest period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the position of 0 or 0.1 on the ground in inches at of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
