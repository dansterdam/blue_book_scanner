1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 31 May 63 01/02002
2. LOCATION: Wyoming, Ohio
10. CONCLUSION: Probable (BALLOON)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer reported to the Duty Officer that he had sighted a BRIGHT RED FLASHING LIGHT, directly overhead. At times the light appeared to dim and then brighten at a rate of approximately 2 flash/sec. The duration of observation was approximately 1 hour, 30 minutes. Since the description sounds closely similar to balloon-borne lights, BILL FARR returned 16 Sept 63. The wind at that time was almost still. COMMENTS: Except for the duration, the description sounds closely similar to a balloon-borne light. From 13 returned to 16 Sept 63. The wind at almost still.

DETAILED ACCOUNT OF UFO SIGHTING: - At approximately 2100 hours on 5/5/68, Mr. James Snider, a 36-year-old resident of Wyoming, Ohio, reported observing a strange aerial object which he could not identify. 

According to Mr. Snider, the object was first sighted at about 3000 feet altitude, approximately 1/2 mile southwest of his residence. He described the object as being circular in shape, approximately 75-100 feet in diameter, and emitting a pulsing red light.

Mr. Snider stated that the object was observed for about 20 minutes, during which time it hovered silently and made several sudden, erratic movements, including a vertical ascent and descent. 

No other witnesses were reported.

INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES: - The sketches provided do not appear to be directly related to the UFO sighting, but rather seem to depict terrain features or topographical maps. No photographs of the UFO were available.

Overall, this case appears to be a report of a strange aerial phenomenon observed by a single witness. Without any corroborating evidence or additional witnesses, the precise nature of the object remains unresolved.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service
DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAY 27-JUNE 2, 1968
The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau's Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 850-Millibar Chart, and the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page for this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau, ESSA. The Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.
The Surface Weather Map presents station data and 4-panel analysis for 7:00 a.m./e.s.t. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather patterns that are depicted have a fraction of those that are included in the operational analysis, upon which the analyses are based. Occasional disparent between the printed station data and the analyses reflect conditions that cannot be included in the published space.
The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature at the 500-millibar surface, which is located approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. The height contours are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature contours, drawn in thin solid lines, are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.
The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.
The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under-lined "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashes lines show the areas of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Reference UFO Observation of 31 May 63, Ohio.

12 September 1963: Colonel Lewis called to say that he had finally completed his form and was going to send it to us or bring it down to the office. He also wanted to know what we had found out about his sighting. I said that I didn't remember it. Colonel Lewis gave some of the details over the phone. OF particular interest was the fact that he was located quite close to the Linden Co. Airport and called them at the time of the sighting. They did not paint the object; none of the Incidents aircraft reported it, and the tower personnel couldn't see the lights either. Colonel Lewis will probably call back Monday, 16 August 1963.

I feel that there is much of a interest to me in this report and yet I find it rather discouraging and disturbing. The whole thing of the phenomenon itself is to me quite puzzling in many respects. The visual aspect as well as the apparent mechanical operation, if it can be called that, is well-nigh incomprehensible from my point of view. Its apparently complete disregard of gravity if displayed is startling, and the occasional erratic and almost playful motion is something I find quite baffling and perplexing. I am certainly greatly interested and wish I could understand more about it. The whole thing is rather unsettling to me."

Transcription of the text:

1. Apparently, I saw on the object as it was coming dipping, for it appeared approximately 60' high and was bright as an automobile's headlight on high beam. It seemed to have a saucer shape and was perfectly round.

As I have a rather hazy memory of the details of the object, I submit for your careful consideration the following, which to the best of my recollection appears to be substantially correct:

The object is the color of intense Brightness of light, brighter than a spotlight with a more defined edge, but not as bright as I would expect a saucer-shaped thing(?) must have appeared to be so brightly illuminated. By (which) I was not actually scared, though if the object had come any closer, I might have been badly frightened.

U.F.O.

Since the sky was hazy, it was difficult to determine the exact object. This object was located west of Richfield City, Utah, and was viewed by us for about ten minutes. I was able to obtain a good look at it through field glasses. It was white in color and stationary during the time I viewed it.

Attached:
Project Blue Book
Patrick Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

After some deliberation, I feel I must write to you concerning an object that was sighted in this vicinity on June 6, 1968.

This object was located west of Richfield City, Utah, and was viewed by us for about ten minutes. I was able to obtain a good look at it through field glasses. It was white in color and stationary during the time I viewed it. 

Intending to get a closer view, I drove about a mile and one-half to two and one-half minutes to town. This move did not bring me any closer to the object, so I parked the car and continued to observe it. The day was especially clear and bright, and we saw the object very distinctly. It was approximately 25 miles away and appeared to be round, somewhat flattened on top, and about the size of a regular automobile tire from my vantage point. It gave off a steady glow which seemed to be illuminating parts of the ground near it. No sound was heard, and it made no apparent movement during the time we observed it.

After about the 10 minute observation period, the object suddenly disappeared from sight. We have been unable to figure out what it could have been. I have no idea as to its identity, but I am reasonably certain that it was not any known aircraft or other man-made object. There appear to be no airports or airfields in this immediate area, and no aircraft were observed in the vicinity at the time.

Sincerely,

REFERENCE YOUR TELEPHONE DATA - WYOMING, OHIO, 17 MAY 1968

An investigation was conducted of the incident described in your telephone data. The investigation revealed that the object reported was a bright object in the sky which was observed by several persons at different locations in the Wyoming, Ohio, area on the date mentioned. The object was described as being bright, round, and moving generally in a southwesterly direction. No unusual or extraordinary physical characteristics were noted. 

The witnesses were unable to determine the exact nature or identity of the object, but it was the opinion of the investigators that it was probably an astronomical phenomenon, possibly a meteor or satellite.

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Thank you for your letter of July 10, inquiring about the whereabouts of two sightings of one of our airships was in the area of Dayton, Ohio, on that date.

One was the Star Aerostar, which was in Rochester, N.Y.

The other was in Dayton from approximately May 7 through May 15, but neither has been in this area since.

It would appear, then, that we cannot be of assistance in helping you to close up the matter of this sighting.

The image contains a photographic illustration of a UFO, which is shown as a cigar-shaped object with flashing lights. The text above the image is titled "Not From Mars!" and describes the object as being sighted, with the witness stating that it was not a meteor or any known aircraft, and that the object hovered and flashed for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Not From Mars!
"All right, let's not start calling every strange light in the sky a flying saucer from Mars," some will say. This man, however, is quite convinced that the object he saw this past week-end was no meteor, no airplane, no star and not anything generally recognized as a part of our world.
Here's what he told me: "I went outside for a smoke about 10:15 p.m. and immediately noticed a bright, steady light in the northwest sky. It appeared to be some distance away and quite high up. I watched it for several minutes and it did not move or blink like a star. Then, suddenly, it began flashing on and off, first rapidly, then at about one-second intervals.
"After flashing this way for four or five minutes, the object shot straight up and disappeared in a flash. The whole performance lasted about ten minutes. I am quite familiar with planes, satellites, meteors and the like, and this was definitely not anything I've ever seen before. I know about flying saucers, of course, but I have always been a bit skeptical about them. This, however, was so strange I can't think of any earthly explanation for it."

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: (Attach additional sheets if necessary)

The object was first noticed by myself and another family member while sitting on the porch looking north. The object was sighted approximately 8:30 p.m. E.S.T.

This object appeared to be oblong in shape, extremely bright, emitting a strong light which appeared to be changing in color from red to green to yellow. The object seemed to be stationary at first and then started to move in an erratic pattern, sometimes appearing to go straight up, then sideways, then down, then up again. The object continued to move in this erratic manner for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. 

After this time period the object started to diminish in size and its intensity of light began to decrease. The object finally disappeared from our view behind some trees on the north horizon. 

This object was not an airplane, helicopter, satellite or any other known flying object. The size of the object, its intense light, and the erratic manner in which it moved, convince me and the other observer that this was not any known type of aircraft. We are completely at a loss to explain what this object could have been. I submit this report in the hope that your investigation may shed some light on this very strange occurrence.

Investigation of June 8, 1968

This report concerns a sighting reported by Mr. [redacted] (Route 1, Mosinee, Wisconsin); the event took place on Wednesday night, May 22, 1968, at 10:00 P.M.

At the inception, the witnesses present were Mr. [redacted], his wife [redacted], his son [redacted], and a friend of the son's, [redacted]. The principal witnesses (except for the others having been present, but being too frightened to make any useful observations.

The sighting began as the family had just gone to bed; the girls were in the beds (the younger pair sharing one bed, and [redacted] having the bed next to the window). They heard a sound getting louder and louder, and noticed that there was a light outside. At this point the shade covering the window was all the way down. [Redacted] pulled the shade aside and looked out the window, where she saw a very bright light just west of north. As she watched, it moved to the ground in the back yard. It was so bright, she said, that looking directly at it was painful. As she watched, too frightened to say anything, she could see the light coming closer. In order to get the light fast, she rushed to the left side of the window, but that seemed to lead to a line of sight passing just by the tree-trunk and over the fencepost marking the northwest corner of the back yard. An object in that direction would have been nearly at the level of the bedroom window.

then saw the object appear to lift upward slightly, and then could see the whole outline of it, and a pulsating "diving" type rapidly had down pictures of the object for an officer from the sheriff's police.

At the same time that Linda was watching out her bedroom window, she had heard the sound and was sitting on the edge of his bed looking out the window toward the back yard; he also saw a light, but no outline. The light was hovering about 15 foot above that corner fence post., again in line with the two windows (the two windows are only about 15 feet apart). 

Just prior to the sighting, Mr. _ had been preparing for bed, and noticed that the dresser lamp became very dim for a moment; he thought there might be a power failure, and so got undressed quickly and into bed while the light was still available. At the time he said he may have noticed a slight flicker, but nothing seemingly out of the ordinary from the belleline (the main highway) and paid no attention to it.

The notes then got louder and louder, and "it got lighter out there." I looked at the window, and there is "continued...?" I would say from here I could just see the light... 

it was "a big floodlight right starin' at me." The sound was like a turbine startup - a sound that rises and falls in pitch and loudness, getting higher and louder pitched. The description matches very closely the sound of an electronic police-car siren (see later).

some danger, ran out of his bedroom; he nearly collided with her, since she was also leaving her bedroom. Together they ran to the garage at the east side of the house and out the back door onto a concrete patio.

- at a 60 degree elevation (indicating an angle quite close to 60 degrees) it was lit up so that the bright light was partly hidden, and he could see the circular outline of the body of the object, dark against the background of light. From the bottom there was what looked like a trailing wing protruding.

The object reached its maximum just after everyone went outside, becoming an already high-pitched scream that was so loud that Duberstein said he had to put his fingers in his ears. The object climbed on a course from north to south that brought it then directly overhead.

As it passed overhead, he then ran back into the garage and out the front (south) door; the object was then just a little south of overhead. This time it appeared as a circular patch of light, much higher.

It paused for a moment, and then, "In less than a second", moved rapidly to the south, disappearing as if the light had been turned off when the object was visible in a gap as a distant flash across the street to the south.

Reckoning the time-sequence on the basis of the taped interview, it would appear that the initial observation from the bedrooms took between 20 seconds; getting outside required about 10 seconds; the observation in the back yard lasted another 15 seconds, and getting to the front door another 15 seconds.

to the front yard took another 10 seconds; the final phase probably lasted about 10 seconds. The total time of the event, then, would be about one minute; the estimate given by was 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. A reasonable estimate would be one to two minutes.
While the events at the home were occurring, the son and his friend, [REDACTED], were walking along some railroad tracks about one-half of a mile north of the home, their position being in a direct line with the window-to-fence-post line of sight described previously.
They heard a wavering sound "like a police car", and saw the sky to the northeast light up. The light appeared to travel rapidly (in less than five seconds) from bearing 045 to bearing 120. No light-source was seen, just the lit-up sky. The point where the light disappeared was in the direction of the suburban home, but could also have been over the highway. Neither boy thought much of what they had seen. They returned home within ten or fifteen minutes, and only related what they had seen when Mr. [REDACTED] said that they had missed seeing a flying saucer.
[REDACTED] said that he never had believed in those things before; in fact when he heard that his children were learning about UFOs in school, he thought the teacher was wasting their time on nonsense. The only book on UFOs he has in the house is a paperback by Frank Edwards, given to him after his sighting, by a friend. He now definitely believes that there are such things.
At the time of the sighting the weather was threatening. The ceiling was about 650 feet, solidly overcast, and there was a tornado near.

Warning out for an area about 15 miles to the west; a funnel cloud had been reported.

Immediately after the sighting, according to the account, one witness went to several neighbors' houses to find out if they had seen or heard anything. One neighbor said she had heard something, but thought it was a flock of geese; her mother heard something, too, but thought the children had the television on. Another neighbor said she heard nothing, but the television set was on and the children were making noise.

called the county sheriff's office, and within 15 minutes or so, Lester Rawlings, Jr. was dispatched to the home. Rawlings and he talked with the family for about an hour, trying to convince them that they hadn't seen anything, and came away convinced that they certainly had observed something. He ascertained, however, that the exact time of the sighting, after patrol car 402 had been on the highway one-half mile north of the home, with its "yelp" siren on. These electronic sirens make a sound that is very high-pitched, loud, and that wavers rapidly in pitch and loudness. He feels that this siren accounts adequately for the sound that the family heard.

Investigators knew of this possibility when they went to see the family, and when they had arranged for the county police to have a car go to the appropriate spot at 2:15 P.M. (the interview was set for 2:00 P.M.) and arrive at the scene. At 2:20 P.M., the investigators and the male witness went to the railroad tracks where the boys had been, while the daughter and mother remained at the house. No sound was heard at the house.

railroad tracks, and the other witnesses said nothing about having heard anything.

The location where the police car had been with its siren on, the night of the sighting, was described as "one-half mile north" of the residence. However, the residence is about one-half mile west of the highway, so that the total distance is closer to three-quarters of a mile. Also the highway goes through a deep cut and is generally 50 feet or more below the level of the hill on which the residence is located. It is possible that sound propagation depends heavily on weather conditions. It is hard to reconcile the outcome of the experiment, however, with the description of the sound as being so loud that the witnesses had to cover their ears.

The boys described the light they saw as being bluish; this could possibly be tied to the blue rotating light on the state patrol car. The description indicates, however, of a brilliant spotlight having the color and brightness of a welder's arc. This light is not consistent with the idea that it was reflected light caused by the impression, or that of his headlights. The line of sight given by the witnesses at the house barely (possibly) have passed closer to the road than one-half mile, so that the location of the house from the highway remains a further investigation.

Further investigation, it appears now that what the boys saw and heard could be ascribed to the police car; the sound to its siren, and the moving bluish light to the light from the rotating blue light of the state patrol car.

Lights on the car lighting up the low-hanging clouds. The bright spotlight, however, did not seem to be associated with the general behavior of the object. It would seem to be a coincidence; it is even conceivable that the sound from the siren did reach the house, due to the peculiar weather conditions at the time, but that there was also a sound from the object. It would seem important to talk to the driver of the police car, to see why he had his siren on.
Mentioned that after the object reached attitude and went to the south, that it never seem to bother the neighbors had so many dogs around here. They were all just - barkin', you know, just whining, and my dog out in the back here, she was on top of the doghouse crying to jump over the fence. Apparently the noise must have really hurt their ears.
Everyone agreed that the noise was extremely loud, a fact that makes it difficult to believe that the siren, at the very closest one-half mile, could have created so much noise.
Mr. Rawlings said he reported the event to the Antiogo Radar Base, but that the radar operator told him he could get no returns from that direction because of weather conditions; the returns were from rain cloud reflections.
They also checked with the local airport, but there was no traffic and for one arrival from Stevens Point, which is 19 miles southwest, which has a field where jets land.
There is a possibility that the family saw a jet airplane with lights on, but the lighting and general behavior of the object seems to be inconsistent with a jet airplane.

Dear sir,

Enclosed is a carbon copy of the report to the sheriff's department of Marathon County, on the sighting of the UFA near Mosine, WI 29.

One correction I might make... on page 2, there is reference to a Frank Koszak-- this should be Frank Jerzak of the UFA.

It is not necessary to return this report... I look forward to seeking you on Friday, and hope we have some response to request or further witnesses...

Sincerely,

REPORT ON Unidentified flying object reported by John Stevenson, Route Road, Harding,
TO Donald A. Westmoreland
AS of 10:15 P.M. on 5/29/68, an object was observed to me a Mr. XXXXX, who resided on Range Road, Harding, Wisconsin. This is across the Harding Ranger Station, in reference to his report on a UFO.
No witnesses were interviewed. The following report is as to the extent data has X xxxxx, who was just going about his regular duties when he heard this sound (like the flying saucers on TV) he came out of his kitchen and was staring through the kitchen when his daughter walked out about 25 yards out of the building.
He stated to her the following: "Do you see that thing out there in the sky?" She stated "Yes, I see it." Accordingly, he and his daughter watched this object for about 15 minutes as it appeared to be just hovering and maneuvering in the sky. He stated that this strange object was in a downward-slght position to him. As he stared drawing) it appeared very bright(like the light of and slowly reduced in size and finally disappeared in a southwesterly direction. According to his time length and observation, this object was in existence for about 20 minutes. He has no idea as to the size of the object, but it appeared to be very large and round in shape. The color he stated was a bright white light, much brighter than any of the planets or stars he has observed. He stated it did not waver or move back and forth, but just appeared to hover in one spot and then slowly disappeared in a southwesterly direction.
Walter Martiner had just left the Phillips Truck and moved was walking away when this was reported to him. Walter Martiner stated he did not observe the object as he left and was working on a truck at the time.
Based on this report, it is the opinion of the underwritten that this matter is unsolved and a further check should be made with other persons who may have observed the same object.
Deputy Recorder, Harding County Sheriff's Dept.
at 12:01 AM 5-30-68.

"Sounds are usually heard at greater distances during the night than during the day. On calm nights the range of audibility of a sound may be as much as 10 or 20 times as great as it is during the day. This effect is due partly to the increased sensitiveness of the ear at night owing to the decrease in the amount of accidental disturbing sounds, partly to the inversion of temperature which commonly occurs on calm, clear nights, and has the effect of bending the sound waves downwards, but chiefly to the diminution of the amount of disturbance in the atmosphere at night."

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAY 13-19, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the National Weather Service publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the analysis weather charts, the GO-millibar chart, the height and lowest Temperature chart, and the Mean Lower Air Temperature chart. All of the charts for any day are presented on a single page of this publication. They are coded from operationally required analytical weather analyses prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau, ESSA, for the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart which are the same as those shown in Daily Weather Map.

The Surface Weather Map presents analyzed synoptic weather conditions at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The 500-Millibar Chart presents the analyses of the 500-millibar surface, which is about 18,000 feet above sea level, at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t.

The analysis areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are plotted here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and upon which the analyses are based. Occasional disagreement between the printed station data and the analyses result from the changes which are introduced into the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and temperature patterns of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown in solid lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The temperature patterns, shown by dashed lines, are labeled in degrees Celsius.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points are obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of symbols the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:30 a.m. of the previous day. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are shown within these precipitation areas.
