THE CASE FILE
Ground-Visual: The ground visual sightings appear to be of the same objects reported in the air visual sightings. The high-speed maneuvers and the temporary loss of UFO transmission could be attributed to guided missile test and the maneuvering characteristics of the object(s) observed. The location at the time, or it could be a light on the ground, or possibly a plasma.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
Subject: UFO Observation, Minot AFB, North Dakota, 7 October 1968
At about 1730 hours the FTD Duty Officer called Lt Marron and said that they had a pretty important UFO sighting from Minot AFB. I (Lt Marron) asked him what it was about and he said the only information he had was that the crew of a B-52 had sighted and photographed an UFO and that the Base Commander and Major General Nichols of the 15th Air Force were both interested. I got back to the details as soon as they would allow. They had called Col Hollich, the UFO investigator, 697-1959 ext 3030 or 3231.

I asked him if he wanted immediate reaction from our office and he said no, that he didn't necessarily want us to call him back that night and that our Duty Officer was really more excited than he was. However, since it was such an unusual sighting he wanted to know if we could help him in any way.

I asked him the details of the sighting and he gave them.

At about 0330 hours local, a B-52 that was about 30 miles northwest of Minot AFB and was making practice penetrations sighted an unidentified blip on their radar. Initially the target traveled approximately 15 mile in 3 sec or at about 3,000 mi/hr. After passing from the right to the left of the plane it assumed a position off the left wing of the B-52. The blip stayed off the left wing for approximately 20 miles at which point it broke off. Some photographs were taken. When the target was close to the B-52 neither of the two transmitters in the B-52 would operate properly but when it broke off both returned to normal function.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing an incident involving a bright, orange-hued object hovering at about 3,000 ft or so, with a sound similar to a jet engine. The text describes the object accelerating and appearing to stop at about 6-8 miles away, and the observer losing sight of it shortly afterward.

The text also mentions that 14 other people in separate locations reported sighting a similar object, and that an alarm was activated. It discusses the physical characteristics of the object and the weather conditions at the time. The text also notes that the control tower personnel did not see anything, and the report discusses the difficulties in determining whether the object was a physical object or something else.

At about this time a missile maintenance man called in and reported sighting a bright orangish-red object. The object was hovering at about 3000 ft or so, and had a sound similar to a jet engine.  The observer had stopped his car, but he then started it up again. As he started to move the object followed him then accelerated and appeared to stop at about 6-8 miles away. The observer shortly afterward lost sight of it.

In response to the maintenance man's call the B-52, which had continued its penetration run, was vectored toward the visual which was about 10 miles northwest of the base. The B-52 confirmed having sighted a bright light of some type that appeared to be hovering just over or on the ground.

Fourteen other people in separate locations also reported sighting a similar object. Also, at this approximate time, security alarm for one of the sites was activated. This was an alarm for both the outer and inner ring. When guards arrived at the scene they found that the outer door was open and the combination lock on the inner door had been moved. The weather was generally misty, the temperature was 39-43 deg F and the wind 5-10 knots.

He did not have all the information such as: whether it had been painted by the radars at the control tower? If control tower personnel had sighted anything unusual? If he had compared the sighting with the design and elevation from the newspaper clippings, to determine if they were looking at the same object or if they could have been possibly looking at stellar bodies? He also, got Merrick did not have an exact time sequence for the events.

Col Merrick agreed and said that he would gather the information.

RECORD FOR THIS RECORD
SUBJECT: 26 OCT 69 UFO SIGHTING FROM MINOT AFB, N.D.

At 11:35, 26 OCT 69, Sgt Jones received a call from Col. Wayant, HQ SAC, Offutt AFB, Nebr.
He wanted to know how we received the UFO report from Minot AFB. Sgt Jones informed him it was received by phone.
Col Wayant then asked what interest we took in a report like this and what we do when we receive the report. Sgt Jones told him it should have been given to the UFO Investigator but since it was passed into V-INT-DITURBO. Lt Pearson would get in-touch with the UFO Investigator at Minot. Col Wayant then said "the Investigator would handle it in accordance with AFR 80-17". Sgt Jones told him that we can't do anything until you receive their report". Sgt Jones said, that's right.
Col Wayant also wanted to know if there was any other reports for that period or time from that area. Sgt Jones told him to the best of his knowledge, he didn't think there was. Col Wayant said, who ever is handling the report to give him a call at 5556/1235, Sgt Jones informed that would be Lt Moreno.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: Call fm Col Wyatt, SAC Hq
At 2350 hours, 23 Oct 69, Col Wyatt, called Lt Marano and wanted to know if we (Lt Marano) had received any indication of any other reports from Minot.
Lt Marano informed him that we haven't received any other reports from that area.
We do get a copy of reports in accordance with AFR 80-17. Lt Marano told Col Wyatt that Col Werlick at Minot was doing the investigation. Col Werlick had called the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson who in turn called Lt Marano and he (Lt M) called Col Quintanilla and they both called Col Werlick. Col Wyatt said he was trying to determine whether ADC had any known phenomena on radar. Col Wyatt asked Lt Marano if we ever participated in any investigations. Very seldom do we ever go out in the field. As far as Lt Marano was concerned Col Werlick was quite competent and he didn't feel that Col Werlick needed any additional help at this time. Col Wyatt said he gave Col Werlick the guidance and he presumed that Col Werlick got the telephone number out of the regulation.
Col Wyatt said he felt that we couldn't give him any more information so he ended the conversation.

STATEMENT OF TECHNICAL SERGEANT WILLIAM L. TILDEN, USAF
MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA

On 7 October 1968, I was on duty as NCO in charge of the 5th Munitions Maintenance Squadron at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. At approximately 2300 hours, I observed a bright, bluish-white light in the southwestern sky over the Sundre Range. The light was definitely not an aircraft or satellite. It remained stationary for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes, then suddenly moved rapidly in a horizontal direction to the east, stopped abruptly, and then moved rapidly back to its original position. The light then hovered for a short time and finally disappeared.

I immediately notified the Command Post and the Security Police of my observation. I was instructed to continue observing the light and to report any further developments. The light was observed by several other persons on the base, including the Security Police. The Weather Flight was notified and they reported no unusual weather conditions or phenomena that could account for the light.

I am a trained and experienced observer, having served in the Air Force for over 15 years. I have observed many aircraft, satellites, and other normal aerial phenomena, and I can state with certainty that the light I observed on 7 October 1968 was not any known or conventional aerial object. It displayed movement and behavior patterns that are consistent with reports of unidentified flying objects.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: Telephone conversation with Col Pullen, Hq SAC
On 22 October 1959 at 1230 hours, Col Quintanilla telephone Col Pullen, Hq SAC, autovan 631-4300 (regular ext 2823, however he was at 4336). Col Pullen wanted a brief run down on the Minot sightings. Col Quintanilla told Col Pullen that he thought the airborne radar receiver might also have caused the blip since it occurred for only a short period of time. The weather could have been a factor since there was an inversion. Also, the complete flight path is listed as having occurred for almost 30 minutes and fifteen minutes. I feel that some of the men were looking at celestial bodies because of the inversion, causing scintillation. There were a number of stars in the area at the time. Col Pullen said he would, however we have to get the times. This business of two hours is too long to make an accurate report. There was an inversion between 7 and 9 and later. I'm (Col Quintanilla) guessing under it was some ground interference that also caused the blip or because of the inversion he might have also picked up an anomalous blip. Unfortunately, Col Berlich wasn't able to have this pull a quick inspection of the set. Col Pullen wanted to know if we sent anybody up there to investigate the sighting. We did not, we sent myself, an assistant, a secretary and an admin sergeant. I talked to Col Berlich for over thirty minutes and since this didn't appear to unusual, I didn't send anyone up. As I said, Col Quintanilla send a preliminary report didn't get the thig over to General Stewart to get this thing slammed down. Send it 330 SAC, attention Col Pullen. He requested that Col Quintanilla hit a little heavy on go that he could give it to someone like this would help to comply with the issue down.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

9 November 1954

Subj: Telephone conversation of 31 Oct 54, Col Werlich - Lt Marsan

Col Werlich had the people fill out the AF Forms 117, of course. He said I mentioned them while they filled them out, but I can't see where a navigator can help. What I did was take a blotter to get the angles and show them what GO,30 etc angles were.

The descriptions of this will take care of these sightings also. The courses were quite varied over a couple of hours and the objects took many courses. It will be interesting to cross check it with the RAPCON versus the ground observers. Most of the original sightings were of the aircraft.

The one we (Lt Marsan) are mainly interested in the one that cannot be identified. The one of radar and the aircraft correlated pretty well. But the other said Lt Marsan should get a session map of the area. Base ops at Wright-Patterson has hundreds of the statistical maps of the Minot area.

Look on map, half way down the runway, TACAN, 30° radius, 16 nautical miles. This is where aircraft saw the object. There's farm fields there. There is nothing there that would produce this, type of lights. The came for October 7 which is near Greno. I have gone over that are with a chopper. This weekend I would like to go down with a camera sooner and to about up the OSCAR 7 break-in. I (Col Werlich)

think you will find that the most information comes from Airman
O'Conner and Islay, and an aircraft inspector. Much of their
attention and description are corroborated by the activity of the B-52.
It was only at the end that I was unable to pin point the fact
that they did observe a light source and the B-52. You can
see the lights of the base for at least 50 miles away. I (Col W)
asked if they saw the B-52 come towards the object. We know
the B-52 got real close to it. Did they see this object on the
ground? (Lt Mr asked). They were able to use a flashlight source
while the B-52 got in real close until it disappeared.
It Serrano asked if it was going with the wind and explained
how we have had trouble with not air balloons and he gave the
description, duration, etc.
Col Werton informed Lt Serrano that if he was familiar with
the geography he would see why this wouldn't be possible.
There was he four or five farm houses within a ten miles radius
and Grain with silo to ten small dwellings and the area is
deserted at this time of the morning. I doubt that there would
be any activity like this. The sighting was about eleven miles
from November 7 radio. This is a sensitive subject. Anybody
that could unlock the padlock wouldn't be a prankster from the
farm areas. There are keys for these padlocks and it's hard to

Judged how many keys have been made. It looks like a Navy hatch and understand it is the consolidation look. Interesting just couldn't go and open it. The person, if it was a person, would have to know how to open it. We have had about three occurrences of this in the last two or three years where doing this. All these cases were traced back to AP's. Guys who had been in the service on these areas. It is not a serious offense. 99 chances cut of 100, that if a person, a human being, accomplished this thing, then it is just that he is somebody who had a key to the padlock. 

Lt Marano told Col Verlich that we have no evidence though that the UFO events did this. Col Verlich agreed but said that a subsequent condition the area the next day and could find no evidence of cars, tire tracks, footprints, etc. Col Verlich said he didn't know if an examination investigation was going on or not. But felt they probably were looking into it. Lt Marano asked him to get the results of their investigation. Col Verlich said he was trying to take a positive approach towards this investigation. Almost 50 per cent were looking at the.

B 50. If you would take a look at an aircraft at 20,000 ft, then you wouldn't see much but I'm am to place logic in that if was there and what they saw was there. There is enough there that it is worth looking at. Nobody can definitely say that these people definitely saw the aircraft, but within reason they probably did. Lt Marano told Col Verlich that HAS was giving us trouble because they wanted to know what we are.

doing. Thursday afternoon I (Col. Warren) called, with the personal opinion that we needed technical assistance at that time and that is what we requested and we didn't get it and we have tried to do what we could. Gen Hollingsworth is interested.

Anyway, I'm sending the RAPCON TAPES, PHOTOS, and an overlay showing a movement of the aircraft, description of the aircraft movement prior to VFR aircraft was going through maneuvers and it would be most impossible to track it perfectly since he was doing steep turns, "S" turns, and how time and duration of the sighting was in my message. figure out the B-52 was in the TOX. I only stated one radar in the message because there was only one radar set. The ADC equipment wasn't been used. RAPCON was getting, I.F.F. equipment was operating in the airplane. It's a fairly good size blip. Every time it sweeps it shows the blip. The object would have been covered by the blip. They do a large slow to the south, Anyway, they do not remember having any contact, identified object on the plane. The unusual part is the B-52 was in the middle of a sentence and the young just split transmitting right in the middle of the word. Because we had an accident a couple of weeks ago we were quite interested. Ground control asked them if they had any trouble to give radar equate, the altitude changes, both our aircraft to operate was requested, and each time to show that they could receive they hit the "dash" gives when could use it for it to transmit.

The text in the document is as follows:

There was quite a bit of this. The navigator was the point of attention as I expressed. My personal opinion is that it couldn't be a malfunction because they transmitted before and afterwards. The aircraft was not obscured or lost as a transmission was working. I don't know if the heavy haze would have been enough to blank out the transmission. Lt. Harris explained that we do not have a good time change. Col. Sarlie, whom he talked to after with the first things first in his IMG. The most important things are the AF Form 117 and the transcription with SAFFAO. It seems then explained about the many astronomical bodies that were over the area at the time and when there is quite an inversion they are magnified even greater. But warish raids some of the observers could see stars and others couldn't. He had a Ranger Ann type of cover. So many layers of haze, quite a layer of haze. Col Sarlie than put 85% disease from the watchtower officer in the balloon went by. 5965 Dickson was sending us the weather data, however, he said we should be able to obtain the weather from the base weather office at Wright Patterson data got it as it comes off the wires. The weather data set Dickson used was obtained from Glasgow.

The following data was given:
5000 ft alt temp 5.0 Dew point -35.0
5000    +10.5 -20

Text extracted from the document:

There was a pretty good temperature inversion.

Col Warlich said he would send an overlay for the 500 series map chart which is used by the home people in the operating section and the people over at USAF should have the master chart.

The chart is classified so to save time, signatures, etc, Col Warlich is just sending the overlay so that we can put it over the chart that the home people have. See the B-52 Nav targeting people for the 500 series chart.

Gen Hollingsworth has been given all the information that Col Warlich obtained. Col Warlich said that Gen Hollingsworth was briefing Gen Compton and this briefing was probably going on at the same time Col Warlich was speaking with Lt Marano (this was approx 2:30, 29 Oct). Col Warlich said that you had to realize that there is only one person looking at the radar with the charts, the others didn't take missile photos at first until the pilot said why don't you take some photos. This was towards the end. They had to visually all the way down. Each object in the photos is nothing of value in this conversation. The clip changes shape, round, rectangular, etc. 

Col Warlich said he would be flying tomorrow and Monday. Col Warlich said he had done the initial investigation in accordance with the regulation and I'm at the limit of my capabilities.

Col Warlich I can send supplemental data and will if we make a request. Col Warlich said we were hoping for technical assistance.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
3 November 1968
Talked to Mr. Goff, TDPA, who is quite familiar with air-borne radars. Mr. Goff said that from the evidence available at this time it would appear to him that the sightings have been precipitated by some type of ionized air plasma similar to ball lightning. He felt that a plasma could account for the radar blips, loss of transmission and some of the visual sightings. The entry of the missile site is being investigated by local authorities and with the information at our disposal at this time no explanation is referred.

AIC Adams  
AIC Janiewski

0342   Silas Balko  
AIC Jenkins  
AIC Richardson

At 0309 hours the initial report was received from a maintenance team director whom suspected a fire at the ammo storage area. An AIC Officer came this base tic to investigate. They further stated that it was reddish orange in color, a very strange light, oblong shape slowly rotating and white lightning within the object but no engine noise. At 0315 the object moved South at a high rate of speed and left the area. Ext Pond the FCO at Nov Pike stated that the object which looked to his set this time was the same one that has moved about one mile away with the two CAB following. They came within 1/2 mile of the object but could not determine what it was. Ext Smith of Canon-1 saw the object accelerate in two directions and pass under some clouds. The entire observation period was 15 minutes. The entire conservation period as near as can be determined was about 15 minutes.

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The text in the document is as follows:

We most saw it 10:23 t0 10:45 ??? one east of us while on routine training. It started moving straight south. We arrived at the site a few minutes later and observed the object from our car. It was unusual in appearance and completely unlike any aircraft we have ever seen or heard of. It came within about one fourth of a mile of us. The sound was that of jet engine. It was in this same area for about 30 minutes. We took no pictures as we had no camera. The object was metallic in color, quite large, and made no sound that we could hear.

A search of the area failed to reveal the object and no explanation could be found for the sighting.

18. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT?
19. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM YOU?
20. DID THE OBJECT MAKE ANY NOISE? IF SO, DESCRIBE IT. 
21. DESCRIBE THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENON, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS, AND NUMBER OF COMPONENT PARTS.
THE OBJECT OF SIGHTING THAT IMPRESSED ITSELF ON MY MIND WAS THE FACT THAT IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OR FLOATING IN THE SKY AND IT SEEMED TO BE METALLIC IN NATURE. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TELL THE EXACT SHAPE AS IT MOVED ERRATICALLY AND IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF IT HAD A DEFINITE OUTLINE OR IF IT APPEARED TO CHANGE SHAPES. IT WAS CERTAINLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY AIRCRAFT THAT I HAVE SEEN BEFORE.
22. IF YOU WITNESSED ANY UNUSUAL EFFECT ON YOURSELF OR OTHERS, OR ON ANY ANIMALS, PLANTS, OR OBJECTS IN THE VICINITY, PLEASE DESCRIBE.
23. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY EFFECT ON LANDSCAPE, STRUCTURES, OR EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA?
24. HAVE YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS THAT MAY BE USEFUL IN INTERPRETING THIS REPORT?
I'm afraid that I can't identify the details of the object, but I can say that it was not a conventional aircraft and seemed to be hovering or floating in the sky. It appeared to be metallic in nature, but the exact shape was difficult to discern as it moved erratically. It was certainly not like any aircraft I had seen before.
25. HAVE YOU WITNESSED ANY SIMILAR PHENOMENA BEFORE OR SINCE? IF SO, PLEASE GIVE DETAILS.
26. DO YOU HAVE ANY THEORIES ABOUT THE NATURE OF WHAT YOU OBSERVED? IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL IN INTERPRETING THIS REPORT?

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting reported by Airman Isley.

The text from the document is as follows:

Airman Isley stated that he observed the object from 0230 to 0430, for 2 hours. It was seen south of his position, first being seen in the west and disappearing in the southeast. The lights looked like the lights of a jet aircraft and it came within 4 miles of his location twice. The sound was that of jet engines. During the period of observation it went out of sight 3 to 4 times and then reappeared. At one time he sighted two objects. Also sighted B-52 on its first pass.

AIC O'Connors, who was with Airman Isley, stated that he saw the UFO from 0230 to 0335 hours. (He explanation for conflict in duration.) The light was seen moving in various directions in the southern skies. The object appeared to be a self-luminous reddish-white ball of white light that seemed to change to a green light, then later to a dull amber color. A noise similar to that of a jet aircraft. A light on the object was caused to blink out as the sighting and the object did not appear again after the B-52 made its first pass (22 miles pass at about 0335 hours).

AIC Jabunoaki, who was dispatched by 896th Bomb to November 1 with Airman Isley and AIC O'Connors, reported that he sighted the object for two hours off and on. The object was self luminous with glowing orange-red, white, and greenish alternating and at times.

- page 101 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting that occurred.

Combinations could be seen. When first dispatched, sighted another object exactly the same as that which appeared out of the east and moved toward the other. A B-52 was diverted to the general area.

First seen and heard about 35 minutes after first sighting of object. Object stayed basically to the southeast, while B-52 was in southwestern position.

Alc Adams, who was dispatched with AIC Jablonski, also stated that he sighted the object for about two hours in the southern skies. The UFO seemed to assume a stationary position. First it was a hovering position, then it would speed up. The reddish orange light kept changing white and occasionally green. B-52 bomber heard approaching 15 minutes after seeing UFO. B-52 was said to be much higher than UFO.

Sgt. Hand sighted the object in the southern skies for two hours twenty-six minutes. The UFO appeared as a point of light. It appeared about the same as landing lights on the B-52 which was diverted to the area, except for the flashing red lights on the B-52.

Sgt. Smith sighted the UFO from 0355 to 0410 hours. It was primarily in the south-southwest OBC and on for 1 hour 15 minutes.

The object appeared as though a star would appear on the horizon on a clear night. The phenomenon appeared to be a reddish burst change. Sgt. Smith saw it come and shine as a star might twinkle.

OCR output:

He also noticed a slight hint of green. The object resembled the planet Mars, in color and size, as it rose on the horizon. Major Perrin, the pilot of the F-94, visually sighted an unidentified light from 0430 till 0435 hours local. It appeared as a bright orange ball of light about 15 miles away in the west-northwest, and was neither on the ground or slightly above the ground. The light remained stationary as he flew toward it. He turned onto a base leg about one mile south of the light and was above it. The light did not move during this time.
He detailed information was submitted to this office relative to the sightings of AIC Hajatr, AIC Verndall, Segt Wagle, AIC Allis, AIC Derry, Segt Hatic, AIC Jenkin, and AIC Richardson. For was any information submitted with regard to the possible visual observation by aircraft at 0330 hours local, radar paint by weather radar at 0352, or exact time when the F-94 first entered the area of the sighting.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a text document discussing background information related to a UFO sighting.

DISCUSSION OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Weather conditions were such that there were haze and scattered clouds in the area of the sighting. There was also a temperature inversion at the 2 - 2,000 ft altitude level. Stars could be seen and this was indicated in all the AF Forms 117 submitted to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

A. The sighting was the brightest astronomical object in the skies during the period of the sighting. It has a stellar magnitude of -1.53, has characteristic colors of blue-red-white-green, and would have been visible in the south-eastern sky during most of the sighting. (See Atch #1)

B. The scintillation of Sirius would have been increased by the temperature inversion.

C. Celestial objects seen through haze are often misinterpreted. (See Atch #2)

D. Clouds passing in front of the star could have caused it to disappear and then reappear.

E. Stationary lights when seen against a black background can appear to move. This process is called autokinesis. (See Atch #3)

F. 1. Initial report indicated a simultaneous ground visual and air visual at about 0335 local. This was not substantiated by the pilot's own 377. The pilots indicated he sighted an unidentified item at about 0335 local.

- page 104 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, providing a detailed description of a sighting that occurred.

2. The B-52 arrived in the area on a 50 nautical mile radius glacerence and began vertical maneuvers, including a vertical "S" pattern. This took place at almost the same time as the first ground sighting. It is entirely possible that the initial sighting and the subsequent activities of the object were in fact the B-52 accomplishing upper airwork. Later sightings of bright lights and flashing green and white lights, accompanied by a low jet engine sound, corresponded with the B-52 making a VOR penetration, low approach, and missed approach. Portions of the maneuver are accomplished with the aircraft landing lights on. These layered cloud conditions could have diffused light sources and made identification difficult (ref TWX from Lt Col Warlich).

3. At 0435 local, the pilot of the B-52 sighted a bright light in the west-northwest on or near the ground. At 0439 Vega was on the horizon at azimuth 345 degrees.

C. Plasma and effects: electrical equipment and can also be noticed on radar.
1. Plasma, such as ball lightning, can occur in clear weather as well as stormy weather.
2. Plasma, such as ball lightning, can be seen visually and appear as a fiery ball. The most common colors are red, orange, yellow, blue and white.
3. Aurora borealis is quite often seen from Minot AFB at this time of the year and is an electrical atmospheric phenomenon.

SUBJECT UFO REORT

TO Director of Intoligenee 

Headquarters Air Force Systems Connuid
Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland

1. On 7 October 1968 at aporoximately 2330, a telephone call was received at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, from a civilian reported that he had observed a large, bright, unidentified flying object in the vicinity of the base. The caller stated that the object appeared to be hovering above the base and that it was lighting up the area on the base. The caller could furnish no other information on the object.

2. Upon receipt of the call, the Command Post at Minot AFB immediately contacted the Command Post of the 91st Strategic Missile Wing to determine if any unusual aerial activity had been observed or reported in the proximity of the base. The 91st SMN Command Post responded that no unusual sightings or activity had been reported.

3. The Command Post at Minot AFB then contacted the Security Controller on duty, who also reported that no unusual activity had been observed. The Security Controller was instructed to investigate the area and to attempt to locate the object.

4. After approximately 15 minutes the Security Controller reported that he could not locate any object in the sky over the base, nor could he determine the source of the original report.

5. No further action was taken and the incident was considered closed.

6. The above information is forwarded for your information.
