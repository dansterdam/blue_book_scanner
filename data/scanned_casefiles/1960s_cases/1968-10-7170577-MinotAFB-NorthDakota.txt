11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    SEE CASE FILE

COMMENTS: The ground visual sighting appears to be of the star Sirius and the B-52 which was flying the area. The B-52 radar contact and the temporary loss of UHF transmission could be attributed to plasma, similar to ball lightning. The air-visual from the B-52 could be the star Vega which was on the horizon at the time, or it could be a light on the ground, or possibly a plasma.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                   24 October 1968

Subject: UFO Observation, Minot AFB, North Dakota, 24 October 1968

At about 1730 hours the FTD Duty Officer called Lt Marano and said that they had a pretty important UFO sighting from Minot AFB. I (Lt Marano) asked him what it was about and he said the only information he had was that the crew of a B-52 had sighted and photographed an UFO and that the Base Commander and Major General Nichols of the 15th Air Force were both interested. I got back to the office at about 1745 hours, called Col Quintanilla and told him of the sighting, then called Minot and talked to Lt Col Werlich, the UFO investigator, 897-1850 ext 3020 or 2231.

I asked him if he wanted immediate reaction from our office and he said no, that he hadn't necessarily wanted us to call him back that night and that our Duty Officer was really more excited than he was. However, since it was such an unusual sighting he wanted to know if we could help him in any way.

I asked him the details of the sighting and he gave them.

At about 0300 hours local, a B-52 that was about 39 miles northwest of Minot AFB and was making practice penetrations sighted an unidentified blip on their radar. Initially the target traveled approximately 2½ mile in 3 sec or at about 3,000 ml/hr. After passing from the right to the left of the plane it assumed a position off the left wing of the 52. The blip stayed off the left wing for approximately 20 miles at which point it broke off. Scope photographs were taken. When the target was close to the B-52 neither of the two transmitters in the B-52 would operate properly but when it broke off both returned to normal function.


- page 3 -

At about this time a missile maintenance man called in and reported sighting a bright orangish-red object. The object was hovering at about 1000 ft or so, and had a sound similar to a jet engine. The observer had stopped his car, but he then started it up again. As he started to move the object followed him then accelerated and appeared to stop at about 6 - 8 miles away. The observer shortly afterward lost sight of it.

In response to the maintenance man's call the B-52, which had continued its penetration run, was vectored toward the visual which was about 10 mile northwest of the base. The B-52 confirmed having sighted a bright light of some type that appeared to be hovering just over or on the ground.

Fourteen other people in separate locations also reported sighting a similar object. Also, at this approximate time, security alarm for one of the sites was activated. This was an alarm for both the outer and inner ring. When guards arrived at the scene they found that the outer door was open and the combination lock on the inner door had been moved. The weather was generally misty, the temperature was 28 - 29 deg F and the wind 5 - 10 knots.

He did not have all the information such as: Whether it had been painted by the radars at the control tower? If control tower personnel had sighted anything unusual? If he had computed the azimuth and elevation from the fourteen witnesses to determine if they were looking at the same object or if they could have been possibly looking at stellar bodies? He didn't know whether anyone had seen a physical object or if they had just seen lights. Also, Col Wertlich did not have an exact time sequence for the events. Col Quintanilla told Col Wertlich that "without this information there wasn't too much he could do.

Col Wertlich agreed and said that he would gather the information.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: 24 Oct 68 UFO Sighting from Minot AFB, N. D.

At 11:15, 28 Oct 68, Sgt Jones received a call from Col Neyant, HQ SAC, Offutt AFB, Nebr.

He wanted to know how we received the UFO report from Minot AFB. Sgt Jones informed him it was received by phone.

Wanted to know what interest we take in a report like this and what we do when we receive the report. Sgt Jones told him it should have been given to the UFO Investigator at Minot, but since it was phoned into Wright-Patterson, Lt Marano would get in-touch with the UFO Investigator at Minot. Col Neyant then said, "the Investigator would handle it in accordance with AFR 80-17." Sgt Jones told him that was right.

Col Neyant then said, "then you can't do anything until you receive their report", Sgt Jones said, thats right.

Col Neyant also wanted to know if there was any other reports for that period of time from that area, Sgt Jones told him to the best of his knowledge, he didn't think there was. Col Neyant said, who ever is handling the report to give him a call at 5556/4236. Sgt Jones informed that would be Lt Marano.

Subj: Call fm Col Wyatt, SAC Hqs

At 1250 hours, 28 Oct 68, Col Wyatt, called Lt Marano and wanted to know if
we (Lt Marano) had received any indication of any other reports from Minot.

Lt Marano informed him that we haven't received any other reports from that area.

We do get a copy of reports in accordance with AFR 80-17. Lt Marano told
Col Wyatt that Col Werlich at Minot was doing the investigation. Col
Werlich had called the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson who in turned called
Lt Marano and he (Lt M) called Col Quintanilla and they both called Col Werlich
back and Col Werlich said he would do the investigation. Col Wyatt said he was
trying to determine whether ADC had any known phenomena on radar. Col Wyatt
asked Lt Marano if we ever participated in any investigations. Very seldom
do we ever go out in the field. As far as Lt Marano was concerned Col
Werlich was quite competent and he didn't feel that Col Werlich needed any
additional help at this time. Col Wyatt said he gave Col Werlich the guidance
and he guessed that Col Werlich got our telephone number out of the regulation.

Col Wyatt said he felt that we couldn't give him any more information so he
ended the conversation.

Subject: UFO Sighting, 24 Oct 68, Minot AFB

On 29 October 1968, at 0945, Lt Marano called Minot AFB and asked for Col Werlich. It seems that Col Werlich is flying this morning so I talked to Mr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] said that he thought that Col Werlich had prepared the UFO report and it was either sent out this morning of would be sent out today.

Subj: Need for Additional Info on Minot Sightings

At 0900 hours, Lt Marano called Minot AFB, BaseOps, however, Col Werlich
was flying so Lt Marano spoke with Sgt Roy. Lt Marano requested that
Sgt Roy have Col Werlich obtain the following information and TWX it to our
office.

Have the navigator accompany someone and go out and interview the
individual observers at the missile sites. Information that is needed is:

1. When first observed
2. Duration
3. Course
4. Description
5. Az and elev when first seen
6. Az and elev when last seen
7. Could they also see stars

Obtain statements from aircraft personnel to include:

1. Speed of B-52 during radar paint
2. Time, duration of aircraft radar sighting
3. Time, duration and position of aircraft for visual sighting.
4. Why did they feel the light was an UFO, could it actually
have been a car, etc on the ground. Did the ground observers see
the airplane and the UFO both at the same time?
5. Is there more unusual (GEM) Did it paint anything?
was there an ECM operator on board, was he using his equipment?

Other:
Did RANDOM paint any UFOs while painting the aircraft.
What other radars are in the area? Did they paint any unidentified
targets? Are there sage sites in area?

We need a statement that the missile sites had been broken into before and
what results.

Did ground maintenance check the equipment out after the B-52 landed?

The following is to be sent to us by mail.

Map of area
Plot of flight path of B-52 from 0250 hours local, till landing, with time
sequence markings on plot.

Subj: Telephone conversation with Col Pullen, Hq SAC

On 29 October 1968 at 1530 hours, Col Quintanilla telephone Col Pullen, Hq SAC, autovan 631-3600 (regular ext 223), however he was at M335). Col Pullen wanted a brief run down on the Minot sightings. Col Quintanilla told Col Pullen that he thought that the aircraft transmission receiver might also have caused the blip since it occurred for only a short period of time. The weather could have been a factor since there was an inversion. Also, the complete sighting is listed as having occurred for almost two hours and fifteen minutes. I feel that some of the men were looking at celestial bodies because of the inversion, causing scintillation. There were a number of stars in the area at the time. Col Pullen said he would like to receive a preliminary report giving a quick look. Col Quintanilla told him he would however we have to get the times. This business of two hours or too long to make an accurate report. There was an inversion between 2 and 5 and later. I'm (Col Quintanilla) pretty sure it was either caused by an internal radar malfunction that also caused the blip or because of the inversion he might have also picked up an anomalous blip. Unfortunately, Col Werlich wasn't able to have them pull a quick inspection of the set. Col Pullen wanted to know if we sent anybody up there to investigate the sighting. We did not send anybody up because I only have four people on my staff, myself, an assistant, a secretary and an admin sergeant. I talked to Col Werlich for over thirty minutes and since this didn't appear to unusual I didn't send anyone up. Col Pullen requested that Col Quintanilla send a preliminary report so that he could give it to General Stewart to get this simmered down. Send it 850 SAC, attention Col Pullen. He requested that Col Quintanilla hit a little heavy on what has happened to other aircraft on occasions like this, this would help to play the issue down.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                        1 November 1968

Subj: Telephone conversation of 31 Oct 68, Col Werlich - Lt Marano

Col Werlich had the people fill out the AF Form 117, of course, he said, I monitored them while they filled them out, but I can't see where a navigator can help. What I did was take a blotter to get the angles and show them what 60,90 etc angles were.

The descriptions of this will take care of these sightings also. The courses were quite varied over a couple of hours and the aircraft took many courses. It will be interesting to cross check its path with the RAPCON versus the ground observers. Most of the original sightings were of the aircraft.

The one we (Lt Marano) are mainly interested is the one that cannot be identified. The one of radar and the aircraft correlated pretty well. Col Werlich said Lt Marano should get a section map of the area. Base Ops at Wright-Patterson has hundreds of the sectional maps of the Minot area.

Look on map, half way down the runway, TACAN, 320 radios, 16 nautical miles. This is where aircraft saw the object. There's farm fields there. There is nothing there that would produce this type of light. The same for O'Connor and Nicely from November 7 which is near Grace. I have gone over that area with a chopper. This weekend I would like to go down with a geiger counter and go down to the OSCAR 7 break-in. (Col Werlich)


- page 19 -

Here is the text from the document:

think you will find that the most information comes from Airman
O'Connor and Isley, and an aircraft inspector. Much of their
discussion and description incorporates the activity of the B-52.
It was only at the end that I was unable to pin point the fact
that they did observe a light source and the B-52. You can
see the lights of the base for at least 50 miles away. I (Col W)
asked if they saw the B-52 come towards the object. We know
the 52 got real close to it. Did they see the object on the
ground? (Lt M asked). They were able to see a light source
while the 52 got in real close then it disappeared.

Lt Marano asked if it was going with the wind and explained
how we have had trouble with hot air balloons and he gave the
description, duration, etc.

Col Meridith informed Lt Marano that if he was familiar with
the geography he would see why this wouldn't be possible.

There must be four or five farm houses within a ten miles radius
and Grand with six to ten small dwellings and the area is
deserted at this time of the morning. I doubt that there would
be any activity like this. The sighting was about eleven miles
from November 7 site. This is a sensitive subject. Anybody
that could unlock the padlock wouldn't be a prankster from the
farm areas. There are keys for these padlocks and it's hard to

2


- page 20 -

Judge how many keys have been made. It looks like a Navy hatch and underneath is the combination lock. Pranksters just couldn't go and open it. The person, if it was a person, would have to know how to open it. We have had about three occurrences of this in the last two or three years doing this. All three of these cases were traced back to AP's. Guys who had been in the service on these areas. It is not a serious offense. 99 chances out of 100, that if a person, a human being, accomplished this thing then it had to be somebody who had a key to the padlock.

Lt Marano told Col Werlich that we have no evidence though that the UFO events did this. Col Werlich agreed but said that a Lieutenant examined the area the next day and could find no evidence of cars, tire tracks, footprints, etc. Col Werlich said he didn't know if an examination investigation was going on or not but felt they probably were looking into it. Lt Marano asked him to get the results of their investigation. Col Werlich said he was trying to take a positive approach towards this investigation. Almost 50 per cent were looking at the B 52. If you would take a look at an aircraft at 20,000 ft, then you wouldn't see much but I'm an to place logic in that it was there and what they saw was there. There is enough there that it is worth looking at. Nobody can definitely say that these people definitely saw the aircraft, but within reason they probably saw it. Lt Marano told Col Werlich that SAC was giving us trouble because they wanted to know what we are

doing. Thursday afternoon I (Col Werlick) called, with the
personal opinion that we needed technical assistance at that
time and that is what we requested and we didn't get it and
we have tried to do what we could. Gen Hollingsworth is
interested.

Anyway, I'm sending the RAPCON TAPES, PHOTOS, and an overlay
showing a movement of the aircraft, description of the aircraft
movement prior to VFR. Aircraft was going through maneuvers
and it would be most impossible to track it perfectly come he
was doing steep turns, "S" turns, etc. Now time and duration
of the sighting was in my message. Speed of the B-52 was in the
TWX. I only stated one radar in the message because there was
only one radar set. The ECM equipment hadn't been used.
RAPCON was patting, IFF equipment was operating in the airplane.

It's a fairly good size blip. Every time it sweeps it
shows the blip. This object would have been covered by the blip.
There is a base site to the south. They do not remember having any
unidentified paints. The only one I have is the one on the plane.

The unusual part is the B-52 was in the middle of a sentence
and the voice just quit transmitting right in the middle of
the word. Because we had an accident a couple of weeks ago
we were quite interested. Ground control asked then if they
had any trouble to give May Squawk. The airplane changed
both UHF and neither would transmit but they could receive,
and each time to show that they could receive they hit the
mike to squawk which would last for thirty seconds each time.


- page 22 -

There was quite a bit of this. The navigator was the paint disappear as fast as it appeared. My personal opinion is that it couldn't be a malfunction because they transmitted before and afterwards. The aircraft was not checked out afterwards because the transmission was working. I don't know if the heavy haze would have been enough to blank out the transmission. Lt Marano explained that we do not have a good time sequence. Col Werlich said he tried to start with the first things first in his TWX. The most important things are the AF Forms 117 and the transcription with RADCON. Lt Marano then explained about the many astronomical bodies that were over the area at the time and when there is quite an inversion they are magnified even greater. Col Werlich said some of the observers could see stars and others couldn't. He had a Ragged Ann type of cover. So many layers of haze, quite a layer of haze. Col Werlich then put Sgt Dickson from the weather office on the telephone. Sgt Dickson was sending us complete weather data, however, he said we should be able to obtain the weather from the base weather office at Wright-Patterson since they get it as it comes off the wires. The weather data Sgt Dickson used was obtained from Glasgow.

The following data was given:
2000 Ft alt       temperature   +40 cent       Dew point -34° cent
3600                             +10.5°                  -22°
5000                             9.0°                    0°
6500                             1.0°                   -50°
11,500                                                  -40°

- page 23 -

Here is the text from the document:

There was a pretty good temperature inversion.

Col Werlich said he would send an overlay for the 200 series map chart which is used by the bomb people in the targeting section and the people over at W-9 should have the master chart.

The chart is classified so to save time, signatures, etc, Col Werlich is just sending the overlay so that we can put it over the chart that the Bomb Navy targeting people for the 200 series chart.

Gen Hollingsworth has been given all the information that Col Werlich obtained. Col Werlich said that Gen Hollingsworth was briefing Gen Compton and this briefing was probably going on at the time that Col Werlich was speaking with Lt Marano (time was approx 2 pm, EST, 31 Oct.). Col Werlich said that you had to realize that there is only one person looking at the radar sent. He didn't take scope photos at first until the pilot said why don't you take some photos. This was towards the end. They had it visually all the way down. Each scope photos is three seconds. There is nothing of value in the conversation. The blip changes shape, round, rectangular, etc.

Col Werlich said he would be flying tomorrow and Monday. Col Werlich said he had done the initial investigation in accordance with the regulation and I'm at the limit of my capabilities.

Col Werlich I can send supplemental data and will if we make our desires known and inform what specific information we need. Col Werlich said we were hoping for technical assistance.

and we didn't get it. It Marano told Col Werlich we felt that

no was doing an adequate job as far as technical data. Col

Werlich said thes was his first report and didn't know how

to ask questions or anything and he had spent too much time

on it already.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                       1 November 1968

Talked to Mr Goff, TDPA, who is quite familiar with air-borne radars. Mr Goff said that from the evidence available at this time it would appear to him that the sightings may have been precipitated by some type of ionized air plasma similar to ball light-ning. He felt that a plasma could account for the radar blip, loss of transmission and some of the visual sightings. The entry of the missile site is being investigated by local authorities and with the information at our disposal at this time no explanation is offered.

At 0308 hours the initial report was received from a maintenance team enroute from Nov-8 to Nov-7. An AIC O'Connor was the maintenance team Chief and he stated that all members of the team observed the lighted object. They further stated that it was reddish orange in color, a very large object, with flashing green and white lights. After they entered N-7 LF they observed came directly over head with the sound of jet engines.

SSgt Bond the FSO at Nov Flt stated that the object which looked to him as the sun, came near the head antenna at Nov-1. It then moved to the right and he sent the SAT out to check and see what it was. The object then moved about one mile SSE of Nov-1. They came within 1/2 mile from where it appeared to be landing. When it reached surface the lights became dimmer and finally went out. After this they could see nothing. SSgt Smith at Osage-1 saw the object separate in two parts and go in opposite directions and pass under each other.

At this time Julai Flt and Mike Flt Team observed the same thing and described it the same way. The approximate grid coordinates of the apparent landing was at 14-43. The entire observation period as near as can be determined was about 15 minutes.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

0800. Object 8/9 of N-7 moving toward site with brilliant light like the 
sun. Lights flashing on and off. Tip too brilliant and big for an aircraft 
now moving south and hovered over N-7, turned green, amber off than on.

0819. Below 1,000 feet, hovored somewhat, when no turns like a jet - 
straight forward shot.

0819. Moving NW will white light on.

0820. Object now appears one mile away and moving in on them.

0825. Object now revealed direction and moving from site, now 600 feet 
from site and lower from 800 feet.

0828. Two are seen now. Jet engines heard now very clearly.

0829. Moving S/W of site and gaining altitude.

0830. Just as in sight now when it passed over site it looked like 
two headlights. Moving real slow when overhead - could hear engines.

0813. Disappeared - moved 8/9 to far from eyesight.

0835. Disappeared for 3 minutes then reappeared. Same spot and moving 
back toward N-7.

0838. Coming out of S/9 once more.

0840. Hovering 3 miles away 1 to 2000 feet very dim white light.

0841. Moving toward N-7 again, light getting brighter. Hovering.

0842. In one position.

0843. White lights went out, green light on and moving rapidly now.

0845. Light gone out and white light coming back on.

0850. Object N/W, reversed and moving off again S/9.

0852. Disappeared than reappears and again back N-7. From S/9, lights 
getting brighter.

0856. Still moving from S/9.

0857. Object now west 1 to 2000 feet. Red flashing light moving N/W.

0857. Now approximately 600 feet. Red flashing light moving N/W.

0858. Now white light hovering 500 to 1000 feet. Lights now flashing white.

0920. Object direct S/W of S/1 moving north then lights went out.

0921. Went out to location of sighting and saw object and had on radar 20,000 feet.

Object followed B-52 to fifteen miles from base. During this time B-52 lost 
radio contact on all frequencies. At this time N-7 lost sight of object.

0910. B-52 landed.

0942. N-7 picked up object again 3 miles west of site. Stationary - seems 
to be on the ground - light was bright orange then illuminated to white then 
white disappeared and green came on.

0944. Disappeared.

0945. In night - stationary position.

1001. Object has moved - still west of N-7. Now stationary once more.

0830    Controllers received information on UFO 24 miles NW

0834    JAG 31 & B-52 on 24 calibration check to WP 11 requested clearance to WP at
        FL200

0834 no MIG approach control does JAG 31 have clearance to WP fix at FL200?

0835 or    JAG 31 roger clear cut on a heading of 250 climb and maintain 5000 stand-by
        for higher altitude we're trying to get it from center now

0835 ct    JAG 31 climb and maintain FL200

0835 no    Roger 31 leaving 5000 for 200

0835 ct    JAG 31 on your way out to the WP fix request you look out toward your
        1400 position for the next 15 or 16 miles and see if you see any orange
        glow out there

0835 no    Roger roger... close 31

0852 no    31 go ahead

0852 ct    31 the UFO is being picked up by western radar also, should be your 1400
        position 3 miles now

0852 no    We have nothing on our airborne radar and I'm in some pretty thick haze right
        now and unable to see out that way

0852 ct    roger

0852 ct    JAG 31 upon reaching the WP fix you're cleared for approach report leaving
        FL200

0852 no    Roger 31

0854 ct    JAG 31 roger report leaving FL200

0855 ct    Approach control this is JAG 31

0855 ct    JAG 31 about approach

0856 no    We'd like a straight Texas approach, low approach nw 11 then a vector around
        for a GCA low approach

0856 ct    After completion of low approach climb and maintain 3200 climb heading 335
        report steady... 31 roger leaving 200 on this approach

The object 800 oclock panelers were occurred basically in one general area. It stayed pretty well S.S.E. of the launch facility but had several times started northward and westward always returning to it's previous (SSE) position. For some reason it appeared to be trying to travel west but we never did see it take the direct path. Area the B-52 flew in the vicinity (SSE) it was no longer seen in that location. We placed had started to travel after it was out of sight back to S.N.A. Our attention was again caught where it appeared approx. 5 miles due west where it finally disappeared about 15 minutes afterwards.

REFERENCE OUR TELCON WITH REGARDS TO MINOT AFB UFO'S. IT IS MY
FEELINGS, AFTER REVIEWING PRELIMINARY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY MINOT,
THAT UFO PAINTED BY B-52 ON RADAR AND ALSO OBSERVED VISUALLY BY IP
AND PERSONNEL ON GROUND IS MOST PROBABLY A PLASMA OF THE BALL-LIGHTNING
CLASS. PLASMAS OF THIS TYPE WILL PAINT ON RADAR AND ALSO AFFECT SOME
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AT CERTAIN FREQUENCIES. PLASMAS ARE NOT
UNCOMMON, HOWEVER, THEY ARE UNIQUE AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DUPLICATE
IN THE LABORATORY. ALSO BECAUSE OF TIME DURATIONS, FEEL STRONGLY
THAT SOME SECURITY GUARDS AND MAINTENANCE CREW WERE OBSERVING SOME
FIRST MAGNITUDE CELESTIAL BODIES WHICH WERE GREATLY MAGNIFIED BY
THE INVERSION LAYER AND HAZE WHICH WAS PRESENT AT MINOT DURING THE
TIME OF THE UFO OBSERVATIONS.
DO NOT CONSIDER THE PHYSICAL VIOLATION OF THE LOCK AS BEING RELATED
IN ANY WAY WITH UFO'S.
I CONSIDER THE UFO REPORTS AS FAIRLY ROUTINE, EXCEPT FOR THE PLASMA
OBSERVATION WHICH IS INTERESTING FROM A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW.
WE WILL STUDY THIS REPORT IN MORE DETAIL WHEN WE RECEIVE THE
RAW DATA FROM MINOT.

1. Reference ASD message 971846, with regard to evaluations of
reports from Minot AFB. The following conclusions have been
reached after a thorough study of the visual sightings reported
technologically by USAF. The ground visual sightings appear to be of
two star fields near the B-52 with no known explanation. The
visual sightings could be interpreted to a gross sighting to will
be difficult to a plane sighting to will be difficult to be
sure if it could be a light on the wing, or possibly a plane
light, or it could be a light on the wing of possibly a plane
sighted. No further investigation by the Foreign Technology Division
is contemplated.

2. No further investigation by the Foreign Technology Division is
contemplated. Your message will receive a copy of this

RESUME

Airman Isley stated that he observed the object from 0930 to 0430, for 3½ to 4 hours. It was seen south of his position, first being seen in the east and disappearing in the southeast. The lights looked like the lights of a jet aircraft and it came within hearing distance twice. The sound was that of jet engines.

During the period of observation it went out of sight a few times and then reappeared. At one time he sighted two objects. Also sighted B-52 on its first pass.

AIC O'Conner, who was with Airman Isley, stated that he saw the UFO from 0230 to 0345 hours. (No explanation for conflict in duration.) The light was seen moving in various directions in the southern skies. The object appeared as a self-luminous big ball of white light that seemed to change to a green light, then later to a dim amber color. Heard a noise similar to that of a jet aircraft. A B-52 in the area was asked to check out the sighting and was seen west of the object. The object did not appear again after the B-52 made its first pass (B2 made pass at about 0335 hours).

AIC Jablonski, who was dispatched by SSgt Bond to November 1 with Airman Isley and AIC O'Conner, reported that he sighted the object for two hours off and on. The object was self luminous with glowing orange-red, white, and greenish alternating and at times

combinations could be seen. When first dispatched, sighted another object exactly the same as that which appeared out of the east end moved toward the other. A B-52 was diverted to the general area.

First seen and heard about 35 minutes after first sighting of object. Object stayed basically to the southeast, while B-52 was in southwesterly position.

AIC Adams, who was dispatched with AIC Jablonski, also stated that he sighted the object for about two hours in the southern skies. The UFO seemed to assume a stationary position, first in a hovering position, then it would speed up. The reddish orange light kept changing white and occasionally green. B-52 bomber heard approximately 45 minutes after seeing UFO. B-52 went and much higher than UFO.

SSgt Bond sighted the object in the southern skies for two hours twenty-six minutes. The UFO appeared as a point of light. It appeared about the same as landing lights on the B-52 which was diverted to the area, except for the flashing red lights on the B-52.

SSgt Smith sighted the UFO from 0230 to 0415 hours. It was seen primarily in the south-southeast off and on for 1 hour 15 minutes.

The object appeared as though a star would appear on the horizon on a clear night. The phenomenon appeared to be a reddish burnt orange. SSgt Smith saw it fade and change as a star might twinkle.

He also noticed a slight hint of green. The object resembled the planet Mars, in color and size, as it rises on the horizon.

Major Martin, the pilot of the B-52, visually sighted an unidentified light from 0430 till 0435 hours local. It appeared as a bright orange ball of light about 15 miles away in the west-northwest, and was either on the ground or slightly above the ground.

The light remained stationary as he flew toward it. He turned onto base leg about one mile south of the light and was above it. The light did not move during this time.

No detailed information was submitted to this office relative to the sightings of AIC Bagliar, AIC Pennedall, SSgt Wagle, AIC Allis, AIC Derr, SSgt Haiku, AIC Jenkins, and AIC Richardson. Nor was any information submitted with regards to the possible visual observation by aircraft at 0335 hours local, radar paint by weathers radar at 0352, or exact time when the B-52 first entered the area of the sightings.

DISCUSSION OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Weather conditions were such that there was haze and scattered clouds in the area of the sighting. There was also a temperature inversion at the 2 - 5,000 ft altitude level. Stars could be seen and this was indicated in all the AF Forms 117 submitted to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

A.

1. Sirius was the brightest astronomical object in the skies during the period of the sightings. It has a stellar magnitude of -1.58, has characteristic colors of blue-red-white-green, and would have been visible in the southeastern sky during most of the sightings. (See Atch #1)

2. The scintillation of Sirius would have been increased by the temperature inversion.

3. Common celestial objects when seen through haze are often misinterpreted. (See Atch #2)

4. Clouds passing in front of the star would have caused it to disappear and then reappear.

5. Stationary lights when seen against a black background can appear to move. This process is called autokinesis. (See Atch #3)

B.

1. Initial report indicated a simultaneous ground visual and air visual at about 0335 local. This was not substantiated by the pilot's form 117. The pilot indicated he sighted an unidentified light at about 0335 local.


- page 104 -

2. The B-52 arrived in the area on a 50 nautical mile radius clearance and began various maneuvers including a vertical "S" pattern. This took place at almost the same time as the first ground sighting. It is entirely possible that the initial sighting and the subsequent activities of the object were in fact the B-52 accomplishing upper airwork. Later sightings of bright lights and flashing green and white lights, accompanied by a low jet engine sound, correlate with the B-52 making a VQ3 penetration, low approach, and missed approach. Portions of the maneuver are accomplished with the aircraft landing lights on. The haze layered cloud conditions could have diffused light sources and made identification difficult (ref TWX from Lt Col Morloch).

3. At 0435 local, the pilot of the B-52 sighted a bright light in the west-northwest on or near the ground. At 0435 Vega was on the horizon at azimuth 345 degrees.

C.

1. Plasmas can effect electrical equipment and can also be painted on radar.

2. Plasmas, such as ball lightning, can occur in clear weather as well as stormy weather.

3. Plasmas, such as ball lightning, can be seen visually and appear as a fiery ball. The most common colors are red, orange, yellow, blue and white.

4. Aurora Borealis is quite often seen from Minot AFB at this time of the year and is an electrical atmospheric phenomenon.
