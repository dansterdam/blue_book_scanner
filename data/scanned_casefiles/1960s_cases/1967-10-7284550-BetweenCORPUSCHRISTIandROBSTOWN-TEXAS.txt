COMMENTS: Apparently the observer saw the same object both night. She seems to see things quite often. The investigating officer wrote, "These numerous sightings have caused the observer local alarm and the appearance so always between 2000 and 2100 hrs on the 16th and 2100 hrs on the 19th. The object seem to disappear toward the Corpus Christi area. There were 30 aircraft operating between 2000 and 2100 hrs on the 16th. The observer was sent a 16y but failed to return it, although the reporting seems to be of aircraft, without the duration, this evaluation cannot be made."

Reference: TDPT/UFO

Dear Major Quintanilla:

On October 18, 1967, the Tower recorded thirty (30) operations between the hours of 2000 and 2100 local time. These operations were as follows: 1 air carrier, 5 civil itinerant, 16 civil local, 4 Navy itinerant, and 4 Navy local. On October 19, 1967, from 2000 to 2100 local time, 5 operations were recorded by the Tower. They were 5 air carrier and 2 civil itinerant. These flights were at a low altitude while take-offs were accomplished.

None of the air traffic controllers in the Tower saw anything unusual. There were no reports received at the Airport on these nights about any unusual objects.

We have no theories or explanations as to why an observer reported anything of an unusual nature on the nights of October 18-19, 1967.

Very truly yours,
[Signature]
William D. Wilder
Airport Manager
