77. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

NOTE Ques 13819. I would not want to say as I could not give a very good answer for lack of experience in such things.

I have an interest in astronomy, aircraft etc., and have never seen such a phenomenon before. It is my impression that it was not a planet (too large and have never seen a planet look like it) or an Aircraft (it did not carry required lights and was not in an air lane).

10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?

TXN
During the sighting, there was a thick cloud cover in the West, which covered all stars but the phenomenon. Stars were visible in the North, East, South and directly overhead.

[Form sections filled out with checkmarks and notes include:]

Weather: Clear
Time: Night
Stars: A Few
Moon: No Moonlight, don't remember

Illumination Source: None (other than light through window in home)

12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER EDGES WERE SHARP OR FUZZY. DESCRIBE THE SHAPE OR INDICATE IF IT APPEARED AS A POINT OR LIGHT. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

The phenomenon was self-luminous. It was could be compared to a very large star. It did not look like any other star. It also changed color from red to light read and back again at the rate of approximately once every second.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
A very bright light in the sky. I did not, however, spot this phenomenon first as my mother saw it before I did. It did not resemble a star etc.

4. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It finally disappeared below the horizon.

9. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

See Item #6.

It was a very bright flashing light. It did not have any other lights near it.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH.
