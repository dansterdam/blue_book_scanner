Proposed reply to [redacted] (Sighting: July 26, 1967)                                     AUG 14 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object on July 26, 1967.

Investigation has revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus. At approximately 9:30 pm, EDT, on July 26, 1967, Venus would have been on an azimuth of 275 degrees, at an elevation of eight degrees.

You stated, "... Venus at this time of the year is not even close or even on the horizon line." According to the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac 1967, Venus set at approximately 10:00 pm, EDT on July 26, 1967. Thus, the planet would have been near the horizon at 9:30 pm EDT.

You also mentioned that when viewed with binoculars the object at first appeared somewhat fuzzy or blurred. This is normally expected since the images formed by binocular lenses often show spherical aberration.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sirs;

The many books I have read say that when you see a UFO to report it. Well this is what happened. I am using a copy of your questionnaire.

I saw the object July 26,1967 at close to 9:30pm Daylight Saving time. The time zone was Eastern. I was at the address above.

The object was in sight some 15min. Which is just a mess. It seemed that long. The object was in sight all the time. The condition of the sky was NIGHT, a.Bright there were no stars at that time. There was a clear sky the weather was dry. The object appeared as a light. The object was so bright I at first thought it was Venus but as anyone knows Venus at this time of year is not even close or even on the horizon line.

At first glance appeared as a very bright star and when I put the Binoculars on it, it was fuzzy or blued and as I kept watching it became more clear and looked to have something close to it. The object looked to stand still and change brightness, it looked to give off a lot of that gale hair you use at Christmas, but this was silver or gray color. Then a red ball of light left the main part of the object and went to the North West.

Then there were silver small about the size of min heads objects near the Angle hair like material. There 3-4 of these small objects. There. Then they seem to move up and away at a good speed. Much faster then the red ball object did. As I said before there were no clouds in the area at the time. There was no sound to the object or later objects. You ask to try that experiment with a match. It was big enough that a dime would just cover it. I would say that the object had to be at least 5,000 feet or more. I am an amateur astronomer and was on my skywatch as usual.

I spend up to two hours and some times more out at night. I have been with astronomy now 10 years. The object was at 90 degrees right overhead.

If I had had a 35mm camera you would have some good pictures with this sighting.

I have seen satellites all kinds of jets at all nights all types of Aircraft. I have seen motors and as I said before I have been with Astronomy for ten years.

I reported the sighting the same evening

First I called the Allegheny Airport tower (control)
Next I called the Pittsburgh Press and ask if anyone had reported an object
they said no.

Next I called the Dauhl Planetarium which they in turn gave me a story about a weather balloon. Now I ask you sense when does a weather balloon act like this did.

I hoped I have helped in some way with this report to you.
