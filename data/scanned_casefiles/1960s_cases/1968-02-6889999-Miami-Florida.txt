The observer sighted four objects on the night of 17 Feb and can on the night of 22 Feb 68, all 5 rose from about the same spot on the horizon and each was described as looking like an orange ball very much like fireworks, roman candle type. Several of the objects were observed to drop off sparks before burning out.

The text on the page is a handwritten narrative in cursive script. While some words are clearly legible, the entire text is difficult to transcribe with complete certainty. The page is labeled at the bottom right as "PAGE 9 OF 9 PAGES" and at the top is a printed header that reads: "INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING."

The handwriting appears to be a detailed description of some kind of observation or event, but due to the cursive nature and varying legibility, I cannot confidently reproduce the entire text verbatim. Some words and phrases are clear, but a full accurate transcription would require careful line-by-line deciphering.

UFO Observation, 17 and 18 February 1963

Miami, Florida 33156

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observations of 17 and 18 February 1963. We feel that you might have been watching campus bag hot air balloons, especially in the neighborhoods of colleges and universities. Enclosed is a brief description of this type of observation.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

GARNET BAG HOT AIR BALLOONS

Hot Air Balloons, made out of garnet bags, usually appear as a red, orange, yellow or white light in the sky and may remain aloft as long as ten or fifteen minutes. If they are fairly close, they may appear as two objects, one on top of the other. The bottom object is the heat source and is quite bright; the upper half glowing object is the garnet bag. Usually the heat source is on a beach wood platform. When the object is aloft it may move in an erratic manner or a straight trajectory, depending on the wind. The bottom also flashes and flickers as the wind blows the candles. When the candles burn down, the platform may catch fire and sometimes causes sparks and pieces of burning debris to fall; however, they usually burn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after the sparks stop falling, the object disappears.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
