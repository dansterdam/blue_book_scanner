37. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:

The object when first sighted to be about 5000 feet at west I thought it was an aircraft with its landing light on. But the object was standing still. After approximately eight minutes the object went straight up in the air to about 14000 feet, hovered, and stopped. I checked with all air traffic control. They said and there was no reported aircraft at that position.

After about 10 minutes of standing still, it started drifting to the west at about 5 mph. It then stopped again. After being now in the stopped position for about six minutes the object departed to the south till it finally disappeared.

[There is also a small hand-drawn diagram showing the object's movement, labeled "Object Movement" with an arrow indicating its path near "Nellis Tower" and "Side View"]
