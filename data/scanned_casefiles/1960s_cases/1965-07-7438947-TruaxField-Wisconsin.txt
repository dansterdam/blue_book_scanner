The evidence submitted in this report (CHOIN 22000 26 Jul 65) is too meager to allow a firm evaluation to be made. However, by a process of elimination it appears that the speed of the target was too slow for a meteor, but the speed and altitude are compatible for a high performance (possibly experimental) aircraft. There being no reason to consider the targets as false, or the radar as malfunctioning, the high performance aircraft remains the most logical explanation.
