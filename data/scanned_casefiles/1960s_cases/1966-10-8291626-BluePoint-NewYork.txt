The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes a section for "Physical Evidence" and a weather report questionnaire.

Physical Evidence: Were photographs taken or was any physical evidence of the object left behind? (Note: If the caller says there is physical evidence still present, contact Wing Operations Duty Officer through CAC, Ext 493, or the Air Police, Ext 408, immediately).

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document containing only text.

The text in the document reads:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your DD report in the morning.

One final note: Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the TAC. Ext 499. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
