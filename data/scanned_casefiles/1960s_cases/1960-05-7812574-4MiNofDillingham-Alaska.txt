Round object with projection at the ends of center line. There was a red band on the object between the projections. On the bottom were two appendages which moved in an undulating motion. Also, on the center bottom was a half moon shaped object which whirled at varying speeds. The object was about as big as an automobile and silver in color.

WITHIN 200 FEET OF THEM. SEVERAL OF THE OBSERVERS
DREW SKETCHES WHICH WERE VERY SIMILAR. WHEN THE
OBJECT ROSE INTO THE AIR, A SUCKING NOISE WAS HEARD
AND GRASS WAS SUCKED UP FROM THE GROUND. ONE OF
THE OBSERVERS, A DEAF-MUTE, POSSIBLY INDICATED THAT
A 5 GALLON CAN WAS SUCKED UP, BUT THIS WAS NOT
ASCERTAINABLE FOR SURE. IN THE PAST, NATIVES HAVE
OFTEN PROVED TO BE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE OBSERVERS

Here is the text I can clearly read from the document:

SUSPECTED THAT THEY ARE, AND THAT SUGGESTION AND A NATURAL TENDENCY TO EXAGGERATE A FIRE COULD CAUSE SOME PARTS OF STATIC SPOT IN THE CANARD PERHAPS COULD ALSO BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FANTASTIC PART OF THE RESULT.

IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGHT WAS A US OREGON AUTHORITY WAS ACTED MOMENT FIRE NEAR LATE THE TIME OF THE EXPERIMENT.

Alaska National Guard, did not see the object, but was the person who reported the sighting. He stated that many people, saw the object after it was well up in the air, but he had heard of no one other than those listed below who saw it at close range. In a town the size of Dillingham, news travels fast and if anyone else had seen it, probably would have heard of it.

[Redacted] saw the object at close range. He is a deaf-mute native and communicated his sighting to his brother. The following account was given by [redacted], speaking for his brother.

He was in the yard of the house when he saw the object flying along the ridge. He noticed that it was creating considerable suction, in fact, enough to pick up two empty five gallon fuel tins and swirl them in the air before the object. He was alarmed because some very small children were playing in the area and he was afraid they would be sucked up. The object passed about 50 to 100 feet from him and just cleared electric wires estimated 12 feet above ground. Apparently the cars were carried from one side of the ridge on which the houses stand, to the other, a distance of possibly 100 yards. The object passed between the houses, dipped slightly into the ravine and descended at an extremely high rate of speed. As it landed, it swirled dead grass from the meadow high into the air after it.

(Figure 1) and described it as follows: It was quite round with a projection at the ends on the center line. Whether this was "fore and aft" or a flange all the way around could not be determined. There was a red band on the object between the projections. On the bottom were two appendages which moved in an undulating motion (the motion was described with arm movements). Also, in the center bottom, was a half moon shaped object which whirled at varying speeds. Apparently, when the object ascended rapidly, it whirled very fast. According to [redacted], the angle of incidence to the object of these appendages and half moon changed, but because of language difficulty, it was impossible to determine what relationship this had with the movement of the object except that it possibly occurred when it turned. The object was about as big as an automobile and was silvery in color. He felt certain it was not a balloon and was metallic. It was impossible to determine the three dimensional shape of the object. It is difficult to assess the reliability of these persons but it is probably at least average.

Another possible witness was [redacted] when living in an outlying village. He was not interviewed because he understood that [redacted] was at the house and had heard the object make a loud sucking noise when it ascended. He was not sure whether he had seen the object.

20/0500Z, May 1960, established the time of initial sighting at approximately Dillingham and was seated at the rear window of his establishment. He noticed the object come into view from behind some buildings. The object was near the ridge and approximately paralleling the ridge. He described the object as the size of a light airplane at that distance, silvery in color and football shaped. When shown the drawing (figure 1), he stated it did not seem so round to him. He was unable to discern any details at that distance (about 2 miles) except that it did not have wings. The object appeared to be moving slowly. From the window there is a clear view of the ridge and

house. The reliability of [redacted] is difficult to estimate, but he was not evasive and some details of his story correlated with that of intelligence.

There was some language difficulty.

[Redacted] was flying in a light plane at 2500 feet near Ekuk, south of Dillingham at 20/0652, May 1960. He saw people on the ground looking up and in trying to find what they were looking at, saw the object at an estimated 10,000 feet and nearly above him. He stated it was round and silver, with a small trapezoidal object below it and a much smaller object of indeterminable shape below that. He described the trapezoidal object as not more than one-fifth the size of the round object, flat, and with the horizontal sides parallel. (Figure 2). He stated that the round object was very large, much larger than the incendiary balloons floated over from Japan during WWII. He said he felt, could climb up to the object, but did not as fog was enveloping the airfield at Dillingham and he was afraid to waste the time.

He could give no other details. He was a barge operator and pilot. He seemed to tell a straight forward story and the object was in that location at the time indicated.

Additional Information: At the time of the sightings, the weather was described as clear, and a breeze of about 15 miles per hour was blowing and that the object was headed pretty much into the wind. The object came from approximately 50 degrees true and ascended on a heading of approximately 215 degrees true (figure 3). It was last seen almost due south of Dillingham over the village of Ekuk. The 705th ACWRON at King Salmon carried the following moves on a weather balloon: 20/0145Z KKQ3035, 0215Z GQ0H9, 0245 GQ0035, 0315 PQ 5830, 0445 PQ5023, D515 PQ 4845, 0545 PQ 3050. At 0545 contact lost and fade.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

There still appears to be no logical explanation of the sighting. It is quite obvious that an object was sighted. Whether all the details of the sighting are correct cannot be ascertained. However, there is no reason to doubt their essential accuracy. At any rate, it does not appear that a commonplace object such as an airplane or balloon was responsible for the sighting.
