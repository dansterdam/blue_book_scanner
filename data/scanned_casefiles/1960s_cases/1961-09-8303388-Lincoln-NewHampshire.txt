SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAF-OI 3b (Mrs Gaiser)
Wash 25 D C

27 SEP 1963

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted] requesting information on unidentified objects. Our records indicate fourteen specific requests from Mr. [redacted] pertaining to various sightings. He has also received the DOD Fact Sheet. This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Specific answers pertaining to the case of Sep 19-20, 1961 are as follows:

a. The Barney Hill sighting was investigated by officials from Pease AFB. The case is carried as insufficient data in the Air Force Files. No direction (azimuth) was reported and there are inconsistencies in the report. The sighting occurred about midnight and the object was observed for at least one hour. No specific details on maneuverability were given. The planet Jupiter was in the South West, at about 20 degrees elevation and would have set at the approximate time that the object disappeared. Without positional data the case could not be evaluated as Jupiter. There was a strong inversion in the area. The actual light source is not known. As no lateral or vertical movement was noted, the object was in all probability Jupiter. No evidence was presented to indicate that the object was due to other than natural causes.

b. The Air Force did not investigate the sightings in Hollywood, California, on Feb 5 and 6, 1960.

Part Two: An "abducted" woman describes her incredible experience
BY JOHN G. FULLER

RETURNING FROM a brief vacation in Canada in September, 1961, Barney and Betty Hill had a deeply disturbing experience that they could remember only vaguely. They had sighted what may have been an Unidentified Flying Object that seemed to be following their car. Their anxiety about the incident led them to the office of Dr. Benjamin Simon, the distinguished Boston psychiatrist, on December 14, 1963. Because of the cloudiness of the Hills' conscious recollection of the episode, Dr. Simon decided to use regression under hypnosis in the hope that this would help them reconstruct the event more clearly. He also decided to tape-record these sessions for later study and reference.

During World War II, Dr. Simon, as Chief of Neuropsychiatry and Executive Officer at Mason General Hospital, the Army's chief psychiatric center, had extensive experience with hypnosis in the treatment of many psychiatric disorders among military personnel.

Barney Hill, who is a Negro, told of the journey from the Canadian border to their home in Portsmouth, N. H., and described a glowing UFO that seemed to follow them during part of their trip. Under hypnosis, he recreated the scene in much greater detail, and the incident he had not mentioned during the earlier interview. The low-flying UFO had descended, Hill told the doctor, and humanoid creatures had then blocked the road. They had "abducted" him and carried him about the UFO for a strange physical examination. After several sessions with Barney, Dr. Simon decided to question Betty Hill, who is white, under hypnosis the following week.

Within the first moments of her trance, Betty Hill recalled a story that was remarkably similar to the one Dr. Simon had heard from her husband. After she and Barney made a number of stops in an attempt to reach a point in the road where they saw "men standing in the highway ... and these men started to come up to the car..." They came in two groups...

At that point, "a kind of daze" overcame her.

The men took them both from the car, she said. "... And I turn around, and I say: 'Barney! Wake up!' ... And he looks very, very attentive. He keeps walking."

One of the men walking beside Betty said: "Don't be afraid. We're not going to harm you."

DOCTOR: These men spoke good English?
BETTY: Only one spoke ... He had sort of a foreign accent... We kept walking, and came to a clearing... The object was on the ground... I think it was the same one I had been watching in the sky... And they're taking me up to the object. I didn't want to go on.

It. The man beside me says to go on... So he and one of the others each take my arms... I go inside, and there's a corridor. We go up the corridor, and there's a room... I turn around, and I'm waiting for them to bring Barney in.

But they had Barney right past the door where I'm standing. I said: What are you doing with Barney? Bring him in here where I am. And the man said: No, we only have equipment enough in one room and do not have space at a time.

And if we took you both in the same room, it would take too long... Another man comes in... I think he's a doctor... They push up the sleeve of my dress, and they look at my arm... and then they turn my arm over, and they look at the underside... And they rub, they have a machine... it's something like a microscope, only a microscope with a big lens... I had an idea they were taking a picture of my skin... And then they took something like a letter opener—only it wasn't—and they scrape my arm... And there was like little particles—you know—how your skin gets dry and flaky sometimes, like little particles of skin? And sometimes, they took a piece of cellophane or plastic or continued

something like that, and they scraped, and they
put the flakes on this plastic . . . And the leader
of the group puts it in the top drawer. And then
they put my head . . . in this thing that holds your
head . . . And the examiner opens my eyes and
looks into them with a light, and he opens my
mouth, and he looks in my throat and my teeth
and in my ears . . . And then he takes like a—oh,
a swab—and he puts it in my left ear, and he puts
this on another piece of this material. And the
leader rolls it all up and puts it in the top drawer
too. Then they take a couple of strands of my hair,
and they pull it out, and he gives this to the leader,
and he wraps that up and puts that in the top
drawer . . . And then he feels my neck, behind my
ears, under my chin, around my collar bone, and
—oh—and then they take off my shoes and look
at my feet and at my hands . . . And he takes
something, and he goes underneath my finger-
nail, and then he . . . cut off a piece of my finger-
nail, and then the doctor, the examiner, tells me
to take off my dress . . . and so I slip my dress off
. . . I lie down on the table, on my back, and he
brings over this—oh, how can I describe? They're
like needles, a whole cluster of needles, and each
needle is a wire going from it . . . They touch me
with the needles, . . . It doesn't hurt at all . . . He
puts it on my knee, and my leg jumps. And then

. . . then they said that was the end of the testing.
And the leader helped me up . . . I put my dress
on. And I was going to zip it up, and he took hold
of the zipper and zipped it up. And then—oh, I
said: I can go now? I can go back to the car? And
he said: Barney isn't ready yet . . . He said that
they were doing a few more tests with him, but
he'd be right along in a minute . . . I started talk-
ing with the leader. And I said to him that this
had been quite an experience . . . That no one
would ever, ever believe me . . . And that what I

thing about the universe. And I told him, no, I
know practically nothing . . . And he went across
the room and pulled out a map, and he asks me
had I ever seen a map like this before . . . There
were all these dots on it, scattered all over it. Some
were little, just pinpoints. And others were as
big as a nickel. And there were lines . . . going
from one dot to another. And there was one big
circle, and it had a lot of lines coming out from
it. A lot of lines going to another circle quite
close, but not as big. And these were heavy lines.

Here is the text from the document:

me over on my back, and the examiner had a long needle in his hand.... And I ask him what he's going to do with it.... and he said he just wants to put it in my nerve, it's just a simple test. And I fell him, no, it will hurt, don't do it, don't. And I'm crying, and I'm telling him: It's hurting, it's hurting, take it out, take it out! And the leader comes over, and he puts his hand, rubs his hand in front of my eyes, and he says it will be all right, I won't feel it.... The pain goes away. But I'm sore from where they put that needle.

DOCTOR: Did they make any sexual advances to you?

BETTY: No... I asked the leader, I said, Why did they put that needle into my nerve? And he said it was a pregnancy test. I said I don't know what they expected, but that was no pregnancy test. And he didn't say any more...

DOCTOR: All right. Well stop here now.

The Hills returned to the office for Betty's second session on March 14, 1964.

DOCTOR: About this needle. How far in did he inject the needle?

BETTY: Oh, it was a long needle. I don't know, I thought it—I didn't look, but I would say the needle was four inches long, or maybe... Something like a tube was attached to it. They didn't leave it in very long. Just for a second.

DOCTOR: What kind of pain was it?

BETTY: All I could think of was a knife.... Then, I was grateful to the leader for stopping the pain.

me something to take back with me, then people would believe it. And so he told me to look around—and maybe I could find something I would like to take. And I did—and there wasn't much around—but on the chair, there was a book, a fairly big book.... and I said: Could I have this? And he told me to look in the book, and I did. It had pages, it had writing, but nothing like I had ever seen before.... The writing didn't go across, it went up and down.

DOCTOR: Did it look like any language that you know or was it in English?

BETTY: No, it wasn't in English.

DOCTOR: What language do you know that goes up and down?

BETTY: I don't know, but I can recognize it. I can't read it: Japanese.

DOCTOR: Japanese. Did this look like Japanese?

BETTY: No.

DOCTOR: Was it writing or printing?

BETTY: It was different.... it had sharp lines, and they were, some were very thin, and some were medium, and some were very heavy. It had some dots. It had straight lines and curved lines. And the leader laughed, and he said me if I thought I could read it. And I told him no.... but this was going to be my proof for this happened.... And so he said that I could have it.... And I was delighted.... And so then I said... I know he wasn't from the earth, and I wanted to know where he did come from. And he asked me if I knew any-

thing about his people. And I said no. And he said: Where are you on the map? I looked and laughed and said I don't know. So he said: If you don't know where you are, then there isn't any point of my telling where I am from. And he put me away.... And I thought: Well, I still have the book.... All of a sudden, some men came in with the examiner. They are quite excited.... The examiner has me open my mouth, and he starts checking my teeth. And he tugs at them. I asked what they are trying to do.

The examiner says they could not figure it out—Barney's teeth came out and mine didn't. I was really laughing and said Barney had dentures, and I didn't. They asked me: What are dentures? And I said people as they got older lost their teeth. They go to a dentist and get dentures. Or a person sometimes—Barney had dentures because he had a mouth injury. He had to have his teeth extracted.... I said it happens to almost everyone as they get older. And he said: What is older? I said: Old age. So he said: What is old age? And I said—well it varied, but as a person gets older, there are changes in him, particularly physical. He begins to sort of break down with age. So he said, what do I mean by age? And I said the life span—the length of time people live. He said, how long was this? And I said, well, about 100 years at the most. People can die before that—most of them do.... I think the average length of time.... I don't know.... was 65 or 70. So he said, 65 or 70 what? I said: Years. He said: What is a year? And I said I had no idea how many days, and the days had so many hours,

The document appears to be an Adiabatic Chart from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau. The page is filled with complex tables, grids, and numerical data. Much of the text is difficult to read due to the image quality, but some key headers and sections are visible:

At the top right: "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, WEATHER BUREAU, ADIABATIC CHART"

There are multiple columns of numerical data and grid lines covering most of the page. The left side contains a grid with numerous rows and columns of numbers, while the right side has several sections with instructions and additional data fields.

Some sections are labeled, but due to the poor image quality, most specific text is illegible. The document appears to be a technical meteorological or scientific chart with complex data representation.

The image appears to be a grid or chart with vertical and horizontal lines. The grid has numerical markings on the left side ranging from 10 to 125, and horizontal lines at regular intervals. There are various markings and lines drawn across the grid, creating a complex pattern. The document looks like a technical or scientific chart, possibly related to data tracking or analysis. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some edge artifacts visible.

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with numerous lines and markings. However, the text on the grid is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. There are some faint markings and numbers visible along the vertical and horizontal axes, but I cannot confidently read or transcribe them. The document seems to be a technical or scientific chart of some kind, with precise gridlines and data points.
