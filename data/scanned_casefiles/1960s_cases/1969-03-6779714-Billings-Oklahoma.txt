SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
TO: DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
ATIC, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

1. At approximately 2030 hours on 6 March 1969, Capt William J. Baumhoff, a U.S. Air Force Pilot assigned to a unit at Carswell AFB, Texas, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) while en route from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma to Carswell AFB, Texas.

2. Capt Baumhoff stated that the UFO was first sighted at about 25 miles north of Billings, Oklahoma, and that it appeared to be an extremely bright light, approximately the size of a large aircraft running light, which was moving in a southerly direction at a very high rate of speed. Capt Baumhoff stated that the object remained in sight for approximately 30 seconds, during which time it made a slight course change to the southeast, and then disappeared from sight.

3. Capt Baumhoff stated that the object was not a conventional aircraft, satellite, or meteor, and that he could not determine its exact nature or identify it as a known object. He further stated that the object did not appear to have any running lights or other distinguishing features.

4. This report is submitted for your information and evaluation.

Text from the document:

"WHICH PART OF THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE WHEN FIRST SEEN? FIRST SIGHTING WAS ONLY OF THE LOWER PORTION, OR APPROXIMATELY THE BOTTOM QUARTER OF A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT. IT WAS ROTATING SLOWLY (APPROXIMATELY 5 R.P.M.) AND ASCENDING GRADUALLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS. WHEN IT DISAPPEARED, IT DID SO BY ASCENDING SMOOTHLY AND FADING FROM VIEW. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT. IT WAS A CLEAR, MOONLIGHT NIGHT, WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY.
LOCATION OF OBSERVER: BILLINGS, OKLAHOMA, APPROXIMATELY 7 MILES WEST OF THE CITY LIMITS. NO TREES OR OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: THE PORTION VISIBLE WAS A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT, WITH A DULL GRAY OR GUNMETAL COLOR. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20-30 FEET IN DIAMETER.
CONCLUSIONS: THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITE, METEOR, OR ANY OTHER KNOWN TYPE OF AERIAL VEHICLE. IT MOVED IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH ANYTHING UNDER HUMAN CONTROL. THE OBSERVER IS A MATURE, RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL WITH CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVING AIRCRAFT, AND IS COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY."

HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT HE DID NOT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON, AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. HE STATED THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT IN DETAIL BUT IT SEEMED TO BE ROUND OR OVAL IN SHAPE AND ILLUMINATED FROM WITHIN. HE SAID IT HOVERED FOR A SHORT WHILE AND THEN SUDDENLY ZOOMED AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME, AS REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER, WERE CLEAR AND STARRY. THERE WERE NO UNUSUAL NATURAL PHENOMENA GOING ON AT THE TIME, SUCH AS AURORAS, METEORS, SATELLITES, ETC. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL.

THE SUBJECT IS VERY DEFINITE IN HIS BELIEF THAT HE SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. HE STATES THAT HE HAS NEVER HAD AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THAT IT IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH HIS NORMAL WAY OF THINKING. HE SEEMS SINCERE AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE TYPE WHO WOULD MAKE UP A STORY FOR ATTENTION-GETTING PURPOSES.

Unidentified Object
To do Investigation

Air Space Law of the
Location Area - This report
deals with objects appearing in
the air over the site of the
Billings, Oklahoma "UFO" case of 22 March 1963. The object was reported to this office by
CHARLIE BILLUPS, former administrator of the Billings.
Oklahoma Vocational Technical Institute. The report was
received on 27 January 1969 and reads as follows:

The CHP related that at about 11:00 AM on 22 March 1963,
he was driving north on U.S. Highway 281 about 3 miles north
of Billings, Oklahoma. The weather was clear and visibility
was good. He stated that as he approached a slight rise in the
highway just north of town, he saw an object in the air to his
right which he described as round or disc-shaped and silver in
color. He said it appeared to be hovering and that it was
approximately 100 to 150 feet in diameter. The object was at
an estimated altitude of about 500 feet. The witness described
the object as having a metallic appearance and stated that it
remained stationary for about 3 to 5 minutes before beginning
to move slowly to the northwest. As the object moved away, it
appeared to ascend gradually. The witness stated that as it
moved away, it had a "wavering" or "fluttering" motion. He
said that as the object moved away, a vapor trail or condensation trail was visible behind it. The duration of the sighting
was approximately 10 minutes.
The CHP said he had never seen anything like it before.
He attempted to maintain visual contact with the object as long
as possible, but eventually lost sight of it due to the distance
and terrain. He said he was convinced the object was not an
aircraft, helicopter or any known type of flying vehicle. He
stated that it was definitely not a weather balloon, since the
wind was from the south at the time and the object moved in a
northwest direction.

THE UNUSUAL AND FANTASTIC ASPECT OF THE PHENOMENON OUR SENSES PERCEIVED IN THE SKY THAT MORNING WAS INDEED SO STRIKING THAT IT HAS IMPRESSED ITSELF INDELIBLY ON OUR MEMORY. IT WAS A TRULY EXTRAORDINARY APPARITION. WHAT WE SAW WAS A GIGANTIC CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT, SILVER GREY IN COLOR, HOVERING SILENTLY IN THE CLEAR BLUE SKY. IT WAS MOVING AT A FAIRLY HIGH SPEED FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, MAINTAINING A CONSTANT ALTITUDE AND COURSE. AFTER TRAVELING FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES IT SUDDENLY STOPPED, REMAINED STATIONARY FOR A FEW SECONDS, AND THEN ACCELERATED AT FANTASTIC SPEED IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

The image contains two photographs. The larger one appears to be a compass-like diagram with various cardinal directions labeled. The smaller photograph depicts a hilly landscape. Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will refrain from identifying or naming any individuals.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

PROJECT BLUESHERT INVESTIGATION 
THE SIGHTED AN was apparently at 1915, VHSN TttS 
WAS STATED TO BE S MILE NORTH OF BILLINGS, OKLAHOMA. THE OBSERVER REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT LIGHT HOVERING OVER THE HIGHWAY. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS FIRST OBSERVED IN THE NORTHWEST, WHERE IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT THEN BEGAN TO MOVE RAPIDLY TO THE EAST, SOUTH, WEST AND BACK TO THE NORTH. THE LIGHT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR AT VARIOUS INTERVALS DURING ITS MOVEMENTS. THE ENTIRE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THE LIGHT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING VERY BRIGHT AND ILLUMINATING THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE.
THE OBSERVER STATED THAT HE WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AT THE TIME HE SIGHTED THE OBJECT. WHEN HE FIRST OBSERVED IT, HE REDUCED HIS SPEED TO GET A BETTER VIEW. THE OBJECT WAS AT ABOUT 45 DEGREES ELEVATION AND SEEMED TO BE FROM 1 TO 2 MILES AWAY. NO SOUND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT.
AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES, THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED AND DID NOT REAPPEAR. THE OBSERVER STATED THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT DUE TO ITS DISTANCE.
PHENOMENOM WAS APPARENTLY DUE TO THE OBSERVER'S MOVEMENTS.
