TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

July 11, 1963.

Capt. Craig -

I am convinced as to the nature of the object 9 have seen - it appears to be a flying saucer and as flight is concerned and as bright in the moon over Ludington, Michigan. It was 4:15 A.M. July 11, 1963. I have telephoned and reported it to the U.S. Coast Guard station and they tell me they don't know what it was as it was of massive size.

I have seen objects before and called the U.S. Coast Guard station and they tell me they don't know what they were as it was of massive size. I am a plant chemist at Dow Chemical Co. at Midland, Michigan.

2 AUGUST 1963

TO: HQ USAF SAF-OI 3b (Mrs. Wells)
WASH 25 DC

1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. requesting information on unidentified flying objects. This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Direction and short duration of this sighting are not consistent with sightings of satellites or possibly an aircraft as the V-103 airway from White Cloud to Muskegon parallels the flight course of the object.

3. Additional information will be necessary if an evaluation is to be made.

Text from the document:

August 5, 1963

Dear Mr. ____,

Your letter regarding the observance of an unidentified aerial object has been forwarded to this office.

Based on information provided in your letter, the sighting appears to be consistent with observations of the V-193 airway from white cloud to dusk. The altitude, path, and duration of this sighting are not consistent with credible observations.

Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

MASTON H. SACKS
