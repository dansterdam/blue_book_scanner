July, 11, 1963:

Chief Capt:

I am curious as to what I have seen. If may be none of my business, but I have seen it there.

It looks like a star and, as bright as one. Travels from south to north over Ludington Michigan.

The time was 4:15 PM July 11, 1963. It has terrific speed. I watched it for about 2 min. then it was out of sight. What was it?

I have seen objects before and called the U.S. Coast Guard station and they told me they didn't know what they were as Radar at Muskegon would not track the object.

I am a plant guard at the Dow Chemical Co. Lud. Michigan.

Thank You.

Ludington, Michigan.
