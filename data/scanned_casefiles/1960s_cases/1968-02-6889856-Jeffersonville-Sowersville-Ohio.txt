Observers sighted an object that flashed flickered and changed colors from white, green, red, and blue. One observer stated that the object resembled a balloon rising and falling with air flow. The object was seen roughly in the SW.

COMMENTS: The report is by two independent witnesses. One said that the object disappeared at 0235, the other stated that the object disappeared at 0500. There were several bright stars in the area.

At 0200, bright point of 27 deg. elevation, about 6 deg. northwest, azimuth of 335 deg. elevation of about 25 deg. SIRIUS. At about 4 deg. At about 0230 Sirius was at an azimuth of 251 deg. At about 0300 Betelgeuse was at an elevation of 265 deg. azimuth of 265 deg.
