Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and heavy noise/graininess. The document appears to be a scanned black and white page with significant degradation that makes reading the text impossible.

Photo #6 - Elevated shot at night of the area.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality and heavy distortion of the scanned document. The image appears to be a heavily degraded black and white document page with significant noise, smudging, and blurring that makes reading any text impossible.

Photo #3 - Moments later, walked toward the area of noise and took this picture.


- page 6 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a landscape with tall grass or reeds in the foreground and trees or bushes in the background. The image has a grainy, high-contrast appearance typical of older photographic prints.

1, 2 and 3 were taken.

I apologize, but I cannot discern any legible text in this image. The document appears to be a very low-quality, grainy black and white photograph or scan that is heavily distorted and difficult to read. The image looks like it might be of a landscape or forest scene, but the details are obscured by heavy noise and degradation.

Photo #5 - Close up of area where sighting occurred. Fence same as in Picture #4.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a landscape with trees and a fence in the foreground, showing a wooded area with coniferous trees against a lighter background.

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF                                      IR                              QUALITY    Fair
P NRS      7 polaroid prints (B&W)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request submitted by Major Quintanilla (DTER) to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the seven submitted polaroid-type prints has negated double exposure and/or rerouting; the photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. The object, which appears only on photos one and two, was photographed at night using a flash attachment. The camera focal length was apparently set for close range as is evidenced by the relatively high degree of detail in the foreground. Source indicated that the object was circular with a domed top and flat bottom having a diameter of 20 to 25 feet. The object photographed has the appearance of a "horseshoed" or "squashed" cylinder and exhibits a fairly high degree of detail and reflectivity as is indicated by the retention of the flash attachment. By computing the camera focal length versus the size of the object as it appears in the photography, it would have to be positioned at least 300 feet from the camera lens. At this distance the flash attachment would not illuminate the object. The object appears to be located on the ground and immediately beyond the perimeter of light from the flash attachment. The exact size of the object is not known but its apparent distance from the camera lens indicates the diameter is likely to be between 1 and 2 feet.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a landscape with trees or tall grass, with varying shades of gray and black creating a grainy, textured effect. The bottom of the image shows lighter, more dense vegetation or grass, while the upper portion is darker with some vertical lines suggesting tree trunks or branches.

MAY 1 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Reference your recent unidentified flying object report. Photo analysis of the submitted photograph revealed the following:

This object which appears only on photos one and two, was photographed at night using a flash attachment. The camera focal length was apparently set for close range as is evidenced by the relatively high degree of detail. In the foreground, source indicated that the object was circular with a domed top and flat bottom turning at diameter of 20 to 25 feet. The object photographed has the appearance of a "crushed" or "squashed" cylinder and exhibited a fairly high degree of detail. The relativity as is indicated by the reflection of the flash attachment. By computing the camera focal length versus the size of the object as it appeared in the photograph, it would have to be positioned at least 300 feet from the camera lens. At this distance the flash attachment would not illuminate the object. Some 20 to 25 feet beyond the ground and immediately beyond the perimeter of light emitted by the flash attachment. The area of the object is not known but its apparent distance from the camera lens indicates the diameter is likely to be between 20 and 25 feet.

The photographs do not support the submitted description of the object. The object observed, if any, was not photographed.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Your file negative are included.
