OCR Text:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON. IT SEEMED TO FLICKER OFF SLOWLY ON EACH END, THEN JUST RAPIDLY AND SLIPPED OUT OF SIGHT.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: 
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE
b. Color: CHANGING FROM RED TO ORANGE TO A VERY PALE YELLOWISH WHITE AS IT ROTATED.
18. We want to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the match stick's length is contained in the known object. We need this experiment at the time of the sighting. THIS SEEMED VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AS IT WAS A COMPLEX ROTATING FORM, NOT A SIMPLE SHAPE AT ALL. IT CAME FROM SOME DISTANCE AND THE ANGULAR SIZE SEEMED TO START FAIRLY LARGE AND GROW SMALLER AS IT MOVED FARTHER AWAY.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. I COULD TELL THE MOTION WAS LIGHTS.

There is no photograph present in this document page. The image appears to be a diagram showing an illustration of an object's path and the use of a compass to describe its movement.

The OCR output of the text on the document page is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°
       75°
           60°
                45°
                     30°
                          15°
                               0°-5°
MW HORIZON

28. Trace the path of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

"A"_______                        "B"_______

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Beginning OCR:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 MAR 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or narrative explanation of your sighting:

This only reason we noticed it, to my wife turned to me and said, "look" at the lights and she said down before by the neighbor's daughter, we had been watching for an hour and we were going to go visiting and any time anyone came went, we saw two very bright round lights in the northwest and they moved up and down and changed color to blueish green, and they disappeared for long periods of time and we failed to see them again for that night. The next morning we found another neighbor woman had seen the lights about a half an hour after we saw them and we have since found that several families in the area saw the lights, but what they were, we have not the least idea. We were hoping you might be able to tell us what they were. It must have been something, but we called the Sheriff's office and they did not know anything about it. A sighted Plane can be apparently an airplane, but this type did not come close enough for us to identify it as such. We have no other explanation to offer except that is how we saw them.
