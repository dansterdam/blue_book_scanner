35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The only reason we noticed it, is my wife turned off the kitchen light after finishing washing dinner dishes, and she looked out the West window of the darkened kitchen to see if the neighbors house had light. If they did, we were going to go visiting. Their place is 3/4 mile away. And it was moonlight enough out, so we could see their house buildings outlined. We could see how it was placed compared to their buildings' settings. We then called the Sheriff's office to have him radio Associated Press more else to look. Apparently we just got out in the first place. We weren't going to tell anyone. The first thing we knew, the local T.V. my 2 1/2 year old daughter must have seen it, because she said "Star all gone". Disappeared she said.
