TRAFFIC OR BALLON RELEASES IN AREA THAT MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR
THIS SIGHTING. K. REPORTING OFFICER: ASST. OIC, COMBAT
INTELLIGENCE BRANCH, WALKER AFB, NEW MEXICO. COMMENTS:

COMMENTS OF OBSERVERS INTERVIEWED INDICATES CONSISTENCY OF
REPORTING THIS ISOLATED SIGHTING. WEATHER PHENOMENA CANNOT
BE FULLY DISCOUNTED, HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE LONG DURATION
AND EVEN PATTERN OF THE DESCENT OF THIS OBJECT DOWN TO THE
HORIZON RELATES IT MORE CLOSELY TO IT BEING ANOTHER CELESTIAL
BODY. LASTLY, THE IDEA OF IT BEING A CELESTIAL BODY IS
LARGELY DISCOUNTED BY THE REPORTE PERSISTENT RED-GREEN-
YELLOW COLORATION. FUTHER OBSERVATION IS RECOMMENDED.

L. NO PHOTOGRAPHS OR ADDITIONAL MATERIAL CC AVAILABLE IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS SIGHTING.
