Analysis and Conclusions: The observations of the objects by the witnesses are possibly explained by refracted light from bright planets and other astronomical objects which coincide with the witnesses. It appears that the cause of this sighting was a combination of astronomical observation of bright objects. Due to it reflecting as "stars", the probable astronomical reflection.

"Ballute" Test
Successful
Balloon To Be Used
On Space Capsules
A rubber-coated fabric balloon was launched successfully in a Wright Air Development division (WADD) test yesterday over the Eglin Gulf test range in Florida.

Scientists forecast using the balloon, nicknamed "Ballute", to cover space capsules, retard their tumbling and control their speed.

Nine-feet in diameter, the balloon was developed by Goodyear Aircraft company of Akron.

"Ballute" blossomed forth when initiated at an altitude of 150,000 feet—its zenith—and at a speed of more than 15 times the speed of sound.

A second firing of the balloon yesterday a boating mechanism was a success and two Micas. A third firing is expected to accelerate the test program to determine the balloon's sound and boost the weight to 200 feet, during the next life.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of April 17 addressed to a Lt Colonel Nichols concerning unidentified flying objects has been referred to this office.

In your letter you direct our attention to a sighting which occurred that the observer saw a white type, anti-collision beacon used as a civil airborne. This light is of strobe intensity and rotated at the speed mentioned in your letter. Due to the range visibility are bent and filtered, thereby creating color type light waves red being the longest and strongest. Atmospheric light with account further for the disarrangement of the atmospheric would demonstrate of this phenomena can be seen when the (Venus near the horizon prior to its "setting") Also the planet Jupiter, and Venus as well, can be seen to reverberate from a position will also appear in several variety colors in they mean the horizon a relatively dense atmosphere of about or slant range filtration through.

A recent flurry of "flying saucer" reports from the Florida coast in the vicinity of Fort Pierce, Florida, produced the same type of Atlantic Missile Range Radars and also a visual. The target on our a B-57 jet aircraft to investigate. The pilot of the aircraft "scrambled" with powerful binoculars and when within fifty miles of the aircraft had a "glowing" with outstanding light which changed color at times," he looked more reports came in from ground observers. A few minutes later, pilot of the B-57 vectored toward the target (some description). When some type of light. This was Delta DC-8 flight 962 inbound for Miami International Airport.

A check with the Director of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago revealed that they are not compiling data on UFO sightings.

As a matter of fact, the Planetarium stipulated they knew nothing about such sighting.

Mr. Per previous letters to you, I am enclosing the latest news release on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

You must realize that we do not have the personnel or the time to accumulate the incremental data of opening up the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's UFO files to all those who ask. However, we do permit bona fide non-scientific requests to these files when they so request - as many have done.

I would like to obtain our government's good cooperation concerning the subject of unidentified flying objects or U.F.O.'s.

Details of a interesting sighting that happened over
sunday of that week at D. G. Gingwill, State Fair at
nite. The wife was also here, wrote for week: "That was
just flying object which does not appear to be an
artificial satellite now observed by a clay ton amateur
astronomer, he reported a Tuesday.

Paul Noth
saw near the D. G. Gingwill, State Fair. It was 9:3
P.M. on Wednesday that he saw the object with
a run of powerful binoculars, at an angle of about 6
degrees, traveling south-southeast to north-north-
east. He followed it for about three minutes. "It was re-
markable with the sense that it shed a light white to
faint white glow, and when the light was off, the
object glow or dark seemed about times the same."

It is possible that the cause of this sighting was a misinterpretation of equal brightness of celestial objects. Therefore it will be reflected as "space" or due to atmospheric refraction.
