11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Obj appeared to travel at a fast rate of speed, and was
accompanied by a red and white light. It could not have been
an airplane or helicopter because of the absolute absence of
sound, so said the witness. It appeared to travel horizontally
for a while, then change direction at a right angle and
start dropping vertically until it disappeared in mid air.
Information in letter quite sketchy, therefore, forms sent.

Subject:

The present is to notify you of the appearance of a strange object in the sky of Gainesville, Fla. (Alachua County) at about 11:00 p.m. Saturday April 2. This occurrence was witnessed by at least three people, whose names are given below. This object appeared to travel at a fast rate of speed, and was accompanied by red and white light. It could not have been an airplane or helicopter because of the absolute silence of sound.

It appeared to move mechanically. For a while, it changed direction at what might be described as hovering vertically in its direction in mid-air.
