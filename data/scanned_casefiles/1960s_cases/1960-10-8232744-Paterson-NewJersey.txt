Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Date at top appears to be 19/19/61, though this seems to be an error]

Dear Sir:

[The rest of the text is partially legible, with some words and phrases discernible but not fully clear. The document appears to be a typed or handwritten letter with a list of numbered items or observations. Some words that can be made out include:

- "shape"
- "color"
- "duration"
- "movement"

The bottom of the document contains a few more numbered points, but the text is difficult to read completely.]

The document seems to be related to some kind of observation or report, possibly a UFO sighting, but without a complete clear reading, I cannot definitively state its full contents.
