Dear Sirs:

On the night of Friday, July 8th, 1960 while playing ball out-
side of the "Washborne Memorial Pool" in Hawthorn, at approxi-
mately 9:30 P.M. I looked up and saw a blob of white light about the
size of a quarter traveling across the sky to the approx-
imate northwest. This was took to a height of approximately one
sixth of a degree, and traveled across approximately 5-7 seconds after the first
sighted. It appeared stationary at altitude at which it was fl-ing
at approximately 25,000 ft. using a circus cloud as a
guide.

We would like to know if there were any military
or commercial planes flying over this area at 8:13 P.M.
July 8th, 1960.

Would appreciate it if you would reply with the
necessary information.

Thank you,
Hawthorne, N.J.
