The image appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text indicates that a person named Major Quintanilla called someone named Mrs. [redacted] after seeing a flash while driving down the highway. It seems that Major Quintanilla took a picture, but only has the negatives at this time. The text mentions that the negatives show a "cloud of smoke" going in a certain direction, and Mrs. [redacted] said she would be glad to send the negatives or prints of the negatives.

On the afternoon of December 9th, a mysterious firefall made its way across several states and Canada, and was sighted by airline pilots as well as by hundreds or thousands of other people. Strange metal strips were found in a swamp 40 miles northwest of Bristow, Oklahoma, about 30 miles from Pittsburg, Pa. It was sealed off for several hours - while a thorough search and hundreds of interviews of people were conducted.
The object made a tremendous noise and light as it passed, and was observed in several states. It is indicated that a meteorite was probably the cause of it all, but the times involved indicate that the object was traveling much too slow for a meteorite. There have been several references to such a firefall in the past, and the object has been compared to a "green fireball" seen in other parts of the country.

Dear Major Quintanilla:
On December 9, shortly before 5 p.m., a bright light was observed in the sky. The light was traveling in a northwest direction and was observed for about 90 degrees of travel before disappearing. Directly with the flash traveled to the east and was estimated about 100 degrees away and declined at about 30 degrees elevation. The duration of the entire observation was approximately 3 to 4 seconds. From the time it was first observed, it appeared to be diminishing in intensity and ended abruptly.

The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from a Project Blue Book report. There is no photograph present in this image. 

The text in the document is as follows:

"Dear Captain, Attached is my copy of the incident report and made four photographs of the object. The object remained visible for a 122 millisecond time or fifteen seconds. The object was taken approximately 45 second after my initial observation. The sound disappeared after my first observation for 5-5 seconds, the object at a minute and ten seconds, and then lasted for a minute and 20 seconds. The photographs made are un-retouched and unaltered, from the four by five inch negatives, of the object."

Gentleman,

I have just returned from a second trip to Mount Beach and I am happy to report on the event.

Since I sighted that thing over County I suppose you are the people to whom I should report.

At approx 10:15 pm and for about 15 mins starting through the window to watch a circular object like an ilumanated window hovering over the city of Pittsburgh when we were looking out the window to watch it.

A swift lit shaped object also seemed to be flying manuvered for a split second then going into a 70 climb with an orange flames. Then appearing behind it. It was a matter of 3 to 4 seconds it was gone just like a rocket taking off the ground. 

That was the event I wanted to report than ever before more news.

I was not drinking and have flown quite a bit as a passenger and am a former R.C.A.F. pilot from the last war. I have never seen anything like it before. It appear ed to be stationary the speed & change in direction and terrific speed.

I hope that this information may be of use.

Dear Dr. [redacted],

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter regarding your unidentified object observation. A heavy backlog of correspondence and reports has prevented our answering all inquiries as promptly as we should like.

The object which you observed, south of Pittsburgh, on the evening of December 9, 1965, was definitely a brilliant celestial body. This same object was reported to the Air Force by numerous observers in Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

Your interest in our program is appreciated. Thank you for reporting your sighting to us.

The text in the document is as follows:

Great Lakes Fireball

The truth of the re-entry of a fireball on the evening of December 9, 1965 in the Great Lakes area has been determined. The fireball was apparently a meteor or possible meteoritic mass. An observer close to the scene was Von Shelton Herschel of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who saw the fireball at 5:18 p.m. EST and estimated its duration at 3-4 seconds. The fireball was seen over a wide area and reported by some 100 persons sent him reports. It was apparently visible as far east as Toronto, Canada, and west to south central Iowa.

The fireball's path through the atmosphere was from northwest to southeast, passing over southern Michigan, northern Indiana, and northern Ohio. The explosion which occurred near the southeastern shore of Lake Erie was apparently audible within a radius of 100-125 miles. Many observers thought the noise was a sonic boom from an aircraft. The fireball apparently broke up near the earth's surface, though the exact altitude is not known. No fragments have been recovered.

The path of the fireball extended roughly from Lansing, Michigan, through Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and ending in the area of Sandusky, Ohio. The duration of the fireball was approximately 3-4 seconds, and the distance traveled was around 200 miles.

FATE on the afternoon of December 9, 1965 a fireball that must have been visible from a wide area occurred over the Great Lakes states. Though there was considerable publicity about the event at the time, little has been heard of it since. The fireball was apparently a meteor or possible meteoritic mass.

GREAT LAKES FIREBALL
A statement from page 79.
When I watched the object it seemed to be much closer than it really was. When I first noticed it I had started to drive off while looking back, and as I was looking back the object seemed to be very close over the trees.
If the meteorite had fallen a few miles west it would have been in sight at least one minute, as it traveled across the sky with the short visibility of the bright illumination that it was only carried east.
William Werner, a regional director of the Civilian Saucer Intelligence Corps, stated that Duell of Wooster, Ohio, who directed the search at the time, reported the object to be visible briefly for about one minute, then it disappeared with no sound.
It was reported that after about five minutes, the object reappeared and was visible for about another five minutes, traveling off-white in color, ending as "a thin line" until at least 50 to 60 percent of the object had disappeared.

Detroio. The crew had sighted an object
over 1 Illinois, at 8 p.m. on the 3rd. Steverai other radio messages were received from
allege. Sightings in Michigan, Canada,
and Ohio. The object which was first reported over
Lake Erie. When all the sightings were plotted on a map they
formed a line from the Great Lakes to the
Atlantic Ocean. This was explained as "probable" because a launching from an on
and Pete's island (see map). This agreed
with sightings from the 30 central area.

Port Clinton, Ohio. Although these sightings
were secondary, the locals were excited by thc
phenomenon, probably because it was
first in it. It was thought to be the same
as the 8 p.m. sighting over Lake Erie.

3. Port Clinton--on the south shore of
Lake Erie, Michigan. The fireball seemed to the
observers to be much smaller than the reports
past the fireball occurred south of the lake.
Bast the fireball occurred north of the laker
and the observers were convinced that it was
something it anyone had seen the fireball. No
one had, but many reports were received a few
minutes later of a fireball seen across the lake
from the east or northwest. This sounds
familiar and may have been the same
phenomena.

4. view of the small population of
the mid and Erie. the Island coast. This
land view shows the limited visibility at
the time. Only the tops of trees and a few buildings
can be seen inside as much as possible in December. It is not surprising that there were
fewer reports.

Calling Goschen: Gosben, on the
opposite shore of the lake, it failed to
give any definite reports. It is clear from
the accounts that the fireball appeared
about 30 seconds after it disappeared, they
heard a loud noise, but saw nothing.

Channing, who took the accompanying
photograph, did not arrive on the scene
until some time after the fireball had
disappeared.

It is clear that only one fireball cc-
curred and thatat least two communities
misinterpreted the data and reported two
separate events. There are several pages at the end of
this transcript.

This report, all was observed by many
people in Osisko, Ashtabula, Ohio about
40 minutes and 15 minutes respectively southwest and to the northeast. It was also
reported, both in southwestern Pennsylvania
and in northeastern Ohio. Everyone who
observed this phenomenon thought it was
unique.

There are several happenings associated
from the impressions of everyone the
fireball,, but almost everyone who saw the fire
ball agreed that it was "quite amazing."

At 2300 hrs AFIX Command Post called and advised me that May Brown, Rahall Air Defense Sector, AO 2816, Ex 741, called and reported seeing nine objects described as round, glowing reddish orange, larger than a dime in size, traveling in a diagonal and parallel direction from Ohio Indiana Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
The time of sighting was 4:35 PM.
Some reports stated that the object was large and cigarshape 

A call was received from Mr. [redacted], Dayton, Michigan reporting something he watched for a while longer than he was accustomed to observing in the sky. He was advised to report this through military channels as this may involve something that needs further investigation and pick-up on his object that started a fire.

They obtained the atmosphere condition from Ostreal radio wanting to swap information. They told me this had reports of these objects but they did not know what they were. I told them that I have no more they had no more information to give me what I had.

I would appreciate, 800 55-2, ext 6794 I could call and I am to call them if I get any word. Quintanilla is to see them during the duty day.

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI0C (Mrs Hunt)

1. Mr Kenneth A Parks, Lapser County Sheriff, has requested information regarding the identity of some material which he submitted to PFIR.

The following paragraph is provided to assist you with your request:

2. The "fireball" which was sighted by Lapser County residents was also observed by residents in Indiana, Ohio, Southeastern Michigan, and Pennsylvania. There is no connection between the fireball and the material found in Lapser County. The material submitted originated as some type of paper, metallic, and plastic fragments which were dropped by aircraft as a result of the fireball. This was to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises. There was gravel for many miles, depending on wind currents and wind velocities.

Major Howard from the Pentagon called. He wanted to find some information as to what he could release as a statement to the public concerning the meteor over Asme, Pennsylvania. Major told him that a team of men were sent out from the Oakdale Radar Site in Oakdale, Pennsylvania. They searched until 2 o'clock, and were unsuccessful in finding the object. This thing was visual, was not picked up by radar. Major told Major Howard that reports came from northern Pennsylvania, Southern Michigan, Northern Ohio, and parts of Indiana. The team of men who were sent out to pick up the object worked along with the State Highway Patrol in trying to recover the object. He explained the Major Howard that the thing could be a meteor or a balloon. He explained that a hollide is a meteor with sound. This thing could travel 2¼ miles per second. Major Quintanilla said that it was OK to call it a meteor that entered the atmosphere. He said that investigation is still under way. There was no space debris which entered the atmosphere on 9 December 1965.
