THIS OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT APPROXIMATELY 0900 HOURS ON 8 NOV 60. IT WAS OVAL SHAPED, SILVER IN COLOR AND VERY BRIGHT. IT APPEARED TO BE ROTATING SLOWLY. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. IT THEN INCREASED IN SPEED AND DISAPPEARED TO THE SOUTH. AT NO TIME WAS THE OBJECT BELOW THE CLOUD COVER. THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY UNUSUAL PHENOMENON. OBSERVERS FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUESTED.

The text from the newspaper clipping is as follows:

S.D. SKIES GLOW
PILOTS SPOT MYSTERY LIGHT
By JOHN PAINTER
Two Navy pilots reported seeing an unusual glowing light in the sky over San Diego last night, the Air Force radar station at Miramar said.
The pilots, on a routine training flight, said they spotted the glowing light at 7:42 P.M. Lt. Jn. Jacobs of North Island said the light appeared to be about 7,000 to 8,000 feet in the air and was stationary. 
The Air Force radar station at Miramar said the light could not be picked up on its equipment.
"The light appeared to be a steady glow, not blinking as a satellite would. We then set our instruments to see if we could track it, but it was not picked up by our equipment," a spokesman said.
Lt. Jn. Jacobs said the light appeared to be a "steady, intensely bright light" which he said was seen for about two minutes. As he flew closer to investigate, he said the light faded and disappeared.
The Air Force said it was unable to determine the source of the mysterious light.

My husband put a report in. You a report on our siting, but I did not have the report. I did not have the report so you will be getting it from the enclosed with the date given above is correct.

We did not receive any acknowledgement from Air Force Investigative personnel regarding this incident. I would appreciate it if you would send any information pertaining to this sighting as it is of interest to us.

Very truly yours,

"January 27, 1961

Capt. Lawrence Trucker
I. D. No. V. -General 13
Palywonda, 23, California

Dear Sir:

I would like to report a very strange sighting in the sky over Chula Vista and San Diego over a month ago.

On the evening of December 23, 1960, my wife and I were out for a drive around 8:30 p.m. As we were driving along Broadway in Chula Vista, an extremely bright object came into view, moving at a very high rate of speed.

At first I thought it was possibly an airplane, but it was traveling much too fast. We watched it for about 30 to 45 seconds, and it was moving in a straight line. As it passed overhead, it appeared to be 3 to 4 times the size of a normal aircraft.

The object had a bright white light, and seemed to be glowing or emitting its own light. It made no sound at all, and left no trail or exhaust behind it.

After it passed overhead, it seemed to suddenly disappear from view. We were both amazed at what we had seen, and discussed it for some time afterwards.

On the evening of January 7, 1961, my wife and I were again driving in the same area around 8:30 p.m. Suddenly, the same or a very similar object came into view, moving at the same high rate of speed. It was in sight for about 15 to 20 seconds before it disappeared from view.

If I were to identify this object, I would have to say it was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen before. It was much larger, faster, and completely silent in its operation.

There was no indication that this object was controlled by any normal propulsion system. It seemed to be navigating under its own power, and was able to change direction and speed with ease.

I would appreciate it if you could give me any information or explanation as to what this object might have been. I realize that it is difficult to identify a sighting like this, but I feel it is important to report it, as I am convinced that it was not a normal aircraft.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Lawrence Tucker"

Page Two
I felt it is about a report to be seen as a sighting to be considered to have been an unusual phenomena occured. They stated that they reported the saw a strange object in the sky which they were unable to identify. What they said that they estimate its size as approximately about 35 to 40 feet in diameter and the object 15 to 20 feet over the ground and perhaps a triangle to triangulate. 
If some of the visual Air Force scientists could not explain this sighting then it seems to be very strange aircraft. If so, it should be reported to their Air Force personnel. Possibly, the thing seems to be floating in the air with no apparent source of propulsion. And one of the main points would be the last one to inprect that he could not how he tell them about. 
I would not a little more detailed if we will be appreciate any clarification you may have on this incident. Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
