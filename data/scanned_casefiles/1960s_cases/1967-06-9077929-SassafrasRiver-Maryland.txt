11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noticed flashing lights traveling in a southerly direction over the Sassafras River. There were 20 to 30 flashes in a big gap pattern. The first flash was near Point no point. It was a brief light. The object diminished somewhat, and simply stopped about 1/2 mile from the point. The flashes seemed to alternate at intervals but the distance intervals varied somewhat.

Conduct with Bendix Field operations revealed that G-A/124 aircraft was in the area at the time of the sighting, and the motion of the object was consistent with the motion of the aircraft.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your recent correspondence concerning your unusual Observation, the description you submitted was similar to that of an aircraft. We contacted the Bendix Flight Operations at Goddard Space Flight Center, and in the past, these aircraft have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings.

Between 10:00 p.m., June 17, and 1:15 a.m., June 18, a C-118A NASA aircraft was in the area of the reported sighting at approximately 10:30 p.m., June 17. The tests were conducted at varying altitudes, displaying a 450-watt tracking light located on the bottom of the aircraft.

Although we cannot identify your observation positively, we do believe this aircraft to have been responsible for your sighting.

I think I should tell you how this came about. I was walking home from the shopping center, when I look normally and saw a jet, as first I thought it was a jet that flew over. After looking (at) it while it was a UFO. I told my brother to look. We saw it move then he lost it. I started to run to the house when it went behind a tree. I wanted to see if it was still there, so I ran in the backyard, but I was back there I could see it anymore.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] July 24, 1957 (Sighting 4 Jun 67)

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent letter in which you requested information on unidentified flying objects.

With the information which you submitted in your letter, it would be extremely difficult to offer an explanation on your observation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation.

Also, it is not possible for us to undertake an investigation into the cause of your observation, since your sighting occurred outside the limits of the United States.

The enclosed information on the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects should be of interest to you.

Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention. We hope that your visit to the United States is pleasant.

Dear Sir,

9 am an Irish student working in the United States for the summer. 9 am extremely interested in UFO's, and 9 believe that your response contain articles and booklets to the general public. Of this is so perhaps you could send me the material available. After July 29 my address will be:

Litchfield, Conn.

9 am seriously interested in the UFO mystery, and have read books and articles by Hynek, Vallee, Mengel, Ruppelt, Adams, and other authors. 9 have seen one UFO. It looked like a pencil-shaped cloud ( about the size of a horse) held at arm's length. Long region sky (it covered almost half the sky) (45 - 25 degrees horizon) in about 10-15 seconds. It was cloud-like, moved, and completely silent. It moved due east of my sighting occurred in northeast. 9 am helping to write a more complete report. Hoping 9 can help you too much trouble, 9 remain,

Dear

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Sirs,

I would like to report a UFO Sighting. It happened in June of '67, but I have been rather reluctant to report it. It was going out at about 7:00.

I was a refractor, a three inch. Just as I was going out I noticed a bright object passing from east to west very fast. It was only in view for about three seconds.

It was about the size of an egg at arms length, the shape was oblong, it was white with a blue haze around it. It could have been a meteor or comet. I would like to know if there were any comets in the Durango area at the time.

I am twelve years old. I have read about them many times, and I know I didn't see swamp gas, or a hallucination, or satellite.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] 15 June 1967 (sighting 7 June)

Dear [redacted]

Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object.

The Project Blue Book office has received no information from Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois, concerning your observation. If the base UFO Investigator is able to determine what was responsible for the sightings, then the report is not forwarded to our office. The base investigator is in a much better position to quickly investigate sightings from your area than members of the Project Blue Book office.

If the Chanute AFB investigator found that an aircraft was in the immediate area making instrument landings then this could have been what you observed. Such aircraft on instrument missions have been responsible for UFO sightings in the past.

If any alien craft had been in the areas, our radar sensors and our aircraft crews would have certainly detected such an event. We have received no additional reports from your area on the date of your sighting.

Dear Sirs:

I'm printing because I have the most unreadable writing on June 7, 1967 at Holy Trinity Catholic school during 11:30 - 12:30 sighted and it caused havoc in the entire school and our class. I am a 6th grader and phoned WGPA local radio station but they gave it no concern. So some of us went and reported it to the police. The police also gave no concern. But a local newspaper, the graphic, sent over a reporter who interviewed some of us about it. When first seen at recess it was about the size of a small stone. But on the way back from the Police Station Joseph Barrett and my self saw it again in the shape and size of a football. It dropped something from its bottom and the disappear.

Gentlemen:

I would like to report a phenomenon to you, and would appreciate
it if you know of some explanation. It occurred June 17, 1967.

At about 10:30 PM EDT we were anchored in a cove just above
Marsh Point on the Sassafras River, Md. One of the two girls
in our group pointed out something in the sky with a statement
such as "Look at those flashing lights." We all looked, and all
saw a series of perhaps 20 to 30 flashes in a zig-zag pattern
covering an arc of about 45Â°, for a 20-30 second period. The
lights were in a easterly direction. Georgetown, Md. and
proceeded from about directly above towards the horizon in a
west to easterly direction. The first flashes were about as
bright as a bright star. The last flashes diminished somewhat,
and then simply stopped. The 45Â° above the horizon. The flashes
seemed to be a regular, time interval but the distance intervals
varied greatly. There was a star we could use as orientation.
I have attached a drawing. There were no colored lights, sounds,
etc. and none of us imagined it could be any type of plane, balloon,
etc.

The only thing I can imagine, unless it is a "UFO", would be some
kind of test of high altitude photography.

If you know of an explanation I would appreciate hearing from you,
otherwise we will claim that we have seen a "UFO". Naturally, I
want to check this. But because we feel sure we actually have
witnessed something that doesn't have a common technological
explanation.

Very truly yours,

June 13, 1967

Gentlemen,

I wish to inform you of an Unidentified Flying Object sighting on the night of June 13, 1967 at 11:35 P.M.

Two of my friends, [redacted text] and [redacted text] were sleeping out with me having [redacted text] back yard. I was already night and neither [redacted text] were visible.

Lying and feeling asleep, kindly doesn't want give some and were facing the opposite direction (northeast). I first saw it in the southwest and I told [redacted text] to look at the sightly but it suddenly moved faster than anything I have ever seen to the north western sky where 12 to 15 feet and lost speed, but a split second later it passed again along its path.


- page 68 -

It did then split second maneuver for
but, to second in the northwest suddenly
slowing and fading then reappearing until
it suddenly made a long run towards
the southwest wing extremely fast. In the middle
of this run it slowed and faded, then let
another long run (still outward) and disap-
peared. I would like to mention the fact that
maneuvers were very short turns except for
the one in the south. It was a bright white
color bright and slightly larger than the point
from which it was just preceding the previous
mark and had no sound.

I have the book magazine booklet on flying
saucers and I look for more information
in the book. If you wish for more information
please write to me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
