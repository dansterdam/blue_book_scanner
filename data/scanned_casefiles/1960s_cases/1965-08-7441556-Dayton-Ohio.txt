27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above his horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above his horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

Remember that there were two objects. One stood still while the other moved.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
