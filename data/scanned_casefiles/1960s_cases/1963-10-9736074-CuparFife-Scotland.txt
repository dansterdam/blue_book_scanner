Dear Sir,

On the night of October while my sister and I were out for my walk we saw something in the sky. We thought at first was aeroplane, so we could hear the sound of engines. We walked on engines but suddenly we saw the phase lights were in the sky. We kept on moving. The sight kept on moving till it ceased. Then our progress than it disappeared. I saw your advertisement in a newspaper came as I thought I might as well tell your about it.

Yours sincerely,
