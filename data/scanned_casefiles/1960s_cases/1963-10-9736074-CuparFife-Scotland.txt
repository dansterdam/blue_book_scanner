Dear Sir,
On the night of October while my son and a neighbour were out, they saw what they describe as a bright light. It was stationary for some time and then moved up and away at a tremendous speed. It was witnessed by 2 persons. If you could give me any further information on this I should be very grateful.
Yours sincerely,
[Redacted]
