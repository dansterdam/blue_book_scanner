Dear Allen:

Have your letter of 25 November regarding the October cases, and
most pleased with your continued or the Moondog evaluation.
(The first and only in the files to date).

Marilyn is off today so I am doing my own typing for a change.

Cases first: The Hillsboro, Oakwood and Atlantic cases were not
forwarded because I didn't think they were worth reproducing and we
had only one copy. However since you might want the complete
duplicate files they are attached.....

Bryefield, Mass 28 October. I called Sessions on this one and talked
with him over the phone. Note that the WX was overcast. Asked him if
anyone else had observed the object since it was in view for three
hours and other lady had called the State Police. Note that there
were no additional witnesses to the object. Although it was viewed
for this period of time. The two other Ladies mentioned (Mrs ___
the middle one) never saw the object. Her neighbor) did not
observe the object. This alone should tend to indicate the unreliability
of the report. I think this should be spent for any future contacts,
however if you feel there is anything there I'll send her a Pyre.

On the Mt Jones-Mt Shasta 30 Oct case, I can't find any reference to
reliability of the witness (unreliability). I think the witness was
regarded as reliable. The eight was no bar (3 second). And I don't
see how anything further of value could be obtained with a form. Maybe
a call would help since the question was would like an answer to the
notion of the object (it could have been stationary). The reporting
official regarded the object as a balloon, but I didn't feel that
was sufficient justification to evaluate the case as a Balloon. I did
think he was possibly correct. (Sometimes I like to think an evaluation
should be better than 50% probability before the case gets pinned).
I can send him a letter (instead of the form) asking those items which
would clarify the situation. But then this all goes back to how much effort should
we spend on cases of dubious value, at best. And how much time should we
spend to review a case from the insufficient Data case to a case where
we have sufficient information for a more firm evaluation. If the ONLY thing
we had to do were the current cases, then of course I would follow up on
a great many more than I do. Just for the sake of reducing the Insufficient
Data category and having more firm evaluations. Maybe NICAP's purpose is
to give us enough other things to do so that we can't utilize our full

eight hours on cases. And then unfortunately things in the past weren't
carried on in a manner that they are today (At least I like to think that
some progress is being made and that Major "Q" is continuing the good work
marked under Bob Frosch). You are in a better position to see what is going
on than we are here.

Major "Q" is probably going to Colorado sometime during December. I will
probably go to Washington sometime in January for compilation of the "fact
sheet". On both trips we have the better. Also it appears that you may (should)
have some PENDING cases we have the better. This release goes to our "pen-pals" and there are those who nit-pick. The more nits we
can eliminate the better. This years Socorro case will have to be included
and no doubt some comment on the release of the publication "NICAP EVIDENCE".
You are getting into the Technical how and then and as much as you would
prefer to remain free of any Air Force association you should have some say
as to what goes out to the public. The week of the 14th will be an excellent
time for you to visit Wright Pats. By then work of the data should be in.
We are working over August and hope to better than July for a batting average.
Next week TDY work on November. If we can clear next of these up we'll be
may ahead of the game. (In the past January has been reserved for the last
minute details and the fact doesn't make it until February.) When you
decide which part of the work (14th) to be here we'll make arrangements
with the Golden Bird. Try for two or three days at least. We never seem to have
enough time to cover everything.

Flashing UFO Seen
Three Hours

Mrs. Irene Page of Brimfield, Mass., reported to police on 29 October that from midnight until 3 p.m. that morning she had observed a sparkling ball of light which intermittently hovered her property. A check with State police showed no other UFO reports in that area that night.

Mrs. Page said she was checking windows and doors preparatory to retiring when light streamed through a window. She turned off the lights and watched the ball-shaped thing come over the yard and light up the entire property. She said that during the three hours the object would seem to "weave off," flying up and down like a bird. It would return periodically but finally disappeared in the distant sky at about 3 a. m.

She said she was frightened because she was alone in the house with her four children and the nearest neighbor was some distance away. She was unable to contact police during the time the object was there because she had no phone.

Mrs. Page further stated that she was watching a late show when the light came and the TV faded and returned and the house lights blinked. A nearby neighbor, Mrs. Helen Chevalier, said later
