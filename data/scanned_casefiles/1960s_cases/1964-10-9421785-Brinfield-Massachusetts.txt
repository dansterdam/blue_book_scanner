Dear Allen,

Have a letter of 25 November regarding the October sightings and (T-H-E) pleased with your concurrence of the Moondog evaluation. (The film was not submitted to NICAP since it died down to give the impression as a hoax).

As for me, I do my own typing for a change. The Hollston's Cotused and Atlantic cried were not feel worthy of a mention. They just didn't seem co me worth even mentioning and we have asked to complete a resume and sketch only fez this one. 

On the 28 October, a session was called services on this one and talked with the others who had observed the object since it was in view for three hours. At no time during the session did I feet anyone else had observed the object other than those present. The two other ladies mentioned (Airs. Moore and Mrs. Randolph) did not seem to have any definite information to add to this evaluation of the object. The two friends of the witness whom I should have contacted for any future contacts did make themselves known at the session.

On the 30 Oct, Mrs. Jones called and I confirm any reference to the station wagon which she told me she had seen a glint and a (cloud) an don't think the witless was taking about another sighting which I take a seconds) and I don't believe there was anything else she added to what I already had in my files.

The entire eval nation seems to indicate this was a very highly sophisticated object, but then this all seems to go back t0 how much effect should we spent on unidentified objects that don't seem to do anything other than exist. The rating were as efficient information for a more fine evaluation, if the ONLY thing we have efficient information for is more surveillance? Maybe we are doing too much on a case which we have very little factual information.

Data category and having some film evaluations, Maybe will/WDAPP purpose is not to give credibility or a sighting of importance to a case when in fact what we have is very little factual information for a more fine evaluation.

Text output from the document:

"This remark is made in passing, but perhaps you too have wondered about the fact that many of the "flying saucer" reports carrying on a manner that they are today (at least I like to think that sighting of unidentified objects in the past wasn't as continuous as the good people of flying saucers would have us believe). You are in a better position to see what is going on than we are.

Recently I saw a vague remark in a discussion going on in January, concerning the fact that a certain individual has mounted a concerted and comprehensive attack on the "flying saucer" theory and the USAF's stand that "there isn't anything to it". The individual (should) his name is being withheld, and the report indicated his attack was quite devastating, to the point of eliminating the better cases. This, of course, means will have to be included in any publication of the USAF or Project Blue Book report, since they want to be completely honest. We are working over against and hope to better than July for a batting average, details on those cases which didn't make it until 15 February). When you in a position to give us the dope, we will be most appreciative. We are waiting over eager and hope to better than July for a batting average, since details are the fact what (didn't make it until 15 February).  When you in a position to give us the dope, we will be most appreciative.

There appears to be no photograph or image present in this document. The document appears to be a typed report describing a sighting of a "flashing UFO" by Mrs. Irene Page of Brinfield, Massachusetts on October 9, 1964.

The report text is as follows:

Flashing UFO Seen Three Hours
Mrs. Irene Page of Brinfield, Mass. reported to State Police that from about 8:30 P.M. until about 11:45 P.M. on October 9, 1964, she had observed a sparkling ball of light which intermittently appeared and disappeared over the north country. State Police confirm her report in that area that night.
Mrs. Page said the object she saw was flashing on and off when first observed, and that when light streamed through a window, she turned off the lights and watched the object move slowly over the yard and light up the entire property. She said that during the three hours the object was visible she was unable to estimate its size and shape, but that its light at times appeared to blaze and then recede. The light would turn periodically but finally disappeared from view in the distant sky about 11:45 P.M.
Mrs. Page further stated that she was alone in the house with her four children and the nearest neighbor was some distance away. She was unable to contact police during the time the object was there because she had no phone. Mrs. Page further stated that she saw the light come and that the "TV feed" and returned was the same as many neighbors. Mrs. Helen Chevalier, said later the "TV feed" did fluctuate and that she and her neighbors witnessed the same phenomenon.
