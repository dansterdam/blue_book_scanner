DESCRIPTION: Single steady white light, about like second-magnitude star.
First observed just north of Orion, apparently moving SW to NE. Passed
over horizon, still on straight line, after passing north of Polaris.
No course change, no apparent speed change. Estimate about 10 minutes
from horizon to horizon. No engine noise, no visible contrail through
IR glasses, no blinking or flickering. Looked like previously observed
artificial satellite. Sighting confirmed by two other witnesses.
