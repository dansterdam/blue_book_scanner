The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. The first is a compass rose diagram, with instructions to place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "+" at the position when last seen, and then connect the two with a line. The second illustration shows two landscape scenes, with a person standing in the foreground.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND THE "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. 

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a form with various sections for the witness to fill out details about the UFO sighting, such as the location, direction, and duration of the phenomenon. At the bottom of the form, there is a handwritten note stating "DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT 3 SEC. AT "B" IN #7 SKETCH".

The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a blank page from a document titled "What was the angular size, held a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or the moon - not how much of the object is covered by the head of the match - how is the size ratio to determine what fraction of the diameter of the object?" The text at the bottom of the page indicates this is page 6 of 9 pages.

As an OCR system, I would output the following text from the document:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON - NOT HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH - HOW IS THE SIZE RATIO TO DETERMINE WHAT FRACTION OF THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT?

The saucer two objects were sading out when the middle are shot ahead to the sight." Altitude of objects changed from 11,000' to about 15,000' in thee seconds interval in which they were sighted.

Lateran same night (June) 1952 an authority case was reported that had exploded while in the atmosphere and the witness had seen monerous sightings.

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENON WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON, OR SKYLINE WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "3" ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN. [A diagram is included showing the observer's field of view and position of the phenomenon.]

- page 49 -

The image contains a compass-like diagram and two sketches. The compass-like diagram appears to be a visual aid for describing the direction of a phenomenon when it was first seen. The two sketches depict a person standing in a landscape, possibly used to illustrate the relative size or appearance of the observed phenomenon.

TRANSCRIPT:

AS YOU ARE AT THIS MOMENT FACING COMPASS AS SHOWN, DO NOT MOVE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS IS ONLY APPROXIMATELY AND YOUR SKETCH NEED NOT BE HIGHLY DETAILED. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image contains a compass-like diagram in the top portion, which appears to be used for indicating the direction of an observed phenomenon. The lower portion of the image contains two sketches depicting the observed phenomenon, likely from the perspective of the observer. The sketches show a silhouetted figure in a landscape setting.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

THE INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS FURNISHED IN CONFIDENCE AND WILL BE HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "O" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO THE LARGE CIRCLE SKETCH.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

"IS IT STANDING STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
14. WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Not since I have had the experience of the object and the reminiscence of the incident that it caused. It is always the part of my attention that is caught in the instance of my concern.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

I was just seen, I must say, heard of their leaving seen.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

Of course, and as I say, my concern was with the object that I saw in the air and the incident that was caused by my seeing it. The first thing I noticed was the object hovering in the air moving back and forth across my vision, I would say, between 50 and 100 feet in the air. It remained in view for possibly 2 or 3 minutes and then suddenly it appeared to drop down behind some trees which were in the distance. That was the last I saw of it."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank page with handwritten text at the bottom providing instructions for observers to describe the angular size of an object, how much of the object is covered by the head of a match, and other observations related to the size and appearance of the observed object.

"WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW DO YOU HAVE REASON TO CONCLUDE THIS WAS THE APPROXIMATE SIZE OF THE OBSERVED OBJECT?"

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose diagram with labels indicating the cardinal directions. The second sketch shows two landscape views, one depicting a person standing on a road with a horizon in the distance, and the other showing a smaller landscape view.

Here is the text found in the document:

S.D. HOW IMAGINE AS YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
