what he thought was the burn in or
Echo II on the evening of 5 Jun 69.
A telephone call to S.D. C. (Sgt Magrath)
revealed that Echo II had not decayed
yet. Decays were as follows:

5 Jun
#2890 @ 0355 ± 5 min in S. ATLANTIC
#3223 @ 0922 ± 22 min in Australia

6 Jun
No decays.

[Redacted name] called again and said that
the sighting was prob. of a meteor. Time of
the sighting was 5 Jun 2250Z - 2300Z
and duration was about 30 sec. and APPROX.
direction of travel was E to W.

Called Mr. Citron of Smithsonian. Mr. Citron
confirmed that sighting was of a meteor.
It traveled az az 290 deg. and was
seen from Peoria, ILL to Omaha. It prob-
bably burned up in atmosphere.

Called [Redacted name] and gave him above info.

UFO Observation, 5 Jun 1969

[Redacted address]
Vancouver, Illinois 62253

The stimulus of your UFO sighting of 5 Jun 1969 has been identified by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory as a meteor. The meteor traveled on a heading of 290 degrees and was seen by thousands of persons in the Illinois, Missouri and Iowa areas. Because of the absence of sightings and sound near its computed impact point, it is believed that it burned up completely in the atmosphere.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Vehicle in which we were riding changed direction in relationship with sun, and this seems to rule out reflections from windshield.

The front two objects were fading out when the middle one shot ahead ie #10 figure 8

Altitude of objects changed from 1700' 80 about 1500' IN THE THREE SECOND INTERVAL IN WHICH THEY WERE SIGHTED.

LATER ON SAME NIGHT (JUNE) LAMBERT NEWS SAID FAA AUTHORITIES AT LAMBERT REPORTED THAT A METEOR HAD EXPLODED WISHES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THERE HAD BEEN NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS REPORTED.

I SINCERELY HOPE THAT I HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE, AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY EXTRA INFORMATION OR AREA OF EXPLANATION

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
I was standing in the middle of the sky completely so still that the night building was so close to me it blocked part of my view of the horizon and the object. The object behind flickered and was surprising at the altitude, slight point of light, and sometimes as before I last morning.
