Insufficient Note

Initial Report not received until 7 Feb 67
Investigation by Capt Conlin did not reveal
any explanation. Unable to get to perform
Proposed reply to Letter from Mr. & Mrs. [redacted], dated
9 February 1967

30 October 66
Cherry Hill, N. J.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your letter of 9 February 1967 reporting a recent unidentified flying object by yourself and other witnesses. The information submitted to the Air Force by way of your letter is insufficient for a detailed study. It is requested that you complete the enclosed FTD Form 164 so that a more comprehensive evaluation is possible. We would also appreciate it if your wife and the [redacted] would complete the Form 164.

We do not discourage the release of any type of information.
This is your privilege and not that of the Air Force.

Dear Friends:

After receiving your letter of March 16 I sent a copy of it (with your names and addresses omitted) to my friend Dr. E. W. Engstrom, president of the Radio Corporation of America.

He replies that "I have checked with a number of my associates and have not found anyone who is aware of any incident which would result in the report of the landing of an airship on the roof of an RCA building in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. From RCA's point of view, we believe that it is perfectly proper for the person who made this observation to explain to you exactly what he believed he saw on this occasion."

I suppose we will have to leave it at that unless you have some suggestions about other things that ought to be done.

Sincerely,

EUC:kes

Feb. 9, 1967

Dear Sir:

We learned of your position as head of Project Blue Book to investigate U.F.O., from the article published in LOOKS' special issue on Flying Saucers.

We have for some time been wondering whom to contact (as we do not want to be made fun of) to relate the mysterious flying machine We witnessed in flight as well as attached to the roof of one of our Nations' most prominent manufacturers of electronic and computing equipment.

We feel We should not give too much information at this writing as We do not want to write any description other than the fact We are impressed by its enormous size, shape, windows, and lights, this much We mention to convey to you that this incident did occur a more accurate and vivid description could be given, but in the event this is a classified or security type aircraft, as We understand you need security clearance to even enter the building on whose roof this aircraft was attached or hovering over, as there was a considerable amount of activity going on between the airship and the roof.

We were parked approximately 300 feet away and for the length of time of ten minutes and from two different locations, thus giving us a pretty good view. The aircraft first attracted our attention as it dropped from space at tremendous speed and brilliant light, as We were driving along a main highway, and it hovered over the car at about 45 miles an hour, at an altitude of about 150 feet. I wound down my window and leaned out of it I brought the car almost to a complete stop and this aircraft would not pass over, but just hung there as I looked up directly into the source of the bright lights that engulfed the highway.

We would like to know if We could release the description of this incident, as We feel after reading some of the sightings which are being mentioned, but none of them that We have read about can give an account such as what We witnessed and where it took place.

Sincerely Yours,
Mr. & Mrs. [redacted]

SAFOICC/Maj Rademacher/jaa/79079/19 Jun 67

JUN 19 1967

Dear Mr. and Mrs.

This replies to your recent correspondence of May 25, 1967 in which you requested information on your unidentified sighting of October 30, 1966.

Unfortunately, you did not bring your sighting to our attention until February 9, 1967. The delay in reporting your observation prevented a comprehensive investigation, since air activity records are normally destroyed after thirty days.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the UFO Investigator at McGuire AFB, New Jersey, T&gt Thomas J. Krupa, extension 4066.

Your observation has the flight characteristics of the Goodyear blimp. Therefore, we checked with the Goodyear Company in Akron, Ohio to determine whether this blimp was responsible for your sighting. On October 30, 1966 one blimp was in California and the other was enroute from Macon, Georgia to Dayton Beach, Florida.

A check of the records did not reveal any additional sightings on October 30, 1966 from the Cherry Hill, New Jersey area.

Sincerely,

I and my wife Mrs. [redacted], first encountered this strange aircraft, Sun., Oct. 30,1966, 1:30 A.M., daylight, saving time, while traveling west from Maple Shade, N.J., to Camden, N.J. on Rt. #38, in our 1966 Chev. Station Wagon at the intersection of Coles Ave. & Rt. #38 Circle traffic light, Cherry Hill, N.J., where we had stopped to wait for the green light, as we proceeded after the light changed from 0 to 4:5mph, the complete area became brilliantly lighted as if it had become daylight. I slowed down thinking the headlights had become dim and switched to high beam, and this seemed to make my difference. I stopped in the middle of the road as there was no one on the highway and looked through my window as best I could, as the window was up and closed due to the cold weather and saw this very large Dirigible shaped aircraft hovering left at tree top height facing west. I wound down my window and climbed half way out, and looked directly up at the starboard side of the ship which had a row of very large AMBER colored vertical windows whose surface was diffused, as if the surface or the windows were sand blasted to give them a degree of opacity. They are approximately 20 feet wide, and 30 feet high, running the entire length of the starboard side of ship, the ship yawed slightly and slipped sideways which was a controlled maneuver going north from south at tree top height with absolutely no noise, which passed directly over the car, I looked up right into the brilliant white as it hung motionless for a split second. These lights are very large round electric arc or quartz lights, there are two of these, one on each side of center line recessed into the bottom of the craft. I feel these are part of the propulsion and exhaust system, which are used in conjunction as landing lights.

I shouted to my wife to pick it up from the car side (passenger side) of the car which she did, as the ship moved over the car to the north and again hung motionless where we could see the complete port side, which had a row of AMBER colored windows the same as the starboard side, running the length of the ship. The ship hovered over the tree tops to our right about 100 feet to the north side of Rt. #38. After we viewed the port side of the ship for a minute or so we decided to continue on our way, not that we were afraid, but we had to pick up Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] of Lenola, N.J., who were waiting for us in Camden, N.J., which was the reason we were on the highway at that hour of the morning, also we felt the aircraft, if it were going to crash or make an emergency landing, it would be there when we made the return trip.

We picked up Mr. & Mrs. [redacted] as arranged, and on the way back, heading east on Rt. #38 about 3 A.M. we were explaining to the [redacted] the strange airship we saw, and that it might be still in the area where we saw it. We went under the overpass of Haddonfield road and slowed down to 10 mph, to scan the area for this aircraft. When we looked past the Cherry Hill Inn to the R C A Cherry Hill plant, this strange Dirigible type aircraft was attached to the roof of the R C A plant. The R C A plant was a mass of lights and considerable activity upon the roof. We pulled and parked at the entrance road to the plant still on Rt. #38 shoulder. We watched and made detailed study of the ship.

We parked there about 10 min. The ship is silver metallic, egg or dirigible shape, approx. 342 feet long, and about 138 feet high. It has approx. 14 windows (AMBER) on each side. These windows are approx. 20 feet wide, and 30 feet high, which forms an Amber band.

along each side. These windows when the ship is parked or hovering, or in flight approx. 50 mph land speed in our atmosphere are still amber in color. The nose of the ship is like a large beacon which covers the entire front cone, and pulsates as a white light, from which could see that a radar type probe aerial, protruding from the cone type light, which was made up from several curved sections to form the cone, as we could see the seams where the sections were joined together, and was connected to a line or a cable which was in contact with the R G A roof, in the area of one of the large tripod antennas, which extends 20 to 30 feet above the roof. There are several pulsating or blinking lights on the top edge of the ship from front to back. They are blue, green and red. They are very large globes or beacon type lamps, which pulsate at a controlled or regulated timing sequence, which appear to be running or flight clearance lights. The brilliant white light which emits from the bottom of the ship is only visible or on, when the ship is in flight, not while hovering or landing, as we saw it. There was no landing gear that looks like a cable type ladder to the roof of the R G A building, which could be hoisting cables of an entrance ramp.

We parked there for 10 min. then moved to the entrance of the Cherry Hill Apts., still on Rt. #38, at the parking lot. We then could observe the rear or tail of the aircraft. We vacated the area, because we felt we might be observed and over stay our welcome.

We are still puzzled about this astonishing aircraft, that we witnessed. We would like to have our experience published, but we do not want to violate security, if this ship is in any way connected with anything secret that the U.S. and R G A are working on, then we would refrain from any conversation about the subject. If on the other hand we could have your permission to publish this story, we would appreciate any information you would care to volunteer.

Dear Dr. [redacted]:

Reference your recent letter of June 20, 1967 concerning the most unusual sighting by the [redacted] and [redacted] near the RCA building on October 30, 1966.

We did receive a similar letter and requested they complete a Form 164. We contacted the Goodyear Corporation in Akron, Ohio, but they did not have one of their blimps in the area.

For your information, I am inclosing copies of the correspondence with Mr. and Mrs. [redacted]. This sighting was not reported to the Air Force until February 1967, too late to perform a comprehensive investigation. This sighting is being carried in our Unidentified Data category.

Sincerely,

Dr. [redacted]
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Dr. [redacted]:

We read your letter and we are grateful, you took the time to answer.

We, until the dirigible flew in over our car and looked as we described it the attached letter. We hardly ever gave the saucer reports any more than a passing glance, and hardly ever discussed them. Since we have been exposed to this airship, we started a little research program of our own, to find out about this dirigible. It is interesting what we have come up with, as most of our information has been found in our local library.

We have read where an airship that toured across a dozen states passing over many large cities of our country, and was seen by many people, that the ship was shaped like a dirigible, and this was before the zeppelin was ever invented, this took place in 1896 - 1897. The ship we describe fits the description of many of the sightings that I have read, which were made by pilots.

You mention writing directly to R C A, we did this through Dr. E.U. Condon, University of Colorado, who was in touch with Dr. E.W. Engstrom, president of R C A, Dr. Engstrom's reply, quote from Dr. E.U. Condon's letter to us of 4/14/67, as follows:- "I have checked with a number of my association and have not found anyone who is aware of any incident which would result in the report of the lending of an airship on the roof of an R C A building in Cherry Hill, N.J. From R C A's point of view, we believe that it is perfectly proper for the person who made this observation to explain to you exactly what he believed he saw on this occasion." This should answer your question about the possibility that it was a blimp, an or an advertising sign.

It seems incredible that this aircraft could fly and attached its' self to the roof of the Cherry Hill R C A building and cause then to light up the entire plant at such an early hour on a Sunday Morning and no one be aware of it, especially with the security that must exist in an industry doing Government work.

We hope you may be able to enlighten us about this worldly ship, as we have a question that comes up when ever we sit and talk about the sighting. The question is # 1 - If the ship is worldly and we saw it fly, what is the answer to Cape Kennedy and its efforts to go into space? - #2 - If the ship is from outer-space, what did we learn from it and what did they learn from us, the night the ship visited R C A, Cherry Hill, N.J.

If you could give us your views on these questions we would like to read them.

Yours truly,
Mr. & Mrs. [redacted]

My wife and I first encountered this strange aircraft Sunday, Oct. 30,1966, at 1:30 AT "EDT, while travelling west, in our 1966 Chev. Station Wagon, when at the intersection of Rt 33 and Coles Ave. circle with a traffic light in the center to control traffic going east and west. We stopped to wait the green light, as we proceeded after the light changed, going from 0 to 45 N.W. the complete area became brilliantly lighted as if it had become daylight. The slowed down blinking the headlights had become dim and switched to high beam and this seemed to make no difference. We stopped in the middle of the road as there was no one on the highway, as I looked through my window as best I could, as the window was up due to the cold weather, and saw this very large dirigible shaped aircraft hovering to my left at tree height, and looking or heading west. I wound down my window and looked half way out, and looked directly to the starboard side of the ship which had a row of very large AMBER colored windows, whose surface was diffused as if the surface of the window was sandblasted to give a degree of opacity. They are approximately 20 feet wide and 20 feet high, running the entire length of the starboard side of the ship. The ship then yawed slightly and slipped sideways, which was a controlled maneuver, going north from south at tree height with absolutely NO NOISE, which partially over the car. At this moment I had taken a seated position on the window sill with my arms upon the roof of the car, and looked up right into the brilliant white light as it hung motionless for a split second. Those lights are very large round electric arc or quartz type lights, there are two of them, one on each side of center line, recessed into the bottom of the craft. We estimate these lights to be about 10 feet in diameter, each. We feel these lights are part of the propulsion and exhaust system, which could be used in conjunction as landing lights, or as a steering device to control altitude and the attitude of the ship.

I shouted to my wife to pick it up on her side of the car (passenger side), which she did, as the ship moved over the car toward the north and again hung motionless, where we could see the complete port side of the ship, which also had a row of AMBER windows, which were the same as the starboard side, running the length of the port side. The ship hovered over the tree top to our right about 100 feet to the north side of Rt 33. After we viewed the port side of the ship for a minute or so we decided to continue on our way, not that we were afraid, but we had to pick up a Mr. [REDACTED] of Trenton, N.J., who were waiting for us in Camden, N.J., which was the reason we were on the highway at that hour of the morning, also as felt that this aircraft, if it were going to crash, or make an emergency landing, it would be there when we got back, as we pass there on the return trip.

We picked up Mr. [REDACTED] to accompany, and on the way back, heading east on Rt 33 about 3 A.M. to Trenton, we again saw this strange craft, then as located ship, that we saw and that it might be still in the area where we saw it, we passed under the overpass of Haddonfield Road, Cherry Hill, N.J. and slowed down to about 10 MPH or so, to scan the area. For this strange aircraft, when we located it again, it was hovering or hovering above the roof of the RCA plant. The RCA plant was a mass of lights and considerable activity upon the roof. We pulled up and parked at the entrance road to the plant. We watched and made a detailed study of the ship between us. We parked there for about 10 minutes.

The ship in delivery, satellite, egg or dirigible shape, approximately 5 1/2 feet long, and 12 1/2 feet wide, is approximately 14 feet high, with a very small base. These windows are approximately 20 feet wide and 30 feet high, which forms an AMBER band down each side. These windows when the ship is parked or hovering, are at flight at approximately 50 feet high and approximately 50 feet from the RCA roof. The top of the ship is large hexagon white light for which we could not determine the purpose, other than a protruding part. The cone type lights, and those at the end of the ship, we could not determine the contact with the RCA roof, in the area of the large lighted hexagon, which seemed to be the control center.

extends 20 to 30 foot above the roof. There are several pulsating or blinking lights on the edge of the ship at the top, from front to back, they are BLUE, GREEN, and RED. They are very large globes or beacon type lamps which pulsate at a controlled or regulated timing sequence. These appear to be running or flight lights. The brilliant white light which emits from the bottom, is only visible or on when the ship is in flight, not while hovering or landed as we saw it. There was no landing gear visible while in flight or hovering or landed.

There appears to be a section of the round bottom part of the ship which resembles an exit or entrance way, by what looks like a cable type ladder to the roof of the R G A building, which could be the hoisting cables or an entrance ramp.

We parked there for about 10 minutes, and then moved to the Cherry Hill Apts., parking lot entrance, and parked there for about 5 mins, and observed the tall or roof of the ship. We vented the area, became to felt we might beobserved and overstay our welcome.

The cone type light on the nose of the airship was made up from several curved sections to form the cone, as we could see the seams where the sections were joined together. This light is also made from material that appears to be sand-blasted, and diffused to give the opacity similar to the AMER windows.

These lights do not blink as one would say a light blinks in a sign or a display, but goes off at a very lazy pulsing, or as if a second passes between the on and off.

There are several other witnesses, who saw the dirigible, the same night, and shortly before we saw it at the traffic light.

Mr. Mrs.
Maple Shade, New Jersey 03052

Dear Mr. Mrs.

Thank you for your letter of June 15. I have no idea what it was you saw. You have given so few facts. In the first place, I do not in any sense believe that you saw a dirigible. I do not believe it was any form of a ship. It had nothing whatever to do with Cape Kennedy I am sure. And again I am quite sure that the ship does not come from outer space. My only point in writing you is to try to find out whether indeed you really saw something. And second, what kind of stimulus it was that provoked your reaction.

I am well aware of the mythical air ship of 1896-97. And indeed your description so fits the sightings of that period that I feel there is definitely some sort of relationship. I have discussed these sightings in both of my books, "Flying G saucers," published by the Harvard University Press in 1953, and in "The World of Flying Saucers," by Donald H. Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd, published by Doubleday. The first you may be able to get in your library. The second one is still in print and available at your booksellers. It is well recognized that the 1896-97 sightings were a combination of hoaxes and natural phenomena, viewed with the imagination of the various people.

Your descriptions are too detailed, too pat. If something of this sort had been in the area we should have had hundreds of reports, not just a few.

We do not know whether the sky was clear or cloudy or many other things. One explanation that comes to my mind is that a bright searchlight on clouds might have produced something similar to what you reported.

Sincerely yours,

DH/Mab
Donald H. Menzel
