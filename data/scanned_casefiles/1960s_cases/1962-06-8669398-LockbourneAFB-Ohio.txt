k. Lt Rudolph J. Kelsaac Jr., Intelligence Officer. Immediately after the sighting was reported I personally made checks with the Base tower, Local Columbus tower, Columbus approach control, and local police department with negative results. The son, both veterans, one with 19 years on the flight line, were consulted. They both stated that they had never seen anything like it before. One possible explanation is an inversion reflection, however, my explanation is very limited in this area.

l. N/A.
