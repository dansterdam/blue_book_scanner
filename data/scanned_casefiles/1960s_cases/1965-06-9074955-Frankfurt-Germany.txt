SUBJECT: UFO Report

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

1. The attached UFO report was given to the Rhein-Main Base Operations Officer on 19 July 1965. The source is a Federal Aviation Agency flight inspector. He could not identify the object. The total flight was observed.

2. Major xxxxxxxxx of this Detachment talked to him by telephone at his home. There was very little that could be added to the written-up description. The aircraft was under radar control but radar did not see the object. The other pilot was not notified in time to see it and the control was not in the area at the time.

3. Since so much time had lapsed since the sighting it was decided not to transmit the report by electrical means.

4. Further information can be collected from the source of this information should FDID desire further coverage.

At the time the UFO disappeared, I noted the time to be 1345 local (1245z). The total time of the UFO sighting was no more than two to three minutes.

It is interesting to note:

a. During the sighting, all the clouds in the general area maintained their relative position and as the UFO maneuvered, it was easy to observe its relative position in R-250.

b. The presence of these clouds and the haze layer had a tendency to camouflage the visual sighting of the UFO.

c. The UFO maintained its altitude within the top of the haze layer. Because of this I was not able to discern its exact shape or substance.

d. It left no trail and flew through the atmosphere blending well with the existing weather phenomena that prevailed at that time.
