11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Round white object observed in clouds and haze layer on course intercepting observers a/c and then turning in front at distance of about 5 miles and disappearing by fading. Speed of observers a/c 190 knots. Size of object was much greater than transport a/c. Object appeared only in clouds and no features were noted. Observer a/c descending for final approach to land. Haze and cloud layer at 5,000 ft.

COMMENTS: Object observed only during descent. Duration and speed in accord with jet a/c. Size much greater than 4 engine transport. Sighting evaluated as the reflection or a/c on the haze layer. If observers a/c was turning as it started to descend it is possible that the reflection was from the observers own a/c. If the observers a/c was in straight flight then another a/c is the likely source of this reflection. Was conditions on this position of sun consistent with this analysis.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: FE-1

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: FTD (EDS)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. The attached UFO report was given to the Rhein-Main Base Operations Officer on 19 July 1965, the source is a Federal Aviation Agency Flight Inspection Pilot. His total flight time was not available.

2. Major [redacted] of this Detachment talked to him by telephone at his home. There was very little that could be added to the write-up. The aircraft was under radar control but radar did not see the object. The other pilot was not notified in time to see it and the engineer was not in the cockpit at the time.

3. Since so much time had lapsed since the sighting it was decided not to transmit the report by electrical means.

4. Further information can be collected from the source of this information should FTD desire further coverage.

At the time the UFO disappeared, I noted the time to be 1345 Local (1245z). The total time of the UFO sighting was no more than two to three minutes.

It is interesting to note:

a. During the sighting, all the clouds in the general area maintained their relative positions and as the UFO maneuvered as described above, it was easy to observe its relative position in reference to these clouds and N-250.

b. The presence of these clouds and the haze layer had a tendency to camouflage the visual sighting of the UFO.

c. The UFO maintained its altitude within the top of the haze layer. Because of this I was not able to discern its exact shape or substance.

d. It left no trail and flew through the atmosphere blending well with the existing weather phenomena that prevailed at that time.
