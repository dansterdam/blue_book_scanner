11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were awaken when a fireplace screen fell. When they looked out of a window they noticed a red light going overhead. The light would get brighter, then dimmer, bright, then dim, etc. The object near the horizon, a couple of minutes another red, to dim, to bright, object appeared going more westward.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. Contact with Base Operations revealed that several aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting, any accounting for the observation.

Child was awakened by a bright screen falling over, saw a red body, and thought it was a pretty scarce, but thin car-like object, made his sister and showed it to her.

I was didn't actually see till after 6:30, although object was seen at 4:05.

This reported sighting was dictated to his sister.

Call from Mr. [redacted] 18 Nov 1966 revealed that two of his children awoke at approximately 0405 this morning, 18 Nov 66, when a fireplace screen fell.

They looked out the window and noticed a red light going overhead. The light would get brighter, then dimmer, brighter, then dimmer, repeating the process until it got nearer the horizon when a light like a star appeared and the red light disappeared.

The star like object faded into the distance. A couple of minutes later another red, to dim, to brighter, object appeared going more West. His children said the object was visible for approximately 1½ minutes. However, Mr. [redacted] said his children did not know how to estimate time and they could mean seconds or many minutes. His children came and woke him up after the objects disappeared. He got up but could see nothing.

FTD Forms 164 were forwarded to Mr. [redacted] for his children's completion.

Objects were going in a southerly direction.
