There was only the one object?
One object was all I saw.

Were there any discernible features such as you find on manned aircraft - wing section, tail...?
Negative. I saw only a slender object. I don't know what the shape was. It was only a slender object.

Did there appear to be any tail, trail, or exhaust?
Negative. There was no exhaust, no trail following after it. It was clearly defined. I saw it for a period of maybe two seconds.

Was there any sound?
There was no sound to the best of our knowledge. The aircraft, of course, is noisy. We all had head sets on. But we heard no sound accompanying the glow.

Was there any shock wave?
We felt no shock wave. The air was smooth and calm and the aircraft remained such.

Were there any other pertinent or unusual features?
Not that I recall.

And the thing that first called you attention to the object itself was the intense light almost directly overhead?
That is affirmative.

Now, when you observed the object itself, could you give anything on the angle or elevation?
I can only give the elevation in terms of the aircraft attitude and that was 10 to 20 degrees, when I first spotted it, lower than the aircraft and it looked like it was at an angle approximately 10 to 20 degrees from the vertical or 70 to 80 degrees from the horizontal.

What was the azimuth, the bearing, from the aircraft?
The bearing from the aircraft would be approximately 65 to 75 degrees from the nose of the aircraft. I believe the nose of the aircraft was then about 130 to 140 magnetic, heading, somewhere in there.

And it was approximately the same angle, elevation, azimuth, at the time it disappeared?
That is correct. At the time that it passed from my sight, either it disappeared or the aircraft got in the way of it. I don't know what happened to it.

Would you describe the flight path?
The flight path of the object was approximately, from the way our aircraft was turning - the light source was originally hidden from us and then when I say it, I was off to the left of us. I would say the flight path of the object would be from the southwest to a northeast direction.

The object, then, disappeared on the same slant (?)?
That is correct.

And in what manner did it disappear - suddenly, fading out, or...?
I don't know. To me it was just all of a sudden not there.

Now, I turned to check the aircraft as well as watch it and I don't know what happened to it. Perhaps the rate of turn of the aircraft made it disappear from my sight. I don't know.

Were you in a position where you could watch the ground?
I could not watch the ground immediately under me because the aircraft was still in about a 25 degree bank. I could see the ground to the left of me. However, everything was black by then and I couldn't distinguish unless there were lights on the ground
(?) by this time.

Then, there was no indication of an explosion or any more light when the object hit the ground.
No, I looked behind me and to the bost of my knowledge, there was no such explosion or any indication that it did hit the ground.

You mentioned that at the time you saw this object, that it must have been lower than the surrounding mountains.
Yes.

And that the object was between you and the mountains?
There was a moon and we could see the black shape of the mountains around us and the object was lower than the mountains to E of our position.

From the time the illumination began until the time the object disappeared, could you estimate the time?
We estimated the time to be a minimum of 10 seconds. We did this because we had better than 90 degrees to turn and we had started to turn. We had turned approximately 30 degrees while at it started to get light and during this time we turned a minimum of another 30 degrees. The aircraft was making close to a standard rate of turn, perhaps a little bit less or a little bit more, I don't know, but maybe we could about a minimum of 30 degrees lasted about 10 seconds or longer.

With regard to the object itself, how long would that have been visible?
I saw the object for not more than two seconds, I think. This is very difficult to estimate the time, but I don't think that it was more than two seconds. It was moving rapidly, comparable to a shooting star.

Would you give the type and number of your aircraft?
We were flying a C-119 aircraft. Our tail numbers 538093 and our call sign for the night was "drunk 33." There were five persons aboard including myself.

And the altitude was 8500 feet?
That is affirmative.

And the heading prior to the turn and heading of the new course?
Approximately 065 degrees to a heading of 165 degrees.

And the speed was 170.
Yes.

And home station is Hill AFB?
That is affirmative.

In regard to the date of 18 April, the Zulu time would have been...?
0319 Zulu.
Local time...?
2019 hours

In regards to light conditions, it would have been night time?
It was night time. There is practically a full moon out tonight.
There were no clouds directly above us.
Is it possible to estimate ceiling visibility at night?
There was no ceiling above us. Visibility was very good. We
could see 30 or 40 miles through the country. There were no
obstructions to visibility at our flight level.
Now, at the time of the sighting, would you, again, describe your
location with regard to ground objects.
We were approximately two miles West of La Van, Utah. There is
a road running from La Van, west. It makes a 90 degree left turn
to a southerly heading. We were just short of that bend when we
made our turn. We rolled out, probably, right over the highway
when we finally established on a heading of 165 degrees.
What is your age?
I will be 50 in July.
You are a regular in the Air Force?
Negative, I am a reservist.
How much regular and reservist time do you have?
I was commissioned in August 1954. I served three years on
active duty and I have been flying with the reservists since 1958.
I have about 2300 hours flying time.
And your civilian occupation?
I am an attorney at law.
You mentioned other crewmen. Would you give me their rank, name
and also duty station.
Lt Larson was the navigator in the navigator's seat. Sgt Stenquist
was the crew chief in the jump seat. Altman Jacobs was the student
crew chief in the crew chief position. All are members of the 733
Troop Carrier Squadron stationed at Hill.
Did they all witness the object?
I was the only individual who saw the object itself. Of course
everybody in the aircraft saw the intensity of the light.

I think that will be all for the purpose of the recording.
Thank you very much.

Flash, Boom Over Utah
Fireball Lights
Skies In Ten States

The huge "ball of fire" which flashed across the Western U. S. between 8:15 and 8:19 pm on 18 April 1962 was so brilliant that it triggered the photoelectric street lighting system in Eureka, Utah. The object was traveling from east to west. All street lights turned off in Eureka as the object passed over.

Authorities thought the fireball crashed about 16 miles south of the small town. Residents saw a "blue flash" and heard a "rumbling" off in the distance immediately after the sighting.

Salt Lake City observers said the light of the "meteor" was as "bright as day."

It was seen in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, Kansas and Utah. An FAA spokesman at Salt Lake City said the object was published over southwestern Utah about 35 miles northeast of Delta, "as also said aircraft and ground observers in the area" confirmed. The report.

Although not definitely established, man at Peterson Field (Colorado Springs, Colo.) was of Pike's Peak, may have been connected with the sighting.

The light was obscured by the mountain.

Air Force officers from Hill AFR at Ogden, Utah, questioned sheepherders in this south of Eureka, Utah, who saw a "blue-white light brighter than day" and then continued on, looking like a vapor trail from a jet. He estimated it was 8 to 10 seconds before the sound became audible, sounding like cannons firing in the distance.

Most observers, Nevada declared the object was traveling west to east.

The thought occurs that this object was a perfect high-altitude flare—illuminating most of a twostate area to a point of daylight brightness. It so happens that the two states receiving most of the light were Utah and Nevada, both locations of U. S. Missile and nuclear test sites.


- page 5 -

A front page headline story from Las Vegas, dated April 19, tells of a "trembling flaming sword" which flashed across the mysterious object, traveling on a horizontal course, was also seen in several other western states, and it was tracked on radar. According to a UFO report, the Air Force stated that the object landed near Eureka, Utah. A spokesman for the 25th Air Division at Stout Air Force Base in Reno insisted that the cover of Force Base had been scrambled as a result of the radar sightings.

On April 13, 1962 the Air Force Defense Command was puzzled by an aerial object that exploded and seemed to be a meteor, but had the unique distinction of being tracked by radar 70 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as chased by jets, before it exploded in Nevada. In hindsight, an Air Force Defense Command alert reported the object was tracked and traced over New York, Kansas, Utah, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona and California, so that its light covered almost as much area as that centered by the big hydrogen space bomb test held later in the Pacific hundreds of miles high.

UFO Sighting (Jan 19 April 1962)                                8 August 1962

MCJSAS
REPORT-DB (Major Bart)
Wash 25 DC

1. At 0319Z on 19 April 1962 and unidentified flying object, described by the witnesses as a very brilliant object, moving at tremendous speed, was sighted near Eureka, Utah, in the western part of the United States. The object was reported to have impacted in Utah and the injury of the ground was sustained. (Attachment A)

2. AFR 200-2, 16 September 1959, the Air Force directive covering the unidentified flying objects program assigns the responsibility for investigating such sightings to the nearest Air Force base, in compliance with par 40 of this document, personnel from Hill AFB, Utah investigating the 19 April 1962 incident. (Attachment A1)

3. On 15 July 1960 during a briefing on the USAF's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program, to members of the House Science and Astronautics Committee, House Science and Astronautics Committee and CIA, Mr. Robert Osgood of the House Armed Services Committee stated that due to the usually limited technical capability of the Air Force cases, FTD was particularly interested in those cases which give indication of having high intelligence and/or scientific potential, and also those which have unusual account of public interest. Some work has made several follow-ups on his recommendation and FTD has in very instance indicated compliance.

4. The note contained in par 40 of AFR 200-2, 16 September 1959, spells out a requirement for FTD to document additional investigation when it is determined that additional information is required to further conclude its analysis of findings.

5. The number of reports generated by the 19 April 1962 sighting, and the fact that the Air Force investigation came to a negative conclusion, resulting the UFO, they believe, was a "meteor" (Attachment A1), prompted further investigation by FTD. This was investigated by Lt Col Robert J. Pratt, FTD, and Capt J. Allan Myers, Air Force Consultant to the UFO program, on 7 May 1962. This investigation was completed in one full day and the conclusion that the object was a solid, unknown was made.

to locate the object but this effort failed due to the general nature of the area. Further study of this sighting indicates that the meteorite probably struck in the area of the Wasatch National Forest; however, the Air Force has made no further attempts to recover it.

3. Seven residents of Nephi, Utah (39 34N, 111 50W) were interviewed in an attempt to establish the location of the source of illumination as well as a description and direction of travel of the object. Each of the persons interviewed agreed that the illumination was a ball of fire traveling over Nephi. Further that the object generally described as a yellowish white ball of fire traveled in a northwesterly direction over Nephi, leaving a trail of fire behind it. That approximately three to five minutes after the object disappeared in the northwest, the sound of a sonic boom was heard. The data that after the object disappeared in this northwest direction, not observers explained the sound as like a sonic boom.

4. Three residents of Leamington, Utah (39 32N, 112 17W) were interviewed in an attempt to obtain a cross bearing on the direction of travel of the object.

SAFSL-L/Maj [redacted]/nia/57394/8 Aug 62
CASDE: 217652

AUG 10 1962

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your recent communication in behalf of Mr. [redacted] concerning the fireball witnessed by him on April 18, 1962.

The event noted by Mr. [redacted] was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force, because of the unusual amount of public interest, as well as the potential. Depositions were taken from several well-regarded individuals in the Lynndyls, Leamington, Silver City, Salt Lake and Eureka areas of Utah. An attempt was made to recover particles of the object. The preliminary examination of various witnesses indicated the probable location to be in a virtually inaccessible valley 10 to 15 miles long in the Wasatch National Forest.

Detailed studies of the depositions have led to the conclusion that the object was a bolide that exploded as it neared the surface of the earth. Several of the depositions reported one big explosion followed by 20 to 30 smaller explosions lined up in a pattern.

Your continued interest in Air Force matters is appreciated.

Sincerely,

6. Four sheepmen and herders located at Jericho, Utah (39 45'N, 112 14'W) were interviewed on 19 April 1962 at the scene of an unusual occurrence. The men interviewed concurred that the object passed east of Jericho on a north-west heading. After their observation, the object was described as a bright object, which persons observed the object pass over the immediate area. The object was a ball of flame or trail passing over the immediate area. The descriptions of the 20 to 30 min explorers were generally agreed, with the noise likened to that of an anti-aircraft fire.

7. On 19 April 1962 Mr. [REDACTED] was interviewed at the Silver City Mine at Silver City, Utah, and the following information obtained:

15a(1) Shape - Round ball of fire.

15a(2) Size - About the size of a soccer ball.

15a(3) Color - White with a yellowish tint and a bright yellow jagged flame coming from the rear of the object.

15a(4) Number - One.

15a(5) Formation - None.

15a(6) Discernible Features - None he could see.

15a(7') Trail, trail or exhaust - The object had a bright yellowish flame coming from rear. After object passed overhead, a dark gray smoke trail remained in the sky.

15a(8) Sound - Object emitted a gasping sound three or four times when it slowed down. In flight, then ceased to again. After object had burned out, approximately 20 sharp explosions were heard in direction from which object came.

15a(9) Pertinent Features - Yellow jagged flame at rear of object. After object had slowed up and surged ahead or burned out, the flame at the rear of object turned from yellow to blue, and jagged ends of trailing flame turned into a sharp pointed flame as it rose.

15a(10) What called attention to object - Bright illumination overhead caused him to look up and see object.

15a(11) Angle, elevation and azimuth - Object traveled northwest over mountain east of his location on a flat trajectory. Could not estimate altitude.

15a(12) Angle, elevation and azimuth at time of disappearance - Traveling north-west with descending angle. Below top of mountains to west (5,000 feet).

15a(13) Flight path and maneuvers - As object passed over JERICHO, it slowed down in air, and after passing sound area moved again. After this procedure was repeated three or four times, the object slowed over and began descending to earth after which object turned bluish, then dark or burnt out, still on northwest heading. After object began to slow down it began to wobble or "lighttail" in its path.

15a(14) How did object disappear - After beginning to move over toward the ground, the object turned dark or burned out, still on northwest heading.

15a(15) How long object visible - Two or three seconds.

that each of the observers interviewed was located, in such a manner that each
person was convinced that he had observed some tangible object, not identifiable as
an known or conventional type aircraft.  The investigating officer, who has reviewed
aircraft log data, plus the facts and circumstances of the sighting, including the
objects, plus the fact that no pre-recorded meteorological or national conditions were present, which would furnish
an explanation for the sighting.  As result the preliminary analysis concludes that

Falling meteor is questioned due to the statements of three observers describing
the flat trajectory, plus the description of sounds emitting from the object
and the unusual 6-7 mile "radar" call. The object was seen falling to the ground.
Due to the inaccessibility of the valley, ten miles wide by 16 miles long, an
additional ground search was not possible. The object was plotted on the chart
is contemplated. With the completion of this initial report, no explanation
has been developed for the brilliant illumination of the area, the object
itself, or the explosions in the wake of the object.

MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFI
ATTN: MR. [redacted]

SUBJECT: Proposed Reply to [redacted]

The April 13th, 1962 event noted by [redacted] was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force because of the unusual amounts of public interest. As well as the scientific potential, individuals were taken from several well marked individual sites in the Tyndale, Lewiston, Silver City, Salt Lake, Dugway areas of Utah. An attempt was made to recover particles of the object, but correlation of testimony by various witnesses indicated the probable location to be in a virtually inaccessible valley to 15 miles long in the Wasatch National Forest.

Detailed study of the depositions have lead to the conclusion that the object was a "bolide" that exploded as it neared the surface of the earth. Several of the depositions reported the big explosion followed by 20-30 similar explosions likened to anti-aircraft fire.

Lt. Colonel Robert Friland and Dr. J. Allen Hynek conducted the investigation for the Air Force. Detailed reports are on file in this office.

SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL 15 (UPI)--A BRIGHT "FIREBALL" AND "FLASHES OF LIGHT" WERE SIGHTED IN THE SKY TONIGHT BY PERSONS THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. IT WAS SIGHTED AS A METEOR. SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED AS FAR EAST AS GRIDLEY, KAN. AND IN NEVADA, LOS ANGELES, ARIZONA, UTAH, CENTRAL PATROL, NEW MEXICO, REPORTS WERE MADE, INCLUDED UTAH, IDAHO, MONTOUR, NEW MEXICO.

IN THE CENTRAL UTAH AREA, RESIDENTS ALSO REPORTED HEARING RUMBLING SOUNDS AND EXPLOSIONS.

OBSERVERS IN NEPHI--ABOUT 90 MILES SOUTH OF SALT LAKE CITY--SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO PASS DIRECTLY OVER THE CITY FROM EAST TO WEST.

IN SALT LAKE CITY, OBSERVERS AT THE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT SAID THEY SAW THREE SEPARATE FLASHES OF LIGHT--ONE, TWO, AND THREE AS DAY.

THE SOUND HEARD IN NEPHI HAS DESCRIBED LIKE A SONIC "BOOM" WHILE RESIDENTS IN SPRINGVILLE--40 MILES TO THE NORTH--REPORTED SEPARATE EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS. IN NEARBY PROVO, THE SOUND WAS DESCRIBED AS A RUMBO SUCH EXPLOSIONS WHICH FOLLOWED THE FLASHES BY 8-9 MINUTES.

UNIVERSITY OF UTAH PROF. ROBERT MADAECH SAID THE EXPLOSION COULD HAVE BEEN THE DISINTEGRATION OF A METEOR IN THE AIR. HE DESCRIBED SUCH EXPLOSIONS AS A COMMON PHENOMENA. HE SAID THE OTHER EXPLOSIONS COULD HAVE BEEN REVERBERATIONS OF THE FIRST.

EUREKA, UTAH, APRIL 15 (UPI) - A FIERY METEORITE BURNED A TRAIL THROUGH WESTERN SKIES LAST NIGHT BEFORE EXPLODING HERE WITH A BRILLIANCE THAT TURNED IT AS "BRIGHT AS DAY" 15 MILES AWAY.

WITNESSES SAID THE METEORITE STREAKED THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE UNTIL IT EXPLODED ABOUT 15 MILES SOUTH OF THE SMALL CENTRAL UTAH COMMUNITY.

POLICE CHIEF JOSEPH BERNINI SAID RESIDENTS SAW A "BLUE FLASH" EXPLOSION AND A "ROLLING OF THE DICE" THEN HEARD THE BLAST.

THE FLASH WAS SO BRIGHT THAT EUREKA'S STREET LIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY WENT OFF AS THE PHOTOCELLS COULD "QUICKLY" PICK UP THE BLAST.

SALT LAKE CITY, 70 MILES NORTH OF THE EXPLOSION SITE, THE BLAST WAS HEARD IT AS "SHARP LIKE AN EXPLOSION".

MOST OBSERVERS REPORTED THE FLEET "FIREBALL" WAS TRAVELING FROM EAST TO WEST OVER CENTRAL UTAH (NEAR) DELTA, HOWEVER, THEY SAID THE TOWER AT SALT LAKE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT SAID THERE WERE THREE SEPARATE FLASHES, APPARENTLY EXPLOSION OBSERVERS IN SOUTHERN UTAH REPORTED SEEING TRAILS OF SMOKE FOR SEVERAL MILES AFTER THE METEORITE PASSED.

Dear Professor,

I received your letter and thanks for the check. I appreciate it.

We took a ride out to Vernon the other day and talked to Mr. Vernon, he was just as positive of the angle he had seen the meteor as when you talked with him. He asked him about the distance he had seen it travel, as you requested, and he held his hands about two feet apart at arms length.

By wife was able to get the two clippings of two of them for you. I am enclosing a letter I received in response to the newspaper article. It will speak for itself. Could it be possible that some place that had broken from the main meteor?

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

P.S. The day my wife and I went to Vernon we went about 30 miles further west and onto the desert in hopes we might find someone to talk to that might have seen something. First, I was a day run. This is in the general direction you figured it to be traveling and I think it may be on a 11th Canyon. First, I believe, I make regular trips out in the area and will make it a point to make inquiries every chance I get. We want to know if anyone on River Bottom, you may be able to find it on your map.

Reward Offered
For Finding
April 27 Meteor

By MRS. AGNES PETERSON
Desert News Correspondent

EUREKA — A professor of
astronomy from Northwestern
University has offered a $100
reward to anyone believed to
have found a meteor that
crashed to earth south of Eureka after streaking through
western skies last April 18.

Prof. J. Alan Hynek conducted a search of the area
Tuesday with two Air Force men and three Eureka
residents, but found nothing.
"We covered a lot of ground
and had no luck, but we intend to try again," the professor
said. The search was centered
in an area about 5 to 10 miles
south and west of Eureka.
Prof. Hynek said the meteor
was probably within 20
or 30 miles.

He said he believed that
sheepherders or someone in the
area will eventually find the
rock from outer space. To aid
said search, he is offering
anyone who finds it just to
make things interesting.

The meteorite has no intrinsic value, he said, but was very
valuable for scientific study.

Here is the text from the document:

Northwestern University scientist, officers investigate Tintic area

Professor J. Allen Hynek, chairman of the Astronomy Dept. at Northwestern University, and two city in Evanston, Ill., and two Wright Patterson, Air Force men in Dayton, Ohio, and another from Hill Field were in town last week, where they joined Gerald Peterson, Hi-Way Patrol, Deseret News reporter, and the group spent almost an entire day. They are looking for the elevation and the bearing at the time the meteorite burned out in this area. (Mr. was supposed to have Mr. Robinson in West Tintic the time the meteor blazed through the sky and had a "ring-side" seat so to speak.) Prof. Hynek is offering a $100 reward to the finder of the meteorite, as it will be very valuable for scientific information. Prof. Hynek stated that there are two distinct types of meteorites, which will be quite different from the norm. One is an iron nickel meteorite, which is extremely heavy, the other a stony meteorite with nodules, with metallic imbedding.

Anyone having definite information regarding the meteor is asked to contact Mrs. Peterson in Eureka, and he will then be wired the finding to Prof. Hynek.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Utah 19 April 1962)                     2 August 1962

1. At 0300 on 19 April 1962 and unidentified flying object, described
by the witnesses as a very brilliant object, while traversing open,
and creating explosive sounds, was observed in the vacinity of the
Tintic District. The object was reported to have traversed in Utah and the
nearby air base near Dugway. (Attachment #1)

2. DR 200-2, 14 September 1959, the Air Force directive severing the
unidentified flying objects program designates the responsibility for
investigating sightings to the nearest Air Force base. In compliance
with par 6 of this document, personnel from Hill AFB, Utah investigating the 19 April 1962 incident. (Attachment #2)

3. On 15 July 1962 during a briefing on the USAF's Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena Program to members of the House Armed Services
Committee, House Science and Astronautics Committee and CI, Mr. Robert
Ghart of the House staff provided convincing evidence that the
usually limited technical capability of the Air Force base, FTD
should preclude the investigation of these many sightings. In addition
having high intelligence and/or scientific potential, and also those
which have an unusual amount of public interest. The Staff has made
several follow-ups on his recommendation and FTD has in every instance
indicated concurrence.

4. The note contained in par 6 of DR 200-2, 14 September 1959,
spells out a requirement for FTD to conduct additional investigation
when it is determined that additional information is required to
further or conclude its analysis of findings.

5. The number of reports generated by the 18 April 1962 sighting,
and the fact that the Air Force Investigators seem to a negative
conclusion regarding the UFO, they indicated a could not be
a matter (attachment #3), prevented further investigation by FTD.
This was an investigation by Lt Col Robert A. Frazier, Capt
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Air Force Consultant to the UFO program, on
7 May 1962. This investigation was completed in one full day and
it was concluded that the object was a bolide. An attempt was made

Eureka, 
Utah

Dear 

Thanks very much for your recent letter and for the newspaper clippings. I am especially happy to get the additional information from Dr. [redacted]. Of course I am very pleased over the newspaper coverage we got and I hope that it brings in some real responses.

It looks now as though my daughter and I will be driving west for a conference at Boulder, Colorado, after which we'll like to come by Eureka for a day or two and check up on a few more angles and pictures. It would also give me a chance to find out whether anything more has been done by anyone else in trying to locate the Fallon meteorite. If our plans materialize, we would be in Eureka about June 24 or 25. It would be a pleasure seeing you again and maybe you and I could drive around a bit and talk to a few more people.

The letter from the woman who was driving east to Salt Lake City is interesting and does indicate that it might have been possible for a portion of the meteorites to have broken off and landed near them. On the other hand, her report is so similar to that of the much farther south [redacted] that I cannot think that these people were blinded by the bright light and completely underestimated the distance of the phenomenon.

Please give my best regards to Mrs. [redacted] and to the others of our "search camp".

Cordially,

J. Allen Hynek

The text in the document is partially illegible due to the handwritten nature and image quality. However, I can make out some parts:

At the top of the page, there appears to be a header with some blacked-out text.

The first few lines seem to reference a location (possibly Eureka) and some details about a report or incident.

The body of the text is mostly handwritten and difficult to fully transcribe. Some words and phrases are visible, but not enough to confidently reproduce the entire text.

At the bottom of the page, there are more blacked-out lines and what appears to be "Belen, N. Mex." written.

The document appears to be a handwritten report or statement, likely related to a UFO sighting or investigation from the Project Blue Book era.

UFO Sighting (Utah 19 April 1962)                     2 August 1962

Wash 25 DC

1.    At 0517Z on 19 April 1962 and unidentified flying object, described by the witnesses as a very bright object, moving at tremendous speed, and creating explosive sounds, was observed in the western part of the United States. The object was recorded to have increased in Utah and the majority of the reports originated in that state. (Attachment #1)

2.    AFR 200-2, 14 September 1959, the Air Force directive covering the unidentified flying objects program assigns the responsibility for investigating sightings to the nearest Air Force base. In compliance with par 46 of this document, personnel from Hill AFB, Utah Investigation (Attachment #2) made initial contact.

3.    On 15 July 1960 during a briefing on the USAF's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program, no members of the House Armed Services Committee, House Science and Astronautics Committee, and City of the House Armed Services Committee stated that due to the usually limited technical capability of the Air Force bases, they should conduct the investigation of those cases which give indication of having high intelligence and/or scientific potential, and also those which have an unusual cosmic or public interest. He has made several follow-ups on his recommendation and FTD has in every instance taken cognizance.

4.    The note contained in par 46 of AFR 200-2, 14 September 1959, spells out a requirement for FTD to conduct additional investigation. Then it is determined that additional information is required to further or conclude its analysis of findings.

5.    The number of reports generated by the 18 April 1962 sighting, and the fact that the Air Force investigations came to a negative conclusion regarding the UFO, they indicated it couldn't have been a meteor (Attachment #1), prompted further investigation by FTD. This investigation was accomplished by Lt Col Robert J. Friend, FTD, and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Air Force Consultant to the UFO program, on 17 May 1962. This investigation was completed in one day and it was concluded that the object was a bolide. An attempt was made

FROM: HQ USAF/DIROPS
TO: SAFLL/W, WASH DC

Falling meteor is questioned due to the statements of these observers describing the flat trajectory, plus the description of source calming from the object. This account of the incident falls clear of the final report. Flat trajectory plus the description of source calming from the object, plus to the inaccessibility of the valley, ten miles wide by 15 miles long in which the object apparently came to earth, no further search for the object is contemplated. In the commission of this initial report, no explanation has been developed for the brilliant illumination of the area, the object, itself, or the explosions in the wake of the object.

MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFI
ATTN: MR. [redacted]

SUBJECT: Proposed Reply to Mr. [redacted]

The April 13th, 1962 event noted by Mr. [redacted] was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force because of the unusual amount of public interest as well as the potential material. Depositions were taken from several well regarded individuals in the Tynntyle, Leamington, Silver City, Salt Lake, Eureka area of Utah. In an attempt was made to recover particles of the object, but correlation of testimony by various witnesses indicated their probable location to be in a virtually inaccessable valley to to 15 miles long in the Wasatch National Forest.

Detailed study of the depositions have lead to the conclusion that the object was a "bolide" that exploded as it neared the surface of the earth. Several of the depositions reported on big explosion followed by 20-30 smaller explosions likened to anti-aircraft fire.

Lt. Colonel Robert Friend and Dr. J. Allen Hynek conducted the investigation for the Air Force. Detailed reports are on file in this office.

UFO SIGHTING, LYNDYL, UTAH
19 April 1962

This is a recording concerning an unidentified flying object, taped on 19 April 1962 at 0800 hours at Lyndyl, Utah.

For the purposes of the recording, would you give your full name and address, Sir?
My name is [redacted], Lyndyl, Utah.
And could I have your age and occupation, Sir.
I am a merchant here in Lyndyl, I run a [redacted] and I have been here and I am sixty, 3rd of December, last.

With regard to the shape of the object you saw last evening, would you describe the shape, Sir.
The object, the way I saw it, looked more of a boat (?) form, maybe a little wider than round; but it seemed to all be on fire.
Did it have any definite shape?
I thought at first it was maybe sort of like a basketball.
About that size but I believe that it was smaller than that.

Then, with regard to the size, you would compare it to about the size of a basketball or smaller?
Or smaller.
How much smaller, the size of a baseball, or what?
Well, I believe it was a little larger than that, but due to the flame and that, I couldn't tell.

What was the color of the object?
It was a white heat; I believe a little blue in the white.
It looked like to me, I have seen burning metal, and that is what it looked like, more or less, burning metal. But it was so hot that it was just white heat.

And there was only the one object?
Just the one object.

Were there any discernible features?
Not that I could see.

Was there any tail or trail or vapor trail behind it such as you saw on aircraft of this kind?
There was a long trail of flame and heat. I imagine that would be about 500 feet and approximately that or a little longer. It could have been longer than that. And after that went out, it seemed to burn out, or it was going so fast that the object that was causing the heat passed through and left the flame. Then it went out and it was a smoke trail.

Here is the text from the document:

-2-

What first called your attention to the object?
I was tending the water on the garden. I had a flashlight on and instead of needing the flashlight, it became daylight. It became just as light as day from the object coming through the air.

This lighted up the whole surrounding area?
It did, the whole valley.

When you observed the object, at what angle in the sky was it coming?
It was traveling northwest from where I was standing. I was standing west of it.

When you first observed the object, was it directly overhead?
No, it was a little to the south, coming from the south. It was right in the moon. The moon was bright last night.

When it was approaching from the south, at what angle were you looking at it?
Oh, I imagine it was just about a 45 degrees angle, just about a square deal to it.

And as you watched this, it passed directly overhead?
It wasn't overhead. It was a little east of me and it passed going north, to the north from me. It was, I would say, 2-300 feet east of me when it went by.

Now, how high do you estimate the object was above you at this time?
From 3-500 feet.

Now, at the time of the disappearance, what would you judge the height of the elevation at that time?
I think it was around about 2-300 feet. I run east to get cleared of the house to see it and it had come into the north and had burnt out. It burnt out. By the time that I got out there it had burnt out.

You mentioned that it went into the Northwest. Would this be NNW, in other words, more north than west?
Yes.

How did the object disappear? Did it fade out gradually or did it disappear all at once?
It disappeared all at once. It was light and then it was dark. It just seemed to burn out.

And do you have any idea what time this was?
Quarter after eight, maybe twenty minutes after eight.

And at night time, what were the weather conditions? Was the sky clear?
The sky was clear and the stars shined and the moon was out.
Were there any clouds?
Very few, only a very light accumulus of clouds, very light, though.

And the location where you were in the yard, would you call this the center of town?
The north and of town.

I think that will be all the information we require for the report.

UFO SIGHTING LA VAN, UTAH
18 April 1962
18/03194

This investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2 taped at the Security and Law Enforcement Office, Hill AFB, Utah at 2320 hours on 19 April 1962 by Douglas M. Crouts, Chief Criminal Investigation Section, Security and Law Enforcement Division.

Captain Shields, for the purpose of this recording, would you give your name, rank, serial number and organization.

My name is Herman Gordon Shields, AL 22105641. I am a pilot with the 733 Troop Carrier Squadron, stationed Hill AFB.

With this regard to this object, would you describe the shape of the object.

Do you mean after we saw the light, the object itself after the light?

Describe the incident as far as the light and then the object.

I was flying a C-119 aircraft from the left seat. We were approximately two miles west of La Van, Utah flying at 8500 feet MSL. Our true air speed was a little less than 170 knots. We were making a right turn heading of about 060 degrees to 165 degrees. We were approximately 25 degrees at a bank on the aircraft and we had turned for about 30 degrees to a heading of about 093 or 100 degrees, somewhere in there, when it began to get very bright in the cockpit. The illumination was from above. It was built up slowly.

My first impression while the intensity was low was that it was another aircraft, of course, when the intensity increased this was ruled out automatically. The cockpit was illuminated from above. In the C-119 aircraft there is an instrument panel in the middle of the cockpit up in the right side. It was blanked out. The light source was coming from this area that was blanked out, in other words, straight behind this instrument panel because neither Lt Larson who was in the right seat nor I saw the source of the illumination. We continued in this turn. The light intensity increased until we could see objects as bright as day for a radius of five to ten miles from the aircraft. This would probably be a diameter of about twenty miles or so. Objects on the ground, on the hills around us, were clearly distinguishable. Colors were distinguishable. It was as bright as daylight. The intensity of the light diminished faster than it had increased. After the light had decreased in intensity we were still looking for the light source, and I noticed an object to my left between the wing and the lower part of the fuselage of the aircraft against the hills. By this time the light had decreased so that the object which I saw was dark. It was night again. And this object which I saw was illuminated.

It had a long slender appearance comparable to a cigarette in size. That is, the diameter with respect to the length of the object. The foro part, or the lower part of the object, was a very bright intense white, such as a magnesium fire. The second half, the aft section, was a clearly distinguishable yellow color. I would say the object was just about devided in half, the foro part being intensely white, the aft section having a more yellow color to it.
