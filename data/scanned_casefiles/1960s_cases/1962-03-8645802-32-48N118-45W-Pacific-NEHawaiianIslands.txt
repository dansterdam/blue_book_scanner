10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Light ball with trail about 5 times length. Observed from a ship by military personnel. Object sighted 5 to 5 moving W-E. Covered approx 20° of arc at an elevation of 30° in 2 sec. Flame burned out about 25° above horizon on heading of 160°. No sound. Differed from normal meteor sighting in almost horizontal trajectory, brilliance of flame, and nearness of object.

11. COMMENTS
Object has all characteristics of meteor sighting, brightness being attributed to means of meteor near horizontal trajectory does not rule out a meteor.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Light blue ball with trail about 5X length. Observed from a ship by military personnel. Object was sighted to the South and was moving from West to East. Observed approximately 20 degrees of arc are at an elevation of 30 degrees in 3 secs. Flame turned out about 25 degrees above the horizon on a heading of 160 degrees. No sound. Differed from normal meteor sighting in almost horizontal trajectory, brilliance of flame, and nearness of object.

EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: Astro (Meteor)
CONCLUSION:
Object has all characteristics of meteor sighting, brightness being attributed to the nearness of the meteor and horizontal trajectory does not rule out a meteor.
