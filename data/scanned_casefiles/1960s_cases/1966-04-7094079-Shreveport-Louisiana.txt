The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or documentation from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

(S) CASE DETERMINATION: TYPE V/C. AIR SITING, HANDLING, SPEED. 

1. This case 2000-2010C - Light conditions: Day, night, dawn, dusk. 

2. Exact location of observers: City on outskirts of home located in 8" central Shreveport, La.

3. Physical evidence: None

4. Weather: Observer's account - Black sky.

Official Wing direction & velocity at surface: 25 M/H/350 - Alt. 25,000' at 330/25 - DS 25 

Ceiling: None      Visibility: 15       Amount of cloud cover: None

Temperature: None                    Temperature gradient: 0-0Â° F 1500'

1. Check with the Shreveport police revealed that they do not use this type of light. An ambulance company advised that they have discontinued this light and had no other reports.

2. Captain Ruab, Jr., 1934#, a PBY controller from the Command Post was flying a routine training mission in a PBY on the 7th when he received a report from the crew that they had sighted an unknown object at 17,000 feet crossing their course. The object was described as a bright light, in excess of 2000-3000 mph, with no exhaust trail, and no visible means of propulsion. The object was observed visually for approximately 10-15 seconds before it disappeared from sight. Captain Ruab did not see the object himself.

3. The original report was made to the Investigating Officer at 17:00 hrs 7 Apr. The officer interviewed the individuals concerned and checked the area in the neighborhood, but could find no further evidence or witnesses. Neighbors were not interviewed as the observation was at night, and there was nothing further to be gained.

Investigator's analysis: It is possible that the object observed was some type of meteor or other natural phenomenon, as the description fits that of a bright light traveling at high speed with no visible means of propulsion. However, the high rate of speed and lack of an exhaust trail are not typical of meteors. Since there is no other physical evidence, and no other witnesses have come forward, a definite determination cannot be made.

The report is signed by an Investigating Officer and dated 11 April 1966.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and associated instructions. The diagram shows a curved horizon line and instructions for how to interpret it to determine the altitude and positioning of an observed object.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
