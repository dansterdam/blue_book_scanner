h. Remarks:

1. Check with the Shreveport police revealed that they do not use this type of siren. An ambulance company used to use it, but they have discontinued this type. He explained it as being an electrical siren. Sergeant Elkins, Shv. Police Department examined their records and found no police or ambulance calls near that neighborhood.

2. Captain Webb, USAF, a 2M Controller from the Command Post, was flying a T-33 in the pattern at Barksdale at the time and reports no unusual sightings and no traffic in the area such as ground haze with excellent visibility.

3. This report was received by the Investigating Officer at 1700 hrs, 2 April. The original report was made to the Shreveport Police Dept on the 2nd, relayed to the Bombing Command Post, then relayed to the Investigating Officer. The I.O. then contacted the town lead, re-asked the question on this work sheet, compared with the answers received at the C.P. (they use same work sheet), and found no outstanding discrepancies. With visual sighting was 16 yrs old, student, tel. 635-4770. The I.O. drove around the neighborhood between 2000-2030 hrs on 2 April, but did not interview any such occurrence. "Neighbors were not questioned." The girls truly feel they saw "it" as a UFO. Their reaction upon seeing "it" was to run away fast as they could. They both feel they saw it again at about 2330 hrs, but it was at a much higher altitude. The first time it was "right over the house".

The I.O. does not have any explanation. Base 'X' observer did not see anything, nor have there been any other reports.
