10. CONCLUSION
BALLOON

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Probably round object white, small similar to star of 2d magnitude steadily white light, no features. Observed at 70 deg elevation falling to 30 deg elevation. Motion included a "m" of 20 degrees amplitude.

COMMENTS: Duration and motion tend to rule out Satellites and a/c. Not in accord with Astro observation. Motion constant with balloon such as local WX balloon with light attached. "W" can be accounted for by shift in surface winds and mountainous terrain in and around Albuquerque. Object very dim. This is consistent with the small battery operated light that balloons carry.
