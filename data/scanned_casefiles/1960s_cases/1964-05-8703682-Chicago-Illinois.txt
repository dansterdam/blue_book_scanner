When he told me, however, that just before that he had been looking at the setting dials of his telescope, illuminating them with a red light, it seemed that we might have the explanation there, as you see I have indicated in my letter to him.

So, all in all, the fuzzy edges, the greenish tinge, the faintness of the object, the peculiar motion, and the fact that even looking at a red light just before adds up, it seems to me, to the likelihood that this was a subjective experience. Perhaps, he had been bending over and suddenly straightened up. Anyway, I don't think we should chalk this up to anything really out of the ordinary, and unless he comes back with a very sharp and cogent denial, I think we might well evaluate this as a subjective experience, possibly after-images caused by watching a red light.

I'm working on the Atlas, Mt. Vernon, and the _______ cases. I haven't been able to locate the Northwestern student as yet. One final thing in the case, it was he himself who brought up the suggestion that it might have been caused by the red light. Usually when the witness brings up a suggestion like that, it often means the he's pretty convinced himself that that is what it was.

Sincerely,

Mr. [redacted]
Chicago, Illinois

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is a rather belated reply to your letter of November 18, but that's the way it goes.

I tend to agree with you as to the inadequacy of the after-image interpretation. This was just a possibility, of course.

One thing occurred to me later on, and I suggest it only in order to put on the tablecloth possible interpretations, even though remote. Could possibly the celestial lights, which, through some known relation of birds eliminated by distant street lights, say mercury lights? I bring this up only because this turned out essentially to be the cause of the famous Lubbock lights which caused such a stir a number of years ago. I myself have seen birds dimly illuminated at night and the effect, I can assure you, is quite startling.

Let me know what you think about this possible interpretation. I do not offer it as an explanation but only in the sense of airing off all possible explanations, as I did in the matter of the after-image. Operating on the basis which prevails that we have a perfectly logical explanation our job is to see whether the facts jibe with remote, perfectly natural explanations. If in the long run they do not, then we must begin the search for other explanations - which might lead to a one-night atmospheric phenomenon, etc. I quite agree with you that there is no need to present to introduce extra-terrestrial evidence to explain your sighting.

Thanks again for the time you have taken with all this, and I hope to hear from you.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

CHICAGO 4, ILLINOIS                                                November 18, 1964

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Director,

Evanston, Illinois 60201

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I was honored and pleased to hear from you today in writing concerning the May 9th phenomenon we have discussed.

My particular reason for writing is because, as is often the case, a number of things occurred to me after we had spoken on the phone which I neglected to mention.

As a preliminary, I think we had established that the most striking elements of this phenomenon were the following:
1. Oscillating or pulsing; 2. attitude of cuspa oddly pointing as illustrated in my drawings. (You may wonder why this continues to impress me. May it just suffice to say the nature of it was profound and completely unique) 3. Such other things as path of motion, fuzzy outlines, color, etc.

I have never once considered this as an extra-terrestrial occurrence, not even at the moment I saw it; I was only aware that I had witnessed something extraordinary. May I stress that the appearance was bold and vivid and above all fear-inspiring.

I think I should tell you that I am regarded as a cynic and I tend to pooh-pooh myths, superstitions, dogmatic religious beliefs, etc., so that it takes a great deal to excite me, as did this matter - witness the fact that I immediately began making phone calls, sending telegrams and writing letters seeking some sort of corroboration or explanation.

Without hoping to enhance the mystery, or to perpetuate it, May I observe that it seems to me the after-image investigation fails in several significant particulars. May I with deference list them, as follows:

1. The appearance occurred almost a full minute after I had turned off my red flashlight; 2. My setting circles are are 10-inch diameters and can be read with a glance - not requiring concentrated light or squinting; 3. I have purposely let them oxidize so they would have a dull finish (cast aluminum); 4. Most important of all, I think, is the fact these objects raced into my view from the east traveling southwest as my gaze was fixed looking west; I first saw them out of the corner of my eye and had to turn, and then begin tracking them! This alone to me seems almost conclusively to

eliminate the after-image theory, as appealing as it is, since
my experience with after-image has been that the spurious
objects will always appear where one's eyes are first brought
to focus immediately after shifting them from the original
light source which the eye retains and transposes.

I think the main misunderstanding, leading to the
after-image theory, was that I had used the red flashlight and
then immediately looked up into the sky. If this were the
case I would have dismissed the whole matter without another
thought, since after-image is such a familiar experience to
all of us.

As I believe I remarked, I have tried repeatedly to
reenact or reproduce this effect, even on nights when the
sky has been of good transparency, and there has been nothing
of the sort observed.

Still in all, considering that after-image of red light
is almost invariably green, that crescent shapes assume the
exact contour of a flashlight shown on setting circles from
above (thereby being semicircles), the sky being intensely black,
and being an experienced observer, the conclusion is irresistible
and I think you can close the case on that note.

But damn that eerie oscillating! I list it as the
number one factor, please remember, and it stalling alone
would be sufficient to have launched all this inquiry.

Oh well. - I wish to thank you sincerely for allowing
me to impose on your valuable time. It is certainly a
mark of greatness common to men of your standing that you will
entertain even the eccentric, back yard astronomer such as I.

Very truly yours,

Unit for Investigation of UFOs
(Unidentified Flying Objects)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

I believe I am addressing this letter to the proper air base but do not know how to route it by organization. May I request it be directed to the unit responsible for investigating so-called UFOs.

I am similarly contacting the Chicago Adler Planetarium, Chicago Tribune Newspaper and Sky & Telescope Magazine, Cambridge, Mass.

Phenomenon Observed
Date: May 9, 1964; Time: 11:23 p.m. Central Daylight Saving Time; Place: South-western Chicago, Illinois; Visibility: Exceptional, cloudless.

Narration: Appearance of 3 large, light-green Crescents, observed for approx. 3 seconds traveling at high speed from east to west south of star constellation Leo, approx. 400 above horizon, disappearing abruptly after transit of approx. 1/4 of south-western sky.

Further details: Size: Each object approx. 1/4 diameter of moon; Brightness: Approx. 3d magnitude (dim but large); Oscillating in size & color; form, slightly nebulous. Objects held peculiar tight formation as shown in sketch attached.

Please note the following customary explanations have seemingly been eliminated: Auroral effects, presence of planet Venus, searchlights bouncing off clouds, aircraft, helicopters, advertising zeppelins, stray-light optical effects such as auto headlights, aircraft landing lights, etc.

May I respectfully request acknowledgment of receipt of this letter - I do not ask for explanations since I understand this is not customarily done.

14 November 1964

Chicago, Illinois

Dear Mr:

I have pondered quite a bit about the sighting you made last May 9, and I would very much like to find some reasonable explanation for it. I can appreciate that it must have been a very puzzling and even unnerving experience for you, but that would not help us to looking for a simple but, perhaps unusual explanation. I'm sure that neither you nor I would call for any extraterrestrial explanation will be everything else absolutely futile.

I did a great deal of checking with the Naval Research Laboratory, and in the form of a cosmic comment I am having been a subjective experience would be cleared away. I am embarrassed I was with several things you mentioned: your eyes were very dark-adapted, you had been looking over or at least not in a perfectly normal position (although you did not indicate this); the sky was intensely black; a fact which would have modified an exceedingly fine background for dark images. Perhaps, the thing that strikes me most of all is that green is the usual after-image color after a person has been looking at a red light.

I would like to give consideration to the following working hypothesis. I admit, of course, that it is only a hypothesis, but I should like your comments. You were watching the sky intensely black and your eyes were dark-adapted, and I suspect that what you saw was a residual after-image of something you had been looking at, perhaps a red light. Alternatively, staring up and suddenly looking up would, I believe, be conducive to seeing such an after-image.

Now I admit that this is only a slim hypothesis, and it may not fit the facts as only you can know them. I do believe it could fit the facts as you told me, as I would point out then, the present very meager detail in favor of this idea. Now why there should have been three crescents rather than one I will admit is very difficult to explain. As I say, this hypothesis may not hold water at all, but I will take no harm in commenting on it.

I do know, however, that I have had after-images in certain circumstances which I would have nearly more were tangible objects, and, as you know, after-images take the form of, the last object a person had been creating. That means when you were watching were certainly curved and shiny enough to reflect the red light you were using.


- page 13 -

I think it was extremely honest and conscientious of you to have mentioned the red light. It indicates to me that you yourself are examining all possibilities and that you will accept a normal but unusual evaluation as a probable cause rather than to deliberately cover up any facts in favor of perpetrating a mystery. You would be surprised, however, how many people are just that way. They love a good sensational story and occasionally or unconsciously hold back some little item which might well be the clue to the entire case.

Another thing about after-images is that the more you try to follow them with your eye, the faster they seem to scoot away, and, indeed, they have very much the same motion that you describe, across the field and in radial velocity. Well, I appreciate your comments, I think, both because you had an unusual experience and a vivid one. I wonder whether you have tried or would consider trying to repeat the actions of that night as closely as possible, noting, if you can, the same after-images you saw that night up as well against a background of a light-appearing sky.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
