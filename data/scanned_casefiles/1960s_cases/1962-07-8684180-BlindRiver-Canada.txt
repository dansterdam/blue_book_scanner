You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

(Continuing with handwritten text)
Car on return to our cabin we noticed this unusual visible light, rather low in the sky. The sun had gone down a few minutes before. We noted that at times it looked elongated and/or unnatural that it appeared as though it were tied (someone would observe the action of a kite). We continued it to the next in our cabin and they observed it too.

We played cards for a while and then went out to look at it again and it had moved far to the night. We remarked that it might be the new tel-star satellite because of the changing colors and twisting appearance, along with an occasional jerk to the west or west path.

Dear B50 -

Well I've been enjoying
a fine vacation, my time. A lucky
much needed rest, although I must

The image appears to be a handwritten document page. However, due to the handwriting style and image quality, much of the text is difficult to read with complete certainty. Some words and phrases are partially legible, but a full transcription would require significant interpretation. I can see that the document mentions "Canada" in one line, but beyond that, I cannot confidently reproduce the full text without risking inaccuracy.

[The rest of the text is largely illegible due to handwritten script that is difficult to decipher. While some words and fragments are visible, the full text cannot be reliably transcribed.]


- page 5 -

The text is partially legible. I can make out some words and phrases, but many parts are difficult to read clearly. Here's what I can discern:

"TIME" is clearly visible in the middle of the page.

Some other partially readable words and fragments include:
- "on top"
- "think"
- "could"

However, due to the handwritten nature of the document and the image quality, much of the text is illegible or only partially readable. A significant portion of the page appears to be a handwritten note with cursive script that is challenging to transcribe accurately.

Dear Mr.

Reference your recent letter regarding
Echo satellite.

The reflection of the sun is the only
reason you can see Echo as you see a star.

I have inclosed the Department of Defense
Press Release which pertains to aerial
phenomena sightings by two of America's space
men.

Sincerely,

Mr. L. Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs;
I want to let you know of our year & the satellite
last night about 11:10 PM. just as it was going between
first and second stars you the different handle
x's repeat star net you could see 8 9th.

PATH ECHO SATELLITE JULY 18TH

PATH ECHO SATELLITE JULY 19TH
11:16 PM

learned to turn a little to the
left here on go more toward the north kind of would
and then came down between the two stone way to
the east.

one question entered my mind and that was what was it
with like a star? Does the sunlight shine on it what?
quite trying to establish its similarity to the stars,
another thing I would like to see in color is the
picture then, reporter and shepherd would take on
their flight, would like to know if you know
please then two or more hours.
Kindly yours, truly,

B.3 matter things I don't quite understand on night changes etc course I am time to time.

Quite sure within my observation will be of my help to you as not on your probably help trouble yourself with your tracking.

So it had made most data up. It is surprising how little I look at the sky.

Signal got out in time to locate it just before it went between the two stars on the dipper handle tonight I was more adept knowing about where to look & caught it further back toward the west but it was more cloudy tonight. The dipper stars were visible but fading toward the & out the clouds obscured it completely for a short time then it was hard to follow.

Here is the text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten note: more colorful here]

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
About again as large as the evening star.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
all of it.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
no

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
A star or glowing light is the best explanation, except that at times it seemed to become elongated as though the shield of it would turn and then one would see part of its width being but they the same light, perhaps the head remained light. This elongation was quite intense if just as one first saw it. The changing colors were more intense as one looked at it.
