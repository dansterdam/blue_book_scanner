Dear [redacted],

Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter of 25 April 1966. Your photo camera failed analysis personally, here at Wright-Patterson AFB. Their only comment was that there was no discernible object that could be identified on the photograph and that the light colored areas on the photograph could have been caused by sun flare.

Since you stated in your letter that we may keep the photo, we are placing it in the case files with your report. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

VICTOR GUTTANELLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Dear Major Quintanella,

After trying in vain to find an explanation to this photograph I am sending a print of the slide to you. I hope you will be able to explain it as I am a member of the Professional Photographers of America and the National Press Photographers Association, I was recently employed as an intelligence analyst. 

DATA: Object was flying west to east, camera was looking east-south-east, as object was going from right to left in the frame, and was photographed after it reached the far left side of frame. It was quite high flying, fast, and made no con trails. No color. The naked eye. The man was behind me. This is not a double exposure. You may keep this print if you like.

Films: Kodachrome Type F 35mm 
Filter: Daylight (color correction)
Lens: (Kodak Pony 1/4.5 camera) 
Dates: June 5, 1960
Time: 1:55 p.m.
Place: Corner of Columbia and Pearl st.,Union City, Indiana.

I personally have given up trying to explain the pattern that developed on the film and hope you can help me.

Thank you.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a landscape, possibly a rural or open area. The photograph is grainy and appears to be a low-quality image, likely from an old document or report.

UNION CITY, INDIANA
7 JUNE 1960

OBJECT: The object was observed from 2115 to 2135 hours.

DESCRIPTION: The object was first observed at approximately 2115 hours. It appeared to be a bright white light which seemed to pulse or flicker at irregular intervals. The light appeared to be approximately 2 to 3 times as bright as a star. The object moved in an erratic manner, first moving in a northerly direction, then in a westerly direction, and then in a southerly direction. The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes before disappearing.

INVESTIGATION: The investigator interviewed the witness, a male adult, who stated that he was outside his home when he observed the object. The witness was able to provide a detailed description of the object and its movements. The investigator was unable to identify the object.

CONCLUSIONS: The investigator was unable to determine the identity of the object observed. The case remains UNIDENTIFIED.
