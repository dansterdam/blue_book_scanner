Dear [redacted]

Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter of 25 April 1966.
Your photo and camera data was sent to photo analyst personnel, here
at Wright-Patterson AFB. Their only comments were that there was
no discernible object that could be identified on the photograph and
that the light colored areas on the photograph could have been caused
by sun flare.

Since you stated in your letter that we may keep the photo, we are
placing it in the case file with your report. Thank you for reporting
your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[signature]

PHOTO JOURNALISM

Major Hector Quintanella Jr.
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanella,

After trying in vain to find an explanation to this photograph I am sending a print of the slide to you. I hope you will be able to explain it to me.

I am a member of the Professional Photographers of America and the National Press Photographers Association. I was recently employed by the local news paper for Ohio.

DATA:Object was flying west to east, camera was looking east-southeast, so object was going from right to left in the fram, and was photographed after it reached the far left side of fram. It was quiet, high flying, fast, and made no contrail, but of course the pattern that appears around it was not there to the naked eye. The sun was behind me. This is not a double exposure. You may keep this print if you like.

Film: Kodacolor Type F 35mm
Filter: Daylight ( color correction )
(Kodak Pony 1/1) Camera
Date: June 6, 1960
Time: 7:55 P.M.
Place: Corner of Columbia and Pearl st., Union City, Indiana.

I personally have given up trying to explain the pattern that developed on the film and hope you can help me.

Thank you,
