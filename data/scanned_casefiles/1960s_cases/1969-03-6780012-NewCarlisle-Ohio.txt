27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

1) Lives in a valley.

2) 5 yrs. ago saw a brilliant white object "like a pin-wheel" and spun very fast.

3) 4 yrs. ago one night saw an "orange boomerang" going back and forth from one side of the moon to the other respectively. It "hummed" and the blinded out of reappearing again.

4) 13 mo. ago saw a white object in the sky. It was "transparent".

5) Has been seeing a white pinpoint of light off on the horizon at various times daily, recent morning and evenings. Thinks it might be a "barn light".
