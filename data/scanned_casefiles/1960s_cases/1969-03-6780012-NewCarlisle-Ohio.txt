INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

(1) 3 yrs. ago saw brilliant white object "like a pin-wheel racing across the sky" very fast.

(2) 4 yrs. ago saw a light in the sky approaching from a distance. As it came closer it spread out and looked like a luminous boomerang. The light was so bright that it hurt the eyes to look at it.

(3) 10 mo. ago saw a white object in the sky. It was "translucent" and seemed to move in a jerky motion.

(4) Has been convinced that a white pinpoint of light off and on during the evening. Thinks it might be a "barn light".

The image appears to contain a compass rose diagram and two sketches depicting landscape views. The compass rose diagram shows the cardinal directions and is accompanied by instructions on how to use it to indicate the position of a phenomenon. The two sketches depict landscape views, one showing a distant horizon and the other showing a closer view of a landscape feature.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

In the sketch below, place an "x" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "o" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the "x" and "o" with a line to approximate the course of the observed object.
