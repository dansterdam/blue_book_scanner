Headquarters USAF

Washington 25, D. C.

Attention: SAFOI

Dear Sirs:

Captain Moore of the USAF New Haven Office has indicated that the writer should contact you regarding the visual sighting of a possible satellite burn-out. The circumstances were as follows:

At 5:30 to 5:45 a. m. on December the 14th, the writer was proceeding west on the Connecticut Turnpike, between Bridgeport and Stamford, Connecticut. At that time, he noticed a very rapidly moving red object crossing the sky dead ahead, in a West-Northwest to Northeasterly direction. This object appeared in the lefthand corner of the upper part of the windshield of the car, and proceeded across the front of the car which was traveling in an approximate westerly direction.

Initially, the object glowed bright red and left a trail, then suddenly at approximately 2 o'clock, a visible intensity change was noted, similar to a flash bulb going off, then the trail changed to white, concluding above the northern horizon, at approximately 3 o'clock.

The object appeared to be much closer than a normally viewed meteor or "falling star." In addition, the intensity was considerably brighter than the writer had ever observed for falling stars, and of course the color progression from the red to white was also not similar to past observances of "falling stars."

The writer would be pleased to supply any additional information he might, should it be available, and believes he could actually pin-point the location of the automobile to within one mile if necessary.

Very truly yours,

CFB/kf

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round object size of much ball. Blue and red-
ong (witness) blue and white-another witness.
One witness stated object left a trail at
least 10 miles long.

11. COMMENTS
It was not considered unusual for the wit-
ness to indicate but the object had
landed. Brightness of these meteors leaves
us with the impression that they are not
closer than they really are. This is due
to the judgment of distance being estimated
from the brightness or related to other
meteors. Object of this sighting displayed
salient characteristics of a meteor of the
fireball class.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical Meteor
☐ Other:
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown
