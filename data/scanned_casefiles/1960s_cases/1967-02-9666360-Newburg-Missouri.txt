Text found in the document:

Dear sir,

About 10:30 pm May 3, 1967 a UFO was seen by myself and a number of other witnesses near a highway in Newburg, Missouri. The object was observed for about 15 minutes and was described as round, about 80 feet in diameter, and having a bright light in the center which was surrounded by other smaller bright lights. The object was hovering at a low level above the trees and made no sound. At one point the central light went dark and the object seemed to be pulsing dimly. When it took off, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

I would appreciate it if you could look into this incident and let me know if you have any information on it. Please keep me informed of any further developments.

Sincerely,
David Eckert
