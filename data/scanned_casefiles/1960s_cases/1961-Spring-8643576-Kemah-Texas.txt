Dear Mrs.

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified
flying objects.

I am enclosing a copy of FFD Form 164 which is used for
reporting an unidentified flying object to the Air Force. If
you will complete the form as fully as possible and return it
to this office, we will evaluate your report, and you will be
informed of the results.

The material that you found in your yard was probably
"chaff". This material is dropped from aircraft for the purpose of training radar operators in the event of enemy attack.
I am enclosing an information sheet on this subject which will
help you gain a better insight into the cause of such operations.

I am also enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book,
the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects, for your
perusal. I hope this report will be of interest to you.

So I sent the sample that they had asked for to Ellington and waited to see what they had to say. All I received from Ellington, A.F.B. was a thank you for the sample, but with no other information. I am rather sure they would have some record that would give you the exact date that we saw the object, as it was the same day that we had reported the other stuff.

Mrs. /SAFOICC/72842/9 Sep 65

SEP -9 1965

Dear Mrs.

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you could not identify in 1961.

The object or phenomena which you observed is similar to an observation of a sun dog. If the object appeared stationary or seemed to float around in the same general location for a considerable portion of the 4-5 minutes during which it was observed, and the disappearance over the horizon was a matter of seconds, then the object was in all probability a sun dog.

Disappearance in this manner could be attributed to a dissipation of the ice layer reflecting the sun. Sun dogs appear between twenty and twenty-five degrees from the sun. Your report places the object at that approximate position.

Thank you for reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   16   JULY   1965
                                                    Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

ON THE DAY WE SAW THIS OBJECT, A ROOMER AT MY HOUSE HAD GONE TO THE GROCERY STORE, ON OUR WAY BACK, ABOUT 4 BLOCK FROM OUR HOUSE, WE NOTICED LONG STRIPS OF SOMETHING COMING FROM OUT OF THE AIR JUST AS HIGH AS ONE COULD SEE. THESE LONG STRIPS WERE SOME A BLOCK LONG THAT WERE HANGING ALL OVER THE TREES. ELECTRIC LINES LOOKED LIKE SPIDER WEB ACROSS TO WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. AT A LOSS TO WHAT THEY WERE CHAFE OR ELLINGTON AIR FORCE BASE AND WE ALL TOLD US, WE STOPPED AT A PHONE BOOTH, CAME DOWN, THEN WE DECIDED TO CHECK ELLINGTON AIR FORCE BASE. THEY IMMEDIATELY SAID SEVERAL JETS OVER KEMAH, AND TOLD US BY PHONE TO GET THEM A SAMPLE OF THIS, WHAT I DID. WE HAD GATHERED QUITE A BIT. THEN WE COME ON HOME. THEN AFTER HERE WHILE I WENT OUT IN THE YARD TO HANG OUT SOME CLOTHES ON THE LINE, I WALKED UP AND SAW A LONG STRING OF THAT SAME STUFF COMING DOWN. I CALLED TO THE MAN TO COME OUT AND GET IT FOR ME SO I COULD PUT IT WITH ELLINGTON A.F. SAMPLE WHEN THE MAN GOT TO WHERE I WAS HE LOOKED UP AND SAID TO ME WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT. THEN WE SAW IT, AND JUST STOOD THERE AND WATCHED IT A WHILE. LEAVE WAS ABOUT A BLOCK OVER A BODY ABOUT IT BUT THEY JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. WE HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE. I EVEN TOLD IT ON THE KTRH RADIO NIGHT WHAT DO YOU THINK. PERHAPS PEOPLE CAN'T AND WON'T BELIEVE IT, BUT I BELIEVE WHAT I SAW. WHAT BRAND SIDE DRINKS SO I JUST CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT WE SAW.

ATTN OF: TDESW
SUBJECT: UFO Sightings, Kemah, Texas, Spring 1961

TO: Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs ■)
Wash D C 20330

30 AUG 1965

1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Mrs ■ of two objects which she observed in the spring of 1961. Please apologize for the delay in replying.

2. The observation of the white spider-like material was in all probability spider webs from migratory or ballooning spiders. For an account of similar incidents it is suggested that she read "The World of Flying Saucers" by Doctor Boyn and Menzel. There are quite a few reports of these observations on file at Project Blue Book.

3. We have screened the files at Project Blue Book and apparently her report was not forwarded to us from Ellington AFB since there were no reports from Kemah, Texas for the spring of 1961.

4. The object or phenomena which she observed is similar to an observation of a sun dog with the exception of the motions and disappearance over the horizon. If the object appeared stationary, or appeared to float around in the same general location, for a considerable portion of the 4-5 minutes during which it was observed and the disappearance over the horizon was a matter of seconds, then the object was in all probability a sun dog. Disappearance in this manner could be attributed to different layers of the sun reflecting the sun. Sun dogs appear between twenty and twenty-five degrees from the sun. Her report places this object at that approximate position again. If the motion continues with the above, then her sighting can be evaluated as a sun dog. If not, we are at a loss to explain the object/phenomena which she observed.

Dear Lady:

I heard one day that you were asked if you believed the UFO were from outer space, and you said no.

If you really believe this then I am wondering if you could tell me who owns or who makes these like the one two of you now sitting in our book guard. First let me tell you about it. it was a beautiful sunny day about two years ago. I was coming back from Moody Shopping about ten A.M. I noticed while


- page 15 -

Here is the text from the document:

driving long white cotton, or
spider web, like strings coming
out of the sky. they were
coming down hanging all
over some thing, telephone, &
electrical lines, trees and some
thing was full of them we
could see them coming down
swimming around. Some pretty
a half mile long. I stopped
at neighbors and saw one
was watching this. finally I
called Ellington Air Forte
base near Houston. they told
me to get them a sample list
in which, I duly and mailed
to them. they sent many
many fotos over our John
to town as I called them


- page 16 -

I do not know what they found out, but I sent the sample and was thanked by letter, post.

Then about 2:30 P.M. I had just looking and was at home. I went out to the back yard and as I started to hang a piece of cloth on the line.

I saw a large string of this asbestos like stuff coming down near me. I wanted a place to keep and examine closely, so, I called a man from way in my house, he come out and I told him to gather it up for me as it come down, and just at that time he said to me look what is that. Likely, right over


- page 17 -

Here is the text from the document:

Our Hardly was a Round machine as first seen it was, it was about 50 ft while the most beautiful thing I ever saw it gleamed like a diamond it looked like two Round disks with a opening or windows around the center it looked like it was pumping in a accordion fashion and even time it pumped. it shaped like sparkles was coming out that looked brightly like the sparkles of a large diamond tinkles, sun, or light, there was no noise, not a sound, yet it was just over the top of the trees, we both stood and watched it until it went out of sight it didn't seem to be going fast


- page 18 -

it was just moving along with
a up women mothing- one
time it would go to gather in
the middle in a pump fashion
that beautiful diamond like
sparkles would short out around
the machine, it was the bright
aluminum I was ever seen
like the most shiny fait in sun
light. we were not comparing that
all was thing, we did see it as
I said it was very near the
ground one a very beautiful day
and was not going fast. and
made no noise, it any one
might or ours such thing
I surely would like to know
that it, because time time
I step out at night in my
yard I am wondering if one
could be setting there because
it was for Cleveland here at


- page 19 -

Here is the text from the document:

I was out that early one about this they look at us like we may be crazy, or, at least doubt what we saw. And another thing rather us no drink- and I want us saw- we Really saw it.

I must say it was not a scary thing, to look at, do the Contrary it was one of the most beautiful things I saw saw it were first Banding along - beautiful Place, could you Place tell me what it was that was a Earth made machine was it a Earth made machine if it was I think it will but getting by knowing it, excuse my writing. and hope you can read it. I'm thinking ya. for long information Regarding this.
