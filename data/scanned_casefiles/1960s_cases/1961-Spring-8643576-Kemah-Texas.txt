Dear Mrs.

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects. 

We are enclosing a copy of AF Form 164 which is used for your report on unidentified flying objects. As soon as possible and return it to this office, we will evaluate your report, and you will be informed of the results.

The material that you found in your yard was probably "chaff" material. This is dropped from aircraft as an electronic countermeasure. I am enclosing an information sheet on this subject which will help you gain a better insight into the cause of such operations.

I am also enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects, for your perusal. I hope this report will be of interest to you.

Mrs.: [redacted]
SAFoICo/731b/9 Sep 65 

SEP - 9 1965

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you could not identify in 1961. The object which you observed is similar to an observation of a metallic, stationary or oscillating object reported from other areas. The characteristics of the object observed and the disappearance over the horizon was a matter of concern. However, in many instances, the probability is that such objects may be caused by a variety of natural or man-made phenomena. The reflection of the sun's rays on the ice layers reflecting the sun's image is one of the possibilities. Such objects may appear between the ice layers reflecting the sun.

Thank you for reporting your observation.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 JULY 1961
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
OBJECT BEAMED EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT INTO OUR HOUSE THRU OUR WINDOW. WE CALLED TO SOME NEIGHBORS WHO NOTICED MOVEMENT OF SOMETHING HANGING IN AIR OUTSIDE. NEIGHBOR CAME OUT WITH CAMERA BUT OBJECT HAD GONE BY THE TIME HE GOT OUT. WE WATCHED IT AGAIN LATER THAT NIGHT. IT APPEARS THAT OBJECT MADE TWO PASSES, AS IF TO RECONNOITRE OUR HOUSE, THEN LEFT. ON EACH PASS IT BEAMED A BRIGHT LIGHT INTO OUR HOUSE. THEY WERE AMAZED AT THIS DISPLAY. ON THE SECOND SIGHTING THAT NIGHT, IT SEEMED TO HOVER, THEN TOOK OFF AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED TOWARD THE NORTH SKY. I CANNOT SAY FOR SURE WHAT IT WAS, BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, IT ACTED LIKE IT WAS CURIOUS ABOUT OUR HOUSE AND BARGED IN ON US TWICE WITH A BRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT. I AM STILL PUZZLED
ABOUT IT AFTER ALL THIS TIME. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT SEEMED QUITE INTELLIGENT AND PURPOSEFUL IN ITS ACTIONS. WE DID SEE IT ALMOST EVERYNIGHT FOR A WEEK OR TWO, THEN IT WAS GONE. I DID NOT GET ANY GOOD PHOTOS, THOUGH MY NEIGHBOR TRIED.

1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Mrs. —— of Kemah, Texas, Spring 1961. Please accept our apologies for the delay in replying.

2. The object she observed in the spring of 1961 was described as a spider-like material was in a probability spider webs from migratory or ballooning spiders. For an actual description, the observer read that these webs were quite similar to those observed by Boyd and Menzel. There are quite a few reports of these observations on file at Project Blue Book.

3. We have screened the files at Project Blue Book and apparently her report was not forwarded to us for evaluation. This letter is our findings.

4. The object or phenomena which she observed is similar to an observation of the motion and disappearance over the horizon. If the object appeared stationary, disappeared to reappear again, if the general location, size, and direction was the same, then the disappearance over the horizon was a matter of seconds, then the object was all probability a sun dog. Sun dogs appear between twenty and twenty-five degrees from the sun; reports show this phenomenon quite often.

5. In summary, the observer's description indicates the observed object to be a sun dog, evaluated as a sun dog, if not, we are unable to explain the object/phenomena which she observed.

1. I was contacted on the radio and told that there was a light that was seen in the sky a very brilliant light. I investigated this along with some other people in Kemah, Texas.

2. I realiy [sic] believe this scene a wonderful mystery dept. I am wondering if you could direct me.

If this really was any kind of craft, I wonder who was in it and what they were doing here on earth. Can you give me any information? I would appreciate it very much.

I had a beautiful memory of this, about two years ago. I lived 5 mile Nw. of Kemah, Texas. I am a commercial artist, and can draw what I saw, and am attaching a drawing to this letter. I wonder if you could direct me to the proper place.

This handwritten report describes the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Kemah, Texas. It mentions a "round machine" that was observed for some time. The report includes details about the object's appearance and movements, as well as the observer's impressions and reactions. The text appears to be a detailed account of the UFO sighting.

At this time it is night just moving along with a ship's narrow moterry lass under my light of ground to the Genere of Houston, Texas; where I met a gentleman who said something to me about a "bright light" that kept around for a time blinking and moving slowly toward the north, the intensity of light was so very bright, could see thru machine if very close between. It appeared to be at a great altitude. After remaining stationary for a while it departed to the north at high speed, and I could not follow it any longer. This light behaved very similar to a bright star, yet it was not a star. Many strange things have occurred in this area and I have not been much excited about them, but feel it is my duty to report this unusual thing, as I step outside of my own usually skeptical tendency to draw conclusions, and try to report the matter accurately.

OCR output:

This was the only one about this time and at any rate we may have
been quite busy, as we had doubt that you know as readily what
else was going on around them. We gave very good descriptive
data, and read documents really said that we could not
have really seen it ven if some of the most beautiful
things I have ever seen. Nothing was close except the most
beautiful soaring thing I remember ever seeing, to move and
disappearance along the most beautiful soaring
movements I have ever seen so fast.

Please, could it be just some kind of normal military operation going on? I tried to avoid
that so did not get a good look at it not a circle mile machine
but not quite a triangle-and I have had quite a lot of time
my waiting-and hope on some good clarification.
