The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a sighting of a luminous object in the sky near Safi, Morocco in 1966. The text on the page provides details about the object, including its spherical shape with what appeared to be jet engines, its rapid movement at a very high speed, and the observations of several eyewitnesses. The text also mentions that the object was heading towards the south and that a luminous non-identified object was observed passing overhead. The report is classified as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom.
