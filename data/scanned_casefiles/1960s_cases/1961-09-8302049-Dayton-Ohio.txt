10. BRIEF SUMMARY
Bright obj varying in color fm red to orange to blue observed on succeeding nights for several hours in the Northeast. Also gave appearance of changing size.

11. COMMENTS
All indications point to observation of star Capella, 1 of brightest stars in northern hemisphere. Apparent color and brightness change was due to scintillation. Earth's atmosphere has air currents at varying temperatures at the boundary between 2 currents there is a mixing of air masses which give rise to irregular motions in a beam of light coming fm a star. Fact that witness observed obj for long periods and on subsequent nights substantiates observation of a star.
