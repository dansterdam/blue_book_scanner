The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form or record from Project 10073, which seems to be a project related to UFO observations. The text in the image describes the location, time, and details of an observation, including a "Probable Astro (CAPRI.A)" and a "Probable Aircraft". The brief summary and analysis indicates that a "Viau" UFO was observed at 2000 hours at about 150° elevation in the northeast, and at 2115 hours, a "Viau" UFO was observed again, this time at about 50° elevation. The record also mentions other UPO's (sic) appearing to be of a stellar magnitude of +0.2±.
