AFR 80-17(C1)

10-14-69    North North East    8:00PM. to 9:57PM.

First Saw bright, star like, UFOs, North North East of our House. My 13yr old Son saw't too, Through field glasses, to me it seemed to change colors, from red, to white, to orange, to green. This very gradually moved, as I show set before, from 1 to 2 in about 15 min.

In all this time, there were about 6 UFO's moving back to forth. From N.E. to N.W. back. Don't know if they were the same ones or not, But would see at least 20 or 3 at the same time, besides the big one. They were usually red, med. speed. Some were blinking, some not. No sound. One of the UFO's moved E to W, then E.W. 

I blinked out "Friend" in Morse Code, with the porch light. This seemed to cause more activity, but don't know if they blinked in response. TV static. Dogs barked in the distance.

10:10PM, N.N.E. from W to E. Red blinking UFO, then white, then reds. Very low in trees.

10:25PM, N.N.E. an other red blinking UFO. Moving from E. to W. in the North. Some at saw this.

From time to time My husband & our 4 children have watched these.

I had not sent this saucer, because of illness in family. I didn't have time to finish till now.

Still having occasional sightings, but none outstanding.

AFR 80-17(C1)

GA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON, WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "*" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
