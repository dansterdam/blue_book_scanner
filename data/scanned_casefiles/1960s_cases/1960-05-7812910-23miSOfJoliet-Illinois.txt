INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS OF ONE M

at 0315Z hours, 1 June 1960, set out to obtain
a telescopic picture of the moon. He observed the planet Jupiter to be
very bright and for approximately 45 minutes he studied Jupiter with the
aid of a 120X 4 1/2" reflector telescope. At no time did
observe in the heavens an unidentified flying object; however, he did feel
that to the casual observer, the planet Jupiter could present an optical
illusion, especially when viewed without an appreciable optical aid. The
period of observation was discontinued after 0400Z hours, 1 June 1960,
due to cloud forms obstructing the view.

Subject: Planet Jupiter

Reference: Encyclopedia Americana Vol 16, 1956 Edition and Encyclopedia Britannica Vol 13, 1956 Edition.

Description: With the exception of the Sun, Jupiter is the largest member of the Solar System. Since its orbit lies outside that of the earth, it is possible to be observed above the horizon of the earth all night long.

Jupiter's shape is elliptical with a polar flattening of about 1/15 its diameter. The albedo of Jupiter is 44% which means a high reflectivity of incident light making it often the brightest object in the skies. The predominate color is yellow with several nearly parallel bands of varying widths, which are at times red-brown, neutral grey or even bluish in color. A slight darkening of the limb farthest from the sun can be observed.

Just a Planet

Braidwood Sees Object in Sky

Braidwood was kept awake Tuesday night as residents peered at a bright object in the southern sky.

An AF jet interceptor from Truax Field, Milwaukee, Wis., was sent to the area early today to investigate.

It was finally determined that two celestial bodies were putting on their brightest show of the year.

William Gomora, Reed Township Supervisor and a member of the Will County Civil Defense Committee, noticed the bright object in the southern sky first at about 10 P.M. Tuesday. He watched it rise until about 3 A.M. today.

Gomora called Robert McFadden, Will County Civil Defense Director, who notified the FAA and the Air Defense Office in Chicago. A call was put through to Truax Field which telephone Gomora when the jet neared the Braidwood area. Gomora was on the telephone almost 2 hours while the plane circled.

Robert F. Price, head of the Physics and Astronomy Departments at Joliet Junior College, when called early today regarding the mysterious "flying object", said apparently either Jupiter or Saturn was putting on a bright show. He said Jupiter was the brighter of the two.

UFO REPORT                                                   6 January 1967

TIME/PLACE OF SIGHTING: Letter part of April on early part of May 1960 (exact date unknown) at about 1:06 p.m. Local time. Object viewed from shop class window at the Walled Lake Senior High School, Walled Lake, Mich.

DURATION: 2 to 3 minutes

NUMBER OF OBSERVERS: One

TYPE OF OBSERVER: 11th grade high school student

NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

VIEWING RELIABILITY: 

SHAPE: Object resembled a sewing needle

DIMENSIONS: About the size of a sewing needle held at arm's length

COLOR: Silver metallic (shiny)

SOUND: No sound heard

ALTITUDE: Estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 ft.

SPEED: Object remained stationary throughout observation.

TITLE: I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could go on to my 6th hour class. I walked out into the shop work area to get my books out of my locker and decided to wait by the work bench until the bell rang. I looked out the large window on the north end side of the shop to see what the weather was like and found the sky to be clear with only a few large white fluffy clouds slowly moving across the sky. I spotted what first appeared to be a crack in the window glass but after a closer look I found that it was not a crack but another object some distance away.

It was stationary in the sky maintaining a horizontal position which did not change throughout the observation nor did the object move during the entire sighting. I moved from where I was standing to other areas near the window and the object maintained it's same relative position. I was unable to go outside via the shop door as it was kept locked at the time. Why I did not call this to someone else's attention I do not know except for the possible reason that I did not know what I was looking at and I did not want to leave the area to get someone in case the object did move away.

I leave the area in which I was in a parking a position of this time. I observed a large fluffy white cloud which was moving at such an angle that I knew that it would soon block my view of the object and I was hoping the object would do something before this happened. Unfortunately the cloud moved in between myself and the object and the object was lost from my view. Seconds later the school bell rang. I stayed 7 August long as I could. I viewed without taking a chance of being late for my next class. I have not drawn any conclusions as to what this object was except it was unlike any object I had seen before or since at the time of my sighting.

SAF-OICG/Mrs [redacted] 09/T9079/3 Feb 67

FEB -6 1967

Dear [redacted]

Reference your letter of January 5, 1967 reporting a 1960 unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

At such a late date, a comprehensive study would be extremely difficult. Since records of air activity are normally destroyed several months after their use, there would be practically no records to check in an attempt to determine the actual stimulus. The information will be filed and added to the present data base.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

(UFO REPORT CONT.)                                                Page 2

in fact interested in UFO reports and had read several books and articles on the subject. Since 1960 I have read as much as I could on the subject both pro and con. I have not yet come to any one conclusion on the subject but I do feel that a more thorough and complete investigation could and should be made on the subject. After reading the January 1967 edition of Science & Mechanics which contained two articles on UFO Investigation and UFO reports I decided to send a copy of this report to the Air Force's "Project Blue Book" and the official organization "NICAP".

If either organization should feel it necessary to send one of their investigators to my home for a personal interview I would be more than happy to answer any and all of their questions to the best of my ability. I am presently enrolled at a trade college in the Detroit area but can be reached at home. My address is as follows:

I know there is nothing very unusual about my report in relation to others you have received, but I thank you for your time in reading this report.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] 6 January 1967

Dear [redacted],

Reference your letter of 6 January 1967 reporting a 1960 Unidentified Flying Object(UFO) Observation. At such a late date, a comprehensive study would be extremely difficult. Since records of air activity are normally destroyed several months after their use, there would be practically no records to check in an attempt to determine the actual stimulus. The information will be filed and added to the present data base.

Thank you.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

in fact interested in UFO reports and had read several books and articles on
the subject. Since 1960 I have read as much as I could on the subject both
pro and con. I have not yet come to any one conclusion on the subject but
I do feel that a more thorough and complete investigation could and should
be made on the subject. After reading the January 1967 edition of Science
& Mechanics which contained two articles on UFO Investigation and UFO reports
I decided to send a copy of this report to the Air Force's "Project Blue
Book" and the unofficial organization "NICAP". If either organization
should feel it necessary to send one of their investigators to my home for
a personal interview I would be more than happy to answer any and all of
these questions to the best of my ability. I am presently enrolled at a
barber college in the Detroit area but can be reached at home. My address
is as follows:

Dear [redacted]:

A check of the files for 19 May 1960, reveals one TITAN missile was fired downrange at 21:02. Normal source would possibly bring it within sight of WSMR at its extended altitude. Unfortunately, we have no information on course altitudes.

There was another shot on the same day that presents a possibility: A missile was fired at 2015 and contact was lost about 400 miles. The expected range was 2,000 miles, but we have no knowledge of where it ended its flight.

Forces:

Although we received a number of Brazilian sighting reports, our files contain none for 19 May 1960.

Dear Sir:

Your office has been very helpful in the past and so I wonder if you could answer this question for me: were any missiles or rockets launched down the Atlantic Missile Range past Brazil on May 13, 1960, between 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. Brazil time?

I am trying to account for a flurry of UFO sightings that occurred in NE Brazil at that time.

Many thanks.

Very truly yours,

Astronomers Sight UFO;
Foreign Reports Increase

A strange white, triangular UFO was
sighted near the Palma Observatory on
the Spanish Mediterranean Island of
Majorca. First seen at 2130 hrs., the
UFO was said to move erratically while
its crew made while holding a steady
course. The observers, who did not
want a satellite, aircraft or balloon,
said the UFO was definitely not a
meteor. In the sighting was of several

February 1, 1967

Dear Sirs:

During the past few years, I have been tempted to report a UFO which I observed on May 26, 1960 in Kirkwood, Mo. However, I was afraid that it would simply be filed and forgotten, so I never filed the report. Recently, though, I read that a renowned professor of physics is going to make an unbiased study of UFO reports with complete access to Air Force files. Because I believe my sighting may be of value in his research, I have decided to submit it to you.

At about 4:30 p.m. on May 26, 1960, I was walking east on West Maple Avenue near my home. Being an airplane, the time since planes approaching Lambert Field often pass over the area, I looked to see if any were coming over. At that time I observed the UFO illustrated below. It was about 75 feet

[A hand-drawn sketch of a UFO is shown, which appears to be a flat, wide oval or disc-shaped object]

off the ground moving due west about 200 yards from me. I say 200 yards for I thought it was just south the Wilson Avenue, 200 yards south of Maple. I had a color which I noted to myself at the time was the same as the silver enamel paint which I used on model airplanes. I saw no apertures or exhaust from it and could hear no noise above the background noise of the nearby traffic. My best estimate was that it was 50 feet long and 30 feet high and had a smooth surface. Though I observed it almost directly from the side, it did seem circular in shape, even though it appeared oval, now that I discussed shape distortion with a friend. It moved in a smooth, steady course at about 15 mph with I presume 15°. I watched it for about 20 seconds, making mental notes, and then ran back to my home about 100 yards away to get binoculars. As I was running, trees partially blocked my view, but I was still able to observe its steady flight. When it came back out, though, it was gone. But I think I should have still been able to see it at the rate it was going, so perhaps it speeded up when I was inside.

- page 37 -

Unfortunately, no one else that I know of saw what I did, which I'm more sorry of than you. At the time I had 20/20 vision, so I know I wasn't just watching a reflection on a glass. And since my brother had been a member of GOC, I was familiar with almost all types of aircraft from his manuals and this was unlike anything in it, as you can probably tell for yourself. If you wish any further details, you can contact me either at the above address or at my permanent residence at 144 West Maple, Kirkwood. No. on certain weekends.

Sincerely yours,

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING
BRAIDWOOD, ILLINOIS

AUTHORITY: AFR 200-2, unclassified message DAO10 2000, 3 June 1960, from Det ADS and Special Orders A-322, 8 June 1960, Hq Chanute Technical Training Center (ATC).

PROCEEDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION: On 9 June 1960, Captain Donald W. Hartranft, AO3004690, 3345th Maintenance and Supply Group, Chanute Technical Training Center (ATC), appointed by Special Order A-322, Hq CTTC, 8 June 1960, proceeded to Braidwood, Illinois to investigate the reported sighting of an unidentified flying object. During the course of this investigation, the following persons were contacted and interviewed in accordance with paragraph 15, AFR 200-2:

[Redacted names and addresses in Joliet, Illinois]

FINDINGS: After careful evaluation of facts disclosed by the persons contacted and encyclopedic research, it was found that:

a. [Redacted names] observed a brilliantly lighted object in the SE quadrant of the sky at 0400Z, 1 June 1960.

b. Simultaneously, Mr. [Redacted], amateur astronomer, observed a similar object at somewhat the same azimuth and elevation.

c. The two observation points cited in a. and b. above are some 32 statute miles apart.

d. The Encyclopedia Americana and the Encyclopedia Britannica substantiate the data reported by the persons interviewed to be that of a natural phenomenon, probably the planet Jupiter.

RECOMMENDATIONS: In view of the above findings, the investigating officer recommends that no further investigation be conducted.
