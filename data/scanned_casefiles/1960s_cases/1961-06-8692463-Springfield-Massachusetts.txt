11. COMMENTS The witnesses were at a drive-in theater and there was no other object. The object remained in one position throughout the sighting. The repeated cycles of the object's location was on an azimuth that would face the object over Westover AFB. There were high thin cirrus clouds at the time, plus a temperature inversion at 8-9,000 ft. MAXAIR light from an unknown source was probably reflecting off the inversion layer rather than the clouds, since it did not move, etc.

[Most of the text in the body of the document is too faint or blurry to read clearly. Some partial lines are visible, but not enough to confidently transcribe.]

In the top right corner, there are some handwritten notes:

Much of the text on this page is illegible or partially obscured. I can make out some fragments of text, but not complete sentences or coherent passages. Some lines appear to have numbers or codes at the left margin, but the details are not clear enough to transcribe with confidence. Large sections of text are blacked out or redacted, making comprehensive OCR impossible.
