indicates the observer is a logical and mature person. He is convinced the objects were not conventional type aircraft or weather balloons. Considerable effort and some investigation on his part did not develop any evidence to this "sighting". No leads or clues were developed that would lead to the identity of the objects. With the elimination of this report, it is believed that all local efforts to identify the objects have been exhausted.
