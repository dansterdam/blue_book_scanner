north

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Half moon in twilight sky. Obj did not appear to move except that in 30 minutes it changed position in relation to the moon from 10 dgr to the light of the moon to ten dgr to the left of the moon. Size about 3X Echo. Two times as bright as Arcturus. White color. No sound. Witness believed object to be satellite.

11. COMMENTS Duration & movement not stationary. Same alt & position in a small area rules out a/c. Initial impression was that obj was star or planet. Mars (mag 1.4) is in approximate position. However, the stars or planets will not change their relationship to the moon by 10dgr in one hour. Possible balloon if balloon. No wind data to determine if balloon could remain in area.

12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Balloon
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
Was Astronomical
Probably Astronomical
Possibly Astronomical
Other:
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Unknown

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    29    6    63
    Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

When I first spotted this object I thought it might be Arcturus because it was about in the position I has seen this star the night before. But the sky was still light, being twilight, and there were no other stars visible. When I saw it had changed position in relation to the moon in the space of 1/2 hour I realized it could not be a star or a planet and when it disappeared completely in a clear sky I knew it was a satellite of the Echo type.

The only text I can definitively see is "Page 8" in the top right corner of the document. The rest of the page appears to be blank or the text is too faint/illegible to read.
