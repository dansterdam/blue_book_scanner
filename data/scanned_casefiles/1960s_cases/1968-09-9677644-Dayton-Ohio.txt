About some 30 sec after first sighting the parties atmosphere and burn up in matter of seconds, this object stopped pointed stars change course slowly changed course again, went out, came back on (no cloud) drifted more fire and went out. This object looked as big and as bright at the end, as the first I saw it. I really don't think it burned up it was too large and bright at the end. It faded from complete brightness to nothing in 5 sec. both times it was very strange and I have no idea what it was.

I have left the exact time out of this form as it is listed right on the phone call to Wright Patt.

Please excuse my spelling and I hope in some way I have helped you.
