MINDAUGAS V. NIKOLAINIS, ACTING WING INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 4747th
TACTICAL FIGHTER WING.

COMMENTS: OBSERVER INSIST SHE SAW OBJECT AT 2542Z AND
CALLED CANNON COMMAND POST TEN MINUTES LATER. CANNON C.P. HAS
HER CALL LOGGED AT 2436Z. IF CALL WAS PROPERLY LOGGED, AS THE
OFFICER BELIEVES, HER OBSERVATION WOULD HAVE COINCIDED WITH THOSE
MENTIONED IN PARA H THIS MSG. FAA CONTROL, ALBUQUERQUE DID NOT
GIVE SIZE OF SIGHTINGS REPORTED, SO THERE IS NO WAY TO CORRELATE
THIS INFORMATION. HOWEVER, SINCE CONTINENTAL NR 58 ESTIMATED OBJECT
TO BE AT FLT LEVEL 292, OBJECT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE TO
OBSERVER AS SHE CLAIMED. ONLY POSSIBLE CAUSE OF OBJECT IS
ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN A METEOROLOGICAL OR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMI-
NON SUCH AS A METEOR.
