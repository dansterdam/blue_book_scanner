12. COMMENTS
Celestia Zeta II scattered on this date, but where or the time of sighting is unclear. Short duration and sharp flight path which was fairly level is more indicative of a meteor, which was probably what was seen. During this time of year the earth is passing through several meteor showers. The object observed by the two witnesses was probably a meteor.
