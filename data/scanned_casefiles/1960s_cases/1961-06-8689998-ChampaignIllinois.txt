SE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Sight objects, round in "V" formation. Sighted almost directly overhead. Second observer saw only one light object. First observer that it was anything except a star. No air traffic reported from local tower. Objects moved from SE to NW, disappearing in about 30 seconds.

11. COMMENTS
No distance moved included and it is assumed that disappearance was overhead also. The constellation Bootes was directly overhead at the time of the sighting, can have several bright stars forming a triangle, including the last magnitude star Arcturus. In his belief that the witness was looking at the constellation Bootes and that clouds were moving across the sky giving the illusion of movement to the objects.

9. INSTRUCTOR, AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE OFFICER COURSE. INTERVIEWS
WITH OBSERVERS ONE AND TWO REVEALED THAT OBSERVER ONE FIRST
SIGHTED THE UFO AND POINTED IT OUT TO OBSERVER TWO. OBSERVER ONE
STATES THAT THE OBJECTS WERE IN V FORMATION MOVING FROM SE TO
NW AND DISAPPEARED IN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SECONDS. OBSERVER TWO
THOUGHT AT FIRST THE OBJECT WAS A STAR BUT APPARENTLY WAS
CONVINCED BY OBSERVER ONE THAT IT WAS UFOS. BOTH OBSERVERS
HAD BEEN LYING ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING. SKY CONDITIONS AT
THIS TIME WAS SCATTERED WITH HIGH BROKEN CLOUD COVER. WIND
WAS FROM 270 TO 235 DEGREES. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE OBJECT
SEEN WAS A STAR, BY LOOKING STRAIGHT UP WITH NO REFERENCE POINT
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THE ILLUSION THAT THE STAR WAS MOVING NW
BECAUSE OF CLOUDS MOVING TO THE SE. CHICAGO CENTER ADVISES THAT
THERE WAS NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC OVER CHAMPAIGN AT THE TIME
OF THE REPORTED SIGHTING.
