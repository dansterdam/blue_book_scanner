13 Nov 1960

Dear Sir,

I don't know if we are sending
this letter into right party or not
as we would like to send it
to you.

A few of the U.S. families here
in Caracas pm a local lake last night
and discovered a bright object
in the sky traveling N - NE
its elevation would not be
determined precisely was
moving a little bit nervous
common at night. The object
was not a star or plane.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

By 7:05pm at sunset of night
During sunset time. Our station
in Maracaibo, Venezuela.
The date was November 18, 1962
Our attention was what was it?
Thinking upon it later

The bottom portion of the document contains some blacked out/redacted text that is illegible.

Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. Reference your letter 8, Subject: "Report of Unidentified
Flying Object", dated 13 November 1960 in information contained in
the Doctor from [redacted], Maracaibo, Venezuela, which you forwarded
to this center, has been evaluated. The object sighted by the [redacted]
8th through 9th November 1960 over Maracaibo, Venezuela.

2. It has been definitely established that the passage of one over
Venezuela on 12 November 1960 occurred at the same time as reported
unidentified object sighting.

3. The description of the object, though sketchy, is similar to
description of echo received at this center from key witnesses. The
probable direction of travel of the unidentified object matches the
direction of motion of the satellite, as seen from Maracaibo, at the
time of the sighting.

4. It has been informed that the object sighted by him on
12 November 1960 was probably Echo.
