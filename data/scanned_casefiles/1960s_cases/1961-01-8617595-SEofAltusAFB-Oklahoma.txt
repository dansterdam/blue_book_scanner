REPLY TO
ATTN CF: TA-3                                     18 January 1961

SUBJECT: UFOs

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB, Texas on 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 January. Not all of these sightings were related.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren G. Piker and Major Donal F. Taylor as they proceeded from the area of Altus AFB, Oklahoma to Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Atch #1). Majors Piker and Taylor are to the Highly reliable sources. Major Piker, has had experience in investigating UFOs, and his conclusion, that the object he observed was probably a satellite or a piece of space hardware, earth on an orbital path, appears to be sound. No other sightings of this object were reported.

3. Reference my message of 15 January TA17024 concerning 10 January sighting. Many ground sightings confirm the description in the path of the object sighted by Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] in the aircraft (see Atch #2 and #3). But, since the report was received by the offices of local news media, the preparing officer was able to obtain only two witnesses' names. The testimony obtained from the description, who is considered reliable, verifies unquestionably the description and part of the object reported from the aircraft (see Atch #4). The cause and identity of this object remain undetermined.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs. [redacted], whose judgment and reliability seem questionable. It is significant that the sighting took place on the day that the local paper headlined the 10 January sighting. Mrs. [redacted] was an inhabitant that saw this strange object (see Atch #5) and she described it as "cigar shaped," the much-used description for UFOs. She left the sighting momentarily to get her husband to see the object, and when they observed the sky together neither one saw the object. Further, no other persons reported seeing this object, which seems unlikely if it hovered in the sky for 30 minutes only a few miles away. It is the preparing officer's conclusion that the object was an illusion, or that Mrs. [redacted] was seeking publicity.

5. Mr. [redacted], programmer and weatherman for KFDX-TV, Wichita Falls, reported that he saw an extremely bright object in the south-west as he drove from Hunter, Oklahoma to Frederick, Oklahoma (see [rest of text cut off])


- page 5 -

Atten #6). Mr. [redacted] judgement and reliability seem high. There were no other reported sightings of this object. The preparing officer is unable to estimate the cause or identity of this object.

5. On 15 January from approximately 0315Z to approximately 0330Z Mr. [redacted] and other employees of KFDA-TV sighted from the station, on the southwest end of Nichols Falls, an object at about 2500 and 100 from the horizon. The object appeared as one lighted (see Atch #6), except that it did not emit a red glow at intervals. The preparing officer is unable to determine the cause or identity of the object.
