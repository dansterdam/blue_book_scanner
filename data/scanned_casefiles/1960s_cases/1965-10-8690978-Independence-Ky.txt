TDEW/UFO
UFO Sightings, 3 October 1965

Hq USAF SAFONIO (Mrs. Hunt)

We have received a completed Form 164 from _______ of Covington, Kentucky. This form contained the information necessary for evaluation. The position given by the observer the object throughout a telescope, was low on the horizon in the Southwest. The time of this observation was 8:03 P.M. on 3 October 1965. The planet Venus has a right ascension of 15 hours and 17 minutes. This places the planet at or near the horizon at an azimuth of 245 degrees in the process of setting.

17 December 1965

Independence, Kentucky

A review of our October 1965 cases reveals that the data on your sighting is insufficient for a firm evaluation. The size and brilliance of the object was compared to the moon. At the time of your report the moon was at 25 degrees elevation to the Southwest in a first quarter phase. The action reported indicates that the object decreased and disappeared several times, and changed color from bright white to bright red. It also indicates that two other witnesses observed the object through a telescope. We would appreciate it if you could fill out one of the attached Form 164 and have a complete and other forms attached. Upon receipt of these completed forms we will attempt to evaluate the sighting.
