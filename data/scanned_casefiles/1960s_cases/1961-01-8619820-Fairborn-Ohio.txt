12 Jan 61

The following, extracted from 1/Lt Shannon's Report dated 11 Jan 61, is quoted for your information:

1930 hours, received a call from the FOD, Maj H. Scarborough, who reported that Maj H. Rosen saw a bright object over Page Manor. Maj Scarborough said he thought the object described to him was actually the Planet Venus, which tonight appears in the Southeast at an elevation of over 45 degrees. I did not contact Maj Rosen.
