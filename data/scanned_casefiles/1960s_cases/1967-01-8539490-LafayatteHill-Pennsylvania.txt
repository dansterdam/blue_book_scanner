Dear Sirs:

In reference to your letter of March 16, requesting photos of, and information on the UFO I saw on the night of January 18, this is enclosing all available information, and five color slides, in this letter.

I will attempt to answer the questions in the order in which they have been asked.

A. The camera is the BESELER TOPCON AUTO 100, a 35mm. single-lens reflex, with a bellows-type lens mount.

B. To answer this question, I will quote from my camera manual. "The standard Topcon lens is a 53 mm. focal length optic, with a speed of 2.8 and a distance of focus in four groups. The lens is 2 1/8 in. long, and the distance of 78 cm."

C. ANSCOCHROME D-200 color slide film, with an ASA rating of 200.

D. Because of the darkness, I used a shutter speed of 1/25th, of a second. It was the slowest speed I could shoot at, and still keep the camera steady.

E. I used the largest lens opening of which my lens is capable, that is 2.8.

F. Filters used: none

I am sorry, however, apologize for the poor quality of the five slides. I realize they are not as good as I would like them to hold the camera steady. I am enclosing a separate slide that was taken last year, unfortunately wasn't supposed when it is a picture of the Moon in it's crescent phase, but a few months ago I projected it under high magnification, and found in one corner, a strange bilobed cylindrical object which I believe to be a telescope. I had made sure that there were no aircraft around in the area at the time when this was located with a black arrow.

U.F.O. - SIGHTED JAN. 18 AND FEB. 3, 1967
DEAR SIR:
WHILE I WAS IN OUR REAR YARD BETWEEN 6:45 AND 7:00 P.M., JANUARY 18TH, I SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WHICH CAME FROM THE SOUTHEAST AND SEEMED TO BE A ROUND LIGHT. IT WAS BLUISH-WHITE IN COLOR AND IT SEEMED TO BE AS LARGE AS AND MOVED ALONG JUST SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE MOON.
AFTER I RUSHED INSIDE TO GET MY CAMERA, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME SATELLITE PASSING OVERHEAD, I COULD NOT FIND IT. IT MUST HAVE PASSED ALONG TO THE MOON AS IT WENT PAST. BUT WHEN I CAME BACK OUT I COULD NOT SEE IT.
THERE WAS A STEADY LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO HOVER FOR A FEW MINUTES. I GRABBED MY BINOCULARS AND FOCUSED ON THE OBJECT BETWEEN THE MOON AND STARS (WHICH WERE OBSCURED BY THE BRIGHT OBJECT). I FOLLOWED IT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND IT THEN SEEMED TO GO BEHIND SOME TREES. LOOKING AT IT THROUGH MY BINOCULARS, I SAW THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT A STAR BECAUSE IT WAS LARGER AND MOVED SO SLOWLY.
THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE LIT OR HAZY-LIGHTED BY SOME UNEXPLAINED LIGHT SOURCE OF ITS OWN. ITS FORWARD MOTION DID NOT APPEAR JERKY, BUT WAS STEADY AS IT MOVED. IT WAS FOLLOWING AN ARCHED COURSE AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING WHEN I FIRST SAW IT. IT MOVED IN RELATION TO THE STARS AND MOON. IT THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE TREES BUT REAPPEARED ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION. AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES IT DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. THIS SAME OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 3RD. IT WAS IN VIEW FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST. IT APPEARED AND REAPPEARED FROM BEHIND TREES SEVERAL TIMES. 
MY WIFE AND FRIENDS ALSO SAW AN UNUSUAL OBJECT ON FEBRUARY 3RD. IT SEEMED TO HAVE A RED AND GREEN LIGHT AND WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR 45 MINUTES. WE WATCHED IT TO SEE IF IT WAS A STAR OR PLANET WE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE, BUT IT DID NOT REMAIN IN A FIXED POSITION LIKE A STAR OR PLANET. IT SEEMED TO BE MANEUVERING, AND AT TIMES HOVERED IN ONE SPOT.
I AM VERY INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THESE OBJECTS. APPROPRIATE NAVY OFFICIALS MAY WANT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.

You may be interested in seeing the photograph which I took of the object I saw. As I said, "reproduced" is the object. It was 20 - 30 feet long and about 5 feet thick, and was in a stationary position northwest of Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania and moved off towards the southeast.

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-34

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ANALYSIS 
LOCATION: LAFAYETTE HILL, PA.
DATE: 18 January 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF: - 
PR: 8x 35mm slides
QUALITY: -

1. PURPOSE: This report is written in response to Work Order Number 67-44 submitted by Major DONALD E. KEYHOE, requesting analysis of six slides to determine what they depict.

2. ANALYSIS: The six slides submitted are from two separate processing dates. Five slides, apparently processed on 17 January 1966, were assigned processing number 17, and one slide, apparently processed on 18 January 1967, was assigned processing number 1. The image located near the center of slide number 17, the results of a processing defect, is a possible object "of a processing defect". When viewed under 50 power magnification, three apparent objects having a January 1967 processing date, are a very interesting anomaly and deserve a detailed analysis and a satisfactory explanation as to their origin.

Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs. Please advise, however, our present heavy workload has prevented an earlier reply.

2. Examination of the slides revealed that the images located near the corner of slide number 17, May 1966, is possibly the result of a processing problem. When viewed under higher magnification, these separate images are visible. The other six slides having 18 January 1967 processing dates, however, have been examined in detail, found satisfactory on analysis and a satisfactory explanation as to their origin.

3. Although a positive explanation has not been made, investigation revealed that an alternative could have been responsible for the vague images. Factors such as irregularity, angular velocity, etc., such an explanation would be only a possibility.

Dear Sirs:

About two months ago, I sent you some color slides of a UFO, and I have not received any acknowledgment or comments. Of course, these are thousands of sighting reports ahead of mine, and I realize that all I am sending you is a description of these slides, and the fact that I have them.

It seems out of the north-west, it was a "bright blue-white light", and when it came to a standstill, it was with a steady shine not pulsating. just a steady shine about one-quarter the size of the Moon. Though it was some sort of satellite, that rose in the north-west and passed in the east-south-east through the sky, it was not blinking as conventional satellites and I cannot state its exact size and can only say that it seemed to be about one-quarter the size of the Moon.

When I came back out however, the blue-white light had disappeared, but I did notice a reddish-brown light moving in the same direction as the blue-white light, just as this light was diminishing, rapidly I should say, I verified this by locking on to it through a pair of 7x50 binoculars, the UFO stopped just opposite of me, small in size, it did not move farther than that position or in any other direction. Then it stayed motionless for several minutes, then gradually swung around to a southerly course, which it maintained till it disappeared.

The slides of the UFO are on Agfachrome D-200, exposure was 1/4 of a second at aperture F/2.8, the slides are numbered 12, 13, 15, 16 & 17 respectively. There is also a separate Agfachrome slide that was taken through a three-inch astronomical telescope at about thirty power. It is a picture of the Moon in its crescent phase, but in one corner marked with a black arrow, there is an unidentified bright object.

Dear Sir:

While I was in our rear yard between 6:45 and 7:00 P.M. January 18th, I saw an unusual object which came from the north-northeast and passed to the south-southeast at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be silvery or metallic.

After I rushed inside to get my camera because I thought it was some sort of aircraft, by the time I returned it had disappeared. Since I was not one of the probable sources, it should have been easy to be recorded, but as you know in a situation like this the time element is very urgent.

As the object passed over I was able to see it quite clearly and I'd say it was about the size of a 7 x 50 binoculars and from the object between the moon (which was at a quarter phase and did not appear to be in the object's pathway) there seemed to be a small reddish light, rather than a trail, along the path of the object.

Looking at the object through the binoculars I noticed that it did not seem to have any visible means of propulsion. I have the impression that the bright light I saw and soon following when I saw the object had gone in about 5 or 10 seconds. Then the object quickly disappeared to the south.

I was not only the object I was observing but a small bird flew by at the same time, leaving me to wonder if the bird had not been attracted by the object.

Of course you can readily determine, toward the southeast, 1.5 miles, is a control station tower and the object's route took it directly over this. I wonder if the object was in some way connected with this installation? I verified this by checking the compass direction.

I always listen and watch for unusual phenomena, not only the object I was observing but a small bird flew by at the same time, leaving me to wonder if the bird had not been attracted by the object. So you can understand my interest in determining, if possible, what this object was.

While I saw three successive photographs of this object, using exposures D-300. The first three frames were taken, while the object was stationary. A shutter speed of 1/25 sec. at f.3.5 was used. It was a fluttering object, semi-circular in shape. The object then moved off at a high speed.

My husband and friends also saw an unusual object on February 3rd, while on their way home from church. It was hovering just above the treetops and slowly moved down and then went back up. She and her friends were on their way to work and did not have a camera to take a picture.

I am very interested in learning more about these objects as I will greatly appreciate any information and assistance you can provide. I will await your reply.

The document is dated February 13, 1967 and is addressed to a party interested in seeing the photographs taken of the object. The letter indicates that the photographs are not included and that the details of the sighting are not too distant.

Here is the text from the document:

You may be interested in seeing the photographs which I took of the object I saw. As I stated before, the object came from the northwest or north-northeast, to the best of my knowledge. William Greve at a station in northwest or Lafayette Hill and I were the only ones who saw it. It is not too distant.
