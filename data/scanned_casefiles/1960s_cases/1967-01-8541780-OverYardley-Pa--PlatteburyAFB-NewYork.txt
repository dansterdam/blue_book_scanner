MEMO for the Record:   1 Feb 67

Contact with SPADATS revealed that on 25 Jan 67 there were several decays. The one most likely responsible for the observation was the decay of object number 2658 and object number 2659. Object #2658 was the rocket body of Cosmos 139 while object # 2659 was some additional space debris. SPADATS said that object # 2658 had no time for decay since it decayed shortly after launch. No definite data was obtained on the object since it had such a short life.

[First paragraph is mostly illegible, with only fragments of words discernible]

THE RECORD-POST, AU SABLE FORKS, N. Y., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1967

Local People
Report U.F.O. Seen
Last Week Wed.

Wayne Strong, Randy Miller
and Steve Mace all of Au Sable
Forks and several others spotted
an unidentified flying object flying in a southeast direction over
Au Sable Forks last Wednesday
night. They saw the object overhead about 10:30 p. m. while
they were standing in the parking lot next to the National Commercial Bank and Trust Co.

Strong said he had reported the
UFO to the Pittsburgh Air Force
Base. It was similar to a jet aircraft, he said but "round." He
ruled out the possibility it was
a bomber or a tanker with its
landing light on. The object moved noiselessly, he said, and it appeared to race "light all over;
they were white like plane
lights."

"It just appeared," said Strong.
"There wasn't anything there before and then, all of a sudden, it
was overhead. It took about 45
seconds to a minute before it had
glided off to the southeast. He
could not estimate the object's
distance from the ground. It was
approximately the size of the
moon. Strong said, and appeared
to be about the height of an aircraft would be."

Strong, Miller and Mace had
the impression the object had descended toward the ground and
then moved away, slowly.

The UFO was also seen by Mr.
and Mrs. Paul Maicus, who were
traveling towards Jay. Maicus, a
World War II gunner and he had
never seen anything like it in his
2,000 hours of flying. He described the object as having a bright
tail.

It was also viewed by Howard
Snow and George Yando. Snow
thought it looked like a comet
with a tail but didn't like one.

The rest of the document is a road map showing various cities and highways, primarily in the New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania regions. The map includes city names like Newburgh, Beacon, Middletown, Yonkers, Paterson, and many others. There are various highway and road markings, but due to the complexity of the map, I cannot transcribe every single location name.

The map appears to be from a Gulf Oil touring guide, designed to help travelers navigate the northeastern United States.
