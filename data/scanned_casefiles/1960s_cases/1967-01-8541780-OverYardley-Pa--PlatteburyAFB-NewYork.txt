The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text document discussing details from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects. The text discusses an object with the designation #2658 and provides details about its examination and analysis.

MEMO for the record: 1 Feb 67
Contact with SPADATS revealed that on 25 Jan 67 there were several observed objects. The one most likely responsible for the object 2658 number is object #2659. SPADATS said that object # 2659 was the rocket body of Cosmos 139, while object # 2658 was some additional space debris. SPADATS said that object # 2658 had no time for decay since it is decayed shortly after launch. No definite data was obtained on the object since it had such a short life.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

(The handwritten text on the page is as follows:)
"I was within 25 feet of this object and could see details quite clearly. It appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and hovering approximately 10 feet off the ground. It was a bright chrome color and had no visible means of propulsion. There was no sound at all. After observing it for about 5 minutes, it simply disappeared into the night sky at a very high rate of speed. I was quite shaken by this experience and had difficulty relating the details to the authorities at the time. If there are any further questions regarding this incident, I would be happy to assist in any way possible."

(Handwritten text)
Wematerial that this report by at about 2:00 a.m on 8 JAnuary 1967 and discussed with Lt. JONES was an unusual light observed in the sky over Yardley, Pennsylvania by one of the observers. He stated that the light was first observed to the west of Yardley, PA and was moving in a northeasterly direction rapidly. The light was described as having a pulsing or flashing appearance and was similar to a meteor but was much slower in speed and appeared lower in the sky. The observers followed the light as it moved across the sky and it eventually disappeared from sight to the northeast. Both GUTHRIE and the observers were unable to determine the exact nature of the light and no conclusions were reached by them. GUTHRIE stated that the observers appeared to be sincere and did not notice any evidence that they might be fabricating or exaggerating the report. It appeared to be a valid report of an unusual phenomenon observed in the night sky.

THE RECORD-POST, AU SABLE FORKS, N. Y., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1967

Local People
Report U.F.O. Seen
Last Week Wed.
Wayne Strong and Steve Mero, both of Au Sable
Forks, reported seeing an unidentified flying object in
the sky over Ausable Forks last Wednesday evening
around 10:30 p.m. while they were sitting in the Mero
home. They said the object was traveling in a southeast
direction over Ausable Forks. Police headquarters in
Plattsburgh also received a report about the same time
from a man who said he saw the object over Plattsburgh
and stated it was a round, bright light. Strong said he
had reported the UFO to the State Police at Plattsburgh
and the State National Guard at Plattsburgh. Strong
said the UFO appeared to be a bomber but "around it
was a strange kind of a bluish light." He said the object
appeared to be moving "real slow" and then it picked up
speed and went straight up and disappeared. He said
it was white like plane lights.
"It was shaped sort of like an aircraft," said Strong,
"but we couldn't make out anything there because the
lights were very bright." He said it appeared to be about
a mile or a mile and a half up in the sky. Strong said he
and Mero watched the object for some time and it seemed
to be moving very slowly at first and then it "took off"
and went straight up and out of sight. He said it seemed
to glide off to the southwest. He could not estimate the
distance, but said it must have been several miles away.
He said, "It was about the size of an aircraft and seemed
to be at approximately the size of a DC -8 plane." Strong
said the object seemed to have a light on the top and on
the bottom. The entire size of the object, he said, would be
about the height of an aircraft, which would be 35 to 40
feet. Strong said the object had a tail and that it seemed
to have a twin turbine and that is why he thought it
might have been a bomber. He said the object "floated"
for a distance, then all of a sudden shot straight up and
disappeared.
Strong said he called the State Police at Plattsburgh
and also the State National Guard about the sighting.
He said there were no other reports in that area at the
time. The incident occurred while Strong was traveling
towards Jay, Maine. It was several miles away and he
said he had been traveling for about 2,000 hours of
flying. He described the object as being a bright light.
It was also viewed by Howard Stone and George Meade,
who thought it looked like a giant with a tail but didn't
act like the one.
