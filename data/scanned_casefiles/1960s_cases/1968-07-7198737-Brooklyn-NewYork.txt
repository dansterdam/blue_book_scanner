I am convinced that I saw a something which is not from this world possibly some kind of flying object from another planet.

The picture seen does appear to be a definite object as there could be near certain details and form clearly visible and distinguable with a clear outline. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, and of reasonable size, estimated at about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It was observed clearly in the eastern sky for a period of time, estimated at 3 to 5 minutes, before disappearing rapidly out of sight.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

APR 20-17(CII)

IF WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD AT ARMS LENGTH, IN SIGHT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR ANTENNA, WOULD THAT GIVE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE AS TO THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT SEEN? UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE IN EVALUATING REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. IT IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED THAT OBSERVERS BE INSTRUCTED TO MAKE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WHEN POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH THIS PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED AT THE MATCH HEAD.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POINT OF THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENA WHEN FIRST SEEN AND ALSO AT THE POINT WHICH REPRESENTS THE MOVEMENT OR CHANGE OF THE PHENOMENA BETWEEN OBSERVATIONS. RECORD BELOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT FROM THE FIRST POINT WAS TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT THAT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS UP OR DOWN, ETC. THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT AS IT MAY ASSIST IN ANALYZING THE PATTERN OF THE PHENOMENA.

MEMORANDUM

September 6, 1963

SUBJECT: [redacted] of New York City called about 
3:30 p.m. today.

He advised that he sent you 133-g5g 
UFO pictures about three weeks ago, and wanted to
know why he had not received any acknowledgment.

He asked him why he had not written you,
as he had previously informed him that he'd written you.
He said therefore he was writing you again.

If you have his pix, suppose he now has them? If
not, let him know if and when you receive them.

The text reads as follows:

"Thank you for your letter. I hope this clears up the question about a UFO I reported on July 7, 1968 in Brooklyn, New York. The object I saw was oval shaped, silver in color and about 40 or 50 feet in diameter. It moved very slowly and silently at a low altitude. After about 10 minutes it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. I realize that my report may have been a misidentification, but I am quite sure of what I saw that evening. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your consideration."

UFO Reports from Brooklyn, New York

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of several unidentified flying object (UFO) reports from observers in the Brooklyn, N.Y. area. These observers have been calling the Duty Officer collect.

2. On 16 and 19 August 1968, this office verbally requested that the Brooklyn, N.Y. field office of the FBI obtain additional details regarding these particular sightings. However, they are continuing to call. Therefore, I recommend the following:

a. Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914, John R-1300.
b. Suffolk County, N.Y., area code 516, Southampton 4-1900.

3. If the caller is persistent, please inform him in a kindly manner regarding the proper procedure for the reporting of UFOs. In addition, the local UFO investigator is in a better position to conduct an on-site investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

Lt. Attached is a listing of those persons who have been calling from the Brooklyn, New York area.

MEMO ON THIS RECORD 15 AUGUST 1963
SUBJ: UFO Reports by Mrs. Stangcahs called the UFO Command Post, San Davis, on 15 August 1963 in regard to frequent (almost nightly) UFO reports that the Duty Officer has been receiving from (name) of Brooklyn, New York. If all the Duty Officer again, they will inform him that in accordance with Air Force Regulation 80-17 he should contact the nearest Air Force base, which would be either Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914 John 2-1300 or Suffolk County AFB, New York, area code 516 Westhhampton 4 - 1900. Airman Davis said they would be glad to inform (name) of this fact.
On 19 August 1963 Mr. (name) again called Airman Davis to inform him that we are still receiving numerous reports from Brooklyn, New York, from a group of youngsters. Mrs. (name) asked Airman Davis to leave a note with the Duty Officer to accept any collect phone calls from these youngsters calling from Brooklyn New York. They should be referred to either Suffolk County or Stewart AFB, New York, in accordance with AFR 80-17.
