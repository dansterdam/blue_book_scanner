Here is the text I can read from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

[Top text is partially illegible, but appears to be instructions about marking compass directions]

In the block below place an "A" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "B" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the "A" and "B" with a line to approximate the movement of the phenomenon between A and B. If the movement is erratic, show whether the movement appears to be straight, curved or zig-zag. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

The document contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches showing a landscape scene with a figure standing on a road, with what appears to be a UFO trajectory marked.

The only other important thing was
their speed and maneuverability. They did
not appear to be in any way controlled almost
critical almost colored. People
passing by didn't believe we but who have
been here saw a helicopter because of
its maneuverability but its shape was not their
characteristic. Their movement was so quick
from side to side was from another
was from when it flew along, and
this we have we were able to compare
it with angles. First we collected our
thoughts and then if they could track, aware
with what area they faced now. We call
this the most and they both have
a map and we know we have been along 340

This report is only one of the cases types of UFO's in New York State in re: the 24th of July and they have been seen by many more witnesses than I have listed here from

We have tried calling the local P.F. bases in the city, but none of them have listened or authorized to investigate, and the same goes for the police. So, myself, have called again office in Dayton. I have one figure man said he would hear from you. Some other type of effect you have seen has been colored by my friend, Cliff Gycko on his form. We have seen them continuously getting quite nervous about the effect. I hope you will conduct a thorough investigation of our sighting meanwhile, we shall keep in touch.

Unidentified Flying Object Sightings

Brooklyn, New York 11220

1. Reference your photographs of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that you made on 27 July 1968. If you desire a photographic analysis of these photographs, data can be completed on your sighting. Upon receipt of this material we will forward your photographs to the Photographic Analysis Section at Wright-Patterson AFB. Please complete the AF Form 117 on your 27 July sighting and for no other date last 11 Aug 1968. Since you have contacted the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information, and have told them that you want your pictures back, we are including them. However, as many have now been accomplished on them to date. If you desire the analysis, please be sure to return the original negatives and original Polaroid photographs in the envelope provided. Analysis will take approximately two to three months.

2. Reference your unidentified observations that are occurring almost nightly. The Duty Officer has been instructed not to accept any more telephone calls from you, since the local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis. You should contact either:

a. Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914 JOhn 2-1300
b. Suffolk County AFB, New York, area code 516, Westhampton 4-1900.

3. Since you and your friends are observing these objects almost nightly, we feel that you are misinterpreting natural conventional objects, such as astronomical bodies, aircraft, satellites, etc.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

MEMORANDUM

September 4, 1968

TDFN/UFO:

3:30 p.m. of New York City called about

He claimed that he sent you some alleged
UFO pictures about three weeks ago, and now he
wants them returned.

I asked him why he had not mailed you,
and he further claimed that he'll try, but
could not get you.

If you have his pix, suggest you send, and
then work to him (he sounded all okay, but
about what I haven't the foggiest).

Dear Sir,

Enclosed in this envelope is a picture of what we believe to be a U.F.O. taken on the night of July 27, 1968. This is one of the two types of objects we have seen. The other type, the one we have sighted, most frequently, I have tried to draw at the reverse. Phenomenon I witness, Project Blue Book, Cleveland, OH

UFO Reports from Brooklyn, New York

5 SEP 1969

REPLY

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of several unidentified UFO object (UFO) reports from Brooklyn, New York area. These youngsters have been calling the Duty Officer collect, several times a week, since 7 August 1968.

2. On 15 and 19 August 1968, this office verbally requested that the Duty Officer not accept any telephone calls from these youngsters in the New York area and they should be referred to the nearest Air Force base. However, they are continuing to call. Therefore, we recommend that the Duty Officer not accept any UFO reports from the Brooklyn, New York area. Infor the caller that if he wishes to report an unidentified flying object sighting he should contact the nearest Air Force base which would be either:

a. Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914, John 2-1300
b. Suffolk County AFB, New York, area code 516, Westhampton 4-1900

3. If the caller is persistent, please inform him in a kindly manner that this is in accordance with Air Force Regulation 80-17, which governs the reporting of UFOs. In addition, the local UFO investigator is in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

4. Attached is a listing of those persons who have been calling from the Brooklyn, New York area.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                16 August 1968

SUBJ: UFO Reports by [redacted]

Mrs Stancombe called the FTD Command Post, San Davis, on 16 August 1968 in regards to frequent (almost nightly) UFO reports that the Duty Officer has been receiving from [redacted] (age 15) of Brooklyn, New York. If [redacted] is the Duty Officer again, they will inform him that in accordance with Air Force Regulation 80-17 he should contact the nearest Air Force base, which would be either Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914 John 2-1300 or Suffolk County AFB, New York, area code 516 Westhampton 4 - 1900. Airman Davis said they would be glad to inform [redacted] of this fact.

19 August 1968

On 19 August 1968 Mrs [redacted] again called Airman Davis to inform him that we are still receiving numerous reports from Brooklyn, New York, from a group of youngsters. Mrs [redacted] asked Airman Davis to leave a note with the Duty Officer instructions to to accept any collect phone calls from these youngsters calling from Brooklyn New York. They should be referred to either Suffolk County or Stewart AFB, New York, in accordance with AFR 80-17.
