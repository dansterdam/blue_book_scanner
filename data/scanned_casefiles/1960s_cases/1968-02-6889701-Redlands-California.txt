PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 4 Feb 68
2. LOCATION: Redlands, California
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6-7 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: NW
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Probable: AIRCRAFT

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a round object that had 6 to 10 red and orange lights. The object produced a sound similar to the sound used on the T.V. show the Invaders. Dogs in the area barked and the observers hair stood on end.

Comments: No unusual objects were tracked on nearby radar. A search and rescue team passed near the observers home near the time of the sighting. They were using an electric siren that produced a high-pitched oscillating whine which was probably responsible for the noise the observer heard. A light plane arrived at Tri-City airport at 1915 PSR and had a traffic pattern similar to the path of the UFO.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (UFO)

TO: ETID
    Wright Patterson AFB Ohio

1. Sunday, 4 Feb 68, at approximately 1930 PST the Norton AFB Dispatch Section of Base Operations received a phone call concerning a UFO. The woman's description was very incoherent. Furthermore she would not supply her address or telephone number. Due to the nature of the telephone conversation the dispatcher could only ignore the incident and the UFO Officer was not contacted.

2. The first indication of a UFO sighting received by this activity was from a Mr John Ahrens of the University of Colorado. Mr Ahrens called on Friday, 9 Feb, and asked if an investigation had been initiated by our activity. I told him that we were unaware of the sighting. Mr Ahrens said he was advised of the UFO sighting by Dr Seff of the University of Redlands, Redlands, California. Dr Seff works in support of the UFO Early Warning Coordinators System employed by the University of Colorado. I immediately contacted Dr Seff and was informed that he had implemented an investigation aided by Dr Kranz and Dr Sanderson also of the University of Redlands. They had interviewed the children (2 girls and a boy) of the family and a Mr. All resided in the same general area in Redlands, Calif. All the witnesses reported approximately the same findings. Their investigation was concluded by the following:

a. The UFO sighting was not caused by a conventional aircraft. They did not rule out the possibility of a helicopter, if there had been one in the area.

b. The loud whinnying sound associated with the UFO was similar to the sound used on the TV show the "Invaders". The sound caused many dogs in the area to bark.

c. Mr. a witness, disclosed that he had a tingling sensation during the sighting that caused the hair on his body to stand on end. Dr Seff suggested that this description implied the presence of some sort of electromagnetic force.

Dr Seff is now attempting to contact additional witnesses. The results of his investigation will be forwarded to the University of Colorado.

3. After discussing the entire UFO sighting with Dr Saff I conducted a belated investigation.

4. The following UFO report is submitted in accordance with AFR 80-17. The attached UFO worksheet includes all information required by the above regulation.

5. Mr [redacted] at the Redlands Police Department, was interviewed by this investigating officer. All questions asked were answered on the attached UFO worksheet. It should be noted at this time that the answers are very similar to the answers given to Dr Saff and his associates when the same witness was interviewed by them. In addition, two articles that appeared in the local Redlands newspaper are attached.

6. Comments of the investigating officer are:

a. From all the information gathered, it would be most likely to assume that the sound heard by [redacted] and caused the dogs to bark was the electronic siren that produced a high-pitched oscillating whine by the San Gorgonio Search and Rescue Team as stated in the newspaper article, dated 7 Feb 68. The team moved through the area approximately four to five blocks from the location of the witness, in the same direction described by him, and at the identical time of the sighting.

b. As mentioned in the news article dated 7 Feb the implication is made that the mystery of the strange sound, seems to be satisfied by the proximity of the search and rescue team. But what of the moving lights in the sky? The investigation disclosed that a light plane arrived at Tri-City airport at 1915 PST, Sunday, 4 Feb 68. The traffic pattern for light planes at Tri-City would cause a flight path similar to the path of the UFO lights described by Mr [redacted]. There was no helicopter or aircraft in the vicinity at the time nor did March AFB Approach Control, located at March AFB, paint any unusual targets on radar during the time span. In addition, no weather ballons were released in the immediate area during this period.

c. Based on the strength of the facts presented, the possibility exists that a/c flight path of the light plane accompanied by the search and rescue siren caused this UFO report.
