10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Long, possibly pointed object, no wings or tail visible, appeared to be approx 20 times as large as a B-47. Sighting at dusk. Color not determined due to sun reflection off of object. Haze layer present. Witness heard jet and looked up.

11. COMMENTS
Since there was but one witness this report is classified as insufficient data. The object was possibly an ac, although none were reported in the area. Witness claimed to hear sound of jet. Any object 20 times the size of a B-47 would have no doubt been witnessed by others over a city the size of Waco.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Vicinity Waco, Texas
Date 10 May 1960 Hour (Z) 00227

WX Clear, vis 15-20 mi in light haze, winds N & NW at 5 to 45 knots

Description Long-possibly pointed like ball pt pen, size 20 times as large as a B-47, heard jet soft and looked up, first seen at 345 deg elev Ank, disapp 025 deg elev unk, flt path to E., made 90 deg turn to N. with no apparent change in direction of flight, disapp due to loss of eye focus, seen for 1 seconds.

Direction of Motion East, then North

Satellites: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Ruled out due to the reported maneuver

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1) None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc) Ruled out

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Pass Acft; however, the reporting officer stated that there were no known acft in the area

Other Insufficient Data ( 1 witness )

Evaluation of Source Reliability

Analysis and Conclusions: The witness said that he heard a jet acft, yet the reporting officer stated that there were no known acft in the area. If the witness could not determine the color due to the sun reflecting off of it. If the object was as large as the witness reported, it was anomalous. Anything as large as the witness reported would have been seen and reported by many people. Only one witness saw it, so this report is evaluated as insufficient data, 1 witness.
