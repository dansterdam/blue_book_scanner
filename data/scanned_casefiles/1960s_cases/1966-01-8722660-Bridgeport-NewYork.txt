Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The sighting was of brief duration, less than 60 seconds. The object was observed at tree top level and 
distance varied from 350 yards to 1200 yards. The speed was estimated at 700 to 1000 miles per hour. The 
object made a whistling sound and was illuminated with a bright white light which was shaped like a 
parabolic reflector surface of a searchlight or something similar. The light was so bright it was impossible
 to observe details of the object's shape or form. This was not the only object observed. There were three 
objects traveling in formation and then separating out at high speed. This was witnessed by three other 
adult witnesses in addition to the reporting witness.
