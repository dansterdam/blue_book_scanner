11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched an object that was shaped like a horse-
shoe and also described as a vapor trail in the shape of
a question mark. The object had a radius of approximately ten feet in length. Object appeared to remain
stationary, but gradually faded away with the coming of
daylight.

A Nike-Iroquois rocket was launched from Eglin AFB
at 0540 CST, 16 January 1967. At altitude there was a
barium cloud release which was seen up to about 300
miles. The description is consistent with that of this
cloud release.

Gentlemen:

On the evening of January 13, 1967, I telephoned your office regarding several UFO sightings by my husband, a friend, and me. In the verbal report, I mentioned that I had observed strange-looking objects on three successive nights (January 16-18) and that the one I came closest to was near Frankfort.

Because of my curiosity about this object's proximity to the power plant, I have since returned to the area of the sighting and discovered that from the power lines, moving was located exactly one-half of a mile from the power lines which cross over the highway at that point.

You will notice in the clipping I am enclosing (from the January 20, 1967, Frankfort State Journal) that all witnesses excluding the report of an object near the Shelbyville way-station prior to the power failure there, described the objects they saw as moving in the direction of Lawrenceburg, or as being located in the sky toward Lawrenceburg.

You will notice, too, that one witness described the object she saw as looking to be "about one size of water towers". In my report, I used the same analogy to describe the object I watched near the KU plant on January 18.

Several other reports, similar to the ones I am enclosing, have come to my attention during the past week, and one of those reports is similar to the object he saw to me as similar to my own report. The person described the object near Frankfort and it looked kind of like a water tower. "This was seen in Shelby County on January 15 at 7 a.m., and it was in the sky in the direction of Lawrenceburg.

The similarity of all of these accounts is striking, I think, and I felt that you should receive this additional information. Perhaps it will be of some help in the study being made concerning UFOs.

Sincerely,
Mrs.

Radiant, Moving Objects Sighted

'I Know I Saw It—I'm Not Crazy'

By ALBERT E. DIX
Monday, January 16, began about like any other day, a mid-water day.

On a farm about 15 miles east of Frankfort, a man rose from a warm bed, dressed, and stepped outside his home to see a breath of clear, morning air and do a few household jobs before he started to work in the Capital City.

At 6:20 a.m. it was still dark. The stars twinkled in a near-cloudless sky.

Suddenly, there it was, something in the sky which, he said, remained a fixed, amazing cloud. A relative of the man saw the same phenomenon.

"I don't give a much thought to it at the time, thinking perhaps it was a cloud being reflected by the sun."

The identity of the man is less road and turned onto the Lawrenceburg Road at a spot about two miles from Frankfort. There it was, something in the sky. "It was shaped at the top like a saucer round. But way home, about a 10 minute ride, almost exactly, the picture was taken."

In Shelbyville the night of Sunday, January 15, a high school youth called his school principal to report sighting a bright, large, unidentified flying object in the southeast of the Shelby County area.

Early Wednesday morning three women, two of vision and one was actually from work, she stepped into her car, drove down to the windows.

The State Journal knows about two miles from Frankfort, him to be a trained observer. There it was, something in the sky.

In Shelbyville the night of Sunday, January 15, a high school youth called his school principal to report sighting a bright, large unidentified flying object in the southeast of the Shelby County area.

The woman's description fit: "I know I saw it. I'm not crazy." She said at the time she had it in sight and lost it just before 7 a.m. Wednesday.

The top of the object was round-shaped and coming from a source-taped and coming from a source-hoped and coming from a light at some height above the ground. It was moving in a bar it looked to be about the same size as a car.

In the top of the radiant object she saw no other lights. "I wasn't frightened, more like it was coming down to the Lawrenceburg the top. It didn't look as if it were moving too much more. By the clock in her home, it was 6:15 a.m. the same morning."

Rough estimates based on the time she first saw it indicate she had it in sight and lost it just before 7 a.m. Wednesday.

"All this I know is a fact and I am not crazy," she said.

The woman spotted the object just before 7 a.m. Wednesday. She watched it for a few minutes just before 7 a.m. Wednesday. She called her family, told her husband, and watched it for about 20 minutes. To her it was stopped something like a car at the top with this house color. "It was no cloud. It had substance." She said, "and it turned to Page 16, Column 4.

The early-morning sky was clear. Nothing marred it except the object, steadily moving in a southwest direction.

The three ladies told very few people about their experience. Like many others who see such phenomena in the sky, objects they can't explain or identify, they tend to remain quiet for fear of ridicule.

Two days earlier, the man who had seen the object had a most puzzling experience, and who had seen something climb into his car to drive the few miles to Frankfort, and his job.

The sky was still dark. At 6:30 he had seen something moving a green, gaseous cloud. But he dismissed it almost entirely as a reflection from the sun, smoke from a January 15 the first in the se- chimney or some coming from a tobacco stripping room to be drove along U.S. 60, Shelbyville.

"I stopped the car, walked to report a bright light moving at critically just southeast of Shelbyville.

This time I viewed it as one object. There was little of any movement to it. It had the shape of a balloon, the type used many years ago, the hot-air filled bal- loon and gondola attached. It had a light green color and I estimate was somewhere between 750 and 1,000 feet in altitude.

For 20 minutes he stared into the sky. "The object definitely had no visible top to it; there were no other lights around it. Again, it was shaped as much the same as a balloon with a soft, greenish glow."

State Policemen in Elizabethtown were reporting a similar object at the same time, morning, on the same day.

The night before, Sunday, on the same site of the paper and radio station there was a continuation of sightings of unidentified objects in the sky came from the area.

had called the school principal to report a bright light moving almost as quickly as he could turn his head.

The young man said the moving light was elongated in shape, almost cylindrical in form.

A few minutes after spotting the first light, another point of light hovered over one spot of the rolling countryside then disappeared, almost as quickly as it came into view.

The youth's call was made about 9 p.m. Just over an hour after a phone failure lasting about 50 minutes placed most of the city in darkness, just before the power went out, a soft, blue light was reported in the vicinity of Shelbyville's section.

For three days residents of Shelbyville read newspaper and radio station reports of the spotting of lighted objects in the sky. Many were described as saucer-shaped.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NO. 67-28

CHEMICAL LAUNCHES CONTINUE

EGLIN AFB, Fla., Jan. 17--A chemically produced vapor cloud was visible within a 300 mile radius of Eglin AFB Monday evening due to the second and third high altitude research probe tests launched from the Aerospace Launch Facility on Santa Rosa Island.

The second launch of the day took place at 5:34 p.m. (C.S.T.), followed by a third at 6 p.m. The final two launches are scheduled to take place late Wednesday afternoon.

Both launches Monday evening were very successful, according to Mr. Marshall Cartledge, Space Systems Branch of the Aircraft and Missile Test Division, Air Proving Ground Center. The launch vehicle, a two stage Nike-Iroquois, contained a vaporized barium payload which was released at an altitude of 100 nautical miles.

Mr. Cartledge said the cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field. The cloud drifted in a northerly direction and was visible for 30 minutes.

Proposed reply to Letter from Mrs. Gerald Greenliler, 26 January 1967

Dear Mrs.

Reference your letter of 26 January 1967 concerning several unidentified flying object sightings by your husband and other individuals on three successive nights. Our office has received several reports of a bluish-green cloud on the morning of 16 June 1966. These reports were from Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and now Kentucky. A detailed investigation into the matter revealed that Eglin AFB, Florida was engaged in an upper atmosphere research study at the time of the sighting. A two stage Nike-Iroquois rocket which contained a vaporized barium payload was launched at approximately 0548 CST 16 January 1967. At an altitude of approximately 100 miles, the barium payload was injected. This produced an enormous green vapor cloud which was visible for several hundred miles. The Public Information Office at Eglin informed our office that this cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field and was visible for approximately 30 minutes.

The description in the news clipping you provided is quite similar to those we have already received concerning the 16 January 1967 early morning observation. Upper atmospheric research studies this past year has been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

As for the other sightings I can offer no comments without additional information. If you and your husband would complete the
