Gentlemen:

On the evening of January 13, 1967, I telephoned your office regarding several matters I mentioned that I had observed strange-looking objects in the verbal report I made to your office on January 13, 1967. I was informed that such reports are filed and no further action is taken on these unless some special circumstances were involved.

Because of my curiosity about the object's proximity to the power plant, I am enclosing a report I made concerning this observation. As soon as the object was discovered, measures were taken to determine from the power plant operators whether they had noticed anything unusual at that point.

You will notice in the enclosing (from the January 26, 1967, report) that the Lawrenceburg sub-station of the power company had discovered a power failure at the time the object was sighted and was investigating the cause.

You will notice, too, that one witness described the object as oscillating or pulsating at several points on its surface. This behavior seemed similar to the description of the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, object that made the news some time later.

Several other reports, similar to the one I am enclosing, have come to my attention during the past week, and one of those suggests a similar object traveling at high speed and observing my report. The proximity of the object to the power plant is a striking circumstance, and I think, and I felt you would be interested in the additional information.

Sincerely,

Radiant. Moving Objects Sighted
"I Know I Saw It--I'm Not Crazy"
By ALBERT E. DIX
On a farm about 12 miles east of Savannah, Ga., on the evening of Sunday, January 15, began strange thoughts crossing my mind.
"I didn't give it much thought at the time, thinking perhaps it was a cloud being reflected by the sun."
At 6:30 a.m. it was still dark. The start of daylight in a blueish-gray, cloudless sky.
Suddenly, there was, somewhat unexplainably, a stirring of something unusual coming from this direction. Could it be a group of ducks or geese, I thought. As I looked I could see, almost directly overhead, a strange, radiant-like objects.
"It was moving rapidly, erratic in its motion, and was blinking off and on," he said.
One was sighted at about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday, 80 miles southwest of Warner Robbins.
The object, he said, was moving toward the southwest at a high rate of speed, blinking off and on. He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, silver in color, and that it gave off a reddish glow. 
It didn't make any noise that could be heard, and there were no visible means of propulsion.
The witness stated that he observed the object for about 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from view in the distance.

wasn't too far off the ground, the usual stopping height of the describe highway being about a thousand feet."
The early-morning sky was clear. Nothing marred it except possibly a few hazy clouds. Mrs. Smith said the object appeared to be steadily moving in a southeasterly direction.
"The driving was very brightly lighted," she told us. "The thing seemed to have all of its lights on full bright. It was not making the least noise that I could hear at all and it seemed to just float across the sky like a big billboard." 
Before reading further, she asked us: "Do you people believe in flying saucers? Well, I do now, because I saw it with my own eyes!"
Most of the people in Shelbyville who saw the object gave a similar account. A high school youth, described as a "straight-A" student, said he watched it as he drove to school.
"I stopped the car," he said, "walked across the road and stared at it. To me it appeared to be a Cadillac or some big deluxe automobile about 25 feet in diameter, with a sort of orange-yellow glow running completely around the upper part of it. It had no wings or anything that I could see protruding from it. It made no noise at all as it glided by southeastward."
The young man said the object was elongated flying light, and he was so amazed that he didn't even think of getting a camera to take a picture.
"For an unexplained flying object, there was little if any movement to it," he declared. "It just seemed to float along in one direction."
Years ago, he had read of the bevyair-filled balloons lost and now and found years later, the type that have a light green color and seem to hover motionless for great distances. But this was nothing like that, he said.
"For a' minutes be stared, then the object definitely seemed to accelerate - not gradually but in a sudden burst of speed. Then it was gone. 
There were no other lights in sight as it disappeared in the distance."
The sky was still dark. At that time of morning it was something resembling a cloud. But this gave every appearance of being entirely a reflection from the sun, motion-less and eerily silent.
As he drove along U.S. 80, he met another car whose driver had slowed down to watch the same phenomenon. They stopped and discussed it briefly, he said, but there was little they could say except that they had both seen the same thing.

The object, according to various eyewitness accounts, was first sighted in the vicinity of Shelbyville at about 6:30 a.m. Just over two hours later a power failure leaving most of the city in darkness. Just before this time the object was reported in the vicinity of Shelbyville's sub-station.
For a few days residents of Shelbyville reported to the newspapers and radio stations that the sighting of the peculiar object in the sky. Many were described as "skeptical" until they saw the object for themselves.

NEWS RELEASE

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

AIR PROVING GROUND CENTER 
EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, FLORIDA

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NO. 67-28
CHEMICAL LAUNCHES CONTINUE

EGLIN AFB, FLA., JAN. 17--A chemically produced vapor cloud was visible within a 300 mile radius of Eglin AFB Monday evening due to the second day's third high altitude research smoke test launched from the Air-Space Launch Facility on Santa Rosa Island.

The second launch of the day took place at 5:13 p.m. (C.S.T.), followed by a third at 6 p.m. The final two launches are scheduled to take place late Wednesday afternoon.

Both launches Monday evening were very successful according to Mr. Marshall Cartledge, Space Systems Branch of the Aircraft and Missile Test Division, Air Proving Ground Center. The launch vehicle, a two stage Nike-Iroquois, contained a vaporized barium payload which was released at an altitude of 100 nautical miles.

Mr. Cartledge said the cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field. The cloud drifted in a northeasterly direction and was visible for 30 minutes.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book containing a proposed reply to a letter regarding several unidentified flying object sightings. The text has been provided as follows:

Proposed reply to letter from Mrs. Gerald Greenlief, 26 January 1967

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Reference your letter of 26 January 1967 concerning several unidentified flying object sightings by your husband and other individuals on those successive nights. Our office has received several reports of a bluish-green cloud on the morning of 16 June 1966. These reports were from Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and now Kentucky. A detailed investigation into the matter revealed that Eglin AFB, Florida was engaged in an upper atmosphere research study at the time of the sighting. A two-stage Nike-Iroquois rocket which contained a vaporized barium payload was launched at approximately 0543 CST 16 January 1967. At an altitude of approximately 100 miles, the barium payload was injected. This produced an enormous green vapor cloud which was visible for several hundred miles. The Public Information Office at Eglin informed our office that this cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field and was visible for approximately 30 minutes.

The description in the news clipping you provided is quite similar to those we have already received concerning the 16 January 1967 early morning observation. Upper atmospheric research studies with sounding rockets have been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

As for the other sightings I can offer no comments without additional information. If you and your husband would complete the [redacted] 22 Feb 67.
