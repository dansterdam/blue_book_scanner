k. Information Officer: It is the opinion of the preparing officer that comments made by the observers contacted were made in an authentic manner and possibly they did see something. However, after the first three reports were brought to his attention, he observed the sky the evening of 21 Jun 65 for several hours and saw no strange objects.

Both the Weather Bureau and the FAA were contacted and no information was received to substantiate the authenticity of the existence of such objects described by the observers at the time they were reportedly seen.

1. None.

M/R: Tgt Moody took call from Maj Garvar at Pittsburgh, Pa on 22 Jun 65 at 1425 hours.

His phone on Autovin is 231-1895 ext 310. He has received a couple of reports, three persons saw object Sunday night and one person saw object last night (20&21Jun65).

Usually he can identify these reports but hasn't yet/ Called for a little advice.

He related part of the stories over the phone but Sgt Moody didn't know what it was from the following information: One Observer (Don Martin, from FAA and reliable) White object, straight overhead, looking straight up at it. One person said the size was half a pea held at arms length, other said size of half dollar held at arms length. Observers were separated by several miles. Object stationary for fifteen minutes, during later part it dispersed bodies, they ran away and went back in. Received first reports yesterday. Hasn't been able to get in contact with all of the observers as yet. Said the defense sector from Detroit was going to get a little into the act, when there F-102's go up tonight they will be looking for objects. Maj Guirat said he didn't imagine they would see anything. He will send his report in letter form as soon as completed.

M/R 27 July 1965 Called Maj Garvan regarding size and position of objects in relation to each other. He indicated that the smaller objects were laterally and below main object and were smaller. Keyhole was on Radio and was having trouble with multiple reports. Flap going on. Situation under control. Does not forward the "identified" such as satellite. Known e/o. Gave him Sara's f/a in case he has problems with the press. Will send in the data requested when he gets it.
