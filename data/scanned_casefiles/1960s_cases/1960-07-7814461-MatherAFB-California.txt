10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Flashing object with no definite body except it seemed to have a fuselage. When viewed thru binoculars it appeared to have an 8 to 12 petal shape. These petals formed by very bright rays of light. Color when flashing was white. Object traveled at a very high rate of speed and disappeared over a neighbor's house.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[Note: Some text is partially illegible or obscured]

• [First line appears partially illegible]

• COLLECT WAS VISUALLY AT AFT ELEVATION 150 TO

• PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS

• VIEW OF SIGHTING - 2/4 A LIGHT SIGHTING 2 MILE NORTH

[A section is blacked out/redacted]

• CONCLUSION: A MILITARY AIR TRAFFIC IN AREA

• [Last few lines are mostly illegible]

The bottom right of the page shows the page number "41".

The document appears to be a UFO sighting report from Mather AFB in California, based on the filename context provided.

[Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality. Only a few characters and fragments can be partially discerned, but not enough to confidently reconstruct full sentences or paragraphs.]

There is a handwritten note in the top right corner that appears to read "v 42" and "3 JLW", but this is not completely certain due to the image resolution.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location Mather AFB, California

Date 2 July 60                   Hour (Z) 0017    ( Twilight )

WX clear, vis 15 4, winds NW & SW, at 10 to 35 knots

Description Flashing object with no definite body except when first seen it seemed to have a fuselage. When seen through binoct it appeared to have a 8 to 12 petal shaped object, the petals formed by very bright rays of light.

Size of object was compared to flashing beacon on A/C at 2500 ft elev ( over )

Direction of Motion Southwest

Satellites: (AFCIN-483, Phone 69219) Ruled out - could not be seen at this time of day

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Duration excessive for meteor, too fast for star or fixed planet

Radar Analysis (A: CIN-4E1)                None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)    ------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.   Fitzkraft

Other                Reflection

Evaluation of Source Reliability   Possible

Analysis and Conclusions: The object at first appeared to have a fuselage. The sun had set 25 minutes prior to time of sighting, therefore there was light begin of daylit at remaining. There was both military and civilian craft in the area at the time. Therefore, the witness probably saw the sun reflecting off of one of these craft.

first seen due east of observer. Waspp behind a house in the SSW. Object

moved at a very high rate of speed on a steady SW course. Was seen about 5

minutes.
