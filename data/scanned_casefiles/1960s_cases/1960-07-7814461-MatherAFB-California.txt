PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 3 Jul 60
2. LOCATION: Mather AFB, California
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1530L
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: G Yes M No
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 min
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: ONE
9. COURSE: SW
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Flashing object with no definite body except it seemed to have a pin-like point. These details formed by very bright rays. Object traveled at very high speed and disappeared over horizon in a very short time. Witnesses probably saw the sun reflecting off an aircraft.
11. COMMENTS: Witnesses probably saw the sun reflecting off as an aircraft.
12. CONCLUSIONS: M Was Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
M Was Astronomical
Probably Astronomical

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a typed document, likely a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

NEARLY 2 WEEKS AGO CONTACT WAS VISUAL FOR APPROX 15-20 MIN AT A BRIGHT LIGHT OBJECT HOVERED DIRECTLY OVER MATHER AFB, CALIFORNIA. OBJECT APPEARED CIRCULAR AND APPROX 1.5 TIMES THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON. IT MADE SEVERAL ABRUPT MOVES AND CHANGES IN DIRECTION. OBJECT WAS VIEWED BY SEVERAL MILITARY AND CIVILIAN WITNESSES. 
OBJECT APPEARED SILVER AND METALLIC IN COLOR AND SEEMED TO EMIT A GREENISH GLOW.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Mather AFB, California
Date: 2 July 60
Time: 20:45 to 21:00 (PDT)
Weather: Wind 5-7, west to NW 15 to 25 knots
Description: Flashing object with no definite body except when it seemed to have a fuselage, when seen through haze it appeared to have a fuselage. 8 to 12 petal shaped object, the petals formed by very bright rays of light.
Size of object was compared to flashing beacon on A/C at 2500 ft elev (over)
Direction of Motion: Southwest
Satellites: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) - could not be seen at this time of day
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Duration excessive for meteor, too fast for star or planet
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): None
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: IFFKWXYT
Other: Refraction
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Poss reli b-2

Analysis and Conclusions: The object at first appeared to have a fuselage. The flight path and motion was fast, erratic, and at times hovering for periods. There was no sound or trail of any kind. The observers probably saw the sun refraction off of some object.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly an old UFO report from Project Blue Book. 

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

on a almost amost at a distance of 4 to 5 miles. when flashing color was white.
first seen the east of observer. lhamp behind a house in the ssw object
moved at a very high rate of speed on a steady sw course. was seen about 5
minutes.
