Dear Sir:

On August 12, 1966 I wrote you a very short and short letter asking if your Rad received a report on my August 9, 1966 UFO sighting. This observation consisted to two vehicles in outer space. This space morning, also something that I will make, forgot and am on my way. Only trying to contact the people that really don't want to talk. This my frustration here.

On Sep. 16, 1968 then again I was in a vehicle and then again in second vehicle, possibly to this run. I believe the two vehicle movement, that I would that August 9, 1966 was on that run of what I was. I have just completed.

I feel a great deal better now, because this thing has been bugging me now, since Aug. 9, 1966.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Very truly yours

Seen over Mass Rt #22 and Mass Rt #111 interchanges.

Note: Isn't + flying into a rainstorm an effective way of dodging radar?

Also, sighting only about 5 miles from U.S. Army Post, Ft. Devens.

Altitude can be determined from weather Bureau data on height of clouds during the storm.

Dear Sir:

Due to the fact that I can not fill out this questionnaire specifying the specific points that you are interested in, I'm going to write another letter, stating the facts as I feel they should be stated.

On August 9 1966 I was in my background looking for satellites and UFO's. I was approx. 9:00 to 9:00 o'clock PM. The time was after sunset. I was clear and 3 miles were a lot of stars, slowly. I thought I saw a object of stellar appearance moving out of the direction of the north or maybe south. I was too far to write from my background to the point that I might see it. I was able to see it clearly. I was off the light of the object. I had near the first two or three on object on the west leg. I was doing and I told him that I thought that star on

The text in the image is largely illegible due to the handwritten nature of the document and the low contrast of the scan. The document appears to be a hand-drawn map or sketch with directional arrows, compass directions (N, S, E, W), and various annotations. However, the specific details of the text cannot be clearly read or transcribed with confidence.

At the bottom of the page, there is a faint line of text that seems to read something like "...to south...", but the full context is unclear.

The document looks like it could be a sketch related to a location or an incident, possibly part of a UFO report given the context you provided, but the specifics cannot be determined from this scan.

We can't really know the day O saw it was important. They don't really believe me. O guess they don't see in U.S. O's can't do much to write to Hynek. I didn't know where to send it. O probably never would have reported it to this info. O hardly got after this type of magazines. (Look of this and such away because it was fast.)

On #5, about how far away it was... O can't really tell. From a certain view from the field by the park light own del Mt. Hood here. O heard some 10 miles away from this. So it probably landed near or got right there. O could show up that it's hard to explain.

Like tried to find a picture of it. Will. O magazines but haven't been able to find what I want. Benda well within (cent) quite right but no one will (get any)

Believe me so you're (the U.F.O. building) are the only ends that will give probable hope. Believe me. The only end I know is that I have done it is me & my sister. It seems like people say they believe in U.F.O.'s but when you tell them about seein' one then... they don't believe ya.

I hope after reading this that you will come out with a solution. Then please find a solution. Then please write back, because I would like to find out what you think about it. So please let me know - okay?

One more thing. I would've taken a picture of it if I'd had a camera even tho it probably would've been all blurry.

Well, thank you for reading this. I know it's probably taken up some of your valuable time, but I really appreciate it. Thanks again.

23 August 1966

Intelligence Officer
Project Bluebook
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

On the date, 11 August 1966 at approximately 2200, strange object was sighted by myself in this vicinity. Considered the object strange for the following reasons:

1. The object's shape was unknown to me and it was flying without wing lights, tail or head lights. (It had no wings as such.)

2. The object was flying under the cloud cover of a very severe thunderstorm (which had a severe tornado in it) and it was not affected at all by the very high velocity winds which are present in such a storm.

3. This complex shape was visible in spite of the very adverse weather. (It was disc in shape, see below.)

The above plus my knowledge of aircraft gained from Civil Air Patrol made me sure that this object was nothing that we would send aloft, especially in that severe weather.

Below you will find the exact details of the sighting and the object to the best of my knowledge.

Shape: See diagram
Color: Disc-white amber Center-gray amber
Size: A little less than the wingspan of a Boei 727 (rough approximation).
Speed: Approximately 600 to 700 mph ground speed.
Misc: It made a perfect 55 degree turn, a perfect curve mathematically, unaffected by any weather conditions.

Also it seemed to attract a very large lightning bolt.
While the lightning bolt temporarily blinded me, the object was not affected at all.

Location: Sighting was made on Mass. Rt.#2 near Lunenburg at the Rt. junction with Mass. Rt. #111. The object came across Rt.#2 at this point, then made its turn and continued along Rt.#2 west heading west. It went out of sight at approximately the position of Ft. Devens.

I hope that the above information has been helpful to you. I will be glad to answer any questions that I am able. If positive identification can be made, I would appreciate knowing the type of aircraft.

Thank you for your consideration,

[Signature redacted]

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high
was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high it was
above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the
path when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B"
at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.

Background Information on UFO Sighting by Mrs [redacted]

Reference the UFO sighting by [redacted] in August 1966. A study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the actual stimulus for her observation. Due to the late receipt of the information, it is not possible, at this time, to make a comprehensive investigation of air activity since records are normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful check of satellite schedules.

No direct correlation can be established between the buzzing sound and the observance of the alleged UFO.

We are not in a position to advise Mrs [redacted] on shooting a UFO; however, it would be wise if she consulted law enforcement officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out that many UFOs have been determined to be aircraft. There is a federal law against firing at airborne aircraft.

The photos of the flying saucers taken by two boys in St. Paul was shown on Television by news commentator Robert Ryan who broadcasted the news from Station K. S. T. P. Channel 5. I'm sure he knows where to get the negative. This K. S. T. P. Television station is on the city limits where Minneapolis & St. Paul come together on University Avenue. The object I saw went very fast I know by seeing that match is it. I'd also saw a fireball go right thru my window here in Minneapolis. It flew in, rung my bugger and backed out, did not break the window. I talked to an airplane pilot who said me he had seen a fireball on the tail of his plane many times.

Background information on UFO sighting by Mrs.

Dear Mrs.
This is in complete and investigation of your
UFO sighting in August 1966. A
study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the
actual stimulus for observation. Due to the late receipt of
the information, it is not possible at this time to make a
comprehensive investigation of air activity since records are
normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In
addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful
check of satellite schedules.

No direct correlation can be established between the buzzing
sound and the observance of the alleged UFO.

We are not in a position to advise on shooting a
UFO; however, it would be wise to consult law enforcement
officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out
that many UFOs have been determined to be aircraft and that is a
federal law against firing at aircraft.

Dear Sirs;

My name is [blacked out]
I am 14 years old and am in the ninth grade. On Sunday August 14, 1966, at 2:10 AM (Central Standard Time) at my home in Pensacola (see map) I and a friend [blacked out] on [blacked out] Drive, Pensacola, Fla. 32604) saw six(6) flying objects which we believe to be unidentifiable. I saw them for (approx.) 1 minute and 30 seconds. We had been bicycle riding and were sitting in my driveway talking.

Suddenly he [blacked out] looked up and saw them first. I looked at them then! I thought [rest of text partially illegible]

they look like U.F.O.'s! (I really
had this part sounds fake,
but tell it is really what he said,
we had both been in rest of
U.F.O.'s, but until then I had
never seen them with ghosts and
mind reading; possible, but
highly improbable.) I then turned
around and leaned back against
the front of our station wagon.
What I saw is illustrated in
the sketch enclosed, and I will
try to describe it clearly.

There were six objects,
sort shaped like the sky, an
elongated form 40. I saw an

with one in the center. (See sketch)
Each object was solid, sharply
defined and about the color of a
light strip, by which I could
see that they were rotating. (Clockwise)
They appeared about the size of an

would estimate that they were
approximately 1½ to 3 miles from me.
There was a wind from the
southeast at about 8 miles/hr.
Their elevation was about
50 to 55 degrees about an imaginary
horizon. At first I thought that they
might be parachutes at the nearby
Clyton Field Militar Helo Base as
they were in that general
direction. However, I realized then
that they were acting very
peculiarly for parachutes.
First they were perfectly steady,
rather odd for a parachute in the
wind. They also kept that
perfect "V" formation (with one
in the center) and that appeared to
be nothing hanging below them.
They were not glistening, nor was the
lower edge telescoped. (Somewhat
unusual for a bunch of parachutes, no?)

The conditions were very
good and visibility was high.
That was the view, I already mentioned.

As I watched, they (lights
first and lower) suddenly
wanted to seem nearer faster.
I was into the house to find
my field glasses after
calling to them. I could not find the glasses,
and when I returned the objects
were gone. According to Ray, they
drifted so low that the pine trees
in our yard hid them, so he ran
around in back of a neighbor's house
to see if he could spot them.
He couldn't, but on his return to the
front yard, they were in the exact
(same place) position as before.
Then said again behind the
pine trees as they had before, and
either landed or took off with a
burst of speed. Because I could
not find them again, I returned.

This replies to your letter requesting information on your observation of August 1966.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Dear Sirs:

I am reading a book about project blue book and I find it most interesting. I am in a pretty wild school and in the class room that I am in we all are U.F.O. lovers even as our teacher. One girl and five others saw an unusual event take place on the outskirts of town. There is a lake called Pike lake and while they were looking over the lake they saw a unusually looking object hover over the lake and somewhat like a tube so over the lake and such was it. I do not know no.

An unusual event happened to me the summer of 1966 at 9: 45 in Aug. I was lying in bed when all of a sudden I saw a strange round object shape stop so I could see it through my window at first I thought it might be what they call a harvest moon. Then I went into the family room to see if my thought was right. It was not however because the moon was in the south and the object was in the north. Then I found that my dog was paralyzed and could not move a bit. All of a sudden back lines appeared and a red light appeared. Then the lines disappeared, the dog could move. Then it went away. Ever since then my dog has had attacks. The next morning I told my mom she said I was dreaming. But I was not I swear I was not! What it was I do not know and I will never forget it!!!

Proposed reply to letter from [blacked out] May 26, 1967

Dear [blacked out]:

This replies to your recent letter of May 26, 1967 in which you report your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible on your sighting of August 1966.

It is important for an individual to report his observation to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible. This enables the base UFO investigator to perform a detailed on-the-spot investigation.

Normally, air activity records are destroyed after thirty days; thus, at this late date we would be unable to check for any air activity at the time of your sighting. We will add your information to the present data base.

They all came together and then split up. I saw again. They were red, blue, and white. There were a few flying over head. They were about 5-6 feet in diameter. We saw one coming down in a semi-circular motion.

Date and time of sighting: Second week of August 1966, AROUND 8:00 P.M. (Dusk)

Location of sighting: Environmental Factors: Clear, warm, twilight, some stars visible, no information on other factors.

Total time, local impossible to estimate accuracy can be to the eyes of the witnesses.

Narrative: (90 transcript, by journalist interviewing witnesses)

Positioning: Near northwest through an opening in a lower wooded area, the lights of section of town were visible. The two children (Christine, age 10, and Bobby, age 25 ____) were under some fire trees. Half father was in the house and father was in the yard. Unidentified Aerial Object (UFO) "said" it looked like a great big star and I knew it went a star cause it was too big. Started calling lights "then I heard over the hill a "swish" noise. It got closer and it would tell them not to get too close. It would come toward the children. (How sound, how loud) About 3 or 4 cars loud. I read in the house, told my daddy and then watched out the window. (Mr. Johnson called to understand the importance of delay excitement and did not go outside until his other two children rushed in saying "Look out the sky is falling".)

Then said "We were playing with our dogs in the yard and Gene yelled that some over there soon would be hurt." (From a star or so at approximately 50 or 55 degrees.) (And you could see the size or top and you could see the whole thing.) Yes. (Oh I think you will find it was a little.) (She looked a slight tilt to the north.) (How high was it?) About 8 feet higher than the house. (How much higher?) About 8 feet though. (How much space is the sky did it fall on compared with the clouds about 1 quarter more than those clouds.) I looked larger than our barn really. It was real bright.

Bobby Dale said "I was come under the trees mostly around with my dog and I looked up and saw a big star (indicated about a 45 degree angle east) and watched it. It was so close to it got so it was great big. I thought it would come. The whole house and barn too. (How big was it?) About 3 times larger than a star. (Indicated tilt toward west.) (How large was it?) About the distance from here to a most house. Several images from several (Do many) were seen. (How many?) About 3 or 4. (How far away?) About 100 yards. (How did my dogs were working and making such a racket."

were round and they curved down like that. They just opened up slow like wings. They had lights on them too, only they were kind of different lights. Kings square like you know, Tom was first. Some were all colors just like them up here only they were
lighter and some darker. Some kind of funny purple. (It wasn't a reflection you were seeing on the doors) We in positive it looked like that. (That drawing you made is that now big they were) well CLARK COUNTY, MASS. Then they finally guessed they might be almost as big as two barn doors.)

Then Bobby Dale said* And a big beam shot down. (Color) kind of a whitish orange. And it went down north of town. Well those were real close. (As it flashed on you could see the beam of it all the way) well mostly all the way but there was the trees and I couldn't see all of it. (You see the way the beam was) and of the beam coming down it went to the ground of anything) Yes but just to the hills. (But you are trying to tell me that when you first saw this thing come over the hill) Yes. (And you saw it clearly) Yes. (And you saw it come down) Yes. (And it was clearing, and I heard the dogs barking and turned to see what they were doing then I saw in something like a dark hill. I mean (fix location) like a mountain. (How far was it) It was about 30 seconds. Then it came back and it had that object in it. (How fast did it come) Well, oh 45 degrees. (How fast was the beam) About the same. (About how bright was it while the beam was down there) Are you positive or think maybe? Is positive. (How much did it brighten up that portion you could see) Oh. You couldn't tell, it was just like they were coming on and on they had been on a minute or so. When they just got bright, yeah. Then when it isn't they (get closer to where they were before. (Did you see anything in the beam when it flashed down there) Yes perhaps. (When this dark object came back in the beam did the beam stay steady and the object. Right back in it or did the edge of the beam come back) well it looked just like the edge of the beam just a nice sharp edge. (And this talking was in the edge of it as best I can tell) Yes, just looked like you had a helicopter and looked on to a station wagon or something, and just took it right on up. (what shape was the object. Well, because I was under the trees. (Didn't look like a van or anything did it) well, no it looked like some kind of ---- car or something. (I have heard of some fantastic sightings but this is about the most. You are not imagining you. It would be a terrible thing to tell me anything you don't see.) No not me. It wasn't like a close encounter (them) well it looked like there were four wheels. (Now this is a question where you are to reply) Positively. When anyone looks at it (this anyone is them) well it looked like there were four wheels. (Now this is a question where you are to reply) Positively. I said it looked like a car, I am getting mixed up now he etc. (It was bigger out farther in the beam but yes it was down some) Is got a little. (How big was it somewhere near to the beam was it floating along now. Was it rising or falling or what) It looked just like it was straggling still on the track. (How big was it) Oh the car was coming us backwards and slowed to the speed of a floating cloud when it hovered the UAO.

Time's description--- (How this light did you see it come down) Yes and it got bigger as it went down. (Where did it go to) well towards town. (Did it hit the town) well I looked and it looked like it was going right straight down in the center of town. It looked like the beam of light) Are you positive or did it look like it was coming up, (How this came this way down the beam) Yes and it changed this to the lights of the town) And when the beam of light went out. (more later perhaps) (Are you sure) Positively. (Are you more of that) Yes in positive. And then after that it went real slow and then I saw this described with Bobby Dale said it was something horrible it was. I thought maybe it was the season of the year. (Did this happen in summer) Yes. (When did this occur) (some time in July) And it was not sure you did say so) Is are i did. (Bobby Dale had originally mixed it a bit) And then added. And I chose said. I was going back and I took it as a matter of death. (Are you sure you are not imagining any of this.) I am not imagining none of it. It really looked like a car to me, yes it did, and Bobby Dale said it was like a big light when it

was going up. as it got further to the object it got smaller. looked real small then.
(Did it go inside) Yes it went inside the thing. (It was Tim who first thought she had seen
four were on the dark object)(Are you positive that seen four wheels on the object or
not. remember you can always say I don't know or I think maybe if you are not sure.)
Well I saw a dark shadow like a car and it looked like there were four wheels on it.
(She also later remembered that the beam continued on & the door was more or less narrow.
Bobby Dale couldn't say.)
THE OCCUPANTS-

Bobby Dale did not see the things in it from his vantage point and also say have been
occupied at that moment something what had happened to his car. (Then said I was very
interested in it, it was all clear glass. (What made you think that) well cause I looked at
it. I looked like glass, and I looked back and it was real black glass. (Could you see thru
it) Yes I was looking thru (the bottom and I kinda went back and I could see right through
the dome and was very up on top. (In was turning, did you see anything at me in it)
There was something looking out at me. (Brother Bobby Dale evidenced total disgust at this.)
That the truth Bobby Dale, it is really is a hard call. (Then after from notes comes
there my wife was talking to present- Time F-Wright was telling that man a bunch of lies.)
( No - Let me see on F.I. where these wild tales.) I was not looking, I mean
something dark and that is all I could describe it. It was dark looking out. (Asked father
if he had heard anything like this before. Pursant to my best informed of me am
everything but a-r and now tale.) Well it was just like as with head swaders and arm. (How
much did you see where did it cut his off at.) (She insisted the lower chest.) well it was
dark and I couldn't describe it really. But it was just like its had a nose and everything.
But I could see it far enough down that it looked like a human being, only it was smokey.
It looked kind of eerie. (Are making off your own conclusion.) No it is just kind
like a kind of eerie. Sassy and eerie, that's the honest truth. (He not
likely to put aside. (And from seeing from said on its face) There was something on its
face I can't describe. I haven't seen anything like it in the whole world. (You see the eyes or
anything) well I looked at his head and I could see two eyes but I really couldn't. They
were red, real little you know and they were real bright red. And they were real little things.
(Then did you notice this thing in there.) Yes soon as he looked closed I saw something look
out. (You said it had red eyes) Yes, I took off running. (You soon saw two shoulders and two arms.
That was all.) Yes, I think I can say that. (Then she came back to make the statement holding
their arms like- (They) Yes, there was two of them in there. (I thought you only said
one.) That's the three was two looking. They looked like their arms were a little shorter about
like that. They were dark and seemed to half to death. (To Bobby Dale,- You never seen all
this? No answer.) Does your sister tell many stories? (Is answer- Oh some told me all.)
I know of.)

(Than stopped me at 16 seconds.) (Now watch you these beings, how much did you
appeared, will show from the head to the chest.) (Indicates that some people.) (Did
they ever look over at you or anything) (Now you said the last time I was out here that
they were both holding their arms out. You know for some reason I show you will know
they were both holding their arms out, and some reason I show you will know that I
was one looked around, but I was other one looked like this. And I thought it looked
shorter than the other one. (You thought but couldn't say positively) (No, (You mean they didn't
hold them out like this, you said one time they pointed to Cannersville) (Yes they look like
this. (You said they held their arms like this, so now could on tail if they didn't reach
out like this or something) I don't know the best might have said one back here in this.
(So you couldn't say for sure) I can't say for sure no. (How did they move when they moved)
well, I couldn't tell.) (So far, left.) (In other words, like when (The shape of
their heads was it the same size as sure) (Yes only they were shaped different. Although,
Emma like - well, some said - I mean that one had a kind we will recall pointed. They were
a little pointeder than the. (You thought their faces were more pointed - one or both) (One
seemed.) (You said if you don't know - say well I don't know) I don't know. (I put your
time - maybe, you will always tell me that.) (If you don't know don't say that is the way it was.)
(I did you see could see well enough to tell) (Well I couldn't tell, they were far enough that
I could see their body but I couldn't see mouth nose hair etc.) (Good, I didn't think you could
see those things up there then.) (You said they were some gears or noise something)
(Yes came you describe that to me) well they passed between just like the, I dare say in
in the bridge) On the side there - you know there's a thing in lot in space) New cases
thing did you see them from the side, back or what some time or what) (Well back,
you know - no, I'm getting all confused, well anyway - (Take your time) You know they were,
I mean, well I came and they were, well as if I saw first from how, that they located
like they were passing in things and switching different things like that. (You didn't see
anything - the same kind of thing some back and verifying before you seen these back,
these things went it) Yes. (You didn't see them walk the beam out or coming back) (Yeh uh
I just saw them when, well in looking like the car up in the beam, then I saw them
to the window.) (She guessed it was about a minute after its doors closed) (You see them come
over to the side) Yes. ( You said you saw something before of or a lot can you couldn't
describe) well it looked like, well they had a mark on or something. Something like that
that was, (You are not much the other) (No as I (Inaudible you are seen, thought you seen
a nose on one of these last time I was out here) (No I don't. Yes I did too. I thought well it,
the same that had a mark on it looked like yes know, he was.) (Yes it was. (Take that after
one and he looked like it. ( Did you see red eyes in both of them) Yes both. (Gee you tell
me everything more about them that I haven't asked you) (No, (From nowhere- Did it was
had a mood on their head of any kind, You know like a creaking apparatus over specimen wear,
did it look like there was something over their head.) (Yes that is what it looked like.
(Yes on one or both) (Both) (And you seem the one saying that) (Yes it was
kind over in there like that, it looked like. But I could see the red eyes. (But where did
you get this red eye part) (In the rear of the or where) well I don't know if it would have
been a reflection what (She heard me mention this) out if did look like they were ruff
you know. (They didn't seem) No. (They never did look over at you or anything like this)
No I don't think they ever saw me. (During a phone conversation this said she thought both
were the same size in height. Said one was talking, and that both in the conversation
faces than ours.) (Do you swear on your oath that you are not making any of this up or
imagining any of this you now.) Yes I swear.

DEPARTURE OF THE SAUCER-

(And Johnny Dale said * all right before the craft started to leave, he was on
kind of wobble. He fell off a line out of the tree. He fell on his side (On his side, as
didn't land on him first) with a. You know he came back he said a sore hip. And he acted
kinds funny like it was having a stroke and fall, give ones running away. He ran over in a
field and didn't come back till 9:30 a.m. (If work or dogs were out he said like a little
bit sore I didn't see it for the moment and it was one a possibility and one it.
(Then said I'll just move on, real quick.) (Couldn't move on it disappeared. I watched it real
close and then it just disappeared. I'll watch it still move and then just disappeared.
(You said you thought you heard a noise) (Yes a real high pitched sound.
You it was just a real high pitched sound.

EMOTIONAL REACTIONS---
(when you see a terrible thing like that way didn't you run in the house) (scared) Yes, but we wanted to see what would happen. Tina. ( But you were so close, you
seen things with the red eyes etc) Tina-VI got behind Bobby Dale and looked, I was
scared. ( Ch did Bobby Dale come up and join---Tina) "I got scared and sort of ran
back and he came and ran up to meet me"--Tina. Bobby Dale - " Yes when it was leaving,
Tina she started to run the house and she fell. (How she didn't want to sleep upstairs
in bed) Bobby Dale- " That was my sister Gale." (She were not afraid you two) Tina- " I got
bed with Gale and put my head under the cover. I know I did that when I got to thinking
about them I got in bed with Gale and put my head under the cover. My heart started pounding
and I had a crazy feeling and I got real scared and then when I started to run in and it
started to disappear. Gale was scared and ran in before it was all over with and wouldn't
sleep upstairs that night at all." Bobby Dale said: "Oh it didn't make me bad cause I didn't
see what Tina did. If I had seen what she did I wouldn't bring my head out of the covers for
what a week. After we came in I had a headache and Tina had one too. I did because of the
dogs or maybe that high pitch or whatever you call it. Mom gave me an aspirin. It would have
been our nerves."
VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS---
The State Police, City Police and Sheriff were queried concerning missing and never
recovered autos, or persons missing while traveling through the area. The results were negatively. However the operational here was not the best and something could have
possibly been missed. A telephone survey of 17 homes in the area also failed to locate any
missing vehicles. Even the bottling gas plant on the highway was checked. It has tanks on
wheels and is in a possible direct line of the beam.

SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, TENTATIVE SPECULATION, AND POSSIBLE CONCLUSIONS.---
Our little witnesses (one year older at time of interview) extensive questioning
during two separate intervals and the recording of most of their statements can rove
beyond doubt that this is a very real, strongly sized in their minds event. That the three
together could say told a 11 or more completely and lights as impossible, and quite
beyond their ability at present. Since the little witnesses were not rising than possibly
it will be said that they were imagining things. In other words apparently hallucinated. This
amount of hallucination by three persons simultaneously would be impossible since
hallucination is the final stage of severe mental disorder. Our witnesses had no mental
difficulties before or after the event.

However a study of tapes, statements off tape and on phone indicates that our loveable
witness Tina is unreliable on details.
A. First said compass tracks and later said they looked out. And last said they
did not look out or see her.
B. First said one except another shorter than the other. Later said both same height.
C. Changed statements about objects tilt, beam lighting city, and delayed mentioning second
compass.
D. Seemed confused on face shape, masks, and arms.
E. Grew red and grew larger walking up on object. Later said two red lights.
Bobby Dale seemed much more reliable on details.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? N/A
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    17th   August   1966
                                                      Day     Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

As it is call, after I saw the satellite, I checked the local satellite spotting reports (737-8855) and since they reported no objects in the area for the time that I spotted it, I immediately called Andrews Air Force, Base Ops, OX-7-1201, and gave them my report.

The main difference between this sighting and other known satellites that I have seen was the fact that it was fainter (less bright), possibly even higher in the sky and that it disappeared I reappeared about three or four times as it descended towards the horizon, although it continued to move in the same course it did maintained from the moment I first saw it until it disappeared over the horizon.

As stated above, I don't remember the approximate time that I made this sighting, but I gave the approximate time to the officer who interviewed me when I called.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   9    Sept    1966
                                                   Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

A last, perhaps, a helpful note. My earlier sighting to Base Ops at Andrews A.F.B. + west track outside + sat down on the patio + was only there several minutes when disposed the above described altitude pattern. I was just generally certain that it was a satellite moving across the sky, went over + rang my patio bell. This brought the reply, only next door neighbor Mrs. [blacked out], and two or three of my own children. As I recall Mrs. [blacked out] also saw this second satellite. (She is out of town not present) + don't plan any of my children (they are in school) now saw the satellite. While I was trying to show them where they could see it, it was slightly off delta + would normally disappear over the path that it was going. I did not look for it in any other section of the sky. Then went back into my house + called Base Ops at Andrews A.F.B. + reported this second sighting. Another officer (a Major, as I recall) took this report from me. He remarked that there were no known American satellites going from west to east, so we speculated about what it might have sighted a Russian satellite.

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio-45433
ATTENTION: Major Quintanilla, Jay Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Dear Major Quintanilla,

Thank you for your letter of 8/8/66 with enclosure.
Also, kindly forgive me for taking two months to reply to
same. When I received your letter it was overladen with
work little in my occupation + in some do-it-yourself
projects at home. In addition, I was keenly interested in
the effects of the Baltimore Orioles (same rate Baltimore)
to clinch the American League Pennant and, at the same time,
the Pro-Football season was just getting under way - so that
between and between I have had very little time to concentrate
on anything else.

Further, since I had made + reported two separate satellite
sightings on 3 Aug. 1966 + you did not specify which one
you were interested in; and, even more, since I had made
a UFO sighting on 21 July 1966, which I thought you
should be more interested in, I decided to submit
separate reports on each.

Accordingly, I took the liberty of duplicating the form
you sent me from enclosing the three separate reports.

The two sightings of 3 Aug. & 21 July 1966 were definitely satellite; while
the 21 July 1966 lighting was a UFO.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]

*Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
Little pertinent experience except possibly 20 years residence in Kodiak, Alaska which is located on the outskirts of a U.S. Naval Base. The main mode of travel in Alaska is also by air. Twenty years of observing Naval, Commercial and Bush maneuvers under all sorts of conditions.
My husband and I are non-drinkers, non-partiers, and are not given to seeing odd objects at 4:30 in the morning.
Until August 7th, we took all the publicity on UFO's in stride and with tongue in cheek. Nothing we had ever seen prior to that moment explained the object that we saw.

33. When and where did you report that you had seen the object?

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. If possible, place "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. This had to be two lights of a single unit as they never varied in position to each other.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The information contained in this report is taken partly from memory and partly from a full report that I typed out immediately after the sighting while the incident was fresh in my memory.

We were awakened early in the morning of August 7th by the frantic barking of our house dog. I lay in bed for several minutes not wanting to get up, but the barking had been so urgent that some sort of investigation seemed necessary. Our dog is not given to night-time barking. The following is copied from my notes written at the time:

Two lights caught my eye from the kitchen window. They were intense, with definite outlines (no glow or haze), and they were the colorless, white intensity of the blaze from an arc welder's torch. The one to the right was larger than the one to the left and they were arranged parallel to the ground. Darkness and distance made it impossible to see anything but the lights and the stars and it made it impossible, too, to judge size or distance. It was light enough outside to see the dark outline of the immediate hills and trees, but not the mountain range (Cascades) in the background. It was plain even at a glance that the lights were where no lights should be. I moved back and forth to rule out the possibility of its being a reflection, though it was much too vivid and clear for that. The light remained stationary.

The color, the position, the absolute immobility as the lights raised suspended in space, the density of the light produced an eerie sensation and I called my husband. The time now was 4:40 A.M. Daylight Savings.

No flying saucer story would be complete without a drifting cloud, and, true to form, one drifted in and over the lights at a few minutes after five o'clock (perhaps 5:04). During the app. 24 minutes that we watched the lights did not move. However, or flicker. It simply hung there in the sky.

When the cloud covered the lights my husband returned to his bed with the remark that "You'll not see that again." However, my wonderment far outweighed my desire for more sleep and I stood at the window scanning the edges of the cloud for another hour before I saw the same deal rising.

above the edge of the cloud. It (the lights) was farther
away, but the lights were still in the same relation to
each other and still glowed with the distinctive intensity
that was different from any of the surrounding stars. It
headed up and out--all the way out. The sky was setting
light, the sun was coming up, all the clouds were a vivid
pink, the stars had all blinked out and the smaller or
the two lights disappeared before the larger finally grew
too small for me to follow. Up and out it went until it
was too small to see. The second sighting lasted 15-20 Min.
If I had not remained there to watch the exit of the
lights, I might now be able to talk myself out of the whole
thing. Perhaps it was a mirage due to reflected light
rays, bending an image of Venus and exaggerating it.
Perhaps it was a reflection of something catching the rays
of the rising sun. As soon as the unbelievable is out
of sight, it is easy to start rationalizing--to make the
experience fit the known, the familiar. But I watched
the thing out of sight and it was a climbing light at a
angle, but heading out all the time and it was heading
out into the sky at a much more rapid rate than the sun was
rising. Too, all the stars were turned out with the
rising light of the sun, but these two lights shown with
a similar vividness until they were too far in the distance to be seen. The light of the rising sun never did
dim.

I'm still quoting from my notes taken at the time: "We
didn't call Paine Field, we have read enough about the
opinion carried by the Air Force toward competition from
other planets. It is acceptable knowledge that we can
shoot our craft into outer space, but unthinkable that outer
space might be shooting a few back. When Don (my husband)
got to the grocery store (ours) about 9:30 Sunday morning,
he called the Marysville police and was answered with a
pleasant chuckle and the information that no other reports
had been received. We made no further effort to report
the incident."

Several of our customers admitted seeing the same object
during the next few days conversation.

My husband's brother, E. E. Bellevue, Washington, saw the same two lights in the same
relationship to each other from the Sea-Tac airport, which
is located half way between Seattle and Tacoma, probably
a distance of sixty miles from here, and at the same hour
that we saw it.

A helicopter (perhaps from Paine Field) circled this
area about 6:30, some ten minutes after the lights disap-
peared in the distance.

Gentlemen:

Yesterday a delegation of police officials and newspaper reporters from Pucallpa, came to our radio laboratory with the remains of an apparatus that had fallen from the sky. Apparently it came down about August 7, because there have been rumors of a UFO since that date. It fell about ten miles north of Pucallpa on the edge of lake Yarinacocha.

Children had further damaged the pieces before they were recovered by the police. There was a transparent plastic balloon about eight feet tall and three feet in diameter. Three were three electronic circuit boards; one covered with solar cells, the other two with transistors, resistors, diodes, and capacitors. The Transistors appeared to be made in the US, possibly by General Electric. The number El 154 B 25 appeared on the circuit boards.

We assured them that this was no doubt a weather observation balloon which had strayed from the US, after being sent aloft. The circuits must be a low power transmitter to relay weather data to a ground station.

If you have any way of determining the place and date of the launching of this balloon, I'm sure our neighbors in Icalllpa would like to know. We want to do everything possible to prevent false rumors and speculation.

Respectfully Yours,
J. Wesley Swauger
Supt. of Radio Dept.

FROM    : Amembassy RIO DE JANEIRO         DATE: October 28, 1966
SUBJECT : UFO sighting in the State of Sergipe, October 8, 1966

REF     :

1. The Consulates of Salvador, Bahia, forwarded to the Office of the Scientific Attaché a clipping from the local newspaper Diário de Aracaju, dated October 9, 1966, providing details of a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sighting near Capela. Capela is located north of Aracaju, Sergipe, a little west of a line between Propriá on the São Francisco River and Aracaju.

2. A summary of the reporting is as follows: In the evening of Oct. 8, at 10:30 p.m., various citizens of Capela sighted a luminous object in the sky in the form of a saucer, which seemed to rotate around its own axis, moving rapidly from one side of the sky to other and changing colors abruptly. One observer stated that the size of the object was like a full moon, showing sometimes a beautiful blue coloration, and perfectly visible during approximately 20 minutes. Another observer stated that he first thought that the object was a meteorological balloon, but this proved wrong when he saw that it was constantly changing color, remaining most of the time in the same place, with periodical movements from one side to the other. Still another observer stated that the object showed shadows of blue, sky blue and silver of extraordinary beauty, disappearing after about half an hour.

3. The Department may wish to bring the above to the attention of the University of Colorado study group, as well as to USAF.

Gentlemen:

At 11:10 on the night of August 8, 1966, near Shaftsbury, Vt., I sighted an object of the first magnitude near the zenith. It was moving somewhat erratically - seemingly with a wobble, and by fits and starts - yet in a generally fixed direction. At 11:20, after gradually losing brilliance, it faded entirely from view by the naked eye about 15 degrees above the N by NE horizon.

Could you please tell me what this object was, or if not, could you tell me if you had other reports of it?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,

Your letter of November 14, 1966 to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base concerning your two observations was referred to this office for reply.

I honestly believe that individuals must witness an unusual phenomenon or else they would not take the time and trouble to report the observations. There is no lying or withholding of information by the Air Force in regards to the U.S problem; this is a major misconception that has plagued the project for years. The Blue Book files are open to bona fide newsmen and solicitors. The availability of these documents has been taken advantage of by many persons in these fields, none of whom have challenged Air Force statements of the facts contained in them. The rare occasion-prone writers, however, have not chosen to review our files.

I want to stress that the Air Force finds itself involved with only subjective data. The only information on which to make a scientific study is that of an observer's own experience or interpretation of an experience. In no case has there been an instance where sightings have furnished scientific data and technological data that could be channeled to Research and Development for their study and utilization. UFOs exist in reports only.

There has been no conclusive evidence that our planet is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.

In regards to your observations, the lapse of time involved before reporting the sightings to the Air Force precludes a comprehensive evaluation. The information will most certainly be added to the present data base.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force. I hope you find the enclosed material interesting.

Nov. 14, 1966

Dear Sirs:

Enclosed are two copies of reports which I filed with NICAP. Aware of your official policy in regards to UFO reporting, I did not intend to notify you of my sightings. However, upon reflection, I decided that your official policy and your policy of action may differ. I send to believe now that you are seriously interested in UFO reports and that anything I can contribute may be of value to you. I don't care to receive an answer from you, which would be doubtful anyway. I am sure the only kind of response you would make regardless of the accuracy of the report would be one of ridicule or some asinine attempt to explain them as weather balloons, the planet Venus, or as an airplane.

I have often wondered if you are aware of the ridiculous position you have put the Air Force in by lying about various aspects of UFO sightings such as denying the fact that there has been radar tracking of UFO's. I am seriously concerned about your public position about UFO's and am hopeful that you will eventually release truthful information about them. Remember gentlemen, there is more than one way to lie - you can also do it by omission, or by playing with technicalities.

In case your first reaction to my report is one of doubt, let me say a word about Kenneth Arnold. I have been seriously interested in UFO's since 1947 when Kenneth Arnold spotted UFOS over the State of Washington. Up until about a year ago I always maintained an element of doubt about their actual existence. I have always wanted to see one but never let this interest turn desire into a sighting. Airlines have always turned out to be airplanes, planes remained planes. It took me 19 years to see something that firmly convinced me that in my way a UFO. So don't attempt to explain my sighting as wishful thinking. In any event, they are enclosed and I hope they will prove to be of some value to you - if only in the determination of world pattern of movement or interest.

Sincerely,
