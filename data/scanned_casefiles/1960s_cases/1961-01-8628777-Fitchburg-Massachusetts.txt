PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 16 Jan 61

2. LOCATION: Fitchburg, Massachusetts

3. DATE-TIME GROUP:
Local: 1704-302
GMT: 1704-302

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION:
R Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. PHOTOS: Yes

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 1/2 hrs

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 4

9. COURSE: 45°, 360°

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Main object appeared as large as dime at arm's length; three smaller objects appeared as sized. All four appeared round and bright silver or aluminum in color. Estimated altitude 20,000 to 25,000 ft. Appeared 45° elevation, 290° azimuth. Disappeared 45°, 360°. Larger object would appear to hover, with 3 smaller objects hanging back. Vee formation. One would approach, appear to close in, then drop back; then next would approach.

11. COMMENTS: Objects were sighted in area used by SAC on high altitude refueling. Maneuvers made by objects are very similar to those made by a/c just before, during, and after a refueling operation. Duration appears rather long; possible tanker refuel more than 3 a/c. When original witness went inside after watching first operation, no get other witnesses. First 3 a/c probably broke off and began to refuel. Second operation was probably one seen by other witnesses.

12. CONCLUSIONS: [Checkboxes mostly blank, but "Was Aircraft" appears to be checked under "Possibly Aircraft"]

Ltr, 3245th Ops Gp (CWOB), 24 Jan 61, Report of Unidentified Flying Objects
2nd Ind (CWOB)                                                    8 March 1961

by me.                 was personally interviewed 7 March 1951

2. He appears to be a sound and reliable citizens; a father of an airman stationed in Texas.

3. The amateur astronomer, M                , has moved and at present his whereabouts are unknown. Last information available was that he worked in Worcester, Mass., telephone number Pla             This number was called without success. No one knew of him at this number.

4. Reference paragraph 2, 1st Ind:

   a. Objects were under constant observation the first one and one-half hours, then Mr.             re-entered his store to call Mr.             (the amateur astrologer) and his son. Together they observed the four objects the remainder of the stated period.

   b. The main object appeared as large as a dime held at arm's length; while the three smaller objects appeared to be pea-sized. All four objects were round and bright silver or aluminum in color.

   c. The objects maneuvered in approximately a four foot square area from where the observation took place.

   d. From conversation and directions pointed out by Mr.             I find that his direction in both elevation and azimuth to be fairly accurate to within 5 degrees.

5. Further description of flight path and maneuvers were obtained.

6. The larger object would appear to hover with the three smaller objects hanging back in Vee formation. First one would approach, appear to close in, then drop back, then the next would approach in turn. Periodically the large object would dance wildly in the sky and circle back into position then all three smaller objects would back off again, one at a time. Suddenly the larger object shot off at a high rate of speed. In a matter of seconds covering 30 degrees of arc from the northwest toward north and disappeared. The other objects had disappeared when Mr.             looked for them after the disappearance of the larger object.
