While the text is somewhat faint and difficult to read, I can partially make out the following text:

Else Jan 64

Deford, Mich.

In answer to your letter concerning a appeal let me inform you that I never made an appeal in the contrary when I wrote to WBKB I stated that I would seek for my own antenna only wanted the truth which I never got only rumors about the sometrom. As to the makings of the planes I know that all planes are mysterious and private with etc.

Here is the text from the document:

to know that
I was know that
was not a private
job: I state to you
as I stated to M-ble
that was a U. S. G
or if you dont know
what U. S. G is a
flying saucer from
later space. My
daughter and I made
a bet that you would
not answer. If now
in your position I
would be more enable
about the whole
U. S. G business I
would be more truth
full about the whole
deal. One more matter

Here is the text from the document:

...what do you do about
the U. B. P. reports. bung
them under the rug
you must have a

glad to state that
we put up our
own antenna if we
had wanted on you
speedy joys. PR
would be without
a antenna now.
In case you are
interested we saw
two U. B. O's last
week. I'll define it

Here is the text from the document:

In a keep of your
mind and ideas they rest
