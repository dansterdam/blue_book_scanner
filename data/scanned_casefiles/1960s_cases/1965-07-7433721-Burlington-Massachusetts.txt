13 July 1965
BURLINGTON, MASS.
SAF 101

July 14, 1965

DST:

Dear Gentlemen, On the night of July 13, 1965 at 8:20 p.m. a mysterious object was flying around the night sky. My friend and I were camping out near a lake to the night sky for an early look. We were in a position to see the sky well. It was unusually quiet.

The local little town of Stow, Mass. Stringer would look about a day to take a night picture from here and I could tell there was a map of the day, it said that in Washington D.C. - you can get on #80 - could be a log part of the UFO's that were sighted over Washington D.C. on the night of August 13, 1952. Please if possible send then these reports to Thomas I like this topic UFO's. Thank you.

Sincerely yours
