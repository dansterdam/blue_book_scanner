To whom it may concern:

I receive a lot of rocks in the mail for identification and recently received this one from [redacted] of Gary, Minn. It apparently fell in his yard in September of '62. He says he has lived there for 8 years and the rock suddenly appeared in his yard. The chunk enclosed is about one-sixth the size of the chunk he found. He merely broke off a piece.

It was about the time the Russian Sputnik pieces were found in Wisconsin. I have had reports from people in our area who saw it break up so was wondering if some of it could have landed this far west. I would appreciate knowing the results of any test made on it.

Best wishes,
