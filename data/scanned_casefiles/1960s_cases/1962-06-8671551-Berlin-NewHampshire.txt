June 14- Two employees of Radio Station WBRL, Berlin, N. H. reported four yellow circular objects, sharply outlined and flying towards the Canadian border. They were asked not to rebroadcast this sighting by AF officials. No further information has yet been revealed on this UFO encounter.

MOTEL: NONE
INDIA: NONE
AIR
JULIET: EIGHT FORCE REPORTS THAT THERE WAS A MASS GAS REPELLING OPERATION WHICH COINCIDES IN LOCATION AND TIME OF THE SIGHTING. WEATHER BALLOONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FLOWN INTO THE AREA BY NORTHEAST WINDS.

KILO: LT STEPHEN GULA, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. THE OBSERVERS' REPORTS WERE LOGICAL, CONSISTENT AND COHERENT. VISIBILITY COULD HAVE BEEN WELL OVER TWENTY (20) MILES ON THE NIGHT OF THE SIGHTING AND COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE ABSENCE OF AUDIBLE SOUNDS.

THE LOCAL LICENSED (COMM) PILOTS AND THE STATION MANAGER OF THE BERLIN MUNICIPAL AIRPORT FELT THAT THE INCIDENT MIGHT BE UNUSUAL EXERCISES AND CONDUCT OF THE LATE ARCTIC AIR TRAFFIC OVER THE AREA. ANOTHER ASPECT COMMENTED ON BY SEEING YELLOW LIGHTS ON A DISTANT OBJECT DURING THE EVENING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THE REPORT IS CONSIDERED INTERESTING.
