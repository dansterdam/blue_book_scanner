PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 10 July 1962

2. LOCATION: Meredith, New Hampshire

3. TIME-TIME GROUP: 30 seconds

4. SOURCE: Civilian

5. PHOTOS: No

6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds

7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

8. COURSE: TX (Ground-Visual)

9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Observation at twilight for 30 seconds duration of obj that looked like a/c through TX except that it had a fin pointing in the opposite direction. Normally associated with the tail of an a/c. Looked like an a/c flying backward.

10. COMMENTS: Observation for short duration through telescope. Speed, performance and general description conform to an a/c sighting. Wings and tail surfaces vary with the direction of flight and degree of bank or turn. It is probably that the angle of the a/c presented this configuration to the observer.

11. CONCLUSIONS: Was Probably Aircraft

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
a match-head

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Nearly all of it

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It was low in declination and disappeared behind trees.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
A ball-pen with the clip reversed

DATE July 25, 1962

I had been preparing to observe Venus, and I was setting up my telescope when I noticed this. I immediately focused on the object, seeing it as I illustrated. I called my father, who also observed it. I started to call other persons to the scene, but the object had disappeared approximately 8:56 P.M. EDT. The moon was at first quarter and Venus was visible. There were few or no clouds, and the weather was warm and dry. There were few or no stars visible.

- page 8 -

21. It is impossible to estimate the size.
22. It was not round, but with the unaided eye, it was slightly smaller than a pea at arm's length.
23. The object disappeared from view when its path carried it behind a tree tail tree nearby.
24. If I were to construct it, I would use aluminum or magnesium, make it about 100 feet in length, and it would have the shape of a ball-pen with protrusion. A set of objects that would make it could be a ball pen with the pocket clip only bent completely back.
25. When I observed it, I was out of doors.

Dear Sir:

There are a few details on this sheet that I do not remember exactly, and I would recommend that you check as much of the sheet as possible,correcting it if necessary,with the letter which I sent to you shortly after having seen the object,for I have somewhat of the information,but the time (to be minute) and the exact bearing are unclear.(I think I have the date correct,however.)

Yours truly,
