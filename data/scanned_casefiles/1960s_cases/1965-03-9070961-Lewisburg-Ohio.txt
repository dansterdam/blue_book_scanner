1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 30 March 65 21/0300Z
2. LOCATION: Lewisburg, Ohio - Dayton, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10-15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary, 35 degrees
8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
9. CONCLUSION: 1. Astronomical (JUPITER), 2. AIRCRAFT

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The case details an observation of two objects over Lewisburg, Ohio, that were thought to be astronomical in nature, specifically the planet Jupiter. The investigating officer, Sgt. Jones, concluded that the objects were not necessarily unusual and likely reflected the position and refraction of Jupiter. The report mentions that consultation with Dr. Hynek led to the conclusion that the objects were inconsistent with a low angle of elevation in the sky, suggesting they were more likely aircraft. However, the report states that the objects "necessarily have to be a low angle of elevation in order to reflect the position and refraction of Jupiter."

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
March 9, 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is as follows:

At first it looked like a bright star at a great distance, but it was moving and its light was definitely reflected in the lake, like the moon usually is. When it came closer I could see that it was not a star, rather it was a large, irregularly shaped object. It seemed to be composed of a number of lights, some of them pulsating. It made no sound as it moved over the lake, and it proceeded at a very low altitude, perhaps 200 to 300 feet above the surface. When it was over the town it appeared to be a tremendous size. It would stop and hover, then move off in a different direction, then stop and hover again. All the lights did not seem to be on constantly, but would go on and off irregularly. Finally, it moved off slowly in the distance and seemed to disappear.

Dayton Ohio 
April 2, 1965

Dear Mrs. ____,
After reading of your reported UFO observation Tuesday night, March 30th, I am convinced that I also seen this object at approximately 10:00 PM. A passing glance from the corner of my eye to an extremely bright light. This was somewhat low in the sky, south of Dayton near Moraine City. First thought also was of an aircraft, with landing lights, but it did not move. After a short time I got binoculars and could see positively that it did not move and also was much more brilliant than any star. The light was somewhat oval shaped and distorted. Yet despite the perfect atmospheric conditions and I could not gain any idea of the distance. As I was watching the light went out just as if it was turned off by a switch. I watched briefly, and could not detect any beacon light similar to aircraft which I mentioned, passively, at the time to my wife that I thought I had seen a UFO, but gave it no more thought until I read the newspaper story of your experience. You may forward this letter to any investigative authority if you care to, and I will absolutely verify the information as I have described it. If you gain any information as to the explanation of this experience I would appreciate hearing of it.

Sincerely,
_____

At 1528, 31 Mar 65, Mrs. called from Rt 1, Box 210, Lewisburg, Ohio. She stated that at approximately 1520 she was looking out her front window and saw a bright object in the sky which was six or seven times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. It was stationary for about 5 minutes and then suddenly flickered and moved South as it moved rapidly backwards, all of a sudden appearing on the opposite side of the window, coming from the West was a plane. The object on the right of the plane was larger than the plane, looked through the South window for a couple of minutes, then reversed its course and headed North. She saw two streams of gold going up, looked like antennae as well as it was round.

At 1950, 1 Apr 65, Mrs._called from Lewisburg, Ohio called.
On the night of 30 Mar 65 her daughter, Mrs. , at 2200 was sitting in a chair looking Northeast. She first noticed a "hugh golden light" hanging in the sky. It was so bright she never saw anything like it before. It was a huge golden light, as bright as the sun, stayed at the same position for 3 to 4 minutes, then suddenly disappeared.

At 0930, 1 Apr 65, Mrs. called. On the night of 30 Mar 65 at approximately 10:30 PM her husband also saw the flying object moving North to South. He said the object coming North on a straight line, very bright, much brighter than the stars. Two large objects, one above the other and about 10-12 feet apart. They were slowly gliding and there was no sound. Two smaller objects near the large ones seemed to be slightly smaller than the ones on the horizon. Couldn't tell if they were on the same horizontal line, looked like a tower. It had to be miles away, it looked like 5 or 6 feet in diameter, much too bright to be a star. No plane, no clouds, no planes in the area. It seemed to disappear, looked like it might have been a tower, comparatively lower and perfectly lined up.

Dayton, Ohio

Women See "UFO" At Lewisburg
Lewisburg, Ohio - (UPI) - Mrs. Pauline Taylor, 53, and her daughter, Mrs. Dorothy Smith, 25, said they saw an unidentified flying object over Lewisburg Tuesday night. 
"It just couldn't be," said Mrs. Taylor. "But we saw it just the same."
The women said the object was larger than a regular airplane, about 60 feet long, and had bright lights on the front and rear. 
"The only way to measure it was that it seemed to be as long as the width of our house," Mrs. Smith said.
"There is a hill behind the house and the object seemed to be hovering over that, just above the treetops," she said.
"I couldn't believe it was a airplane because there were no motors and no wings," Mrs. Taylor said. "And it wasn't making any noise like an airplane either."
The women said the object remained in view for about five minutes before it disappeared from sight, moving toward the east.
"It was strange-looking object to be in the air, and I've never seen anything like it before," Mrs. Taylor said.
The Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigates UFO sightings, has been notified, the women said.

PROCEEDED to the US Weather Station at Sulphur Grove and interviewed Mr. who provided the wind data for their 1800 launch. This balloon rose to 98,000 ft and burst. It did not carry a light. Time of burst occurred at approximately 1930. (See attached Data) The balloon was 6.5 ft in diameter, white, expanding to about 26 ft at altitude of burst.)

Departed from UFO office at PTD for Base Operations to obtain local WX data. At 2200 on 30 March the winds were from 060 deg at 45 knots. Temperature was 30 deg-local wind data indicated that the winds at the launch area could have been over the Lewisburg area.

Information regarding balloons launched from this site in general revealed that the only launch that carries a light is the midnight (2400 local) launch. The light on this balloon is a white flashlight type of a light. The nearest other US Weather balloons launches are at Flint, Michigan, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Canton, Illinois. The average bursting altitude of the rawinsonde is 90,000 and the rate of climb between 750-800 ft per minute. The only time that this ascent is slowed is when ice forms on the balloons from the atmosphere. Under icing conditions the balloon may maintain the same altitude, fall or rise more slowly.

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing text describing an investigation into a sighting of unidentified objects in Lewisburg, Ohio on March 30, 1965.

From Sulphur Grove we proceeded to Lewisburg, arriving at about 1150. We had lunch and then went to the police station. From there a call was made to Mr Joe Tischer, Chief of Police of Lewisburg. Regarding the observation of unidentified objects on 30 Mar he revealed that he had been outside all night and did not see anything unusual. He carries binoculars. He had heard of no other reports from the area. He had not been contacted by anyone regarding this observation. 
As to Mrs James Jones, The knows her slightly. He has known her mother for 2-3 years and described her as "windier than hell", and feels that her report is just like Mrs Jones' mother to make up stories. He does not regard this type of report seriously. He has had one report of an Unidentified Object while Police Chief and this occurred two or three years ago. He looked at the object with binoculars and identified it as an F-100 with afterburner.
From Lewisburg we proceeded to the State Police Office at Greenville, Ohio. This office has jurisdiction for Preble county. Patrolman Don McCLee checked the State Police logs for the night of 30 March and no unidentified objects or unusual activities were reported. Patrolman McCLEE was on duty in Preble County (Lewisburg area) that night. Word of the Lewisburg observation did be passed to him when he comes on duty. A negative report will NOT be forwarded, however, if there were any reports of this nature or unusual observations by his or others he will call Major Quintanilla at Wright-Patterson and arrange for an interview if necessary.
From Greenville we proceeded to Lewisburg where an attempt to contact Mrs James Jones or Mrs Mary Jones was made. No answer on either exchange. From here we proceeded to the [redacted] (scene of the observation). Pictures of the house, lake and direction of observation were made, as well as the direction (reports) of the objects from beneath the window. A sure to the right of the initial observation was also photographed and directions in azimuth were made with a box pocket Compass Stock #6605-171-5121 (See Atch 2). PYD Form 164s were placed.

The --------- house is located about .2 mile from the ----------- across the road (ss).  mrs ------ advised that she had been called by mrs --------- on the night of 30 march and told that the object was above her barn.  she and her husband and son were unable to observe the object in the direction which they were looking (sw) and did not see the object.  she said that she had observed lights on several other occasions, but did not observe this one.  some of the objects she had observed were reported to the air force.

upon completion of the interview of mrs ------, we were turned to w-p aft arriving at the project office at 1545.

On 2 April 1965 called Dr J Allen Hynek regarding possible sunlight reflection from an unidentified object at 2200. The object was near 2200. At 2023 an object would have to be at an attitude of 200 miles to be in the sunlight. This eliminates the possibility of sunlight reflection on any object in the earth's atmosphere as the cause of the observation.

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 
15 April 1965

Dayton, Ohio 45433

On 16 April 1965 at approximately 9:30 p.m. EDT, an object was observed over the Lewisburg, Ohio area for a period of approximately one hour.

The object was described as round, glowing, and pulsating. It appeared to hover, then accelerate rapidly and disappear. It was observed by several persons.

It is the opinion of the observers, relative to sighting, that the object was not any conventional aircraft or astronomical object known to them.

We cannot determine the true identity of the object. If additional information is available which might assist in the investigation, please advise.

Sincerely,

Transcribing the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Answer: The object didn't disappear, it just got smaller and smaller and went out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
Answer: No

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
Answer: No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - It didn't make any sound
b. Color - It was white or silver, didn't change color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note, how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. This will give the angular size. How much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Answer: The object was small enough to be covered by a 1/2 inch match stick held at arm's length. The match stick covered about 1/4 of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with a trail behind it, moving in the direction of the arrow.
