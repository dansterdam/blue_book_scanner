See case file. Sgt Moody and Sgt Jones investigation (Field)
Color, shimmering effect inaccord w'th observation of Jupiter
Mr. ______ looking at a/c depicting to SE called Mrs ______ to
observe object over her farm (SE). Mrs ______ did not observe
an object (Looking in the wrong direction). Object was not
under continuous observation. Inversion in the area at
setting and refraction of Jupiter. Inversion in the area at
5,000 and 15,000 ft.

COMMENTS: Consultation with Dr Hynek led to conclusion that there
was sufficient evidence to evaluate the case as the setting of
Jupiter and an a/c observation. The 50 deg elevation and reflective
in the lake area incandescent. The object necessarily having to be
at a low angle of elevation in order to reflect from the lake. The
constant with this analysis. Jupiter setting coincides with the
disappearance of the first object.

At first it looked like a bright star but was male gold in color. It seemed to coming closer to earth. It reflected in the lakes, like the moon would, but no other stars reflected that night. It seemed to get brighter & brighter. I then it shimmered & something came out on it. It started moving very slowly left or south. It went out (the light) & came back on & then off again. I saw my daughter outside was gone. I ran to the south window & there it was just a spoke going east very very fast. It must have been very far away at this time according to its size.

Sgt Moody;

Received a collect call from Mrs [redacted] Lewisburg, Ohio

She said she received a letter from a Mr [redacted] telling her that he observed the same light on one night at 10 PM from his west window. She said that he stated in his letter that he looked at the orange light, though a pair of EX, and it was oval shape and looked like heat, and it was stationary and all at once the light went out. I asked her if we could have this letter and she said yes, and would send it out today along with her Form 164.

Dayton Ohio
April 2, 1965

Dear Mrs.
After reading of your reported UFO observation tuesday night, March 30, I am convincedthat I also seen this object at approximately 10:00 PM. A passing glance from the window immediately caught my eye to an extremely bright light. This was somewhat low in the sky, west of my home which is located south of Dayton, near Moraine City. First thought also was of an aircraft with landing lights, but it did not move. After a short time I got binoculars and could see positively that it did not move and was also much more brilliant than any star. The light was somewhat oval shaped and distorted as by beat or atmospheric conditions and I could not gain any idea of the distance. As I was watching, the light went out just as if it was turned off by a switch. I watched briefly, and could not detect any beacon light similar to an aircraft.

I mentioned, passively, at the time to my wife that I thought I had seen a UFO, but gave it no more thought until I read the newspaper story of you and your friends experience. You may forward this letter to any investigative authority if you care to, and I will absolutely verify the information as I have described it. If you gain any information as to the explanation of this experience I would appreciate hearing of it.

Sincerely;

At 1558, 31 Mar 65, Mrs. called from Rt 1, Box 240, Lewisburg, Ohio, phone at 2200. She was looking out the window, looking West, she saw a gold object in the sky which was six or seven times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. It was pretty large and had a antenna, reflection of obj showed on the water, appeared to have its own light, so brilliant watched it for about five minutes, suddenly flickered, moved South, as it moved it faded, at this time it appeared to be going backwards, all of a sudden it was completely gone out of sight. She then looked out the South window, coming from the West was a plane. The beacon was larger than the light she observed. She watched the light go East to Dayton, kept moving East, looked through the South window for a couple of minutes. Stars were visible, no moon. The object appeared to be over Johnsville and New Lebanon, at least that was the general direction. Looked gold and flickered. Antenna as tall as it was round. Two streams of gold going up, looked like television antenna, V shaped, like rabbit ears, they were watching other stars and it always stayed in the same position and then as it moved you could see the antenna.

At 1550, 1 Apr, Mrs. Ohio called.

On the night of 30 Mar 65 her daughter, at 2200 was sitting in a chair doing her homework, in a West window. "There was something in the sky I have never seen before". A great big golden light hanging in the sky. Never seen anything like it before. It was a huge golden gold light, a great big gold light, saw a plane go over high at the same time. My youngest daughter watched it for a couple of minutes, it flickered and disappeared.

At 0330, 1 Apr 65, Mrs. called. On the night of 30 Mar 65 approximately her husband also saw the flying object while driving in Oakwood, they were coming North on Sharer three south of the cemetery. As he was driving in the sky many very left above the ground. Too large to be stars, they were driving slowly and Mrs. looked and saw them both, we lost sight of it when passing houses, lights were both of gold tone and the upper seemed to be slightly smaller than the one on the horizon. Couldn't tell if there was any motion, we saw them for at least Â½ minute. Looked like a tower, it had to be miles away, it looked like 3 or 4 in diameter, much too bright to be a star, no planet in sky, it seemed brighter than Venus as its brightest. Did not see an a/c but saw two lights, looked like it might have been a tower, comparatively lower and perfectly lined up.

Women See
"UFO" At
Lewisburg
By William S. Rupprecht

"Just couldn't believe our eyes," was the way Mrs. Howard Wysong of Lewisburg described what she was reacting for an experienced UFO (unidentifying flying object) Wright-Patterson Air Base media officer, now here investigating.

It was about 10 p.m. when it materialized. Took action in a split second. It was big, Mrs. Howard Wysong said.

The two women watched the circular shape closely for several minutes. "We were told in conference five times bigger than a regular," it had an antenna on top and the length seemed to be equal to the circumference of the object.

"It was stationary as we watched. It looked toward us, then it started to fade in color as it moved away."

"Then, in a split second, it disappeared."

"We kept watching it for awhile and then saw it again in the distance, moving east toward Dayton."

Mrs. Wysong could not estimate its size or distance.

"The only way to measure it was in comparison to the stars. I would say it wasn't close, but we could see its reflection in the water," she added.

There is a lake behind the Wysong residence on RR 1, Sebring road.

She was sure it wasn't an airplane because "we saw an airplane passing with its red, rotating beacon light close by."

"I studied it to be sure," Mrs. Wysong said.

She also called a neighbor, Mrs. Mart Marti, who lives across the street.

Mrs. Mart had told me she saw two of them this year, or last year, and when I called her she said it sounded like the same object," Wysong said.

The 25-year-old witness said this was a new experience for her. She had never seen anything like it before.

Base officials had no other reports of the incident, they said. The Air Force's office for investigating UFO sightings in the U.S. is locally located here.

Proceeded to the US Weather Station at Sulphur Grove and interviewed Mr [redacted] who provided the wind data for their 1800 launch. This balloon rose to 98,000 Ft and burst. It did not carry a light. Time of burst occurred at approximately 1930. (See Attached Data) The balloon was a ravinsonde (6-8 ft diameter, white, expanding to about 28 ft at altitude of burst.)

Departed from UFO office at PTD for Base Operations to obtain local WX data. At 2200 on 30 March the winds were from 060 deg at 08 knots. Temperature was 30 deg. Local wind data indicated that the winds were such that a balloon from the Dayton area could have been over the Lewisburg area.

Information regarding balloons launched from this site in general revealed that the only launch that carries a light is the midnight (2400 local) launch. The light on this balloon is a white flashlight type of a light. The nearest other US WX Bureau launches are at Flint, Michigan, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania and Rantoul, Illinois. The average bursting altitude of the ravinsonde is 90,000 and the rate of climb between 750-800 ft per minute. The only time that this ascent is slowed is when ice forms on the balloons from the atmosphere. Under icing conditions the balloon may maintain the same altitude, fall or rise more slowly.

From Sulphur Grove we proceeded to Lewisburg, arriving at about 1150. We had lunch and then went to the Police Station. From there a call was made to Mr Joe Tucker, Chief of Police of Lewisburg. Regarding the observation of unidentified objects on 30 Mar he revealed that he had been outside all night and did not see anything unusual. He carries Binoculars. He had heard of no other reports from the area. He had not been contacted by anyone regarding this observation.

As to [redacted], he knows her slightly. He has known her mother for 2-3 years and described her as "nuttier than hell", and feels that her daughter is just like her. Chief Tucker retired from the Air Force in 1957 and does not regard this type of report seriously. He has had one report of an Unidentified Object while Police Chief and this occurred two or three years ago. He looked at the object with Binoculars and identified it as an F-100 with afterburner.

From Lewisburg we proceeded to the State Police Office at Greenville, Ohio. This office has jurisdiction for Preble county. Patrolman Don [redacted] checked the State Police logs for the night of 30 March and no unidentified objects or unusual activities were reported. Patrolman WEBER was on duty in Preble County (Lewisburg Area) on that night. Word of the [redacted] observation will be relayed to him when he comes on duty. A negative report will NOT be forwarded, however, if there were any reports of this nature or unusual observations by him or others he will call Major Quintanilla at Wright-Patterson and arrange for an interview if necessary.

From Greenville we proceeded to Lewisburg where an attempt to contact Mrs [redacted] or Mrs [redacted] was made. No answer on either exchange.

From here we proceeded to the [redacted] (scene of the observation). Pictures of the house, lake and direction of observation were made, as well as the direction (reported) of the object from beneath the windows. A tree to the right of the initial observation was also photographed and Directions in azimuth were made with a box Pocket Compass Stock #6605-171-5121 (See Atch 2). FTD Form 164s were placed.

in Mrs W*******mailbox with instructions for her and Mrs****** to complete the forms and forward them to our office in the envelopes provided.

We then went tothe house adjoining the*****arm and talked with Mrs Ray*******. Mrs******* and her daughter were aware of the sighting but had not observed anything unusual on the night of 30 March. Mrs******* then directed us to the Mart farmhouse. She stated that Mrs******* was probably at the hospital (Good Samaritan) with her husband who had recently been in an auto accident and was supposedly in critical condition.

The********, house is located about .2 mile from the*****arm across the road (SE). Mrs****** revealed that she had been called by Mrs******* on the night of 30 March and told that the object was just above her barn. She and her husband and son were unable to observe the object in the direction which they were looking (SW) and did not see the object. She said that she had observed lights on several other occasions, but did not observe this one. None of the objects she had observed were reported to the Air Force.

Upon completion of the interview of Mrs****** we returned to W-P AFB arriving at the Project Office at 1545.

INSERT #A:

The police station is in the same building with the Fire Station. Only City employees were at this location. A call was placed to the home of Police Chief Tucker. City employees informed us that Mrs****** husband had recently been in an auto accident and that Mrs****** was probably staying with their parents at the Wilkinson farm. This farm has a fishing lake and the house is fairly new. Directions to the****** farm were obtained from these officials.

On 2 April 1965 called Dr J Allen Rynck regarding possible sunlight reflection from a balloon. The end of Astronomical Twilight occurs at 2028 Local. The observation was near 2200. At 2028 an object would have to be at an altitude of 200 miles to be in the sunlight. This eliminates the possibility of sunlight reflection on any object in the earth's atmosphere as the cause of the observation.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, Set over stationary while investigating it and then started to move. At this, I did not get a good look in my rear view mirror then just disappeared. Did then reappeared in about 1/2 minute very off to the distance.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   NO   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
I moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   NO   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - We couldn't hear any sound because we were inside.
b. Color - Bright gold or yellow.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Compared to the largest planet Venus, the object, this object was about 6 to 7 times larger than the disc. Then some, the only way we could compare the size at that time.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

When the object was moving East it seemed very far away. It was about the size of a star at that time. There was an airplane, with a red flicker on the bottom, going West at the time the object was going East, and the object was going quite a bit faster than the airplane.

We thought that maybe the object saw the airplane coming, and was moving out of its way. Then the object was sinking out of sight glancing the like behind the farm.

I have talked with two other people who have seen objects at different times, but didn't report them. They also saw them in the Lewisburg area.

These were:
1. Mrs. [redacted]
   Lewisburg, Ohio

2. [redacted]
   Lewisburg, Ohio
