11. COMMENTS
The object responsible for this sighting
is the planet Jupiter. A haze layer was
probably responsible for the flickering
and changes in color. Jupiter was in the
location described by the witness, and
checks on subsequent nights indicated
that Jupiter was the probable cause.

Dear [redacted]

This will acknowledge your letter of 14 March 1961 in which you reported sighting an unidentified flying object last summer from 6 June through August.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore request you fill out the attached Air Force questionnaire in detail and forward the completed document to the Commander, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and/or evaluation.

Gentlemen:

I am writing to inform you of a sighting of an so-called unidentified flying object. We have a sighted this object near a number of times. It was some time ago, sighted by quite a few people. It was in white lights.

I believe - may have of 1960. The object was a large slow before or at sunset that was never before 150 C. There was a way of the object was sighted outside. From the surroundings, the space was visible. I was sighted inside these area. Not to explain the materiality. Also was not possible to determine the possible altitude was not able to find the true range of height. I was not able to determine its speed.

For as we have seen here a way. Observing time was of a foreground to a fire now was at certainly or a place. The sky was very

EVIDENCE OF SAUCER LANDING IN ENGLAND: Shortly before press time, an incident nearly identical to the one above was brought to our attention, by the London Unidentified Flying Object Research Organisation, of London, England. A farmer named Bill Edwards was walking through his pasture fields one day early last June, when he came across imprints in the ground which formed two concentric circles, the outer circle approximately 25 feet in diameter, and the inner one 16 feet across. The width of the imprints was 4 inches, and the grass at the edge of then showed indications of having been burned. The depth of the imprints was about 1 inch. Lending to the almost impossible conclusion that they were caused by some large heavy circular object which had-landed recently, and this fact was added to the evidence that the object which landed must have been very heavy. Indeed, the question is about a half mile from the nearest road, and no vehicle could have reached the spot without such signs. Edwards had been to the same spot only two days previously, and according to him there were definitely no circles visible then. The day previous to the discovery of the mysterious circles, Edwards and some helpers were working in a nearby field. They noticed nothing unusual that day, nor did any other local resident report anything unusual. Thus, this case is definitely one of the strangest on record.

NEWS BRIEFS: A mysterious aerial object was seen by several residents of Bermuda on the night of June 24th. It was bright in the center, like a star, and carried an aura of light around it. It also seemed to have lights like a searchlight, but made no sound. The UFO was arriving very fast.

On February 13, at Grand Blanc, Michigan: a greenish dome-topped disc-shaped UFO was photographed near the Moon by Restaurant Owner Joseph Perry. Similar objects were seen crossing the Moon from Tucson, Arizona on June 25 and confirmed at other localities also.

EVIDENCE OF SAUCER LANDING IN TENNESSEE: In a case somewhat similar
to several other in the past few years, a circle apparently on the
ground overnight - this time in the front yard of a home in Martin, Tennessee.
Miss Josephine Damron, who lives with her mother and brother near Martin, told
reporters that on the morning of June 20th she noticed what the first believed
to be sole markings in her yard. Upon closer examination, she saw that it
a perfect circle was 15 a circumference a black, grassy about six
eight inches in diameter. It looked a bit like oil, but when touched felt
like car grease. However, after drying out, the markings had a
"charred, sooty effect," according to the witnesses. The circle was measured
and found to be about 15 feet in diameter. Aside from this, no other
two other pale circles have appeared elsewhere in the vicinity of Martin, and
none have been explained.
