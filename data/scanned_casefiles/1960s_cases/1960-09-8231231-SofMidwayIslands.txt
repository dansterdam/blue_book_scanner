YOUR MSG AFCIN-8830Z AND ATIC MSG AFCIN-L82x IC-1,1681x. IT IS THE ATIC CONCLUSION THAT THE OBJ WITNESSED BY THE CREW OF A MILITARY AIRCRAFT AT 0700Z ON 26 SEP 60, WAS PROBABLY ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION OF THE STAR ARCTURUS. THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT POSITION 21-52N, 178-25W.

REFRACTION IS THE BENDING OF LIGHT AS IT ENTERS OR LEAVES A DENSER OR LESS DENSE MEDIUM. IMAGES (LIGHT) SEEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WILL SEEM TO TWINKLE, CHANGE BOTH COLOR AND INTENSITY, CHANGE SHAPE AND SIZE, AS WELL AS TO DANCE AROUND AND APPEAR TO RUSH TOWARD AND AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER. A SECONDARY EFFECT IS THAT OF DISPERSION, LIGHT OF DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS (COLOR) BENDS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES, THEREFORE THE OBJECTS ALL APPEAR MULTI-COLORED. WHEN THE SUN, MOON OR STARS ARE LOW ON THE HORIZON THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BENT BY THE ATMOSPHERE INTO A CURVED PATH WHICH RENDERS THESE OBJECTS VISIBLE

WHEN THEY ARE IN REALITY ABOUT ONE-HALF DEGREE BELOW THE HORIZON.

THE INCREASING DENSITY OF THE LOWER AIR CAUSES THE RAYS TO BEND.

THE STAR ARCTURUS WAS AT AN AZIMUTH WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THAT

REPORTED BY THE WITNESSES AND WOULD APPEAR ON OR JUST BELOW THE

HORIZON AT THEIR LATITUDE AT THE HOUR OF THE SIGHTING. THE

MAGNITUDE OF ARCTURUS IS 0.2, ONLY FIVE STARS; BETELGEUSE, CANOPUS,

SIRIUS, RIGEL KENTAURUS AND VEGA ARE BRIGHTER. THE MOTIONS

ATTRIBUTED TO THE OBJ ARE PROBABLY DUE TO APPARENT MOTIONS RESULT-

ING FROM INCONSISTENCIES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND RELATIVE MOTION

RESULTING FROM AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT. IT WOULD NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR

EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS TO BE FOOLED BY THIS PHENOMENA. SIMILAR

EXPERIENCES HAVE EVEN FOOLED QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMERS

FOR A LIMITED TIME.

FOR AFCIN. REF YOUR MSG AFCIN 88302, ONLY TWO SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENT-
FIED FLYING OBJECTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO ATIC FROM THE HAWAIIAN
AREA IN THE PAST 10 DAYS. ON 18 SEP 60, AT 1015Z AND POSITION
35-20N, 176-18W, AN ELLIPTICAL SHAPED OBJ THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL
WAS SIGHTED. THE OBJ LEFT A TRAIL AND WAS BRIGHT ORANGE IN COLOR.
WHEN FIRST SEEN THE OBJ WAS FIVE DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND
FOLLOWED A HORIZONTAL TRAJECTORY ON A COURSE OF APPROX 100 DEGREES.
THE OBJ WAS APPROX FIVE DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON WHEN IT DISAP-
PEARED. THE OBJ WAS IN SIGHT FR 20 TO 30 SECONDS. WITNESSES
REPORTED THAT THE SPEED OF THE OBJ APPEARED SLOWER THAN THE AVERAGE
METEOR. THIS SIGHTING WAS REPORTED BY THE CREW OF A NAVY AIRCRAFT.

ATIC ANALYZED THIS SIGHTING AS PROBABLY DUE TO THE OBSERVATION OF
A METEOR OF THE "FIREBALL" CLASS. THE DESCRIPTION BY THE WITNESSES

FITS THAT OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FIREBALL, EVEN TO THE RELATIVELY SLOW VELOCITY. FIREBALLS ARE CHARACTERISTICALLY SLOWER THAN THE ORDINARY METEOR AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THOSE SEEN IN THE EARLY EVENING, THE TIME THIS SIGHTING OCCURRED.

ON 26 SEP 60, AT 0700Z AND POSITION 21-52N, 178-25W, AN UFO WAS OBSERVED BY THE CREW OF A MILITARY AIRCRAFT. THE OBJ WAS RPTD AS ROUND OR OVAL IN SHAPE, SIX INCHES IN DIAMETER AT ARM'S LENGTH AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING FROM RED TO GREEN TO WHITE AND REPEATING THE CYCLE. EACH COLOR WOULD PERSIST FOR THREE TO FOUR SECONDS BEFORE CHANGING TO THE NEXT. THE LIGHT FROM THE OBJ WAS RPTD TO BE VERY BRIGHT. ONLY ONE OBJ WAS RPTD, BUT IT WAS OBSERVED SEVERAL TIMES.

THE OBJ LEFT NO TAIL OR TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND WHICH COULD BE DETECTED BY THE WITNESSES. WHEN THE OBJ WAS FIRST SIGHTED THE MISSION AIRCRAFT WAS IN A LEFT TURN, THE OBJ APPEARED TO CLIMB FROM WATER LEVEL AT THE EIGHT O'CLOCK POSITION, SPED PAST THE TAIL OF THE RPTG AIRCRAFT TO THE FIVE O'CLOCK POSITION WHERE IT WAS LOST FROM VIEW. WHEN NEXT THE OBJ WAS SEEN THE MISSION AIRCRAFT WAS LEVEL AT 15,000' ON A COURSE OF 210 DEGREES. THE OBJ WAS SIGHTED AT SIXTY DEGREES RELATIVE BEARING AT 40 DEGREES ELEVATION AND MOVING ACROSS THE NOSE TO A RELATIVE BEARING OF 330 DEGREES LOW. THE OBJ DISAPPEARED BEHIND A CLOUD BANK WITH TOPS AT 10,000'.

THE OBJ WAS OBSERVED FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES. THIS RPT ARRIVED AT ATIC ON 27 SEP 60, AND HAS NOT AS YET BEEN ANALYZED DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF ESSENTIAL INFO WHICH HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY PACAF. IN VIEW OF THE INFO WHICH IS AVAILABLE, THIS OBJ COULD POSSIBLY HAVE

BEEN A USSR MISSILE OR A STAR NEAR THE HORIZON WITH MOTION OF THE MISSION AIRCRAFT GIVING IT AN APPARENT MOTION. IF THIS OBJ WAS A MISSILE, AND THE RPTD INFO OF ITS FLIGHT PATH THUS, IT WAS PROBABLY FIRED FROM SOME SURFACE VESSEL. A LONG RANGE MISSILE WOULD HAVE HAD A PATH WHICH APPEARED MUCH STRAIGHTER AND IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO ORIGINATE AT A SPOT ABOVE THE HORIZON. HQ USAF WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE COMPLETE ATIC ANALYSIS IMMEDIATELY UPON ITS COMPLETION.
