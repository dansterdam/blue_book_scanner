ATIC CONCLUSION THAT THE OBJ WITNESSED BY THE CREW OF A MILITARY
AIRCRAFT AT 0700Z ON 26 SEP 60, WAS PROBABLY ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION
OF THE STAR ARCTURUS. THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT POSITION 21-52N, 179-22W.
REFRACTION IS THE BENDING OF LIGHT AS IT ENTERS OR LEAVES A DENSER
OR LESS DENSE MEDIUM. IMAGES (LIGHT) SEEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS
WILL SEEM TO TWINKLE, CHANGE BOTH COLOR AND INTENSITY, CHANGE SHAPE
AND SIZE, AS WELL AS TO DANCE AROUND AND APPEAR TO RUSH TOWARD AND
AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER. A SECONDARY EFFECT IS THAT OF DISPERSION,
LIGHT OF DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS (COLOR) BEND AT DIFFERENT ANGLES,
THEREFORE THE OBJ JETS ALL APPEAR MULTI-COLORED. WHEN THE SUN,
MOON OR STARS ARE LOW ON THE HORIZON THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BENT BY THE
ATMOSPHERE INTO A CURVED PATH WHICH RENDERS THESE OBJECTS VISIBLE

JOINT MESSAGEFORM - (C) INITIATION SHEET
SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
ATIG W-P AFB
WHEN THEY ARE IN REALITY ABOUT ONE-HALF DEGREE BELOW THE HORIZON - THE INCREASING DENSITY OF THE LOWER AIR CAUSES THE STAR ARCTURUS TO SEEM TO BE BELOW THE HORIZON ACCORDING TO THE WITNESSES AND WOULD APPEAR ON OR JUST BELOW THE HORIZON. THE MAGNITUDE OF ARCTURUS IS 0.2, ONLY FIVE STARS - BETELGEUSE, CANOPUS, SIRIUS, RIGEL KENTAURUS AND VEGA ARE BRIGHTER. THE MOTIONS ATTRIBUTED TO THE STAR ARE PROBABLY DUE TO ATMOSPHERIC MOTIONS RESULTING FROM INCONSISTENCIES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND RELATIVE MOTION RESULTING FROM AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT. IT WOULD NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS TO BE PUZZLED BY THIS PHENOMENA. SIMILAR EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN FOUND QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMERS FOR A LIMITED TIME.

ON 13 SEP 60, AT 1015Z AND POSITION 35-20N, 175-14W, AN ELLIPTICAL SHAPED OBJ THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL WAS SIGHTED. THE OBJ LEFT A TRAIL AND WAS BRIGHT ORANGE IN COLOR. WHEN FIRST SEEN THE OBJ WAS FIVE DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND FOLLOWED A HORIZONTAL TRAJECTORY FOR A COURSE OF APPROX 100 DEGREES. THE OBJ WAS APPROX FIVE DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON WHEN IT DISAPPEARED. THE OBJ WAS IN SIGHT FOR 20 TO 30 SECONDS. WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE SPEED OF THE OBJ APPEARED SLOWER THAN THE AVERAGE METEOR. THIS SIGHTING WAS REPORTED BY THE CREW OF A NAVY AIRCRAFT. ATIC ANALYZED THIS SIGHTING AS PROBABLY DUE TO THE OBSERVATION OF A METEOR. THIS DESCRIPTION IS THE SAME DESCRIPTION BY THE WITNESSES.

FITS THAT OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FIREBALL, EVEN TO THE RELATIVELY 
SLOW VELOCITY. FIREBALLS ARE CHARACTERISTICALLY SLOWER THAN THE
ORDINARY METEOR AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THOSE SEEN IN THE
EARLY EVENING, THE TIME THIS SIGHTING OCCURRED. 
ON 26 SEP 60, AT 0700Z AND POSITION 21-52N, 179-25W, AN UFO WAS
OBSERVED BY THE CREW OF A MILITARY AIRCRAFT. THE OBJ WAS RAPID AS
ROUND OR OVAL IN SHAPE, SIX INCHES IN DIAMETER AT ARM'S LENGTH AND 
CONTINUALLY CHANGING FROM RED TO GREEN TO WHITE AND REPEATING THE
CYCLE. EACH COLOR WOULD PERSIST FOR THREE TO FOUR SECONDS BEFORE
CHANGING TO THE NEXT. THE LIGHT FROM THE OBJ WAS USED TO BE VERY
BRIGHT. ONLY ONE OBJ WAS RPID, BUT IT WAS OBSERVED SEVERAL TIMES.
THE OBJ LEFT NO TAIL OR TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND WHICH COULD BE 
DETECTED BY THE WITNESSES. WHEN THE OBJ WAS FIRST SIGHTED THE
MISSION AIRCRAFT WAS IN A LEFT TURN. THE OBJ APPEARED TO CLIMB
FROM WATER LEVEL AT THE EIGHT O'CLOCK POSITION, SPEED PAST THE 
TAIL OF THE HPTO AIRCRAFT TO THE FIVE O'CLOCK POSITION WHERE IT WAS
LOST FROM VIEW. WHEN NEXT THE OBJ WAS SEEN THE MISSION AIRCRAFT 
WAS LEVEL AT 15,000' ON A COURSE OF 210 DEGREES. THE OBJ WAS
SIGHTED AT SIXTY DEGREES RELATIVE BEARING AT 10 DEGREES ELEVATION
AND MOVING ACROSS THE NOSE TO A RELATIVE BEARING OF 330 DEGREES
LOW. THE OBJ DISAPPEARED BEHIND A CLOUD BANK WITH TOPS AT 10,000'.
THE OBJ WAS OBSERVED FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES. THIS RPT ARRIVED
AT ATIC ON 27 SEP 60, AND HAS NOT AS YET BEEN ANALYZED DUE TO THE
ABSENCE OF ESSENTIAL DATA WHICH HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY 'DATA'. IN
VIEW OF THE INFO WHICH IS AVAILABLE, THIS OBJ COULD POSSIBLY HAVE

A LONG RANGE MISSILE WOULD HAVE HAD A PATH WHICH APPEARED SUCH STRAIGHTNESS AND IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO ORIGINATE AT A SPOT ABOVE THE HORIZON. HQ USAF WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE COMPLETE ATTIC ANALYSIS IMMEDIATELY UPON ITS COMPLETION.
