White glowing light. Object at first was a half moon in shape. Glowed and changed shape to oblong and not dimmer. Movement swinging back and forth. Size of a minute. No change in color, just dimmed and faded away.

11. COMMENTS
Witness located in suburb on Western edge of Dayton, therefore when looking to West towards city lights. The weather was cold, and the atmosphere was very light in the sky would appear odd to the ground observer if the source was at or near the horizon and at extreme distance. It is possible that the witness was really looking at the moon, which was a thin crescent at the position noted by the observer. The small movement attributed to: the warm and cold layers of air.

REPLY TO
ATTN: OT1   TD-8
SUBJECT:   UFO Sighting

TO: SAFOI-3F (Major Coleman)

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] reporting a UFO sighting made by them. For your information, also attached is a copy of the NICAP questionnaire on which Mr. [redacted] made report. This questionnaire leaves much to be desired as there are some important questions left unanswered. For this reason a wild conclusion cannot be made concerning the sightings.

Suggest your office contact Mr. [redacted] and ask him to forward the answers to the following questions to Foreign Technology Division, ATTN: TO-8:

a. In what direction were you moving at the time the object was sighted?

b. Was the object first sighted straight ahead, or was it a little off to the right or left?

c. What was the elevation of the object when first sighted? That is, was it halfway between the horizon and overhead, 1/3 of the way up from the horizon to overhead, etc.

d. Were the car windows down at the time?

2. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. [redacted] reporting this sighting of a UFO. A valid conclusion cannot be made from the limited information reported. Therefore, suggest your office send him an ATIC Form 164 for completion.

COPY

Dear Sirs,

While a short time ago sitting in my yard I saw two blue-white pulsating lights moving across the sky from east to west. At about 40 degrees of the horizon, I noticed one light and appended to temporarily and turned horizon red. Then made a sharp 180 degree turn, and headed again into the east.

Climbing red then made another sharp 90 degree turn and headed North still gliding Crimson. There was lighting in the south west and each time it flashed a silvery red cloud was seen instead of the red glow.

This took place in about 3 minutes first sighted around 9.P.m Thursday June 29 - 1961.

I am sure this was not a jet although one had just passed from North to South in the way. From the Unidentified Object I saw I heard no sound but I did have the roughly passed jet.

I am writing this letter in accordance with the air technical intelligence Command's issuing of a statement for reports of such matters.

Thank you.
