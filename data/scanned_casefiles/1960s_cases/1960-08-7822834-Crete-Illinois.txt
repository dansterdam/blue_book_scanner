Dear Sir:

I wish to report the sighting of an object which might be of interest to your group. At about 4:00 PM yesterday, August 29, Mr. [redacted] of Crete, Illinois, saw a gleaming chrome-like football-shaped object hovering over the ground. At the time of the sighting, he was driving north on Illinois route One, between Crete and Steger, Illinois. He observed the object through an open window and, as he approached it, it began to rise, accelerating until it was out of sight. Visibility was very good, but there may have been a few scattered clouds. The relative bearing of the object from him was probably NW and he observed it for something less than a minute, I would judge.

I am reporting this because Mr. [redacted] would probably not take the trouble. I would suspect that many sightings go unreported. He is a farmer in his sixties, not given to hallucinations, and only one other time in his life has seen anything which puzzled him so (as near as I saw a "fire ball" many years ago). He is not well-read in the subject of UFOs, and I would remark the validity of his having observed something.

He feels that the object was shining so brightly that there must have been others who saw it, and he is hesitating to tell many people. Should you desire further information, please contact Mr. [redacted] in Crete, Illinois.

Respectfully,
[Signature]
John T. Cleek
1st Lt. USAF

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
    a. Sound: None
    b. Color: Silvery Ling

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn circle with an upward arrow]

Note: the light from the object was so intense that it was difficult to determine its exact shape although it appeared spherical.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One)
    a. Fuzzy or blurred
    b. Like a bright star
    c. Sharply outlined
    d. Don't remember
    e. Other: [handwritten: Unclear]

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[A hand-drawn diagram with points O, 5, and A is present]

21. How long did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
Visible, Lasted 3-5 sec.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
7 or 8 times the angle subtended a paper match held at arm's length

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Object seemed rapidly disappearing overhead.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
Shaped like a sphere, shiny like chrome on the sun's reflection, like a glass or mirror.
