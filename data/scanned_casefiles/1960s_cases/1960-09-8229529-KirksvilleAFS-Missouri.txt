EVALUATION OF UFO (U)

1. Reference your memos dtd 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60.

2. ALL BLIPS AND LIGHTING OBSERVED ON RADAR STATION AND RANGE STATION WERE NOTED ON THE SAME RADAR EQUIPMENT. THIS EQUIPMENT IS QUITE POWERFUL AND SENSITIVE DETECTION INSTRUMENTATION.

3. TARGETS OBSERVED WERE STATIONARY, THEN EXHIBITED RAPID ACCELERATION AND HIGH SPEED BEFORE DISAPPEARANCE. ALONG WITH THE EXTREMELY RAPID MANEUVERABILITY, THIS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS WHICH WERE REPORTED.

4. IN NO INSTANCE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS OR MOTION PICTURES OBTAINED SINCE THE OBSERVATIONS WERE OF SUCH SHORT DURATION AND THE OBJECTS MOVED WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT CAMERA COULD NOT BE AIMED AND OPERATED IN TIME TO RECORD THE TARGETS.

SPECIAL REPORT NO. 13
THE INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
AT KIRKSVILLE AFS, MISSOURI
ON 8 SEPTEMBER 1960 
C-23 NUMBER: 17

LOCATION: KIRKSVILLE AIR FORCE STATION, MISSOURI
OBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT 

On 8 September 1960 at approximately 1935Z, the Radar Approach Control Officer at Kirksville Air Force Station observed an unidentified aerial object on the radar scope. The object first appeared to the northeast of the station at approximately 20 miles range, and was observed to close rapidly on the station, coming to within 3 miles range before passing to the southwest.

During the encounter the object exhibited the following characteristics:
1. It appeared as a well-defined target about twice the size of a normal aircraft target.
2. It approached the station at a high rate of speed, closing from 20 miles to 3 miles in a matter of seconds.
3. It exhibited no normal aircraft maneuverability, such as turns, climbs, or dives.
4. It disappeared from the radar scope rapidly after passing the station, indicating a high rate of speed.

NO VISUAL SIGHTING WAS REPORTED.
