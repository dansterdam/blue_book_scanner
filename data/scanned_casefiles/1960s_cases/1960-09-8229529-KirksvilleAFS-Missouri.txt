Evaluation of UFO (U)                                                4 Oct 60

AFCIN-422x

1.   Reference your memos dated 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60.

2.   All three radar sightings reported are from the same radar station and were noted on the same radar equipment. This equipment is quite powerful and occasionally picks up reflections from various weather situations such as is encountered when warm moist air is mixed with cold dry air. The appearance and disappearance of targets as a "report", along with the extremely fast changes in altitude, lends credence to the possibility that some form of weather condition was responsible for the unidentified targets which were reported.

3.   No reports of similar targets have been received from other stations in the area which might have confirmed or denied this explanation.

DISTRIBUTION OF 100 (5)

SUBJECT-MISC

1. Reference your memo dated 11 Jul 60 ACS 54 Aug 60.

2. All items listed hereinafter reported are now to have added visibility with respect to the local sightings. This headquarters has been locally alerted to a particular sighting in the Kirksville area which has a significant bearing on the investigation. Some of the details are sketchy, but it appears that changes in altitude, location, and velocity are consistent with the possibility of an unidentified aerial object. This report.

3. To support a similar request are being obtained from other stations and will forward when available light data collected by ground observation.
