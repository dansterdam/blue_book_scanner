4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
2 or 20 Minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The original report received from Ellington AFB did not contain sufficient data for proper evaluation. Therefore a Form 164 was sent to the observer for more information. The data obtained from the Form conflicted on several important points with the original report. For Example: On the original report, the time of the sighting was stated to be 06054H, but on the follow-up 164 was reported to be 0510AH. Also on the original report the duration of the sighting was reported to be 2 minutes but on the follow-up it was reported to be 20 minutes. Therefore this sighting has been evaluated as CONFLICTING DATA.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
Swooped, circled, darted

8. PHOTOS
□ Yes
■ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. The "object" came down from the west, missed a tree top at my back, then circled, came "spiraling down", seemed to slow at several hundred feet, my husband & me in the same pattern - when it reached the south side it turned "up" went due south.

This would have been impossible. The object was very large, possibly huge.

24.2 How fast were you moving? [blank] miles per hour.
24.3 Did you stop at any time while you were looking at the object?

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    26   Feb   1966
                                             Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Friday, Feb. 4, 1966, 5:10 A.M. Mr. [redacted] and I were in the Kitchen when we heard a terrific explosion. There was no vibration. We ran outside and faced a large object coming down from the west, seemingly to us. The noise cannot correctly be explained. I have heard such tornadoes and I think that kind of roar, plus other kinds, might be one explanation. The noise became "lighter" an take-off.

When I first saw it I thought a plane was on fire and the people would be burned. Then, it was directly overhead - just above the tree + light wires. I'm a "split second" made a complete circle and came back at us in the same pattern. That time I tried to see all I could. It looked like the body of a big airplane with no wings. It looked to be elongated, rolling in a dive downward. About 1/2 from the end or edge, was a big red portion, a HORRIBLE heat. More like a hot metal in a black-smith shop. We felt no heat even tho' it was near our heads. We believe someone was in it + probably took a picture of us. Since we were between it + the open lighted door.

On the second trip it "straightened" up and went due South with lights blinking on either side and back. It wobbled after take off. We could not estimate its speed. From time or explosion to disappearance, the time was about 20 minutes, no more, maybe less. The sky was clear and we saw a few stars.

I didn't think at the time the man "any dark and just before day-break". After it was out of sight I called the Houston Police and asked the officer if he would call Ellington and tell them an object was in the elements coming that way and to watch for it. He said he would. I have to pay for a long-distance call to Ellington, and I was not sure I would get the answer I partly wanted.

When I arrived at school at 8 A.M. Mrs. [redacted] told their story. I then called Sgt. Lennard. I have seen to Sgt. Lennard.

It's very hard to explain on paper, but I hope this

1. Earlier this year, 2d Lt Carson Marano started a project to determine which sightings might involve plasma and if there were similar weather conditions for these sightings. He received weather data about a month ago but did not have time, so work on it and will probably need a meteorologist to assist in interpreting the data. So, there is a slight delay in his project.

2. Enclosed are some of the cases that Lt Marano selected in the hope that you may be able to use the information. We will forward the rest of the cases when the work meteorological following is a listing of the inclosed cases.

Dear Sir:

This is a personal note concerning several points of interest to me, and I am interested in relating them to you.

Since I have been asked on the report sheet and also by the Ellington officer if I reported the incident, I feel, as I did at first, that this should be a military matter and should not be reported nationally. While I am not told to do so. But, if you have not seen, or do not know about the book "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" will be interested. The article on the objects is in the February 28, 1965 issue, page 36.

Our son, Capt. [redacted] is in the navy, in Yokohama, Japan. Of course, we should like to share our experience. With his connection, he can, but I felt perhaps U. S. had rather this information had not go out—see. I will not do this unless I'm told to do it. If you do not give me permission I shall keep quiet.

Sunday evening, in watching television, the program "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" student, we yelled: "There's that thing, just like it was here." I was told: "From now on, magazine report, and the reports of others, it is sure a picture of it. We have so many enemies it seems, we are wondering if the author of the story has a connection with the Russian scientists. If it does not belong to us, as some of our people really believe, surely someone responsible for the making of "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" should be investigated.

Sincerely,

P.S. I am a teacher at [redacted]

(Sec'n Chg Teacher)

Gave this report to me:

"I saw the object northwest of me. It looked to be large with a movement in a very irregular path. It was high in small lights. It seemed to be vibrating or wobbling up and down. Its color was yellowish or yellow-orange. Noise was that of a large diesel engine speeding, then idle--in a very irregular pattern. My husband and son also saw it."
