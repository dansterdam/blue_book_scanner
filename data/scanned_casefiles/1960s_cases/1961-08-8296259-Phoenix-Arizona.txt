12. COMMENTS
3 separate sightings, mostly based on size and shape to conform to balloon. However appeared to be particularly low and not rising. Remained in area an hour watching disappearance. Observed at several 2 hr period. Winds below 50,000 did not exceed 10 kt. Therefore no avid movement in direction would be noted. All observers indicated smoke coming fm obj. This and fact that obj did not rise rapidly are not explainable. Other indications to balloon release in preceding observation.

The following is forwarded in compliance with Air Force Regulations
200-2, 14 September 1959, and 200-2A, 2 February 1960. Attachment No. 1
is a diagram received from Mr. [redacted], as to what this object
appeared to be.

a. Description of Object:

(1) One group of observers reported the shape of the object was
oblong or elliptical, another group of observers reported the object to
be barrel shaped.

(2) Size of the object was reported by one group to be the size
of a twenty man life raft, estimated to be fifteen feet. The second
report assumed the same size and shape comparable to that of a fifty-five
gallon oil drum standing on its end, approximately five feet in diameter
and ten feet long.

(3) Reports of color varied from black to gray.

(4) One object was sighted.

(5) N/A.

(6) Observed as a clear outline of this elliptical or cylindrical
object with no windows. One observer reports that a foot above the cylindrical object, there appeared to be indentations around the circumference
of the bottom of the drum.

(7) Observers all agreed that smoke was seen and that from the
bottom center of the object a slight reddish glow was observed at the
same point that the smoke appeared to be coming from.

(8) No sound.

(9) No other pertinent or unusual features reported.

b. Description of Course of Object:

(1) A child was the first observer to call attention to the object.

(2) All reports agree that the elevation of this object was approximately 1000 to 1200 feet at a distance of a mile and one-half to two miles from the point of observation. One additional observer drove to the vicinity and looked up at the object and estimated that the altitude was 1000 to 1200 feet.

(3) No one observed the object disappear.

(4) Object appeared to be floating or drifting in a northeasterly direction.

(5) When object was last seen, it was drifting slowly in a north-easterly direction. No one observed object disappear.

(6) Majority of viewers estimated they watched the object for ten minutes, got tired and went into the house.

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground-visual.
(2) Two observers were using 7 by 35 power binoculars.
(3) N/A.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) First sighting: 0230Z, 2 August 1961. Second sighting: 0251Z, 2 August 1961. Third sighting: 0628Z, 2 August 1961.
(2) Light conditions: dusk.

e. Location of Observers:

f. Identifying Information on Observers:
(1) Civilian - Mr. age 46, Phoenix, Arizona, school teacher at, reliability unknown.

(2) Civilian - Mr. age 35, Phoenix, Arizona, unemployed, reliability unknown.

Here is the text from the document:

g. Weather and Winds - Aloft Conditions at Time and Place of Sightings:

(1) Observers account of weather conditions: fairly clear, dark and light clouds in the vicinity and distance. Occasional lightning from cloud to cloud and cloud to ground.

(2) Wind direction and velocity in degrees and knots:
6,000 ft - 340° at 10K
10,000 ft - 230° at 3K
16,000 ft - 150° at 10K
20,000 ft - 140° at 8K
30,000 ft - 150° at 9K
50,000 ft - 150° at 12K
80,000 ft - 080° at 35K

(3) Ceiling - general ceiling of high broken to high overcast between the hours of 0200Z and 0500Z hours.

(4) Visibility at 0200Z 40 +; at 0300Z 35 +; at 0400Z 15 +.

(5) Approximately 14,000 ft scattered sky condition with a high overcast, 35 mile visibility. Towering cumulus nimbus and frequent lightning cloud to ground, NW and NE, 5 and 5M point of sighting. Variable broken to overcast.

(6) Thunderstorms in the area of NW, NE and S to SW.

(7) Gradual temperature gradient decreasing from + 22°C at 6,000 ft to minus 67°C at 50,000 ft.

h. No other unusual activity or condition.

i. No interception or identification action taken.

j. The known air activity was at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Weather balloons were reported to have been flown in the preceding forty-eight hour period. As of this date, none of the balloons have been recovered.

Second report - Yuma Marine Corp Test Station reported the Army tested ten weather balloons between the hours of 1300 and 1800 hours, Tuesday, 1 August 1961, at one-half hour intervals. These balloons will expand to seven feet in diameter while some others may reach as much as forty feet in diameter. They are radio equipped and have parachute packages attached for jet action. They are released at ground level and have been known to fly at approximately 75,000 feet.

k. Preparing officer is [redacted], AO 612076, Assistant Base Operations Officer at Luke AFB. It is his belief that this sighted object could have been one of the balloons released by either Yuma or Fort Huachuca, which could have drifted over this area at high or medium altitude. Due to the atmospheric conditions, the time of day (dusk), the [rest of text cut off]

possibility of optical illusion coupled with untrained observers could
be the reason for the statements that the object was observed to be at
1000 to 1200 feet. The report of the slight fire and smoke coming from
the center of the drum-shaped object is unexplainable by the investigating
officer.
