March 28, 1969

Dear Sir:

Ordinarily, if I am a person who doesn't like solving UFO cases and has informed others in the parapsychology field that I am a debunker - a person who does not believe in UFOs and has a closed mind - I probably would not be writing to you. However, I have had a strange experience, and I feel a need to relate it to someone who specializes in UFO research and may be able to offer some helpful information.

On the night of March 2, 1969, at approximately 8:00 p.m., I was looking out my kitchen window and was attracted by a bright light in the southern sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was moving too slowly and steadily to be an aircraft. I observed it for several minutes, and it appeared to be a disc-shaped object, giving off a brilliant white light.

After a while, the light began to dim, and the object started to move upward at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. I am a fairly rational person, and I must admit that I was quite shaken by what I saw. I have no explanation for it, and I would appreciate any information you could provide about the case.

As a result of this sighting, I find myself with a changed attitude toward UFO research. I am now more open-minded and willing to look into the subject objectively. Please let me know if you would like me to provide any additional details about my experience.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]

fast and said that it was circling about a couple hundred yards into the air. The light gave the impression that it was shaped like a dome, but on the bottom there was an attachment that looked like a teardrop. It appeared to be a bright golden light on the top and on bottom a dull glow. There was a slight haze or mistiness across the middle of the object. It would make a simple diving or climbing motion across the sky, then stop suddenly. The object from when he saw it at first appeared to be the size of a dime held at arm's length. Its speed could only be described as phenomenal, going from east to west in a matter of seconds. He was confronted with a bright light on the road to watch the object, and said it was a little too bright to look at comfortably.

Described not of the might? the right my belief is, siting daucers traveling distance. It dard sighted my cousin not a distance and the daucers travel as at a and the distance to out a or more often miles only about a distance and as big pass the distance of vision and the elevation of the river bottom and as dipped in it. Did seen about 15 minutes. They and seems to be a decline was of the vehicle. Some one told me that my counity thinks but a nothing to excite that my counity thinks but a case which seems, the case and some some one said was case what was the same as the case in Texas a few yrs ago. I sorry to could not copy view of the camera and dould some one that, these as I really seen them as I could never forget them.

OCR Output:

About 10:00 I was called a tea with light a kningly changed into a blinking red light. The object moved along and in a few minutes stopped at about 15 minutes distance. Then it started again in the distance, I called my aunt a cousin to the window and both of them saw it to. I kept watching it for a while as it made a few turns and then suddenly changed its direction and disappearance rather rapidly. It was a clear and a checked not like star or anything we have seen before. As for comparing it, I wouldn't have regulating what it was, may be a flying saucer or something. I am quite sure it was no satellite, meteor or an airplane. These sighting are a very occasional ours and there was no noise and no trail and no indication where it went to. I am hoping you will investigate this matter and let me know what it could be. Sincerely,
Blodgett

Transcription of the text in the document:

"And meteorelogical flying object, that gradually seems to go 'built', they migraten ago, March 26, at about 7:15 P.M., that stay for about 2 minutes, and seemed to go about 45 degrees to the southeast out of our sight and looked south on our ground track of our gravel road and looked eastward and couldn't distinguish any details or, nor size, but altitude would make it thin Moon shaped, and about that would make the moon gaseous in texture, but, it seemed, could not make out any real shape to determine just what it was, as rather than to expose it to the sight of others, who would miscionstrue, that it was a phenomena, it was moving rather speedily and notstill. But, if it is sighted again, it would be immediately followed by a search to deteremine what it is or was. As it seems, that in was not a visible, at would any people, a physical thing, it some how."
