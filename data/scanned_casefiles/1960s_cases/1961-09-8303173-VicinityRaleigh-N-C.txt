THIS MATTER IS A VERY SHORT TERM OBJECT WHICH APPEARED FROM NOWHERE AND DESCENDED RAPIDLY I.E. IN LESS THAN ONE SECOND. ITS VERTICAL SPEED WAS TREMENDOUS THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL AIRCRAFT WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN THIS AREA. THIS OBJECT WAS SILENTLY AND MADE NO SOUND TO MY RECOLLECTION. IT HAD NO RUNNING LIGHTS AS NORMAL AIRCRAFT WOULD HAVE. THE OBJECT APPEARED IN THE SKY AND DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO NEAR THE TOP OF THE TREES IN THE DISTANCE WHICH WERE PERHAPS A QUARTER TO A HALF MILE AWAY FROM MY LOCATION. AFTER REACHING THIS NEAR TREETOP LEVEL IT THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT RAPIDLY ALMOST AS IF IT HAD REACHED SOME FORM OF PROPULSION SYSTEM OR GAINED TREMENDOUS SPEED. I AM FAMILIAR WITH NORMAL AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA AND THIS SIGHTING WAS QUITE DIFFERENT. I WISH THERE WERE MORE DETAILS I COULD PROVIDE BUT THIS ENCOUNTER WAS EXTREMELY BRIEF AND LEFT ME QUITE STARTLED AND SHAKEN.
