Washington D.C.

Dear Sir:

On Sunday Sept. 17th. 1961 at 05:00 a.m. While Driving North on Route U.S. # 1 Apprx. 25 miles South of Raleigh North Carolina, With a Friend We Observed a Burning Star, Having Been in the United States Navy and Knowing the Importance of Such a Sight, We Stopped and Observed Same for About 10 Minutes. After We Got Home I Decided to Write to You About it and Describe Same to the Best of my Ability. Before Burning out the Smoke Made 2 Different Signs About 30 Feet Long or More.
