11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Numerous sightings reported throughout Alaska of object(s) appearing as bright astro bodies and in most cases alternately changing colors. Some reports indicated directional changes. Sightings were reported from Anchorage, Fairbanks, Cape Lisbourne, Northeast Cape, Cape Newenham, Cape Romanzoff, Inalikleet, Indian Mountain and Port Tulson, Cordova. Public reaction resulted from Radio and Press coverage. Initial investigations revealed that most repairs were attributed to Astro Bodies and Satellites.
Only one report had Radar verification.

Are they taking any action? No NORAD is getting several reports from reliable sources of their own interest. Namely people in the various defense sector regions. That have been reporting something.

Now are you still there? Right. Listen there's one entry here I believe you've got let me see. Yeh. 935 CO or the CO Army Depot at Seymour, Alaska reported 5 UFOs heading east. That was at 0935 I believe I did pass on up. Right. What is the weather conditions? Okay. - Colonel, in this time and the visibility? Hold on one sir. Okay. SE 1 is reporting clear and 15. Clear and 15 and the conditions of darkness. What is it there now is it clear daylight? Stand by 1 sir. Colonel, Okay go ahead. They just about passed the twilight and the sun is beginning to come up. Right, so some of these observations have been made under twilight conditions. Well sir, I would say the last one was 1040 and that would be about 30 minutes ago and the sun is just about breaking so I would say oh the last one at 1017. I would estimate it began around the end of twilight. Keep us posted this is starting to look interesting.

Yes sir. Well pass on as quick as we get it after we pass on to NORAD. Okay thanks. Bye.

No radar pickup. Are you getting any sightings other than those that are reported from the SAC people? We had reports from our people out at the 25th region and the 29th region. Right. Are these numerous and about the same pattern? Well, okay, just about. We've been long as we're following directions here we thought we were getting numerous sightings when our SAC was Well we've had this reported to us by them. We had similar reports from the objects in the air from our sources as well as from SAC. Does this reach a point where your instructions require for you to make an aerial observation? We have no such instructions. No. Okay thank you.

NON-SCHEDULED NEWSLETTER #22
March 10th, 1965

WE REGRET TO ANNOUNCE the recent death of Manon Darleine of Hollywood, California. Born in France, Madan Darleine was a long-time researcher into flying saucers, psychic phenomena, and other related mysteries. Her voluminous files go back for many years, and she was keenly interested in the mysterious goings-on in the Los Angeles area in the early 1950's, notably the disappearance of saucer researchers Hunrath and Wilkinson. Her interest continued, though her health failed in recent years, and she was seen regularly at the annual Giant Rock conventions. Your Editor met her several times, corresponded regularly, and considered her a close personal friend.

NEW "CONTACT" STORY: On February 11th, a Watsonville, California television repairman named Sid Padrick told newspaper reporters that he took a ride in a flying saucer at 2 a.m. one night the previous month. Padrick claimed that he was invited aboard with an assurance that the nine-man crew was "absolutely not hostile," and that he found the craft perched on a hillside near his home. The contactee was vague about some aspects of his trip, but did say that the crew looked like normal human beings of average height, and that the ship's motive power came from "energy transferred through a light source known to them." I.e., known to the space people. The commander of the craft also told him that they have been here before and that they are visiting us on an exploratory trip of some sort, though Padrick feels that they have other peaceful motives.

In detail: His report of the adventure was made to Major O. B. Reeder at Hamilton Air Force Base, and the data was forwarded to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, as is the routine procedure in UFO cases. More details on this incident will appear in our forthcoming June issue of SAUCER NEWS.

SAUCER FLAP IN VIRGINIA CONTINUES: Clippings are still pouring into our office regarding the saucer flap which began in Virginia last December, and which extended at least through the end of January.

On the night of January 25th, several people watched a twinkling object, shaped like a pie plate and looking like a spinning top, which bobbed up and down at a very low altitude over the Rappahannock River, at Fredericksburg, Va. The object was observed for a period of ten minutes.

Another sighting was made the same night at the foot of a mountain near Marion, Va. This UFO had sparks flying from it, and was heard to cracking sound. A few seconds later, something rose up from the explosion and headed toward Marion. A small fire resulting from the explosion was put out by forestry officials, but apparently no physical evidence was found.

(Page Two)

At Wallops Station, Va., one of America's NASA rocket launching facilities, a NASA engineer and others observed a UFO on January 5th, at 6 p.m. The engineer, named Dempsey Burton, described it as a bright object shooting up from the southwestern horizon. It appeared about one fourth the size of the moon; was yellow-orange in color; and traveled from the horizon directly overhead in just a few seconds. Burton added that he mysteriously object looked "like an ovalized comet without a tail." The Air Force is investigating the incident as well as another previously unpublished UFO sighting which took place at Wallops Station back in October 1964.

Finally, we have a report from Staunton - scene of several previous UFO incidents - which tells of a group of seven teenagers who saw and later photographed little men from outer space. This story has all the earmarks of a hoax to us, but we give it to you for what it is worth. Steven Houff, 16, was driving on U.S. Route 250 with several friends when he saw a suspicious-looking man near the side of the road. He stopped the car and chased the individual until the man was joined by two others, all about 3½ feet in stature. They were allegedly wearing one-piece, skin-tight garments that were silver in color. Later Houff went to a nearby barn with a photographer, where a color picture of one little man was taken. Just how they knew the creature was in the barn is not clear, nor had the picture been developed at last report.

SAUCER FLAP IN ALASKA: On the night of January 27th, dozens of residents of Anchorage, Alaska, contacted local police and newspapers in concern over a multicolored flickering UFO which hovered near the city. Dr. William C. Lengeworthy, assistant professor of Chemistry at Alaska Methodist University, trained a 100-power telescope on the object and concluded that it was "odder than anything I've seen before." The professor stated that although smaller than Jupiter in apparent size, the unknown object cast off more light than does that planet. Whatever the object was, it apparently stayed beyond the range of our radar, according to an Air Force spokesman, who said the incident was under investigation.

Many other sightings were made the previous night, including one by Mrs. Ed Ray of Anchorage. She was sitting in her living room with the family when she saw an extremely bright light with the intensity of an arc light shining through one of the house's large windows. The frightening event was accompanied by a buzzing sound, which turned into an explosion a few seconds later. The whole family observed that the light was coming down through the trees from above, and for a few moments, just before the explosion, it shined into the living room with blinding intensity.

Alaska Lights Stump AF

On the 27th of January, multi-colored, flickering lights mystified authorities at Anchorage, Alaska.

One bright light hung due south of the city, 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon giving off a kaleidoscope glow throughout the night. The Air Force said it had no explanation for the light.

Three Professors at the Alaskan Methodist University studied the light through a 100-power telescope and described it as smaller than Jupiter but more brilliant. Dr. William C. Langworthy, Assistant Professor of Chemistry at AMU said, "It's odder than anything I've seen before ... It's moving at the same rate of speed as a star and it's not one of the planets."

Several other "multi-colored, flickering lights" were also seen. Langworthy was joined by Dr. Chang Kim and Ross Schoff of the University. Conjectures ranged from a supernova or a large balloon-type satellite or a star—possibly Betelguese. The Air Force claimed their radars did not register the object.

Dear [redacted]

Your letter to the Secretary of the Air Force has been referred to this office.

The recent UFO sightings in Alaska are attributed to a misinterpretation of natural or conventional objects such as aircraft and/or aircraft lights, meteors, and satellites.

The current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects, is attached for your information. This report gives information on the program since its origin in 1968.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
Lt. Colonel, USAF
