Text from the document:

Dear Sir:
I am a resident of Anchorage, Alaska. We have reports of strange objects flying around our area. Any information on the sightings, would you please let me know.
Also, if you have any literature at all of U.F.O.s, would you please send some to me.

Are they taking any actions? - No NORAD is getting several reports of sightings, but there is nothing to it as far as we can determine.

Now are you still there? Right. Listen there is one entry to the GI Army Dep-t. I believe I did pass on this. That is the weather Colonel. I believe it did go on up right away. Listen this is Mr. Bolling at 2152. NORAD has received two reports today but neither had anything associated with it by darkness. You know what time is it there now? Is it still daylight? Stand by. Okay, what is it they are saying? Well, it sounds like Burl Rogers and the people have been made aware of the incident under twilight conditions. Well sir, I'd say they would know more about it than we do here, we're just getting the information from them, after midnight last night and I've been listening to everyone of them. Well let's see what other incidents we have here. It would be less than one minute ago that this was seen at 1017. I would estimate it began around the end of the twilight to dusk or darkness. Keep his profound this sighting for intelligence purposes shall we? Okay, thanks. Bye.

NO - OKAY thanks. They are not getting any sightings other than those that are reported from the SAC people. The had reports that were published in the news media and sent in from SAC. Are there any UFO sightings here we thought were identical? Well okay, as long as we're following our normal reporting channels, we'll keep you informed on these which we receive. When our data is as up as their data, we had similar reports from the objects in the sky as they did from SAC. Does this reach a point where your own observations stand? We have no such instructions. No. Okay and thank you/observations. We have no such instructions.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

NON-SCHEDULED NEWSLETTER #22
March 10th, 1965

WE REGRET TO ANNOUNCE the recent death of Manan Darlaine of Hermosa Beach, California. 
Born in France, Madam Darlaine was a long-time researcher into psychic and saucer phenomena, and closely associated with many of the leaders in the flying saucer field in the early 1950's, notably the disappearance of "saucer" researchers from the Bethune-Long Island area in 1953. She was in constant correspondence with leaders in this field during those times, corresponded regularly, and considered by those close personal friends.

RED PHOTOGRAPH study: On February 11th, a farmer named Sid Padrick told newspaper reporters that he had seen a red-colored saucer-shaped object on his farm near Hollister, California. He said this object "came within about 150 feet of me and hovered for a few minutes". Padrick then ran into his house to get his camera but, by the time he returned, the object was gone. He did say that the object looked like normal human beings of about six feet in height were standing or working around the outside of it. Padrick had seen such objects before on his land, and felt that they had been there before, as there was a sort of pathway worn on the ground where they landed. More details on this incident will be in our forthcoming June issue of SAUCER NEWS.

SAUCER SIGHTINGS CONTINUE: Sightings of unidentified flying objects are still pouring in to our office, regarding the "Saucer Flap" which began in late December, and which seems to be continuing without letup. We have hundreds of reports of luminous objects, disc-shaped craft, etc. as being seen in the sky over many areas. We like to plot these sightings and looking like a "planning board", as it enables us to get a better picture of what seems to be going on. Another sighting was made the same night at the foot of a mountain, and this UFO had sparks flying from it, and was heard to explode. A small fire resulting from the explosion was put out by forestry personnel.

At Wallops Station, Va., one of America's NASA rocket launch centers, on January 9th, at 9:30 p.m., NASA engineers and others observed a UFO, according to a story sent to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and forwarded by them.
The object was disc-shaped and was observed flying and traveling from the horizon to directly overhead in just a few seconds. After traveling over the station, the object doubled back and took up a position directly over the station, then shot up at a tremendous speed and disappeared.
This took place at Wallops Station back in October of 1964. The scene of several previously reported sightings at the station by personnel from outer space. The story has all the earmarks of a case which has been thoroughly investigated prior to the writing. According to the report, two men from outer space made contact with one of the workers there and warned him that "in the near future more air force and civilian personnel will be involved in close encounters again".
In the statement, they said, "much more is going on around you than you know," and chased the individual until the man was joined by two others, all of whom were told that sighting by more than one little man was taken.
Just how they knew the creature was in the area and then the future developments a letter subscriber devotes a last paragraph.
SAUCER FLAP IN ALASKA: On the night of January 27th, dozens of Alaskan people, including housewives, policemen, and even three chemistry students at Alaska Methodist University, trained a 100-power telescope on a strange aerial object which hovered over Anchorage.
The object, which was observed for nearly two hours, defied explanation. It was brighter than the planet Venus and many times larger. It remained stationary and changed color from white to orange-red and back again. Many other sightings were made the previous night, including Ray of Anchorage, who reported "a huge fiery ball" in the sky. The frightening event was accompanied by a buzzing sound. Telephone operators in Anchorage later reported receiving a flood of calls about the objects. The whole event seemed to peak at 7:30 p.m. One observer said the object was so bright it shone into the living room with blinding intensity.

The image contains no photograph, only text describing an incident of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) observed in Alaska. The text states that on the 27th of January, multi-colored flickering lights were observed in the sky, south of the city of Fairbanks. The object was observed through a telescope and described as having no explanation, according to a Professor at the University of Alaska who investigated the phenomenon.

Alaska Lights Stump AF
On the 27th of January, multi-colored, flickering lights were reported authorities at a  City, 35 12 s. degrees snores the horizon. 
One bright light hung due south of the city, 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. Through a telescope, the object appeared to some like the landing light of a large jet, but it had no explanation for the light. Professor St. L. Conrad of the University of Alaska, examined the object through a 100-power telescope and described it as "like a ship's running lights moving at constant speed and with no visible means of propulsion."
Several other "multi-colored, flickering lights" appeared in the sky. Dr. Chang Kim and Ross Shield of the University's Geophysical Institute said a large circular, satellite or a star—possibly Venus—could have been the source, but the Air Force claimed they had no flights in the area.

Dear Mr. Your letter to the Secretary of the Air Force has been referred to this office.

The recent UFO sightings in Alaska are attributed to a misinterpretation of natural phenomena, conventional objects such as aircraft and/or satellite lights, meteorites, and satellites.

The current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project investigating unidentified flying objects, is the latest chapter since its origin in 1948. Sincerely,
