The object was all silver with a black stripe down the middle. I am not very good at guessing height so I could not tell you how high it was. If you have any information on the identity of this please give it to me. Please answer my letter.

Dear Sirs,

I hope I am not just taking up your time, but this seems important to me. My name is (illegible, appears to be a Catholic School), I am 14 years of age, attend Saint Stephen's School (a Catholic School) in Oil City, and belong to Saint Stephen's parish.

Recently, many jets have been going over Oil City and Franklin, two cities of Western Pennsylvania. I have a telescope and watch these jets go over with it. In this because I like to identify them because I hope to fly one of the bombers as an officer in the U.S.A.F. someday myself. One day, May 15, a strange object appeared in the sky between Oil City, Franklin, traveling WEST to EAST the object would speed up and slow down having irregular speed.

I ran into the house and got my telescope. Because I thought I would miss it I ran, but a chance to get the "scope". On 60 POWER, it was going slow at the time and was easy to focus on. Even though only on 60 POWER I got a very clear picture of it. It disappeared, after about 45 seconds, behind a jet stream and I did not see it again.

My Mother told me to call Civilian Defense. They told me to call the State Police which told me there is no place around here dealing with U.F.O. I called the A.F. Reserve in town and was told to write to you.

The object looked like a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter on its side. I have a scratch on planes and jets and no other aircraft or owns like it. THIS IS HOW I SAW IT:
