The image does not contain any photographs, but rather shows a star chart illustrating the positions of various stars, planets, and constellations in the night sky. The text describes the appearance of bright winter stars, including Jupiter and Saturn, which brighten the November evening skies, as well as the appearance of Mars and Venus before dawn.

Text from the document:

ASTRONOMY

Bright Winter Stars Appear

Two planets, Jupiter and Saturn, brighten the November evening skies. . .* Venus just before dawn.

by JAMES STOKLEY

If you look toward the eastern sky on a clear November evening, you will see a region studded with brilliant stars. It shows the "winter face of the sky" - the constellations that dominate the winter heavens. 

highest in the sky is the star Capella, and nearby in the northwest is the famous Pleiades star cluster. Dominating the southern heavens are the two brightest stars of all, Sirius and Canopus. 

The planets Jupiter and Saturn add brightness to this magnificent scene. Jupiter, easily the most striking, shines with a steadier light than the stars, and is less than half the moon's diameter above the horizon. Below it, Saturn appears as a less brilliant, reddish object.

Mars soon after midnight and Venus just before dawn.

While watching the sky in the evening, one also notices that Mars has risen in the east. It can be seen a few minutes before 1 a.m. is seen among the stars of the constellation Virgo. As the morning approaches, the brilliant planet Venus appears above the east-southeastern horizon just 3 or 4 degrees above the point where the sun will rise.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for October 24, 1964
FIELDS CHANGE ON METEORITES
Need Not Deform Life
METEORITES need not deform in hitting Earth, contrary to previous belief. Fact is, they can pass through the atmosphere without any distortion at all, says S. S. Johnson of U.S. Geological Survey. The low-density, low-strength material and long-chain fatty acids present in some meteoroids, he finds, protect them from destruction. He studied specimens of stony meteorites, chondrites, that showed no signs of deformation. Straight-chain hydrocarbons on certain meteorites also remain unchanged, he found.

However, C. B. Moore and A. J. WILL of New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, on the other hand, say they have found evidence for deformation and melting of some meteorites just the same. So the question is still not fully resolved, they believe, there is a range of the possibilities.

Their work involves studying the effects of impact on artificial meteorites. This indicates that some meteorites deform strongly under the impact force as they hit the atmosphere, becoming the shape of a flat disk or a flat bowl, while other meteorites retain their undeformed shapes as the solids at the time of hitting. This way, some of the information- carrying structures in the meteorites may be preserved intact, they say in Nature, 204(4961), 1964.

Messgeraph Sub Seeks Gulf Stream Mysteries 
THE ROLLS ROYCE of the sea, the 246-foot oceanographic research vessel, MESSGERAPH has been launched on a hunt for mysteries of the Gulf Stream.
Equipped with the latest electronic gear, designed to probe the ocean depths and record sea-floor sediments, the MESSGERAPH, 'under the direction of the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office, carries 36 scientists aboard in the hunt for clues to the Gulf Stream's fluctuations, waves and eddies.
Using unproved methods for keeping the ship exactly at any point over the submarine terrain for minute recording periods, the MESSGERAPH is specially designed to study sub-sea mountai
ns, deep-diving bathyscaphs and associated currents in the Gulf Stream.
'Working around the clock, like a Grayward ocean monsters, the ship's crew will converge on targets spotted by the ship's electronic eyes, radar and sonar.
They will photograph, measure and analyze the Gulf's depths and currents as the ship maneuvers through the murky green waters, seeking to solve SOME of the stream's mysteries.
LT. W. WASHINGTON, D.C. - Just how fast can the Gulf Stream run? What causes its waves and eddies? What's the condition of the sea floor in the Stream's path?
These are some of the questions the MESSGERAPH, a Navy oceanographic research ship named after the 19th century "Auguste Piccard" in memory of the late famous Swiss oceanographer, hopes to answer.
Last summer the stream, named after its discoverer Benjamin Franklin in the 1700's, was clocked at more than 8 knots - faster than any other oceanic current.
This huge river of the sea, flowing along the eastern coast of the U.S. and carrying warm water from the Tropics up to New England, is of vital importance to the nation's weather, shipping and coastal life.
A group of about 36 oceanographers and technicians aboard the MESSGERAPH are using the latest electronic gear - sonar, radar, precision depth-recording instruments and a huge array of other scientific equipment - to study the mysteries of the Gulf Stream.
Working around the clock, they are converging on targets spotted by the ship's electronic eyes to photograph, measure and analyze the Gulf's depths and currents as the MESSGERAPH maneuvers through the murky green waters.
The main objectives are to:
1. Determine the actual speed and diameter of the Gulf Stream at various points along its course.
2. Learn more about the waves and eddies that constantly form in the Stream.
3. Probe the condition of the sea floor below the Stream.
4. Discover whether there are any "mountains" under the water that could influence the Stream's direction and flow.
5. Find out how the Stream changes from season to season and year to year.
The MESSGERAPH, with its able crew, is expected to provide some of the answers through its intensive scientific studies of the Gulf Stream, over the next few months.

SPACE
Satellite Tracker
Keeps Sky Vigil
A HISTORY-MAKING white dome located just off the New Jersey Turnpike contains an array of radar, radio and optical telescopes that are as essential to space exploration as the Cape Kennedy rocket range is to launching vehicles.

Originally, it was part of BMEWS, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, which was built to monitor possible missile attacks across the North Polar regions. Now, however, the dome is part of SPADATS, the Space Detection and Tracking System.
SPADATS is an Air Defense Command headquarters, located at Colorado Springs, Colo., which provides continuous information on the movement of all man-made objects in space. This information, about 3,000 objects registered, is supplied to many government agencies and contractors involved in the space program.
The white dome at New Jersey, known as the Satellite Tracking Center, operates as part of the worldwide SPADATS network. From this vantage point, it maintains a constant vigil over the skies to trace the paths of satellites, rocket boosters and space debris.
The tracking data gathered at the New Jersey station, and at other SPADATS installations throughout the world, is relayed by high-speed communications links to the central SPADATS control center at Colorado Springs.
This information, in turn, is distributed to agencies needing to know the location of space objects for purposes of space vehicle guidance, re-entry and collision avoidance. It is also used to help predict when and where space debris and inoperative satellites will re-enter the earth's atmosphere.
World Adopts New Standard of Time
AN ATOMIC DEFINITION of the second, replacing the astronomical definition, was authorized in 1967 by the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures. The new definition, based on the natural vibrations of the cesium atom, provides a much more accurate and stable standard for the measurement of time. The transition to the atomic time standard is expected to be a more precise definition in the future.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph or image present in this particular page. The text on the page appears to be a "Nature Note" about the "Rosary Pea", providing a description and warning about the dangers of this plant.

As requested, here is the full text from the document:

NATURE NOTE
Rosary Pea
BEWARE of a bright red pea-bearing pod,
Two black seed in it. It looks beautiful, but it is
deadly poison.
The Rosary pea, sometimes called the Crab's
eye, is a bright scarlet pea-shaped pod containing two hard, black, shiny seeds. While the
plant is beautiful, it is one of the most deadly
plants known. Once the seeds are chewed and
swallowed, the plant's poison sets in, causing
violent vomiting, intestinal pain, trembling and
sometimes death.
A single pea can prove fatal to a human being.
Children are often attracted to the pretty scarlet
pods and the shiny black seeds, not realizing
the deadly danger within. Take care to keep the
children away from these plants.

QUALITY One print and two transparencies provided by TDEW
1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-1 from Major H. Quintanilla Jr. (TDEW) to analyze the image of an unidentified flying object which were submitted for study.
2. ANALYSIS: Mr. Charles Chapin and Mr. Larry W. Gunther, both from TDEPD, assisted in this analysis. The two transparencies and the one print which was produced from a negative, were studied.
3. COMMENTS: The two negatives (transparencies) and the one print which was produced from a negative, were studied. It is not possible to determine if the camera was stationary or moving. The station D emergency has many tiny spots which appear to be caused with tracks of possible stars showing up as a sharp number of images. These tracks could be caused by the object or a reflection or a refraction within the transparencies.
4. The number 7 transparency has similar lines as the number 6 transparency. These lines appear to be caused by the camera motion and are optical conditions.
5. The lines on the paper print seem to go in two directions, approximately 45 degrees apart from the paper edge. The back side of the paper print has a few brush hairs or a star or satellite trace. The back side of the print has an insignificant amount of these world is insignia. Because can be one or two things.
6. The film could have been exposed through porous material or black paper, thus causing the molted effect. This effect could also be caused by bad film or bad processing.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The following is a signed account of a UFO sighting by my brother and myself:

THE SIGHTING:

Myself, the undersigned, Mr. A. and Mr. B. had just driven into the East Gardner parking lot, Danvers, Massachusetts upon returning from lunch.

Mr. A. called our attention to a strange-appearing object in the sky, about one-half mile distant, traveling at a very high rate of speed through the sky in-front and below us. This object was circular in shape, very bright, and the reflection from the sun was so strong that it was difficult to gaze at it directly.

We estimated the object to be a sea gull at first, but the speed and maneuverability of the object quickly eliminated this possibility. The object was traveling in a very erratic flight, at times appearing to reverse its direction, and at others side-slipping through the sky at a terrific speed.

My brother and I watched the object for approximately 20-30 seconds, and since both Mr. A. and I knew of each other's interest in UFOs, we both realized immediately that this was no normal aircraft or natural phenomenon.

It is interesting that within a few seconds I realized that it was not a sea gull and had little chance to see it. We then tried to get a better look, but the object had by this time climbed to a very high altitude and disappeared from view.

By this time the object disappeared only seemed to be about the size of a small star. Mr. A. never got a close look at it.

It is interesting that within a few seconds I realized that it was not a sea gull and had little chance to see it. We then tried to get a better look, but the object had by this time climbed to a very high altitude and disappeared from view.

By this time the object disappeared only seemed to be about the size of a small star. Mr. A. never got a close look at it.

According to the U.S. Weather Bureau at Boston, the altitude of the sighting was 2500 feet. If I assume the following:
1. The UFO was at an altitude higher than 2500 feet.
2. The UFO was at an angle of 30° above the horizon.
3. The UFO had an apparent diameter of 1/10 of a degree.

Then the UFO was 500' lower than 2500' and had a real diameter of 1.30'.

SIGHTING: (name redacted) and some friends had just returned from lunch and were sitting in the car on the Sylvester Parking Lot. As they were leaving, he thought he saw a large, dark object in the sky. At first he thought it was a plane, but as he got closer it was clearly something else. The object was hovering at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet. It was silver-gray in color, disc-shaped, and about 35-40 feet in diameter. The object was motionless for about 3-4 minutes, then it shot straight up and disappeared from view. 
EVALUATION: This is one witness that I know very well as he is my brother-in-law. The object observed appears to be a good case of a disc-shaped UFO that was observed at close range. The description is similar to the typical disc-shaped objects reported. The size and distance estimated appear to be reasonable. The rapid vertical departure is also typical.

1. FOR DISTANCE OF OBJECT FROM OBSERVER
D = 200'

2. FOR REAL DIAMETER OF OBJECT
3/16" = .015'
DIAMETER = .005 x 40' = 2' = 24 inch diameter

WITNESSES: Redacted, Massachusetts 
DATE: 6 October 1964
PLACE: Haverhill, Massachusetts

The text in the document is as follows:

Haverhill was driving his car with several passengers when something bright and flashingglided across the road in front of the car. The object was brightly luminous, about 10-12feet in diameter, and seemed to be under intelligent control. It made several sharp, right-angled turns at a speed estimated to be about 1000 mph. The object shot off towardSalem, New Hampshire at a tremendous speed.

EVALUATION: I have found nothing to discredit this sighting. The witnesses were convincing and seemed reliable. Their description of the object's maneuvers and speed are consistent with other reports I have seen, and cannot be easily explained. There may be important details other thanthat presented.

POLICE CHECK "FLYING SAUCER"
Two Haverhill Police Officers spent several minutes investigating a report by two youths that they had seen a bright, round shaped object that had "a glow to it" was hovering above the trees off Broadway near Forest Street.
Sgt. Robert C. Dunsmore and Officer John McLin were the officers called to the scene at 8:15 p.m. after the youths, William Chasse, 16, of 18 Marble St., his brother, Robert, 15, and Robert Sancy, 18, of 53 Webster Rd., Methuen, made the report.
No details as to nature or other evidence of the sighting were available.
This morning Police Chief William A. Ross, after reading the officer's reports, said, "This seems to be the end of it. They searched and found nothing." Officers at the police station concur in the belief that they had seen something "up there."

Dear Major Jacks:

On 12 October 1964 I received your letter of 7 October 1964 which acknowledged receipt of the request I made to your office regarding a Somerville sighting report mistakenly attributed to Fosterdale, New York. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. As I indicated in my previous letter, you are referring to:

My request for a meeting is to repeat a request made by me in my letter to you of 13 October 1964. Please disregard this request as it has now been taken care of directly with other Air Force agencies.

I would appreciate it so much if you would answer these other questions as well, but I am especially interested in receiving the copy of the letter you sent to me via APSD (RPI) in September 1964. Thanks again for your help. I hope to hear from your office soon.

Sincerely,

Tucson, Arizona

Object Near Bowie, Arizona

Three adults, Mr. and Mrs. William Moss and their daughter, were driving near Bowie, Arizona, at 8:15 p.m., October 9, 1964 when they observed a strange object in the sky. 
Mrs. Moss was the first to spot the object. As soon as she did, she pointed it out to her husband. It appeared to be about the size of a baseball, glowing, and moving upwards. It appeared to ascend a short distance, then stopped. They watched the object for about 5 minutes and then it suddenly shot across the sky towards the mountains.
The light was not emitted from the object itself but seemed to be cast upward from the object into the sky. It was not observed to have any doors, windows or other appendages. As it ascended, it seemed to be a solid, single unit. Mrs. Moss reported that the object made no sound. The light was not blinking, but was a steady glow. She estimated that it must have been about 1,000 feet in altitude. For no apparent reason, the object then suddenly shot across the sky to the west and disappeared behind the mountains. 
At that point, Mrs. Moss turned to her daughter and asked if she had seen the object. Her daughter replied that she had and that it was "brilliant".

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET

CASE REPORT: ________, 1964

WITNESS #1: 
Age: 59
Occupation: Farmer (6) 

PLACE: Westboorn, Massachusetts
DATE: 11 October 1964
TIME: 4:00 PM EDT

BACKGROUND: On the morning of October 11, 1964, a farmer and his son observed a UFO over a field on their farm for a period of approximately 2 1/2 hours. The object was described as a dark grey or black elliptical-shaped object, about 150-200 feet in diameter, hovering about 100-150 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be about 100 feet wide and 50 feet thick. It was silent, except for a slight hissing or rushing sound. The object remained stationary for the entire observation period, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

SITUATION: The witness and his son were startled by the appearance of the object and observed it closely. They were apparently quite shaken by the experience, as the report indicates that they were "still partially stunned" when they were interviewed. Condition of the witness was normal, with no physiological effects noted. The object was observed under good visibility conditions, with no cloud cover.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

The witnesses. Neither had seen or heard of UFOs or weird flying objects before. They described what they witnessed as a "real UFO". It made several passes over the area, during which its lights were observed to change color and brightness. No noise was heard. It disappeared abruptly after several minutes.

The witnesses appeared to be sincere and reliable. Their reaction indicates that the sighting made a strong impression on them. Noting that they had seen a "real UFO" suggests they may have been convinced of the unusual nature of the object. The report notes that their observation and description of the object's behavior and characteristics are consistent with reports of other UFO sightings, and that this sighting may be significant.

AIRCRAFT T r'-J-J'I
ACCELERATED OUT-OF-SIGHT THE BRIGHT LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE OBJECT SHOWN IN THE ABOVE DRAWING, LOOKED LIKE VERY BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT ANDSLIGHTLY SILVER COMPARED TO THE LIGHT OF THE MOON. THE OBJECT WAS WELL-DEFINED, BLACK IN COLOR AND APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER, WITH NO VISIBLE MARKINGS AND ABOUT 75 FEET OFF THE GROUND. THE OBJECT TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT TERRIFIC SPEED AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT WITHIN 3 SECONDS. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN IN THE NORTH, 75 FROM THE HORIZON AND WAS LAST SEEN TOWARD THE NORTH AND 10 FROM THE HORIZON. WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME WERE CLEAR WITH LIGHT WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT ONE MILE AWAY.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE OBSERVER WAS A TRUSTED AND RELIABLE INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT INDULGE IN IMAGINATIVE OR FANCIFUL STORIES, AND WHOSE JUDGEMENT IS ACCEPTED AS BEING SOUND. THE SPEED WAS EXTREMELY FAST, ALTHOUGH WHILE OVER BROOKTON IT SEEMED SLOW IN COMPARISON TO ITS PREVIOUS AND LATER SPEED.
EVALUATION: THE USAF WAS CONTACTED AND FOUND THAT NO AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN IN THE AREA AND NO MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS WERE SCHEDULED OR KNOWN TO BE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. IT WAS APPARENTLY SOME FORM OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, AS REPORTED.

EVALUATION: THE UFO OBSERVER, MAJOR BROOKS, REPORTED THAT HE HAD SIGHTED AND WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT, GLOWING LIGHT IN THE NORTH ABOUT 75 FROM THE HORIZON. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE BLACK IN COLOR AND APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW WITHIN 3 SECONDS. MAJOR BROOKS REPORTED THAT HE HAD CONTACTED THE USAF AND THAT THEY HAD NO AIRCRAFT OR FLIGHTS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. MAJOR BROOKS WAS DESCRIBED AS A RELIABLE AND CREDIBLE OBSERVER AND HIS REPORT WAS CONSIDERED VALID.
