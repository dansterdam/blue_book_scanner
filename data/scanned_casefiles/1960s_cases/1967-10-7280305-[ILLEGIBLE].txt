MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Subject: UFO Report, 19 October 1967

On 20 October 1967 received a call from [redacted] Parkersburg, W. Va.

On 19 October at 9:05 pm EDT at Williamstown, W. Va. he sighted a UFO. The total duration of the sighting was about 40 seconds.(20 seconds in car and 20 seconds outside of car). There was one other witness to sighting. Mr.[redacted] did not know his name but got his license plate number.

The object had wings like a horseshoe and had lights all along the wing. The lights on the wing were red and green and there were (poss.) White lights on body of the craft. None of the lights flashed but were on constantly. These wings met in front and joined, the height of the object at 2/4 mile.

He saw object while driving, it seemed to be hovering. He then stopped, it was directly overhead. He heard a deep jet sound and the craft started to move slowly. It did a semicircle and disappeared behind a hill. The observer was looking toward Williamstown when it disappeared and estimated his distance as 4 miles from a local airport.

There was a full moon that you could just barely see and it was a clear night.

2. LOCATION: Little Rock, Arkansas

10. CONCLUSION: (BURNING BARN)

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground, Visual

7. COURSE: North

8. PHOTOS: [X] Yes  [ ] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [X] Yes  [ ] No

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers described the object as "light-self-luminous" solid. Fuzzy, appeared as a point of light, it appeared to be white light changing colors to red and green. Most white and red. The object was first seen approx. 1N, NW at elevation of 20 to 30 deg and disappeared suddenly at an elevation of 15 to 20 deg in roughly the NW.

COMMENTS: Arcturus was at an elevation of 25 deg and azimuth of 275 deg at the beginning of the sighting, and elevation of 25 deg and azimuth of 250 deg at the end. A B-52 observed a burning barn about 83 miles distant. Because of the version and sudden disappearance of the object, it seems likely that the observers were seeing the burning barn.

THE POSITION OF ANY AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA AND IN THE REFERENCE
TO THE POSITION OF A SIGHTING SUCH AS THIS COULD BE DETERMINED
VISUALLY OR BY SIMPLY REFERENCE TO THE RAPCON SEARCH RADAR SCOPES WHICH CAN PAINT
THE B-52 AT 20 NM AT 12000 FEET. ACCORDINGLY, IT
IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING WAS OTHER
THAN ONE OF THE AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA. IN THE ABSENCE OF
OTHER SUBSTANTIATING INFORMATION AND IN VIEW OF THE EXPERIENCE AND
RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVERS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT A PHENOMENON
OF SOME SORT WAS OBSERVED BUT THE LOGICAL CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
