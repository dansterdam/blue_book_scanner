ORIGINATING AGENCY    HQ Chicago ADS     REPORT NO.    CHADS-TL-02-61     PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

The following letter, dated 3 June 1961, was sent by [redacted] to the 64th Troop Carrier Sq (AF Reserve) at O'Hare Airport, Illinois, and was forwarded to this headquarters.

To Whom It May Concern,

I have this address from [redacted] for reporting UFOs.
Maybe this is nothing but June 1st at 9:05 to 9:10 while watching the cat in the back yard my attention was drawn to a large glow in the sky east over Lake Michigan. It was round and much larger than any star so obvious like a miniature moon- I wasn't aware of any movement on it's part til later- I quickly called 6 others in my family and was very disappointed when they reached me the glow had died down and "it" was heading toward Chicago acting like an airplane with lights going on and off on each side.

We watched it til it disappeared - another aircraft had passed it going nearly north - I didn't hear any motors and this was low from where I saw it. (at this point [redacted] lapsed into philosophy which has no bearing on this report).

A request for more information was sent to [redacted] with the following reply:

Dear Sirs,

June 23 - 1961

I hope I describe the size of the UFO right - compared to our brightest star it was a monster so out of place in the sky on account of its size. I can't find out if Echo was visible that night at 9:30 June 1 because I thought I saw echo too - but now I'm wondering because this other light went in reverse to the course Echo takes. It was much higher, dimmer, and had a faint blue light and also had this burst of light going from east to south west. I know Echo changes altitude, gets dimmer and brighter, but I always saw it coming in the other direction

but then I don't know everything. This went about 15 minutes after the sighting.

Mrs [REDACTED] indicated that she has not come through this activity, but it
