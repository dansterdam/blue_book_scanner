WE REGRET TO ANNOUNCE the recent death of Madam Darlaine of Paris. Born in France, Madam Darlaine was a long-time researcher into flying saucers. She corresponded regularly with SAUCER NEWS during the 1950's, notably the disappearance of "saucer researchers" Hunts and Silvers in the early 1950's....

REGARDING THE SAUCER FLAP IN VIRGINIA CONTINUES: Clippings are still pouring in. On the night of January 25th, several people watched a twinkling object, some thinking it was a satellite, hovering over Vinton, Virginia, for a period of ten minutes.

AT WALLOPS STATION, VA., ONE OF AMERICA'S NASA ROCKET LAUNCHING STATIONS, DEMPSEY BURTON, DESCRIBED IT AS A BRIGHT OBJECT SHOOTING UP FROM THE SOUTH ON JANUARY 5TH, 1965. DEMPSEY BURTON STATES THAT THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT LOOKED LIKE AN OVER-SIZED COMET AS IT STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY, BUT NEITHER HE NOR HIS ASSISTANT WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OBJECT. FINALLY, WE HAVE A REPORT FROM STAUNTON -  SCENE OF SEVERAL INCIDENTS - FROM WHICH TITLE 7, RESEARCH PROBLEMS NO. 6, REPORT FOR FEBRUARY 1965, YOU FIND WHAT IT IS WORTH. STEVEN HOFFER, 16, WAS DRIVING ON U.S. ROUTE 250, BETWEEN STAUNTON AND CHURCHVILLE, WHEN HIS CAR SUDDENLY WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND TURNED OVER. STEVEN EXPLAINS THAT HE SWERVED TO AVOID A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE ROAD, AND THAT HE BELIEVES THE OBJECT AFFECTED HIS CAR'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, CAUSING HIM TO LOSE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, CONTACTED LOCAL POLICE AND NEWSPAPERS CONCERNING FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE SKY OVER ANCHORAGE ON JANUARY 27TH. DR. WILLIAM C. LIVINGSTON, PROJECT SCIENTIST OF THE KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY, INVESTIGATED THIS INCIDENT AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS "NO MORE THAN ANYTHING I'VE SEEN BEFORE." THE LIGHTS WERE APPARENTLY AN AURORA BOREALIS DISPLAY, WHICH IS NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN ALASKA, AND THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE RANGE OF OUR RADAR, ACCORDING TO AN AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN, WHO SAID THAT THIS WAS THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S INCIDENT IN ANCHORAGE.

RAY OF ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, WAS SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM WITH THE FAMILY WHEN THEY ALL SUDDENLY LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED A STRANGE LIGHT OUTSIDE. WITHIN A FEW SECONDS, THE LIGHT TURNED INTO AN EXPLOSION A FEW SECONDS LATER. THE WHOLE FAMILY OBSERVED THE STRANGE INCIDENT, AND THE OBJECT THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION APPEARED TO BE LANDING ON THE GROUND A FEW MOMENTS. JUST PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, RAY STATES THAT THE LIVING ROOM WAS FILLED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT.

RECENT NEWS
NEW REPORTS FROM CALIFORNIA: As reported in our un-scheduled Journal Newsletter #29, February 21st reports, the Air Force has claimed that the alleged UFO sighting in the La Selva Beach area on February 14th was explained as the Coast Guard having spotted flashing lights on a helicopter. However, the civilian witnesses to the incident have refuted this claim. They insist that the object they saw was not a helicopter, but rather a strange craft that appeared to be transferring through a "light shaft" in the sky. The witnesses also told us that they have been here before, and many of them claim to have seen similar craft on previous occasions. The Air Force has asked us not to discuss the incident in detail, as they claim the report of the incident is still under investigation. However, we still have no report on what conclusions, if any, the Air Force has reached regarding this incident.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

1. In accordance with 78th Fighter Wing Supplement #1 to AFR 200-2, the following preliminary report concerning an alleged UFO sighting is submitted:

2. At 11:40 on 4 February, Mr. -, a resident of Santa Cruz County, California, (- -) called the Airman On Duty at this Headquarters and stated that he had seen a bright, stationary, orange object in the sky. He stated that he had information that might be of interest to the Air Force but would not give any further details over the telephone.

3. After repeated attempts to contact - by telephone on 8 February 1965, a report was made by me to determine what information he might have concerning this sighting. At his home at 11:00 on 8 February 1965, - stated that on 4 February, at approximately 11:40 a.m. he had observed a bright, stationary, orange object in the sky from a position about 2 miles from his home. He introduced several persons who stated that they also had observed the object out of curiosity. - was asked some leading questions about the object and its behavior, but he stated that he preferred not to discuss the matter further and referred me to the Hamilton Air Force Base.

4. Mr. - drove me to a spot on the beach about 2 blocks from his home where the space craft had landed and related the following:

At the time he awakes early in the morning, usually around 5:30, he works on his ham radio or takes "walks" on the beach. On this particular morning, as he was walking on the beach, he noticed the space craft at about 50 yards above the horizon on the ocean about 50 yards from the water's edge. It was about 50 feet wide and 30 feet high as it ultimately hovered.

Over the beach at about 1 to 2 feet of altitude. At this time the object appeared as a silver craft which had no visible means to calm. The space craft was of neutral color.
In his interview he stated frequently throughout that he was "real scared" as all times during his experience and can about 1970 feet in the sky but stopped when a voice had perfect clarity, no accent, and talked very slowly.
As the craft hovered about 100 feet to the ground, there was a flash which lit up the entire country side but there was no smoke or noise whatsoever. It became very quiet and the cause of curiosity and went aboard the craft through a sliding door.
as he entered the compartment he estimated was about 6 by 9 feet and was lighted very brightly from the ceiling and walls, it reminded him of a dressing room of another department. He entered and saw a man (owner of the voice earlier) sitting on something like a chair.
The spaceman looked like a perfect human specimen. He was very erect and had a strange face, no wrinkles or blemishes on face, perfect fingernails and had dark hair worn like a crew cut. He was wearing a garment which to the witness, looked like silvery Nylon.
The spaceman invited him to ask questions and so he proceeded to ask the following:
(1) Q. How did you evade our radar? A. The hull of our space craft has a material which will not allow a reflection of the penetration.
(2) Q. How is your ship constructed, what is your speed, what communications do you have? A. No answer.
(3) Q. Where are you from? A. Our home is on the other side of a planet which you can observe from Earth.
(4) Q. Are you human, but not of our type. A. Yes, we are human, but not to you but we are much more respectful to the Supreme.

Transcribed text from the document:

(6) Q. How far is your home from us? A. We are not in terms of miles or days. We operate in terms of light.
(7) Q. How long did it take you to get here? A. Many hours.
(8) Q. Have you been here before? A. Yes, to this place.
(9) Q. Why are you here? A. For exploratory purposes.
(10) Q. Have you ever been attacked? A. No, we have not this and you (11) Q. Are you alone? A. No, look out this special visitor with you, (this navigation draft observed to be long distance away and high in the sky and looked like the one he was in.)
(12) Q. Do you have means of attacking anyone? A. No, this craft is strictly peaceful.
(13) Q. How did you pick me for this experience? A. We have the first person on board this ship. We have invited many before but they were frightened away.
(14) Q. If I were a scientist could I have learned more on earth? A. No.
(15) Q. Have you ever tried to communicate with the countries of earth? A. No, we still had this tendency to attack without warning.
(16) Q. Will I ever see you again? A. We will return again. You will be undetected because we know the movements of your ships and your cloads cover. We can remain as long as necessary.
He was given a tour of the space craft and saw other space craft as the original spaceman was the only one that could speak English. During his new variations language he was not able to understand them. The spaceman told him that they have the same God as we do, but they call him something else. Also their bodies defy gravity and there is no disease, no hunger, no aging and no death. During the time he was aboard, the space ship took off and returned temporarily to another location but there was no chance of moving from one location to another. During his communication by spaceship language, they told him that they come from another galaxy and are part of a larger movement to monitor activities on earth.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE NEAR LA SELVA BEACH, CALIFORNIA ON JANUARY 8, 1965. IT WAS SEEN MOVING SLOWLY AT LOW ALTITUDE. SEVERAL SKETCHES WERE MADE BY WITNESSES. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SKETCHES.

Movement or noise during the flight. There were no loose items inside the craft and everything had anchored securely. 

It. At about 0450 on 30 January 1965 the space ship deposited back the craft landing above the surface of the earth and it had a highly polished smooth silver surface. 

During this time further study was resulting the above to me in these notes and provided me with drawings of to space craft (Atch 1).

Mr. appears to have a high school education, is on active duty in the Air Force, engaged in Civil Air Patrol and is currently employed as a staff sergeant. He appears to be very intelligent, reliable and responsible. He has had training as a radio repair business and lives in a comfortable home and drives 

Conclusion. Mr. is alluded to the fact that he is going to land and invite me to his location within approximately five days. There is a possibility of an attempt on Mr Pedrick's part to get the Air Force involved in a manner and a credibility.

Recommendation. That no further local investigative action be taken. This report be forwarded direct to AFSC (PDJ) which-ever is the proper organization, and action as required.
