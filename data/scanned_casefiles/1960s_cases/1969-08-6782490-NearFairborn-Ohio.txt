MEMO FOR RECORD                                                  21 Aug 69

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 19 Aug 69

1. On 19 Aug 69, Mr. [redacted] called TPRC (UFO) to report an unidentified flying object. He gave the following information on his observation:

Observers:     [redacted]
               Fairborn, Ohio 45324
               [redacted]
               Enon, Ohio 45323

Date of Observation: 19 Aug 69
Time of Observation: 0010 hours
Location:             Outside of Fairborn in hills.
Duration:             1 hour 27 minutes

Description:   The two boys were camping out when they sighted an object in the SW portion of the sky in a small clearing. The object looked like a bright light. The observers were approximately 10 miles from the object. The object was first seen behind trees. It moved upward from the trees to the right then took into the trees. The object turned white then yellow then red. Gossman said the object looked like a disc, but Foster said the object was far away and just looked like a bright light to him. The light was considerably brighter than the stars and house lights in the area. There was no smoke from the object. The object was solid and didn't seem to be a neon sign. There was no breeze at the time of the sighting, but there was slight breeze later. The observers were looking at the object through binoculars.

Comments:      Confusing and conflicting report.

2. Mr. [redacted] stated that he had reported a sighting about a year ago.
