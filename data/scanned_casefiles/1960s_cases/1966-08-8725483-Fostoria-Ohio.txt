Dear Sirs,

I have received a letter from the Air Force Dept. in Washington stating that you could not find the negative of the UFO photo I took. This doesn't really matter now, because a few weeks ago I was visited by a regional coordinator of the Colorado project. He is having some more negative made in Toledo as I receive one of them and another print of the picture, I will forward them to your office.

Dear Sirs,

Today I received a letter from NICAP stating that you did not receive a negative of the UFO photo I took. I am positive that I sent it to you. Perhaps it was in the bottom of the envelope where you could not see it. If you do have the envelope I sent back to you, check again.

If not, I will try and have another negative made from one of the prints.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter concerning a picture of a UFO. I know you have received a million letters just like this, but I felt obligated to mail you a copy of this picture. I am a general science teacher at Fostoria High School and acquired this picture from one of my students. He said he took the picture at about 3pm the third week of August on a clear day. If anymore information is needed just write to Fostoria High School Fostoria, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I regret to say that I was not made a negative for me. He has, however, made one for NICAP. Perhaps they will give it to you. I surely know strange it must sound because I have not given you a negative. I sent you the original one, but evidently it was lost in the mail. I realize that there have been many stories, and that these folks do not send you their negatives. If I had it in my possession I would gladly send it to you. I recently joined the CAPIC and have become their representative in Fostoria. I sent them a copy of my photo and Allan Zaging wrote me back and said that they were going to make a negative from it. Maybe the Canadians will co-operate and send you a copy, so you can either ask NICAP or CAPIC. I do not have one right now.

Yours truly,
Fostoria, Ohio
