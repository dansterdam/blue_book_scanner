Dear Sir:

It happened to be looking up when it saw a silvery object flying over me. At first I thought it was a jet, but then I changed my mind, I had seen other jets that same day and they did not look anything like that. It did look like a jet in some ways, it was going about the same speed as a jet, and it sounded like a jet, except after and left a vapor trail. But, unlike most jets it was seen it's a double away from it, & the craft itself was the size of a pea held at arm's length. It had 1 wings pointing in opposite directions, and a antenna sort of thing sticking out in front with some when it came on the bottom (see note enclosed).

It went behind the house & it walked away. It was on trying to see it, by this time it did see it was on flying more than a dot clearly into the sky, & drawn into my house and circled the time (12:10) (see note enclosed).

Please inform if you found out what it was. You are free to ask any other questions concerning the UFO.

Yours truly,
