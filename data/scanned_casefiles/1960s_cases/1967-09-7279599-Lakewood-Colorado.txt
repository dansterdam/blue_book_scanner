Here is the text I can discern from the document:

PRIORITY

2 Oct 67
@ 0358

32 SEP 67 12 49z

Somewhat illegible handwritten notes at the bottom right appear to say:
1st Air Policeman
will get message
from facing

The document has hole punches on the left side and appears to be a mostly blank page from an official document with some date stamps and markings.


- page 3 -

The only text I can clearly make out on this page is "Aug 08-2" near the left side of the document. The rest of the page appears to be blank or too faint to read. The document has hole punches on the left side, indicating it is part of a bound report or file.


- page 4 -

The only legible text on this page is "2:30 cm." in the upper right portion of the document. The rest of the page appears to be blank or too faint to read.


- page 5 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible. There is a large black redaction/censorship bar at the top of the page. The page appears to be a document with hole punches on the right side, typical of a standard file document. The bottom and top of the page have dark borders, and the page is a black and white scanned document.
