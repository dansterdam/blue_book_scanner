were tracked into a range of twenty miles where they both faded. Calculated speed A 800-5000 knots max. About 12 seconds after both radar targets faded from the scope, a single target reappeared at the point of fade and tracked out in the reciprocal direction. About five minutes later, another similar target entered the scope and was tracked toward the antenna for a distance of 30 miles. At 10 miles from the station, the target faded momentarily then reappeared at 10 miles bearing 100% and was tracked on this heading until it disappeared at maximum radar range (40 miles).

XI. Air Operations Officer's Comments. The circumstances creating this report were prompted by a phone call from a local radio announcer to the SIO at about 2000L on 8 January 1965 inquiring about a rumor from an unidentified and unidentified Navy source. The inquiry was based upon the rumor of events that had occurred at about 1930Z on 19 December 1965. Two of the observers immediately regarded the radar indications as an electronic freak and thought no more of it. The other observer discussed the incident freely with other members of the division. By 8 January 1965 the information had expanded to a joking situation. Until the time of the inquiry, knowledge of the events was limited to three RADC weatherboards plus other hearsay overhead "barracks or bar room type conversation". Until the time of the telephone inquiry, no apparent personnel had been made aware of the unusual sightings. Had this been done it is doubtful that any report would have been made due to the nature of radar presentations, investigations, and discussions with the air controller observers and others reveal the following additional information:

a. The CP-48A radar was not being peaked nor repaired by any technician. This radar had been routinely checked one day prior and was reported in excellent condition.

b. Only one repeater scope of the CP-48A was set on the 40 mile range. The other three scopes were set on the 10 mile scale and were not checked for similar data. The range settings on these scopes depended upon the circumstances and operator's desire.

c. The PPI-37 radar was checked to verify the signal but revealed nothing.

d. Each observer saw a radar signal. Though not one of them claims to have seen the entire group of signals, they saw collectively, they agree generally to the size, shape, direction, speed, range and fade of the signals.

e. All radar signals were tracked in a straight line directly toward the antenna or directly away from it. The signals indicated no turn. The last outbound tracking was claimed to have been only one observer who interpreted the change of location of indication after the DOWDG-CW-473-TWA aircraft was to be a turn.

5. No other radar at any location is known to have acquired similar data.

6. The observers agree they have never seen any radar target similar to the characteristics of this indication; they also agree they never witnessed interference of this nature.

4. The observers made no report initially because they felt there was nothing of significance to report.

i. The individual(s) who informed the local radio announcer is unknown. It is not felt to be any of the observers.

j. Information relating to this incident was released to the public from sources other than local shortly after the investigation started and long before it was completed.

The data presented by the information considered factual and statements by the observers indicate radar presentations of extreme size, exceptional speed and great brilliance. No maneuvers (turns) were ever observed.

The initial presentation on the scope was in the form of 2 oblong shaped indications preceding directly in a line toward the scope center. The other indication was positioned about 210° relative to the track. About 8 miles from the closer ones. The indications were tracked for 3 successive sweeps (six seconds per sweep). They appeared on three separate scopes at about 10 miles, 30 miles, and 20 miles at which point they faded. The next 3 successive sweeps revealed no information. The seventh successive sweep revealed a single indication at about 20 miles, then 2 remaining sweeps with indications showed it at about 30 and 80 miles respectively. The track was the reported of the Inbound track. About 5 minutes later another single indication showed at 40 miles. Three successive displays at it at about 30, 20 and 10 miles respectively. The next successive sweep showed it at a fade and the following 2 sweeps with indications showed it at 10 and 20 miles respectively and outbound and tracking about 100°N where it was last seen. The last two indications were noticed (reported) by only one observer.

The facts show a large indication moving toward the scope center and a separate indication at about 600 knots. More supposition would indicate while in the face a nearly instantaneous reversal of direction or an extremely light and rapid turn occurred, both without loss of speed. Although a logical explanation of the phenomena is not available, it is felt the indications were a false target due to temperature inversion, unusual interference created by other electronic devices, or merely a spurious return.

The basic delay in the submission of this report is due to inability to clearly establish a day and time of the occurrence. The two prior reports and unreviewed observers' notes on the data station similar in this report. However, this does not discount completely the claims of the younger observers.

M/R   5 Jan 65, Sightings (RADAR), at Patuxent Radar, Navy Missile Test Center, Patuxent River, Maryland on the night of 29 December 64 and 4 January 1964, Supposedly these nights.

First information received regarding these sightings was from Major Mason Jacks, SAFOI at approximately 0330, 5 Jan 65. Associated Press has a release of sightings. Sightings was by the Patuxent Naval Station, Patuxent River, Maryland. Radar track on 29 Dec indicated speeds of in excess of 4,800 mph also radar track on night of 4 Jan 65 indicated same thing plus having a 150 deg turn. We then called Public Information Office, at Patuxent, area code 301, 863-3111, ext 7450, Lt Vol. He said that a report had not been made to ADC. Also said that a time mentioned for the night of 29 DEC 64 was 130. We later found out it was 2030 local time on 29th, and 0130/30 Dec 64. He said that there was not much information on it as yet as they were in a conference regarding this matter. He is sending us, as info, a complete comprehensive report by Navy speed letter with SAFOI also info. Major Realson, DOD Press Duty Officer on the night of 4 Jan 65 apparently made news release. Lt Dvoranik, Chief Information Navy Officer in Washington had the same information that Lt Vol had available. Lt Dvoranik's numbers are OX 7 - 5342, OX 7 - 5343, at Pentagon.

Captain Bretthauer, ADC Liaison officer checked out info regarding ADC. This included checking some 30 radar sites in the same general area of Patuxent. Negative all the way. Also ADC did not have reports from Patuxent.

PIO's press desk was notified to see if anything had come over the wires regarding this sighting. Negative reply.

Call from SAFOI at approximately 1500 hours, 5 Jan. They indicated that report for 4 Jan targets was False.

Mr Steponius from the Journal Herald called Major Quintanilla, after duty hours, at his home requesting information regarding this sighting. Told him that we had not received a report on this as yet.

At Approximately 1630 hours Major Quintanilla, also received a call from Major Mason Jacks. He told Maj Jacks that there was no additional matter.


- page 9 -

M/R   6 Jan 65

Called Major Mills, meteorological liaison officer, and requested weather data for hours of 2030, 29 Dec 64 to 0130, 30 Dec 64, local time at Patuxent.
He will try to obtain this data today.

Contacted Captain Bretthauer and requested an official TWX from ADC giving the checkout of the 20 radar sites in the area which was given over the phone on 5 Jan 65.

Major Gregory from AFSC (SCF) called. People there were bugging him regarding this sighting. Told him we did not have an official report as yet and that information of this type should be obtained from SAFOI, Major Jacka. Also mentioned to him that ADC did not have any tracks in that area.

At approximately 1115 we contacted Lt Vol. at Patuxent. The investigation board was in session all day yesterday, 5 Jan. Therefore, speed letter was not sent out. The reports that were released are quite inaccurate. Much conflicting data. Speed was more likely 2400 knots. The ground electronics people were still checking the radar out and the reports. The report had evidently started by a rumor with someone (youngster) talking about town and laughing about it. He suggested that interest in the area was provoked by this being the first report of this nature at that station and also by the article written by (Major) Mr Donald E Keynes in TRUS Magazine in Jan 65.

People from town requesting information on this called. They were told-that-this-was-completely. They were told that there was no information at all on this matter. Lt Vole at this time told Information Office in Washington (Navy) that this was a completely unconfirmed report. For at this time the information he had was quite scanty. As of 1115 no technical report (analysis) had been made. And that information provided at first was conflicting, inaccurate and in error. He will call us back this afternoon regarding this matter and for additional information.

At approximately 1130 we notified SAFOI (Sara Hunt) of the above conversation and gave her the above information.

FTD's press service (Ann Henry) gave us an extract from the wires, pertaining to this sighting. They will continue to look for more information.


- page 10 -

11 Jan 65 - Received Msg from Patuxent at 1100 hrs. At 1130 received a call from Lt Volz at Patuxent asking if we had received as yet. Told him we had just received the message. A preliminary analysis was made from this message by Vincent D Bryant, GS-14, Electronics Engineer, FTD, TDEE.

At 1145 we gave preliminary analysis of what was suspected to SAFOIL over phone.

1 Jan 65 - Received Navy Speedletter, at 1000 hrs., # Lt Volz called at 1035, he was at Patuxent-Patterson refueling and will be here for approx 45 minutes, wanted to know what we thought about report. We called him back at 1100 hours.

At 1110 Navy Commander called regarding Patuxent Speedletter, he gave the correct time of sighting. Also told Major Quintanilla this time was confirmed by a reply of tapes. At 1130 we submitted Navy report to Mr Vincent Bryant for radar analysis. At 1145 Sara called requesting analysis. Informed her that we expected the analysis to be completed between 1330 and 1400 hours.

At 1400 hours we called Sara and gave her analysis. She called us at 1410 requesting that Major Quintanilla submitted a draft for a news release regarding the analysis. At 1515 we phoned SAFOIL and gave the suggested news with SAFOIL. ^

13 Jan 65 at 1130 final press release from SAFOIL was received.

14 Jan 65 at 0800 hours we submitted a copy of the Navy report and Project Blue Books report on the analysis of the Patuxent NAS sighting to SAFOIL.

1. Based on results of a Navy Investigation and analysis of the information supplied to Project Blue Book, it has been determined that the target reported by the Patuxent Naval Air Station on 29 Dec 1964 was not a valid target. Shape and illumination of the target indicates that the target was created by some other electronic device within the station or was caused by intermittent abnormality within the circuitry of the radar set itself.

2. A check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent and with adjacent radar sector centers on the east coast revealed no unidentified targets.

Patuxent NAS, Maryland
29 December 1964

Based on results of an investigation by the Patuxent NAS and analysis of information supplied to the Air Force by the Navy, it has been determined that false radar targets were mistakenly reported as unidentified flying objects on 29 Dec 64. Study of the shape and illumination of the return indicates that they were created by some other electronic device within the station or were caused by an intermittent abnormality within the circuitry of the radar set itself. This conclusion has been further verified by a check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent NAS and with adjacent radar sector centers on the East coast which revealed no corresponding radar return on that date.

29 December 1964

...on December 29th, radar operators at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Maryland, reported an observation of two unidentified objects which came onto their scope at 4,000 miles per hour, at a distance of 30 to 40 miles. The objects approached the naval air station, executed a tight turn, and disappeared from the scope. The fastest aircraft is said to be the X15 experimental plane, which has a top speed of 4,100 miles per hour. It is based on the West Coast and has a very short range...

1. Reference your telephone request of 6 January 1965.

2. The attached radiosonde plotted data is representative of the Patuxent area for your time of interest. There are two inversions. A low level inversion of 8 degrees Celsius exists from 2000 to 3000 feet. The upper level inversion refers to a shallow (approximately 500 feet thick) moist layer around 21000 feet. Unusual propagation effects could be created by either of these layers.

NO UFO OVER VIRGINIA - MARYLAND?

The Air Force is investigating the reported sighting of two high-speed UFOs by Navy Radar operators at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Maryland.

The radar operators observed "two objects on their scope approaching at approximately 4,800 m.p.h. from 30 to 40 miles north" of the base at 8:50 P.M. December 28, 1964 (Cleveland).

That would put them over the mouth of the Rappahannock River in Virginia (38 degrees latitude).

One of them made a 180 degree turn in five miles, a lighter radius than any on record, and was moving at 30 knots. What happened to the other big was not mentioned.

NO UFO SAYS THE AIR FORCE

The Navy passed on the report to the AF at Wright-Patterson Base, Dayton, Ohio. Meanwhile the Maryland press kept asking UFO questions all over Virginia.

"False radar returns," the AF said. A study of the shape and the illumination of the radar blips the announcement said, indicated they were created by some other electronic device within the station, or by interference, or by some other trouble in the radar. Nobody else on the East Coast got any similar blips, it said.

Editorial Comment:
"Nobody can report any claims blip," the AF said.
For now we'll accept that, but future "breaks" may tell a different story. Why didn't the trained personnel at Patuxent Naval Air Force recognize the electronic interference, etc., for what it was?
If it was? Why did they release the report without checking first?
Why did they release the report at all?
