Mysterious Objects
(Continued from page 1)

clouds moving. When I looked a
little closer, I could see that they
were not stars, but they were
a little larger. They were spread
out in a large area.

"They were moving pretty fast.
They all moved a little faster and
stayed in the same formation
until they were out of sight. We
watched them until they moved
out of sight."

Bill Napier of Whipple, who was
at the Ellison home, also saw
them and husband George got
outside in time to witness the objects before they faded away.

George Ellison called the Tribune last night to look for "satellites" outside. However, our attention was attracted to something different—probably a star. We thought, however, that the object was moving and had a green tinge to it.

After checking with Ellison again over the telephone we learned that it took approximately five minutes for the three "objects" to pass across the horizon. Ellison said they were brighter than stars.

About 7:04 p.m. a 72-foot Scout rocket had veered off its path high above the Atlantic Coast Friday night, two minutes after launching and had been destroyed.

The Scout rocket attained an altitude of 800 miles and landed in the Atlantic 1,500 miles off the Virginia coast.

Earlier Friday at Cape Canaveral, Fla., the first operational prototype of the Intercontinental Ballistic Titan missile veered sharply out of control and had been destroyed about 300 feet above its launching pad. It is not known what time this occurred.

The Ellison's, actually, distinctly saw objects about 8:55 p.m. We intend to send this account to the Air Force for their records.

Only a few weeks ago Ivan Wilcox and his brother at Mullens spotted an extremely strange object in the sky. It was purple in appearance and was only seen for a few seconds. The object's description was reported to proper authorities by a man a number of miles away in West Virginia. Then Air Force investigated the sighting.

Anyway, all eyes were turned toward the skies Friday evening. Earlier the city of Oak Hill was shaken by a loud noise which zoomed overhead as Oak Hill residents were eating dinner.

The sky truly is a mystery. Those folks from Mars are going to have a hard time—these days—you just wait and see.

Mysterious Objects Seen In West Virginia's Skies
(Continued from page 1)

What were the mysterious objects which passed over Oak Hill shortly after 8:30 p.m. recently? This is the account as told by George Ellison, residents on Sunnyside Drive, Oak Hill. It was there that he, his wife, children and Rose, and her nephew, Jimmy (Continued on page 7)
