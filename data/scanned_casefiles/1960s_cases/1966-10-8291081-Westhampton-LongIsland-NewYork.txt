11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
On several nights in succession the witness saw a bright light in the western sky. The object appeared to be white, red, and green in color. The object just hung in the sky for a long period at least a half hour before dropping below the horizon. This flashing light was observed for several nights. The object looked like a rotating light during the observation. On one of the above nights, the witness and others saw several red lights in the western sky moving at great speeds. At one time a white light hit a red light and the red light then veered northward. On other nights similar lights were seen by the witness. Arcturus was at an elevation of 9 degrees and on an azimuth of 250 degrees on the night of 27 Oct. 66. The star would have set at approximately 1915 EST on the 27th of October. Other descriptions are consistent with that of aircraft.

[Handwritten at top: "def'l" and "27 31 oct Westampton N.Y."]

November 7, 1966

Attention, Capt. Craig
Public Relations Office
Suffolk Air Force Base
Westhampton, N.Y.

Dear Sir:

In accordance with our telephone conversation this morning I am sending a resume of what I have seen recently, and with it a copy that you may forward to Wright Patterson if you feel it is substantial enough. I would like you to send it.

I think there are a lot of level-headed, honest people who are seeing unfamiliar lights. If they continue to have the treatment of ridicule from the press and radio they will become silent and that avenue of information will be closed to investigators. In the other hand there are probably nervous or hysterical people who imagine movement of stars etc.

As for myself, I have studied the stars and sky a lot and often just stand out in my back yard to enjoy the heavens and the hand-work of the Lord. These sightings of mine are the first I have seen out of the ordinary.

If the Air Force doesn't really know what the unexplained lights and objects are, I hope they will be bold enough to admit it. They seem to be trying to hush the people up, which would tend to believe that they do know what the objects are and want to keep secret.

The people, to believe the Air Force knows, as that planes are not sent up to intercept the lights, together.

Sincerely,

[Signature area blacked out]
Westhampton, N.Y.

A Resume of What I have seen in the Sky over Westhampton Area

Oct 27, about 8:10 E.D.T. as we passed the Cocoa-cola plant on the Riverhead Road.

I saw a bright light in the west, appearing to be near the hills back of eastport, a second light, red in color was travelling north, the white one being stationary. When the red light appeared to be near the white light it seemed to swoop down nearly sitting it and the white light went straight down and out of sight and the red light veered upward, picked up speed and at a great rate of speed went northward. Four of us were in the car, and this was reported to Suffolk Air Base.

Oct 28 7:20 E.D.T. a brilliant light was in the west as I looked from my house on Westhampton. It appears white and has a regular interval of red and green light, which at this distance seem to be a sort of rotating light. It hangs in the sky for a long period at least a half hour then drops down and after two downward plunges disappears.

I saw the same thing several other nights, and one night I know was on Friday, Oct. 21 at about the same time as I was coming home from grocery shopping.

After I got home from shopping the eve of 28th, my son wanted to go over to WAPC at Riverhead, so we went the lonely Speonk to Riverhead road to see if we saw any more lights. He did. A brilliant cylinder shaped light seemed to drop from out of nowhere about 500 ft. From the right side of our car as we were about half way from Speonk to Yorch-Riverhead Road. I know it was not a reflection as we had the low lights on.

Oct 29, I saw the same light as above, red, green and white in the western sky. Also in the western sky were tiny red lights travelling at an unbelievable rate of speed. They were going north and suddenly shot straight up. I had called my son out to see if he could see them too, and he did. Time about 7:30 E.D.T.

At 8:15 I was outside as a guest had just left and looked to the South. The familiar bright star was there, a little to the left of the light pole in front of my house. I expect that's the famous Dog Star). When suddenly I saw another light the same height and approximately the same size to the right of it. While I watched it thinking 10h, another star it started moving slowly in the direction of the stationary star and when nearly at the same position suddenly the light went out and a tiny red light was visible which shot straight up into the sky.

Oct 31, 6:15 S.T. The same brilliant, red, green and white light in the west.

I used to be a plane spotter during World War 14 and am familiar with airplanes, and certainly with their lights, since I live right near the Suffolk Air Base, as well as having worked there for nine months. At no time that I have seen the unfamiliar lights in the sky, have I heard any sort of plane noise.

Ceiling:

Visibility:

Amount of cloud cover:

Thunderstorms in area and quadrant in which located:

Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

NEXT CALL THE COMBAT ALERT CENTER, EXT. 493, FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

Was radar sighting made? By whom?

Was intercept action taken?

Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting.

FINALLY, CALL GRUMMAN AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS SECTION AT 727-1500, EXT. 611, TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD ANY AIRCRAFT FLYING WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING.

Do not discuss the report with any civilian callers. Only the Office of Information, Hq. USAF, is authorized to release information concerning UFO reports.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your OI report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
