Information which you feel is pertinent but which is not adequately covered in this questionnaire. Alternatively, provide a narrative explanation of the sighting.

This aircraft is the largest I have ever seen. It was brightly lit, with an almost circular shape, like a huge disc or saucer. It seemed to be slowly heading northward at a very low altitude, around 300 feet or less, almost silently except for a slight hum. The object was observed for about 60 seconds before it disappeared from sight behind trees. The size of the object was estimated to be around 100 feet in diameter.

Text from the document:
"15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS CHANGES IN POSITION, BRIGHTNESS, AND INDICATE PARTICULARLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

The angular size was a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp. Note how much of the object appeared to be the size of the full moon, if you had been able to perform this experiment at the time. Estimate what fraction of the total head and torso size the object appeared to be.
