Sept 30, 1968

Dear Sir:

I've sent a letter to John F. Kennedy Space Center NASA on August 28, 1968 about a UFO sighting I got a letter back today and they told me they had sent it to the wrong place. They told me to write to you. I don't have a picture of the UFO that they did not picture it. I will draw a diagram on the back of page. It could be some help.

I will be to please if you will do a big favor if you will get and please write back and tell me what you think. I thank you not much.

[Several lines are blacked out/redacted]

Folcroft, PA.
