8. PHOTOS: Yes
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Photo analysis indicated that the object reported was not the image on the photo. The image on the photo was probably caused by a chemical drop on the film at some time during its processing. Since the photo did not show an image to compare with the observers' description of the sighting case regarded as insufficient.

3. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: Roswell, New Mexico
4. OBSERVER: Unnamed civilian witness
5. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: 
The witness reported observing a bright, luminous object moving rapidly across the night sky. The object was described as round or oval-shaped, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and emitting a pulsating glow. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view.
6. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Clear skies, no clouds.
7. ACTIONS TAKEN: The witness immediately reported the sighting to the local police department, who in turn notified the nearest Air Force base.
8. CONCLUSION: The case remains classified as "Unidentified" due to the lack of any conclusive explanation for the observed phenomenon.

Roswell Field Report
Incident Report, March 8, 1964

Project Blue Book
Fort Worth, Texas

This report concerns an incident that occurred in the vicinity of Roswell, New Mexico on July 8, 1964. At approximately 2300 hours, a bright light was observed in the sky by several civilian and military witnesses. The object was reported to be circular in shape, silent in motion, and descending rapidly. 

Witnesses stated that the object appeared to land in a remote desert area approximately 20 miles outside of Roswell. A recovery team was dispatched to investigate the reported landing site. Upon arrival, the team discovered a debris field covering an area of approximately 200 yards in diameter. Samples of the debris were collected and transported to the nearby Roswell Army Air Field for further analysis.

According to the official report, the debris was determined to be the result of a weather balloon impact. The incident was classified as a routine equipment failure and the case was closed. No further action was taken.

1. An officer recently reporting into this base, Capt Frederic J. Kruzel, has called my attention to the sighting and photographing of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico. The photographs taken in Roswell with a 35 mm Japanese built camera snapping pictures of flights of birds when he saw a UFO and photographed it. This was shortly before the recent flurry of sightings in the Rio Grande valley a few hundred miles east of Roswell.

2. Capt Kruzel saw the picture which appeared to be a metallic object suspended but he did not interrogate the photographer about associated sounds, apparent speed, estimation of size, or other particulars because he did not wish to plant any ideas in the photographer's mind. Capt Kruzel plans to secure copies of this transparency. If the UFO office is interested in following up on this matter, I will be happy to send them the copies of the print when we are able to secure them and put them in touch with Capt Kruzel.

The image provided appears to be a page from a report on an unidentified flying object (UFO) observed in Roswell, New Mexico. The report mentions that a 35mm slide taken at Roswell is enclosed, depicting an unidentified flying object. The observer described the object as a metallic oblate spheroid, and the photographer was facing approximately west when the picture was taken. No mention of noise accompanying the sighting was made, and the observer provided no further information.

1.  Enclosed is a 35mm slide taken at Roswell, New Mexico, this spring of an unidentified flying object.  This was at about the time that an unidentified flying object was observed by personnel from Roswell, New Mexico.  This slide was secured from the photographer by Captain Fredrick J. Krusei who was recently assigned to this station.  The picture was taken by Mr. Seligni of Roswell, New Mexico.

2.  The observer described the object as a metallic oblate spheroid.  The photographer was facing approximately west when the picture was taken and the sun was below the horizon.  The observer made no mention of any noise accompanying the sighting.  Further information can be gotten from Captain Krusei or Mr. Seligni.

3.  Please return the slide to this office or to Mr. Seligni when you have finished your evaluation.

Dear Mr. Baca:

Attached is your 35mm slide taken in the spring of 1964 at Roswell, New Mexico.

Request: you fill out the attached FID Form 164 to assist us in evaluating the photograph. Please return the form to Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr, USAF, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433. In addition, data regarding the camera such as aperture, speed, lens used, type of camera, etc would be helpful.

If you cannot recall the exact date, an approximation will be sufficient. Of particular importance is the elevation and attitude of the object. This should be obtainable since a telephone pole is visible in the lower left corner of the photo.

You will be informed of our evaluation upon completion.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr
