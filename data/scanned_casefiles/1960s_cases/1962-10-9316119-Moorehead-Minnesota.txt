Here is the text from the document:

POSSIBLY A NEGATING SATELLITE. THE ACCURACY OF TIME AND ALTITUDE INFORMATION IS QUESTIONABLE. AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT AND WEATHER SOURCE WERE INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLE CORRELATION WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS, ALONG WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LT HERBERT R. PORTER (ANG FARGO) FAILED TO LOCATE THE SECOND WITNESS, OR OTHER WITNESSES. THE FIRST WITNESS WHEN CONTACTED INITIALLY BY THIS OFFICE, DISPLAYED A BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. 1. NONE.
