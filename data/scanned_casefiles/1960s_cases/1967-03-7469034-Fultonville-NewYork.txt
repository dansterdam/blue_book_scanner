35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I just heard a beautiful glow while going out on the porch for a visit with my neighbor. Something was descending and seemed to just glide silently without a noise. It was a big bright light that seemed to float along with no visible means of propulsion. The glow was bright but not blinding. It was a clear night and the object was quite visible. It seemed to be searching or looking around in the area. After a few minutes it suddenly shot up at an almost straight angle and disappeared from sight. The experience was quite unexpected and startling. I had never seen anything like this before.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20330

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

MAY 29 1967

Dear Mr. _______,

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation on March 30, 1967.

Detailed investigation revealed that you probably saw the chemical clouds produced by your complexion of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at approximately 7 p.m. EST, March 30, 1967, released from the WSMR atmosphere. This caused the clouds to become various colors, but eventually they burned blue in elongated patterns along the lines of the earth's magnetic field. The clouds may extend across the sky for several hundred miles and can be visible for thirty minutes to an hour.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

Utica, New York 13503

What about that mysterious red ball that we saw on the N.Y. State Thruway and was even seen in Utica by a few observers? Please send reply. Thank you.

Proposed reply to UFO report from March 30, 1967

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation on March 30, 1967.

Detailed investigation revealed that you probably saw the chemical clouds mentioned in your completed questionnaire. A rocket fired from the Wallops Island, Virginia, station of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at approximately 1900 EST, March 30, 1967, released tri-ethyl borane and barium into the atmosphere. This caused the clouds to become various colors, but eventually they turned white and dissipated. The clouds may extend across the sky for several hundred miles and can be visible for thirty minutes to one hour.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[redacted]

The image contains a newspaper clipping with text. The text describes an unidentified object that appeared in the sky, which was initially a very bright light and then seemed to be covered by a cloud. The article mentions that the moon was not visible at the time the object was seen. There does not appear to be a photograph in this document.

Text output from the document:

Utica Press reporters last night received three reports of large orange ball along the Southern horizon. The reports came from West Winfield, Whitesboro and New York Mills. 

The object appeared to be larger than the moon. It first appeared as a very bright light and then seemed to disappear as if being covered by a cloud. It then reappeared very bright and seemed to explode.

Kenneth Davis, West Winfield Press correspondent, identified the object shortly before 7 p.m.

The Old Farmers Almanac said the moon would rise at 5:28 a.m. today. It reported that the moon set at 5:56 p.m. and would not have been visible at the time the object was seen.
