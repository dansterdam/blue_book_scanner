The image appears to be a data table with multiple columns and rows. The text is repeated multiple times across the page, creating a grid-like pattern. The columns seem to include:

- Time (with entries like "PM", "AM")
- Date (with entries like "JAN")
- Location (with entries like "NORTH OF CITY", "NE", "SE")
- Degrees and other measurements

However, due to the low contrast and repetitive nature of the document, many specific details are difficult to read with complete certainty. The text appears to be from a meteorological or observational log, possibly related to a UFO sighting report from College Park, Maryland in 1963, as suggested by the filename.
