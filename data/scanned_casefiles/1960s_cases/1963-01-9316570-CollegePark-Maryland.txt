The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a record card from Project 10073, which seems to be a Project Blue Book document. The text on the card provides details about an observation that occurred on 8 January 1963 in College Park, Maryland. The observation lasted 3-5 minutes and involved one object. The conclusions section notes that the object was not contributing to a cause, except for possible distorting or disturbing effects, and that no information was presented which conflicted with the analysis presented, which was possibly with an afterburner.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document titled "JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CONTINUATION SHEET" classified as "UNCLASSIFIED" and dated January 9, 1963. The document provides a report from the 1001st AB WG, ANDREWS AFB, WASH 25, D.C. regarding a sighting of an observed object, where the Washington ATC Center contacted at 0509Z, had no knowledge of air traffic or unusual radar returns at the time and vicinity of the sighting. The document states that the assistant to the chief of operations and training, 1001st Operations Group, witnessed dozens of students observing the object, but the forecaster was skeptical about inversion causing the phenomenon, and no conclusion as to the cause or identity of the object was made.
