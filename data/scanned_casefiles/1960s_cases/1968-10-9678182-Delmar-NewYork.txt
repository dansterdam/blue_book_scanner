Dear Mrs. [redacted]

This replies to your letter postmarked October 15, in which you state that you have seen an unidentified aerial object.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another unidentified flying object (UFO), please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force unit. The nearest one to Delmar is the 556th Radar Squadron at Saratoga Air Force Station; if you will call the Station and ask for the UFO investigator or a flight extension 251 or 252, someone will take your report. The local UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-scene investigation, is usually able to achieve a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES E. ALKEN
Major, USAF

Dear Sir,

This morning at 3 A.M. I awakened to see a very strange sight. I watched for a momentary deep then with my husband. I had several colored lights (red, green, yellow and my slight white) which were very. It appeared to me the flight of it for over an hour, its which time it moved off and drew out remained gradually stationary. This husband fell asleep but I stayed awake for a half hour more. Then for a few minutes with myself. We did see again it was gone. We were going to call the police but were embarrassed and thought people would not believe us.
