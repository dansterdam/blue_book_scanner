NEWBURGH, NEW YORK, 6 APRIL 1967

On 6 April 1967 at about 6:50 pm EDT, Mr. Jack Bailie and Mr. Joseph Waskiewicz, both residents of Newburgh, New York, observed a bright red light in the sky south of Newburgh. The light appeared to be moving slowly and erratically. After observing the light for about 5 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.

Mr. Bailie and Mr. Waskiewicz reported the sighting to the local police department. The police department in turn notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Air Force. An Air Force investigator was dispatched to interview the witnesses.

The Air Force investigator determined that the object sighted was most likely a weather balloon. The witnesses, however, felt certain that the object they observed was not a weather balloon, as it did not behave like one. The Air Force investigation was closed with the conclusion that the sighting was of a weather balloon.
