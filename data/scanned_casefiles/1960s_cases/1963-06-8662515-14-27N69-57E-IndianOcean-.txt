Gentlemen:

With this letter I am sending you a memorandum and map depicting an aerial observation of a vessel at sea in the area of longitude 14-57E, latitude 27-29N on 29 June 1963.

At 1512 just a luminous disk was observed at an altitude of approximately 30 degrees above the horizon at 225 degrees true from the observer. It was descending vertically and was in sight for about three to four minutes from the time of the first sighting. When first noted it was a long tube and passed almost West of Polaris, disappearing behind what appeared almost directly below the horizon. It was visible with the unaided eye. It appeared to be traveling a little above the horizon. It gave the impression of a bright point of light. It was thought at first that it was a "star" but then it was observed to be cloud-like. However, it was observed to be passing through an area with no clouds but never changing its first appearance. About 30 minutes later, it passed through the same location. Three men were on the bridge at the time and all were bright against the above totals. An accompanying letter showing the approximate paths of travel of the unidentified flying object and comments will be made.

Very Truly Yours,

S/S Thetis
L. W. Fitzgerald, Master

[Most of the text is partially illegible due to the image quality, but I can partially make out some text. Some words and phrases are discernible, but not a complete continuous text. The document appears to be a typed letter or report with some sections blacked out/redacted.]

At the bottom of the page, I can partially read:

And at the very bottom, another partially legible line that seems to include a location and date.

The document is a black and white scanned page with a typewritten document, with some sections blacked out with black rectangles.
