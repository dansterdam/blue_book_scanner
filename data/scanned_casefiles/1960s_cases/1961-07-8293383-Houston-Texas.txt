UFO SIGHTING, BEAUMONT, TEXAS
20 July 1961

The following is a re-recording of conversation 20 July 1961 between Trans Texas Airlines flight 110 and Beaumont Approach Control by Beaumont, Texas, for the exclusive use of U.S. military Intelligence.

Runway 1182, winds calm, indicating northeast, over.

OK and do you have some kind of fast maneuvering airplane flying over Orange this morning? A couple of them? They are real shiney.

I have none reported in the vicinity of Orange.

Look out over the bay and just southeast of you some 6000 feet. Something real bright and shiny, it looks like it hovers for a while then it maneuvers real fast. It gets real, real bright then it gets dull. It doesn't look like an aircraft.

Roger, I will take a look and see what I can see.

Just look down there toward the high bridge and up about 6000.

long pause

I don't have any aircraft in sight. I have low cumulus between the airport and the high bridge. Possible the target or aircraft could be behind the cumulus where I couldn't see it.

It is just south of Orange. You probably can't see it. It is just as bright as a diamond. Looks like it hovers for a while then it maneuvers for about 5-6000 feet just within a second two.

Tell you what, I'll see if I can see it and if I do, I'll tell you. (G'll let you know)

You got radar down there? I'll see if I can pick up something.

pause

We are picking up two targets. One is southwest and the other one is south of Orange in the station here. It's not part of the ground clutter, and it doesn't appear to be any weather.

That is, roger, we got it sighted. It is not weather. It is almost hovering, and it is the brightest thing we have over-seen.

It is very maneuverable. We saw it once up about 5500 and it disappeared and about a minute later we saw it at at least 10,000.

It looks like it is down there about (?) What runway can you give us.

                                FLYING SAUCER ARTICLE

CALIFORNIA NEWBOY ATTACKED BY SEAGULLS: A Sacramento, California newboy claims an unusually wild experience. He was delivering his papers over his route, when suddenly the paper was jerked from his hand, ready to throw it over a fence. When suddenly the paper slipped from his grasp, and landed in a nearby hedge. A third paper was also jerked from his hand, at which time he felt a "something" but heard no noise. "I looked up," said Philip, "and saw two large birds that looked like flying saucers. One was larger than the other, and both were about 50 to 100 feet above the ground. The larger saucer was 50 feet in diameter, and the smaller one was 40 feet across. They came diving at him, seemed to go standing still. Two cases pictures of saucers, but these were different. They had lots of different sizes, some were different angles, like organ pipes of different lengths. Phillips plane-like-look off like a seabird dart, and went back later, encountered his brother and some other boys, none found them. The boy told his story to high Air Force officials, who apparently did not take it seriously, although they say they are investigating the incident.

Your note to President Kennedy of July 12th was referred to this office.

Although the Air Force does investigate all reported sightings of unidentified flying objects, it is our belief that this particular article from the SACRAMENTO UNION was published for its humorous aspects.

The attached fact sheet, "Air Force UFO Report", will give you an idea of Air Force findings resulting from analysis of UFO sightings. I hope it will be of interest to you.

'It's in Outer Space, How to Collect Now'
By DICK POLLORD
Staff Writer, The Union

Somewhere in infinite space has Phillip Wayne, 13, of Sacramento, Union block of Meadowdale. The time: magic evening hour of daylight and dark, a moonlight 5:50 A.M.

The Union's interstellar edition, although it was not so labeled by earth-bound editors who have time only for deadlines, was literally whisked away, as if by a silent vacuum or a magnet, from the disbelieving grip of a carrier for The Union Tuesday at dawn. And it seemed strange, too, to make of a flying saucer.

Do not laugh, jest, scoff or raise a cynical eyebrow above the fact, as some earth-bound editors believe in flying saucers! How, then, can you believe in the reality of your coffee break? Phillip Wayne believes.

NO PAPER
Read, earthling, of the experience of Phillip Wayne, 13 years of age, a youth with a talent for piping your Union against the door without waking you.

Phillip said he was delivering the Union's interstellar edition to the Circle block of Meadowdale. The time: magic evening hour of daylight and dark, a moonlight 5:50 A.M.

"I reached my hand over my head to throw a folded newspaper. There was no paper in my hand. I thought I had missed and reached out for a second paper. The same thing happened. When the third paper was jerked from my hand, I felt a suction, but heard no sound."

"I looked up," said Phillip, "and saw two things that looked like flying saucers. One was larger than the other. But were about 50 to 100 feet above the ground.

STRAIGHT UP
"And those newspapers were coming straight up to those saucers."

The larger saucer was 50 feet about 30 feet across, said Phillip, and seemed to be standing still. "I seemed to be standing still," said Phillip, in a somewhat whisper. "Now (Please see Page 7, Col. 4)

(Continued from page one)

I've seen pictures of saucers, but these were different. They had lots of corrugated pipes, protruding from different angles, like pipes. Different lengths." What did Phillip do?

"I look off like a scared bird," said he. "Later I went back, counting for the missing papers. I found only attack three times. There were three of them."

Phillip told his story to high air force officials. They listened. And they gave him "security clearance" to tell the Union about his experience.

Temptation to satisfy curiosity resists the youth. That point of the book or the inhabitants of Venus, did not close the New York Times, Washington Post, London Times, or just any Sacramento newspaper. It is sufficient to say; they chose the Union.

HOW TO COLLECT for three morning Sacramento Union ion carriers, who reported the papers were jerked, one by one, from his hand early Tuesday.

The newspaper carrier says Air Force officials are investigating the incident.

reasons:

a. Investigation and checks with all agencies in the local area
indicated that the sighting over the southwest Washington area on

A fleet of UFOs appeared late one afternoon in July 1961 to an observer driving west along Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas, to Alamogordo, New Mexico. It had been raining in the mountains, and wind and dust storms had forced the driver to stop several times during his trip, but now the sky was shining between patches of dark cloud in the western sky. Driving toward the outskirts of Alamogordo, he started to see a V-shaped formation of huge saucers flying directly toward him. Stopping his car, he saw that they were glowing a deep red. When they had reached a point nearly overhead, they suddenly seemed to drop down toward the observer. Rapidly revising all his first estimates of size, height, and speed, he recognized their true identity. They were merely a group of tumbleweeds that had been carried aloft in the strong winds and were soaring past at a height of only 100 feet. Illumination from the setting sun had produced their weird reddish glow.

Dear Bill:

On my return from the western swing I find a sizable amount of accumulated flying saucer material. I want to thank you and Major Friesid, and Colonel Evans for all of the helpful material, including the suggestions for improving our chapters. Many thanks to all of you.

On my western trip I ran into a daytime sighting that was a honey. I was driving on Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas to Alamogordo, New Mexico, and I was in the outskirts of the latter city, having just turned west where the road meets the one coming from Las Cruces and the Holloman Air Force Base. The time was 4:00 p.m. The sun was shining, although the sky was heavily clouded toward the west. It had clearly been raining in the mountains and heavy dust storms had forced me to stop two or three times along the highway. I was suddenly startled to see a V-shaped formation of flying saucers heading eastward directly toward me. They appeared to have a reddish glow and were moving very rapidly. I had the impression that they were nearly at cloud level. They appeared me rapidly and suddenly seemed to drop in on me. I then realized that they were merely a grouping of tumble-weeds carried aloft in the heavy wind. They were, perhaps, some hundred feet over head. The weird glow was caused by the illumination of the setting sun. Keep this in mind for similar reports.

Mrs. Boyd and I have been struggling to interpret the famous Rapid City, South Dakota, case of 12 August, 1953. The report has so many features that are suggestive of the mirage of a star, that we have strongly leaned to that interpretation. The bright star, Capella, which happens to be circumcircular at Rapid City, was indeed very close to the horizon, just east of north. We do not have very good times or estimates of the total duration of the sighting. I wonder if you have any additional material that you could send us, in view of the importance that the UFO boys attach to this sighting. In particular, we should like to know what is the radius, in miles, of the radar screen and what was the frequency. The weather records indicate

that a very sizable temperature inversion was present, and this was ample to magnify some of the radar and optical effects. The radar, especially, could have been deflected back to the ground and the moving object might have been some secondary reflection from the plane itself. Is there any additional information about the man who claimed to have checked the UFO against the triangle of stars, and deciding that it moved with reference to those stars? Sounds that it might have been autokinesis, unless this motion was really very sizeable.

Our                 A study of the Whitted case indicates that the UFO was merely a meteor. Apparently this was a considered solution in the early days. We wonder why it was abandoned.

Thank you for the additional sightings, all of which are useful and lend freshness to the book. Also, I think you were going to send me one from the south, where airline pilots reported not only seeing a saucer but certain roughness of the air which, according to your own observation, was due to forest fire or oil well fire, or something of the sort.

Again, with our many thanks and best wishes, I am

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your letter of 14 January 1962 has been referred to this office for answer.

Neither of the specific sightings you mention were forwarded for record purposes because investigators at the initial reporting level were able to establish positive identification.

The sighting in the Chehalis-Morton area on 12 July 1961 was determined to be a SAC training refueling operation.

The sighting near Tacoma, Washington on 16 October 1961 was determined to be an F-105 aircraft from McChord AFB.

The enclosed copy of AFR 200-2 has applicable portions noted for your information.

Thank you for your interest and we hope the above information will prove satisfactory.

Sincerely,

The image appears to be a handwritten document page. However, due to the cursive and somewhat faded handwriting, much of the text is difficult to read with complete certainty. I can make out some words and fragments, but a full transcription would require careful examination. The page is numbered "167" in the top right corner, and the handwriting appears to be from an older document, possibly from the 1960s based on the filename context. The text seems to be a continuous narrative or report, written in a dense, flowing script across the entire page.


- page 29 -

The image appears to be a handwritten document with text on both the left and right sides of the page. The handwriting is cursive and somewhat difficult to read completely. The page is numbered with "112" in the top left corner and "197" in the top right corner. Due to the cursive nature and image quality, I can only partially transcribe the text:

Left side (partially legible):
- Begins with something about "from 1953"
- Contains phrases like "while in water spring"
- Mentions something about "United States"

Right side (partially legible):
- Appears to discuss some kind of observation
- Contains phrases like "might have been"
- Seems to reference some details about an event or observation

Some words and phrases are illegible due to the handwriting style and image quality. A full, accurate transcription would require closer examination or enhanced image clarity.

Here is the text from the document:

[Page numbers at top: 16 and (13)]

[The text appears to be handwritten and somewhat difficult to read completely. There are two columns of text. Some words and phrases are legible, but not the entire document. Two sections are blacked out with black marker.]

Left column begins with:
"we were with people
we every then moved one
seemingly to half and all
..."

[The rest of the text is partially legible but not fully transcribable with complete certainty due to the handwriting and image quality.]

Right column begins with:
"we especially do the similar

..."

[The document appears to be a handwritten report or narrative, but the full context and complete text cannot be definitively determined from this image.]

The image appears to be a handwritten document with text that is somewhat difficult to read due to the handwriting style and image quality. Some parts of the text are legible, but many words and phrases are challenging to decipher with complete certainty. There are also two black redaction marks on the bottom right of the page. The text appears to be a narrative or report written in cursive script, but without performing a full transcription, I cannot confidently reproduce the entire text.

On the right side of the page, there are some additional partially legible lines and some blacked-out sections. The text appears to be a handwritten account, possibly describing an unusual observation or event.

The image appears to be a handwritten document with text on both the left and right sides of the page. The handwriting is somewhat difficult to read due to the image quality, but I will transcribe what I can discern:

The document appears to be a handwritten report or account of a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sighting, with some text being difficult to read due to the image quality and handwriting style.

The image appears to be a handwritten document page. However, due to the handwriting style and image quality, much of the text is difficult to read with complete certainty. Some words and phrases are legible, but a full transcription would require careful examination. There are also two black redaction/censorship marks on the page obscuring some text. The page is numbered "16" at the top left corner and appears to be part of a larger document.

I do not think this is actually a "radar" sighting. The weather radar (on the ground) saw two targets at the general vicinity of the reported sighting, but I do not think you can reasonably assume that either of these is the bright target sighted visually.
