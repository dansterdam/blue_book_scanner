Incident No. 852-67

On Wednesday 3/8/19 67                     At _______ A.M. or 8:30 P.M.

Location: Briarcliff +
            Wedgewood

DETAILS: I saw a iridescent large red ball in the sky. At first all was standing still (over) Liggett School, up in the sky. But was larger than a total. Near it started moving to the west of the school. It circled back to the side of the school & seemed to come down about 2-00-300 ft. above Liggett School (level)

It looked like a airplane unit was crossing. It was only down about 200 ft. (up) & moved at that then it went up straighter & very hastily got the camera & I (with) two pictures (taken) & hope turn out.

After we took the picture it seemed to move right again, flashing brightly & then dim. About 5 min. total.

[Most of the form is filled out with handwritten text, but due to the image quality, much of the text is difficult to read clearly. The form appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric data collection sheet with various sections for time, type, boundary, clouds, radiation, turbulence, and other atmospheric measurements. The right side of the document contains a grid chart for temperature and other meteorological data.]

The text is largely illegible due to the low contrast and handwritten nature of the document. Some words and numbers can be partially made out, but a complete transcription is not possible without risking introducing errors.


- page 13 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

OF DEFENSE
log p DIAGRAM
FAHRENHEIT AND CELSIUS

The rest of the text is part of the diagram and includes numbers and labels such as altitude, wind scale, and various numerical values, but these are integrated into the technical diagram and not standalone text. The document appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric log diagram with a complex grid layout showing various measurements and scales.

Here is the text I can extract from the document:

FORECASTER

EXPLANATION
[Most of the explanation text is too illegible to reliably OCR]

At the bottom of the document, I can clearly read:

NUMBER    STATION    TIME (OCT)    DATE (OCT)
637        Ft.        0500 20/1147     1200 22 092

The document appears to be a meteorological chart with a complex grid of diagonal and horizontal lines, with various numerical annotations and markings. The chart seems to be from the "AERONAUTICAL CHART AND INFORMATION CENTER" as noted in small text at the bottom left of the page.


- page 15 -

Text found in the document:

Form: DOD-WPC 9-16-1
(Formerly AWS-WPC 9-16-1)

The rest of the text appears to be part of a complex grid chart with numerical scales ranging from 350 to 1000 on the vertical axis, and various temperature and other measurements on the horizontal axis. The specific details of the grid are too complex to transcribe fully.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

Spoke with Major Nyls concerning the photographs taken by the Major. Major Nyls said that he had the opportunity to view the photographs. The only object that appeared on the photos was a small street light located across the street in the direction of the UFO. Major Nyls said he went to the scene and did see the street light. He definitely believes that the object was not photographed but the street light was.
