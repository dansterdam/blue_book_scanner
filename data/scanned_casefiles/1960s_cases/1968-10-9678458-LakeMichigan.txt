Dear Sirs:

Recently while lookout on a Great Lakes ore boat, I sighted three UFOs. They were circular, about six inches in diameter from where I was standing, and were about the size of a silver dollar. They moved very fast and more erratically than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. One came in at about 12:50 A.M. and about 40 miles west of the Mackinac bridge at Lake Michigan. One was behind and to one side of the first one and another further back.

I hope this information will aid you in evaluating any concurrent sightings of this same phenomena. If you have any information or a clarification of what I observed, I would appreciate your comments.

Also, please send some information as to your past findings and evaluations.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
