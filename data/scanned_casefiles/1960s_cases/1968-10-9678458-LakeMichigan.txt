Dear Sirs:

Recently while lookout on a Great Lakes ore boat, I sighted three UFOs. They were circular, about six inches in diameter from where I was standing, and were about the color of floodlights. They were very high and moved very fast in approximately a NW to SE direction. The date was October 25, 1963 at about 12:50 A.M. and about 40 miles west of the Mackinac bridge in Lake Michigan. One was behind and to one side of the first one and another further back.

I hope this information will aid you in evaluating any concurrent sightings of this same phenomena. If you have any information or explanation of what these were, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Also please send some information as to your past findings and evaluations.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature is blacked out]
