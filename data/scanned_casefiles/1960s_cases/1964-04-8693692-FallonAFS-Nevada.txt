EVALUATION OF UFO REPORTED AT FALLON AFS, NEVADA

1. The length of time of the observation, coupled with the winds reported (50k at 50,000 ft) would make the possibility of a balloon seen unlikely, since the amount of lateral travel would be much greater than indicated. Equipment malfunction can reasonably be ruled out since the target was observed for a period of one hour and twenty-one minutes, this also makes propagation anomalies seem unlikely.

2. An extreme temperature inversion is a possible cause of the echoes, such a condition would explain the lateral travel for the time observed. The rapid height changes reported could be accounted for by atmospheric fluctuations. This is possible when it is considered that the elevation angle is low, less than 1Â°, and the total altitude change is only 6000 ft (a change in elevation angle of milleradin)

3. Since the type of radar used is not given, its capabilities can not be determined.

The text on this page is partially illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. I can make out some fragments, but many words are unclear or unreadable. The page appears to be a typewritten document with some handwritten elements, but the specific content cannot be fully discerned.

The only clearly legible elements are:
- A page number "4" at the bottom right of the page
- The first letter "F" at the top left of the page

Most of the text is too blurry or faint to accurately transcribe without risking introducing errors.
