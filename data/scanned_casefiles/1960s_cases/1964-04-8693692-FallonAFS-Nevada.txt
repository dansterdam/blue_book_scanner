EVALUATION OF UFO REPORTED AT FALLON AFS, NEVADA

1. The length of time of the observation, coupled with the wind reported (50k at 50,000 ft) would make the possibility of a balloon seem unlikely, since such a lateral travel would be greater than indicated. Equipment malfunction can reasonably be ruled out since the target was observed for a period of one hour and 55 minutes, which is quite a long observation time and not likely.

2. An extreme temperature inversion is a possible cause of the time condition, such a condition could allow small lateral travel for a lateral travel for a lateral mirror travel for an extended period. This is possible when it is a condition adjacent to the antenna is low, less than 6000 ft (a change in altitude of only 6000 ft).

3. Since the type of radar used is not given, its capabilities cannot be determined.
