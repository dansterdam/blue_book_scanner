MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 3 Aug 65

Maj Factorovy at Kirtland AFB, has been de'aged with many many reports of
unidentified flying objects. The majority of which are playing lights.

He requested permission to forward these reports as a unit on forms rather
than in a TWX, as stated in accordance with AFR 200-2. Tgt David N
Moody gave him a verbal okay.

He will forward these reports to our office. Also, he requested clarification
on release of information to the press by the Base PIO. Informed
him that UFOs as such are unclassified and that AFR200-2 provides for
release of evaluations through SAFOI. Its only for him to tell the press
that they are conducting an investigation and its okay to release
information on identified objects, such as known a/c, etc because they
are not unidentified.

1. In accordance with telephone conversation this date, attached are copies of information received on alleged UFOs. The weather at 2255 local was 700, scattered 12,000 broken, 50 mile visibility, temperature 64, dew point 57, winds 230 at 5 knots, altimeter setting 30.11.

2. I was unable to confirm any aircraft in the area, however, I feel that the sightings are probably over-flying aircraft in the area or cloud decks. This type of sky coverage is unusual in this area and there has been heavy UFO publicity that you are quite familiar with.

The information which has been filled out in this report pertains to the first sighting and not the second sighting in which I and these other people observed and reported to Holloman Air Force Base on the same night of one sighting.

A. First sighting - time - 9-7:30 p.m.
In this first sighting only one object was seen. The object when first sighted was traveling from a northern direction and gradually changed its an north eastern direction. As it began to move from the north direction the object began to rise higher and increase in speed. A light turquoise blue with an intermixture of white light was coming from the tail portion of the object. The object stopped moving for a short time once it got in an easterly position. It stayed in one position for about two-three minutes. During that time the turquoise-blue light went out and only a white light could then be seen. After two-three minutes the object then proceeded in a northern direction.


- page 52 -

B Second Sighting   Time- 16-10:30 p.m.

In the second sighting we observed few objects traveling in a regular flight formation.

These few objects also came from a southern direction but now changed to a north-western direction. These objects were in sight for about a period of five -odd minutes.
