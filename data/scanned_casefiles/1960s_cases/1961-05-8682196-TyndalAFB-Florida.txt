e. Formation - 2
f. Trail or Trail - none, but the two objects seemed to be in an oblique formation.

2. Description of Course of Objects:
While watching for the satellite "Echo" at 1945 hours, 9 May 1961 at Capehart Housing, Tyndall AFB, Florida, azimuth 250Â°, the objects seemed to be traveling in an oblique formation. I waited for a while to make sure they were not aircraft. I called T/Sgt. Cepperain (Cepperani?) and he said he had spotted them also. We watched them travel from Panama City, Florida to see if he had seen Echo or the other object. The satellite Echo had been seen and he expected it to pass again at 1945 hours. I thought these objects might be the satellite Echo but when I checked with T/Sgt. Cepperain (Cepperani?) he said he did not observe the UFO braking away from the satellite Echo over the Gulf. Captain Adamson and I saw the objects again. I saw no more. This is all I can provide.
