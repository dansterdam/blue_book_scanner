10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Size of grapefruit. Color similar to star. Seemed to be traveling in an orbit formation. Seemed that satellite Echo was being observed. Obj seemed to be coming on as of 250°. After it broke away on Echo Echo, it headed on a 215° az. 1st obj disappeared on a 25° heading. 2nd obj on a 150° heading. Both faded out.

11. COMMENTS
High angular velocity of high flying Jet a/c and of Echo are approx same. It is quite possible that a passing a/c was sighted and due to excitement misidentified or identified with Echo. Fact reports in witness in this case indicate that he becomes very excited when subj is UFO's. It is concluded that obj of sighting was probably a high-flying a/c.

Analysis and Conclusions: THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF HIGH FLYING JET AIRCRAFT AND OF ZERO ARE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME KIND OF IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS SIGHTED AND CONFUSED WITH ZERO. PAST REPORTS FROM THE WITNESS IN THIS CASE INDICATES THAT HE BECOMES VERY EXCITED WHEN THE SUBJECT IS CLOSE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY A HIGH FLYING AIRCRAFT.

Report on Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

1. Description of the Object:
a. Shape - slightly elliptical
b. Size - grapefruit
c. Color - similar to a star
d. Number - 2
e. Formation - 2
f. Tail or Trail - none, but the two objects seemed to be traveling in an oblique formation.
g. Unusual Features - It seemed that the satellite Echo was being observed.

2. Description of Course of Objects:
a. When I first noticed the two UFO's at 1945 hours, 9 May 1961, at Capehart Housing, Tyndall AFB, Florida, azimuth 250°, the two objects seemed to be traveling in an oblique formation. I watched for a while to make sure they were not aircraft. I called T/Sgt Joseph T. Terlesky (Capehart) and asked him to observe the UFO traveling over the Gulf. In the meantime, I called Mr. [redacted] Panama City, Florida to see if he had seen Echo or the other object. He said he had seen Echo about the same time I did and he expected it to pass again at 2045 hours. I then called Captain Allan E. Aaronson about the Echo and the UFO. After Echo and the other UFO had disappeared I checked with TSgt Terlesky to find out what he saw. He noticed the UFO breaking away from Echo but he did not observe Echo because I only requested him to watch the UFO over the Gulf. Captain Aaronson and Mr. [redacted] only saw Echo. I saw Echo twice and the other UFO.

b. Angle or elevation and azimuth of the two objects: See attached sketch. Object A seemed to be coming on an azimuth of 250°. Object B seemed to be coming on an azimuth of 250°, after it broke away from Echo and it headed on a 215° azimuth.

c. Angle and azimuth of object seemed to disappear on an approximate heading of - Object A (Echo) 25°, Object B 150°.


- page 4 -

d. Description of flight path and maneuvers of objects: The objects traveled as follows: Object A - southwest to northeast; Object B - southwest to southeast.

e. Manner in which objects disappeared: Faded out.

f. Length of time objects were visible: Object A, 20 minutes; Object B, I observed it for ten minutes and Sergeant Teresky for five minutes.

3. Method used in observation:
a. Ground - visual
b. Optical Aid - none
c. Aircraft used - N/A

4. Time and date of sighting:
a. Object A - 1945 hours, 9 May 61

On or about 1955-9 May 61 source sighting to be over Tyndall AFB and looks turned at about 1930 hrs noticed an unknown type object, moving simultaneously. I observed it for a few minutes and called Sgt Joseph P. Taulbee to watch it. In the noon time, I called the [redacted] A27 Magnesium and Panama City State of his same Sgt. and he did, also called Captain Allen Cameron and he also saw it. After that passed I later with Sgt Joseph P. Taulbee and the same time noticed the object. I was just a point but did not see the were observing the other object.

On or about 2000 hrs 9 May 61 - this was clear to here again. I did not be the anyone, so I was that had time.
