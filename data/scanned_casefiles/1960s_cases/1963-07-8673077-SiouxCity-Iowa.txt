8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
West

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One white object flashing high-intensity light every 5 seconds in flight on course or 230 degrees observed for maximum of one minute at which time object disappeared over the horizon. No maneuverability. Path of object followed by estimating position of next flash to 4/5 pickup on radar could account for object. Estimated object at high altitude.

11. COMMENTS
Description of flash indicates strobe light of a/c. Duration of sighting indicates speeds consistent with jet a/c operations. Nothing to indicate threat to security of US. RBS site at Scenic Badlands, South Dakota is on heading of 230 deg from point of observation. Possible usage of this target. Nothing other than absence of radar pickup to indicate that was not an a/c observation.

□ Was Aircraft
