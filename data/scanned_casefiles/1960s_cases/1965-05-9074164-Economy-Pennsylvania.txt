REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information,

TO: Hq USAF SAPOI-CO (Mrs Hunt)
Wash D C 20330

Reference the attached letter from requesting
Information on unidentified flying objects and reporting a
UFO observation. The following information is provided in
order that a reply may be made:

a. The present head of Project Blue Book is Major H
Quintanilla, Jr.

b. The incident referred to in Frank Scully's book,
"Behind Flying Saucers" is not based on fact. The Air Force
had no connection with this alleged incident. The Air Force
considers this incident and Mr Scully's book as science
fiction.

c. The Fact Sheet forwarded to Mr in January
1965 contained the conclusions of Project Blue Book to date.

d. We have no reports from the Pennsylvania area
on 27 May 1965. At this late date specific identification of
various aircraft in the area would be extremely difficult. The
sighting is similar in some respects to a conventional aircraft.
Characteristics of this sighting indicate that an aircraft
towing an electionally lighted advertising banner could be the
cause. Lights on these banners often give an appearance of ro-
tation.

Dear Sir:

I know you are quite busy, so I will not waste your time.
I am writing to you for two reasons: to request information
on a matter connected with Project Bluebook; and to report
a U.F.O.

* Enclosed you will find my report on the U.F.O. which was
sighted.

First of all I would like to know who is the head (in charge
of) Project Bluebook-investigation of Unidentified Flying
Objects. Secondly I would like to know more about the object
which was found near New Kenzio on or about July of
1949. It was referred to in Frank Scully's book "Behind
Flying Saucers" (Chapter 12, P. 147) copyright 1950.
This report tells of a saucer-shaped vehicle(metallic) whi ch
accidentally crashed there. It was also stated th t 16
corpses (each approx. 3 ft. in height) were found within.
The whole operation was surveyed by the U.S. Air Force,
I understand, but it never mentioned what became of the
craft or its dead occupants. I am very interested in this
case and would like to know more about it, what became of
the vehicle and the bodies, and what conclusions were drawn
by the Air Force officials that studied it.

I know you probably consider me a "curiosity seeker" but
I would appreciate it very much if you would send me the
requested information, as I am very interested in such
matters and study them.

I thank you very much for your time and any information whi ch
you can send me regarding this matter (not restricted for
Security measures). Thank you!

Yours tmly,
Baden, Penna. (15005)

U.F.O. SIGHTING REPORT

DATE(sighted): 27 May 1965

LOCATION: Economy Borrough, Pennsylvania (in vicinity of Baden-Economy Jr. High School and Conway, Penn.)

OBJECT at unknown altitude; first seen in direction NNE, proceeded in a Northerly direction, then to a point NW where it could no longer be seen.

TIME: approx. 9:40 PM. (EST--on Daylight Saving Time)--local

TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual

PHOTOS: none

SOURCE: civilian observers

LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: approx. 90 seconds

NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one(composed of several parts)

COURSE AND SPEED: NNE to NW; appeared to travel at high speed with periods of motionlessness.

DESCRIPTION: color appeared to be a glowing white. Object appeared quite large in sky, composed of 2 larger spheres--one at each end-with a number (3 or 4) of smaller spheres between the 2 larger ones. OBJECT WAS DISTINCTLY SPINNING OR ROTATING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. It was also tilted at approx. 150 angle(vertex at left end) as to show a 3-dimensional view.

COMMENTS: Observers (both age 17) on way back to parking lot of B-B Jr. High School activity program. Sky clear blue, dusk, after sunset, no clouds. At first glance, it was moon in final phases, but soon saw it was a revolving object. Calling attention to it, one remarked that he saw it suddenly appear a few seconds earlier. Both observed it clearly for about one minute. Aside: a man if he knew what it was or if he saw anything like it before. Answer: no. Strikingly feature was the clearly rotated distinctly at rate of 1 revolution every 2 seconds. Rushing to where he thought he used 7x50 binoculars to view object(now, less distinct) at a distance.

PERSONAL CONCLUSIONS:
First U.F.O. seen by either observer.
Both intelligent and normally skeptical,
honor students not associated with
hoaxes.

Highly unlikely object sighted was:
aircraft(though some were in the area);
one an advertising plane-not resembling
sighting; celestial body (star, moon etc.)
or balloon

I know we should have reported it to the nearest Air
Force Base, but was busy and unable to report before
present date.
