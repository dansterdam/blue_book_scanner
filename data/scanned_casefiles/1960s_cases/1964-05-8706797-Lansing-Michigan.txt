The locations from which the calls came were all close to the route of the police car. In this investigator's opinion, all the calls at or around 0300 on 21 May may be attributed to the police-run.

Was it Martians?
Odd Sound Linked to Sky Object

By DICK FRAZIER
Journal Staff Writer

The clock in Mrs. Elizabeth Hoxey's living room struck three as she was awakened by a strange "noise" Thursday morning.

• Others reported hearing the sound on the city's south side during the next few minutes.

Mrs. Hoxey, of 6035 Hillard St., called city police to report she had heard a noise "like something from outer space."

About the same time, Mrs. Edward Cole, 4623 Hughes Road, and her daughter, Wanda, 10, were awakened by a noise she later described as a high-pitched "whirling sound."

"It was terrible and it lasted for more than five minutes," she said. "It was a very loud, very shrill sound, steady for quite a while and then it drifted away."

The story, of course, has an elephant angle — and city police, investigating a similar noise report at 1008 W. Dunlap St. — at first believed the noise was coming from a trumpeting elephant near the Logan Shopping Center circus.

NO ELEPHANT

But one elephant couldn't make all the noise — and keep it up steady for five minutes. About a dozen residents living at least half a dozen blocks away as Depot Street in Holt, Elmer Speer, 1006 Dunlap St., said he had just gotten home when he heard the noise. "I know it was something," Speer said, "and I'd swear the darned thing landed or touched down someplace somewhere. The revolving muffled booming sound sort of slacked off, like a motor that has been turned off, and then it revved up for just a second and then quit."

Speer said he had seen a shooting star a few minutes before, but that was before he heard the noise.

Mrs. Cole was the only person who reported seeing anything connected with the noise.

"I was too scared to go to the window at first," she said, "but after I got my daughter settled down, I looked out toward Holt (to the southeast of her home) and saw this light-colored shiny, silver-metally thing. It looked like a great, huge bowl, sort of spinning. It was just over the tops of the trees and it kept moving away, not straight away like you'd think, but turning in loops as it disappeared."

OBJECT GLOWED

She said the object had a glow but no other markings or lights. Neither her husband nor son got up to look at the object, Mrs. Cole said, although her husband did hear the screeching noise.

Capt. Donald R. Knutson of 835 Sandlyn Ave. said the noise was heard about 3 a.m.

An army officer, Knutson is working on his master's degree in accounting at Michigan State University.

"At first I thought it was my furnace acting up again. Then I realized it sounded like a helicopter, but it was more compressed and sounded like a smoother running engine."

"I thought it was trucks on Cedar Street then I realized it lasted too long for them. I did not look out so I saw nothing."

"When I looked at the clock it was 3 a.m., and the sound was still there," he said.

The Ingham County Sheriff's Department had several phone calls this morning asking about the noise.

Whining Object in Sky Mysteries L...

LANSING - An "Unidentified Flying Object" reared across Lansing early Thursday, telling nearly a dozen and promising police to compare the high-pitched white to an elephant's trumpeting.

The bluish, circular object was described as "a great, big bowl, sort of spinning" and a "high-colored, shiny, ver metal thing."

Witnesses began phoning reports to Lansing police, radio and television stations shortly after the first sighting at 12:10 a.m.

Many of the sightings were in an area near the Logan Shopping Center at Jolly and Logan, on Lansing's northwest side.

A 16-year-old elephant named Tulsa is on display at the shopping center, and police told the first caller (to the sound) they might be Tulsa trumpeting. They changed their minds as calls poured in.

Don Weigandt, 30, a television newscaster in Jackson, first saw the object while driving to his East Lansing home along College Road.

"It was very blue, too blue to be a falling star," he said. "It was round, like a basketball, and was falling very fast. But I went to the spot where it disappeared, there was nothing."

Stanley Brauer, 40, and his wife, Blanche, were on their way home from the Lansing restaurant he owns.

"Its speed was terrific," Brauer said. "We tried to follow it but it was going so fast that it was gone, phfft! Just like that. It looked like it fell in Scott's Woods."

Army Capt. Donald Knutson, a graduate student at Michigan State University, said, "I thought it was a furnace acting up again. Then I realized it sounded like a helicopter (or) truck on Cedar St. But it lasted too long for that."

Elmer Speer, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I know it sounds crazy (but) I'd swear the thing landed south of my place."

"The revolutions sort of slackened off, like a motor that has been turned off. It revved up again for a second," Speer said. "The sound was a 'whirring noise' that started low and got so loud and high-pitched it near me."

One unidentified woman said she saw the UFO take off again.

Preliminary Investigation of UFO Reports, May 18 - 22, 1964.
WILLIAM T. POWERS, Systems Engineer, Dearborn Observatory

On Friday night, May 22-23, I made a brief telephone survey in response to a request by J. A. Hynek, "Director of Dearborn Observatory, following his appraisal of a UPI report of sightings in Lansing, Michigan.

My first call was to UPI in Chicago; a report of a UFO sighting had come in, but from Marion, Indiana. A subsequent call to UPI in Lansing established that reports were coming independently from both locations.

I contacted the Police Department in Marion, and was informed that police officers in the Marion force and in police departments of surrounding towns (Tipton, Hartford, Tipton Country Sheriff's office, State Police) had witnessed either single lights or groups of lights, both stationary and moving, which struck witnesses as unusual enough to report. Calls to several of the other departments in the area did not add much information, as the witnesses were on patrol or were not on duty at the time. In every case I was assured that the witnesses would be available if a complete investigation were carried out; in most cases the sightings were logged, or else the force is small enough that the individuals involved will be easy to find.

I did succeed in locating one witness who saw an orange light low in the northwest sky, apparently "200 - 500 feet high, three to six miles away", having driven to the west end of town (Hartford City) after hearing over his police car radio comments about other sightings in progress. The officer, Robert Meredith, reports that the Blackford County, and another man named also saw the orange light. It seems clear that the object was Venus, just prior to setting.

The other reports may involve more definite motion, and some involve multiple objects (at least one observation through binoculars), so the Venus explanation cannot readily be extended without further information.

Having established that enough information could be obtained through the Lansing reports...


- page 6 -

The first Lansing call was to the Lansing Police Department, where I spoke with Sgt. R. Snyder. A series of calls had been received from residents of Southern Lansing for several days, starting at 3 AM on Wednesday morning, May 20. A list of names was obtained from the log of Wednesday, all from people who complained of a "word noise." This noise was described approximately as a "whirring" noise, starting low and going high, then stopping. In a subsequent call to the Ingham County Sheriff's office, I was informed that at 3AM Wednesday morning a police car had made an emergency run down Miller street, employing a sergeant new "warbling" siren, which the desk sergeant described as sounding "weird."

When I read him the list of addresses of the complainants, he identified most but not all, of them as being close to the route of the emergency run.

It was also found that an elephant was tethered all night in a shopping center nearby, part of a promotion stunt.

The reports of 3 AM Wednesday, therefore, may tentatively be connected with the known emergency run, at least those definitely concerned with noises, which I understand is true in all cases.

Reports from Thursday and Friday night, however, cannot be connected with the siren, as objects were seen. There appear to be several independent sightings of different objects.

One object, a bright blue or blue-green light, was seen descending "to the ground" (that is, going out of sight following a downward course) by two people, Mr. St. and Mr. Each was in his own car on the way home when he caught sight of the object. Both were impressed sufficiently to attempt to drive to where the object disappeared, and both seem to have thought it might be an aircraft in trouble. The men met subsequently, while was acting in his capacity of television announcer (for WILX) at a remote broadcast from restaurant in Lansing, and here they each learned that the other had seen the light. Unfortunately, it appears that they have already compared their stories, as both reported to me in phone calls Saturday morning that


- page 7 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

the sighting took place at 12:10 to 12:15m. Both men have agreed to cooperate
in any detailed investigation.

One of the calls associated with the night of the emergency run previously
mentioned was from a farmer in Grand Ledge, who called the Indiana State Police
department with a report that he had seen a flying saucer land and take off again.
A police car 5 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the
farmer, whose name was not obtained, said that the object was gone; the investigation
patrol reported sighting nothing unusual, so the sighting was not logged; the name (shining
of the farmer may be difficult to discover. The farmer said the object was blue/end
15 feet in diameter. The police officer clearly believe the man to be "mistaken".

There are several more reports which need to be straightened out better than
I could do over the telephone. One involves two men coming home from the night shift
(apparently) at Oldsmobile, an [redacted] and a "[redacted]". The two men were
in a car parked in front of [redacted] house when/heard a weird noise ( apparently not
the siren - time is wrong) and saw an object that looked like a shooting star
going behind the house. It made ( or something made) a sufficiently impressive noise
that [redacted] wife jumped out of bed, terrified, the sound having awakened her.

Between phone calls to [redacted] and [redacted] on Saturday morning, I received
an unsolicited call from a reporter, Dick Frazier of the Lansing State-Journal, who
was trying to find out if my calls of the night before were legitimate, and who had
another report which came in just after I had ceased operations Friday night. A Mrs.
[redacted] Rd., Lansing, saw three objects as 9:00, 9:45, and
11:00 PM on the 20th, at least one of which showed shape ( outline, not point source)
and which was observed through binoculars. Mrs. [redacted] husband also saw the objects
and they called some neighbors who also were witnesses. One object was described
as roughly circular with many little white lights on its underside. Mrs. [redacted] did
not report until she heard of other reports, for fear she would be c alled crazy.
Frazier says she is willing to talk to scientists from Northwestern ( Frazier informed
her of our investigations). Mrs. [redacted]'s address is described as being "near

Here is the text from the document:

[Redacted], a street which appears on the list of complainants ( not in chronological order) from Wednesday night, and which should be checked as possibly involving a report from the "noise" reports.

Saturday afternoon the final call before making this report was received from Sgt Casto/of the Michigan State Police, in response to my request for any additional information that might arise. He reported that a Mrs. [Redacted] Street, Lansing, heard on the night of the 20th a very strange "whirring" sound from her back yard, at 9:00 or 9:15 PM. She saw nothing, but found a burned area in her yard, about 10 feet by 4 or 5 feet in dimensions. Leaves lying on the ground were charred, but the grass underneath was not. She has saved samples of the leaves, and is willing to be interviewed. She, too, delayed her report for fear of ridicule, until other reports were publicized. Her husband saw what she saw, heard the noise.

This brief report actually represents only a small portion of the reports that were received and logged at the police departments in the area. All police agencies appear quite willing to cooperate, and individuals seem to show a healthy mixture of interest and skepticism. My impression is that a more detailed reading of the logs together with examination of records of emergency-car movements will eliminate the bulk of reports concerned with noises only, but that other events appear to have occurred which require more detailed investigation and probably will call for several different explanations.

There follows a list of some of the persons who made reports; this is a very abbreviated list, and is given only for the purpose of aiding identification of the proper log pages or proper individuals with whom to communicate.

announcer at television
station WLIX, Jackson, Michigan, and proprietor of
Lansing, were both driving home at 0010 to 0015, Friday,
22 May. Each saw a brilliant blue light to the northeast, travelling straight down
at constant speed and brightness. Each said that the object landed 3-4 miles away,
and each thought of an airplane in distress. Both immediately began driving
toward the place where the object had seemed to come down. The object was
essentially a point-source, left no trail, and was in sight about ten seconds
maximum.

described the object as having landed in woods, and
described it as having landed to the northeast. At the time the two men were about
three miles apart on a line bearing about 100°. When their lines of sight
are drawn on a map of Lansing, they are parallel within the limits of estimate,
and cannot be made to converge closer than about ten miles away, without making
either of the observers change his description of the direction substantially.

It is concluded that this sighting was of a fireball of unusual color, with
a slight possibility that a blue light was seen descending to the ground, but at
a much greater distance than either witness estimated. The fact that the object
remained bright until it reached the horizon indicates the possibility that it
was seen along a path bearing approximately 030° from Lansing.

The fact that the brightness remained constant may be taken as evidence that
the object was remaining at approximately a constant distance (and hence, actually
travelling straight down) or that the object was moving rapidly away and becoming
brighter fast enough to overcome increasing atmospheric absorption and inverse-
square law dimming. Since the object was described as "brilliant" from the very
start, "the brightest thing I've ever seen," it must have become quite spectacular
to observers along its path as its brightness increased enough to give the impression
of constancy to the two original observers - the chances, therefore, of its having
been observed farther northwest, assuming it was a fireball, should be excellent.
Lack of such observations may be given some weight as evidence against the
meteor hypothesis, if none are reported.

4. 0010-0015 EST, 22 May 1964. Observers, three miles apart,
saw brilliant blue light, constant intensity, moving straight down, apparently
landed a few miles away. Both saw to northeast. Possible meteor, with exception
of constant intensity maintained over entire flight path. Lansing -East Lansing.

EXTRACT FROM SGT MOODY'S TRIP REPORT

The sound occurred after she had heard a siren going down the street. The sound lasted less than 5 minutes. She had the impression that it disappeared by going up rather than away. The sound gradually faded out. Her husband was asleep and did not hear the noise. When he awoke at 2030 pm, she informed him of this event. She seemed certain that the sound came from up in the air and described it as like a top wound up. She also "felt" like someone was watching her. She could feel the sound more than hear it. Information regarding the sample of leaves revealed that at 1715 on the following day as she took out rubbish to the incinerator she noticed charred leaves in the garage doorway. A roof extends above this location. An alley permitting only one car passes this door. No foliage surrounding the area was charred. No ashes or any indications of a fire or burned area were near the charred leaves. Trees and foliage completely cover the area. It is therefore assumed that the charred leaves dropped or carried to this spot by wind from a source not near the garage. It is possible that the noise heard by Mrs and other witnesses in the area during this period. The leaf sample contains no radioactive or unusual substance.

SIGHTING OF

From the residence Sgt Moody proceeded to contact Mr at his restaurant, the and rejoined Mr and his wife. They observed a meteor. The duration of two seconds and a description that the object looked like an aircraft in flames crashing are in accord with this analysis. Mr had also observed the object at the same time. A check of a local map and the direction that both reported the object indicates that their line of sight was parallel to the NE, indicating that the meteor was a considerable distance away.

Whining Object in Sky Mystifies Lansing
LANSING - An "unidentified Flying Object" extremely serious Lansing early Thursday, stirring nerves on edge and prompting police to compare the high-pitched, white to an elephant's trumpeting.

The blush, circular object was described as "a great, huge bowl, sort of spinning" and a "light-colored, shiny, silver metal thing."

Witnesses began phoning reports to Lansing police and radio and television stations shortly after the first sighting at 12:10 a.m.

Many of the sightings were in an area near the Logan Shopping Center at Jolly and Logan, on Lansing's southwest side.

A 16-year-old elephant named Tulsa is on display at the shopping center, and police told the first callers that the sound they heard might be Tulsa trumpeting.

They changed their minds as calls poured in.

Don Weigandt, 30, a television newscaster in Jackson, first saw the object while driving to his East Lansing home along College Road.

"It was very blue, too blue to be a falling star," he said. "It was round, like a basketball, and was falling very fast. But I went to the spot where it disappeared, then was nothing."

Stanley Brauer, 46, and his wife, Blanche, were on their way home from the Lansing restaurant he owns. They first saw the object along Pennsylvania Ave.

"Its speed was terrific," Brauer said. "We tried to follow it but it was going so fast that it was gone, poof! just like that. It looked like it fell in Scott's Woods (to the east)."

Mrs. Edward Cole, 50, of Lansing, said, "It looked like a great, huge bowl. It kept moving away, turning in loops as it disappeared. It was a terrible, very shrill sound that lasted about five minutes."

Elmer Speer, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I know it sounds crazy (but) I'd swear the thing landed south of my place."

"The revolutions sort of slackened off, like a motor that has been turned off. It revved up again for a second, then quit."

Speer said, the sound was a "whirring noise that started low and got so loud and high-pitched it scared me."

Army Capt. Donald Knudson, a graduate student at Michigan State University, said, "I thought it was like a helicopter (or) trucks on Cedar St. But at last, too long for that."

One unidentified woman said she saw the UFO land, then take off again.

The first Lansing call was to the Lansing Police Department, where I spoke with Sgt. R. Snyder. A series of calls had been received from residents of Southern Lansing for several days, starting at 3 AM on Wednesday, May 20. A list of names was obtained from the log of Wednesday, all from people who complained of a "weird noise." This noise was described approximately as a "whirring" noise, starting low and going high, then stopping. In a subsequent call to the Ingham County Sheriff's office, I was informed that at 3AM Wednesday morning a police car had made an emergency run down Miller street, employing a sergeant new "warbling" siren, which the desk/sergeant described as sounding "weird."

When I read him the list of addresses of the complainants, he identified most, but not all, of them as being close to the route of the emergency run. It was also found that an elephant was tethered all night in a shopping center nearby, part of a promotion stunt.

The reports of 3 AM Wednesday, therefore, may tentatively be connected with the known emergency run, at least those definitely concerned with noises, which I understand is true in all cases.

Reports from Thursday and Friday night, however, cannot be connected with the siren, as objects were seen. There appear to be several independent sightings of different objects.

One object, a bright blue or blue-green light, was seen descending "to the ground" (that is, going out of sight following a downward course) by two people, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. Each was in his own car on the way home when he caught sight of the object. Both were impressed sufficiently to attempt to drive to where the object disappeared, and both seem to have thought it might be an aircraft in trouble. The men met subsequently, while [redacted] was acting in his capacity of television announcer (for WJLX) at a remote broadcast from restaurant [redacted] in Lansing, and here they each learned that the other had seen the light. Unfortunately, it appears that they have already compared their stories, as both reported to me in phone calls Saturday morning that

the sighting took place at 12:10 to 12:15. Both men have agreed to cooperate
in any detailed investigation.

One of the calls associated with the night of the emergency run previously
mentioned was from a farmer in Grand Ledge, who called the Indiana State Police
department with a report that he had seen a flying saucer land and take off again.

A police car 5 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the
farmer, whose name was not obtained, said that the object was gone; the investigating
patrol reported sighting nothing unusual, so the sighting was not logged; the name
of the farmer may be difficult to discover. The farmer said the object was blue/end

/15 feet in diameter. The police officer clearly believes the man to be "mistaken".

There are several more reports which need to be straightened out better then
I could do over the telephone. One involves two men coming home from the night shift
(apparently) at Oldsmobile, and a. The two men were
in a car parked in front of house when/heard a weird noise (apparently not
the siren - time is wrong) and saw an object that looked like a shooting star
going behind the house. It made (or something made) a sufficiently impressive noise
that wife jumped out of bed, terrified, the sound having awakened her.

Between phone calls to and on Saturday morning, I received
an unsolicited cell from a reporter, Dick Frazier of the Lansing State-Journal, who
was trying to find out if my calls of the night before were legitimate, and who had
another report which came in just after I had ceased operations Friday night. A Mrs.
, Lansing, saw three objects as 9:00, 9:45, and
11:00 PM on the 20th, at least one of which showed shape (outline, not point source)
and which was observed through binoculars. Mrs. husband also saw the objects
and they/called some neighbors who also were witnesses. One object was described
as roughly circular with many little white lights on its underside. Mrs. did
not report until she heard of other reports, for fear she would be called crazy.

Frazier says she is willing to talk to scientists from Northwestern (Frazier informed
her of our investigations). Mrs. address is described as being "near

[street], a street which appears on the list of complainants (not in chronological order) from Wednesday night, and which should be checked as possibly involving a report from the "noise" reports.

Saturday afternoon the final call before making this report was received from Sgt Castojof the Michigan State Police, in response to my request for any additional information that might arise. He reported that a Mrs [name redacted] Street, Lansing, had just reported that she had heard on the night of the 20th a very strange "whirring" sound from her back yard, at 9:00 or 9:15 PM. She saw nothing, but found a burned area in her yard, about 10 feet by 4 or 5 feet in dimensions. Leaves lying on the ground were charred, but the grass underneath was not. She has saved samples of the leaves, and is willing to be interviewed. She, too, delayed her report for fear of ridicule, until other reports were publicized. Her husband saw what she saw, heard the noise.

This brief report actually represents only a small portion of the reports that were received and logged at the police departments in the area. All police agencies appear quite willing to cooperate, and individuals seem to show a healthy mixture of interest and skepticism. My impression is that a more detailed reading of the logs together with examination of records of emergency-car movements will eliminate the bulk of reports concerned with noises only, but that other events appear to have occurred which require more detailed investigation and probably will call for several different explanations.

There follows a list of some of the persons who made reports; this is a very abbreviated list, and is given only for the purpose of adding identification of the proper log pages or proper individuals with whom to communicate.

The first Lansing call was to the Lansing Police Department, where I spoke with Sgt. Rife/Snyder. A series of calls had been received from residents of Southern Lansing for several days, starting at 3 AM on Wednesday morning, May 20. A list of names was obtained from the log of Wednesday, all from people who complained of a "weird noise." This noise was described approximately as a "whirring" noise, starting low and going high, then stopping. In a subsequent call to the Ingham County Sheriff's office, I was informed that at 3AM Wednesday morning a police car had made an emergency run down Miller street, employing a sergeant new "warbling" siren, which the desk/sergeant described as sounding "weird."

When I read him the list of addresses of the complainants, he identified most, but not all, of them as being close to the route of the emergency run. It was also found that an elephant was tethered all night in a shopping center nearby, part of a promotion stunt.

The reports of 3 AM Wednesday, therefore, may tentatively be connected with the known emergency run, at least those definitely concerned with noises, which I understand is true in all cases.

Reports from Thursday and Friday night, however, cannot be connected with the siren, as objects were seen. There appear to be several independent sightings of different objects.

One object, a bright blue or blue-green light, was seen descending "to the ground" (that is, going out of sight following a downward course) by two people, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. Each was in his own car on the way home when he caught sight of the object. Both were impressed sufficiently to attempt to drive to where the object disappeared, and both seem to have thought it might be an aircraft in trouble. The men met subsequently, while Weigandt was acting in his capacity of television announcer (for WJIX) at a remote broadcast from restaurant [redacted] in Lansing, and here they each learned that the other had seen the light. Unfortunately, it appears that they have already compared their stories, as both reported to me in phone calls later that morning that

One of the calls associated with the night of the emergency run previously

department with a report that he had seen a flying saucer land and take off again.

A police car 5 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the
farmer, whose name was not obtained, said that the object was gone; the investigating

REPORT ON UFO ACTIVITY, MAY-JUNE, 1964

W. T. Powers, Systems Engineer
Dearborn Observatory, Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois
(Summary on Page 19)

On June 13-14, 1964, this correspondent and T. Sgt. David Moody, USAF, visited Lansing, Michigan to investigate various reports of UFO activity and apparently related phenomena which were received by local and state police during the period starting on the night of 20 May 1964 and ending 13 June, the last night of the investigation.

1. The Siren. At 0300 EST, 21 May 1964, the Lansing police department began to receive a series of calls concerning a strange noise. Those who called in described the noise as "weird" and "loud," and insisted that it was like nothing they had ever heard before. The names are listed in the police log - owing to the explanation which was found, and the existence of these names in the correspondence files, they are omitted (more than a dozen names are recorded, and police say that after this many had called, they stopped logging further calls, of which there were many).

The Ingham County Sheriff's Police department reports that at 0300 on the date of the reports, a police car made an emergency run along Miller Road (E-W) and then north to a Lansing hospital, with its blue flasher going and operating its new "warbler" siren. This new siren employs a very loud tone which rises and falls both in pitch and intensity at a rapid rate - two to three times per second. The resulting noise is quite sufficient to account for both the number of calls and the conviction on the part of the callers that something extraordinary was occurring. One woman, a Mrs. [redacted], reported a blue object "looping" or "travelling in loops" as it went by her house accompanied the strange noise. It appears most likely that she was seeing the beam from the police-car's rotating flasher
