PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 15 Sep 60
2. LOCATION: Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico 
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. SOURCE: Military and Civilian
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 minutes
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
8. COURSE: N/A
9. COMMENTS: It was a blinking light which varied from blue-white to dully red. The object appeared to be descending and ascending rapidly. The radar indicated an unidentified object was at the reported location. It appeared to be under intelligent control and therefore the conclusion was that it was probably a satellite or unidentified aircraft.
