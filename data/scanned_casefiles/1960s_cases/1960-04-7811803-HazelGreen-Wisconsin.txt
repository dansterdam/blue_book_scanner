MAJOR FRIEND, AFDLIN-4h

1. Mr. J. W., the undersigned at 1520 hours by report a UFO. The information given is as follows:

Mr. J. W., a resident of Hazel Green, Wisconsin. The sighting occurred on 4 April 1960 at approximately 1515 hours. He was engaged in routine farming activities when he was attracted by a bright, silver-colored object in the sky. The object was moving slowly in an east to west direction. The object was about three times the size of a jet aircraft as seen from the ground. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. There were no trails, vapor or exhaust noted. The object then appeared to increase in speed and altitude and disappeared from sight. Mr. J. W. feels that all the information that Mr. [REDACTED] has about the sighting is true.

2. Mr. [REDACTED] had attempted to contact you today but apparently was unable to reach you. His intent was to tell you that a close inspection of the object of 4 April 1960 from the same area and at the same time of 1929 hours. The object was still visible and was the same size as previously reported.

3. Mr. [REDACTED] is desirous of talking with you and will probably try to contact you on Monday, 18 April 1960. He had your office extension.

NEW UFO MOVIE SUBMITTED
TO AIR FORCE
A new UFO movie, filmed in Wisconsin, has been submitted to the Air Force for analysis. The movie, showing three bright UFOs, has been viewed by NICAP member Charles Maney, Decatur, Illinois, who reported the details to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.
The movie was filmed by a Hazel Green, Wisconsin man on April 4 (not March 4 as previously stated). The man, who has remained anonymous, took the film on a sunny afternoon for 30 seconds.
The successful color movie was taken by NICAP member Hazel Grant, Wisconsin, according to NICAP. The UFOs are visible for about 20 seconds in the film.
The NICAP spokesman told the paper that the sighting will be covered in a later issue.

The image contains a photograph or image, but there is no description of it provided in the text. The text appears to be an analysis of a UFO sighting report from Hazel Green, Wisconsin, dated April 11, 1960. The report includes details about the sighting, such as the date, time, location, direction of motion, and analysis of the observed object. However, the text does not mention or describe any photograph that may be present in the document.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Analysis and Conclusions: A sighting occurred in the vicinity of Dubuque, Iowa a few days prior to this incident, and it received quite a lot of publicity. All this publicity could have prompted this report. For this particular case, although it was reported that some characteristics of the object were similar to those seen in Dubuque, the overall duration of the sighting which was considerably shorter, would seem to indicate that this was probably a misidentification of some conventional aircraft.

Analysis Unit:
The reporting individual, a 17 year old student, stated that her brother first saw the object. The object was described as round, somewhat larger than an automobile, and silver in color. It was hovering over the witness' home for approximately 3-4 minutes and then it left at a high rate of speed. If this is the correct report, it is being returned as the originals. There is no information on what may have caused this incident. The report received. There is, at present, no further information available.
