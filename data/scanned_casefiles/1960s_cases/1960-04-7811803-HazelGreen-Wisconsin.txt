On April 11 at Hazel Green, Wisconsin 8 bright UFOs were photographed for 20 seconds on 8 m.m. color film by Sommerville/Kirby Jo Curran.

NEW UFO MOVIE SUBMITTED TO AIR FORCE

A new color movie taken April 11 by a Wisconsin woman has been turned over to the Air Force for analysis. The movie, showing three bright UFOs, has been viewed by NICAP member Charles Morris, Dubuque, Iowa, who reported sighting three elliptical UFOs March 4 (also March UFO Investigator).

Morris, who had unsuccessfully exposed several foil or movie film during his own sighting, is investigating the new case on behalf of NICAP. The UFOs are visible on about 20 seconds of 8 mm film.

The successful color movie was taken by Mrs. Jo Curran, Hazel Green, Wisconsin, and her family all saw the UFOs. The film was first viewed by the staff of the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald, which had reported Morris' sighting and film to the Pentagon.

(The AF later told the paper that Morris had seen real UFOs—not any known aircraft or civilian aircraft.) The AF is now studying the film and will draw its conclusions on the Curran film, and more details will be covered in a later issue.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Hazel Green, Wisconsin

Date: 11 April 1960        Hour (Z): 2350Z

WX: Clear, via 25 mi. Temp. Dr. unstable 3000'-6000', winds westerly @ 22-20 knots

Description: Three brilliant elongated discs, color of bright lights, in a formation of objects was first abreast, then triangle then trail. Was first seen 27 deg elev, moved to NW hovering and moving slow. Objects slowly faded. Viewed for 4-5 minutes.

Direction of Motion: West

Satellite: (AFOIN-483, Phone 69219)        Ruled out

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.)        Ruled out

Radar Analysis (AFOIN-421)        None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.)        --------

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.        Prob aircraft

Other:        --------

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Prob unreliable as a source of info.

Analysis and Conclusions: A sighting occurred in the vicinity of Dubuque, Iowa a few days prior to this sighting, and it received quite a lot of publicity. All the publicity could possibly, at least partly, for this particular event. Although it was reported that the objects were photographed, the film was never received at ATIC. The claim was made that the objects moved up on the wing, not being able to see the film, this claim is considered invaluable.

Analysis Bont;

The reporting individual, a 17 year old girl, said her brother first saw the objects, then she saw look some 5 or 6 minutes of them. The size was reported as half of large transports, which would suggest that they were fairly close to he witnesses. If this was the case, they may should have been seen by other individuals, which apparently wasn't the case. They were no other corroborating information, but it is possible they saw these most at a rich altitude for reflecting the sunlight, their size and tail observed by this relation. This, with a little corroboration, could very well support the report received. Therefore, this report is evaluated as probably, coupled with speculation.
