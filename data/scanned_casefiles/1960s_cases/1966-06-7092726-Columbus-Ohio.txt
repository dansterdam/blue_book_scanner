11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
A bright silvery-colored object during the night of June 66. during the sighting a high pitched humming sound was heard. The object did not disappear while being watched. The object was big enough to hold three or four men.
The lack of a definite date prevents a comprehensive evaluation of the submitted data. The case is being carried as insufficient data for a firm evaluation.
