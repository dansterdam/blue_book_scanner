Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

investigative statement: was approximately 193O Houts. 19 August, has been able to obtain any information or copies of reports on the apparent sighting of a very bright and unusual aerial phenomenon which apparently occurred across much of the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area on the night of 7 August 1965. The details of the incident are sketchy, but it appears that a large number of local residents reported seeing a very bright, luminous object or objects in the sky over the Houston area during the evening hours of 7 August. Many of the reports described the object(s) as extremely bright, maneuverable, and exhibiting a variety of colors. Some observers reportedly saw the object(s) break up into smaller fragments or pieces before disappearing from view. The Air Force and other authorities apparently received a large number of telephone calls and other inquiries from the public regarding the incident, but no official report or investigation appears to have been conducted. This office has been unable to locate any documentation on the matter, and it is not clear if any physical evidence (such as photographs) was ever obtained. The lack of a formal investigative report is unfortunate, as this appears to have been a significant aerial sighting over a metropolitan area. Without more details, it is difficult to assess the nature and origins of the phenomenon. This office would appreciate any information you may be able to provide on this incident or on similar aerial sightings in the Houston area during this time period.

Texas Notebook
Splendor Out of the Night's Sky
Louise Hoffmann is still on special assignment to investigate a Urifo mystery" at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.
BY ARMAN FRANYOLI
ON H. Thomton, Jre 12 Thornton, were returning home from Dallas on March 29, 1963, when they observed a strange object in the northwest sky. They watched it for about 20 minutes as it moved rapidly in various directions.  At times it appeared to hover in place, and at others it darted from side to side. Although they noted no flashing lights, the object seemed to be luminous and its size appeared to be about that of a star. When the object disappeared below the horizon it seemed to be several miles distant.
Rare Sight
His wife, who was in the front seat, was awakened by a bright glow in the car. She looked up and saw the object. We frequently see shooting stars, she said, but this was much larger and brighter. The object was traveling at a very high speed,  apparently something unusual was occurring up there in the night sky. Some say this may have been a comet. As the object passed through space it seemed to shed glowing particles or debris, but possibly part of a shattered planet. During certain eras huge meteorite showers have occurred with considerable debris, some of which survived and struck the earth.
Meteorites Found in Fields
Meteorites have been found lying on the surface where they fell. A number of fragments, some of which weigh as much as 25 pounds, have been picked up near Houston. According to authorities, large numbers of these celestial visitors may be scattered around in our fields and forests, yet to be discovered.
When given to such organizations as the Houston Museum of Natural Science, these fragments are carefully studied to determine their nature and origin. They contain clues about the early history of the solar system and may provide glimpses of what goes on beyond our atmosphere.

What's going on?
If a man says a spaceman came out of the sky, that's hard to believe. But there probably are strange phenomena still to be explained. We may eventually encounter intelligent life in space, but for now who knows? What is going on up there? Perhaps some of the answers can be found in the study of UFOs, comets, meteorites, and other uriusual celestial events.

"According to this witness, on the described date and time, he observed and reported an unidentified flying object which appeared at a low altitude and moved with a rapid and erratic motion with no visible means of propulsion. He estimated its size to be about 20 feet in diameter. No details of its construction or occupants were observed. It was reported to have made no sound and to have disappeared from sight after about 15 to 20 minutes."

Transcribed text:

About 8 p.m. 7-8-65 a bright object was observed traveling across the southern sky and going to the northwest. It was very bright and this object was sighted for several minutes. This was a bright full moon night. All other stars and planets were clearly visible. The object would disappear and reappear at intervals during the sighting. The object was observed by several people in the area and was traveling very rapidly at an estimated speed of several hundred miles per hour. The object then went out of sight to the northwest.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING
16 September 1965

The following additional information was secured from Mr. over the phone on the night of 13 September 1965, regarding his sighting of a round, indefinite object in the southern part of Houston.

Mr. and I observed a round, resiling object between 7:10 and 7:15 p.m. on the night of 13 September 1965, about 1000' high and traveling slow (estimated between 80 and 100 mph). The object was traveling in a southerly direction. It did not hover and there was no noise associated with its flight.

I added more information to the incident because it was of interest to me and I am sure that it was not an aircraft from the airport because I was used to seeing them. There was no description of the object, because the light was so bright that it almost hurt my eyes to look at it. There were no lights on the object that I could distinguish. The object appeared at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. The object disappeared shortly after the sun went off an aircraft. Soon after losing sight of this object, another aircraft passed over the house in that vicinity. No one else, to my wife's and myself's knowledge, observed this object other than us.

INVESTIGATION:
The statement contained in paragraph "Other Information" on the UFO Information Sheet indicates that the sighting was made by an uninvited guest or visitors at the witness' house. A check with the Houston International Airport tower revealed no information on their records indicating such a sighting, nor did they have any information on an object in the vicinity as described. A check with the Southern Air Defense Command also revealed negative results. No further investigation of this incident appears warranted.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING
0900, 16 Sep 1965
Talked with Mrs. -, by phone on this date. She stated that when she was going outside the house to hang the wash she looked up in the sky and saw a large bright object, stationary, emitting a reddish-orange glow in diameter, approximately 70-80 feet in diameter, over her house. It blended in with the sky. She could not tell exactly how high it was but stated that it seemed to be at an altitude to helicopter that was up there. She stated it was disc-shaped and associated with the object and it was definitely not any type of aircraft which she has ever seen. She stated she watched this object for some time and it took off in what seemed to her like a jumping motion, traveling at a very fast speed. There was a possibility of windows where the two circles converged. And that there was something sticking out under the object, which looked like an antenna. There were times when there were some clouds in the sky. The object appeared to go straight up for a short while and then disappeared. 
Mrs. - attempted to call one of her neighbors to show it to her but by the time she got the neighbor out the object had disappeared. She has no idea how long this sighting lasted this time.
Mrs. - saw a similar object 12 years ago (approximately 12 May 1953) when she was living in another house not too far from her present address.
I asked Mrs. - if she could draw a picture of the object and send it to me but she stated she was not very good at drawing pictures and could not give a detailed description of the object. And when she had tried to draw it at the time she said it did not satisfy her as to what she had observed. She stated that both she and her husband observed numerous peculiar lights in the sky over their house also during the past several years (10 years) which have puzzled them. 
INVESTIGATION:
Mrs. -'s residence is located in the extreme northwest section of Houston and is not too many homes around where she lives. A check with the local ACIC station indicates that there are no aircraft or balloon traffic in the area at the reported sighting time. Although I cannot come up with any explanation for this sighting, I do not plan to investigate any further unless directed by your office.
