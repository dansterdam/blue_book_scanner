Texas Notebook

Splendor Out of the Night's Sky

Louis Hofferbert is still on special assignment. Today's guest columnist is Armand Tremblay of the Houston Museum of Natural Science.

BY ARMAND TREMBLAY

ON JULY 27, at 2:30 a.m., Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Jones, Jr., 942 Thornton, were turning to Houston after a vacation trip. Traveling south on Interstate 45, Jones saw a spectacular sight. To his right and in the direction of Huntsville State Park he observed a fireball making down an almost vertically. As the brilliant white sphere reached a point close to the horizon it seemed to explode and the countryside was momentarily bathed in white.

Rare Sight

His wife, asleep in the front seat, was awakened by the flash of light. No sound was heard. We frequently see "shooting stars", or, to use a better term, meteors, in the sky. To see an individual meteor is average, however, is unusual and the average individual may see such a fireball once or twice during a lifetime.

Although many fireball colors are blue-white in color, others are vivid red, green or orange. Sparks frequently fly in all directions from the fireball and a long trail will persist in the sky for several minutes.

If it is relatively close you may hear a rumble similar to thunder and possibly a whistling sound. The average meteoroid is relatively small, perhaps a few inches in size. It is believed that it is debris left in orbit by a comet, as the earth whirls through space.

What's going on?

What's going on? What's with the story... several weeks ago, "Martians Wonderful" (Post Aug 15) and all the flying saucer reports? Mainly the one when a man saw a spaceman come out of a saucer in Florida that seemed to be a main radio station made so much of? Are these true or just a lot of fiction?

Houston

NAME WITHHELD

"A lot of fiction," may be overemphasizing, Mr. Mr. Jack Hector Quilici, Pub. Mr. Pace (Post Aug 29) says all these strange things aren't strange at all, and that no far they have all been explainable.

Atmospheric conditions play tricks on the human eye or on radar, hey, there it is, a flying saucer!

Quantanilla says all the reports investigated in 13 years have turned out to be natural phenomena. Satellites (there are a number of these going around up there now), meteors, tourists, fireworks, flares, chaff, satellites, birds, planes or other heavenly bodies, searchlights, jet exhausts, hoaxes, or mirages.—Editor.

Mr. [blacked out] stated that he talked with [blacked out]

else that saw or heard it in this time.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING
16 September 1965

The following additional information was secured from Mr. [redacted] over the phone on this date. Mr. [redacted] was located in the southern part of Houston, 3 miles west of the Houston International Airport.

Mr. [redacted]: "On the night of 13 September 1965, between 7:10 and 7:15 p.m., my wife and I observed a round dazzling white object coming from the direction of the airport (Houston International) about 1,000' high and traveling slow (estimated between 80' and 100 mph). The object was traveling in a southerly direction towards Galveston and changed altitude up and down about 100' in each direction. It did not hover and there was no noise associated with its flight.

It faded away at 7:15 p.m. Object appeared to be about 1/2 the size of an airliner or about 100 to 150' in diameter. It was a clear night and I am sure that it was not an aircraft from the airport because I am used to seeing them fly over the house. Also, it did not seem to take the same path that most of the planes from the airport take. I am sure that this was not a reflection because I light was so bright that I almost hurt my eyes to look at it. There were no lights on the object other than the large bright light. The sun had gone down and it was dusk and therefore I do not believe it could be the reflection of the sun off an aircraft. Soon after losing sight of this object, other aircraft passed over the house in their landing patterns to the airport. No one else, to my knowledge, saw this object other than my wife and myself."

INVESTIGATION:

1. The statement contained in paragraph "Other Information" on the UFO Information Sheet "Airliners made pass" does not refer to an airliner making a pass to the unknown object but to the aircraft passing over Mr. [redacted]'s house.

2. A check with the Supervisor (Mr. [redacted]) of the Houston International Airport tower revealed no information on their records indicating such a sighting as contained in this report, either on airport radar or visually by tower operators. Mr. [redacted] felt quite sure that such an incident happened it would have been observed in the tower because of its close proximity to the airport. Ellington's ACAW radar also reported negative radar UFO during this period. No further investigation is planned by this office unless directed by your section.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING                                0900, 16 Sep 1965

Talked with Mrs. by phone on this date. She stated that when she was going outside the house to hang the wash she looked up in the sky and saw a large round object, estimated to be fifty feet in diameter, over her house. The object was very shiny and bluish silver in color and seemed to blend in with the sky. She could not tell exactly how high it was but stated that it was very low and compared it in altitude to helicopters that occasionally passed over her house. She said there was no noise associated with the object and it was definitely not any type of aircraft which she has ever seen. I asked her to describe the shape of the object and she stated that it appeared to be two circles of the same size overlaid on each other with the possibility of windows where the two circles converge. The only other visible identifying feature was something sticking out underneath the object which looked like a TV antenna. She was not sure about the windows because she was so startled and nervous. There were no visible lights of any type. She said although the weather was clear and bright there were some clouds in the sky. The object appeared to go straight up for a while and then headed in a northly direction.

Mrs. attempted to call one of her neighbors to show it to her but by the time she got the neighbor, the object had disappeared. She has no knowledge of anyone else in the neighborhood seeing this object at this time.

Mrs. saw a similar object 12 years ago (approximately 12 May 1953) when she was living in another house not too far from her present address.

I asked Mrs. if she could draw a picture of the object and send it to me but she stated she was not very good at drawing pictures and could not do it. She reiterated that she knows an airplane when she sees it and this was definitely not an aircraft. She further stated that both she and her husband observed numerous peculiar lights in the sky over her house last night (15 Sep 1965) which had peculiar flight paths not normally associated with aircraft she has seen flying at night.

INVESTIGATION:

Mrs. residence is located in the extreme northwest section of Houston and is not immediately adjacent to any active airport. On the map this area appears to be a well developed part of Houston; however, Mrs. stated that there are not too many homes around where she lives. A check with the Houston Tower radar and the local AC&W radar failed to disclose any UFOs reported in the area at the time of this sighting. Although I cannot come up with any explanation for this sighting, I do not plan to investigate any further unless directed by your office.
