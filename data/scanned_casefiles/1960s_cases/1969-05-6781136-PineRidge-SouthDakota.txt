Here is the text from the document:

Lt. Col. 20 May

Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs;

I am writing to inform you on the C.O.I. we saw last night. I have been trying to understand what we saw, comparing it with other sightings, trying to make sense of it.

[Note: The rest of the text is partially illegible due to the image quality, so I cannot confidently transcribe the remaining text.]

The document appears to be a letter dated May 20th, addressed to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, regarding a UFO sighting.

The text on this page is partially legible. Here is the text I can make out:

miles west of Pine Ridge... 

...in the United State... 

...the public as it...

Some words and lines are too faint or blurry to read with certainty. The document appears to be a typewritten page with significant degradation or poor scanning quality.

Sightings
of
UFO'S

May 31, 69
Sighted unusual lights at
Pine Ridge, S. Dak. In
investigations of U.F.O.
Sightings like town red white
and blue.

Something of high rate
of speed, going from
north to south, not too
far from town. Believe
the illumination was about
the size of a dime at
arms length. It is about
the size of a small
car. From a distance.
