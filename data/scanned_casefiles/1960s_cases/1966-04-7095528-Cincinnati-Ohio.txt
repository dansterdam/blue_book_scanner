27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I was skeptical at first - because of all the claims to sightings in Michigan - this was shortly thereafter - and they had been well covered in the press. Naturally, I thought it was a plane at first - blinking and catching the early rays of the sun. However, the object appeared to hover, in one position for about 30 seconds - then moved very slowly at first - then at what appeared to be a great speed. (Slowed much in size very quickly.) Many things went through my mind in that minute - but especially the fact that, so I thought, the sun hadn't risen enough by that time to reflect off the object - hence the object must be its own light source.

Thank you for your time, sir. If the USAF can afford another stamp - I would appreciate hearing your explanation.

Very sincerely,

[Name is blacked out]

April 13, 1966

My dear Sir:

By nature I do not tend to be an alarmist or a radical. Still, I feel that what I observed on April 5, should be brought to your attention. Because of Easter, this is the first opportunity that I have had to write.

On Tuesday, April 5, at approximately 6:06 A.M. while on my way to offer mass, I spotted a very unusual aerial phenomenon. There, to the west, was a very bright orange object which appeared to hover 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the ground. It had the shape of a pancake, but thicker in the center with a definite bulge top-side. It stayed in this position about 25 seconds and then receded at apparently a great speed. At least its size was quickly as it went away from me. It was lost to my vision 4 or 5 seconds after seeming to climb and disappear behind a horizon of trees.

I have been studying psychology for some time at Xavier University and am well aware of mass psychology, especially since the recent business in Michigan. Also, I was skeptical because in the direction of the sighting is the idle-path for the Cincinnati airport. However, reflecting the sun as they both burn, but nothing like the church and decided that the sun's rays could never have been the cause of the strange color. The shape of the object, too, would not in any way fit a known aircraft.

Finally, since size is relative to distance, I had no way of judging either an unobscured guess of the distance would be 3 miles. A 707 at this distance would appear much smaller than this did.

Should you wish to pursue this further I will be happy to give any help I can.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object appeared to be in the shape of a pancake and seemed to hover for about 25 seconds. Then proceeded rapidly and was lost in 4-5 seconds. Sighting was over the Greater Cincinnati Airport. Object disappeared behind trees on the horizon. Object was orange in color. Sighting at dawn over an airport. Could possibly be a balloon but seems unlikely. More probably an AO reflecting sunlight.

Scrawled notes at bottom appear to read "Sent 164" with additional markings.
