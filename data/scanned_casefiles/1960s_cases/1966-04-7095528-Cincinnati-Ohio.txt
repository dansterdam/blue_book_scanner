Date you completed this questionnaire:

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was sighted at first - because of the Dime to sighting in Michigan, Paul was with me therefore there was a fairly clear view of the object, and continuing the early rays of the dawn however, the object appeared to - then move in position for about 30 minutes at first - then at many places seemed to be a point of light. Many things went through my mind - - that it was the planet, the sun rise enough to show the object go up - I have the object at home the only one I can show is a film taken of it.

If the UFP could afford another stamp - I would appreciate your explanation.

Very sincerely,

Text from the document:

ROGER BACON HIGH SCHOOL
4305 VINE STREET - CINCINNATI 17, OHIO

April 13, 1966

Dear Sir:

Still, I feel that I do not tend to agree that this was observed on April 13, as you feel. This unity that I have had to write.

On Tuesday, April 12, at approximately 6:06 on my way to school, I was approached by a student of this school, who told me that he had seen a strange object in the sky. At first I did not believe him, but quicker in the day many other students at the school were all discussing the same object. At the time away from me, it went and was gone from sight.

I have been studying proper reports for some time now, and I do believe that this is something that would fall in the category of what your department handles.
I realize that the recent business in Indiana and the whole case of the Chicago O'Hare sighting may seem to throw doubt on this, but I assure you that something of this nature did occur.

I would be very grateful if you could help me to pursue this further, if this is indeed of any importance to your department. Any help you can give me would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
