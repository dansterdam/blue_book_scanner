1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 29 Dec 67  01/0200Z
2. LOCATION: Honaker, Virginia (3 Witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 500 Caso

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 Minute

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: Too Close

8. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes
           ☐ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes
                     ☐ No

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Since the form 117 gives the date of the observation as 29 Dec 67 and since the report was not submitted until 69, it is being evaluated as Insufficient Data in accordance to present policy.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer sighted on object that is identical with an "illuminous light". "This thing has bothered me for about 5 years and still is, with talking matters and passing something through my body. This energy has heat and cool to it and gives me different feelings. It is a round disc with kind of super human brain, like a computer".

I apologize, but the text in this image appears to be handwritten in a cursive or script style that is very difficult to read with certainty. While I can see the text is present, I cannot confidently transcribe its contents without risking significant errors. The document appears to be a handwritten page with text written at an angle, and there are three hole punches visible on the right side of the page.

Here is the text from the document:

The document also contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a cylindrical object with a figure at one end, but as instructed, I will only transcribe the text.

Request for UFO Information

Dear [redacted] 49910

This replies to your letter of December 20, 1967. Yes, it is possible to fake a picture of a flying saucer as you suggested. The photo which you submitted is an excellent example of a fake flying saucer. Thank you for your letter and good luck.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Thank you very much for your kind reply about the chart I sent you. I agree that it is probably not any alien chart.

I enjoyed reading Project Blue Book very much.

I hope I am not wasting your time with this letter, because I realize you are very busy.

I wondered if it would be possible to fake a picture of an U.F.O. that would look as good as some pictures I have seen.

I made a model out of black paper and used thread to hang it. The idea worked. The photo enclosed is, in my opinion, very good and could pass for any scene.

I thank you and Project Blue Book.

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely low quality and blurry. While there is a photograph embedded in the document, the text is completely illegible. The image looks like a scanned document with a grayscale photograph in the center, but no text can be discerned with certainty.


- page 9 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph with blurry, indistinct shapes - a dark mass or object at the bottom of the image, a thin elongated shape on the left side, and a partial shape in the upper right corner. The image is very low contrast and grainy.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph with blurry, grainy shapes - a dark mass at the bottom center, a thin elongated shape on the left side, and a darker shape in the top right corner. The image quality is very poor and the details are difficult to discern.

* Observers' Notebook *
Climax Observation, On. December 28, 1967, about 3:00 a.m. Pacific standard time, Robert A. Neag, of Oakland, Calif., while preparing to photograph Comet Major when a brilliant orange fireball object appeared above his southeastern horizon. At first it had constant brightness, now speed, and left a conspicuous trail.

Mr. Neag reports: "While I was adjusting my research camera, the object entered the field, and was well into it when the second exposure began. Note the end of it, the object suddenly disappeared. The train quickly brightened and then began to fade. Changing from my 35mm lens to one of 105-mm. lens, I recorded its width, contorting shape. I noted its slow, no drift for about 15 minutes, one an hour later it had almost completely vanished."

The object first appeared more right ascension 5h 20m, declination -20°. Traveled about 3°, passed about 3° east of Canopus. Vanished in a dragged, hazy area of Coelia Major. In all, it covered about 15 minutes and was visible one minute and 25 seconds.
