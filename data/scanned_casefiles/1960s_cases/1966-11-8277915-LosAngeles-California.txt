Dear Sir:

On Nov 30th, 1966 about 9 P.M.
PST, I saw 2 moving lights over the
S.G., which I first thought were satellite
they were color and size of a lighted
match seen from 100 ft. quite bright be
neat the color of just magnitude stars.

[A hand-drawn sketch of some lights/objects is present in the middle of the document]

They formed a triangle with
double star in handle of great dipper
for approximately 20 minutes they were
stationary, I called the manager of this
hotel. While we watched late A event
quit 2 minutes later (about 2 min) late B
flickered out. Then we saw and then

Here is the text from the document:

...it and came across the Northern ship
of presumably the sighting. It moved
a circle, circle and headed towards
north. The lights did not return.
When I first saw them, they were
traveling at approximately twice the
speed of the jet (as well say seat to us
vertically). Lite B stopped not. Lite A
maneuvered into position and stopped
shortly after B had come to a stop.
They seemed satellites and definitely
not jets, nor stars I know of. The
air was clear, stars bright, no smog or
clouds. There were 19 sightings of
UFO (or something). This was in 1975.

Yours truly,

[Signature is blacked out]
