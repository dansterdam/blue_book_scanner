Re: U.F.O.

At about 7:25 pm, Thurs day,
New York Pkwy was nearing north
on Port Washington Blvd on Port
Washington. At a point about
200 ft north of the intersection of
Port Washington Blvd, Nathan Blvd
I noticed a stationary glowing object
alone. Some time on & nearly
would illuminate area with clouds
by & Nathan Blvd. The above
I noted this light at all was,
so I have said, there are many
false lines in the area - normally
there are no lights or houses
on the north side of the
Boulevard.
