I think the object was a weather balloon or some other scientific instrument. It was flying rather low and slowly, so it did not seem to be an aircraft. The weather conditions at the time were very mild, so I do not think that this would have caused any unusual atmospheric phenomena. Overall, it seemed like a fairly routine observation, though I cannot be certain of its exact nature.

CASE 1960-06-967746
BLOOMFIELD, CONNECTICUT

Narrative: On the evening of 5 June 1960 at approximately 7:05 PM, the witness, a male resident of Bloomfield, Connecticut, observed a round, silvery-white object in the sky. The witness estimated the object's apparent size to be about as large as the moon. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 270 degrees azimuth and 35 degrees elevation. The object was observed to move across the sky from southwest to northeast at a relatively slow speed, estimated to be about 35 mph. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

Location: West Stafford, Connecticut  
Date: 8 April 60  
Hour: (3) 5:00 P.M.  
WX: Clear Sky - Day
Description: Star like object of a white or silver color, approximately 3 to 5 meters in length, moving erratically in a zig-zag pattern in the sky. Object hovered motionless at times, then resumed erratic movement.
Duration of Sighting: 5-10 seconds  
Direction of Motion: west to east
Satellites: (AGCIN-69, Thor# 6.9231) - Negative
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Weather conditions precluded observations  
Radar Analysis (AGCIN-431): Negative  
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -  
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Negative  
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Unreliable  
Analysis and Conclusions: It appears that the object observed was either a satellite or missile rising and descending or a random optical effect (reflection, refraction, etc.). The erratic motion and short duration of the sighting tend to indicate that the object was not a conventional aircraft. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the object was an unidentified flying object.

Gentlemen:

At almost exactly 7:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on January 4, 1960, I saw an apparently well-defined light in the southwest. I had stepped out of the back door of my house and happened to look upward, noting that the light was cool and clear. Immediately I realized that this was not a star nor an elevation of approximately 25 to 30 degrees. It was moving slowly but gradually to a point that I would guess to be about 30 to 35 degrees in elevation. The light was yellow-orange in color, and it was this characteristic, rather than its motion, that first attracted my attention.

After watching the light for about 15 seconds, I summoned my sister to see it, and I walked to the side of the house away from the glare of a porch light so that I could see it better.

After watching the light for about 15 seconds, I then went indoors because of the cold. It was not until about 5 to 10 minutes later that I was able to see the light again. This time is was barely visible. Ten seconds later it disappeared, but did not reappear. Within a few seconds of the time it disappeared, I heard a rather loud rumbling sound that seemed to travel in about 5 seconds, very much like thunder. Coming from the general direction where I had last seen the light.

I do not discount the possibility that the rumbling I heard was a large truck on a distant highway. However, I doubt that it was thunder as there were no clouds in the sky. Whenever I see an unusual light such as aircraft running lights, the ambient noise level in this rural neighborhood was extremely low.

I do not discount the possibility that the rumble I heard was a large truck on a distant highway. However, I doubt that it was thunder as there were no clouds in the sky. The sun had set about 4:30 P.M., and no glow was visible on the western horizon at 7:00 P.M. when the light was visible. The temperature was below freezing and there was no wind. The light was certainly not any of the usual celestial bodies, nor was it anything that I could associate with known types of aircraft or other man-made objects.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

The following is a copy of my letter of January 5, 1960, which was answered by Major Lawrence J. Tacker:

At almost exactly 7:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on January 4, 1960, I was an apparently unexplainable light in the northwest. I had stopped out of the back door of my home and almost immediately it appeared - a bright light that was good and clear, almost greenish in color, at an elevation of approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be larger than a star, and my first impression was that it was a reflection in the sky, perhaps from some aircraft or satellite. There I was standing, and it remained at about the same angular elevation during its motion.

The light was yellow-orange in color, and it was this characteristic, rather than its motion, that first attracted my attention. The light was slightly brighter than a first magnitude star and although its small size was close to the limit of resolution, it did appear to have an apparent area of a star, perhaps being approximately circular in shape. A peculiarity that I observed was the changing of the light. My sister, who was watching with me, also noticed this effect. At times it would seem to diminish slightly in brightness, but for the most part it maintained a steady brilliance during the 15 minutes or so that I watched it.

After watching the light for about 15 minutes, I summoned my sister to see it, and I walked to the side of the house to get a better view. From there I could see the light quite clearly, and it remained at about the same elevation during its entire period of visibility. After it disappeared, I heard a rather low rumbling sound, lasting about 5 seconds, very much like distant thunder, although the sky was clear and there were no clouds visible.

- page 10 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

Like thunder, coming from the general direction where I had just seen the light, there was a low frequency sound which it seemed came from exactly the direction from which I came. At no other time did I hear any audible sound from this direction, though I listened intently. The low frequency sound seemed to fade after a short time, and the level in this rural neighborhood was not covered by a flat and steady roar, as might cause from an automobile going by on the highway. 

I do not discount the possibility that the rumble I heard was a large truck on a main street a thousand feet from my home. However, I doubt that it was thunder, as there were no clouds visible and no lightning was visible on the western horizon at about 7:30 PM. when the light was seen. This temperature was about 15 to 25 degrees F.. At no time did I see any other lights accompanying this single light, such as aircraft running lights.

There is some further information which I would like to add. One thing that I consider very unusual about this UFO sighting is that it happened to be in a position to see this UFO only about an hour before the UFO was seen. I decided to go into downtown Hartford, several blocks from the place where it had been kept for years, and placed it in my shirt pocket. However, after selecting the books I wanted at the library, I went to other local and suddenly recalled that I had left the books in the library. So I went back several times to let me take the books out without my card, but the librarian was not of course to let me take them, as my identification was not at hand.

So, I came home from the library, all the while and of course, it was then turned out that the incident that kept the door in the open is for you to see, then turned out, and I closed the door quickly. And the UFO has never been seen again. I appreciate it if you let me know what the final evaluation is of this UFO.
