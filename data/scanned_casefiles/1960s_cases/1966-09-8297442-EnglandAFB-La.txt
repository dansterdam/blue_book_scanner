B: DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT:
(1) OBSERVER'S AIRCRAFT (AC-47) WAS ON THE FIRING
RANGE STARTING TO MAKE A FIRING PASS AT A TARGET WHEN
OBJECT APPEARED BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND TARGET. OBJECT WAS
BELOW AIRCRAFT ESTIMATED ABOUT 100 - 150 FEET OFF THE
GROUND. TO ONE OBSERVER THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING
AT FIRST, AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE UP TO A SPEED OF ABOUT
70 - 80 KTS. THE OBJECT MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST AND
STAYED AT ABOUT THE SAME 100 - 150 FEET ALTITUDE. ONE
OBSERVER PILOT/FLIGHT EXAMINER TOLD THE PILOT NOT TO FIRE
BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING MOVING ON THE RANGE. HE
THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT AT FIRST, BUT COULD SEE NO LIGHTS
ON IT. AS THEY APPROACHED CLOSER TO THE OBJECT HE THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE AN AIRCRAFT WITH A LARGE RADOME ON TOP. THE
OBSERVERS AIRCRAFT WAS IN A LEFT TURN WHEN THE OBJECT
PASSED DIRECTLY BELOW THEIR AIRCRAFT STILL MOVING EAST TO
WEST AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF ABOUT 60 - 70 KTS. THE

6 Oct. 66

Contact was made with the Lake Charles weather bureau (318-477524). They normally launch balloons every six hours. A balloon was launched at 2315, 29 Sept., 66 75 minutes after launch the balloon was reporting winds at 40 knots from 260 degrees. The balloon reached an altitude of about 59,000 feet during this portion of the flight. They suspected the balloon burst shortly after, but do not have positive proof. They do not know if the balloon could have been the culprit. The winds were blowing from the west and the object was traveling with the wind.

11 Oct. 66

Contact was made with NCAR, Palestine, Texas (214-729-6921) concerning balloon launches on or about 30 Sept. 66. Mr. Warrent said that NCAR did not launch any balloons on the afternoon of the 29 Sept., 66 to account for the observation. There were no balloons launched from Palestine to account for the sighting.
