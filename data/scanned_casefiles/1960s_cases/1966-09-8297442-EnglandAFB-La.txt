THE OBJECT MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST AND STARYED AT ABOUT THE SAME 100 - 150 FEET ALTITUDE. ONE OBSERVER PILOT/FLIGHT EXAMINER TOLD THE PILOT NOT TO FIRE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING MOVING ON THE RANGE. HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT AT FIRST, BUT COULD SEE NO LIGHTS ON IT.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book document. The image shows typed text that appears to be a report or record of contacts made regarding balloon launches.

6 Oct. 66
Contact was made with the Lake Charles weather bureau (318-477-5214). They reported a balloon launch every six hours from 260 degrees at 40 knots from 12000 feet during this portion of the flight. The balloon reached an altitude of 52,000 feet during this portion of the flight. They suspected the balloon burst shortly after, but do not have positive proof. They do not know if the balloon was launched from the west or the object was traveling with the wind.

11 Oct. 66 
Contact was made with NCAR, Palestine, Texas (214-729-6921) concerning balloon launches on or about 30 Sept. 66. Mr. Varrent said that NCAR did not launch any balloons on the afternoon of the 29 Sept. 66 to account for the observation. There were no balloons launched from Palestine to account for the sighting.

13 Oct 66
Contact was made with the 6th Weather Group Major Strffer ex 632. Goodfellow AFB, Texas. There were no balloon launches on 29 Sept. 66 to account for the sighting. The last balloon that was launched 13 Oct. 66 was 26 Sept. 66.
