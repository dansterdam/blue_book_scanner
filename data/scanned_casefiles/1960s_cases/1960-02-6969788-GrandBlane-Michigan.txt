Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

I am in receipt of your letter dated April 13, 1960, regarding the delivery of photographs you furnished to our office.

The photographs were received by our office on April 18, 1960. These photographs were forwarded to the United States Air Force for analysis and evaluation, as the investigation of the reported unidentified flying objects falls within the jurisdiction of the Air Force.

To the suggested that you direct further inquiries to the Department of the Air Force.

Sincerely yours,

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING ODJECT  REPORT

BAPS-33 (RR3 Factory)

1. Appearance - Attached copy of letter to APO from Robert Selfridge 
Air Force Base, identifying picture as "unidentified flying object, 
stationed 20 April 1960".

2. This color slide shows a peculiar-shaped object on the picture. It has been analyzed as follows:
The object appears to be on the picture - taking the crater Plato as the outstanding feature. The object apparently is a satellite, dark in color, and the only one visible. There is nothing else unusual shown in the photographic field.

It is the opinion of photographic experts that the object is not a process plate defect but a satellite as it exhibits none of the usual characteristics of a process plate defect. When viewed with the naked eye, the object appears a distinct, identifiable point of light. Microscopic examination reveals damage to the emulsion in the area concerned.

3. The attached letter does not spell out the claims of the observer. While it identifies the object as a "flying saucer in the vicinity of the moon", there is no obvious support for this. The object was a space craft in the vicinity of the moon, but its identity as a flying saucer seems to be a presumptuous conclusion.

4. It is the observation that the blue spots on the slide are not but result from damage to the emulsion, probably during the developing process.

5. Suggests the slides be returned to the subject. Comments:

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Dear ******,

I am returning herewith the color slides you furnished through the Ohio State University to the Air Materiel Command Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The accompanying report analyzes these slides and concludes they were unidentified flying objects.

The color slides have been analyzed and the following represents conclusions of ATIC:

a. The slides are of the Mars terrain area of unknown location.
b. Only one slide contains anything unusual. Several spots are immediately obvious on the slide in question (the bluest spot) and is the most anomalous spot.
c. It is the opinion of the photographic experts that these spots are areas which were not reached by the camera during the filming process. These areas are not contaminated by some foreign substance as was first thought. The foreign substance contamination is ruled out.
Therefore it is the Air Force's opinion that the slides on this side are not from Mars but were taken of the terrain near Grand Blanc, Michigan.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2, the attached file concerning the unidentified flying object observed at Grand Blanc, Michigan is submitted.

2. Although the conclusions reached in the incident could, under the provisions of paragraph 1.a., AFR 200-2, be discontinued at this level, the circumstances surrounding this case would appear to warrant further investigative action and governmental analysis has generated.

3. The investigation of this incident has been limited to obtaining personal interviews and background data relative to the object and witnesses. Examination of the area has disclosed a similar colored stain, the origin of which remains unexplained, at a location approximately one mile distant from the original observation site.

4. In view of the complexities this organization contemplates, further analysis of the investigative data, including the color slides should be considered to determine the precise nature, if any, of the phenomenon involved.

2. The color slides submitted by the following individuals have been analyzed at this laboratory.

3. The slides are of the image obtained on the moon and contain no outstanding features.

4. Only one slide contains anything unusual. There are say seven distinct objects in question and only one or two of these appear to be identical with the remaining objects. The largest spot in question is 10 degrees across and is shaped like a bright star. 

5. It is the opinion of photographic experts that the slides are of a natural phenomenon and show no evidence of a structured or controlled object.

6. Suggest the slides be returned to Mr. Perry. The subject's attention is invited to the final paragraph of the attached letter.

The image contains a photograph of a greenish dome-shaped UFO that was reportedly photographed near the Moon by a restaurant owner in Grand Blanc, Michigan on February 13. The text indicates that the FBI disowned the UFO photograph and provided some background details on the incident.

FBI DISOWNS UFO PHOTO
Grand Blanc, Michigan, man February 13 Sighting. A UFO picture was taken in Grand Blanc, Michigan, according to the Restaurant Owner, but the FBI disclaimed the photograph as false. The Restaurant Owner had turned the picture over to the Air Force by the FBI, and the Air Force said it would not go into the case any further, as it did not investigate UFO reports. Edgar Hoover in the FBI office said he would examine the picture closely, but later his office announced that the picture was considered false and would not investigate the case any further.

1. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, by memorandum dated 9 January 1960, advised this Headquarters that the subject film, allegedly showing a UFO, was received by the FBI from the Commanding Officer of the Air Force Base, and that the film was forwarded to the White House. After examining the film and preparing his slides, the addressee notified the FBI that he was not able to identify the photographed object as an unusual aerial device. He stated that due to the limited background as appeared in the pictures, it was impossible to determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object. He further stated that due to the low quality of the photographic slides involved, it was not practical to have them analyzed on a scientific basis.

2. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, by memorandum dated 7 March 1960, furnished additional information and photographic slides received from the addressee who had secured them from the Civil Defense Director, Mr. D. District, who reported he had secured them from the Commanding Officer and citizens of the General Area in Accordance with AFR 200-2.

3. Attached for your information and any action deemed appropriate is a copy of Directive from the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning the film and photographic slides. The Directive is addressed to President, USAF, WPON, D.C., by District Director, OD District.

Mr. R. E. Niemeyer, President. U.F.O.R.C.
Dear President Niemeyer:
As I have had the only information from my area, 
the first case at Orland over to the U.F.O.R.C., I feel that I 
should give you the details of this case, as we understand 
it here, for your information.
The first case at Orland was reported to us by a Mr. 
Claude Shenefelt, a resident of Orland, who stated that on 
the morning of January 31, 1960, at approximately 6:50 a.m., 
he observed what he described as a lighted object, of 
disc-shaped or saucer-like configuration, hovering or
suspended in the sky above his home. This object was
estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was
described as being illuminated from within, the light being 
of a bright, bluish-white color. Mr. Shenefelt stated that 
the object hovered in the sky for a period of about 5 to 7 
minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of 
speed and disappeared from sight. 
This is supposed to be the first proper report.
Since I can see no picture of this object, I believe this
does answer your request for details.  
Respectfully,
[Signature]

That was the letter received concerning unidentified indications sighted on radar near Grand Blanc, Michigan, on October 6, 1952. It was investigated at the time by the Air Force. Report filed by the Air Force states that radar at the Grand Blanc, Michigan, ADC station picked up several unidentified targets at various times on October 6, 1952. Photographs were taken of some of these targets but when developed were too hazy to be of value. Witnesses at the radar station advised that the targets were on the scope for an extended period of time, maneuvered rapidly, and disappeared from the scope at high speeds. As this case has been thoroughly investigated by the Air Force, no further action is required.
