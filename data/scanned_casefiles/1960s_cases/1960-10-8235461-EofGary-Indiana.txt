A group of 10-15 white spots of light. Appeared to be size of large light bulbs as seen from approx 1/2 mile distance or side of a common railroad at arm's length. White in color, incandescent, rather than fluorescent light. No systematic formation or spacing except that lights appeared fairly close together and formed an overall elliptical shape similar to (cont.) at this speed. Possible that object was stationary or moving very slowly.

11. COMMENTS
This report was received 3 months after sighting. Witness reports sighting occurred at 1745 (CW), and the subsequent shows that witness was still up at this time. Witness reported that it was night, which is possible if days were long. Difficult to make any valid conclusions concerning the time of day the sighting occurred, due to inaccuracies as to the time of day, as valid comparison cannot be made as to the nature of the sighting. Observer in dim moving depth. Difficult to determine that object was stationary.
