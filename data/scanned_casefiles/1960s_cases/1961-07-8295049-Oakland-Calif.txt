At approximately 8:13 PM PDT, I observed a bright, silvery object overhead on a south to north course. It appeared to be flying about 200 mph at an altitude between 7-10,000 ft. As it passed overhead it did not appear to have any wings. It was "L" shaped with the short leg of the "L" pointing straight up and moving in a direction so that the short leg was on the front of the craft.

Its apparent size was approximately that of an index finger nail on an extended arm. There was no sign of any exhaust gases or moisture trails and there was no noticeable sound.

Approx. 8:15 PM my husband and I observed an unusual object flying above us. It appeared to be about the same size as the passenger planes who go over preparatory to landing at S. F. or Oakland but must have been much larger and at a proportionately higher altitude as it seemed to be of an irregular shape but too far up for me to distinguish just what shape.

The most unusual feature was its lack of noise. It traveled from south to north above us.
