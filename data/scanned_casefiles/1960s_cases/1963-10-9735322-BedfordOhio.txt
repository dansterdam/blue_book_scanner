27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten text appears to be partially illegible, but seems to read something like: "It appeared at hand... moved side to side taking the wind closed to me then move..."]

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ________
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Gentlemen,

I have sighted a U.F.O. It was sighted at 3:32 P.M. 
I was facing the north, and sighted a light in the N.W. 
I was this object then proceeded to N.E. It was in my 
estimation at least 32,000 feet above the ground. This 
in itself is not significant except that it was the shape of the below picture ( forgive art-work ) I did not 
see exactly where it originated, but I have a good idea. 
It seemed to be traveling in an arch, toward me and then 
away. The craft itself seemed to have a solid interior 
and a pulsating aqua haze about it. This haze was very 
slight. The craft was very bright. While traveling in 
this arch it passed the apex and then completely vanished. One second it was there and the next second, while I was still looking at it, it disappeared. This entire process took about 20 seconds.

Sincerely,

[A hand-drawn sketch of an elongated oval/rectangular object is included at the bottom of the page]
