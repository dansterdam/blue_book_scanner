My UFO was most unique in its manner of flying. I was unable to distinguish or see any details of the object itself because I missed taking a few questions to aid explain myself distinctly. Here as nearly as I can describe:

All I saw was a bright light. It was low-on-the horizon and very near. The object appeared to be spinning constantly. It moved in a straight line and changing course without banking - as an airplane would do. It hovered in one spot and then placed at another direction and hovered in another. The finally came where it took off quickly and then down several the sky. That's the part that makes me puzzled. I'll all a pipe dream. But I saw it. I will point I was nearly positive would done that. But while this puzzles me is why I wasn't able to write on windows or whatever. I got so irritating bright spinning light. I guess that I didn't go out on the yard to see if it was somewhere in the sky. But I'm afraid of the dark and would never alone at 2 or 3 AM unless a few were around. Unfortunately I felt like not working my husband to tell him. I will give area and side during him the next morning was bad enough. I'll doubt believe a more

I'm on several pages - THE RIVER NEWS-HERALD (no vista, complete)

I heard or found all around windows are warm. If they were any turn in anything else it didn't register. I don't remember if it was windy - but I do remember I flew over the field. Myself happened in May 1965, I was then 23 thousand miles awake. The whole thing lasted 2 and 3 minutes but the UFO may have been turning around some like disks in the sky. Any kind of (turn) Yes always I was not going out to see. Because I was) completely illuminated by the entire of the that bright object. It also occurred because I felt perfectly safe in my know and I figure it must do of course some time that it was almost closed the matter could probably work just happened to look up at that time.

BACKGROUND:
On 22 May 1965 I received a UFO message taken from the Lawrence Sunday E
dated 16 May 1965 describing a UFO sighting by Lawrence teenagers. I then
Ruth Watkins, one of the witnesses, and arranged an interview with all the
witnesses at Ruth's home obtaining her parent's consent.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
The witnesses were leaving the Rt. #495 drive-in theater, with Ruth, who
driving, spotted an elongated glowing object in the sky. As they left the
drive-in and emitted onto Rt. #495, the object appeared to be following them.
the Highway. Ruth observed the car ahead, parked near the curb in a
better look at the object. They tried flashing down a passing car directing
their attention to the object. The car did not stop. They then drove to
the object would alternately pull ahead and drop back in relation to the car
they drove. Upon arriving at Ruth's home they told her father what they
had witnessed. They remained at Ruth's home and discussed the incident. He
was interested in UFOs as they drove immediately to his home and related the
sighting to him. He advised them to go to the local police. They did not
see flashing lights or hear any sound. They did not see any origin or land-
ing for several minutes. A shell of similar was noted in the sky and seemed
to change colors. They could not determine the shape. They stated that
they heard a sound like a "howling, hissing" but the area was very quiet and
the sound was very low. They could not determine the direction of the sound
a field on Rt. Vernon Hill. It was located near some trees and bushes and
flashing in sky.

The object looked like a luminous flattened football. The apparent size compared to a ruler at arm's length varied between 1/4 to 1/2" and was positioned 10° above the horizon. Its apparent angular width about 500-600 yards at the ground. Its speed was now calculated as 1,000 mph. The automobile several times was travelling between 70-80 mph. At no time did the object pass directly overhead, moving rather than the clouds. It passed behind some hills along Rt. #195 which were confirmed to be 1,850 yards to the east. No estimate was given regarding the object's real size and distance from the observers.

EVALUATION:

The witnesses were sincere and excited about their sighting. I feel certain that they saw what they reported and that they were not making a hoax. I visited Father Gyr and he confirmed the youths' visits to him and discussed the incident. The residence of the Mt. Vernon area told him that since hearing about the sighting, other dogs were barking, alerting the dog. I visited the local sheriff and checked out their reported "landing evidence". The whole field had been carefully gone over. The area around the landing site was so thoroughly searched that no other unusual features in the area could be found. I heavily dug a heavy object landed could have been broken by a variety of other means. The barking dogs could have been attributed with the dog's strange or even the teenagers themselves roaming the fields and ball park at that time. The small grains and easily have been exaggerated due to the excitement and imagination of the teenagers.

I phoned the U.S. Weather Bureau for accurate weather information for the date of the sighting. There was heavy cloud cover varying between 4300-5000 feet during the sighting time. Duration of the sightings was about 10-15 minutes as they ran to get other witnesses but they sighted it again at Lawrence they ran to get other witnesses but when they returned with other witnesses the object was out of the cloud cover thus its altitude was probably a little over 5000 feet.

The next air days old, was over the western horizon at this time period that they saw was not the same sighting (although the clouds involved the operation were much the same). I am enclosing a copy of the statement which was picked up by the Akron Beacon Journal and a clipping of the advertising company involved in this affair.

solution. Since this sighting another sighting of a "saucer-shaped" object was made over the Lynn area on June 7th. Among the witnesses were a Lynn local newspaper. It was reported on radio stations WBZ and WHDH in Boston. I received several calls on the next morning from a Lynn local newspaper. Manager of the advertising plane company. Letter I found out that a member of our organization had been in contact with that same night and for an exciting few minutes thought he was witnessing a UFO until he saw aircraft landing lights.

I have written up this report primarily to illustrate how easily the misidentification of a common tri-pacer cub aircraft under unusual conditions can get off not only a UFO sighting in the air but a landing(?), escape grasp and pivotal geographical location. It is possible that reports such as these to provide out and hold ground analysis by competent and radio stations that have reported them to be notified regarding their true nature. If we are to provide needed data for future analysis by those who are anxious to do so within NICAP, the USAF PROJECT, etc. reports such as these must not be accepted at face value but be thoroughly as possible.

MAY 16 1965

See Saucer, 
Smell Sulfa

It was a cloudy night, but
four Lawrence teenagers
leaving a dance were sure
they saw something strange
Directly overhead in the sky
a flying saucer, or more corr
by, an Unidentified Flying
Object (U.F.O.).

The four students, David H.
Rich of 2 Hough road, Don
Daigle of 485 Sylvester street,
Ruth Wadkins of 16 Bour-
nett and Nancy Daigle of
Sylvester street, say they
their U.F.O. last Friday
between 9 and 10 p. m.

Ruth, the driver, was the
to see the object. From the
Nancy aligned from the

The object was much big
proportionately, than any
plane they had ever seen.
They stated driving home, Da
igle stated that the vehicle be-
gan "following them."

When they returned home
and were unable to spot
thing again. They visited
Guy J. Cyr, S.M., of Sac
kett parish, the city's ack-
nowledged U.F.O. expert, and
his advice.

Fr. Cyr, who will lecture
next week at U.F.O.s to
Salem, N. H. Lions club
to join the youngest, re-
commended that they go to
Mt. Vernon ballfield for ano-
ther sighting. At the same time,
(by telephone) one of his trial
witnesses, 13-year-old Ke
Bola of 20 Brookfield street,
told him he saw the object at
the ballfield. Kevin climbed
of bed and proceeded to the

Kevin and the other four
youngsters not only sighted the
U.F.O. again, but they also heard
some strange noises which
sounded like crickets. And, ac-
cording to them, there are no
crickets around at this time of
year. They also could smell
sulfa, which they were also
unable to account for.

The next day (Saturday, May
8), the quintet visited Temple
Emanuel cemetery across the
city and in the ballpark and
found a large, round circle. The
grass on the outside of the cir-
cle was scorched and bushes in-
side the circle had been pushed
down. They are sure that this
circle represented some sort of
space vehicle.

The ballpark-cemetery area
is a location where U.F.O.'s have
been seen before.

Many residents have seen be-
hind the same object earlier Fri-
day night. He was with Daniel
DeRuyckere of 40 Kenneth
street, when they observed the
"white object" for a period of
two minutes. Kevin described the
U.F.O. as about an inch long
and an inch level. The boys
were sure of what they saw of
the sighting. The time was about
7:15 p. m.

Fr. Cyr told the Sunday Sun
later that when the four young-
sters originally came to him,
they were visibly "scared."
When he called Kevin, two
younger sisters, Sharon and
Debra, overhead the conversa-
tion and decided to go out
and investigate for themselves.
They reported back to Fr. Cyr
that they could smell burnt
rubber or sulfa and had a hard
time breathing. Their descrip-
tion of the object was similar
to that of the other youngsters.
The girls were more like a
"hovering helicopter."

Many residents of the area
also called Fr. Cyr and reported
that a neighborhood dogs were
barking furiously. The dogs were
also heard by Fr. Cyr, and this
could have been caused by a
cricket or helicopter sound, the
sulfa smell and the difficulty in
breathing are, according to the
Sacred Heart priest, all common
and documented reports when-
ever U.F.O.'s are seen.

14 May 1965
Lawrence, Mass.

SAUCER LANDING IN MASSACHUSETTS (?) We place a question mark after this heading, because, in view of other recent landings that have turned out to be (in all probability) hoaxes, we are worried about this one. According to the newspaper account, four teenagers leaving a drive-in theater in Lawrence, Mass. on the night of May 14th, saw a large UFO in the sky. For extra data to do, they drove to Emery home of New England's most active saucer researcher, Rev. Guy J. Cyr - who by coincidence was scheduled to give a UFO slide lecture the days later. Father Cyr could not go with them, according to the papers, but he recommended that they go to the Mt. Vernon ballfield. For another sighting. These the youngsters did indeed see the UFO again, and in addition, they heard weird noises and smelled sulphur. The next day they returned to the ballfield, and found a "round circle". Needs we tell you that the grass on the outside of the circle was scorched, and bushes inside the circle had been pushed down. - Yes, it was a busy week for Father Cyr!

PLACE:

DATE:

14 May 1965

TIME:

Observed 3 times at 6 second
intervals between 3:30-5:00
PM Eastern Daylight Time

SIGHTING BACKGROUND:
On 22 May 1965 I received a newsclip concerning a UFO sighting via
The New England Newsclip Agency. It was taken from the Waverly Canteen
and dated 13 May 1965. I immediately phoned Richard Miller who was one
of the witnesses and with his parents' consent arranged an interview at
the Miller residence at 7:30 PM that same evening.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
Richard Miller and Phillip Boynton were playing golf together at the
Bradford Country Club on 14 May 1965 between 3:30 and 5:00 PM.
During this time under several they sighted a flying object 3 times for an
extended period. The object was circular and appeared to be about 4th
was hovering. It would remain motionless for about 6 seconds and then
move 6-8 a great much faster than a jet. The witnesses had never
observed anything so fast. That seemed incredible to the witnesses was
what when the object would be coming directly in their area, a small
automobile without picking up speed gradually. Another remarkable thing
noted was its color. It was silver like aluminum but had a very dull
hue that did not sparkle. The object was 1/2 at all. The weather was
bright daylight with a cloudless blue sky. The object was darker than
the sky and very outfield. He was convinced an impression that there
was a dome on top. Both observers had watched an impression that there
was a dome on top. Both observers had watched an explosion that there
was a craft of a half-dollar at its farthest point. Richard
looked like its apparent size varied with each sighting. Richard
stated he would see the object at a very definite sky location each time.
The size of a half-dollar at its farthest point. Philip gave his opinion
of the object as being about the same size. They both stated the object
was about 150 feet from where they were. Mr. Miller stated he had been
watching the sky about 2 or 3 times in the past and had seen something
of the same type of a hazy formation of light. The object had passed an
airplane. There were other objects playing golf on the green but none were
enough to talk with about the object. However, on the way out
from playing golf, they told some other golfers about what they had
seen. Upon returning home they told Richard's father who had happened
to be in the house at the time. The father suggested they write
a letter explaining the sighting in a calm, detailed way.

EVALUATION:

Beth Richard and Philip appear to be serious level-headed boys. They did not seem to be the type who would play a hoax. Richard's parents were not present at the interview. They impressed no one as being good parents who were carving out a little time for their children. They gave a fine impression that they were seeking publicity. They have a fine well-kept home on a nice street. Mr. Miller stated that the boys were very excited about what they had seen and asked more questions about UFOs and NICAP.

During the interview I had the boys fill out the UFO Report forms separately so as to avoid mutual perceptions. In addition to having them fill out the basic report forms, their answers were always substantially the same and they gave me the same description of the object. They say the object are typical of other UFOs reported - color and movements of the object are perceived in the same way. The boys gave no background or interest in "Flying Saucers". I have concluded that this sighting is an authentic and verifiable report.

13 May 1965
Farmington, New Mexico

Farmington, New Mexico. Several residents including Mr. W. R. Ford, and Mr. and Mrs. Ray Oehler reported and watching a green object which appeared to be surrounded by a cloud of smoke or steam, for one hour, from 8:45 to 9:45 on the 13th of May 1964. It finally emitted a puff of smoke and disappeared. Oehler said he was positive it was not an airplane or a balloon. "At times", he said, "the whole thing moved extra fast" and its movements seemed very erratic.

Earlier, reports from Carlsbad, described a stationary light in the sky which acted like an airport beacon except that its colors changed from green to red to yellow. The Farmington object was at 45 degrees elevation—but the azimuth reading was not supplied.

They were: Mr. Frank Brakefield, her two sons, John and Terry Beck, and a friend, Mrs. F. Brakefield, and a Will Dan Brakefield, sister-in-law of Mrs. F. Brakefield, first we have a huge orange ball of light seemingly hovering over the department parking area. When the object approached, it seemed to grow larger and larger as it came closer and closer, and when it was almost overhead, it started alternating from all-white to all-orange. Shortly after it passed over the firehouse, it was seen near Newman Creek and a small lake. Later two of the men, Ted Geln saw an object rise from the same area. In heading west, again alternating from orange to white. Later, high radios (or reading) were obtained on the N.W. corner of the lake.

John Beck

John Beck, a 12 year old student at Robinson School in Akron, Ohio, was directed by the Editor to another boy, Terry, who lives in the area. Terry was interested in this subject and casually mentioned this to John. John and Terry came to me with the story. As near as can be learned from the preliminary investigation in the North Lawrence case, in probing for facts, he was not sure of what town the firehouse was in, but it was somewhere near the firehouse. He was not sure of the exact location of the road and other landmarks in relation to the firehouse. It became obvious that he was describing the place in North Lawrence, which is about 10 miles from Akron. Mrs. F. Brakefield's phone call to her husband, who was at the firehouse, John then recalled that an announcement was made over the F.A. system. Chief Henry Hodgson told the assembled persons that a UFO had been over the building. In order to determine whether this was a fact, he correctly chose North Lawrence, which was fifth on the list.

The reason for divulging a brief portion of this preliminary procedure and introduction to the facts that will follow, is to show the method used to determine whether or not a UFO was present during the North Lawrence sighting. After this interview, John's mother wrote a letter verifying the fact that they had discussed the sighting that night, and that John seemed quite excited in telling of his experience. In their preoccupation they hadn't paid much attention. When the announcement was made about the UFO, they knew that their boy had seen something.

LARGE DOUBLE-DOMED UFO PASSES OVER BOY

John had accompanied his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Beck, to N. Lawrence to play bingo. There were approximately 250 people in the large hall, and they were in the first quarter phase of the game and went out to his father's car. He was sitting on the driver's side, looking through the left side window. A full moon which was almost overhead. (The auto was facing S.) He said he had to look up at a steep angle to see the moon. It seemed to him that the moon looked like an oval in a clear sky. His attention was soon distracted by a strange looking object which was passing slowly under the moon. The object was large, double-domed, and seemed to be quite low. Of course, passing directly over the firehouse, and continued southwest. It did not change altitude or course at any time, and its speed was constant. In comparing the moving object with the moon, he said 1/16 or 1/8 the moon's size. The sighting lasted approximately 1/3 to 1/2 minute.

The object was not lighted (more brown) and had two dome-like structures, one above, and one below a middle section. This middle section had no distinguishing characteristics. The object was moving slightly above the trees (more west). When the object was first noticed, it was moving. He seems to think this was due to rotation, in fact was sure this was so. The object was rotating slowly. The markings or axis of the object. The estimated rate of rotation was about once every three seconds (clockwise direction). Again he was unable to estimate the altitude, but the object appeared to be 3-4 times the altitude of the firehouse which is one story structure. That would put the object around 100 feet high. The speed was slow, no trail of sound was noted. While he had the object observed, there was no windows. If there were any, they were not noticed. After the object had disappeared, he waited a few more minutes. Then returned to his parents still in the same position. He had seen a flying saucer had been seen over the building, or immediately after, and that the people should exercise caution on their way home. He suggested they not go home singly.

According to Mr. Klaber, the business manager, Mr. Frank Brakefield was at the firehouse at North Lawrence at about 9:30 P.M. and was told what she had seen. A Scout vehicle with personnel was dispatched to the scene where the object observed by the Brakefield party was discussed. During the course of the night trying to locate any trace of the occurrence, no additional persons in an effort to discover other observers.

Editor's Comment:
Recent contact with members of the fire department at N. Lawrence lead me to think that several other persons were out of town all the following Monday might be significant. In eight instances out of ten, a UFO sighting is accompanied by environmental, agency, or other unusual absence. They mentioned that nothing else significant had gone to the "authorities."

Upon checking out moon phases and positions for May 17th, we found that no full moon would be due until May 26th, and the moon on May 17th was in the first quarter phase. Even then, was the full moon seen by the boy? Two possibilities come quickly to mind: the date on which John experienced his sighting might be incorrect, or the moon might have been hovering overhead, and this was mistaken for the moon. But we would welcome more details related by the observers? And why would his mother verify item had she not been there? Isn't it possible that the moon then (John's mother) might have been the "object" he saw? Or was it something else later moved west passing over the terrified Mrs. F. Brakefield?

Leroy, Ohio

OHIO CHILDREN WITNESS NEAR-LANDING: An unusually interesting clipping that has just reached us tells of an incident that occurred in the early evening of May 22nd. Six children who were playing baseball in a residential neighborhood in Leroy, Ohio, saw a saucer which almost landed on a garage roof before it skimmed over the roof tops and disappeared behind a clump of trees across the street. There was a buzzing or puffing noise emitting from the object, and it appeared to have windows. A horse and dog that were nearby went into a state of panic, and neighbors reported radio and television interference at the time of the incident.

OHIO CHILDREN WITNESS NEAR-LANDING—
ING: During the early evening hours of May 22nd, six children who were playing baseball in a residential neighborhood in Leroy, Ohio, saw a saucer which almost landed on a grape roof before it skimmed over the rooftops and disappeared behind a clump of trees across the street. The UFO was described as being "the size of a compact auto." There was a buzzing or purring sound settling from it, and - strangest of all - it had windows around its circumference. There were about a foot long and a foot wide.

At the time of the incident, a horse staked in the field where the children were playing, suddenly went into a panic, and a friendly pet dog belonging to the family, Mrs. Edward McDonald, mother of three of the children, started the chase. Since this horse is near two airports, but in this case, the horse was "scared almost to death." He reared up, and started running across with his ears and a wild look in his eyes, while the dog barked savagely.

Neighbors of the McDonalds reported interference in radio and television reception at the time the disc flew overhead. One man in particular, who had always boasted that he had perfect TV reception, experienced weather conditions or passing airplanes, complained that at the time of the sighting, his set was acting up badly.

SAUCER LANDING IN AUSTRALIA: Three residents of a hotel on a lonely road 50 miles from Mackay, Australia, claim that a UFO landed about 400 yards from the hotel on the night of May 23rd. One of the men, named J. W. Tiles, is an experienced commercial pilot. He stated to the press that he and two friends saw 20 to 30 peculiar on the object, above a circular platform. The strange flying machine looked like an upturned saucer. The top part was jet black, and the bottom were three triangular legs. At the top of each leg was a brilliant globe-like light which appeared to contract and expand continuously. The spotlight was around the main body of the machine, between the black top and the strangely lighted legs.

The UFO was in view for 30 minutes or more. It made some noise, though not much. When it left, it did so at very high speed, in a northwesterly direction.

The witnesses also stated that the object left behind a burned circle 20 feet in diameter on the ground, and scorched leaves were also photographed in color by Mr. Tiles. Constable G. Self, from the local police station, confirmed having seen these markings the next day but other police and reporters arriving at the scene later, say they found no such physical evidence. The incident has been reported to the Australian Air Force.

San Carlos, Argentina

POLICE SEARCH IN VAIN FOR FLYING SAUCER IN ARGENTINA: An unusually close sighting of a UFO in San Carlos, Argentina, last May 24th, prompted an expedition of police to thoroughly search the Gochurren county in which the strange machine had been seen to land.

The sighting was made by Darwin Nilo Miranda, who was hunting in an area called Paso de las Carretas, in the Department of San Carlos. At a distance of about 2,500 yards, Miranda saw a large object which looked like "an investigator plane". After investigating in flight and giving chase, the object landed noiseless on a hill.

The incident alerted the police. The next morning, under the command of Inspector Davila Pagella, a group of several policemen and others else dispatched to reach the landing spot on horseback. A plane was also dispatched to fly over the zone. However, nothing was found, leaving the authorities to infer (rather illegibly) that the sighting had not taken place.
