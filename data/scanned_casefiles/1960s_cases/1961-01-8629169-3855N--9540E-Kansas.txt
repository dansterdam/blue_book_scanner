10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round object size of quarter at arms length. White or blue-green changing to red just prior to burn out. Resembled a large flare. Same brilliance as lighting. No trail, trail, exhaust, or sound.

First observed at 90° above horizon and passed to 250°. Last observed at 10° above horizon and azimuth 70°. Flared out and disintegrated at 35° above horizon and disappeared in NE.

11. COMMENTS
Object probably a bolide. Description given by witness contains such key expressions as "burn out" and "explode", as well as details such as color, duration and brightness which fit well the text book description of these meteors. The possibility of this object being a "re-entry" was checked and determined not to be any known satellite or carrier. It is concluded that this object was a bolide.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
■ Meteor
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation
