UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: McHENRY, N.D.
Date: 8 FEB 60     Hour (Z) 0320
WX: SCATTERED CLOUDS -- VIS. 10 MILES.
Description: LOOKED LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE - ROSE BLUE AND SHAPE NOT REPORTED. - BLUE FLAME TRAILED
OBJECT. -- NO SOUND REPORTED -- (L) SIGHT.

APPROXIMATELY: ONE MINUTE -- SEEN FROM GROUND --
Direction of Motion: DIRECTION NOT REPORTED -- TRAVERSE STRAIGHT ACROSS SKY
Satellite: (AGENA-J3, Phone 69219) CHECKED AND BASED OUT.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): DEFINITE METEOR
RATE OF MOTION RULES OUT PLANETS AND STARS.

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): N/A.

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): ----

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: DIRECT MOUNT TO COST FOR BALLOON.
POSSIBLY AIRCRAFT.

Other: ----

Evaluation of Source Reliability: UNKNOWN

Analysis and Conclusions: IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED BY THESE WITNESSES WAS EITHER A METEOR OR AN AIRCRAFT WITH THE "AFTER BURNER" IN OPERATION. THE RELATIVELY LONG DURATION OF ONE MINUTE RULES OUT THE CASE FOR A METEOR. INTERCEPTOR TYPE AIRCRAFT WITH THE AFTER BURNER IN OPERATION HAVE A LONG BLUE FLAME COMING FROM THE REAR. THE MASS OF THESE AIRCRAFT AND SPEED OF SAME.

Would take them out of sight on the witnesses in approximately one minute - it is possible that the sound of the automobile motor (and the fact that the witnesses probably into the windows closed this time of year) would present hearing the aircraft. It is concluded that the object of this sighting was probably in aircraft.
