"It is not convenient for me to get up at this early hours of the morning, but this is the first time that I have ever seen anything that I could not explain such as stars, moon, sunrise etc. That is the only reason I called your attention to this. If you could give me any information as to what, I saw, I would greatly appreciate it."
