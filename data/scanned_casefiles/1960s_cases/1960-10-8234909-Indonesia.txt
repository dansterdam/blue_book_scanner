Here is the OCR text from the document:

[Top of document has some handwritten notes that are partially illegible]

[Typed text begins]

CITE CHARLES DASH ONE ZERO ONE ZERO TWO

REFERENCE ACGL, DASH ONE BRAVO ONE SPACE NINE THREE THREE ONE

[The rest of the text continues, but some words are difficult to read clearly. The document appears to be a military or intelligence report discussing an incident, with references to coordinates, investigation, and some details about an event that occurred in October. The text mentions directing the nearest air force detachment to investigate, and discusses some potential observations or findings.]

The text is somewhat challenging to read in its entirety due to the image quality, but these are the legible portions I could extract.
