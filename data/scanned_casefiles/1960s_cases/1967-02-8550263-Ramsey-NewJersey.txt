27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document also contains two diagrams: one showing a curved line with angle measurements from 0° to 90°, and a compass rose diagram.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

I recently asked you for some information concerning Project Blue Book and 1710. The information sent to me was very interesting and very helpful. I at present am the form which was sent to me. Have you yet decided what it is? If so let me know, I am very interested in the work.

As you should know by me more I am very much interested in 1710 and I strongly believe in the existence of Flying Saucers. I am interested to the point that I want to publish my own flying magazine. I know you are surely busy in your work, and I may be asking too much of you, but I have at least ten to take time to listen. I have up to now, so far as I know, not the editor of any other magazine, but alone I want to not lose time and...

sauces sighting, 2 the side of the government 2 the side of the people.

If I find my type of sauces sighting, in a magazine, paper, etc. I will send a copy to you. Then you will send it, evaluate and send specs needed to me. I know this sounds quite a bit, almost impossible for a busy man like you.

If this is impossible for you to please let me know - if I can be of some help. I need I say more. Rather you can do this favor for me (it is just a favor) or not, I will still think very highly of you.

Thank - You

Your most sincerely,

[signature redacted]

P.S. The name of the magazine is "Drawn Unlimited". It is a small club, and if you do the favor for a no pay, some be glad to give you a great deal of recognition in the magazine.

Thank - you

MAR 2 2 1967

Dear Joseph:

This replies to your March 14 letter requesting a model of a unidentified flying object (UFO). I am afraid that I am not going to be much help. We have no models and know of none. A "UFO" is any serial phenomenon or object which is unknown or appears out of the ordinary to the observer. Thus a model might take almost any form.

I have attached some information on the subject of unidentified flying objects which I think you will find helpful in preparing your science project.

Good luck.

Dear Sir(s),

I am a boy of 13 years of age, and I'm very much interested in U.F.O.'s.

In May at Mark Twain School #3, a science fair will be held. For my science project I am working on U.F.O.'s. I have heard of your work and I was hoping that there was some information you can give me.

Also I was wondering if you had any models of U.F.O.'s. If not would you know of any place from which I can purchase a model?

Thank You

Yours truly,

Dear Mr. [redacted]

I wrote a 4th concerning a saucer sighting. I also asked a question of you which was not answered so I am writing again. I asked a long of you concerning a saucer, maybe in Oct to see at once.

My wish was that any saucer sighting collective, during, after, if I could find it would send a copy of this to you. Then you could use this and check these and send

Dear Mr.

AUG 1 8 1967

I regret the delay in answering your correspondence; however, our present heavy workload has precluded an earlier reply.

Investigation revealed that you probably saw the star Capella; however, without an exact date, we are unable to identify positively what you observed. The description you submitted is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Capella has, in the past, been responsible for numerous unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force; your interest is appreciated.

Proposed reply to [blacked out] (Sighting February 1967)

Dear Mr. [blacked out]

Reference your recent correspondence requesting the Air Force evaluation on your February 1967 observation. I regret the delay in answering your initial correspondence; however, our present heavy workload has precluded an earlier reply.

Investigation revealed that you probably observed the star Capella; however, without an exact date, we are unable to positively identify what you observed. The description you submitted is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Capella has, in the past, been responsible for numerous unidentified flying object (UFO) observations. Your case is being carried as insufficient data, since without a positive date, a definite conclusion is not possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force; your interest is appreciated.

Dear Sir,

I have the form you had sent me filled out. It was done by my sister's girlfriend Rita. She omitted one thing which I felt is very important. She claimed that every time a car passed the object is seemed to black out. She lives near the Wanaque Reservoir and near an Army Base.

I would very much like to thank you very much for sending me the useful information on your organization. It helped me very much on my project.

I would like to tell you that I made a model of a flying saucer. By the way I was wondering if you could send me another form - in case.
