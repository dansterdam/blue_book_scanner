November 11, 1964

Mr. J. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Mr. Hynek:

Your letter of November is much appreciated and the more so since it included that my report has not only confirmed the same but with all the other odd-ball sightings! It was good to me that you wanted to know more as I write as I want to do.

I have had to refer to my original notes to renew my impressions of this December 11 in order to answer your inquiry about a possible volume with landing lights. The local airport was a modern aircraft with a modern and regular visitors.

I tried to ask about helicopters and aircraft of any other kind. Directly was not answered. At first positive, then of my house. The only thing directly for it at the time seemed to have been too far removed.

The feature that made me rule out conveyance was I didn't even ask the time. I was, the apparent strange nature in brightness that I could not explain as the normal course of a light such as one usually makes a flight. The landing light from the landing light in the bright plain manner.

I think the most obvious solution, but I could not make it for a basis of a never heard of one at the time. As I recall, in my notes, no source among of reflection - too, as described in my memo I didn't know it, but in my opinion, I am sure - just for my hope you'll let me know how you finally think!

Cordially yours,

[Signature is blacked out]

Dear [redacted]

Your recent letter to Doctor J. Allen Hynek has been forwarded to the Air Force as part of the case file on your sighting of 11 December 1963 at McMinnville, Oregon.

Since you expressed a desire to know of the final evaluation and/or disposition of the sighting, we regret to say that we are unable to provide you with an evaluation. Dr. Hynek considered the possibility of a light alternate; however, the circumstances would not support this evaluation. Balloons do carry lights and are usually battery operated; however, the motion of the object was not consistent with the evaluation of a balloon. Also, the absence of an astronomical object in that particular area rules out this as a possible evaluation.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

This office has a UFO report from [redacted]

Dear Dean [redacted]

Your recent letter dated 12 Nov 64 to Doctor J Allen Hynek has been forwarded to the Air Force as part of the case file on your sighting of 11 Dec 63.

Since you expressed a desire to know of the final evaluation and/or disposition of the sighting we regret to say that we are unable to provide you with an evaluation. Doctor Hynek considered the possibility of a light aircraft, however, the circumstances would not support this evaluation. Balloons do carry lights and are usually battery operated, however, the motion of the object was not consistent with the evaluation of a balloon. Also, the absence of an astronomical object in that particular area rules out this as a possible evaluation.

Your case has been filed as one of the few cases for which the Air Force cannot find a logical explanation. The attached statistics for 1963 indicate the small residue of those sightings which are indeed puzzling to us as well as men of science, such as yourself. The attached brochure depicts a more comprehensive picture of our project to date.

Dear sirs:

This address has been given me as appropriate for the present report; please forward if so indicated.

As a college professor of math and astronomy I have been investigating mysterious objects in the sky, suggesting them to be optical illusions or familiar items not recognized by the observers. The attached notes a month ago have left me without any good theory of what I saw. Perhaps they will interest someone else.

Very truly yours,

Dean of Faculty

Observation of December 11, 1963, 7:00 am, McMinnville, Oregon

I glanced out the bathroom window on the north side of the house and saw what appeared to be a bright star, due north, just above the horizon -- below the taller trees and nearly parallel in a break among lower trees. It appeared about as bright as Jupiter. No bright star can be seen in that position from here, though Capella is visible there in summer evening from a few degrees rather north. I guessed that it might be a nova, which could be checked by looking nearly overhead in early evening, I stepped in the next room to get my spectacles, and then I came back: I thought the star might have moved slightly. While I watched it, it began to move perceptibly to the right, parallel to the horizon, just above the lower trees. It went dim, then flashed very brightly as if a window had reflected the sun. It was in reality, moving certainly faster than the familiar visible satellites, but still, dimmer and dimmer. I could barely see it when it disappeared behind a taller tree after perhaps ten or fifteen seconds of motion, and I never saw it beyond the tree. The period of apparent motionless position was perhaps 30 to 60 seconds, the period of motion 15 seconds, the length of motion 5 to 10 degrees along the horizon.

The time of sunrise this day, locally, was about 7:40. The estimated angle of the sun that day would be 7 to 3 degrees. For an object to reflect sunlight it would have to be about 30-40 miles above the earth. This, as well as the apparent speed, would rule out aircraft. So would the noting of lateral movement during the first period of time. No earth satellite could display the same combination of apparent motionlessness followed by rapid lateral movement.

If an object were 30-40 miles aloft and visible just over the horizon from here, it would have to be at least a hundred miles away. At that distance the lateral speed of 5 degrees in 15 seconds would work out at about 21,00 mph. This would rule out floating objects such as weather balloons. Contrary to the observation, light and speed combinations would also be consistent with the observation, but I don't know of any object that would offer a reasonable explanation.

If the object were self-illuminated instead of reflecting, it could have been much nearer and slower. One might think of a helicopter, but the very bright star-like quality of the stationary period is improbable.

Evergreen Helicopter Service reports no copters were out at that time from the McMinnville airport.

5 November 1964

Linfield College,
McMinnville, Oregon

Dear [redacted]:

This letter may come as a surprise to you, and indeed a belated surprise. It is actually an answer to your letter of January 6 on the "UFO Investigation Office" of the U. S. Air Force. Although the letter was transmitted to me much earlier this year, extensive travels and an inevitable displacing of correspondence has caused this delay.

For a number of years, I have acted as consultant to the Air Force on unidentified aerial sightings. The continual flow of reports (and I cross the word "report") continues to puzzle me, especially those reports such as you make. Particularly interesting to me is the nature of many of these so-called reports. That is indeed an interesting selection factor: the poorer reports and the reports of misinterpreted objects come more frequently from untrained and less critical people than the "good" reports. That is, highly trained people can generally solve the "say" cases themselves and hence do not report them.

Be that all as it may, I have been unable to come up with any solution to your sightings of December 11, 1953, at 7:00 A. M., and I wonder whether, after all this passage of time, you may have had some afterthoughts or clues to the nature of the original stimulus.

One is tempted to suggest that you saw the landing light of an aircraft, its stationary phase occasioned by its coming directly toward you, and its lateral motion along the horizon by its making a turn. However, in that case, the light should have remained appreciably constant. You no mention that it did get dimmer and dimmer. Did the witness correspond to the start of its lateral motion? Or, was there any chance that a brightly lighted weather balloon had been launched from the local airport and came toward you for a while and then caught a change of wind and proceeded laterally? One standard candle at one mile appears as bright as Polaris, and to be as bright as Jupiter all that would be required would be to have a light less than one hundred candle power.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this matter even though the incident occurred nearly a year ago. The Air Force still lists it as an unidentified sighting, but if you feel that there is no compelling reason to believe that it could not have been an aircraft landing light, or a lighted balloon, we might be able to list it as possibly belonging to that category and take it out of the vexing unidentified column. Is the McMinnville Airport to the north of you? Darby, is it to the northeast of your location? In that case, the plane might have been in its landing pattern, coming towards you directly for a bit and then turning toward the landing strip.

In any event, I do hope to hear from you at your convenience.
All of the reports we got at Wright Field were as yours was.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
