11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was rounded coming to a point at each end. Size of a silver dollar. Its color was bright orange. Object was at an estimated 5,000 ft., traveling east to northeast. Object traveled in a straight line in an up and down manner. Object appeared twice in the twenty minute period. It seemed to be traveling a circular course. The observer saw it on the northeast leg each time. Object could have possibly been satellites but are more probably aircraft. Sighting is consistent with an aircraft sighting and probably is to be separate aircraft rather than one although it is possible that one aircraft could have circled the area but if that were the case the plane should have been observed making maneuvers.
