COMMENT: No intercept was attempted. I checked with the 1st Force Patch Supervisor, Lt Luarte, at O'Hare IFP, Ill., and in accordance with the current field directions 22 for landing. Per ADCCS 3602 the O'Hare Tower could have been using airways 1B, 5 or 6 white "white discharge lights" (or position lights) on the bottom of these aircraft.

In the undersigned's evaluation of this report, in light of the above information, that there was no apparent reason for landing at O'Hare. This interview would not render the sounds heard, etc. as conclusive.
