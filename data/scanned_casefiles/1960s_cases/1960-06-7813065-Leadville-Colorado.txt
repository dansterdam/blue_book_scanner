The image appears to contain a document from Project Blue Book, which is a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects. The document is a record card that provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on June 4, 1960 in Leadville, Colorado.

The text in the document reads as follows:

1. DATE: 4 June, 1960
2. LOCATION: Leadville, Colorado
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
4. TYPE OF OBJECT: One
5. PHOTOS: None
6. DURATION: 3 Seconds
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 Seconds
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
9. COURSE: Down then Up
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Observer claimed to witness object flying very high and fast, which resembled a pale, extremely bright, almost luminous "glow" and then went into a dive and then back up. The object is described as being like the first, as the witness had dashed into the house to get a camera.
11. COMMENTS: The image at the top seems to be a photograph related to the sighting, but the text indicates that no photographs were taken. The comments indicate that the sighting was likely a reflection from a window pane and that the observer did not know the exact facing direction.

The image contains a photograph, which appears to be a color slide taken by a Canadian tourist while the United States Air Force was investigating a UFO sighting in Leadville, Colorado on June 1, 1960. The report describes the witness's observations, including the estimated elevation of the object, its speed and angular velocity, as well as the camera settings used to capture the photograph. There is no text identifying any individuals in the image.

1. The attached color slide, taken by a Canadian tourist while the United States was investigating an ATIC object which was sighted on 1 June 1960, and is reported to show an unidentified flying object which the witness also saw.

Utilizing the information and the data from the slide, the following details regarding the witness' photographic equipment, the photographic exposure, and the object observed are furnished:

a. The estimate of the elevation (45Â°) of the object as reported by the witness is far out of line. The average elevation is much lower.

b. The witness reported that the shutter speed setting for this picture was 1/500. This means the object traveled a considerable distance while the picture was taken. At a distance of 7,200,000 nautical miles per second, 1/500 of a second, the object would have traveled approximately 14,400 feet. If such an object were to be seen all, it would appear as a linear streak approximately 1400 feet per second. If such an object were to be seen at all, it would appear as a linear streak.

c. Utilizing the speeds for 10 nautical miles distance and average of the 1-3 seconds during which the witness reported the object was in view, this object would then have traveled approximately 14,000 nautical miles.

d. The slide gives indication that the camera was not pointed directly at the object as would be expected under the circumstances, but was with the horizon.

There is no photograph present in the provided image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document containing handwritten text.

The Object is in the middle or the photograph and yet the supposed trail left by the object is in two directions from point the objects location diametrically. This discrepancy raises the probability the object making the trail.

There is no evidence of an attempt by the photographer to follow the object (panning).

The witness reported that there was no sound from the object.

If the object had been moving as fast as some distant lights, the intensity and apparent closeness of the object is improbable. Meteors and general aerodynamic vehicles of US miles per second have been heard on occasion.

From the evidence available, the ATIC conclusion is that the disc-like object on the slide is probably a lenticular cloud. The picture was probably taken through a window and the streaks which have been mistaken for a trail is due to streaks on this glass.

Further examination of this sighting by ATIC would be enhanced by determining the following from the witness:
a. The direction which he was facing when the picture was taken.
b. Was the picture taken through a closed window?
c. Were there any other people witnessed?
d. Were there any other people present at the scene of the sighting?

How far does he estimate the object moved during the time he saw it (angularly and linearly).

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object. The document states that the photograph was received from the Direction Intelligence RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force) and forwarded to ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) for further transmission.

The document provides details about the photograph, including the date/time it was taken (0630-0730 hrs on 6 June 1960), the location (Leadville, Colorado), and the photographer (a Canadian visitor to the USA). It also describes the observer's observations of the object, which was seen flying very high and rapidly oscillating, before a second object appeared and climbed across the sky.

The text in the document is as follows:

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AirA/204 INT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: AFCIN-4E4g

1. The following information and attached colored photograph, received from the Direction Intelligence RCAF for further transmission to ATIC:

Time/Date : 0630-0730 hrs 6 June 1960.
Place : Leadville, Colorado.
"Place Contact" : Canadian visitor to USA. 
Photographer: Canadian visitor to USA.

The photographer is a responsible person, who was on holiday, and can be considered as reliable, hence the security classification.

The observer first saw an object flying very high and which resembled a pulse jet or rapidly oscillating rocket. This object then climbed across his view. A second object then appeared and described the same path across the sky. The first object, as mentioned before, is of the second object and is of a color slide, is of the second object as the background indicates it was obtained into his bedroom and obtained.

2. DAI are interested in any further information ATIC may have to offer. In addition, they have offered to query the observer there are further details required.

1. If we accept the report of the photographer that observed this phenomenon then the trails and double image will require detailed analysis. However, the regard his observing an object there are several which may warrant further investigation. It would appear looking through the window the many light reflections could be on the window glass and mirroring into the camera.

2. It is suggested that future UFO photographs be taken before any additional information is requested from the source. This will enable us to obtain some of the conditions under which the photo (taken through window) were made.
