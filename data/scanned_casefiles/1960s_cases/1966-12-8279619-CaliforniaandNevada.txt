PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 9 Dec 66
2. LOCATION: California & Nevada
3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military
10. CONCLUSION: Other (Artificial Cloud Release)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Various observers reported watching a large cloud-like object. The object was yellow to blue in color and looked like a cloud before growing up into an elongated trail. The object looked like two big oblong platters. Sketches by witnesses looked quite similar.
Contact with the ASA at the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada, revealed that there was a missile launch at 22:00 hours, which is consistent with the witness observations of an artificial cloud release.

MEMO for the Records

Contact was made with the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada in regards to recent unidentified flying object sightings in that area on 5 Dec 66. An interview with Mr. Allen Gerloy revealed that there was a launch at approximately 0645 on 5 Dec 66. At altitudes there were a bright bluish green cloud which should have been visible for many miles. There were several simulated re-entry vehicles which could have been visible for about 1530 minutes. The cloud should have been visible for about 5 to 10 minutes. This cloud was the only remarkable event on 5 Dec 66 which was not as obvious as the launch on 9 Dec 66. The launch on 9 Dec 66 produced a bright bluish green cloud.

Shanadix Corporation is planning another series of high altitude rocket firings beginning at sunset, Monday, December 5, at the Tonopah Test Range, Tonopah, Nevada. The series of meteorological sounding rockets will carry payloads of trimethylaluminum (TMA) which will produce bright blue-green clouds that should be visible as far as 200-300 miles away, and should linger as bright streaks through the sky for at least an hour. 

It is probable that the luminous streaks will be visible as far away as San Francisco and Albuquerque. A similar test conducted in the Hawaiian Islands was seen by a commercial airlines pilot shortly after he left San Francisco, some 4,000 miles away. During a similar test in April of this year at the Tonopah Test Range, the visible cloud moved to the San Francisco Bay area and caused some concern among residents in that area.

The purpose of the tests is to measure wind velocity and directions at altitudes from 50-100 miles high. The TMA trails will be photographed by stations located at China Lake, California; Hawthorne, Nevada; and Cedar City, Utah. Nike-Cajun rocket systems will be used to carry the TMA payloads. The present schedule calls for shots at 5:10 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, December 5-7. All schedules are dependent on weather and cloud conditions and shots may go at any time during the week.

WITH COLOR
The U.S. conducted meteorological sounding rocket firings earlier this week at the Tooele test range. They were designed to measure wind velocity and direction from 50 to 100 miles. 
Cloud trails, created by a physical called in-rocket effluents, were photographed by scientists at China Lake, Calif. Have Utah.
The firings, conducted by the U.S. corps, were scheduled earlier this week at the Tooele test range. They were designed to measure wind velocity and direction from 50 to 100 miles.
Russ Parisi, manager of the Tooele test range, said the tests are expected to be completed this week end.

Dear Larry,

This is a mimeographed version and article on UFO's handed to me by a person who claims he got it from a source in a military base on Dec 60 [?], and to verify. All the information on this article is not new to me.

At GGT 13 contacted some people who claimed UFO was hovering about 30 feet from the ground, one large - red light in the middle, circular shape with a slight haze all around it. It remained stationary for about 2 minutes and then suddenly shot upwards at a terrific speed and disappeared. This was witnessed by [illegible] 4 persons and they were excited and thrilled.

The seds of these, one the same and the other different. Both landed to take samples and observation. Tried the whole some soil but analysis revealed nothing unusual. Radiation was normal.

[About 6:30 p.m. on January 20, 1966, a couple of drivers of cars going west on Highway 395 in California near the Nevada border stopped to observe a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be oval in shape and stationary over the desert terrain for several minutes. As the light moved away to the northeast, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. According to the report, the light seemed to be about 500-600 feet above the ground and approximately 50-75 feet in diameter.

A witness in the area described the object as being silent and having a blueish-white color. The report indicates that there were two other witnesses in the area who saw the object. The report includes a sketch of the object produced by one of the witnesses.]

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the size, shape, color and any other distinguish characteristics of the object which you saw.
The object I saw was a round, bright object, larger than a football, evenly illuminated except for a small dimmer area on the edge I think may have been a porthole or opening. It appeared to have no visible means of propulsion, made no sound, and moved at a very high rate of speed.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a pair of high-altitude experimental rockets, fired northwest of Las Vegas shortly after dark yesterday, resulting in an eerie green glow over Southern Nevada startling thousands of residents. The rockets were visible for 13 minutes over the entire western United States from Southern California to Colorado. Their purpose, according to officials at the Tonopah Test Range, was to investigate high-altitude wind patterns and dispersion layers in the stratified atmosphere. The rockets, launched with two-stage Nike-Cajun propulsion systems, started appearing at an altitude of 91 miles, and the fast-moving rockets began depositing a chemical compound that formed a glowing green cloud and vapor trail in the clear sky. The chemicals continued to be ejected until the rockets reached peak altitudes of 109 and 129 miles. From Las Vegas, the green cloud from the first rocket appeared to pulsate and was circular, while the second rocket emitted a thick vapor trail as it headed straight up, then arced and sped downward. Rocket debris later fell on the Tonopah Test Range.

"Green Glob' Hovers In LV Heavens

A pair of high altitude experimental rockets, fired northwest of Las Vegas shortly after dark yesterday, resulted in an eerie green glow over Southern Nevada startling thousands of residents.

They were seen for 13 minutes over the entire western United States from Southern California to Colorado.

Their purpose, according to officials at the Tonopah Test Range, was to investigate high altitude wind patterns and dispersion layers in the stratified atmosphere.

The rockets, launched with two-stage Nike-Cajun propulsion systems, soared upward at 5:15 and 5:31 p.m.

When they approached altitude of 91 miles, the fast moving rockets began depositing a chemical compound called aluminum chaff, which formed a glowing green cloud and vapor trail in the clear sky.

The chemicals continued to be ejected until the rockets reached peak altitudes of 109 and 129 miles.

From Las Vegas, the green cloud from the first rocket appeared to pulsate and was circular, while the second rocket emitted a thick vapor trail as it headed straight up, then arced and sped downward.

Rocket debris later fell on the Tonopah Test Range."

MYSTERY IN THE SKIES
THE EERIE GREEN LIGHTS
GREEN GLOB HOVERS IN LV HEAVENS
A pair of high-altitude experimental rockets fired northwest of Las Vegas shortly after dark yesterday, resulted in an eerie green glow over Southern Nevada startling thousands of residents.
They were seen for 15 minutes over the entire western Las Vegas from Southern California to Colorado. 
Their presence, according to the Air Force, was due to chemicals in the rockets, including nitric and ammonia layers in the rarified atmosphere.
The rockets, launched with fantastic speed, poured out the strange green glow, which undulated and shimmered in the night sky.
