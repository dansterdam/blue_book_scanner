PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 9 Dec 66, 14:00Z

2. LOCATION: California & Nevada, multiple

3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: several minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: Basically stationary

8. PHOTOS: Yes [ ] No [X]

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes [ ] No [X]

10. CONCLUSION: Other(Artificial Cloud Release)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Various observers reported watching a large cloud like object in the sky. All witnesses reported that the object was green to blue in color and looked like a cone before splitting up into an elongated tail with a slight hook on the tip. One observer said that the object looked like two big oblong platters. Sketches by two of the witnesses looked quite similar.

Contact with the AEC at the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada revealed that there was a missile launch at 0546 which produced a green-blue colored cloud. The description from the witnesses is very consistent with that of a artificial cloud release.

MEMO for the Record:

Contact was made with the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada in regards to missile activity during the first week of December 1966. Conversation with Mr. Allen Corby revealed that there was a launch at approximately 0546 PST on 9 Dec 66. At altitude there was a cloud release which produced a blue-green cloud clench which could have been visible for many miles. The cloud should have been visible for about 15-20 minutes. There were several similar launches during December 1966, one particularly on 15 Dec 66 which was the most obvious of all. The launch on 9 Dec was not as obvious as the 15 Dec launch but it still produced a bright bluish green cloud.

Sandia announcement


- page 10 -

Sandia Corporation is planning another series of high altitude rocket firings beginning at sunset, Monday, December 5, at the Tonopah Test Range, Tonopah, Nevada. The series of meteorological sounding rockets will carry payloads of trimethylaluminum (TMA) which will produce bright blue-green clouds that should be visible as far as 200-300 miles away, and should linger as bright streaks through the sky for at least an hour.

It is possible that the luminous streaks will be visible as far away as San Francisco and Albuquerque. A similar test conducted in the Hawaiian Islands was seen by a commercial airlines pilot shortly after he left San Francisco, some 4,000 miles away. During a similar test in April of this year at the Tonopah Test Range, the visible cloud moved to the San Francisco Bay area and caused some concern among residents in that area.

The purpose of the tests is to measure wind velocity and directions at altitudes from 50-100 miles high. The TMA trails will be photographed by stations located at China Lake, California, Hawthorne, Nevada, and Cedar City, Utah. Nike-Cajun rocket systems will be used to carry the TMA payloads. The present schedule calls for shots at 5:10 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, December 5-7. All schedules are dependent on weather and cloud conditions and shots may go at any time during the week.

BLUE GREEN
CLOUDS
OVER DESERT

Bright blue-green clouds will not rise high above the Nevada desert next week during a number series of tests to measure wind velocity and direction at altitudes of 50 to 100 miles.

Sandia Corp., Albuquerque, N. M., will conduct the tests, now scheduled for 5:19 p.m. next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

Meteorological sounding rockets looted from the Tonopah Test Range northwest of here will carry payloads of potentially interstellar aluminum (TEMA) which will produce a cloud as much as an hour as far away as San Francisco and Albuquerque.

TEST ROCKETS
PAINT CLOUDS
WITH COLOR
TONOPAH (AP) — Scientists fired meteorological
some rockets into the sky
over Nevada Thursday to produce bright blue-green clouds
visible as far away as Salt
Lake City and Southern California.

The rockets and their clouds
are part of a series of tests
to measure wind velocity and
direction from 50 to 100 miles
above the earth.

Cloud trails, created by a
payload called tri methyl aluminum (TMA), were to be
photographed by scientists at
China Lake, Calif., Hawthorne, Nev., and Cedar City,
Utah.

The firings, conducted by
Sandia Corp., were scheduled
earlier this week at the Tonopah test range. They were
postponed because of stormy
weather.

Ray Brin, manager of the
range, said the tests are expected to be completed this
weekend.

Dear Sir,

In a magazine I saw an article on UFO's and it gave the address of Project Blue Book and I would like to write to it with all the information on my UFO you are. On December 9, 1966 at 6:09 P.M. as I looked out our sliding doors I noticed a green doggy light to the north. I looked over to the back side to get a better look. I looked like a green comet with a short tail in the sky. The sky was black with many stars visible. I drew below what I looked like below.

At 6:07 it looked like this with initial longer and wider in two curled upward.

The scale of the two are the same and at 6:10 all trace of it were gone. It was about 25 degrees above the north horizon. A more accurate measurement was about 2 inches above hit San Antonio which is 10,064 feet high and about 14 miles away from my home.


- page 19 -

Here is the text from the document:

Then on the 16th of December I was sitting outside when at 8:30 P.M. when I looked up north and saw a green whole almost 50 degrees above the north horizon. Like the one I saw on the 9th it had no definite shape or lines. It looked like this.

I was in the house and called my brother and mother and called my friend Richard who was in the plane. When it got back outside it looked like this.

The circle then all disappeared one soon while the other one change into a circle and eventually faded out to.

Sincerely yours,

Enclosed are all the facts on the weather conditions and what the Progress Bulletin newspaper

Note: There are hand-drawn sketches of circular/oval shapes in the document, which appear to represent the objects described in the text.

Green Glob'
Hovers In
LV Heavens

A pair of high altitude experimental rockets, fired northwest of Las Vegas shortly after dark yesterday, resulted in an eerie green glow over Southern Nevada startling thousands of residents.

They were seen for 15 minutes over the entire western United States from Southern California to Colorado.

Their purpose, according to civilian spokesman at the Tonopah Test Range, was to investigate high altitude wind patterns and dispersion layers in the rarefied atmosphere.

The rockets, launched with two-stage Nike-Cajun propulsion systems, soared upward at 5:10 and 5:21 p.m.

When they approached altitudes of 50 miles, the fast moving rockets began dispersing a chemical compound called trimetally aluminum which formed a glowing green cloud and vapor trail in the clear sky.

The chemicals continued to be ejected until the rockets reached peak altitudes of 100 and 120 miles.

From Las Vegas, the green cloud and first rocket appeared to pulsate and was circular, while the second rocket emitted a thick vapor trail as it headed straight up, then arced and spun downward.

Rocket debris later fell on the Tonopah Test Range.
