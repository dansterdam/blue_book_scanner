Here is the text from the document:

Mrs Hunt/man/SAFOTCC/7282/9 Sec 55

SEP 10 1965

Dear Mr [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter in which you related an observation of an aerial object which you could not identify.

Your letter did not contain enough information for us to establish an analysis of the object you observed. However, no association can be established between an object observed and an explosion occurring at a later time.

I am enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book for your information. I hope this will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFIDIO (Attn Hunh)
WASH D C 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from requesting
information on unidentified flying objects. Records indicate pre-
vious correspondence from him in 1964, however, he has not received
the 1965 release.

2. The object observed in January 1965 is too old to warrant investiga-
tion. However, the apparent path as indicated in his drawing does
not show a natural change in direction. Duration and other essential
information is missing for evaluation. No association can be established
between an object observed and an explosion occurring at a later time.

The text I can discern on this document is:

AUG 24 (partially visible postmark)

There are several black redaction/censorship marks across the document, and some very faint text at the bottom of the page that is mostly illegible. A postmark and wavy cancellation lines are visible on the document.

The document appears to be a hand-drawn diagram with a legend in the top right corner and a compass rose/directional indicator in the bottom left corner. The diagram shows a trajectory or path with various points marked, including an object sighting and disappearance.
