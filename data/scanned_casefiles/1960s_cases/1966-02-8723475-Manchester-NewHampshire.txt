The image appears to contain a letter from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The letter is addressed to a person from Manchester, New Hampshire and discusses their submitted photograph for analysis. 

The text from the document is as follows:

Manchester, New Hampshire 03103

Dear Sir:

Reference your photograph which you submitted for analysis. A preliminary analysis has been completed, however, additional information is necessary for a more complete evaluation. This would include date and time of the photograph, camera type, camera distance to the object.

The preliminary analysis indicated:
Only one image appears on the 35mm print. This image appears to be a white ball on a 5" x 7" print. Under close examination, the image appears to be the centered reflection of some object, but there is little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white ball. No details are visible in the background or of the frame. You indicate in your letter that the object appeared to be brighter than the background. You also indicate that the object was smooth and dry in appearance. This type of photographic image would not be visible if the image photographed was no brighter than an air-craft light. Other similar images we have examined do not exhibit characteristics of true photographic images. They are probably the result of camera malfunction or other object recorded.  

If you will provide us with the above information we can make a more complete analysis. We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

J. ALLEN HYNEK, Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

NEWS LETTER
The Manned Lunar Mission, By Robert R. Gilruth* and Maxime A. Faget** Introduction
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been in existence not quite four years... Since its beginning NASA has put a strong program in the development of manned space vehicles... Furthermore, the Manned Space Flight Program has been expanded very rapidly, becoming the dominant program within NASA, which is likewise growing at a rapid pace... The next major outstanding goal of our present Manned Space Flight Program is the exploration of the Moon.
* Director, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center
** Assistant Director, Research and Development, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center
The three major schemes for the lunar mission were the direct approach involving no rendezvous, rendezvous of two parts of the mission payload in earth orbit, and the use of a separate lunar landing spacecraft which will rendezvous with the return spacecraft.
The mission is originated from a parking orbit about the earth... The scheme that has been chosen for the Apollo mission was announced on July 11, 1962 as the lunar orbit rendezvous method. This scheme was first studied in detail by Dr. John C. Houbolt of NASA Langley Research Center a year and a half ago... The Manned Spacecraft Center started a serious study of this scheme almost a year ago...
The important characteristics of the lunar rendezvous approach are as follows: (1) A separate spacecraft is used for landing on the moon... (2) The total amount of propellant required is less than the amount required for the direct flight... (3) A smaller launch vehicle is required as a consequence of the weight reduction.
The Clearview Manchester Astronomical Society wishes every one a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, even though it may be by the time this sheet comes out. We have become international in members last month - U.F.O. study is one of our projects but we are wondering when the next one will come in. We did not have a believable story for six months, and when we do get one some joker was pulling our legs but this time the truth...

Dear Sir:
George P. Freeman, Jr.

Office of Information
This is in reference to your letter of August 12, 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in reference to an unidentified flying object observed in the atmosphere at an altitude of 600 ft. The camera was a 35mm press type and it was taken on the 14th of August, 1966. The film has been obtained, with some difficulty, and indeed Lucky Regnitz was the man who sold me the camera has been consulted, to no satisfaction. A negative will be sent to you and you can make all the measurements you want from it. However, when you are finished with please return it as one print due to the fact that they were supposed to make only one print from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base-they were unable to due to the quality of the film and they have not been able to obtain any satisfactory further prints. We find that we are unable to be of more assistance, but feel that we have done all that we can and don't wish to be blamed for unfulfillable promises.

P.S. I have decided to forward the original negative in this letter. And good luck on anything else.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
UFO (UFO ) 16 NOV 67
UFO OBSERVATION & PHOTOGRAPHS: 25 FEBRUARY 1965
Manchester, New Hampshire 03103

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs - In the original questionnaire you completed, you stated the objects were clearly defined, and the objects were described in your observation as being "over 100 feet wide, going northwest in question #27, and later changed direction to 600 feet."

2. The other witness states that it was a cloudy night, the objects were like bluish-white lights, and on question #27 indicates that he saw the objects going northwest.

3. Both you and the other witness state that there were two objects. The photographs show there was only one "white ball" on the print. There is little or no evidence of a hard image within the emulsion showing the actual size and shape of the object.

Most apparent images on the film are the result of careless processing or scanning, with the additional information provided, the object was calculated to have been fourteen feet across the minor axis.

There is, however, no definite outline or shape for the "object" due to insufficient clarity to enable a positive identification.

SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/bp/79079/8 Feb 67

FEB - 8 1967

Dear Mr._________:

Reference your sighting of February 2, 1966 on which a photograph was taken and classified unidentified flyingobject.

The additional information received in your letter dated August 16, 1966 has been noted. The enclosures, which you sent, have been considered, but could have been flare or an out-of-focus object, as there is no indication of the size or distance of the object. As for the letter, the camera used was a 35 mm. speed graphic with a normal lens.

As for the report, although a positive identification of the stimulus has not been made, it is unknown that the reports of Mr._________ and yourself differ in many respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object.

It is reported in the earlier photo analysis report, (reference letter of August 2, 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson) we are unable to make a positive assessment of the image without the additional information.

I am enclosing the original negative and two prints.

Sincerely,

God, that is of course the question. Been what do we have to do, what's left of it? There's no practical place for me to go now, no way to stay about it longer. The impact seems to me of continuing significance. I must comment on that further. All us find it necessary to continue here, what's left of it. How can you please believe one - don't know; still looks so real. Great lights in the field to thought many occupants of one or another explanation.

I SPOTTED UFO WINCH
People like us are FRIENDLY - some are not - COME AND VISIT.
Spent some time on ground people soaked of light.
I FELT LIKE I'D ACTUALLY BEEN TO ANOTHER WORLD -
MAYBE I WAS, MAYBE A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF SOME SORT.
Reportedly about 1 1/2 stories tall, a brilliant display! could well
go from a man's height to 30 ft in an instant. Stayed about a minute.
- We may have clearance at that time or may not have seen it.
Homes, trees, the surroundings would tell as I now realize after my 1st
close encounter of some kind - Could have been a test or for other

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order 67-84 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla requesting photo analysis be performed on an original negative submitted by the observer. The negative exhibits an image of an unidentified flying object. Enclosed with the original negative, which was not available for the preparation of the photo analysis, were photo analysis prints that have been made. Trudeau specifically to enable image measurement. The numbers of work orders previously com-puted on this project are 66-94 and 66-50.

2. ANALYSIS: Analysis was conducted jointly by the Photo Analysis Division, TDPA, and the Photo Interpretation Division, TDPF.

3. ONLY one true image appears on the negative. This image appears as a white ball on the 5" x 7" print. Under close examination, the image appears to be smooth, indicating little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white ball. There is little or no evidence of camera motion or image motion. There is little or no indication of the object's actual size, distance, or altitude. This photograph indicates the weather was clear and dry and that it was a bright night with many stars. This photograph should be credible at the image photographed was no brighter than many normal stars.

4. We are unable to make a positive identification of the image. Information necessary for a more definite analysis is lack of a claim, type of claim, lens data, focal length, exposure data, and distance from camera to object. Perhaps it should be noted that the reports of UFO sightings are sometimes, in part, the result of a subjective response concerning the appearance and movement of the object.

Proposed reply to correspondence from [redacted]

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your sighting of 2 February 1966 in which a photograph was taken of an alleged unidentified flying object.

The additional information received (letter dated 16 August 1966) has not been of value in identifying the image on the photograph. The flashbulb, which was used, would have had little or no effect on the illumination of an object a distance of 600 feet when used in conjunction with a lens aperture of f 4.5. As stated in the letter, the camera used was a 4 x 5 speed graphic with a normal lens. The camera focal length was not given.

As for the report, although a positive identification of the stimuli has not been made, it is felt that you observed an aircraft. It should be noted that the reports of Mr. [redacted] concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects contradictory.

As reported in the earlier photo analysis report, (reference letter of 2 August 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson) we are unable to make a positive measurement of the image without the additional information.

Enclosure:
1. Original Negative
2. One print
