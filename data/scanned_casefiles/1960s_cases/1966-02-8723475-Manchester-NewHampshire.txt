1. DATE: Subentry 66 27/0522

2. LOCATION: Manchester, New Hampshire (2 witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual

7. COURSE: Conflicting

8. PHOTOS: None

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Beginning: Other (CONFLICTING DATA)
    Photo Analysis: Other (INSUFFICIENT CLARITY TO ENABLE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer saw two flashing reddish-orange lights that were about the intensity of aircraft lights. The objects were seen on 26 Feb 66 at 1:32 EST in Manchester. They traveled in a straight course and after they were first seen.

Comments: The observer has seen UFO's many times. On 15 Jan 66 is supposed to have taken a ride in a space ship. For Proj 164, relating to this case the observer forgot this ride. Note: For it is not substantiated that his friend is an extraterrestrial. Reliability of the observer seems to be in question.

Dear Mr.

Reference your photograph which you submitted for analysis. A preliminary analysis has been completed, however, additional information is necessary for a more detailed analysis. This would include type of film used, type of camera, lens data, focal length, exposure data and distance from camera to the object.

The preliminary analysis indicated:

Only one true image appears on the negative. This image appears as a white ball on the 5" x 7" print. Under close examination, the image appears to be smeared indicating either camera motion or image motion. There is little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white area. No areas are visible in the background of the frame. You indicate in your statement that the object appeared no brighter than an aircraft wing light. You also indicate that the weather was clear and dry and that it was a bright night with many stars. This being the case, stars should be visible if the image photographed was no brighter than an aircraft wing light. Other apparent images on the negative do not exhibit characteristics of true photographic images. They are probably the result of careless processing or poor film handling. The second object reported could not be identified or located on the print.

If you will provide us with the above information we can make a more complete analysis. We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

HAROLD QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF

NEWS LETTER

The Manned Lunar Mission, By Robert R. Gilruth* and Maxime A. Faget**
Introduction

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been in existence not quite four years. Since its beginning NASA has had a strong program in the development of manned space vehicles. Furthermore, the Manned Space Flight Program has been expanded very rapidly, becoming the dominant program within NASA, which is likewise growing at a rapid pace. The next major outstanding goal of our present Manned Space Flight Program is the exploration of the Moon.

* Director, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center
** Assistant Director, Research and Development, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center

The three major schemes for the lunar mission were direct approach involving no rendezvous, rendezvous of two parts of the mission payload in earth orbit, and the use of a separate lunar landing spacecraft which will rendezvous with the return spacecraft in lunar orbit.

The mission is originated from a parking orbit about the earth. The vehicle is maneuvered into an orbit about the moon from which the landing is made. These maneuvers will be discussed in a subsequent section of this paper.

The scheme that has been chosen for the Apollo mission was announced July 11, 1962, as the lunar orbit rendezvous method. This scheme was first studied in detail by Dr. John C. Loubolt of NASA Langley Research Center a year and a half ago. The Manned Spacecraft Center started a serious study of this scheme almost a year ago. Every element within NASA with a major role in the Apollo program has also carried out studies of the various mission schemes, and there exists at this time a unanimous agreement among these elements that the lunar orbit rendezvous scheme is the preferred method to carry out the Apollo mission.

The important characteristics of the lunar rendezvous approach are as follows:
(1) A separate spacecraft is used for landing on the moon. (2) The total amount of mass that must be boosted to escape velocity is greatly decreased. (3) A minimum number of additional elements not already being designed and manufactured are needed to achieve the mission objectives.

The Clearview Manchester Astronomical Society wishes every one a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, even though it may be late by the time this sheet is out. We have become international in members last month. U.F.O. study is one of our pet projects but we are wondering when the next report will come. We did not have a believable story for six months, and when we do get one some joker was pulling our leg. Let's have the truth.

TDPT (UFO)Maj Quintanilla/70916/mbs/16 Nov 67
UFO Observation & Photograph, 26 February 1966

Manchester, New Hampshire 03103

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs. In the original questionnaire you completed, you stated that it was a clear night, the objects were orange-red in color, approximately one-half mile away, and indicated that the objects were going northwest in question #27. You later changed the distance to 600 feet.

2. The other witness states that it was a cloudy night, the objects were like bluish-white lights, and on question #27 indicates that he saw the objects going southwest.

3. Both you and the other witness state that there were two objects. The photo-experts report that there is only one "white ball" on the print. There is little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white area. No stars were visible despite the fact that they should have been. If the object was bright as stated, most apparent images on the film are the result of careless processing or poor film handling. With the additional information provided, the object was calculated to have been fourteen feet across the major axis and approximately twelve feet across the minor axis.

4. There is, however, no definite outline or shape for the "object" itself, precluding a definite identification. Because of this, the case is being carried as "Conflicting Data" and the photograph as "Insufficient clarity to enable a positive identification."

SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/bp/79079/8 Feb 67

FEB - 8 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference your sighting of February 2, 1966 in which a photograph was taken of an alleged unidentified object.

The additional information received in your letter dated August 16, 1966 has not been of value in identifying the image on the photograph. The flashbulb, which you state was used, would have had little or no effect on the illumination of an object at a distance of 600 feet then used in conjunction with a lens aperture of f. 4.5. As stated in the letter, the camera focal length was a 4 x 5 speed graphic with a normal lens.

As for the report, although a positive identification of the stimulus has not been made, it is felt that you observed an aircraft. It should be noted that the reports of Mr. [redacted] and yourself differ in several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object.

As reported in the earlier photo analysis report, (reference letter of August 2, 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson) we are unable to make a positive measurement of the image without the additional information.

I am enclosing the original negative and two prints.

Sincerely,

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order 67-84 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla requesting photo analysis be performed on an original negative submitted by the Quarterly Manchester Astronomical Society. The negative purportedly exhibits an image of an unidentified flying object, on which two previous photo analysis reports have been made by FTD. Enclosed with the original negative, which was not available for the preparation of the two previous photo analysis reports, is the camera focal length and image approximately 66-50, and contain non-measural analysis of the image.

2. ANALYSIS: Mensural analysis was accomplished on the original negative utilizing the altitude and focal length provided by. This resulted in the determination that the image is oval in shape and measured approximately 11 feet across the major axis and approximately 12 feet across the minor axis.

P HRS:
        One negative, one 5" x 7" print, one cropped enlargement

1. PURPOSE: This report is written for Major H. Quintanilla, TDEW/UFO, in answer to Work Order Number 66-44 requesting an analysis of the unidentified image on the referenced photographs.

2. ANALYSIS: Analysis was conducted jointly by the Photo Analysis Division, TDPA, and the Photo Processing Division, TDPP.

3. Only one true image appears on the negative. This image appears as a white ball on the 5" x 7" print. Under close examination, the image appears to be smeared indicating either camera motion or image motion. There is little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white area. No stars are visible in the background of the frame. Mr. [redacted] in his statement that the object appeared no brighter than an aircraft wing light. He also indicates the weather was clear and dry and that it was a bright night with many stars. Being the case, stars should be visible if the image photographed was no brighter than an aircraft wing light. Other apparent images on the negative do not exhibit characteristics of true photographic images. They are probably the result of careless processing or poor film handling. The second object reported could not be identified or located on the print.

4. We are unable to make a positive identification of the image. Information necessary for a more detailed analysis would include; type of camera, lens data, focal length, exposure data and distance from camera to object. Perhaps it should be noted that the reports of Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] differ in several respects concerning the appearance and movement of the object.

Dear L:

Reference your letter of 27 April 1966 requesting the status of your unidentified object report.

I am sorry for the delay in returning your negative and two prints. Presently the world is extremely heavy, therefore, it will take longer to process and develop prints of your negative and to evaluate your sighting. Upon completion of analysis we will return your original negative along with two prints and a copy of the photo analysis.

Your concern for this project is appreciated.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Proposed reply to correspondence from

Dear Mr.

Reference your sighting of 2 February 1966 in which a photograph was taken of an alleged unidentified flying object.

The additional information received (letter dated 16 August 1966) has not been of value in identifying the image on the photograph. The flashbulb, which Mr. states was used, would have had little or no effect on the illumination of an object at a distance of 600 feet when used in conjunction with a lens aperture of F 4.5. As stated in the letter the camera used was a 4 X 5 speed graphic with a normal lens. The camera focal length was not given.

As for the report, although a positive identification of the stimuli has not been made, it is felt that you observed an aircraft. It should be noted that the reports of Mr. and yourself differ in several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object.

As reported in the earlier photo analysis report, (reference letter of 2 August 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson) we are unable to make a positive measurement of the image without the additional information.
