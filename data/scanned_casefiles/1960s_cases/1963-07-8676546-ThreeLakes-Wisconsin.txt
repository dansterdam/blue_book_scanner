Dear Sir:

As I don't usually write Washington, I couldn't quite decide where to send this. It is roughly a "flying saucer", or something that looked a heck of a lot like a flying saucer. I suppose you can forward this to the Air Force, or 7083, or whatever agency is in charge of this.

To get down to brass tacks:
at the moment I am staying at my Aunt's resort, Bridgewood Cabin, which is near Three Lakes, Wisconsin. The area is mostly woodland, all it is not as

Here is the OCR text from the document:

sparsely populated as might seem.

During the summer there are
people staying in their summer
cottages nearby. Last night (Wednesday,
July 17) it was about 1 o'clock in
the morning. I was awake, looking
out the window. An object
(which I have designated 'flying
saucer') flew across the upper part
of the window, then I lost sight
of it. It flew too high to be a bird,
too low to be the moon, and it
did not in any way resemble
any planes or helicopters that I
know. It seemed to be about a

mile distant, and I don't know
how high (as I have had no
presence in measuring the kind of
distance). It seemed to be globules.
The object was moving slightly
swifter than a plane, altho I think
a plane could have caught up to
it if it was a really fast one.
It glowed. That is, it flashed.
I can't estimate the rate per minute.
(Somewhere around 80 times, I think)
I don't know whether it made any
noise or not, because it was
windy last night and I'm not
yet used to the normal woodland

noises around here.

That's all. Thanks for listening,

and I assure you that if you

care to investigate you'll find

I'm not a crackpot.

Yours Truly,

P.S. - My aunt, an elderly lady, told me

she saw something like what I saw

done 20 years ago

P.S.S.- My address in case you want it:
