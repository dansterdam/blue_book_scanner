Reference the attached letter from requesting information on her unidentified observations. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear Mr

We have checked the satellite schedule on the Soho and Pegasus satellites for the night of 4 October 1965 and find that only Pegasus I was in the area. However, this satellite was moving Southeast and not Northwest. There are more than thirty satellites now orbiting the Earth at this time. It is quite likely that one of these other satellites or space debris was observed.

As to the sighting of September 15 or 16, it is probable that the object moving Northeast was a satellite. However, the red object moving to the Northwest cannot be associated with that satellite. It is a possible that a high-flying aircraft. Without specific date and time, no check can be made of these objects.

All known satellites have orbital flights with an easterly component whether Northeast or Southeast and have visual characteristics similar to "a moving star." We are attaching a list of some of the visible satellites and a brochure which explains the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects.

The text in the image is partially illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. While I can see that it is a typewritten document, many words and lines are difficult to read clearly. The text appears to be a report or document with multiple paragraphs, but I cannot confidently transcribe the specific content without risking introducing errors.

1. The objects were too high to be planes, their lights also were steady without blinking.

2. The red object was traveling away from the white object and this looked as if it came from it.

3. Could this red object be a reentering capsule of information from one of our satellites? That there were two sightings of the same course seems to clearly justify that it is a satellite. These are my husband's observations.

We would be very interested to know if there is an official record of the satellite and the "reentering capsule". Or is there another more plausible explanation? Thank you.

Sincerely,
