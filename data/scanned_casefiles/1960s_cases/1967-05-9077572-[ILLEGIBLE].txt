35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire - a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Just not know I had photographed a UFO with the telescope and pointed the photograph to the night sky. The reason I sent it is you is because in my study of space, model society, and geography, I have never known any object - such as the manner in which I did. I estimated that UFO with or without by the line of exposure (type - size) I also eliminated - what because I had seen on my picture directly on the west point (clearly in the picture) not more very much, while this was moved at least half an inch (in the picture)

Dear Sirs:

Last Friday night (5/19/67) sometime between 6:45 pm and 7:30 pm, I saw a group of nine were looking at a hill taking time off groups of stars. While I continued looking away my photographs from a working perspective. Out of several hundred stars, one of them was moving up down, all around "while still the same moving in about the same (high) with (unclear) steps (stalled) and starting moving again. The only vehicle I know that could do that would be either a helicopter or a UFO.

The person who observed it was then 5 minutes long. I took the picture at a 70° angle. That would mean that it

UFO Photograph, May 19, 1967

Lexington, Kentucky 40502

1. Reference your photograph of an unidentified flying object which you forwarded to the Aerial Phenomena Office for analysis. Your photograph was analyzed by photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB.

2. The photograph which you submitted appears to be genuine as far as content is concerned; i.e., there is no indication of doubt except rotouching, or either the negative or the resultant paper print. The condition of the negative is poor, having many scratches, fingerprints, etc., which rendered a comprehensive analysis virtually impossible. Although no definite configuration could be discerned in the imagery, the possibility exists that it was a result of static electricity having occurred prior to processing.

3. No further analysis can be made since you did not observe an object. Your print, negative and one enlargement are enclosed. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

P NRG: One 620 negative and print

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 67-78 submitted by Major Quintanilla (IOETD) requesting an analysis of the submitted photograph and negative to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: The submitted photography appears to be genuine as far as content is concerned. There is no indication of double exposure or touching on either the negative or the resultant paper print. The condition of the negative is poor, having many scratches, finger prints etc. which rendered a comprehensively analysis virtually impossible. Although no definite configuration could be alluded to the imagery, the possibility exists that it was a static electricity having occurred prior to processing.
