k. Position title of preparing officer: Chief Base Operations and Training Division. Comments: The possible cause of this sighting is unknown. I do not believe based on characteristics of the object that marsh gas is a factor in this case. The movements of the object from one area to another and its ultimate departure do not support such a theory. The object was also viewed during night and daytime conditions.
