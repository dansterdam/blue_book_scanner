11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer originally wrote that he had "seen another flying saucer" on 31 July 68. A form 117 was sent to the observer to complete. The data given on the form is insufficient and is unable to be evaluated. At best the report appears to be a close sighting of an object which may have been a UFO on 31 July 68.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE MAJOR SOURCES OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS ON, LIGHTS IN BUILDINGS, ETC. BRIGHT MOONLIGHT. GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON. DESCRIBE ITS MOTION, DURATION, AND APPEARANCE. ITEM APPEARED AS BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ERRATICALLY IN ZIGZAG PATTERN, CHANGING DIRECTION ABRUPTLY, THEN DISAPPEARING IN STRAIGHT LINE OVER HOUSE IN DISTANCE. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT 10-12 MINUTES. ITEM APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH IN SKY AND SIZE OF SMALL COIN HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. RUN A CHECK TO SEE IF THE PHENOMENON COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ANY CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS. PHENOMENON COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ANY KNOWN OR CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION. IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS AFFECTED BY THE WEATHER CONDITIONS? NO.

GENERAL COMMENTS: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND PUZZLING CASES I HAVE ENCOUNTERED. THE ERRATIC PATH AND ABRUPT CHANGES OF DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR METEOR. WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS SIGHTING.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram depicts an unidentified flying object (UFO) with a circular shape and various annotations around it.

OCR output:

The lights looked like they were broad light and nearly the size of a saucer on the night. I could see no wings or motors or protrusion of any kind. It just appeared to be a saucer shaped craft that moved silently and rapidly. All I can say is that from what I saw it appeared to be a very unusual craft and far beyond the capability of any aircraft that I know of.

8. DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION
The observer describes seeing 7 UFOs in the sky at approximately 1000 on 3 Aug 68. The UFOs were described as circular objects with lights on the circumference and a larger light in the center. The observer watched the UFOs for about 15 minutes.

9. CONCLUSION
POSSIBLE CONVENTIONAL REPORT

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer states that he saw 7 UFOs in the sky at approximately 1000 on 3 Aug 68, which he described as circular objects with lights on the circumference and a larger light in the center. He watched the objects for about 15 minutes. In our opinion, the observer saw too many UFOs and it is our conclusion that this is a possible conventional report.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON:
THE PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED IN DAYLIGHT. IT WAS A LARGE, SOLID, BRIGHT OBJECT. IT WAS MOVING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE.

TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY, SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR OTHER SOURCES.
THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION WAS THE SUN.

REMARKS:
THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS VERY LARGE AND BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN A STAR OR PLANET. IT WAS SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE. THE OBJECT WAS SOLID AND TRANSPARENT. IT MOVED AT A VERY HIGH SPEED AND WAS VISIBLE IN DAYLIGHT. SEVERAL OBSERVERS SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER, ITS GREAT SPEED AND BRIGHTNESS WOULD SEEM TO RULE OUT THIS POSSIBILITY. THEREFORE, IT APPEARS THAT THIS WAS SOME TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

I was not very near this craft and did not get a very clear view of it. I was about 1000 yards away when I first saw it. The craft was saucer-shaped, about 50 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in color. It hovered silently in the sky for about 5 minutes, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I was able to clearly see the outline and shape of the craft, but was not close enough to make out any details of the surface or note any identifying markings. I have no explanation for what I saw, but it clearly was not an ordinary aircraft.

Transcribing the text in the document:

The sighting occurred on June 26, 1968, at approximately 11:25 p.m. near Thousand Palms, California. The witness, a resident of Thousand Palms, reported observing a bright, reddish-orange object in the sky that hovered for several minutes before moving rapidly away. The witness, who was outdoors at the time, stated that the object was approximately 300 feet in diameter and appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground. The witness also reported that the object made no sound and emitted a bright glow. The witness did not see any other aircraft in the area at the time. The report states that the witness was very frightened by the sighting and that his heart was "pounding" during the encounter. The report concludes by noting that the incident was investigated by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, but that no explanation for the sighting was found.

Dear sir or madam,

According to the information given, this appears to be a handwritten document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation files, specifically relating to an incident that occurred on July 3, 1968 in Thousand Palms, California. The text appears to be a witness statement or report describing the observed UFO event.

The text reads as follows:

"Please consider this a report of a sighting of a very bright light in the sky, which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed and then suddenly stopped and hovered in the sky for several minutes. The object then accelerated and disappeared from sight. This was observed by several individuals in the Thousand Palms area on July 3, 1968 at approximately 9:30 p.m. The object was observed for approximately 3-5 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared. I am writing this report at the request of the Air Force, who was notified of the sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional information regarding this incident. Sincerely, [Signature]"

Dear sir, or sir: I saw a ufp in the sky over cathedrAl city. the time was 10:15 pm. it appeared to be moving fast from the south east and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. the shape was circular and it made no sound at all. it had a steady bright light that seemed to be pulsating. the object was observed for about 5 minutes. again in the same place it was again observed for a second period of about 2 minutes. as i watched it, it just disappeared. I was watching it with another person, and he agreed on what we saw. This whole incident was most alarming to us, and we are at a loss to explain it. any help on this matter would be appreciated.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is:

We arrived a little after 2:00 am. At first it appeared to be a flat light in the distance, but as we approached, the light seemed to expand and take on a definite form. It was an oval object, 40-50 ft in diameter, with a dome on the top. There was a bright light on the bottom of the object which seemed to illuminate the ground beneath it. As we got closer, the light became less intense, but the object itself appeared to be metallic and reflecting starlight. It was hovering 50-75 ft above the ground, and as we drove closer, it moved off rapidly to the southwest, accelerating very fast. As it accelerated, it gave off a bright white light like a magnesium flare, and in a matter of seconds it had disappeared from sight. We followed it as far as we could, but it was gone. The night was clear, and there was no aircraft anywhere in the sky at the time. This is one of the most remarkable things I have ever seen, and I certainly have no explanation for it. I wish there had been some way to get a photograph, but it all happened so quickly that we didn't have time. I wonder if anyone else in the area may have seen the same thing?

Thousand Palms
California
FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED
About 7:00 PM on July 7, 1968, a resident of Thousand Palms, California, observed a bright, glowing object in the sky. The object was first seen in the northeast and was reported to be moving in a northerly direction.
The object was described as being as large as a jet airliner and was brightly lit up, appearing to have red and blue lights on its surface. It was observed for several minutes before disappearing from sight.
The report was received and investigated by the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.

- page 27 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document or report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the following text found in the document:

I am the witness who telephoned in the report of the unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Thousand Palms, California on the night of July 7, 1968. As I mentioned in my telephone report, I have been an aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Air Force for over six years. I am thoroughly familiar with the silhouettes and flight characteristics of practically all military and commercial aircraft in use today. The object I observed could not have been any type of known aircraft.

The incident occurred at approximately 9:30 p.m. as I was driving home from work. I was traveling south on Highway 111 about 2 miles north of Thousand Palms when I first sighted the object. At first I thought it was merely a bright star, but as I continued to observe it, the object began to change position in the sky. It appeared to be hovering at first, then suddenly it accelerated and moved rapidly in a southeast direction, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The speed with which it moved was incredible - far greater than any aircraft I have ever seen. The object appeared to be oval in shape and was giving off a bright orange glow. I estimate that it was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.

I am convinced that what I saw was not an aircraft of any kind, but rather some type of unidentified flying object. As an experienced aircraft mechanic, I can state with certainty that the performance characteristics of the object I observed were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. I hope this report will be of assistance in your investigation of this incident.

Thinking back after the incident it seems rather incredible that the object I saw could not have been something like a meteorite or some other natural phenomenon. The object appeared to be 50 to 75 feet in diameter, circular in shape and definitely not a shooting star or meteor. It appeared to be hovering over a desert area near the foothills and seemed to be illuminated from the inside out. The intensity of the light was not blinding but rather a soft glowing light. The object remained stationary for several minutes then suddenly shot off towards the east at an incredible speed, climbing at about a 45 degree angle. The speed at which it accelerated was unbelievable. I watched it for several seconds as it disappeared from sight. This was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding the nature of the object I saw.

at about 10:10 pm on 24 June 1968, he and his family members were outside their home in Thousand Palms, California, when they observed a very bright object in the sky. The object was described as circular in shape, glowing yellow-orange in color, and appeared to be at an elevation of about 30 degrees. It remained stationary for approximately 2-3 minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view. The witness stated that the object was much larger and brighter than any conventional aircraft, and that it made no sound. He estimated that the object was approximately 1 mile in diameter. The witness reported the incident to the local sheriff's office, who in turn notified the nearby Norton Air Force Base.

Dear Miss Campbell,

Thank you for your letter of March 19, 1968 concerning the UFO sighting which you reported to me on March 18, 1968. 

I have carefully reviewed the details of your report and have determined that it is worthy of further investigation. To that end, I have referred your case to our investigative team for a more in-depth analysis.

You can expect to be contacted in the near future by one of our field investigators who will want to discuss the incident with you in greater detail and possibly arrange a site visit. In the meantime, please feel free to provide any additional information or insights you may have regarding this event.

Thank you again for bringing this matter to our attention. We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to working with you on this case.

Sincerely,
Major Hector Quintana

a strange sort of operation in this particular case. There are a number of sightings reported, some of them in the Thousand Palms, California, area, between the hours of 8:00 pm and 10:30 pm on July 7, 1968. The report states that a "brilliant object" was seen moving in the sky in an erratic manner, hovering, and darting rapidly from side to side. Some observers reported that the object emitted a reddish-orange light. Other details indicate that the object appeared to be intelligently controlled, with a transparent or translucent quality. The report also mentions that two young boys saw the object land in a field and then take off again. There are no photographs or other visual evidence included with this report.

Assuming incoming report indicates 
object observed at Thousand Palms, California on 7 July 1968.

The object was observed at approximately 8:50 p.m. (Pacific Daylight Time) on 7 July 1968 over the Thousand Palms area. The witness, a retired USAF pilot with over 7,000 hours of flight time, reported that he first observed the object approaching from the southwest and that it appeared to be about 1,500 to 2,000 feet in altitude. He stated that the object was triangular or wedge-shaped, and that it was approximately 30 to 40 feet in length. The witness reported that the object was metallic in appearance and that it did not have any visible means of propulsion. He also stated that the object moved at a speed that he estimated to be approximately 300 mph. The witness further reported that the object suddenly stopped and hovered for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, and that during this time it did not make any sound. The witness then stated that the object then accelerated at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view to the northeast.

My name is Mack and I am an investigator for the U.S. Air Force project Blue Book. On 7 July 1968, I received a report of an unidentified flying object sighting near Thousand Palms, California. The witness, a local resident, claimed to have seen a bright light in the sky that maneuvered in an unusual manner before disappearing. I have included the witness's handwritten account of the incident, which has been partially redacted to protect the individual's privacy.

Dear Air Force,
Before you get my reply to your September 24 letter, I pray may tell you that I have already most of the details from another source. I am most anxious for more help.

Thank you, Blry Oryx

P.S. Don't you get the send me another form to fill up. I have read the cover page which warn that coming about one or more of these subjects are not permissible. At least one time close to my heart.

Thank you again.

Text extracted from the document:

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE CONCERNS THE SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA, SUCH AS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFOS) OR UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA. COMPLETE EACH ITEM AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN TO THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
1. WHEN DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? DAY JULY MONTH YEAR 1968
2. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOURS MINUTES 23 P.M.
3. HOW LONG DID YOU OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON? HOURS MINUTES 15
4. WHAT DID THE PHENOMENON LOOK LIKE? 
IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A TRIANGLE. ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL AND HAD A LIGHT COMING FROM THE CENTER. IT MADE NO SOUND.
5. DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED:
After a death, with 15-20 cars on the highway, I was less than a mile from the freeway. I was looking at the night sky and saw a light flashing (on and off). The light seemed to be moving and I watched it carefully as it appeared to move further away. It was a triangular shaped object that had a light in the center. I watched it for about 15 minutes as it slowly moved further away from the highway.
6. IMAGING YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. WHAT ANGLE ABOVE THE HORIZON WAS THE PHENOMENON WHEN YOU LAST SAW IT? SHOW HOW HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN.
[Hand-drawn diagram showing the elevation of the observed phenomenon]

The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass with directional labels. The smaller sketches show landscape views, one with a person standing in the foreground and mountains in the background.

TEXT:
AS NEARLY AS I CAN RECALL THIS WAS THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND THIS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE PATH AS NEARLY AS I COULD DETERMINE IT. THE EXACT POSITION AS INDICATED BY THE SKETCH IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS PRECISE AND ABSOLUTE, BUT MERELY AS APPROXIMATE AND INDICATIVE OF THE GENERAL AREA AND DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY.
