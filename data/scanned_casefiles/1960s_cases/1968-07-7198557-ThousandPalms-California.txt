A common object that when placed on the sky would look like what I saw, would be a search light, except for the red and white light. It moved from side to side, and then up and down. It made a complete circle and stopped.

21. DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE, OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, AN AREA, OR SURROUNDING OBJECTS?
Our outdoor light kind of dimmed. My dog turned and looked at me and then up to the sky with his ears perked. Straight up. My own feeling was of great interest and what way the matter could be. I was not at the close to it. It was not close to me.

These dear here are nothing to do with the above question, but I thought maybe that I could help you in your collecting of reports of sightings in my area. I am or try to be a researcher on this matter, on subject. I try to get all that I can on this matter and then some. I don't know if you know these or not but Eva Helen saw some UFO's after she was a cat caring in Hawaii. I tried to get a first hand report on what she saw, but have received no answer or reply. I guess you best me to it and told her not to say anything about it.

But I thought that I could help and send you reports of sightings from people who are afraid to report them to you, because of fear of publicity and embarrassment by their friends and the public. I hope some reports of sightings in my area that might be of help to you, and if you would like to hear them or see them or send the rest of the help you can help me in this way. I and the reports of sightings in my area will be glad to...

JUL 23 1968

Dear Mr.

This will reply to both your letters postmarked July 16, 1968, in which you describe your sightings of unidentified flying object(s) (UFO's).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of either of your sightings. However, you will complete the attached questionnaires and mail them in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each base in the United States has a UFO Investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sightings yourself by looking at the categories of objects or other reported UFO's in the Project Blue Book report we are including.

quite often began from what they told me from the description of it and the way it acted, it was round in shape, and moved up. then down, left then right, like a play sign. After this moving about it slowed up and away at fantastic speed. We were flying in pan Clemente California and were coming from the races at long beach California. We now live in Thousand Palms, California. I am 17 years old and I do believe in "flying saucers" or UFO's, as you might call them. I have a friend who hath him and his mother have talked with a UFO. from what he told me, the object would only answer "yes or no" questions. He tried to use lie detectors so he could see it better, but every time he even thought of trying them the object would disappear and then reappear a short time later.

Dear Sir on Sunday

A haze soon ago flying saucer, they came to Palm Springs flying sun. It was sighted on July 31, 1968, I left for the day. Some time to see it, the show signified around 5:15 o'clock. It was about a quarter of the picture left in a bright white light of coming straight through the sky at angles slightly through pit was the landing lights off an airplane, because about two or three planes hovered or were about to land, and I think there were taking off. One big cycled of changing cycle, the air field, and on its circles came over the circuit. The airport was about a single airport. This bright white light came

Dear Sir or Sirs,

I have spotted a UFO in the sky over Cathedral City. The time was 10:45 PM. It appeared between two stars, equally between them.

As I watched the object, it moved from right to left. It stopped for a moment, and then, then went in a complete circle and stopped again in the same place that it was originally in. I was walking my dog at the time. I saw it. Let first it looked just like another star. But as I watched on, a red fire and a white, little blinked, off and on, then it went into the maneuvers I explained above.

I watched it for about 5 or 10 minutes. Again it moved from side to side and back to its position. It stayed there, and was still there when I went on.

My parents have seen a UFO hovering over the ocean off

He also told me if they used their sign language, the thing would take off and then return later. This sign this thing very frequently and has puzzled it out to me. It has looked like a star in the sky, but it moves peculiarly. I have not asked it quietly, but he has and got his mother like I said before. It moves up and down at times on or from night to left off the answer is no. We fed not tell me the questions that his mother has asked. I couldn't tell you the size or shape of the object I seen, but it maneuvered like no plane I've ever seen.

Like I said before I do believe in flying saucers or UFOs as they are sometimes called and this is not the first one I have seen, and I'm sure that it won't be the last. Could you answer my letter about this matter?

8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE AN "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SO SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
