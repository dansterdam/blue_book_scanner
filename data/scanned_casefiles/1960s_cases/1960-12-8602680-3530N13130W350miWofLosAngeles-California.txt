    Yellowish white object with short flashing tail.   Witness reports object was meteor-like.
    Took five or large min at approx 10° elev.          It is concluded that the witness saw a slow
    Described as being in level flight. Angle of        meteor and that because this was his first
    elevation was approx 20°. While flying on an        such experience he immediately discounted
    approx 360° heading the object passed more          the meteor possibility.
    slowly than a normal shooting star from 10°
    position to 250° position in apparent level
    flight. During observation approx 6 large pieces
    appeared to break off.

ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A LARGE PEA HELP AT WING LENGTH. OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING IN LEVEL FLIGHT. ANGLE OF ELEVATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES. THE OBSERVER REPORTED THAT WHILE FLYING ON AN APPROXIMATE 3.4 DEGREE HEADING THE OBJECT PASSED MORE SLOWLY THAN THE NORMAL SHOOTING STAR FROM THE 10 DEGREE POSITION TO THE 25° DEGREE POSITION IN APPARENT LEVEL FLIGHT. DURING THE OBSERVATION APPROXIMATELY SIX LARGE PIECES APPEARED TO BREAK OFF OF THE OBJECT. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR. AIRCRAFT WAS ON TOP OF ABOUT FOOT LAYER OF SCATTERED CLOUDS. THE OBSERVER WAS CAPT. JOHN F. DURFREE, 356TH AERC SQ, AIRCRAFT COMMANDER.

DUE TO THE NUMEROUS SHOOTING STAR SIGHTINGS, OBSERVERS JUDGMENT IS RATED AS RELIABLE.
