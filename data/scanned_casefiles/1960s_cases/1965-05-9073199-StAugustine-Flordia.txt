May 1, 1965

Dear Sirs:

On the night of May 1, 1965, at 9:00 P.M. (E.S.T.) myself and these (3) other boys, saw a fast moving object travel across the sky. An aircraft light is now very bright and moving high and fast, and was thought to be a satellite, but then began to dim and slow down, then brighten & dim - it brightened one more then it dimmed and stopped completely and disappeared. We viewed from 9:00 P.M. to 9:105 P.M. (E.S.T.)

Very truly yours,

[Signature blacked out]
