The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to a Mr. [redacted] from someone named John T. Spaulding. The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This refers to your report of an aerial object which you could not identify on 28 April 1965.

The object you described was identified as a satellite of the United States Satellite Detection Program. It is highly unlikely that a satellite could be mistaken for an aircraft, since satellites are tracked by radar and their orbits are known. I regret that I cannot be of more assistance in your sighting.

Sincerely,

JOHN T. SPAULDING
