Dear Colonel Manatt:

Regarding your letter of October 10, 1967 concerning a reported unidentified flying object on September 9, 1967, we are forwarding it to Mr. S. Scaggs of the FAA, who is responsible for controlling the air traffic at La Guardia Airport.

Mr. Scaggs would have the necessary records to give you the information requested concerning aircraft in the area on that date.

Department of the Air Force
Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Colonel Manatt:

With reference to your memorandum of October 10, 1967 forwarded this office by Mr. Edward Ingraham, Airport Manager, for our response, this is to advise that at the date and time in question, 0220Z, September 9, 1967, without further research the normal traffic generated by the four Metropolitan airports at the hour specified (LaGuardia, Kennedy, Newark and Teterboro), would assure a minimum of sixty aircraft simultaneous airborne on approach or departure to these airports and either over or visible from the Queens, New York area.

Hence, it would be impossible for us to ascertain not only a of this date, but even as it occurred, that the observed "bright white light" was not an aircraft. In any event, even had identification as a UFO been possible, the object obviously chose the weakest course, departing an already crowded airspace within thirty seconds after arrival.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
B. D. McKenzie
Acting Chief, LaGuardia Tower

Re: TDET/UFO

Dear Colonel Manatt:

We refer to your inquiry regarding an unidentified flying object
on September 9, 1967.

Our investigation reveals that no one in this area sighted any
U.F.O. on the date in question. In addition, our only activity at that time
was local traffic.

We trust that we have been of assistance.

Very truly yours,

UFO Observation 8 September 1967

Reference the attached UFO report from New York which occurred on
8 September 1967. This is an example of our ordinary investigation
and one of our results. I thought that you might be interested in
Mr. McKenzie's comments. I agree with McKenzie and in the future
will try to avoid the New York area. I didn't realize that New
York was so congested.

Dear Anyone,

On September 7, 1967, while in Van Cortlandt Park at 9:05, I saw a UFO. It was traveling at 500 feet (estimated) above the ground, in a NE direction. I observed this with another person. It had four lights arranged in a perfect diamond formation, the "neesel" light and the right "wing" light were red and flashed on-off once every second. We could easily discern metal between the four lights, and the other two lights were white and did not flash. It was moving at 800 mph (estimate) when a B-58 Hustler came at TOP SPEED following the object. The UFO then put on a burst of speed, disappearing over the horizon in one second. It easily outdistanced the B-58s! top speed of Mach 2.1.

A few seconds later another person came over to our bench. He then screamed "Look up there!" We followed where he was pointing and saw the same UFO proceeding E to W with at least a five mile lead on the Hustler following it. He was not here the first time.

It may be plainly coincidence, but three jet fighters were flying N to S over the area in which we sighted the UFO. They were there for one-half-hour. I live on the flight paths to Kennedy airport and am familiar with the landing lights and silhouettes of all civil aircraft. This UFO was flying at 500 feet above the ground, meaning it could not be a civil plane because the CAB prohibits aircraft to fly lower than 1,000 feet above a populated area.

(I can also say with certainty that it was a B-58 because I have read five aircraft books that give military plane silhouettes. It was a B-58. Nebody believes us, but now what we saw.)

Sincerely yours,
(Age 15)

P.S. Could you please send me Blue Book and any other information you have on UFOs.
