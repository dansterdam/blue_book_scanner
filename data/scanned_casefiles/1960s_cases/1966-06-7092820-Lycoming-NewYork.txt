Dear Mr. [redacted]

Reference is made to your letter regarding your unidentified observation in June 1966.

It is felt that you and your husband were observing the planet Venus on June 3, 1965 at 0900 EST. Venus was on a azimuth of 86 degrees and at an elevation of approximately 18 degrees. In the spring and summer Venus is rising in the east in the early morning hours, and eastward rising Venus would be at -3.5 on June 3 it would have been unusually bright. In the past, when Venus has been low on the horizon, it has been observed to change color and perform erratic maneuvers, primarily due to the increase in density of the atmosphere nearer the earth's surface.

We are unable to make an evaluation of your observation of April 3, 1966 without additional information. If you desire an evaluation of this particular sighting, please complete the enclosed PBD Form 164 as early as possible and return it to this office.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

1. Reference the attached letter from unidentified observations in June 1966. It is felt that she and her husband were observing the planet Venus. On 3 June 1966 at 0400 EST, Venus was on an azimuth of 66 degrees and at an elevation of approximately 18 degrees. In the early morning hours, and considering its stellar magnitude of -3.5 on 3 June, it would have been unusually bright. In this part, Venus has been known to change color and perform erratic maneuvers, primarily due to the increase in density of the atmosphere nearer the earth's surface.

2. We are unable to make an evaluation on her observation of 5 April 1966 without additional information. If she desires an evaluation on this particular sighting, request she complete a PTD Form 164.
