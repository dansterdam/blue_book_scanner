OCR Text Output:

Dear ____, We have noted your letter regarding your unidentified object observation reported to ___ General Counsel as of June 3, 1966 at 0400 hrs. Venus was observed at the time. It is estimated by 25 degrees. In the spring and summer months, Venus is frequently observed by many people well after sunrise or before sunset. At that hour, Venus is low on the horizon. It has been observed by many, particularly due to the increase in density of the atmosphere near the earth's surface. 

Should you wish any additional information, if you desire to inquire, please complete the enclosed vac1 form 152 as fully as possible and return it to this office.

Sincerely, 

C. EARL J. BEAN, JR.

Unidentified Flying Object Sightings

1. Reference the attached letter from [REDACTED] regarding unidentified observations on 5 June 1966. It is felt that she and her husband are reliable observers. On 5 June 1966, between the hours of approximately 10:30 PM and 1:30 AM, they observed a light, round like a star, moving slowly at an estimated altitude of approximately 10 degrees. In the spring and summer Venus is frequently observed and considered the station, but considering its stalled latitude of -35Â° on 5 June, it would have been unusually high in the sky. This fact, and the steady nature of the object, with no oscillation, and considering its stalled latitude, indicates this was not Venus. The object was not affected by atmospheric disturbances and clouds. The increase in density of the atmosphere nearer the earth's surface would have caused distortion, but this was not evident.

2. We are unable to make an evaluation on her observation of 2 April 1966 without additional information. If she desires an evaluation on this particular sighting, she is requested to complete a report form.

June 21, 1966

Dear Sir:
I am writing to see if you can solve this mystery - a strange phenomena. On June 3rd at 4:34 A.M. my husband and I were awaken and saw a bright object in the sky. It was low, about tree top high, and shining and right. It was bright as the headlights of a car and about 5 quite large, circular, bright on the sky. My husband and I watched it for 19 minutes and 20 seconds (and I also timed it and verified this). 
Am at a quite high point on the sky, it seemed like a glowing shell.
Also, on June 5, at about eleven o'clock in the evening, a bright light appeared in the sky, about the size of a basketball, that hovered for two or three minutes and then just faded away.
The ground surrounding under the object did not reflect any light.
