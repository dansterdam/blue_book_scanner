WX CLEAR     TO MILES     VISIBILITY
Description ONE OBJECT. ROUND. BRIGHT.
LIGHT (WHITE). METEOR. LIKE. AND
HAD TAIL OR TRAIL. 1/2 SLANT. APPROX.
NINE SECONDS. BEGAN CROSSING ROADWAY AND YIELDING
Direction of Motion W TO E. PARALLEL TO HORIZON.
Satellite: (AFCIN-LFZ, Phone 69219) CHECKED 23 FEB 60.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) POSSIBLY METEOR.

Radar Analysis (AFCIN-421) N/A

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) RULED OUT DUE TO
VERY CLEAR ATMOSPHERE. SPEED OF OBJECT.
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. RULED OUT DUE
TO GREAT SPEED.
Other MISSILE POSSIBILITIES CHECKED AND RULED OUT.

Evaluation of Source Reliability PROBABLY VERY GOOD.

Analysis and Conclusions: THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS OBJECT
IS CHARACTERISTIC OF METEORS - ONE OF
THE INCREASES DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS
METEOR LIKE. THE NUCLEUS VELOCITY
AND DURATION OF THE PHENOMENON, POINT
TO SUCH THAT OBJECT BEING PROBABLY A
METEOR. IT WILL BE OF THE MAGNITUDE DESCRIBED
IN SPEED, DURATION, ETC. THIS OBJECT WAS A
FIREBALL, ETC.
