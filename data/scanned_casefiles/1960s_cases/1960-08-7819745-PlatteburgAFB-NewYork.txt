SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative text on AF Form 112a)

While stopped at an intersection in my car, a sudden white smoke trail appeared in the sky. I watched it and it appeared to me like a trail from a 2" rocket. It burned out quickly. The smoke dissipated in a few seconds. A call to Base Tows divulged no schedule: firings. Subsequent investigation revealed it to be a private flare fired at an aquatic survival demonstration class.

At 14/22, 4 Aug 60, as I was stopped at an intersection at Plattsburgh AFB, I saw a bright white smoke trail in the sky. It started suddenly and made a bright path across the sky for approximately 5 seconds and stopped. This trail dissipated in approximately 15 seconds. No sound was heard, no aircraft visible. It appeared to me to be a rocket in flight as I have seen and fired many aerial rockets. I reported the sighting to the Plattsburgh AFB tower and asked if they had any reported rocket firings. They answered negative. Subsequently I was phoned with a request by "Blue Bottle" control to submit a written report on the sighting. Sighting report information follows:

1. Shape: Not visible.
2. Size: Smoke trail, about size of ordinary pencil held at arms length, tapering to fine point at end in which trail was moving.
3. Color: White smoke.
4. Number: One.
5. Trail was spiraling slightly moving almost in a horizontal plane as observed.
6. Sound: None.
7. Course: Easterly.
8. Max caught attention: The smoke trail.
9. Angle when observed: Approximately 30 degrees above horizon.
10. Object Path: Straight.
11. How did it disappear: Smoke dissipated.
12. How long visible: 5 seconds burning, 15 seconds until smoke dissipated.
13. Sighting: Ground - visual.
14. Date-Time Group: 04/1422.
15. Observer Position: 44° 53'N - 73° 29'W.
16. Weather: Clear, winds 340/5, visibility 35 miles.

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS: The Base Ground Training Section was conducting a class in Aerial Survival as a matter of instructional demonstration. Placed a white parachute flare over Lake Champlain from the area of 12001 to 15001. It burns with bright white flame and leaves a white smoke. Duration of flare was a short duration. Spiraling motion of smoke due to swinging of flare below parachute. Possible not visible due to distance. Probable low flight path an illusion created by angle of observer and drift of parachute.
