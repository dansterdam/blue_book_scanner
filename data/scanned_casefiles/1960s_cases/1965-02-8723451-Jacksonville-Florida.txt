The image contains a page from a Project Blue Book report document. There is a diagram showing a sketch of a UFO sighting, with instructions for where to place markers on the sketch. There is also a compass rose diagram.

The text in the document says:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the arc (or line) to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass rose to show where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, as will show any changes in direction during the course.
