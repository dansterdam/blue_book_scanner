BAIR 11365

1. WITNESSES:
Mrs. Jeanette Matthews, 3 Hills Drive, Davidsville, Md. At approximately 7:30 p.m. on 6 February 1967 Mrs. Matthews was outside her home and observed an unidentified luminous object in the sky. The object appeared to be moving in a south to north direction at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet. The object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

2. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
Mrs. Matthews described the object as round in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and luminous in appearance. The object appeared to be brighter than the surrounding daylight sky.

3. OTHER OBSERVATIONS:
Mrs. Matthews indicated that the object did not make any sound. She further stated that the object accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

4. CONCLUSIONS:
Based on the information provided, this incident appears to be a valid sighting of an unidentified flying object. No satisfactory explanation for the observed phenomenon has been determined.

The image contains two black and white photographs. Both photographs appear to show an unidentified aerial object or "UFO" in the sky. The object is circular in shape and appears to be emitting some type of light or glow. The background in both photographs is dark, suggesting the images were likely taken at night.

DAVIDSVILLE, MARYLAND 11365
REPORT SUBMITTED BY: JOE SMITH 
OCCUPATION: FARMER
DATE OF SIGHTING: 2-6-1967
TIME OF SIGHTING: APPROXIMATELY 8:45 PM
WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, WIND SSW 10 MPH
DURATION OF SIGHTING: APPROX. 5 MINUTES
DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
AT APPROXIMATELY 8:45 PM ON 2-6-1967, I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE MY BARN LOOKING UP AT THE CLEAR NIGHT SKY WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE NORTHWEST. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. I WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AS IT CONTINUED ITS COURSE. SUDDENLY, THE LIGHT STOPPED AND HOVERED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE. IT THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

I IMMEDIATELY WENT INSIDE AND CALLED THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SEEN. THEY DISPATCHED AN OFFICER TO MY FARM, AND HE ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE IT VANISHED. PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN, BUT THEY DID NOT TURN OUT VERY CLEAR DUE TO THE POOR LIGHTING CONDITIONS.

I AM A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THIS AREA AND HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. IT WAS A VERY STRANGE AND UNNERVING EXPERIENCE. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE CAN PROVIDE SOME EXPLANATION FOR WHAT I WITNESSED THAT NIGHT.

DAVIDSVILLE, MARYLAND
11 MARCH 1967
CASE NO. 6979282
On 11 March 1967, at approximately 1810 EST, this writer was called by Mrs. L.D. Trant, 10 Main Street, Davidsville, Maryland, and informed that she had observed a strange object in the sky at approximately 1750 EST. She stated that the object was hovering and that she had taken two photographs of it with her 35mm camera. Mrs. Trant was requested to bring the film to this writer's office as soon as possible for development and examination.
At approximately 1900 EST, Mrs. Trant arrived at this writer's office and turned over the exposed film. The film was then taken to a local photographic processing laboratory for development.
The two photographs obtained were of poor quality due to the poor light conditions and the distance of the object from the camera. The object appears to be round or elliptical in shape and is approximately 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter on the 35mm negative. No further details can be determined from the photographs.
This case is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for additional investigation and analysis.
