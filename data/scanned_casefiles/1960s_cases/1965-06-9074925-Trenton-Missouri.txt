This is to report a mysterious sight which I saw in the sky at 5AM Monday June 28th this year. ( Since that time I have watched the papers reports from others who might have also seen the same but just today I note mention in the Kansas City paper of vigorous observations and argument that you have a list of 637 sightings which are unidentified ).

I will start by saying that at the time and place mentioned above I was awake but still in bed in the northeast corner upstairs room of my home at 308 East 10th Street, Trenton, Missouri ( Grundy County ). When a bright light suddenly appeared on the west wall of my room. If I had been downstairs I probably would have dismissed the thought of anything, only car light shining in, but realizing that that was impossible in the upstairs room I got up and went to the east window to investigate. Directly in the northeast: I saw a fiery oblong about the size of three full moons a side by side and it gave me the impression that the sky was on fire. As I watched it appeared to roll and jerk and sent what looked like flames toward. It did not move otherwise as a flying object and it was so bright it hurt my eyes to look at it. But I watched it for about ten minutes. I gradually died away as any fire would have done, but it did NOT fall to the ground, nor move from its original location.

To my knowledge no one else in this community saw this. I did not see account of it in our local paper nor hear of any one else seeing it. I did not call any of the neighbors as they would not yet have been up, that early and my 37 year old father was the only other person in the home ( my home having left shortly before then for his work as custodian of the county court house ). And I did not wish to leave the window but to wait until it disappeared or I could decide what it might be.

If you have other reports similar or know what I may have seen I would appreciate the information. I might add that my son who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio wrote that I had seen the sun rising in the northeast. But he is mistaken --- I have seen the sun rise many times and there is no comparison. ( I am 57 years old ).

Most sincerely,

Trenton, Missouri 64733

Reference the attached letter from Mrs H G Raines reporting
an unidentified object which she observed on the morning of
28 Jun 65. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mrs Raines,

We have received your letter, in which you describe
the observation of an object on the morning of 28 Jun 1965.
On 28 June sunrise at Trenton, Missouri occurred at 449am
on a magnetic heading of 060 degrees. Your letter does not
mention the position of the sun with relation to the posi-
tion of the object which you observed. From the information
which you have submitted, the Air Force tends to agree with
your son's analysis of your observation. We also believe that
you saw the sun rising in the Northeast.

We have received no additional reports from this area
on 28 Jun 65.
