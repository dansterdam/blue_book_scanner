Subj: Unidentified Objects over Indianapolis, 20 Sep 65

Received a telephone call from Mrs. [redacted] of Indianapolis, Indiana, area code 317, phone [redacted]. Mrs. [redacted] spoke broken English and would attempt to speak slowly so that Major Quintanilla could understand her. She saw something flying across the sky the morning of 20 Sep 65 around 530 am and then again later that evening and then this morning (21 Sep 65) at around 530 am. It was a bright light, similar to a star, moving across the sky to the South and once to the North.

Major Quintanilla explained to her that she was observing an artificial satellite. He gave the times for Echo and Pegasus satellites. He also gave the times that these satellites would be visible this evening for her to observe. She was pleased with this information and was sorry to have bothered Maj Quintanilla. Maj explained that this is why we are here.
