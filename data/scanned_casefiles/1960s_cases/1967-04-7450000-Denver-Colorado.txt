10 April 1967

1. The following agencies were contacted in regards to this UFO report in an attempt to determine if object was an aircraft, fixed wing or helicopter.

a. Interstate Helicopters (blue and white chopper):
Negative - aircraft has not flown during past week.

b. Cutter Aviation (green chopper): Negative - neither chopper nor light aircraft airborne during that period.

c. Carco: Negative - nothing airborne in that vicinity.
They did report hearing (on radio) a tri-pacer call in at approximately 2245 MST for landing at Kirtland arriving from that direction.

d. Alameda Airport: Seven Bar Aviation: Negative - nothing airborne during that period.

e. Coronado Airport - Southwest Skyways: Negative - nothing airborne.

f. Flight Service Station (FSS-FAA): Negative - no helicopter or flight plans, transient or local, during that period. (Individual on duty very reluctant to look up desired information)

g. FAA Tower (very cooperative): The tower personnel on duty at the time reported watching a bright light in that vicinity for approximately 10 - 15 minutes duration. A check with ARTC Center revealed it to be a jet commander, inbound from the northeast, with high intensity strobe lights mounted on fuselage. Following identification of the object, the tower personnel turned their attention elsewhere. This sighting coincides with the time period in Mrs. Coy's


- page 8 -

report. (The glare created by the strobe lights would
probably distort the shape of the object being viewed.)
I have personally witnessed the rotating beacon on top of
the Empire State Building of an airborn distance in excess
of 75 miles at night in atmospheric conditions less desirable
than those which prevailed on the night of the sighting.
At jet altitudes, high intensity strobe lights would be
visible at distances well in excess of 100 miles, possibly
200 miles. An aircraft approaching Albuquerque from that
direction would maintain a fairly constant relative bearing
towards the viewer and with head winds varying between 50
and 75 knots, would be visible for a considerable length of
time - 20 to 40 minutes. During its approach, while maintaining
a constant bearing, it would appear to weave from side to
side and up and down due to airspeed, course and altitude
deviations.

2. Since missiles were not in the area and free balloons
cannot travel against the wind and all available information
indicates that the sighting was indeed the strobe light,
equipped jet commander, this incident is considered closed.

Dear Sir:-

I am writing you concerning
a F.O. of which I have been seeing
sometimes now. I would like
you to send this letter to who
ever is in charge of investigating
them now.

I have never seen them in the
daytime yet but have seen their
lights at night. When I first started
seeing them I thought at looked
like a big star and I called

(over)

my husband to look at was in
northwest and was looked the
light was moving to the north
and getting bigger and brighter and
at turned straight west blinking
red lights and disappeared. when
I first saw it was standing
still but just rotated until it
turned west and then it was really
moving and moved out of sight
fast. I have watched the same
one every night but now
it stays longer able to see
another in the north and in
straight out sometimes always
I can see the other one too and
flying plank red lights when they
like.
I work in a store about 4 miles
from my home on weekends
and have to come home at

was turned into our driveway
I was headed west coming down
road I had just come down
there was another bright light
which had been behind me
and it moved over and was
just over our garage. I typed
by the house quick and run
in got my husband to look
and got my shipyard dog to wait
in the garage while I came in
I closed the door and run into
the house. They scare me
because when they want to
they can go out of sight in minute
that why I wonder if they
could land in front of you on
deck. You I have gotten up in
the light and run them too. I
just cannot understand why the
airspace doesn't do something

7:36 P.M. at night.

Last Friday night April 27 as I was driving home. I turned onto 170 th. Lt. of which we live on the corner of and 24th St. I did not see anything until I got within a mile of home and then I saw this bright light out to my right moving right along with me not much higher than the tallest trees a light Price. It scared me and as I was not going to just sit at a county road I sped-it up to 65 but it stayed right along with me. I got to 24th St. and then I turned right as one 24th St. as I turned the light started changing to red blinking and chatted out and stopped dead still about 3 yrs out on us at home to me.

Here is the text from the document:

will something to do
our minds. I cannot rest
just thinking of whatever they
are and wondering if they are
watching us. There have been
other people within 7 miles of
my home seeing them to.
They surely cannot be balloon
because they move right into
the direction the wind is coming
from and disappear.

I hope you will read my
letter and give it to whoever
is investigating UFO. now.

PROF TO CHECK
SPACE TRASH
Hynek to Investigate
Libertyville Metal

Metallic fragments found on
a road four miles northeast of
Libertyville may be from a
United States or Russian space
vehicle. J. Allen Hynek, a Northwestern university astronomer who also
is an air force investigator of
unidentified flying objects, said
last night.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek said the
particles, the size of little
beads, definitely were not
parts of a meteorite but could
be explained as either "space
garbage" or residue of an unusual flare."

The fragments showered the
roadway in front of the home
of Edward Dehler, 302
O'Plaine rd., in Lake county
Saturday night. Dehler said he
was in the living room of his
home when a "brilliant flash"
lit up the room, altho the lights
were on.

No Sound with Flash
He said the 2-to-3-second
flash had no sound, but caused
"little green spots in front of
my eyes," Dehler said.

[Continued on page 2, col. 4]

PROF TO CHECK
LIBERTYVILLE
'SPACE TRASH'
[Continued from first page]

looked out of his picture window, thinking someone may
have driven into his driveway.
Seeing no one, he called to
other members of his family.
On taking a second look out
the window he saw smoke
coming from a spot on the road,
"Little red fires" lit up the
area, he said.

With his wife, Betty Jane,
and sons, Michael, 19, and Carl,
13, Dehler went outside and
investigated. He said
he couldn't touch the spot
where the fires were because
"it was too hot."

Finds Gray "Beads"
When he area cooled, Dehler found about a half dozen
"beads" of some kind of gray,
crisp material.

Dehler called Deputy Bernhard Walker of the Lake
county sheriff's police, who
made a report to the sheriff's
office.

A reporter for THE TRIBUNE
took a sample of the particles
along with Dehler's story to
Hynek, who immediately ruled
out a meteorite. He based his
conclusion on the fact that
Dehler said that the particles
smelled like burning rubber
and sulphur. Hynek said meteorites have no sulphur.

Dehler said he would take
the particles, which left a six-
inch wide and one-inch deep
tear in the roadway, with him
to Wright air force base in
Dayton, Ohio, Friday. He said
that there he air force will be
able to take a spectroscopic
analysis.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: [Partially illegible date]

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared first about the southern horizon. It traveled across the sky in a straight line and disappeared close to Polaris. It was traveling about 3 times as fast as any plane or as other aircraft I have seen at that height. It was definitely not a weather balloon or satellite as I have seen many. It was much too demonstrative, too fast for any man-made vehicle. A very high pitched within travel and its course.

When we remember that probably not one fireball in a hundred has its orbit computed, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a stream of meteoroids furnishing fireballs whose radiants lie near the celestial equator and 5° to 15° west of vernal equinox. Evidently the radiant of this 1967 fireball fits in quite well.

It is understood that Prof. V. D. Chamberlain, Abrams Planetarium, East Lansing, Mich., will publish a paper on this fireball based upon very extensive data from presumably different reports.

FIREBALL of 1967 April 5.52 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2392

This brilliant fireball appeared on the above date at 7:34 p.m., E.S.T. It seems to have started about 10 miles S.W. of Rochester, N.Y., and ended above a point very near Barrie, Ontario. It is believed that the sub-end point is quite accurate, the sub-beginning was certain. The solution depends on 8 reports from this side and 24 reports from Canadian side. All but one of the first lot were sent in by H. E. Roth, Project Director, Volunteer Flight Officer Networks, National Air lines, and the 24 Canadian by Bruce A. McIntosh, National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada. But for the invaluable help of both, no solution would be possible. We received only one report from a ground observer in New York, and two thirds of the Canadian were from Ottawa or near by.

The reports from airline pilots totally were from widely scattered points.

The fireball was very brilliant and observers were almost unanimous in giving its color as green. Venus was near its end point for most Canadian observers, and most state that the fireball was far brighter. Also two say that it was brighter than Moon. one that it was equal, one that its magnitude lay between that of Moon and Venus.

Probably about -10 would be near the truth. No long-enduring train was left. Both Venus and Belt of Orion served as reference points for a few observers. Even after discarding altitude estimates of 45° and over as being obviously impossibly great, there is wide range in the calculated heights and beginning and end points. Retaining estimates is wide range 87°, H1 is 121 km, H2 is 81 km, based upon 7 and 14 reports respectively. The observed duration, based on 19 estimates, is 5.64 ± 2.13 seconds. At path length was 226 km. the velocity, is 41 km/sec. This indicates a hyperbolic orbit, but due to the large average error in duration, it seems needless to calculate this. Hence the usual parabolic orbit only is given. The Ottawa reports give only a small slope which is borne out by the calculated data. Due to the great height of H2 the chances of finding meteor-ites is small.

FIREBALL of 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2396

This fireball is unique, so far as the writer knows, in that it appeared over the Atlantic and its solution wholly depends upon reports from four airplanes. These were kindly sent me by H. E. Roth, Project Director, Volunteer Flight Officer Network, United Airlines, Denver, Colo. It appeared at 16:36 G.M.T. These essential data follow in order: flight number, longitude and latitude of airplane, estimated bearing and altitude of beginning point, same for end point, notes of path slope, and duration of fireball's visibility:

817 16' 30" W, 53° N; 49°, 30°, 40°; 10.15 sec.
812 12' 50" W, 54° 35' N; 72, 15°,20°; 5-10 sec.
813 15' 00" W, 57° N; 116°, 10'; 113°, 0°; 5 sec.
814 15' W, 57° N; 93°, 16°; 123°, 0°; 3-4 sec.
611 10' W, 50° 50' N; 79, 0°, 19°; -1, slope 80° to S; 4.5 sec.

(a few data illegible or meaning uncertain)

It is obvious that as two longitude and three latitudes are given only to whole degrees and solution will be very approximate. The duration was 6.6 ± 2.7 sec, but its smoke trail lasted from 10-15 min. as seen from 811 and also assumed a zigzag shape. It was bright twilight at all stations. Sun reported rising at 815. Reported colors vary widely: probably it was green-white. 857 reported no break-up. 814 into 3 or 4 pieces, other three no comment. Estimates of brightness vary greatly due to proximity of sunrise point. 811, which was in most favorable position even if most distant, gives 5 to 10 times that of Venus. At night its zenith magnitude may well have been -12 or even more. For solution, the usual chart, but with scale 1mm represents 10 km was prepared. The most probable solution seems to be as follows:

Date                    1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
Began over              λ = 11° 00' W, Θ = 58° 47' N,   at 97 ± 46 km
Ended over               λ = 10° 26' W, Θ = 55° 47' N,   at 81 ± 50 km
Projected path           39 km
Path                     39 km
Radiant uncorrected      a = 92°, h = +22°.5
Radiant corr. for Δλ     a = 240°, ▲ = 3 = -19°

It is obvious that the solution is too approximate to warrant calculation of an orbit, but, despite the excessive probable errors in the heights, the conditions are too unique not to place this fireball on record.

BASHEV APPRAISES POLISH-BULGARIAN TREATY

Moscow Domestic Service in Russian 1030 GMT 7 April 1967--L

(Statement made to Moscow radio's Sofia correspondent Oleg Vlasov, by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivan Bashev--in Bulgarian, fading into translation)

(Summary) The visit of the Polish Party Government delegation is an important event for our countries. The talks between Gomulka and Gyankiewicz, and Zhivkov and other Bulgarian leaders were warm and cordial. They stressed unity of views on both bilateral relations and international problems.

Recently great progress has been made in scientific and trade relations between the two countries, which gives opportunities for both greater scientific and economic cooperation and for more trade turnover. Both delegations decided to create the appropriate economic organs in their countries: first, a bilateral economic commission for devising concrete practical measures--particularly for the further deepening of specialization and cooperation in all fields of industry.

Undoubtedly our cooperation in the fields of culture, information, and tourism will also develop successfully.

In the international area, both countries affirmed their wish to continue their efforts for European security, cooperation between the socialist countries within the framework of CEMA, and strengthening of the unity of the socialist community.

"The two countries resolutely condemned the aggression of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam and affirmed their readiness to give all help to the struggling Vietnamese people."

Both countries also drew attention the danger of the revanchist policy of militaristic and imperialist circles in West Germany in their attempt to obtain nuclear weapons for the Bundeswehr. Our countries consider it essential to make all efforts to mobilize the democratic and peace-loving circles of Europe against this peril.

As a result of the talks, a 20-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual aid was signed which will make an important contribution to both strengthening the national security of Poland, and Bulgaria and European security, and the strengthening of the unity of the socialist countries.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SEEN ON 6 APRIL

Sofia WA International Service in English 1440 GMT 9 April 1967--L

(Text) Sofia--A heavenly body moving from West to East passed over the town of Stara Zagora, in southeast Bulgaria, at about 1830 hours local time on 6 April. Observed with the naked eye, the body seemed to have the form of a sphere. When observed by means of telescopes from the local astronomical observatory the body, already in its zenith, seemed triangular in shape. Its radiance gradually faded and this made it difficult to take good pictures of it. But in spite of that, the photographs showed its triangular form with a poorly outlined trail.

Experts are highly interested in the phenomenon. It is their opinion that it might be a drifting meteorological balloon. As far as is known, no observations of such a body have so far been carried out in Bulgaria.
