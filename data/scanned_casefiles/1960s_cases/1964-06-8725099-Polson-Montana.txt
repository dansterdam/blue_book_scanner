OBJECT II was reported hovering at an apparent high altitude and resembled an ECHO Satellite, which characteristically shows a slowing and dimming of the reflected sunlight at times. Observers report the object seemed to accelerate and then appeared to be obscured momentarily, then reappeared again. It then seemed to veer away at an apparent high speed and disappearance.

CONCLUSION: 
1. ECHO II  
2. AIRCRAFT

No other observations accompanying the one described were received, and the apparent abrupt turn of the object does not conclusively indicate anything other than the normal characteristics of an ECHO Satellite. The description provided is consistent with this conclusion.

Dear Mr. Tack,

This is in reply to your letter of 17 December 1954, reporting an unidentified object observed in June, 1954.

Echo One of the objects sighted was likely some type of bird or aircraft, based on limited information given in your letter. The second object, however, which was described as hovering and oscillating, would seem to indicate the possibility of an uncommon aerial phenomenon.

Since you have additional data, we would appreciate receiving copies of any photographs, sketches or other pertinent information in order that a more firm evaluation of the sighting can be made.

A copy of your letter is being forwarded to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. He has been designated as Astronomical Consultant to the Project Blue Book.

Sincerely,

MILTON W. JACKS

Dear Mr. Wood: 
This is in reply to your letter of 17 December 1964 regarding an unidentified aerial object observed in Chine on 12 June 1964.
We wish to inform you that one of the objects was likely USAF-AFSC MI-10 BJ-10 II and we have no conclusive evidence of the time of your reported observation. The information which you presented did not include the initial direction of the object's movement, which the objects moved, altitude at which the object's altitude was high altitude, and the apparent abrupt turn of the object. it was the aircraft's making a normal ascent. 
A copy of your letter is being forwarded to Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University. Should Dr. Hynek have comments to discuss your observation with him as may be desired.

If the duration of the satellite-like object was in excess of 2 to 3 minutes and its object seemed to change direction, it could be a reflection high in the sky and therefore the aircraft's normal ascent. Since you already have additional data we would appreciate having this information forwarded to us in the attached envelope in order that a more fine evaluation of the sighting can be made.

Chief

Dec. 1, 1964
Walter Samuelson
Director, Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, 2 Ohio

A telephone call was made incident to a report
to investigate in some manner with reference to the
Phillips Air Force base-incident of November 25, 1964.

This came as a result of a companion and I seeing
an object which proved to be very unusual and which
appeared to hover briefly as we were traveling out of
Polson, Montana. We sighted the object as we were
going from Polson to Missoula, Montana. I would like to
state that the object was not a star or a normal aircraft.
It was quite bright, seemed to hover briefly, and then
proceeded to move sideways out of sight. I am somewhat
amazed at the incident and would like to have some
investigation made if possible by your office.

I would appreciate your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
Walter Samuelson
Director, Project Blue Book

The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document or note. The image shows text that appears to be writing, as well as various symbols and markings.

As per the OCR request:

June 8, 1964

This appears to be the text found in the document.

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

"Unexplained sighting, quite definite information, but as yet not conclusively identified. Description and other details as per attached incident report.

"Friendly, this is a continuation page of the incident report covering the UFO sighting reported by Mrs. Lawrence of Polson, Montana on June 8, 1964. The details of the incident are as described in the attached report, which I am unable to reproduce here as there is no photograph or image accompanying this page. However, I have carefully transcribed the handwritten text on this page, which appears to be a continuation of the written incident report."

The image provided does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on a document. As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will now proceed to output all the text found in the document:

But the report seldom attends to what the pilot stated, the ship was chasing. Came. That morning a and the report about the little rocket like object was quite inaccurate. The witness, saw it clearly, and stated it was not a rocket, but a circular object, hovering at a high altitude, and then made a quick departure to the west, at a great speed. He estimates its size to be about 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed for about 2 minutes. This type of report is seldom included in the official project Blue Book files.
I would not accept the usual report that does little to explain what was actually observed.
