Dear Sir:

When I was staying in Alaska my brother and a friend we saw a silvery thing come out of a cloud. The strange thing about the cloud was that it was lower than any other clouds in the sky. I would say that it was not more than 3,000 feet above the ground. We watched it for about five minutes and we noticed, it was an airplane. It was going out of the cloud and then it stayed in it. The cloud was just like a ball of cotton. Just big enough for it to hide in. We thought it was an airplane and we thought of it at all, until I was watching television the other night. It was about flying saucers.

If you want to write to me here is my adress:

Elma, Washington 98541

Sincerely yours,

(send 164)
