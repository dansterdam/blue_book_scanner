Dear Mr. Wilson:

1. When 2nd McCIoskey visited you on 29 March he requested that he would advise you as to the results of his examination of the matter of the object which you found or to determine the nature of same, which is in this case either some as automobile or from a light aircraft. It is entirely possible that it may have become detached from some aircraft. It is entirely possible that it may have become detached from same aircraft and fallen to earth and that it is not whatsoever connected or related to any activity that might be described as an explosive item and therefore not harmful in this situation.

2. Thank you very much for your courtesy in drawing the matter to the attention of appropriate authorities concerning the nature of this object in Washakie, Wyoming, and I remain with expressions of warmest personal regards.

Sincerely

FT. Washakie, Wyoming.
Feb, 8, 1961

Dear Sir:
I am enclosing a drawing of a circular object that I saw on the evening of Feb. 6, 1961 over Fort Washakie, Wyoming. This object was hovering at an altitude of about 300 feet and was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The object was a dull silver color and seemed to be made of metal. It had a dome on top and there were no visible signs of any protrusions, ports, windows or other appendages. The object was motionless for about 10 to 15 minutes, then it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.
I was with two other people when I saw this and they can verify what I have reported. I am 24 years old and have never seen anything like this before. I would appreciate it if you could let me know if you have had any other similar reports from this area.
Sincerely,
[Signature]

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

I shall believe it was some sort of device, possibly a missile or rocket, which apparently malfunctioned during launch or flight. The author seems to be analyzing the physical characteristics of the object based on the descriptions provided, such as the threaded sections, shiny chrome exterior, and separate components. However, without more context, I cannot make any definitive conclusions about the nature or origin of the object described.
