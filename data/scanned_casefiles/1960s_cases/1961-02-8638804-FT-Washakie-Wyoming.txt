Unidentified Object
Ft Washakie, Wyoming

Dear Mr Wilson

1. When Sgt McCluskey visited you on 29 March he promised that he would advise you if were able to determine the nature of the object that you found. At this time we have been unable to positively identify the object which you found or to determine the manner in which it was deposited in your field. It is our opinion that the object is not an ornament either from an automobile or from a light aircraft. It is entirely possible that it may have been positively detached and fallen from an airplane during flight. It has been positively determined that it was not designated to be an explosive item and therefore not harmful in this fashion.

2. Thank you very much for your courtesy in drawing the matter to the attention of the Air Force. Certainly in these times of trouble patriotism holds an important place in maintaining our security and democracy.

Sincerely

FRANKLIN A. JOSEPH
Lt Colonel, USAF
Inspector General

Dear Sir,

I am enclosing a drawing of a strange object I have seen by my neighbors. They are not able to identify it either. I am drawing it to your attention.

This might not seem dangerous but I do not know what is certainly in the heavy spotted end. There apparently dropped (from a height) slanted as near as I can make out a white or light colored object. I will try to get some more details, pointing out where it came and landed as nearly as I can.

Please forgive one if this is not quite some clear description, but I am not very good at making sketches. I am motivated to try to find out what it is.

If you can identify it by the enclosed drawing please tell me how it is. I would like to know if it is of explainable nature or not and will help it pending your advice.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Ft. Washakie, Wyo.

Ltr, Hq USAF (AFYIS-C4), 16 Mar 61, Letter From Nr.
Regarding Strange Object Found in Hts Field

1st Ind (001)                                                      APR 6 1961

Hq CGAMA, Hill AFB, Utah

TO:  AFIC (DCI), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1.   Mr. was contacted personally by Major Hutchison, 2705th
Airmunitions Wing, on 29 Mar 1961. The object was examined and
determined not to be an item of ammunition. It contained no explosives.
Mr. released the object to Major Hutchison and it was returned
to CGAMA for further research in identifying it. At this time positive identification has not been made, but it is the consensus of
all who have examined it that it is a decorative ornament from either
an automobile or a light aircraft.

2.   Mr. was interested in knowing exactly what the object was
and after commending him for reporting the matter, we promised we
would write him as soon as we had determined just what the object
was. When we have positively identified it, we will advise you as
to its origin and will send you a copy of the letter we write to
Mr. Wilson.
