INITIALS: G.S

ADDITIONAL REMARKS BY OBSERVER: Angular motion of object much greater than "NORMAL". Not as fast as a meteorite hitting atmosphere.

SUBJECT: I would know of nothing that would explain anything about this report. I would not wish to make any comments or suggestions as to the apparent intelligence and integrity of the reporter. If I would have to make a guess as to what it may have been, I would say it might have been something like the "ECHO" satellite.
