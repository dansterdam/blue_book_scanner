INITIALS CWS

ADDITIONAL REMARKS BY OBSERVER: Angular motion of object much greater than "NORM". Not as fast as a meteorite hitting atmosphere.

COMMENT: I would know of nothing that would explain anything about this report. I would say that I was very favorably impressed by the apparent intelligence and imagery to the report. If I would have to make a guess as to what it may have been I could only say it might have been the "USAF" satellite.
