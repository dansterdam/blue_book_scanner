PROJECT 10073 RECORD

2. LOCATION
St. Paul, Minnesota (2 Witnesses)

3. SOURCE
Civilian

10. CONCLUSION
Sighting: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Photos: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers sighted and photographed a top shaped object
that dropped from the clouds, hovered for a few seconds
about 150 ft off the ground, then shot straight up and
disappeared into the clouds.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
10 - 20 seconds

COMMENTS: The sighting was not submitted to this office
until well after 3 months had elapsed and at which time
it was really too late to investigate properly. Although
there is not sufficient clarity to determine exactly
how far away the object is or positively identify the
object, it is felt that suspended child's top would produce an image very similar to the image of the UFO in
the photos.

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
NNW to W

8. PHOTOS
Yes
No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Yes
No

SUBJECT: Request for Weather Data

TO: FTD (TDPTR-4)
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. In support of pending UFO evaluations, the following weather data are submitted:

    a. Middlesex, New Jersey: See attachment 1.

    b. Vista, California: See attachment 1.

    c. St. Paul, Minnesota: See attachment 2 for radiosonic observation on 27 Dec 66 at 1800L. Requested surface observations are as follows:
       1500L E808RKN/OVG 7   288/20/10/0806/031  / 619 1077 Stn. Pres. 29.420 RH=65%

2. Data sources were ESSA 78 Overecast, surface and upper-air history files and the Asheville, N.C. data files. Surface observations for Middlesex (Newark), New Jersey, were not available on 6 Oct 67 at 0300L and 0400L. Extraction or evaluation of all other weather data were adequate for all sightings.

UFO Observation & Photograph, 27 December 1966

St. Paul, Minnesota 55424

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of 27 December 1966.

2. Enclosed is the Polaroid photograph that was submitted to us on your December 27, 1966 sighting. It was determined that the photograph shows an apparent object rather than a processing or developing blemish. The object appears to be made up of two shallow, truncated cones placed base to base. However, because of a lack of clarity it was impossible to positively identify the object.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

DATE OF REPORT 14 July 1967

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS - ST. PAUL MINNESOTA
LOCATION St. Paul, Minnesota
DATE 27 December 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF IR QUALITY
P NRS One 2x3 polaroid paper print; one 2x3 copy negative; one 3x5 enlarged print
(second or third generation)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 67-66, submitted by Major Quintanilla, Jr., requesting analysis of the object in the enclosed prints.

2. ANALYSIS: The original 2 x 3 print shows an apparent object rather than a processing or developing blemish. The object appears to be made up of two shallow, truncated cones placed base to base. Smaller, darker, strangely shaped spots appear to protrude from the top and bottom. The upper surface of the top shallow cone has faint or lighter density striations forming "spokos". No range estimation is possible, therefore, the object could be nearer than in the vicinity of, or further than, the power lines. To further analysis is possible from the available photography.
