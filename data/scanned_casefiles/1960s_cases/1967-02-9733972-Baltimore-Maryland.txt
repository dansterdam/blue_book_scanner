The image contains a sketch or illustration of what appears to be a UFO or flying object. The object is depicted as an elongated, curved shape with fins or structures at the rear. There is also a sketch of a lamp or light fixture at the top of the image.

Dear Sirs,
On Monday February 27, 1967, a retired Admiral was on his way to school and sighted what he thought was a military plane or helicopter. However, as he got closer, the object suddenly went into a very rapid acceleration and left the area in a matter of seconds, according to the report. It was not only extremely fast, but the size of a bus or a large truck, the witness stated. 
He gave a very detailed description of the object, which he said had a smooth, metallic appearance and was elliptical in shape or cigar-shaped. It had no wings, propellers, or visible engines. He stated there were no portholes or windows visible on the object either. The witness did not hear any sound from the object. 
The witness expressed that he would very thoroughly appreciate any information your office could provide on this matter.

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram appears to be a sketch showing the angular position of an object above the horizon, as well as a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a scenario and draw a sketch showing the motion and direction of the object or objects. There is also a question about whether there was more than one object and how they were arranged.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
