Dear Sir,
Here is the story people in our class saw on March 16, 1964. March 16, 1964 at 9:50 P.M. - our class was going to a basketball game in Orange, Connecticut. When coming home, five or six people in our class, including myself, saw a large, bright, flashing light in the sky. It was going very fast. We watched it for about 2-3 minutes and then it disappeared. We thought it might have been a shooting star or an airplane, but it was much larger and brighter than any airplane we had ever seen. The light flashed on and off and was a very bright white light. We have never seen anything like it before. It was very high in the sky, much higher than an airplane. We were all very excited about seeing it. We would like to know if you have had any other reports of sightings like this one. Please let us know if you have any information about what we saw.
Sincerely,
[Handwritten signature]

We would like to recommend that your class read the book "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" by E. J. Menzel and H. Whipple. Published by Doubleday, this book contains an authoritative treatise on the UFO phenomenon by Dr. Donald H. Menzel, Director of the Harvard College Observatory. It explains many of the particular phenomena accounts for each category of UFO appearance, so that we think this book will be most helpful.

Enclosed are several copies of the new Air Force Technical Report on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. These too will be helpful for your class.

Sincerely,
MASTON M. JACKS

Dear Children:

Thank you for your letter of March 18, 1964, which you reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object, and enclosed a very fine drawing of one like that you observed.

Mr. George Adamski's books are classed as science fiction. The writings he and other adventure stores you may have read in school are just yarns of Cosmic Housand Leagues under the Sea type. Under present day conditions, they are exciting to read, but they are not necessarily valid accounts of experiences by the author.

The Air Force has investigated over 8,000 case reports of Unidentified Flying Objects during the past 15 years, and has never found one bit of evidence that these objects are any type of spacecraft from another planet. In almost every instance the reports have been of familiar objects under unusual circumstances, and therefore was not unusual at all. Sometimes experimental balloons high up give a most unusual appearance. Airplanes flying shiny white chests that reflect the sunlight or objects light from a city have sometimes baffled observers, but they are also phenomena such as meteors, comets, fireballs, like what you kids saw, are really startling the imagination even on a dark night. Airplane pilots have been known to report Unidentified Flying Objects which turned out to be more conventional objects distorted by Atmospheric conditions may account for an object be observed and appearing as something else. There are a number of situations which might arise where you may tell what you think you see, but simply could not recognize.
