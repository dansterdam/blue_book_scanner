SATELLITE 1963 DATA 1
FOR ORBIT LATITUDES

AUGUST 16, 1963

[The rest of the document contains numerous columns of numerical data related to satellite tracking, with dates, times, latitudes, longitudes, and other technical measurements. The data appears to be from multiple dates in August 1963, organized in tables for different satellites. Due to the dense numerical nature of the document, I cannot reproduce all the specific numerical entries here.]

The header indicates this is a satellite tracking data report from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, dated August 16, 1963, containing orbital latitude information for satellites.
