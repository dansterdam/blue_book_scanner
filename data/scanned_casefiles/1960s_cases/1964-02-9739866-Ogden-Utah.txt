PREPARED BY: John R. McNeill, Sr.

SUMMARY:
At 1930Z hours, 20 February 1964, a report of a UFO sighting was received from Ogden, Utah. Harrop is assigned to a traffic control point, Post #3 of the Defense Depot, and at 1420Z hours, 20 Feb 1964, sighted an object fall at an extreme rate of speed behind the north ridge of Ogden Canyon. He observed the object for approximately three seconds before it disappeared behind the mountain to the east - southeast of Post #3, Defense Depot, Ogden, Utah. Visibility at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, at the time was clear for thirty miles, ceiling unlimited, wind at zero ten kilometers.

1. At 1920Z hours, 20 February 1964, [redacted] reported that he had sighted a pulsating, pinkish-yellow object descend earthward at about 60 degrees at an extreme rate of speed at 1420Z hours, 20 February 1964. The object was in view for three seconds and during that span of time, the object did not diminish in intensity. The object approached and disappeared behind the north ridge of Ogden Canyon and at a east - southeast direction from the point of observation. Attention was drawn to a bright object apparently falling behind Ogden Canyon. His attention has been assumed to Post #3, Defense Depot, Ogden, Utah, for the past three years and has never made a similar observation.

2. At 2030Z hours, 20 February 1964, [redacted], Civilian Police Guard, Badge [redacted], Defense Depot, Ogden, Utah, was interviewed at Post #3, Defense Depot, a traffic control point of the Depot, and correlated the information in paragraph 14, AFR 200-2, dated 20 July 1962.

14a(1) - Shape: Round.

14a(2) - Size: Compared object to the size of a twenty-five cent piece held at arms length away from eye.

The preparing officer is a Senior Investigator, GS-9, Security and Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah. Preliminary analysis indicates that the observer is a mature individual who is convinced that the object was not a conventional type aircraft or a shooting or falling aircraft. He has witnessed falling disabld aircraft during World War II and does not make comparison with them to the object observed. The observer was the only reported witness to this sighting. There are no known experimental aircraft or missile firings other than static tests in the area at the time of sightings. All logical leads have been developed and reported with regard to this sighting.
