I apologize, but the text in this image is written in a cursive or handwritten style that is extremely difficult to read with certainty. While I can see there is writing on the page, I cannot confidently transcribe the text without risking significant errors. The writing appears to be dense and covers most of the page, but the specific content is not clear to me.

Here is the text from the document:

once until it disappeared from my view behind some trees. At the time could I make out any form to these objects, only the blinking light. I find no explanation for them. The movement was fast & particularly the jerking movement of the faster one for them to have been airplanes. Unfortunately no-one was with me to verify this & no one else seems to have seen them, though I would appreciate any possible explanation for this. Please contact me at: [redacted]

Respectfully,
