35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object moved in from the east when we saw it first and stopped. That when we could see the silver dome on it. I got about thousand feet up from the ground and made about 90% circle and moved off slowly to the south until it went out of sight.

It stopped approximately 1 minute. It was clearly visible and the bottom part was really glowing.
It looked as if it stopped approximately over Ent Air Force Base. I was about one mile from the Base when we observed the U.F.O.
