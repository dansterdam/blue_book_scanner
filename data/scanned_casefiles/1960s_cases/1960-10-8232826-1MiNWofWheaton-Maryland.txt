Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This will confirm our telephone conversation of this date concerning the unidentified flying object reported by your.

Since you furnished insufficient information for a complete analysis, I am unable to initiate any further action on this case at this time. However, I am returning the completed document to the commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, for any additional action he may wish to take.

Also included for your information is the latest department of defense statement on the subject of unidentified flying objects. This statement outlines the position of the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force regarding unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

POSSIBLE SIGHTINGS, HOWEVER, NONE WAS REPORTED.
NAVAL OBSERVATORY REPORTED NO SIGHTINGS, BUT INDICATED
THE OBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN A METEOR. HOWEVER, NAVAL
OBSERVATORY OBSERVED A METEOR WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FOR
THREE (3) MINUTES. ONLY REASONABLE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE
OBJECT OBSERVED WAS THE LANDING LIGHT OF AN ONCOMING AIRCRAFT.
WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT, BOLLING AFB AND ANACOSTIA NAS
ARE LOCATED DUE SOUTH OF WHEATON, MARYLAND. LANDING PATTERNS
AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WERE TO THE NORTH AT ALL THREE
AIRPORTS, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE OBSERVER SAW THE
LANDING LIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT ON A STRAIGHT-IN APPROACH,
THUS GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF A STATIONARY OBJECT.
