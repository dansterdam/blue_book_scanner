The image contains a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book, dated 27 Oct. 65. The report states that the photography was of a 1-inch roll of 8 mm movie film, which was examined for a possible UFO sighting between Oakland and San Pablo, California on 7 August 1965. The report provides an analysis of the film, including that approximately one-third of the 8 mm film dealt with the possible UFO, which was described as having a solid-looking, brighter-than-background image. The report concludes that although a double exposure cannot be ruled out, the analysis indicates the image could be classified as a UFO. The report is approved by Charles A. Benton and Robert L. Twigg.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

SUBJECT:
UFO REPORT
LOCATION:
Between Oakland and San Pablo, Calif.
DATE:
7 August 1965
PHOTOGRAPHY:
One 1-inch roll of 8 MM Movie Film
QUALITY:
Fair
1. PURPOSE: This report answers W.O. 65-109, regarding Photo Analysis of one roll of 8 MM movie film taken by Redondo, Jr. (Stamp: USAF), 7 August 1965, concerning a UFO sighting in the San Pablo area.
2. ANALYSIS: Approximately one-third of the 8 MM film that dealt with the possible UFO sighting. This portion was considered a UFO. There was only one image which might be considered as a UFO. This image appeared to be solid-looking, brighter-than-background, and seemed to exhibit motion. Most of the rest of the film appeared to be parts of the sky and collar. At one point the film shows a faint image of a second person can also be seen.
3. CONCLUSION: Although a double exposure cannot be ruled out, the analysis indicates the image could be classified as a UFO. However, any such conclusion is not definite and the image does not have the clarity which would allow uncontestable identification. This lack of clarity is most likely due to movement of the camera and/or object during exposure.
