P MRR       One 3-inch roll of 8 MM Movie Film

1. PURPOSE: This report answers W. O. 65-105, from Maj. Quintanilla, Jr. (TDEW/UFO), 
requesting Photo Analysis of one roll of 8 MM movie film taken near San Pablo, Calif., 
on 7 August 1965.  Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division, TDDPA, and the 
Photo Processing Division, TDDPR.

2. ANALYSIS: Approximately one third of the 8 MM film that dealt with the possible UFO 
was taken from a moving vehicle.  In this section of film the only image which might be 
considered a UFO has no apparent solidarity.  After close examination it was determined 
that the image was part of a larger image showing the top half of a man in a suit coat, 
with the smaller light toned image being part of the shirt and collar.  At one point, the 
faint image of a second person can also be seen.  The image of a man appears more clearly 
in the last section of film shown.

3. CONCLUSION: Although a double exposure can only be seen on the section of film show-
ing the sky, it is felt that a major portion of the 8 MM film has been double exposed.  
The phenomenon of the second exposure is believed to be a complex reflection because of 
the lack of distortion to the image and the appearance of the images.  A careful examina-
tion of the 8 MM film failed to reveal any discernible image that could be classed as a UFO.
