PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 11 Oct 67 21/2169

2. LOCATION: Blytheville AFB, Arkansas (4 Witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: See Case

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-45 Seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Radar-Visual (RADAR)

7. COURSE: Westerly

8. PHOTOS: [X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [X] No

10. CONCLUSION:
Radar: Other ( GROUND TARGETS)
Sighting: Astro (METEOR)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers sighted a light that when first observed appeared to be an exhaust of a jet. Approx the last 1/3 of the time it appeared to be two jet exhausts. The observer felt the object was no more than 3 to 4 hundred ft high and traveling in a westerly direction. Information was requested from Blytheville RAPCON but the only thing painted on the scope was a target moving 60-90 MPH due south.

COMMENTS: Radar operator felt he was painting automobiles and no UFOs. Three different Delta flight crews identified the object as a meteor which entered the atmosphere and broke into two pieces. These pieces traveled roughly two-six W-SW and were visible for approx 15 seconds.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

21 Feb. 1968

Talked to Lt. Mosley (SPADS)

On Oct 21 the McInlya -1 #6 Platform decayed at 1057u 5min. Lt. Mosley checked for visuals on the decay but only had one vis. form Turkey and it took place at 0948. I, Lt. Marano, asked him if these things often break up during re-entry and if a piece could have come down about 20 min. after the predicted decay. He stated that the objects often do break up as they start to decay and that usually they only list the time of decay of the main piece. However the angle of inclination of the object was only 46.7 degrees.

UFO Observation, 21 October 1967

Dr. Charles P. Oliver                                  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
American Meteor Society

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Blytheville AFB, Arkansas which occurred on 21 October 1967, between 0615 and 0622, CDT. The duration of the observation was thirty to forty-five seconds.

2. The observers sighted a bright white object to the south of the base. The object appeared to be moving in a westerly direction and then appeared to be two white objects, with red exhaust. The observers described as being similar to a jet with afterburners; however, there were no scheduled aircraft flights in the area at the approximate time and there were no radar targets that could be correlated to the visuals.

3. Do your records indicate that any bright meteors passed over the southern United States at the approximate time of the sighting? If so, could it have been the cause for this sighting?

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Two letters from you March 18 and another letter from an earlier communication from your APO will all be included to an earlier letter.

First; object of 1967 Oct.27- Report from Blytheville, AFB, of an object sighted between 0816 and 0822 CDT. I have two reports on that date of a bright fireball, one from St.Joseph, Mo. not 6,735 GAS, one by a pilot at Blytheville, AFB. In St.Joseph, Mo. on 27 Oct. the pilot saw it fall vertically on bearing 143, ex the first observed. From report of Capt. Lowe and conversation due to large difference in longitude, it could hardly have been same object. Neither fit the Arkansas report if data given there are right.

Second; report by J.A.Marshall for 1968 Feb. 25 20;02 CDT. His report fully fits description of a brilliant daylight fireball, and without hesitation I would so classify as such. I have no other report of this object. If you can get the report of the FAA pilot, mentioned in your note of Feb26, made near Jallet,Ill., I would be very glad to get it, as then I might be able to compare its appearance.

Third; unknown object of 1968 March 3 at somewhere near 9:40 p.m., CST, from Kentucky and Tenn. etc. I now have about 8 reports. They all could be classed as fireball; reports but for one thing: the duration given from 30 to 120 second. I don't think I have ever seen a fireball with such a long duration. If, as reported, it was on one end strike the Earth's atmosphere in miles/sec. I was almost to think the first 2 who reported simply experienced the curve of the Earth's independent motion. But I may be wrong. I sense that we have here a most unusual object.

Sincerely yours,

If you will plot on a map, the positions of these three reports and show the plane headings TRUE of each aircraft involved, you will note that when applying the answers to questions #8 and #9 in each case, that this could easily be three sightings of one and the same event.

There is a good possibility that this was a large meteor decaying in our atmosphere breaking into two major components. If this is the case, then certainly the event was taking place far to the south of all four (yoursighting included) reports.

These reports do not check out with any known satellite re-entries catalogued at SDC in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Since your inquiry brought to our attention the fact that these three pilot reports appear to be one object or event, pointing out at the same time the plausibility of this being a meteor, I have sent a duplicate copy to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for possible field recovery work.

If there is anything else I can help you with, be sure to write.

Sincerely Yours,
C. L. Roth

Here is the text from the document:

* When I first saw the object
it was low on the horizon at about
out 12:30 position, somewhat to the
left of Venus. I thought it must be a
star but could not figure what star. It
did not occur to me that it might be
a satellite (I still don't know). How long
the object was visible. I'm not really
sure. We were operating LAK to DNC and
had been in the air about 3:30 and all
of us were sleepy. I believe I saw the
object for 5 to 15 minutes, the other
crew members saw it only a few
seconds.

THIS COMMENT IS PURELY SPECULATIVE
AND CAN NOT NOR SHOULD NOT BE

Ref Item 10.

There were two parts - one slightly ahead of the other. My first thought was that they were two jet a/c with a landing lights on in formation - due to their relation and very low trajectory.

However as they closed on us I could see the orange trails- after they left my field of vision the copilot reported that they appeared to break up near the horizon.

This became visible about 20 diameters of the lights.

Passed out the a/c out of my vision.

When you determine what type satellite blown up this was I would like a check note on it.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

when just sighted it appeared as one brilliant object
Coming almost directly at us, within 20 secs as
this became an angle between its course and our
position we could see there were a object of almost
equal size, the 2nd object slightly smaller & close
behind the first was shielding, large wing portentous,
both objects were trailed by a long tail somewhat
to an average comet, not might that appearing as
the form of a small life in a dark nite.

they passed across in front of us on a very
flat trajectory only slightly above the horizon & beam
out to the west. we thought they were quite close due to their distance
& setting. Slight of (cut several times. I am)
them in after our setting. Some just flew (ID was) Born
Usig 3 secs.

Knowing nothing of their size these things
& shape besides always seem to be closer
when I first saw this Come. & I
turned my orientation, & came
to change my mind it could be closer
during yet in. Changing it was quite in some

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 21 October 1967 at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas.

2. Your sighting has been identified as being that of a large meteor. The meteor entered the atmosphere and broke into two pieces, these pieces traveled roughly toward the west-southwest and were visible for approximately fifteen seconds.

3. The meteor was also observed by the crew members of three different Delta flights, one near Alexandria, Louisiana, one near Brownwood, Texas and the other near Dallas, Texas. Also, the object may have been observed by a pilot near St. Joseph, Missouri, but there is not enough information to positively determine whether he also saw the same phenomenon or not.

4. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation.

SUBJECT: UFO Report                                    UNCLASSIFIED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

TO: TDY/DET/AUTO, Lt Marano

1. Reference is 976th Bombardment Wing Message 071254Z November 1967, Subject: UFO Report.

2. The following confirms information provided in telecon with Lt. Marano at 142100Z November 1967.

a. No scope photography is available because equipment is not available.

b. An object was spotted on the scope for a period of approximately five minutes. Technical Sergeant James C. Hunter confirms his belief that the PIBAL sighting was coincidental with the sighting from the control reflections.

c. In relation to the radar, the trajectory was due south, the velocity was 60-90 miles per hour, and the object is considered to have been low and slow sighting was on the search radar and not precision scopes.

d. All observers, who reported this sighting are believed to have been looking at the same object whose description of the appearance and maneuvers corresponded sufficiently close to indicate this was the case.

e. No additional radar stations are available which could be of use in identifying or explaining this sighting. The nearest radar facilities in the area reportedly are those controlled by the Memphis Center which, to date, has not confirmed a single sighting in the area. Undoubtedly, the Center's concern with traffic control and responsibilities contributes substantially to this condition.

3. In response to a request from the University of Colorado, this office is forwarding a copy of the Show 1, Log P Diagrams and the printed data for the two time periods nearest the sighting. This information will be dispatched on 27 November 1967.

4. This office has been unable to obtain the new questionnaire forms
