11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported a elliptical shaped object that was a pale white/yellow in color. There was also red markings and an attached pylon. The object appeared to be at an altitude of 2000 feet, and appeared to have three pylons, round tops, flat bottoms, and the red markings. Observer took picture of the object but so far refused to let the Air Force Investigating Officer see the photograph. The case is being carried as insufficient data because the witness has refused to provide the negative. He stated that he had a negative yet he claimed that he took the picture with a Polaroid camera.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: WIO                                                   24 February 1967

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting - 14 February 1967

TO: 1st Lt William F. Marley
     TDEV/UFO
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Reference is made to message number 03000 dated 14 February 1967.

2. An in-person interview with the observer was held at 1300 hours on 15 February 1967 at his place of employment, Feischild Hiller Corporation, Germantown, Maryland.

3. The interview revealed the following errors in the original message:

   a. (Para. b,3) - The observer indicated that the object rose and then departed directly away from him.

   b. (Comments) - The observer stated, at the interview, that the picture was not taken through the telescope. The picture was taken with a polaroid camera attached to a tripod. The picture did not show a light streak behind the object.

4. The following information relates to the type of camera.

   a. Large polaroid, brand camera approximately five or six years old (camera was not available at the time of interview). The observer stated that he had borrowed the camera from a friend and it was already loaded with film.

   b. Lens Opening: F 3.5

   c. Shutter speed used: 3 second time exposure

   d. Filters used: None

   e. Camera attached to tripod

   f. Observer stated that he did not pan the camera

5. Direction of the camera relative to true north: Approximately 120 degrees


- page 14 -

5. The observer stated that the object was judged to have been 1½ to 1¾ miles away from him at the time of the sighting. He was first attracted to the object when he noticed it move.

6. Concerning the observer's occupation: [redacted] stated that he used Fairchild Hiller (telescopes) and radio circuit systems for [redacted].

7. Education: [redacted] stated that he graduated in 1958 from the Ft. Hill High School in Cumberland, Maryland. He has no formal training of a technical or scientific nature.

8. General Comments: [redacted] stated that he has been interested in astronomy for approximately fifteen years. His knowledge of the subject was obtained on his own volition. He stated that this is no the first time he stated what he termed an Unidentified Flying Object. [redacted] stated he had transmitted photographs of other sightings to the National Science Foundation. The interview lasted for approximately one hour and the following information was obtained:

a. [redacted] received a general discharge from the Air Force after serving three years and eight months of a four year commitment. He was an Air Operations Specialist or Dispatcher at Lowry AFB, Colorado. His highest enlisted grade was A2C; his AFSC was 27130. He was separated from the service in July of 1963. Concerning the general discharge he stated that he was "issued" by a first sergeant who is now in a mental hospital. The general discharge was elaborate. He stated that he has been fighting this discharge ever since but at this point he has no hope of ever having the discharge changed.

b. [redacted] was very easy to talk with and he was well dressed and repeating. He seemed on the defensive throughout the interview. He kept matter what anybody told him. He stated that he would stand by that, no money or personal publicity, in fact he did not want his name released.

c. One fact that he was not able to explain was that he had a 35 millimeter camera attached to a 250 power telescope and even though the object was visible for approximately 18 minutes he made no attempt to take a picture of the object through the telescope. It was determined that he did not look at the object through the telescope but he could not explain why he did not take a picture.

d. One other fact that was not clear was that he stated that the picture was taken with a polaroid camera and yet he had a negative. He refused to allow me to examine the negative.

9. I am not able to decide whether or not [illegible] actually observed an object. I do feel that any further investigation would be a waste of time.

10. The enclosed picture was given to me by the observer at the time of the interview. I have indicated, with markings on the reverse side, how the picture should be held. The object is the large white dot above and to the left of center.
