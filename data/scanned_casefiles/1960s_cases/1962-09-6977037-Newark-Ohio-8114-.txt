The image shows a black and white photograph of a dark, irregularly shaped object (possibly a rock or fragment) placed next to a ruler or measuring scale. The ruler appears to be marked in inches, with clear markings from 1 to 4 visible. The object is positioned to the right of the ruler, allowing for size comparison. The background is white, and the image seems to be part of a scientific or investigative documentation process.
