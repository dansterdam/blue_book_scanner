The text in the document describes a sighting of two bright, pear-shaped objects that were observed in the sky over Dedham, Massachusetts on August 5, 1950. The objects were reported to have moved silently from east to west, and their color was described as grayish white. The duration of the sighting was around 30 seconds. The document provides some conclusions about the possible nature of the objects, including that they may have been a balloon or an aircraft, or possibly an astronomical phenomenon, but there was insufficient data to definitively evaluate the sighting.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a scanned page of an old document, specifically a letter from Warren W. McCurdy, Public Information, addressed to "Mr. ***" in Dedham, Massachusetts, dated September 15, 1960. The letter appears to be a response to an observation report and indicates that the matter is being forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for further investigation.
