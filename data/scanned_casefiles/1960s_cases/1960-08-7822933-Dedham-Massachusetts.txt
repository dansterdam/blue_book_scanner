Twice as bright as Echo. First seen in E. Curved in horseshoe path and disappeared in NE. Starlike, twice the size of Echo. White in color. Seemed to travel 3-4 times as fast as Echo.

11. COMMENTS
Maneuver performed by the object rules out possibility of being a satellite or astronomical body. Witnesses are located on the SW edge of Boston and there are a large number of a/c both large and small, civil and military, flying in the area. Is possible that the object observed by the witnesses was a/c. However, there is insufficient info in the report to allow a valid conclusion.
