11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched two lights disappear into the background lighting. The objects were moving; slower than a meteor and much faster than a jet aircraft. For most of the sighting the object was a white light moving horizontally with the ground. Then a small flare occurred from the back of the light. The duration of the flare was probably less than a second. After the flare stopped, a smaller red object moved from front of the main white object and was proceeding ahead of it when both were lost in background lighting.

Dear Sir:

On Monday, September 12, at approximately 8:35 P.M., I saw an object in the sky which I could not identify. I would like to point out that I am 17 years old and have been intensely interested in all aerospace items since I was 9 years old. I receive an aerospace magazine called Technology Week, and I am applying now to enter the Air Force Academy. I say all of this only to point out the validity of my observation. I live in San Bernardino, California, where Norton Air Force Base is located. There is a range of mountains north of the city which run west to east. I was looking up at the sky towards the east when an object with the light intensity of a satellite came into my view heading north.

Its speed was much faster than that of an orbiting satellite, plane, or jet aircraft. It was also much slower than any meteor that I have seen. The object was traveling parallel with the ground and there was absolutely no sound that I could discern emitting from or following the object. As I watches it head away from me, a small flare occured behind the object for a second or two. Then from the white object a smaller red object proceeded from the front of the larger one to a short distance in front of it before I lost both in the haze towards the mountains. The red object seemed to decline just a bit towards the ground, but this may have been due to the angle at which I was viewing it at that moment.

I am positive I did not see an orbiting satellite or an air-

craft of any type. I also do not believe that what I saw was
a meteor or a bolide. My reasons for this are as follows:
there was absolutely no trail of any kind visible; the ob-
ject traveled parallel with the ground; the speed was too
slow for a meteor; there was no sound of an explosion; the
small red object left no trail that was perceptible as it
headed away from the larger object. I hope you will send
me your explanation of the object or one acknowledging my
sighting and/or your inability to identify it.

Thank you,

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Though I cannot estimate the speed as distinct at this aspect, I was almost positively that it was faster than any previously sighted and slower than a meteor for the aspect of the sighting the height was a high one moving heavily at a high speed. I was unable to tell when a small place succeeded the first object at the same track at the same height. Possibly less than seconds at the place. Though I was not quite sure, it seemed to me that the object was proceeding almost to it then, not more than two to three seconds in lighting.
