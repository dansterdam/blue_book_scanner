Barcavicius - that certainly must be right along the easternmost portion of the craft. The bright lights were in motion, as were the object itself. The speed of the object is estimated to be greater than 3 G forces. How certain is your account sir, as you state. The object resembled no known shape or design but appeared similar to a diamond or egg shape - elongated. The lights on the craft seemed to be either rotating or flashing in sequence, but definitely not synchronized. There appeared to be no exhaust trail or contrail of any kind, and the craft itself appeared to be noiseless.

Dear Dr. Harder:
(3) Reporting in the middle of a case.
27. Your letter summarizing the various kinds of reports, and the instructions on reporting a sighting were most helpful. Thank you very much. We shall endeavor to follow them more closely in the future.
28. ____________________ NOT SUBSTANTIVE

29. I am sorry to continue to bother you, but would appreciate your advice on the following:
I have just received a call from an architect in New York City who reported a strange sighting. He said it was a large, bright, metallic disc-shaped object which hovered over his apartment for several minutes at midday. He said many neighbors saw it too, and that it was quite close - perhaps 500 to 1000 feet up. I have his name and address, and would appreciate your suggestions on how to proceed with this case. ________________

The text in the document is as follows:

"The sketch, date is 9-8-62. appeared to show one man was standing on the ground, the other seemed to be a little over 6 feet tall. His hat was distinctive, being tall and narrow with a broad brim. The sketch was of a dome-shaped object with a ring around it. The ring was lighted and pulsating. The dome seemed to be bluish-white in color."

The image appears to contain a sketch or drawing rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts a series of dark shapes or objects, possibly representing an unidentified aerial phenomenon or object.
