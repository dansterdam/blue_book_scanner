Girl Sticks To 'Sauce'?

By GERRY CROSBY
At 11:30 p.m. on July 29 at 18 - year - old Florida girl and her younger sister saw what they claim was a "flying saucer" in the Jewfish Creek area.

At 2:30 a.m. July 31, a mere three hours later, traveling north on the same highway, they again saw a weird object floating in space. The second occurrence was in almost the exact spot of the first.

Jewfish Creek saucer reportedly looks something like this. It was seen twice but much...

Saucer Story...

Homestead, Fla.
July 1967

Officers listened, some fascinated, others with eyes full of doubt, some in complete disbelief.

The Pompano Beach girl said she was driving to Homestead at a small Barbara's small Ford when she saw a car on the highway from the rear side, "lights from the rear side," she said. "I was near view mirror." Barbara noticed light in a car in front of the large light stayed in the middle of the road and seemed to be eight feet above the ground.

Still not believing anything amiss and blaming the vision from behind the car, Barbara asked her companion, who was driving, to look at the headlight, or possibly a motor cycle.

However, the light came closer to the car and the teenage driver, who played backwards, recounted a settling scene no car headlights or wheels, only a burning yellow light, panicked and pressed the accelerator, hitting speeds up to 100 miles per hour.

Unlike some of the reports later termed the UFO as a constant fear, Barbara said there was a constant fear, that was higher pitched than the motor of her speeding car.

According to the Pompano Beach girl, the round-brilliant object continued to overtake the car, surveyed up a few feet and looked as if it was going to land on top of the car.

An automobile approaching duly appeared and Barbara said a tremendous bright yellow glow coming from the object, covered the road for a second and then disappeared.

After telling the story to her parents, Barbara and her sister rested for two hours. Barbara said she felt she should return to Pompano Beach that night to avoid morning traffic. She again encountered herself that the episode was real, and their toy poodle. "Bo Peep" started the journey north on U.S. 1.

South Dade's UFO's Probed

By GERRY CROSBY
The recent increase in reported sightings of UFO's (unidentified flying objects) may possibly result in South Dade becoming the new focal point of the University of Colorado's UFO investigation, being sponsored by a grant from the Air Force.

NICAP (National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena) members have been carrying on a study of UFO reports under the direction of Dr. John Stokesberry, a psychologist, that South Dade may well become a major research area.

Stokesberry, is strictly scientific. Members go into the field, speak to people who claim they have sighted UFO's gather other pertinent facts, and send the reports to Washington, D. C. and the University of Colorado.

Stokesberry visited the Perrine District of The News Leader as a result of a "flying saucer" story published August 2.

The story went into a detailed report of Bayfront-Rd. Perrine residents sighting a UFO.

NICAP was also interested in contacting Perrine, as well as the other South Dade persons mentioned in the story.

Stokesberry's file on South Dade residents, who have sighted UFO's, is quite impressive. From one end of the Air Force's project to the other, toward UFO's is critically being studied.

Stokesberry and planning sessions last November and December, with the director of NICAP, met at the University's Department of Physics and Astrophysics.

NICAP is currently exploring all phases of the UFO phenomenon, including the logically explainable incidents as well as the unexplainable.

Stokesberry will continue to work with the University, and South Dade residents can be expecting further investigation.
