Dear Sirs:

I would like to ask you some questions about "Flying Saucers?"

1. Are there such things as Flying Saucers?
2. Is this where do they come from?
3. Are there any people piloting these saucers?
4. Is so what do they look like?

"The Day I Think I Saw a Flying Saucer"

On the day of April 26, 1961 my friend [redacted] and I were playing in his house. We came outside because it was a hot day so we came out. [redacted] glanced up in the sky, he said, "Look [redacted] a flying saucer."

Immediately I looked up, it was silver-like object in the sky. First it came out of nowhere and then just vanished into the sky. The odd of been a plane, but I'm pretty sure it was a Flying Saucer.

P.S. "Please try to answer to the questions I send with this letter, I want to prove to a girl and my friends that there are such things as flying saucers."

I would like to learn more about them and details of them.
