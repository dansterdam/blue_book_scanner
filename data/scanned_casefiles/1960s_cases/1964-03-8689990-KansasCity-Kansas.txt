Sir,

Sometime ago I sent in my U.F.O. sighting and have not as yet received an answer reply on it, I'd appreciate it very much if you would, please send me copy of Air Force answer - the one with sketches of several round flying discs and the reddish U.F.O. from the moon during early hours over Miami, Florida, also if can, the last two I had seen different times. During my lifetime have seen several over here.

Pan American Pilot's
19 March, 1964

AIRLINE PILOTS REPORT EXPLODING UFO

March 19 - A most extraordinary UFO report was issued by Pan American Airlines pilots, Captain E.D. Morris, and Captain W.A. Bottheos.

Captain Morris was piloting an airliner containing 42 passengers bound from London to New York, and Captain Bottheos was the pilot of a DC-8 with 77 passengers, en route from New York to Frankfurt, Germany.

Both observed a strange object travelling at high altitude on an apparent north to south trajectory, which unexpectedly exploded with an immense brilliance, parts of it falling downward, trailing columns of smoke.

Neither pilot has been able to identify the phenomenon.

Text found in the document:

CLUB HOUSE DRIVE, HIALEAH PARK-MIAMI, FLA-164

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a tree-lined road or drive, with tall palm trees on both sides creating a symmetrical corridor leading to a vanishing point. The trees are silhouetted against a lighter background, creating a stark contrast. The number "164" is visible in the image, and the text indicates this is located at Hialeah Park in Miami, Florida.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 22, 1964

ASTRONOMY

Brilliant Evening Star
Venus outshines all other planets and stars. The vernal
equinox in March heralds the beginning of spring in the
Northern Hemisphere.
By JAMES STOKLEY

> SHINING MANY TIMES more bril-
liantly than any other star or planet now
visible in the evening, Venus is becoming
more and more conspicuous. Coming into
view in the west long before the sky is
dark, it remains visible during March for
about three hours after sunset.

On March 1 its distance from earth is
about 94.4 million miles, but by the end
of the month this is reduced to 85 million.
It will continue to approach us until it
swings between sun and earth in mid-June.
At the beginning of March you will be
able to see Jupiter low in the west in
the early evening, a little below Venus.
Although only about an eighth as bright
as Venus, Jupiter is still very brilliant.
However, it is drawing toward the sun in
sky. By March 31 you will have to look
low in the west, soon after sundown, to see
Jupiter. It is now gradually drawing away
from the earth and at mid-March its distance is about 546 million miles.

Other Planets
As for the other planets, sometimes visible
to the naked eye—Mercury, Mars and Saturn—they are too close to the sun for
observation this month.

The accompanying maps show the sky
as it appears about 10 p.m. you can find
of standard time, on March 1, an hour
earlier on the 15th and two hours earlier
on the 31st. Venus barely gets on, while
Jupiter has already set by the time mentioned.

Sirius, the "dog-star," is part of Canis
Major, the great dog. It is the brightest star
in the sky and is visible in the south. Above
it is Procyon, in the lesser dog, Canis Minor.
And still higher are the bright stars Castor
and Pollux in Gemini, the twins.

To the right of Canis Major, and a little
higher, stands the brilliant constellation of
Orion, the warrior. This has two stars of
the first astronomical magnitude: Betelgeuse
(above) and Rigel (below). Between them
is Orion's belt, formed by a row of three
stars.

Still farther to the right (shown partly
on the northern sky map and partly on
the southern) stands Taurus, the bull, with
brilliant Aldebaran. This star is reddish in
color. And above Taurus is Auriga, the
charioteer, with creamy-white Capella.

High in the northeast you can see Ursa
Major, the great bear, of which the familiar
big dipper is part. In this group are the
pointers, whose direction leads you to
Polaris, the pole star, part of Ursa Minor,
the lesser bear.

in the Northern Hemisphere, and of winter
in the southern. In 1964 the equinox occurs
at 9:10 a.m., EST on Friday, March 20.
The next full moon comes on Friday, March
27, at 9:49 p.m., EST. And so Sunday,
March 29, is Easter.

But in some years it doesn't work out
so nicely. According to the actual Easter
rule, formulated by the Jesuit astronomer
Clavius, who helped Pope Gregory XIII
return the calendar in 1582, it is not the
actual equinox but the 21st of March, its
average date.

And it is not the astronomical full moon,
but the fourteen-day-old moon, measured
after new moon. The true full moon's age
is more nearly 15 days. Sometimes Easter
comes on a day quite different from what
you might expect on the basis of what is
happening in the sky.

Determining Easter Date
There is a rule for determining the date
of Easter from the year number, but it
involves a considerable amount of calculation. Easter can actually be determined with
the aid of a series of tables, which are used
by ecclesiastical authorities. These were
issued by authority of Pope Gregory XIII
nearly four centuries ago.

If the 14th day of the moon, or paschal
moon, falls on March 20, it will be a day
ahead of the ecclesiastical equinox. If the
20th is a Saturday, the paschal full moon
will come on Sunday, April 18. Then Easter
will be the following Sunday, April 25.

SCIENCE FIELDS

ENTOMOLOGY
Indian Insect
To Fight Wool Pest
> NOOGOORA BURR, Queensland's worst
weed pest, and a part of serious problems
in New South Wales, may be brought
under control by an Indian insect,
32,000 larvae of which are now in Brisbane.
The cost of the burr on Australia's wool
clip is estimated at between $600,000 and
$700,000 a year.
The scientist who collected the larvae is
John Mann, director of the biological section of the Queensland Department of
Lands, who has recently returned from
India.
In his four-month mission he collected
sufficient numbers of the burr-destroying
insect, Nuperhaea antenata, to launch field
trials in Queensland.
The trials will establish whether the
insect, a boring beetle, will be effective
under Queensland conditions in bringing
noogoora burr under control.
The insects are in quarantine in the
Lands Department's Sherwood laboratory,
where they will be held to complete their
development and emergence from the larval
stage. They will be ready for field tests,
which will begin less than a year from now.

ENGINEERING
Improved Traffic Flow
Can Save Many Lives
> MORE THAN 22,000 lives now lost on
the nation's highways could be saved each
year, if modern freeway design and operating characteristics were applied to more
roads and streets, an automotive safety engineer predicted in Detroit.
About 12,000 deaths caused by one car
leaving the road and overrunning or striking an obstacle could be eliminated by
removing trees, sharp drops, and steep
slopes from the immediate area wherever
possible.
Elimination of two-way traffic on all
streets would save almost 11,000 lives lost
due to collisions involving other cars and
pedestrians. One-way traffic on all streets
would also keep the traffic flowing faster.
These conclusions are based on a review
of fatal accident statistics from 1900 until
the present. Between 1920 and 1930 the
number of fatal traffic accidents increased
more than 2,000 each year. A sharp break
occurred in 1930 and the increase since that
time has been less than 500 per year.
Passenger car improvements have included
the development of enclosed passenger areas,
safety glass, improved brakes, steering and
lighting, and a significant lowering of the
center of gravity on modern cars. Improved
driver training and further design improve-

Science News Letter for February 22, 1964

ments in the field of safety devices will help
the situation somewhat.
But better vehicle design will only partly
reduce the impact in collisions, K. A. Stoner,
an engineer with General Motors, told the
A*
But if the 14th day of the moon is on
March 21, and that day is a Saturday, the
next day, March 22, is Easter. This is the
earliest that it can occur.
This last happened in 1818, and does
not happen at all this century. In 1913 it
came on March 23, in 1940 on March 24,
and in 1951 on March 25. The last time
Easter came on April 25 was in 1943—it
will happen again in 2038. In 2011 it will
come on April 24, and in 2000 on April 23.
In 1962 it came on April 22 and this will
happen again in 1973.
You will notice that if the pascal full
moon comes on a Sunday, Easter will be
the following Sunday. This rule was established in 325 A.D. by the Council of Nicaea,
to make sure that Easter would never coincide with the Jewish Passover, which comes
at the full moon after March 21. If that
full moon comes on Sunday, it is the beginning of Passover, and Easter comes a week
later.
In recent years there has been an active
movement to stabilize Easter, perhaps on
the second Sunday in April, which would
provide that it would become effective only
after other nations had agreed to do the
same, which so far they have not done.

• At 1:25 a.m. Friday March 13, 1964 actually Saturday early morning, a redish white silent slow moving UFO appeared after a bright flash of light flashed through yours truly's bedroom window which faces toward the north, northeast and northwest, the Miami International airport is in the northeast section, this is where the UFO was flying over near when first observed then turned toward the north much more slowly and seemed to hover completely motionless and looked just like a star then and disappeared for two second and reappeared lower in the north, northeast hovering motionless, still looking like a white star for two minutes then vanished, it had no tail, made no noise, was a circular shape and completely clearly outlined and was a solid object. It seemed to have all interest focused on the whole airport always keeping it within the radius circle of flight. This was also witnessed by my father and grandmother. It was the size of a peanut out of the shell as seen by the naked eye, total time - 5 minutes. UFO Club, WFAC Station, c/o Frank McKisic, 3731 N.W. 1st Street, Miami, Florida, 33126.
