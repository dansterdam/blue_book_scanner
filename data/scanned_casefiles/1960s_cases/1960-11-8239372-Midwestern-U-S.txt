QUALITY OF UFO SIGHTING IN SURVEY 51 WG, ETC.

1. At about 0910 called FAA. Thomas H. Tolcott, FAA, substantiating in
his sighting could be the result of a visual device. In other words, a "flying
satellite" was launched at 0910 on a 90 trajectory. He said that soon the
observers saw position was in increasing, as the object was at the time, the object
would appear to be burning, when in reality it was reflecting, such as he could see
this was a frequently observed occurrence than his "case", was the object, photo was
burned out. the object is in sunlight and the strongest eye cannot distinguish between
the reflection and the missile's surface.

2. At about 0620, called the [REDACTED] observer who was on
duty in the control tower for the National Airport. He said that the other observers
to the Northeast Area Southeast of his position and observed to be on or at 180
for 6-10 sec. it appeared to be burning, and that seen to the fact "this definition
with the position of time".

3. 25 Nov 60 called Indus tries to determine if a balloon launched by
them could be responsible for some of the reports of sightings. From the information
received from them, a balloon released by them at 0620 was probably responsible
for the sightings reported over Illinois, Michigan and Northern Michigan. It asked
from South Texas, North Dakota, east to Northern Michigan.

4. Called the Greene 4300 Sector to determine if any traces in reports of
responsible for the reports that there in the California APS area. They had an
analysis of such a door, even though they ordinarily did know an aircraft's
position 20 miles out. by a mile. 200 conjecture may have light.

5. Major Lane, Intelligence officer of the Detroit Air Defense Sector, said
that there was a fairly fit "something" traveling west to the area of Detroit and
this might possibly be a missile.

(U) Unidentified Flying Object Report

A report of an unidentified flying object was provided the Base Clearance Officer by the Base Operations Officer at Scott AFB, and A/2C G. R. Hamilton, 1st AMTG, the civilian fireman at Scott AFB, and another civilian employee, Mr. [redacted], Operations Officer Centralia, Illinois, provided a similar report to the Base Operations Officer when he reported for duty at the USAF Hospital, Scott AFB. All parties appeared to hover for some time and then disappeared in a northeasterly direction.

The St. Louis Air Route Traffic Control Section indicated there were no UFR sightings in the area of the sightings at the time specified. The 7986th ACGW Radar, which has a 200 mile radar capability, reported no aircraft in the area of the sightings at the time specified. A St. Louis broadcast station indicated in a news summary that a scientific balloon was released in South Dakota early the morning of 23 November 1960. The U.S. Weather Bureau, St. Louis, Missouri had no knowledge of the balloon. Many other persons have been quoted by the press and radio in the St. Louis area as having seen a fiery object fall East of St. Louis, Missouri. This is considered to be a coincidence, however, as the objects described herein were a brilliant white, and were stationary during part of the sighting. The fiery object was a meteorite, according to radio reports. This headquarters is unable to determine the nature of the object, and is forwarding this information IAW paragraph 136, AFR 200-2.

7. The now famous Mid-west sightings of November 23, 1960.

The sightings of November 23, 1960, were concluded to have been sightings in Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas. The factory at Chillicothe, Missouri, was the beginning of this satellite's relatively flat trajectory. This factory at Chillicothe on a Northeast azimuth was declining into another state within a few minutes after sighting it.

If it can be determined that a scientific balloon was released in South Dakota early the morning of 23 November 1960, it is quite possible that the "jet stream" and wind at a given above could have carried the balloon to the area of sighting, at the times reported. Change in altitude could account for the apparent change in direction and disappearance. Also, from previous knowledge of similar incidents, aerial photos can be seen for hundreds of miles. Inasmuch as Wright-Patterson AFB is northeast of Scott AFB, it is feasible that an ARDO test was being undertaken involving a photo flare.

1. Inclosure: Attached copy of a letter to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center from [redacted], dated 6 December 1960, by Maj [redacted] to Maj [redacted], who answers certain [redacted].

2. Specific information concerning the launching of three US area surveillance times, burning times of the various stages, and altitude of each and are hereinafter classified information.

3. [redacted] would be advised that during the initial flight path over the mid-west area of the United States, specifically northeast from Cape Canaveral, the initial reading was generally parallel to the east coast of the United States and increasingly northwesterly. While in the Chicago area, the classification site of the tracking data was Chicago, 025 deg, 035 mi. At the International Falls, Minnesota, field station, an operation was conducted. Several descriptions by the witnesses also makes some data available in form heretofore with other launchings.

4. Only one balloon launching, other than regular weather balloons, could be extended for 23 November 1960. This balloon was launched by [redacted] from Sioux Falls, South Dakota at 0907 on 23 November 1960. This balloon was of the Raydac type, reached a height of 100 feet and flew at an altitude of 115,000 feet. The launch was from Sioux Falls, Minnesota, which is generally northeast to Yankton, Wisconsin, where it moved generally northwest to Waunakee, Wisconsin where it passed its nearest point to Sauk City, which was located at 0132 on 23 November 1960.

5. There was a general tracking investigation undertaken on the evening of 23 November 1960. To its possible that the atmospheric winds associated with this phenomenon, coupled with the settlement characteristics of the large number of reports subsequent to the three US event.

Commanding General
Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sir:

In line with my efforts to determine the exact nature of an unidentified flying object seen in this area on Nov. 23, I have a number of questions prompted by a letter from Mr. Col. Lawrence J. Tacker, USAF Public Information Division, Office of Information, Washington, D. C.

I recently wrote Lt. Col. Tacker for an explanation of the sighting (see clipping, attached). in reply, he said that the original sighting in the mid-west on the morning of Nov. 23 was of Tiros II, just launched, and that later sightings were of instrumented balloons which had been released in conjunction with the satellite launching.

What were the circumstances of the passage of Tiros II over northern Ohio? When was it high, how fast was it going, how was it traveling?

Reports at the time referred to a single balloon launched from Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Where was this one at 0515 to 0530 a.m. Nov. 23? At what time and altitude did it achieve apparent visibility northeast of here? How large was it? The same were other balloons in this area at about the same time, where were they, how large, etc.?

The large number of reports from a wide area seemed to argue quite well on time and appearance. (That they were or single, conventional object which could be explained by a light, you can see on this matter will be sincerely appreciated.)
