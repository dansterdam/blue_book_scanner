AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

NAME: WILLIAM X. KNICKERBOCKER

DATE/TIME OF SIGHTING: 23 Nov 1960

LOCATION OF SIGHTING: Roselle and Marshall, Illinois

(1) Unidentified Flying Object Report
A report of an unidentified flying object was provided the Base Clearance Section of the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron on 23 November 1960. A witness reported that he observed a bright object in the sky at approximately 7:35 PM on 23 November 1960. The object appeared to be about 75-100 feet in diameter. No details of shape or color were reported. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes. No sound was heard. The object moved and hovered at various altitudes. At one point it was observed to ascend rapidly and then hover. All parties reported a bright object that first appeared in the east and maneuvered over their area, which is located near Roselle and Marshall, Illinois. The object was also to the east of Centralia, Illinois, as reported by Mr. [redacted].

The St. Louis Air Route Traffic Control Section indicated that they had no traffic in the area of the sightings at the time specified. The U.S. Weather Bureau was contacted, but they had no weather balloon activity in the area at the time of the sightings. The information has been recorded, but due to lack of specific details, i.e. shape, color, speed, etc., it is considered to be an insufficient report for analytical purposes according to JANAP 146. This information is being forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Defense Command, for any further action.

SUBJECT OF SEARCH: REPORT TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK
1. At about 2200 local on 6 Nov 60 the witness C.G., a plant guard employed at the ABC Screw Products Corp., saw what appeared to him to be a flying machine or object maneuvering silently in the air over the southern outskirts of Alliance, Ohio, the town where his plant is located. He said that a greenish light was visible at various points along the outline of the object. He ran to the northeast corner of the plant property and observed the object which appeared to be hovering in a stationary position.

2. At about 0230 on 7 Nov 60, C.G. called the Alliance Police Department and advised them of what he had observed and requested that they send a patrol car to the scene. The officer was dispatched and remained at the site for approximately 15 to 20 minutes during which time he also observed the object. The officer said that it maneuvered silently and that the greenish light was visible at various points around the perimeter of the object. He said that it remained stationary at one point and then moved off to the west at a rapid rate of speed, appearing to increase its altitude as it moved away. 

3. Since the occurrence, C.G. has called the Akron office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations to determine if a balloon or satellite could have been responsible for the sighting, but was informed that nothing was known to have been in the area at the time. He was advised that the investigation would be handled by Project Blue Book.

Transcription of the text in the document:

On 5-10-60 at approximately 10:00 PM CST, an unidentified flying object was sighted in the sky near Harrisville, Indiana. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. It was described as being round, about 30-35 feet in diameter, and was a bright yellowish-white in color. It appeared to be rotating and descended at a 15-20 degree angle. The object was reported to have made no sound. The observer, [REDACTED], reported that the object hovered for a few minutes and then rapidly increased in speed and elevation before disappearing from view. [REDACTED] stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control. Weather conditions at the time were clear and the visibility was good. No unusual meteorological or astronomical activity was reported for that date and location. The Air Force conducted an investigation but was unable to identify the nature of the object.

OUTPUT TEXT:

THE CONTROL AND LANDING PLACE WERE AS USUAL FOR PRIVATE PLANES. TAKE OFF TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 0900 HOURS. PILOT AND COPILOT STATED THAT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FLIGHTS. APPROXIMATELY 1015 HOURS WHILE CRUISING AT APPROXIMATELY 7000 FEET OVER THE MIDWESTERN U.S., THE FOLLOWING OBSERVED:

A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED ABOUT 10 MILES DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. IT SEEMED LARGER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT AND VERY BRIGHT. IT APPEARED AND THEN VANISHED QUICKLY. WHEN FIRST SIGHTED IT WAS ABOUT 1 O'CLOCK THE PLANE'S NOSE AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. IT FADED OUT SO RAPIDLY, THE PILOTS COULD NOT DETERMINE ITS EXACT MANNER OF DISAPPEARANCE. IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ERRATIC, MAKING SHARP TURNS AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ALTITUDES. THE PILOTS STATED THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY UNLIKE ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THEY HAVE EVER SEEN.

The image appears to show a typed letter from the Commanding General of the Air Technical Intelligence Center. The letter discusses a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Dayton, Ohio on December 8, 1960. The letter describes the circumstances of the sighting, including the size and altitude of the object, as well as the number of witnesses. However, there is no photograph included in this image.

Dec 8, 1960

Commanding General
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sir: 

In line with my efforts to determine the exact nature of a sighting in Dayton, Ohio on Dec. 8, 1960, I have a request. This incident was reported by a letter from Lt. Col. Tucker, for an explanation of this sighting.

The sighting (we still designate "uncertain") was a reply, he said, to a balloon launched and that later appeared to have landed. The time of the incident is reported as 6:30 p.m. The object had an apparent speed of about 200 mph, and an altitude of about 10,000 feet.

What were the circumstances of the passage of this "sighting" over Southwestern Ohio? When was it first observed, how long was it visible, what was its course, what was the weather, and what other witnesses were there?

Reports at the time referred to a single balloon launched at that location, but it is not clear whether this object in question was connected with that or not. Can you tell me more details about the object, its size, shape, color, duration of sighting, and any other pertinent information that can be obtained?

The large number of reports from a wide area around Dayton indicates your people will probably have additional data on this observation. Any information you can shed on this matter will be a valuable contribution.

"I never saw anything like it before." 
Earl Reid Jr., of Montville, one of those who reported the sighting to the Montville Co-op, who saw an unidentified flying object said that it was shaped like a saucer, seemed to be the size of a large plane, and was very bright. He explained that he didn't think was much about it until he got to work. Then, several fellow employees, including his foreman, D. B. Hanchett, watched the object as it maneuvered in the sky.
Mr. Rathburn, 48, of Painesville Township Rt. 5, said he saw the object at the same time. "The first time I noticed it, it seemed to be going up rapidly and flashed for about two seconds. It was blinking on and off and seemed to be changing to red."
"I watched it for about 15 seconds," Mr. Reid went on. "When I got to the stop light, the thing I looked at again, but it was gone."

The following describes information from Cape Farrell's report dated 25 Nov 59:

1700 hours, received a call from Sgt. Brock who stated, 3379th, that while on patrol near Bellingham he sighted a greenish-white round object, approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, that was very bright and seemed to have a dull hazy glow around it. The object shot straight up and then accelerated off to the south and disappeared in 2-3 seconds. Capt Farrell investigated the sighting and found Sgt. Brock to be a reliable observer. Brock stated that the object was around 1000 yards away and seemed to be around 500-600 feet in altitude. Brock had 15 minutes prior to this sighting seen another unidentified object in the same general area.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 8 Nov. 1960, at approximately 1815 hours, the reporting officer received a telephone call from an unidentified man who stated that he had observed an unusual aerial object northwest of Bellefontaine, Ohio, at approximately 1730 hours the same date.

2. The caller stated that he was driving north on State Route 117 when he observed a bright, shiny, metallic object hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet and approximately 5 miles distant. The object was described as round in shape, 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and surrounded by a red glow. The object remained hovering in the same general area for approximately 15 minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

3. The caller was unable to furnish any additional information concerning the object or its origin. He was reluctant to identify himself and would not permit the reporting officer to call him back for further information. 

4. The reporting officer contacted the Columbus Sector, Air Defense Command, to determine if any aircraft were operating in the area at the time of the reported sighting. The Columbus Sector advised that no aircraft were airborne in the area.

5. This incident is considered unresolved due to the lack of additional information concerning the object and its origin. The reporting officer was unable to obtain any additional information or evidence concerning this sighting.

SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS PART MIDWESTERN U S. IN NOVEMBER 1960
REPORTED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK
8 NOVEMBER 1960
1. On 8 November 1960, at approximately 1830 hours, a sight ing of an unidentified flying object occurred near Sioux City, Iowa.
2. The observer, a 29-year-old male, stated that he was driving west on Highway 20 approximately 7 miles east of Sioux City, when he observed a bright light which appeared to be about 200 yards above the ground. The light was described as being much brighter than any aircraft lights and having a pulsating or flashing effect. The object appeared to be circular in shape and remained stationary for several seconds.
3. The witness stated that he attempted to get closer to the object but it suddenly moved at a high rate of speed to the northwest and disappeared from view. The entire sighting lasted approximately 1 minute.
4. The witness was interviewed by an Air Force intelligence officer and was considered to be a reliable and credible observer. The weather at the time of the sighting was clear with good visibility.
5. No further information is available concerning this incident.

THE 1IND/41 ACLD / REPORT NAS CONTACTED DIY A SPECIAL AGENT OF THE DIVISION, FOLLOWED BY A TELEPHONE CALL TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTING WITNESS. OUR RESIDENT TECHNICAL ADVISOR HAS ALSO BEEN CONSULTED AND HIS VIEWS ARE INCORPORATED IN THIS SUMMARY.

LOCATION: MIDWESTERN - U. S. 
DATE: 8 NOVEMBER 1960
TIME: APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS (7:30 P. M. STANDARD)
WEATHER: CLEAR WITH A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS, WIND OUT OF THE NORTH AT 10 MPH. TEMPERATURE AROUND 50 F.

OBSERVER(S): ONE ADULT MALE, AGE 42, EMPLOYED AS A RADIO ENGINEER BY A MIDWESTERN ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING FIRM. DESCRIBED AS BEING OF INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE AND ARTICULATE IN SPEECH. NO OTHER OBSERVER(S).

OBJECT DESCRIPTION: CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT 60 FEET IN DIAMETER, GRAYISH-WHITE IN COLOR. OPAQUE, NOT TRANSPARENT. APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN TEXTURE. SURROUNDED BY A BLUISH GLOW OR HALO. NO EXTERNAL PROTUBERANCES OR DETAILS VISIBLE.

FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS: OBJECT OBSERVED HOVERING OVER A FIELD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN SECONDS. NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST VISIBLE.

SOUND: SILENT DURING ENTIRE OBSERVATION.

DURATION: APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 5 MINUTES.

INVESTIGATION: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BY OUR CONSULTANT INDICATES THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS MOST PROBABLY A WEATHER BALLOON OR SIMILAR TYPE DEVICE. HOWEVER, THE EXTREMELY RAPID VERTICAL ACCELERATION AND DISAPPEARANCE RULE OUT A CONVENTIONAL BALLOON. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE PRESENCE OF AN UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR SPACECRAFT. SIGHTING REPORT WAS DETAILED AND APPEARS CREDIBLE BASED ON THE OBSERVER'S DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND.

CONCLUSION: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. RECOMMEND NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME.

1. This headquarters has received a report from the Project Blue Book Headquarters, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Midwestern United States.  The report states that the object was observed on 14 October 1960 at approximately 2020 hours local time.
2. The object was observed by an Air Force officer while driving on a highway in the Midwest.  He describes the object as being pear-shaped, bright white in color, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  The object was observed for approximately two minutes.  It appeared to be hovering and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view in a northeasterly direction.
3. Since this sighting occurred in an area under your jurisdiction, I am requesting that your office undertake any investigation you feel is appropriate.  Additional information from Project Blue Book is available should you require it.
4. Please advise this office of the results of any investigation you may conduct.
