Dear Sir:

On December 14th at approximately
5:30, I saw a brilliant flash, "flames",
and sparks descending from a low
altitude to the ground. At that time,
I reported the incident to the West
York State Police. However since that
time, I have been in contact with
Dr. [redacted] of Wilton, Connecticut
who witnessed the same incident.

Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a clipping taken from the
Wilton Bulletin of December 19, 1962.

I thought it might be of interest to
you to know I also sighted the same object from
Wilton at 5:25 P.M. December 14th. falling in a
south easterly direction toward the town of
Weston, Connecticut.

Very truly,

Like a Comet:

Dr. Heller Sights Brilliant Object
Near Ridgefield-Wilton Border Dec. 14

A comet-like object, flashing sparks falling, it resembled a
across the sky near the Wilton- form somewhat both toward earth
Ridgefield town line was ob- and to the sky. It was seen by
served by Dr. John Heller of Dr. Heller as a relatively low
Glen Hill Road, Wilton, at altitude which was not clearly
5:25 p.m. Friday, Dec. 14, as not be guessed at since the
he was travelling south on Route was unknown, he said.
33 toward Wilton from his work Two Possibilities
at the New England Institute for Two possibilities are that (1)
Industrial Research. this was a meteor or significant

Proceeding west to east piece of a disintegrating satellite
on a flat projectory of 45 de- which was found embedded in
grees, the object's head was a the main street of a Mid-West-
brilliant blue-white. A cometary ern community. Such pieces of
tail followed it with many material are most important

scientifically. Because of their
protected exposure in outer
space they have been exposed
to a large amount of interplan-
etary matter, ranging from mi-
crometeorites to high-energy
cosmic rays and particles from
solar sources as well as electro-
magnetic radiation. The recov-
ery of such material if it struck
and embedded in the earth be-
fore being burned completely,
is quite important to scientists.

Dr. Heller guesses, in this case
that because of the presumptive
altitude, this chunk of material
was not destroyed completely.
If anyone sees an unusual
streak, or hole, or pieces of ma-
terial, it would be most helpful
to explore these to ascertain
their nature.

This observation has been re-
ported to the Pentagon Air
Force Command Post and is being fed into computers in order
to determine whether one of
the many orbiting scientific
boosters, whose trajectories are
constantly being tracked, may
be anticipated to have a trajectory bringing it down in this
area. If not, and if the object

seen was meteoric, its scientific
value would still be quite important, Dr. Heller said.

Dr. Heller is a member of the
Space Science Board of the
National Academy of Sciences
which serves as advisors to the
National Aeronautics and Space
Agency.
