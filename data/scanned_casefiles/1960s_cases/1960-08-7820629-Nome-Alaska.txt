ANCHORAGE, ALASKA 2 - ADDITIONAL DATA, THIS POLE (4) YEAR
RESIDENT, WHILE A PRIVATE CITY 2 PL.

JUST COLLECTED AND THERE WAS NO VHF TRAFFIC I.

THE MOST NIGHT TO THIS RECENT BROADCAST INDICATE THAT THE
INCIDENT CLEAR A DISTINCT AIRBORNE AT THIS TIME, WHICH BEARS A
GOOD POSSIBILITY. THIS OBSERVER SAID THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE AT
7, 8, OR HIGHER. TWO HOURS AFTER THIS REPORT, ALMOST TO THE
MINUTE, ANOTHER STATION (COLOMA ALASKA) REPORTED AN OBJECT VERY
SIMILAR WHICH MIGHT INDICATE A SATELLITE IN ORBIT APPEARING AT
CERTAIN INTERVALS OF TIME. THE OTHER SIGHTING IS ALSO BEING
FORWARDED.
