1ST ENDORSEMENT

1. Pursuant to a letter concerning this case of 25 January 1969 from one J. Smith (Correspondence File), the attached report of investigation - Mr. H. Boyle (Investigator) is forwarded for your information and review.

2. The report concerns a UFO sighting which occurred on 18 January 1969. The boys involved have been interviewed and their statements appear credible. We were not able to obtain physical evidence, but the boys have been consistent in their accounts.

3. I am forwarding this report to you for review and possible further investigation. I would have been glad to conduct a more comprehensive investigation, but time and resources are limited.

4. The report is attached.

H. H. FOWLER
Chairman, NICAP

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT

The boys apparently were out in the PM to the boys working on a tractor and observed by a hill and house. Described by a hill and house. Apparently they were working late that night and suddenly saw something which appeared to move with great speed and maneuverability, which was not like any conventional aircraft. The object was seen for several minutes.

There is a large black redaction/censorship mark at the top of the document. The rest of the document appears to be typed text, but the image quality is very low and the text is extremely faint and difficult to read. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor scan quality and low contrast. I cannot confidently reproduce any specific text from this page.

The text on the page is mostly illegible due to poor image quality. There are some hand-drawn sketches of what appear to be UFO or flying saucer-like objects. Some partial words and fragments can be seen, but not enough to confidently transcribe full sentences. The page seems to be part of a UFO report document with sketches and notes, but the specific details are not clear from this scan.

At the time of sighting, a jet from St. Margarets Air Force Base (Chatham, New Brunswick - at least I presume it was from there) was making and distant run in the far western sky-probably many miles from the object. This flying saucer disappeared in the direction towards the jet. One exciting event.

We were on a height of land overlooking Kennebecasis Bay, which is 2 miles wide. Hence the name of our village East Riverside. The river is so wide at this point the nautical maps refer to it as a Bay. East Riverside is 3 miles from the city of Saint John in the

For your information the largest Canadian armed forces base is at Gagetown, N.B. only 50 miles away. Surely somebody else has witnessed this sighting.

We have been experiencing an unusual January thaw with temperatures as high as 50° in the valley - nights are 15°. Usually in January their coasts of much rain - not so this year.

In 1967 we purchased the special "back magic" publication entitled "Flying Saucers" this form was in the back of that periodical. If you wish you might send this report to the proper Canadian authorities.

Hoping this report is of some importance.

MEMO FOR RECORD                                                7 Mar 69

SUBJECT:    Report of 3 Feb 69

On 3 Feb 69, Mr. [redacted] 1099 Lebanon Pike, Centerville, Ohio, telephone number [redacted] called to report that on Thursday night, 30 Jan 69, between 1930 and 2030 hours he heard a noise and his house shook. The next day his son found a hole by his garage that was about 1 ft. to 1 1/2 ft. in diameter, 8 ft. deep and almost straight down.

Mr. [redacted] thought the hole could have been produced by a meteorite.

He lives at the intersection of Route 48 and Webshaw Drive about 3 miles south of Centerville.

Lt. Varano notified Mr. [redacted] above and asked about possibility of satellite decay producing a hole 8 ft. deep. Mr. [redacted] in turn notified Lt. McGill.

At 1400 hours on 3 Feb 1969, Lt. Varano called Mr. [redacted] at the Smithsonian Observatory, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mr. [redacted] talked to Dr. McCrosky about the possibility of the hole being produced by a meteorite. Dr. McCrosky said it was possible but improbable.

Possibly only if the ground was "stiff and punchy". Mr. Clitron said that he would appreciate a piece if it was a meteorite. I said I could call him back next day. (Mr. Clitron suggested testing with a magnetometer, mine sweeper, etc. or even a magnet on a stick.)

Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Mr Citron:

1. On the evening of 30 January 1969, between 7:30 and 8:30 PM EST, the observer heard a loud noise similar to thunder or a sonic boom. The next day he found a hole in his back yard 16 about 11 inches in diameter and about 7 feet deep. This hole had not been there the day before. He contacted this office because he thought that the hole might have been caused by a meteor.

2. The observers name and address is; [redacted]

If you decide to contact the observer, please contact Lt Marano at this office also.

3. We would appreciate any comments you would care to make on the possibility of a meteorite causing this hole.

SUBJECT: Report of 3 Feb 69

Smithsonian received the photos but Dr. McCrosky is in Mexico picking up meteorites and won't be able to look at them for a while yet. The Mexican meteorite impacted at 0705 GMT 8 Feb 69. The Smithsonian has four scientists in the area and have recovered 7 pieces so far, 2 of which are over 12 kgm. Kirtland AFB had a B-57 dispatched within 12 hours to take samples of the meteor trail.

The text I can discern in this document is very limited:

In the top left corner of the first section, there appears to be some text, but it is too illegible to read clearly.

The bottom of the contour map section has some small text, but again, it is not clearly readable.

The image appears to be a series of technical diagrams or maps, including what looks like a topographical or contour map with curved lines, and some other charts or graphs with scattered numerical or alphabetical notations. However, the specific details are not clearly legible from this scanned image.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, 1969

The rest of the text appears to be part of a weather map or meteorological chart with various lines, contours, and markings indicating atmospheric conditions. The words "LOW" and "HIGH" are visible on the chart. However, as an OCR system, I can only transcribe the visible text, which in this case is limited to the date at the top of the page.


- page 87 -

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to contain several technical diagrams or charts with contour lines, curved lines, and scattered dot patterns. The diagrams seem to be scientific or meteorological in nature, with one section showing wavy contour lines and another showing a more scattered dot pattern.

There is no readable text on this page. The image contains three sections:

1. A top section with what appears to be a map or chart with curved lines and some markings
2. A middle section with contour lines forming a wavy, curved pattern

HIGH
LOW

BOTTOM LEFT:
LOW (multiple times)
HIGH

There is a small grid/legend area in the top left that appears to be partially illegible.

The image appears to contain multiple meteorological/weather charts with contour lines, pressure systems, and what seem to be weather data points. The charts include curved lines representing low and high pressure systems with various annotations.

FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1969

The rest of the text appears to be part of meteorological charts and maps showing weather patterns, with labels such as "LOW" and "HIGH" visible. The charts contain contour lines, numerical annotations, and various meteorological symbols. Due to the nature of the image, I cannot transcribe all the small numerical annotations, but the primary visible text is the date at the top of the page.


- page 109 -

The image appears to be a meteorological document with multiple weather maps/charts. The visible text on the image includes:

"LOW" (appears multiple times)
"HIGH" (appears in top right corner)

The image contains three main sections:
1. A top section with curved lines and meteorological markings
2. A middle section with contour/isobar-like lines and a central "LOW" marking
3. A right-side section with what appears to be a scattered numerical grid or map

No other legible text is visible in this document.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 25, 1969

The rest of the text appears to be part of a meteorological map with labels such as "LOW" and "HIGH", showing various contour lines and numerical annotations. However, as per the instructions, I will not interpret or describe the map itself beyond the visible text.


- page 111 -

The text in this image is mostly illegible. The document appears to contain several topographical or meteorological charts with contour lines and scattered numerical annotations. The word "MOT" can be seen in a couple of locations on the charts. There are some text fragments at the top and bottom of the page, but they are too blurry to read clearly.


- page 112 -

The image appears to be a technical diagram or chart with multiple curved lines, contour lines, and small dot-like markings scattered throughout. There are some numerical labels visible on the lines and around the diagram. At the bottom of the page, there is partially legible text that seems to read "SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1969" (though this is not completely clear). The diagram looks like it could be a meteorological, geological, or scientific mapping visualization, with complex interconnected curved lines and numerous small markers or data points.


- page 113 -

There is no readable text on this page. The image contains several technical diagrams and charts, including:

1. A top chart with curved lines and some small markings
2. A middle chart with contour or topographical lines forming a curved shape
3. A right side chart with scattered numerical or data points
4. A bottom right small chart or map-like diagram with scattered points

The diagrams appear to be meteorological, geological, or scientific in nature, but no specific text is legible.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JAN. 27-FEB. 2, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and in the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Publications Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. B.ilk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by chains of arrows, the locations of these centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours of the isotherms in the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24 hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest tenth of an inch are to the same period. Incomplete data are underlined. * indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

Here is the text from the document:

National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map. An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to Environmental

cations, Section, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

A portion of these are enclosed in the general analysis, in which the analyses are based. Occasional apparent discrepancies between the printed station data and the analyses result from those station reports that cannot be included in the published maps because of lack of space.

Height contours and isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are

plotted above the skeleton isotherms, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts are in inches to the nearest hundredth. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
