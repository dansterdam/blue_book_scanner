Dear Major:

I did not place any significance to the incident and to me it only appeared to be an airplane at some distance, say 6 or 5 miles when turned on his landing lights. And kept them on for 3- or 4 minutes, then turned them off.

I asked the radar operator if he had a target at my 9 or 10 o'clock position, he replied that he did not have, and I said "well there was one there alright."

I had no idea he was going to make a UFO report. I thought - nothing further of it. I presumed it was the difference refueling. They turn on lights for long periods of time when I have noticed that their respective operation when in progress.

I still think it was great run with his friendly lights on.
Respectfully,
Capt. [Redacted]

May 6, 1966

Dear Sirs:

This is an account of what transpired on the morning of May 4, 1966.

I was the radar controller at the Charleston, W.VA. Flight Activities Sector in the Intercept Air Route 1-79 A.C.

At approximately 3:40 A.M. a Baniff 543 called me on frequency and asked if I had any buffer for his flight at eight-thirty to nine-o'clock his position. I looked on the radar scope and saw a fast moving target to the left of Baniff 543 at the advised position. I advised that I do have a target and it was no known traffic. I told 543 to stand-by while I checked with my low-altitude sector to see if they had anyone. He advised that will not be necessary because the object was above him and descending at about a twenty degree angle.

Baniff 543 was at 33,000 ft.

Baniff 543 called again and stated the object was not an aircraft, was fast moving and very bright and was now in a sharp left turn.

At this time I was cleared the target turning at a high rate of speed.

Convairs 90 then came on the frequency and asked Breuiff 543 if he had his landing lights on. 543 advised that he did not. Convairs 90 was twenty miles behind Breuiff and at 37,000 ft. (I assume Convairs 90 also had this bright object in sight.)

For confirmation I asked Breuiff 543 if the object was just moving and never quite got to his new sector position. Breuiff 543 replied in the affirmative and stated that the object didn't look like an aircraft and was very bright in color.

I would estimate the object was traveling at about 750 to 800 miles an hour. The object was parallel to the Breuiff for about ten miles and then made a turn at about 110 degrees to the left. The target faded about five miles after rolling out of the turn.

Breuiff 543 was later asked by Washington Center by Memphis Center request what color the object was. Breuiff said it was a brilliant white changing to blue.

Sincerely,

Note: Diagrams enclosed.
