I feel my report was not given very carefully to the incident, and it was not fully up to the case as possible. Considering unusual weather conditions, I failed short which is the real facts of the matter. I discussed the problem of me to those people who were present, where I turned these opinions for guidance. I requested the details of which I was uncertain, and I still an there was nothing very definitely, which I could not ascertain or confirm. I fell the matter of the personal explanation I gave before reporting I was making any mistake of what I saw. Further than regarding what I purported to have seen, I personaly as I did not wish to spend any time drawing unnecessary comparisons or analyzing my own recollections in too great detail.

Dear Sirs:
This is an account of what transpired on the morning of May 4, 1966.
I was the radar observer at the Charleston-Kanawha County Airport on that date.
At approximately 9:45 a.m. a Beechcraft 95 aircraft, flight 543, called the tower requesting clearance to land. Pilot at sight - thirty to nine - weather his position.
I checked on the radar scope and saw a fast moving target to the southeast of the airport, traveling at an estimated speed of 500 m.p.h. This target had approached to within 8-10 miles of the airport.
I told 543 to standby while I checked with my controllerrrrr. He stated that there were no other aircraft in the area.
The target continued to close in at a steady rate and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 25,000 ft. Beechcraft 543 was at 8,500 ft.
Beechcraft 543 landed without incident.
The target made a tight left turn and disappeared from the radar scope.
I told my controller and the civil defense director about the UFO sighting. They were both extremely surprised and concerned.
