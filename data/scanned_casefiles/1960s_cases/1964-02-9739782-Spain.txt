of red, green or white lights, steady or
blinking. Motion includes following a/c
and horizontal motion, astern to right or left
and/or changing altitudes.

Insufficient data for analysis, however
all objects have been in West (eastern or
a/c on flights to East) and are reported
as lights. No configurations noted and
no mention of disappearance. Very likely
objects under observation are the planets
Venus or Jupiter.

On the 14 February to 13 March cases in Spain - can be get
more information or is this completely dead by now? Very likely these were Venus
and Jupiter, but I total like to see the last one of the original reports.
