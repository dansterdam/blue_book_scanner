Dear Mr. [redacted]:

The photographs you forwarded have been examined by photographic analysts in our laboratories. Who say the most probable cause for the spots was defects in or on the negatives. Without a complete examination of the negatives from which these prints were obtained, it is impossible to arrive at a more complete analysis.

Sincerely,
