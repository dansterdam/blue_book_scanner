DISTRICT OFFICE
1st Lt. St.
Cleveland, Ohio     Ref: Reporting of Controlled Observation
                    of U.F.O.'s

Gentlemen,

The following data may be of some interest to the Air Force Defense Command not so much from another sighting but the kind of sighting.

I wish to report a craft maneuvering last night at 8:10 P.M. 
B.S.T. from my small farm at [location redacted], Town, Ohio.

When over: appeared a half minute after a high flying jet plane(
looked F. Wright and sound to be an intercept air force plane
flying west about 45,000 ft. altitude and just under base ground
barrier perhaps about 700 A.S.L. was observed by this writer.

Judged altitude of air craft 150,000 to 200,000 ft. altitude
bearing S. 30 deg. W. and on vertical angle 70 deg. which
again was about 4 to 5 seconds. Noted craft lasting
1/2 second. Later in study the altitude, time of flight,
and speed of display calculations came out to 15 m.p.s. second or
750 m.p. minute of 45,000 P.

The most valuable part of the sighting was that this craft flew
in a very particular flight pattern. This same as an artificial world (?) 16V. Is same form is a vertical dive climbing
in a loop-over-over towards spiral and then maneuvered into an
inverted loop. With an additional to two altitude levels.
Each level appearing to be about 15,000 feet altitude. It slowed
from near to almost a power of 45,000 at the various stages
of descent and ascent and level change and the craft exited a
different type of output of low frequency which is 15 or on
UFO's or can read about it in last 15 years. The light was a
clear silvery white cool type of light emission changing only in
intensity but not in COLOR.

If interested in further details and description please contact
writer at Dale & Millgren Engineers 613 E. Tallmadge Ave.
Akron, Ohio RT 7161.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
