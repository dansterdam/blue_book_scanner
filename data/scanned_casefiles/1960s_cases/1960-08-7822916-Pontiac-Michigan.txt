Remarks: Possible correlation w/ Echo I
Satellite. Mrs. [redacted] was fishing at Green
Green Lake, near Pontiac, Mich., when she
observed this UFO. This sighting was originally telephoned to higher Hq (30 ADLv)
and later it was discovered that format reporting procedures had not been followed,
resulting in this delay.

Rather involved reporting sequence makes
back-tracking to source difficult, however,
if more information is desired, every effort
will be made to contact her.
