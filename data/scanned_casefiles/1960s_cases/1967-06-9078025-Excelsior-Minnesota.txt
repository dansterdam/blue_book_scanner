SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
Witness: NAME REDACTED

At approximately 6:00 AM on 9 June 1967, the witness observed a bright light in the sky southeast of his location near Excelsior, Minnesota. The object was estimated to be 1/2 mile in diameter and approximately 500 feet above the ground. The witness observed the object for approximately 10 minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The witness reported this sighting to the local police department. No other witnesses are known at this time. This sighting has been documented as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects.

TRANSCRIPT:

This is a collection of witness statements regarding a reported Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) incident that occurred in Excelsior, Minnesota on June 9, 1967. The report contains the following text:

"On June 9, 1967, at approximately 1845 hours, Mr. T.L. Wallis of Excelsior, Minnesota, called the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and reported observing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being spherical in shape, silvery in color, and hovering about 50 feet above the ground. The object was observed for about 10 minutes.

Mr. T.L. Wallis stated that the object moved erratically, at times seeming to "jiggle" in the sky. It then shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. Mr. Wallis was unable to provide any additional details regarding the size or exact location of the object.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office notified the U.S. Air Force and provided a report of the incident. No further information is available regarding any follow-up investigation or analysis conducted by the U.S. Air Force."
