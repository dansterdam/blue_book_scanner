27 February 1960

Subject: Advanced Report of UFO's

1. At approximately 2000, I received two calls from the Headquarters USAF Command Post with the following information:

a. A UFO was sighted at 8320 Z south of Loring AFB by the Tower and other personnel. It probably had a long rail and moved from 3500 to 1700°. One aircraft reported it might have been a celestial body.

b. The above information was relayed through Major Bragg, 8th AF on via Maj r Edge, SAC CP.

c. According to Col. Richardson, Boling AFB, Wallops Island launched a balloon today which coincided in time and possibly in appearance with the UFO.

2. Loring will probably follow up with a UFO report.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Cornwall, Vermont

Date: 27 February 1960   Hour (?) 2323

WX 7/10 cloud cover, ceil 4500', vis 30 wt. Winds NW 6 x wt 12 to 75 knots

Description: Round, size of pinhead, silver or reflected light, tail 5-7 deg of arc, red at head of tail fading to pale yellow at end, first seen 170 deg 30 deg elev. disappear 140 deg 15 deg elev. appeared to be descending and/or moving away to the east, seen for 11 minutes

Direction of Motion: East

Satellite: (AGOIN-4F3, Phone 69219) - Ruled out-none known to be moving East of West around the Earth

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Duration excessive for a meteor - moved too fast for a star or planet

Radar Analysis (AGOIN-421): None

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): Ruled out

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Possible Aircraft - Ruled out - Unknown (Meteor) Electric Power

Other: Possible Unknown Due to the Involved Presence

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Possibly Good

Analysis and Conclusions: The description of this object fits that of a jet aircraft with the operation of a fighter, cause of which is known to be at the area where the scientific occurred... It is most probable that all witnesses were victims of an illusion caused by a distant aircraft source being misinterpreted into something unusual.
