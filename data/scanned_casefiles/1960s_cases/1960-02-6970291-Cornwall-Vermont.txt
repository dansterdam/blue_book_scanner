The text in the document is as follows:

27 February 1960

Subject: Advanced Report of UFO's

1. At approximately 2000, I received two calls from the Headquarters USAF Command Post with the following information:

a. A UFO was sighted at 2330 Z south of Essex, Vermont by the Tower and other personnel. It reportedly had a long red tail and moved from 3500 to 1000 feet. One aircraft reported it might have been a celestial body.

b. The above information was relayed through Major Wright, 6th AP on via TWX.

c. According to Col. Richardson, Bolling AFB, Wallops Island launched a balloon today which coincided in time and possibly in appearance with the UFO.  

2. Loring will probably follow up with a UFO report.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Cornwall, Vermont
Date: 27 February 1960    Hour (Z): 2232
Weather: 710 wind speed, 4500' - 15.90 m/s wind, F 4.3 F as to 4.75 temp
Description: Round white luminous ball size of baseball, size of grapefruit, with a 270 degree arc of red or pink light on bottom half. Ball descended straight down, stopped, then disappeared.
Direction of Motion: East
Satellite: (ARGUS-D39): USNSH 69239 - Motion seen to the west
Astronomical Phenomena (Moon, Comet, Planet, etc): Unsuitable for a natural explanation
Radar Analysis (ARGUS-D39): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): Ruled out
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Positive exclusion
Other: Caused intense interest in observer, more to consider than just UFO. The duration of the sighting was approximately 2-3 minutes.
Analysis and Conclusions: The inaccuracy of witness with regard to statements and lack of support for natural causes suggest that unidentified aerial phenomenon was observed. No known object or natural explanation can be determined to explain this sighting.
