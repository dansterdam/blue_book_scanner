11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a white colored object that appeared to twinkle like a star as it traveled toward the southern part of the sky. The flight path was straight and level. Just before the object disappeared it appeared to slow somewhat and appeared to bobble. All of a sudden the white light disappeared.

The description is consistent with that of a satellite observation. Echo II was in the area being over 101W at approximately 0224V 17 Jan 67.
