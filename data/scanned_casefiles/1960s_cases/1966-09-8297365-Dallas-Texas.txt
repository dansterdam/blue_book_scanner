EYE WITNESS REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING
At Dallas, Texas, September 24, 1966

"I saw a 'saucer-like' P. G. above my home in the Pleasant Grove area in the southeastern part of Dallas, Wednesday night, September 23, 1966, beginning at 11:55 P.M. I was not sleepy so I got out of bed to watch. I was in the kitchen. I glanced out the window and a bright light caught my eye. I ran out-side. In my haste I noticed the 'craft' was about 1/2 mile away. At the moment I could see there were four or five lights grouped together and the perimeter of the circumference had these other bright lights about equal to it. The revolving of the lights were 'no pattern'. On the top of the disc was a red dome barely visible. It was at static over my house moving southward with a slight motion. I saw it very clearly and it seemed at the lowest 15 or 20 feet above ground when I first spotted it. It definitely was not an airplane, balloon, helicopter, or weather phenomenon. It was a 'craft' of some kind. I could see a metallic surface. I was about 300 to 400 feet above the ground when I saw it over my house. It was so distinct that I could turn in a banking turn toward the west and southwest of Dallas. It went almost out of my vision as it was turning. I watched it with my wife. We both called my mother, calling to my wife 'Come quick, watch it with me from the front yard'. It had maneuvered here with its loud humming sound as it passed over my house. It seemed to make a wide turn as a gyrator will make. It both wobbled and directly went over Dallas downtown area, and I was making an 'oh boy' watching it. The object and about halfway back to my house made a direct line. It was so distinct and about half way back to my house it hovered it for about ten or fifteen minutes and my wife watched it with me for about half an hour. All of the lights except the dome were white. The moon was almost full and there were no clouds in the sky. It was a beautiful night."
