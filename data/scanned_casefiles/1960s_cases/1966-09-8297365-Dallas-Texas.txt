The text in the document reads:

THE WITNESS WAS SITTING ON THE PORCH OF HIS HOME AT DALLAS, TEXAS, SEPTEMBER 3, 1966.

AT ABOUT 11:20 P.M. HE SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY MOVING TOWARD HIM FROM THE EAST. HE SAID THE LIGHT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL, STEADY AND BRIGHT WITH NO BLINKING. IT MOVED SILENTLY AT A FAIRLY FAST SPEED AND APPEARED TO BE AT ABOUT 1000 TO 1500 FEET ALTITUDE. AS IT CAME CLOSER, HE COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE AND HAD LIGHTS OR WINDOWS AROUND THE RIM. WHEN IT WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, IT STOPPED SUDDENLY AND HOVERED FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES. THEN IT MOVED OFF TO THE NORTHEAST AT A VERY HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. ALL OF THE NEIGHBORS WERE SITTING ON THEIR PORCHES BUT ONLY THE WITNESS SAW THE OBJECT. THE WITNESS IS A COLLEGE GRADUATE AND A RESPECTED MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE SAW BUT IS INSISTENT THAT IT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR ANYTHING HE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE.
