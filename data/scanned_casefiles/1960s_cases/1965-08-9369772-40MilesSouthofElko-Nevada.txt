Salt Lake City Center would have a good idea as to our position, AS we were on a Radar vector (Question #4)

United Airlines flight 413C was about 40 mi. south of us and Reported it first to Salt Lake Center. Our heading was 50°, altitude 33000', the object appeared at 1130 o'clock position and moved to out 11 to 1130 o'clock position when we lost sight of the light. It did not reappear. plane - didn't seem to gain or less altitude.

It has been almost a month since sighting it - believe that if all air traffic control centers, or the pilots themselves were to have these forms on hand a lot more accurate report could be given.
