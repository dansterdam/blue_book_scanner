10. CONCLUSION
Other (REFLECTION)
Photo analysis explains the objects on the photo as being caused
by reflection and a double image as natural to a reflection through
the windshield. Visalia report consistent with this analysis.

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Two

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
2 Minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Hazy day. Objects brighter than stars. Sharply outlined.
Object appeared to be vapor trail. All of a sudden it stopped
and was no longer visible. Photo taken. Night to left in front
of observer.
Submitted to photo analysts. Double image identical.
Explanation can arise where reflection and double image could be
Object can be attributed to reflection and the double image
explained by reflection through the windshield.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT    NR 65-41    PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES    DATE OF REPORT 13 Sep 1965

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: BURBANK, CALIFORNIA    DATE: 17 JULY 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY
AV ________________ IR ________________ QUALITY: GOOD
PHOTO: NEG. (FILMSTRIP FRAME)

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-98 from Major L. Quintanilla Jr. (UFOB/MF) to analyze one negative (filmstrip frame) taken at Burbank, California on 17 July, 1965.

2. ANALYSIS: Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] (UFOB) assisted in the analysis of the negative.

a. The negative contains two unidentified images which are in close proximity to each other. The light intensities of these objects are much greater than the sky background. The density of these objects is approximately 10 times greater than the sky.

The clearer reported in FIR Form 164, haze at the time of photography. Assuming a haze condition, it is unlikely that the unidentified objects would be as sharp as they are when the photograph was taken from inside an automobile, through the haze, of objects in the sky. This tends to indicate that the objects were not airborne at the time of photography. The two unidentified objects are parallel and appear to be identical, although slightly separated.

3. CONCLUSION: The two unidentified objects are probably a double image of the sun being reflected off some object in front of the windshield, possibly the tip of a wiper blade, onto the windshield. The identical double image could be caused by a reflection from the front and rear of the windshield glass.

Dear Mr [redacted]:

The negative which you submitted to the Air Force for analysis is returned.

The double image in the print could be caused by a reflection from the front and rear of the windshield glass. This reflection also accounts for the appearance and disappearance of the object as reported. A copy of the photo analysis report is attached for your information.

Thank you for submitting your report to the Air Force.
