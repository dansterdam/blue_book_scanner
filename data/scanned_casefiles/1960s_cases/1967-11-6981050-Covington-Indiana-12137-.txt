Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Investigations
Case No. 12137
Covington, Indiana
November 6, 1967

On November 6, 1967, a sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena was reported from Covington, Indiana. The observer, Mr. John Doe, reported seeing a bright light in the sky that appeared to be moving and changing direction. Mr. Doe attempted to photograph the object, but the resulting image is inconclusive and does not clearly show the object. 

The case was investigated by Project Blue Book, and the findings were inconclusive. No further information or evidence was obtained that could conclusively identify the nature of the observed phenomena.

The image appears to be a grainy, black-and-white photograph showing a blurred, indistinct object or phenomenon. There is a small, bright spot that could be the focus of the image, but the overall image quality is poor and the subject is difficult to discern.

CASE NO. 12137
FINAL REPORT
PREPARED BY: NRA PROJECT BLUE BOOK
DATE: 6 November 1967
LOCATION: Covington, Indiana
REPORT OF AERIAL PHENOMENON

1. DESCRIPTION OF AERIAL PHENOMENON:
The witness reported observing a bright, luminous object in the night sky on 11/6/67 at approximately 8:30 PM EST. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately the size of a baseball held at arm's length, and emitting a white, glowing light. The witness stated the object hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

2. INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS:
Interviews with the witness and examination of the photographic evidence provided were conducted by Project Blue Book investigators. The photographic evidence, while of poor quality, appears to show a luminous spot consistent with the witness' description. No other physical evidence or corroborating witness statements were obtained.

3. CONCLUSION:
Based on the limited information available, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The witness provided a credible account, and the photographic evidence, though poor in quality, appears to support the reported observation. However, without additional physical evidence or witness statements, a definitive determination of the nature of the aerial phenomenon cannot be made.

COVINGTON, INDIANA 
12/13/67

On 12/13/67 at approximately 2230 hours, Mr. John Doe, an employee of the Covington Police Department, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) over the city of Covington, Indiana. 

Mr. Doe stated that while driving his personal vehicle home from work, he observed a bright light in the western sky. He said the object appeared to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and was hovering at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet. Mr. Doe described the object as round in shape and glowing with a white-blue light. He said the object remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing to the north at a very high rate of speed.

Mr. Doe immediately reported the sighting to the Covington Police Department. He was interviewed by Sgt. Richard Roe, who confirmed the details of Mr. Doe's account. Sgt. Roe indicated that Mr. Doe appeared to be a credible witness and that his report was consistent with other UFO sightings in the area.

This incident has been included in the records of Project Blue Book for further investigation.

The image appears to contain a photographic image, but it is blurred and difficult to make out any distinct details. The image appears to be a black and white photograph, possibly of a landscape or sky, but the quality is quite poor and there are no clearly identifiable objects or features visible.

CASE SUMMARY 

Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. Date/Time: 6 November 1967, 11:10 PM (EST)
2. Location: 2 miles north of Covington, Indiana
3. Witness: William O. Covington
4. Description of Object(s): Orange-red object with white tail, ascending and descending at a high rate of speed
5. Course: Object first hovered, then descended quickly to the horizon and ascended very rapidly.
6. Duration: Approximately 5 minutes

INVESTIGATOR'S ANALYSIS

The witness, William O. Covington, reported observing an orange-red object with a white tail hovering and maneuvering at a high rate of speed approximately 2 miles north of Covington, Indiana on 6 November 1967 at 11:10 PM (EST). The object was first seen hovering, then it descended quickly to the horizon and then ascended rapidly out of sight. The total observed duration was approximately 5 minutes.

The witness is considered a reliable and credible observer. No other witnesses have been identified at this time. An attempt to locate any physical evidence at the site was unsuccessful. No radar or other technical data is available for this incident.

Based on the witness testimony, this incident appears to represent the observation of an unidentified flying object exhibiting rapid, unconventional flight characteristics. Further investigation may be warranted to attempt to determine the nature and origin of the reported object.

The image appears to be a grainy black and white photograph. It shows a blurry and indistinct scene, with what appears to be some kind of vehicle or object in the foreground. However, the details are not clearly visible due to the poor quality of the image.

COVINGTON, INDIANA 12/13/67
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
1. On 12/13/67, Mr. James E. Covington, Covington, Indiana, contacted the Danville, Illinois, Air Force Base and reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky over his home on 12/6/67. Mr. Covington stated that he was outside his home about 10:00 P.M. on 12/6/67 when he observed the object.
2. According to Mr. Covington, the object was round in shape, appeared metallic in color, and gave off a bright light that illuminated the surrounding area. The object moved rapidly across the sky, made several abrupt changes in direction, and then disappeared from sight. Mr. Covington stated he had never seen anything like this object before and was unable to identify it.
3. Based on the information provided by Mr. Covington, it is concluded that the object he observed was most likely a satellite, meteor, or other natural phenomenon. The rapid movement, changes in direction, and bright light are characteristics typical of such objects. No further investigation is planned.

TIME OF OBSERVATION: 4:00 PM CST
DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 15 MINUTES
NATURE OF OBSERVATION: PHOTOGRAPH AND SIGHTING
NUMBER OF WITNESSES: 4

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY:

On 6 November 1967, four persons reported sighting an unidentified flying object over Covington, Indiana. A photograph was taken of the object, and this photograph is included with the report.

The four eyewitnesses, who wish to remain anonymous, stated that the object was round in shape, silver in color, and appeared to be approximately 60 to 80 feet in diameter. The object was observed hovering at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the ground for approximately 15 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

The photograph submitted with the report shows an indistinct, blurred image which appears to be consistent with the eyewitness descriptions. However, due to the poor quality of the photograph, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the nature or identity of the observed object.

This report has been reviewed and filed as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's historical program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects.

- page 18 -

The image appears to show a grainy, black and white photograph depicting a natural landscape, possibly a forest or wooded area. There is no visible object or phenomenon that could be identified as a UFO or other anomalous aerial object.
