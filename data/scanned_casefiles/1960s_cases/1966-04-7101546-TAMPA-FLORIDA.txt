     Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2, the following information regarding
reported UFO's is submitted.

2. Three different UFO's were sighted on three different occasions
by Mr. [redacted] in Tampa, Florida.

a. First sighting.
   (1) Six (6) objects approximately the length of four (4) head-
   lights were sighted by the observer on 7 Feb 1966 at 1250Z while walking
   her dog in the back yard.

   (2) The color of the objects was chrome or silver.

   (3) There were no discernable features or details.

   (4) The objects made no sound.

   (5) The observer said objects were moving in a westward direction.

   (6) The objects were hovering (approximately) 50 feet above the
   ground 300-500 feet from the observer. They remained motionless, hovering
   above the ground for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The objects then
   headed west and disappeared over the horizon.

   (7) The manner of observation was ground-visual without the use
   of optical aids.

b. Second sighting.
   (1) Object was the size and shape of a Volkswagen car, and was
   covered with lights about the size of a "coffee can top".

   (2) Object was sighted by observer outside her residence while
   walking her dog. The sighting occurred approximately 0200Z on 11 Apr 1966.

   (3) Object appeared to be made of glass, but the observer was
   unsure of this feature.

   (4) Object appeared over treetops heading in a southerly direction.

Here is the text from the document:

(5) Observer stated that the object was brightly lit and moved in a "wavering" motion.

(6) Object disappeared over the horizon.

(7) Prior to sighting the object, the observer said a plane had flown past just seconds before the object appeared.

(8) The object made no sound as it passed 30 - 40 feet above the observer.

(9) The object remained in view for approximately 5 minutes.

c. Third sighting.

(1) Observer sighted 12 four-pointed objects 6-12 inches in diameter.

(2) Objects looked like small, white swirling clouds with lights.

(3) The objects were seen by the observer while walking her dog at approximately 0200 - 0230 on 14 Apr 1966.

(4) The objects appeared in a straight line over the treetops heading in a westerly direction. After passing, 6 objects headed south and the remaining 6 objects continued up the street in a westerly direction and disappeared.

(5) The objects made no sound.

(6) The observation was ground-visual without the use of optical aids.

(7) There were no other discernable features or details given.

d. The observer was [redacted], Sr., age 62, a widow, of Tampa, Florida.

e. The weather for the 3 sightings was clear; visibility unlimited except for small cloud cover on 7 February 1966.

f. No other activity or unusual condition which may account for these sightings is to have existed at this time. There were no other reports from other individuals in this area concerning these objects.

g. No interception or identification action was taken.

h. There is no existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs available.

1. Mrs. [redacted] appeared rational at the time of the interview. She is far sighted and has difficulty seeing. It is believed she could have imagined these objects or possibly saw something she thought appeared as she described. It seems unusual that no other person from the same area (which is densely populated) observed these phenomena as did Mrs. [redacted] since they have occurred quite regularly in the past 3 months. Also, all 3 sightings occurred in the same area (the observer's backyard) but were different objects each time and of different numbers.

3. Mrs. [redacted] has made other UFO sightings while living in Michigan during 1957-1959. During this period she sighted 3 UFOs.

4. It is believed that due to Mrs. [redacted] age, her poor eyesight and living alone, she probably imagined the UFOs or that she could have seen something of logical explanation that her poor eyesight misinterpreted.

(4) The object was on a steady course - heading SSE.

c. The manner of observation was ground-visual without the use of optical aids.

d. The time and date of the sighting were 0900Z, 17 April 1966. It was dark (just before dawn) and clear with no cloud cover.

e. The location of the sighting was made from a swampy area near route 41 - 11 miles E of Tampa. The observer and three other persons were catching frogs in the area at the time of the sighting.

f. The observer was a salesman in Tampa. Observer was national and information source can be considered reliable.

g. The weather was clear; visibility unlimited; there was no cloud cover.

h. No other activity or unusual condition which may account for this sighting is known to have existed at this time.

i. No interception or identification action was taken.

j. There is no existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs available.

k. It is believed the object sighted could have been a high-flying aircraft or satellite. Sunrise was at 1032Z and the object was sighted around 0900Z. A high-flying object could have picked up and reflected the sun's rays even though the sun was below the observer's horizon. The observer did not seem too concerned about the sighting (he did not watch it until it disappeared). He said he thought it was probably a satellite.
