ON October 4 at Cressy, Launceston, Australia Reverend and Mrs. [redacted] reported sighting a grey, cigar-shaped object with a dull surface, which came down through a cloud cover, headed north at about 400 feet off the ground. Then out of the clouds above and behind the ship, they saw five or six small disc-shaped objects, which traveled fast. Their movement was compared to "flat stones skipping along the water."

OCT. 4, 1960 CESSY, LAUNCETON, AUSTRALIA (LORENZO P 214)       2 WITNESSES     01

DURING THE EVENING OF OCTOBER 4, 1960 AN OBSERVATION AT CESSY CAUSED    01

CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE AUSTRALIA NEWSPAPERS. AT 6:10 P.M. MINUTES 02

AFTER CESSY RESIDENTS REPORTED A MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION, THE REVEREND AND  03

MRS. [REDACTED] BROWNING SPOTTED A GRAY, CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT WHILE LOOKING THROUGH 05

THE RECTORY WINDOW AT A RAINBOW IN THE EAST. MRS. [REDACTED] SAW THE OBJECT   05

FIRST AND POINTED IT OUT TO HER HUSBAND. THERE WERE FOUR VERTICAL BANDS ALONG   06

THE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, AND AT THE BOW END A ROD WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A    07

SMALL PROPELLER AT THE END JUTTED OUT. THE WIND WAS LOUD AND NO SOUND WAS      08

HEARD ABOVE IT. THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED BY THE REVEREND           09

AT ABOUT 500 M.P.H., AND IT TRAVELED IN A STRAIGHT PATH TOWARD WESTERNIA        10

JUNCTION. AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE OF STEADY MOVEMENT THE OBJECT STOPPED IN         11

MIDAIR, HOVERING OVER THE PANSHANGER ESTATE, ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY. THE        12

[REDACTED] WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN WERE    13

SURPRISED TO SEE FIVE OR SIX SMALL DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS APPEAR OUT OF THE         14

CLOUDS ABOVE AND BEHIND THE LARGER OBJECT. THE DISCS WERE TRAVELING VERY FAST   15

AND THE [REDACTED] COMPARED THEIR MOVEMENT TO "FLAT STONES SKIPPING ALONG THE    16

WATER." THE SMALL OBJECTS STATIONED THEMSELVES BESIDE THE LARGER OBJECT         17

WITHIN A HALF-MILE RADIUS. THE MINISTER SAID THEY WERE ABOUT THIRTY FEET IN     18

DIAMETER, BUT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF HIS ESTIMATE. RATHER SEVERAL SECONDS       19

LATER, THE REVEREND [REDACTED] REPORTED THE LARGE OBJECT, ACCOMPANIED BY THE SMALLER 20

OBJECTS, RETURNED TO THE WAY HAD COME. THE LARGE OBJECT, HE SAID, DID NOT       21

MANEUVER TO RETURN INTO THE RAIN CLOUD. THE ROD END WAS THE LAST PART OF THE    22

OBJECT TO ENTER THE RAIN CLOUD. THE OBJECT RETURNED TO THE CLOUD FASTER THAN     23

IT HAD EMERGED, AND WAS GONE FROM SIGHT WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS. BROWNING SAID    24

HE BELIEVED THE LARGE OBJECT WAS GOING TOWARD WESTERN JUNCTION UNDER COVER OF   25

HEAVY RAIN, AND, AS IT APPEARS, THE OBJECT SAILED ON FOR SOME SKY AND UNAWARE WATER 26

IT HAD ALSO ITS PROTECTION.                                                      27

A sighting which occurred in Anaheim, California, on October 14th
was unique in one aspect. Two strikingly similar objects were seen
in the same area. The first was sighted by a woman near her home.
Later, another was seen by a man. Eventually the fact was checked
and verified in detail. The two way and discrepancy...
