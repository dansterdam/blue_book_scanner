The Warminster Phenomena

The town of Warminster, England, is a small town in the West Country. It has about 11,000 population, and is in the vicinity of several large defense and/or military installations. Since Christmas Day, 1964, there have been strange "going-on" in that town, and at first glance it would seem that UFOs are involved in some, if not all of these aerial mysteries.

Arthur Shuttlewood, variously described as an editor and reporter, listed some of the occurrences, although his coverage was far from detailed. To wit:

At 6:15 a.m. on Christmas Day, Mrs. Madge Bye, 36-year-old mother of three, was walking to early morning service at Christ Church when she became aware of a "weird crackling" above her head, "accompanied by a high-pitched whine."

Suddenly, and quite inexplicably, Mrs. Bye was hurled against the churchyard wall, "pinned there as if by invisible hands of sound," she said. She saw nothing but felt "sickening blows raining on my head and shoulders", and the nape of her neck felt "deathly cold as though gripped in an icy hand." She fell to the ground in shock, screaming for help, and finally others heard her and rushed out.

At exactly the same time that Mrs. Bye first heard "the thing" (dubious by Shuttlewood), Head Postmaster Roger Rump and his wife were awakened in their home nearby by a ferocious battering on their roof. Rump said, "The ceiling shook. It was just as though 5,000 tiles on our roof were being rattled and rocked off by some terrific force." Then a frantic scrambling sound as if the tiles were being hurriedly replaced. "What impressed Mr. and Mrs. Rump throughout the experience was the fact that there was a "queer rapping or crackling, a strange droning tone behind it." The noises lasted a total of only about a minute.

Three minutes prior to the experience of the Rumps and Mrs. Bye, a young couple, who requested anonymity, were wakened by the barking and whimpering of their dog outside in the garden. This at 6:12 a.m., according to their clock. They sent their daughter Josie out to see what was wrong with the dog, and, hurrying to the garden in her robe, the 9-year-old found the animal covering in a corner of a woodshed, whimpering. Seeing nothing wrong, Josie petted him, spoke to him and started back into the house via the back door.

Warminster...
(Continued from page 7)

this instance and other strange reports, including the finding of numerous dormice, dead with their bodies riddled with tiny holes, he says, "There can be only one explanation which is at all feasible. All the evidence points that way. This is neither natural or supernatural. It is extraterrestrial, I assure you."

The most recent happening, during 1965, some of which were important and sensational enough to warrant international press-wire coverage, took place between July and September, 1965. On the night of July 7, five people spotted a "fiery object" glowing in the southern sky after a heavy rain. Mr. and Mrs. Harold Horlock were among the witnesses. Mrs. Horlock said it was frightening, that it was hazy at first, then seemed to be climbing and sharply into focus as it climbed. Then it appeared as two red hot pokers horizontally oriented, one above the other. "It was a plain and as bright as could be," Mr. Horlock told the press, "it stopped still in the sky for at least 10 minutes." Colin Hampton, 18, and his friend Michael Fraser, 20, also reported viewing the object. Others reported hearing loud pitched noises overhead.

The most recent manifestation of the thing or things troubling Warminster took place at 1:55 a. m. on Tuesday, September 7, when more than a hundred people claimed they were awakened suddenly by what they described as a "tremendous explosion." About 30 residents, mostly men, told reporters that they went outside in their nightclothes to investigate the sound, and saw a 200-foot high orange-colored mushroom of smoke, with a glowing core in its center. It was rising into the air. Other residents, too timid to investigate, reported that their rooms were flooded with orange light which "changed night into day."

One resident who was quoted, Mr. Bill Curtis, said he was used to firing from the army range four miles away, but he and others noted that the firings held about once a week were never like this. At last and that firings had never been held early in the morning. "It has no comparison to this," he said, "our house was like a ship rocking in a big sea."

Other residents reported shattered windows as a result of the "explosion."

An Army spokesman contacted by frightened residents of Warminster said the military authorities could not explain the blast, the strange color or the mushroom cloud.

On August 28th a photograph of the "thing" was reportedly taken. Carried in London's Daily Mirror, it looked like a man's hat, brim turned down, and top crushed with a large central crease. Turned upside down, the photo resembles a rather deeply-set eye with large pupil and small iris showing. The photographer, is young (23) Gordon Faulkner, a factory worker.

Faulkner claims that on the 29th, in early evening, he stepped out of the back door of his home, on his way to see his mother. He had taken his camera as his sister had asked to borrow it. He shut the door behind him, and saw the "thing". As it flew fast and low over the south of Warminster, he said he could just make out the unusual shape. It made no noise. Faulkner said he got his camera free and aimed. The line of flight was too fast to follow, so he held the camera well in front of the object and pressed the trigger as the object entered the view-finder. Faulkner said: "I didn't dream I'd get anything on film at all. It shook me right when I saw what came out of it all."

Faulkner then sent the photograph (after developing) to the Warminster Journal, thinking the editor (Shuttle-wood) would scoff. But he didn't. The camera is a Halina 35mm, and was focused on infinity at 1/50th second.

The September 11, 1965 issue of the Daily Mirror presented another photograph taken purportedly taken by Roy Coombs, 33, of Musaid-road, Battersea, London, on Monday, September 6th. Coombs claimed he was cycling when he saw the object, jumped off his bike and quickly focused the camera he was carrying. He took four pictures. He was located on Portsmouth road, just south of Surbiton, Surrey. He was on his way to Kingston upon the Thames to take photos of boats on the river, he said. "Suddenly I saw a glint in the sky. At first I thought it was a shooting star or perhaps an aircraft crashing. Then I saw this shape, moving very fast, which seemed to skim across the sky from the East." Coombs says he doesn't claim the thing was a flying saucer, but wants to know what it is. The object closely resembles the bell-shaped "Adamski-type UFO" or "flying saucer" photographs which are generally considered, by scientific investigators, to be spurious to say the least.

At this writing, there is no further word concerning either the Coombs or Faulkner photographs and if and when permission is secured to present them in this bulletin, if they warrant such exposure, documentation will be presented with this communication.

Sunnyvale, California

Sunnyvale, Calif. — Lt. John E. Haag and Officer Ronald Girard of the Public Safety Department were on duty at the fire station at Lawrence Station and Mountain View-Alviso roads when they watched a "brilliant white object" in the sky for 10 minutes from 9:33 to 9:43 p.m. on the 9th of July. Both officers declared they are familiar with aircraft in the area and that this object, after hovering over San Francisco, moved "faster than anything I'd ever seen before." It went straight up into the air and climbed three times its original distance from the ground which was about 20 degrees, then, without hesitating, it made a sharp turn southwest for about three miles and then turned northwest. Both officers were sure the object was not a star, and observed that it pulsated from dim to bright in three second cycles.

Haag claimed that three planes took off while the object was in the air and headed in its direction. He thought the planes might have been from Moffett AFB. Moffett officials denied that any planes from other bases might have been observed the object.

Airfield alert

Mme. S. Saunier of Courseulles sur
Mer, Normandy, sent us this interesting item from the October, 1965
edition of UFO Nederlands of Wiesbaden Schevening (translated into
French by J. Vuilleques): "On July
1965, just south of people in a town
observed a luminous object at an
altitude of about 5,000 meters. It was
transparent, but the middle was
darky, and those less than the rest,
according to the statement of a
meteorological official who observed the object through a theodolite.

"The machine was revolving
swiftly on its axis, and at the same
time describing small circles in such
a way that it appeared sometimes
round, sometimes oval. It remained
thus over the town, in the same place,
for as hour and a quarter.

"The control tower at the aerodrome of El-Aouina warned approaching aircraft to avoid any
possible collision.

"On the arrival of small clouds, the
UFO rose slowly towards the north
west without noise, and without
leaving any trace of condensation."

FLYING OBJECTS STOP CLOCKS
(China Mail, Hong Kong) (Lisbon, July 12, 1965)
Flying saucers (turned magnetic clocks) and stopped electric clocks, and kept the weekend vacationers agape.

The first mysterious flying object appeared in Mozambique, where Manuel Fernandez and his wife at first saw a luminous object which at first looked like a balloon.

Fernandez, an employee of the Portuguese railway, said that while he was watching the object, it was a flattened balloon, but the way it moved looked very strange.

"The thing was very luminous and had orange coloring and moved in a zigzag manner," he said. "It was out from a time green rays shot from a side.

The object slowed high altitude near the edifice about three kilometers, then flew towards the north.

Puzzled
Fernandez said his radio was playing while the object circled, but heavy interference, but replied the matter.

Another type of interference stopped the Mozambique clocks, guess Azores Archipelago.

A Portuguese said he saw a cylindrical object which arrived at 1945 GMT on Saturday, and 1945 GMT.

2 Tell of
Flying
Saucer
OPORTO, Portugal (UPI)
— A Portuguese couple today identified Flying Object they saw flying overhead last Friday as a "flying disk."

Manuel Fernandes, 40, and his wife Laura, saw the cylindrical-shaped object from their home near the Oporto Airport.

The sighting followed reports Friday of a similar object near Lisbon Airport in the Azores, 900 miles in the west.

The object hovered over the airport for 45 minutes before disappearing.

The sighting on the Portuguese mainland occurred at 9:30 p.m.

"It appeared at my right side," said Manuel Fernandes, "and the object 'I had the impression was crystalline and what flattened sphere."

From another point, Fernandes said to me, "It was big, deep dish, luminous and intermittently luminous."

His wife also said he saw the object.

The device came from the direction of the village of Santa Maria, according to Fernandes, who said "I saw it fly on to the next."

It remained stationary for that minute.

It had a reddish tinge and was out of one of the lights coming out of one of the sides.

Then it left at a fantastic speed.

In the Azores, 10 electromagnetic clocks stopped when the Unidentified Flying Object was sighted.

The Fernandes couple said radio static increased over their village.

The object disappeared, Fernandes said.

"alternatively to either side, very slightly."

In an attempt to estimate the object's size, Fernandes said that when he stretched out his arms and centered the object between his hands, there was a space about 20 inches between his hands. Because we do not know the height of the trees nor the elevation of the object we have made no attempt at triangulation, but it is obvious that the object was close and very large.

Fernandes estimated that the object stayed over the trees for about 3 minutes, then headed north at high speed. He noted that when the object departed there was no acceleration—it was as if it had been a bullet shot from a gun. He also noted that the radio in the bedroom had a great deal of static from the time the object first showed up until it sped off a few minutes later, when the radio program they had been listening to could be heard clearly again.

Three days prior to the Fernandes sighting, on the 9th, a story came out of Portugal concerning an unidentified object which was observed by personnel at the Santa Maria Airport in the Azores.

The Wire Press stories were generally led and rather vague, but fortunately, FATE magazine inquired into the incident via United Press International and considerable more was learned. It is from the account in the November 1965 issue that some of the following information was gleaned:

The object in question was cylinder-shaped and one of the first eye-witnesses to its passage over the island was Aristides Arruda, a 31-year-old gardener at the Terra Nostra Hotel. At 4:30 p.m. on the 9th, Arruda passed in his work at the hotel, and spotted the object. He said he thought it was a balloon at first, because it moved so slowly. Its course was southeast to northwest. The ground wind was generally opposite.

Another observer was 28-year-old Richard Godbold, a civilian radio expert working for the USAF Base at Lajes, Azores, and currently assigned to Santa Maria. Godbold had no opinion concerning what it was, said it could have been a balloon. A taxicab driver also saw the object but could offer no description which would help to identify it.

In the FATE story, UPI noted that Lajes Airport Officials were strangely silent about the object, with a "no comment" attitude. The initial news break had mentioned the fact that the electronic-magnetic clocks at the airport had stopped while the UFO was over the base, and later press reports said a technician had made an error and turned them off. UPI found out that while the repairman was attempting to diagnose the trouble, the clocks started ticking again AFTER THE UFO LEFT THE AREA.

Most estimates of the object's altitude was about 21,000 feet. A twin-engined SATA plane took off from Santa Maria airport while the UFO was in sight, and the pilot sighted the object. However, the object went into a cigar-shaped while cloud and was lost to his view.

Lajes officials indicated that no weather balloons were launched from the Air Force base on July 9th, but press reports a few days after the sighting was initially reported, said the object was probably just a balloon and the clock stopping a coincidental accident. The people at the Airport who gave the story of the strange object and the stopped clocks to the world on July 10th, no longer care to discuss the incident.

The Portuguese UAOs

Shortly after 4:30 a. m. on the 12th of July, 1965, Mr. and Mrs. Manuel Fernandez of Motsinhos, Portugal, as was their custom, Mrs. Fernandez headed toward the outdoors well with buckets to get water. She took a quick look at the eastern sky to determine the day's weather, and spotted a strange-looking object coming out of the northeast, from the direction of the ocean. During later interviews Mrs. F. admitted she was startled as she knew immediately that the thing was no airplane, with which she was familiar.

The object, which looked like a "Cardinal's hat," had a round "brim" and a rounded top. It stopped over the woods near the Fernandez home, and Mrs. Fernandez dropped her buckets and ran to get her husband.

During a later interview, Mr. F. said his wife was so excited he had difficulty understanding what she told him and at first thought she had found a cardinal's hat in the courtyard. When he looked, he saw the thing about a quarter of a mile away from the house. He said the object had a dark, round brim and a brilliant orange-colored round top which looked as if it was lighted from the inside. "At one point on the brim, exactly on the side closer to the airport, there was a red intensely flickering light," Fernandez reported. Although it stayed just above the trees, the object leaned

Flying saucers are zipping again

LISBON (AP-Reuters) - Strange objects moving through space were reported in two widely-separated areas of Portugal during the weekend, with some witnesses claiming interference from radio and television sets.

Descriptions of the objects were strikingly similar, with Chilean military reports and Argentine sources cited.

The first reported mysterious flying object appeared in Mozambique, near the northern city of Oporto, where Manuel Fernandes said he first saw the object as a "strange balloon."

Fernandes, an employee of the local power company, said "the strange object at first appeared to be a balloon. As we watched, it looked like a plate moving over."

He added that the object was moving at high speed, and had a way of stopping and going at will, the couple said.

He added a "cyclindrical object" was seen over New Shingles of unidentified flying objects were reported Saturday.

A similar type of interference was reported by an employee of the luminous clocks of the Villa do Porto weather bureau. He said the object circled over a forest near the house, but then disappeared without interrupting the music.

A similar type of interference with magnetic clocks of the Villa do Porto weather bureau was reported.

It was reported to have hung in the sky for several minutes over the shooting of a trail of flames.

In Montevideo, a local Uruguayan news agency reported it saw a luminous flying object changing color above a beach in the River Plate area.

A police corporal was reported as saying he and his whole family saw a flat, blue-colored object hovering over the northeastern Argentine town of Chaco.

Flying Saucer Stops Clocks, Say Reports From Portugal
LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Strange objects moving through two widely-separated areas of Portugal Sunday.

The Lisbon Weather Bureau claimed electronic interference from one of the objects sighted in the arctic last week.

Descriptions of the objects were similar to official Argentine and Chilean military sightings in the arctic last week.

THE FIRST REPORTED mysterious flying object appeared near the northern city of Montijo, where Manuel Fernandes and his wife at first saw "some sort of luminous flat-tended balloon."

The thing was very luminous, had great orange coloring, and was nearly red at times. The couple said at times green rays shot out from a side.

The saucer stopped at rather high altitude, near the coast, for about three minutes. Then, with an incredible velocity, it sped towards the north.

FERNANDES SAID his radio was playing while the object circled over a forest near his house, but that heavy interference stopped the radio.

A similar type of interference stopped the electronic Weather Bureau in the Portuguese Azores Archipelago.

A spokesman said, He added, a "cylindrical white object" circled around in the sky.

FLYING SAUCERS OVER PORTUGAL: Strange objects moving through space were reported in widely-separated parts of Portugal on July 12th. The first appeared in Botalema, where a man named Manuel Fernandes and his wife watched an object which looked "like a plate turned over." It was very luminous, with an orange coloring, and at times green rays shot out from one side. The saucer passed at high altitude, near Coana, and then, sped toward the north at incredible velocity. Fernandes added that he was playing his radio at the time of the sighting, and noticed heavy interference when the object circled over a forest near his home.

A similar type of interference stopped the electromagnetic clocks for 45 minutes at the Villa do Porto watched bureau, at the same time "cyclindrical white object" circled around in the sky. However, a follow-up report, claiming that both sightings were caused by weather balloons, states that the carelessness of an electrician who was stopped because of the correlations of an electrician who was repairing the system.

PRECEDE VILLA DO PORTO FLYING SAUCERS A7

BY DENNIS REDMONT

LISBON, PORTUGAL, JULY 11 (AP)--STRANGE OBJECTS MOVING THROUGH SPACE WERE REPORTED SIGHTED IN TWO WIDELY-SEPARATED AREAS OF PORTUGAL TODAY. THE AZORES WEATHER BUREAU CLAIMED INTERFERENCE FROM ONE STOPPED ITS ELECTROMAGNETIC CLOCKS.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE OBJECTS WERE STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO OFFICIAL ARGENTINE AND CHILEAN MILITARY REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS IN THE ANTARCTIC LAST WEEK.

THE FIRST REPORTED MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECT APPEARED IN MOTOSINHO, NEAR THE NORTHERN CITY OF OPORTO, WHERE MANUEL FERNANDES, AND HIS WIFE AT FIRST SAW "SOME SORT OF LUMINOUS FLATTENED BALLOON."

FERNANDES, AN EMPLOYE OF THE FISHERMEN'S UNION, SAID "THE STRANGE OBJECT AT FIRST SIGHT LOOKED LIKE A FLATTENED BALLOON, BUT THEN AS WE BOTH WATCHED, IT LOOKED LIKE A PLATE TURNED OVER. WITH THIN WAS VERY LUMINOUS, AND ORANGE COLORING AND WAS NEARLY RED AT TIMES," THE COUPLE SAID, "AND AT TIMES GREEN RAYS SHOT OUT FROM A SIDE."

"THE SAUCER STOPPED AT RATHER HIGH ALTITUDE, NEAR THE COAST, FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES. THEN, WITH AN INCREDIBLE VELOCITY, IT SPED TOWARDS THE NORTH."

FERNANDES SAID HIS RADIO WAS PLAYING WHILE THE OBJECT CIRCLED OVER A FOREST NEAR THE HOUSE, BUT THAT HEAVY INTERFERENCE INTERRUPTED THE MUSIC.

A SIMILAR TYPE OF INTERFERENCE STOPPED THE ELECTROMAGNETIC CLOCKS OF THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER BUREAU IN THE PORTUGUESE AZORES ARCHIPELAGO. A SPOKESMAN SAID HE ADDED A "CYCLINDRICAL WHITE OBJECT" CIRCLED AROUND IN THE SKY.

THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE OBJECT WAS MOVING SLOWLY NORTHEAST AT AN ALTITUDE OF 24,000 TO 30,000 FEET. HE STATED IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CURRENT GEOPHYSICAL OBSERVATION BEING MADE BY PORTUGUESE, FRENCH AND BRITISH VESSELS IN THE AZORES ISLANDS.

"WE ARE COMPLETELY PUZZLED," HE SAID.

FLYING SAUCERS
BY JERRY BUCK
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
NEW YORK, JULY 20 (AP)--SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE
SEEING MORE IN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE WING.
FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING
OBJECTS ZIPPING THROUGH SPACE AND, IN SOME REPORTED CASES, INTERFERING
WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC EQUIPMENT.
AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST
TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNEXPLAINED.
BUT A GLOWING OBJECT THAT CAUSED A COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO
MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT ARE THESE OBJECTS?
THE AIR FORCE, WHICH HAS LOOKED INTO 9,127 REPORTED SIGHTINGS
TO DATE SINCE 1947, SAID THEY'RE USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS, SEARCHLIGHTS,
JET EXHAUSTS--OR THE RED AND WHITE KITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
CHILD.
TO DATE, THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, AND
MOST OF THESE, IT SAID, COULD BE EXPLAINED AWAY IF MORE INFORMATION
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY, PROJECT
BLUEBOOK AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAYTON, OHIO.
THE AIR FORCE SAID 18 YEARS OF INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE.
DISAGREEING WITH THE AIR FORCE IS MAJ. DONALD E. KEYHOE, A
RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

£A52
"THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND
SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME
ADVANCED CIVILIZATION," SAID KEYHOE.
KEYHOE CONTENDS THE AIR FORCE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION YEARS
AGO, BUT HAS "A HIGH LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS NOT TO SCARE PEOPLE."
THE SAUCER SEASON GOT OFF TO A FLYING START IN EUROPE JULY 7.
"IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA HORLOCK, WHO, WITH
HER HUSBAND HAROLD, SPOTTED A FIERY OBJECT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR
WARMINSTER, ENGLAND.
THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW
TAKING OFF FROM HIS FARM AN OBJECT THAT RESEMBLED A LARGE FOOTBALL
WITH FOUR METAL LEGS. "WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," SAID AN OFFICIAL.
THE NEXT DAY THE CHILEAN AIR FORCE AND ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED
THAT CHILEAN, ARGENTINE AND BRITISH PERSONNEL IN ANTARCTICA SAW A
LENS-SHAPED OBJECT--YELLOWISH RED, CHANGING TO GREEN, YELLOW AND
ORANGE--THAT AFFECTED INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE MAGNETIC FIELDS.
OVER PORTUGAL AND THE AZORES JULY 10 MORE FLYING THINGS WERE
SEEN. THE VILA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING
OBJECT APPEARED OVER THE ISLAND AND THAT THE BUREAU'S ELECTROMAGNETIC
CLOCK STOPPED.
AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND
OTHER EXPERT AIRCRAFT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT
GLINTING IN THE SUN NEAR THE AIRPORT AT CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA. IT WAS
VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS
SENT AFTER IT.
ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS.
MRS. LAWRENCE FRAZIER SAID HER SONS, RONALD, 20, AND ROBERT 27,
SAW "PULSATING LIGHTS SPREAD OUT OVER THE SKY." SHE SAID IT
"SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."

WE HAVE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED THE OBJECT AS A BALLOON," SAID AN
OFFICIAL AT PROJECT BLUEBOOK. "THE AIR FORCE'S INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY
FOR UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO).

"WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WHICH BALLOON UNTIL WE RECOVER THE PACKAGE," SAID
SGT. DAVID MOODY.

HE SAID FOUR BALLOONS WERE RELEASED JULY 5 BY THE U. S. NAVY AT
CHURCHILL, MAN., ON HUDSON BAY. TWO OF THE BALLOONS, USED FOR COSMIC
RAY RESEARCH, ARE MISSING, MOODY SAID.

HE SAID THE BALLOONS, 200 TO 300 FEET TALL, ARE VALUED AT ABOUT
$1,000,000, INCLUDING THEIR SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC CARGO.

MOODY SAID THE BALLOONS NORMALLY FLY ABOUT 125,000 FEET.

THE SKY OBJECT WAS REPORTED SEEN BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN OHIO,
PENNSYLVANIA, WEST VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND LAST MONDAY NIGHT. SOME SAID IT
GLOWED, OTHERS SAID IT BEAMED A SPOTLIGHT ON THE GROUND.

MOODY SAID PROJECT BLUEBOOK CONSIDERS SUCH REPORTS "PERSONAL INTER-
PRETATIONS." HE DECLINED FURTHER COMMENT.

HE SAID SIMILAR SIGHTINGS OVER THE AZORES AND PORTUGAL HAVE BEEN
TRACED TO ANOTHER RESEARCH BALLOON RELEASED OVER INDIA.

MOODY SAID THAT A BALLOON WAS RELEASED BY THE NATIONAL
COUNCIL FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, WHICH HAS HEADQUARTERS AT BOULDER,
COLO.

HE SAID HIS OFFICE AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE COULD NOT COMMENT ON REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECTS OVER
CHILE AND AUSTRALIA BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO INVESTIGATE.

Dear Sir,

Thank you for sending the information on UFOs. I appreciate your reply.

Approximately a week ago while giving the news on a Radio station I came upon a news spot regarding a UFO stopping an Electro-Magnetic clock at the Azores islands. As you probably know it was sighted by the Weather Bureau over there. On the next news cast another story came in on the AP wires saying that a UFO had been sighted in Portugal. Has an additional information been gathered on this?

Awaiting your reply I am

Sincerely,

On 14 Jul 65 Mr Al Morris called from NCAR he had Mr Vincent Lalloy in his office. Lalloy had a news clipping of the Azores, he thinks it was one of his balloons on its second go around. on 23 Jun 65 they launched a couple of unusual super pressures, balloons, to check out how stable they are, one was a conventional balloon 10,000 feet, tracked for a few days, another balloon was at around 6500 ft, two balloons tied together, 20 ft long 18 inches in diameter, they were just strapped together, looked like one long cylinder, with payload, if it would have survived it would be at an altitude of 6000ft.

In order to clarify, would have to find an observer who would saw it was long, size of the balloon is not important, the shape was good, the payload should be vertical, can we check this for NCAR. Lalky will be flying from new Zealand on a project starting in September for 127 nations. He mentioned that the Air Force Cambridge Research Lab is flying things but won't tell.

Should talk to a Tom Kelley 274-6100, ext 3013.

We talked to Cambridge Massachusetts again and they said no they didn't have any classified balloon projects at present and all balloons were accounted for.

TODAY A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT SIGHTED OVER THE AZORES SATURDAY WAS
PROBABLY A BALLOON AND NOT A FLYING SAUCER.
"AND AS FAR AS THE STOPPING OF ELECTRIC CLOCKS IS CONCERNED,"
THE DIRECTOR OF THE SANTA MARIA (AZORES) AREA, WITH US NOT
MOTIVATED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE, BUT BY THE CARELESSNESS
OF AN ELECTRICIAN WHO WAS REPAIRING THE SYSTEM.
A SPOKESMAN AT AN AZORES WEATHER STATION HAS SAID THE OBJECT
WHICH GLOWED IN THE SKY STOPPED THE STATION'S ELECTROMAGNETIC CLOCKS.
A SIMILAR DESCRIBED OBJECT HAS SIGHTED BY A COUPLE OVER NORTHERN
PORTUGAL SUNDAY. THE COUPLE SAID THE OBJECT CAUSED INTERFERENCE
ON THEIR RADIO.
HERMANO CABRAL, HEAD OF AN AZORES AIRCRAFT COMPANY WHO SAW THE
OBJECT, DESCRIBED IT AS "A LONGISH BALLOON, WHICH APPEARED OF
TRANSPARENT PLASTIC."
A CHILEAN AIR FORCE REPORT SAID LAST WEEK THAT CHILEAN, BRITISH
AND ARGENTINE SCIENTISTS AND PERUVIAN SAW A GLOWING OBJECT ZIP

Mrs [illegible text] Dayton, Ohio called on 13 Jul 65 regarding a UFO observation by her and her neighbor.

She was quite confused as to direction, description etc.

It was a silver ring, little white cloud, then it burst into two objects. Her husband could not see object and wasn't believe her. It was either 11 or 12 Jul 65 when she observed object.

Object also had points like a star, then went up and went NW, two came out of cloud, shaped like points, then there were two round objects and dangled around. She saw more than two objects.

Since she was confused Sgt Moody suggested that she fill out an FTD Form 164. This is agreeable. Form was sent to her on 13 Jul 65.

Supposedly object has been seen twice in two weeks. Ten color photographs have been taken by the Chileans who observed object for 20 minutes. Argentina said it moved at high speed. Next notification 7 Jul, R-168 from Santiago, Chili, dispatch time 753 pm. The Commander of the Argentina believed it to be adventurous to call it a flying saucer. It also included mention that it caused interference in the electromagnetic apparatus. In a radio interview the Chilean Base said it was not a star, nor was it an earth filled a/c, Commander Jahn said that they did not have the photos available because they had no means to develop color film. Notification R-169 said the object was first seen by the British and informed that Argentina and Chilean bases also observed, stopped in mid air and hovered for few minutes. Comment was that scientists are skeptical of its extraterrestrial origin. (Felt that this comment was added by newsmen). Hugo Morlando of an astronomical observe said such phenomena can be explained by physical appearances in the atmosphere, could be a refraction. R-32 from the Buenos Aires, 7 Jul, dispatched 559 am. Argentina has confirmed appearance of celestial body on the horizon and two antartic bases on the evening of July 3rd, shaped like a lens, mainly red and green, yellow, blue and white. Navy statement, the object made no noise, moved eastward with occasional westward with change of speed, sometimes appeared to hover, body

Memo for the Record:   On 8 Jul 65 at 0940 hours, Major Mateko from 1127th Field Activities Group called regarding UFO reports from Santo Domingo, Chili, British and Argentina Stations on a Rostefer Dispatch. (British UPI), R163 and R169, dispatched from Santo Diego 7 Jul at 753 pm. Three stations in Antartic, Chilean, British and Argentina stations all reporting sighting an object over the horizon. Stations are all fairly far apart from each other. Objs observed on 3 Jul 65.

The Chilean Commander is an Air Force pilot who said the object appeared to be solid, had magnetic distractions, traveled fast, hovered. Speed was such that it was not an aircraft or anything made on earth. Maj Mateko said this was the classic UFO. British and Argentina stations observed it for ten minutes, zig zag overhead, stopped, hovered. They took photos.

"SUDDENLY," MASSE SAID, "THE CRAFT TOOK OFF AND DISAPPEARED IN THE SKY. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES."

MASSE SAID HE WENT TO THE SPOT AND FOUND TRACKS LEFT BY THE LEGS AND THAT THE GROUND WAS PACKED HARD AS CONCRETE.

A GENDARMERIE OFFICER SAID STRANGE TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN AND THAT THE GROUND WAS HARD-PACKED. MASSE, WHO HAS A REPUTATION AS A CALM AND SOLID CITIZEN, WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE LAVENDER PLANTS IN HIS FIELD BEING TRAMPLED BY THE CROWDS, WHO CONTINUED TO ARRIVE TODAY.

"WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," ONE GENDARME SAID.

On July 1st at 11:50 p.m., I saw something for which I have no explanation; nonetheless, my husband and I watched a small twelve acres fruit farm here in Montville, N.J., which he works on a part-time basis. We live on the farm.

Being very weather conscious, I always glance at the sky while walking our dog every night. On this particular evening, I noticed two tall pine trees. At first I thought it was a small plane, but I then realized, when the lights moved closer and lower, that it could not have been.

The lights passed between two large cherry trees on either side of our driveway, not more than fifty feet in the air, and only about three hundred feet in front of me. It could not have been larger than 25 feet to pass between these two trees. Unfortunately, because of the darkness, I could not distinguish any outline - just the two stark white lights blinking simultaneously and traveling very slowly. They continued on, and I watched them till they disappeared. There was no sound. My dog barked, and I could hear the neighbor's dog barking. Making no think that I am could have emitted a sound of a higher pitch than those audible to the human ear. The lights appeared to be about three inches in diameter and about three to four feet apart. They did not illuminate the area surrounding them or give forth any beam of light....

MS. G. CRANNIS, Montvale, N.J.

(Editor's Note: This is only one of the many unpublished sightings that we received this past summer, through our appearances on the Randi Shows. Unfortunately, lack of space prevents us from publishing the others at this time.)

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:   26 Jul 65

Received a call from [redacted], Dayton, Ohio 45440 regarding an unidentified object which he observed last night at 930 or 945 pm. Object moved East, slightly SE then took a pronounced SE direction. Looked similar to one of the satellites, however it was flying much faster. Observed for only 15-30 seconds. Asked him if he would mind filling out a form and said he would be as happy to fill one out. Also said that there were several neighbors in the yard who also observed the object.

Additional Note: ECHO I, ECHO II, PEGASUS I & II were not visible at this time of evening.

1 July 1965
Valencole, France

"Flying Saucers", officially called "Unidentified Flying Objects" started July off with a bang with a report of a landing of a four-legged round object containing a small human form inside of it, which was reported by farmer Maurice Masse, 41, in the mountain village of Valencole, France on Thursday morning July 1. At the landing spot tracks left by the landing gears and hard packed ground were found by the gendarmes that investigated the encounter. The gendarmes believe the encounter was an authentic one.

BY JERRY BUCK
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
NEW YORK, JULY 20 (AP)-SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE
SEEING MORE STRANGE THINGS IN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE WING

FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECTS ZIPPING THROUGH SPACE AND, IN SOME REPORTED CASES, INTERFERING WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC EQUIPMENT.

AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNEXPLAINED.

BUT A GLOWING OBJECT THAT CAUSED A COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.

WHAT ARE THESE OBJECTS?
THE AIR FORCE, WHICH HAS LOOKED INTO 9,127 REPORTED SIGHTINGS TO DATE SINCE 1947, SAYS THEY'RE USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS, SEARCHLIGHTS, JET EXHAUSTS-OR THE RED AND WHITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR'S CHILD.

TO DATE, THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, AND MOST OF THESE, SAID, COULD BE EXPLAINED AWAY IF MORE INFORMATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY, PROJECT BLUEBOOK AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAYTON, OHIO.

THE AIR FORCE SAID IT IS 18 YEARS OF INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE, DISAGREEING WITH THE AIR FORCE IS MAJ. DONALD E. KEYHOE, RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

£A52
"THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME ADVANCED CIVILIAN," SAID KEYHOE.

KEYHOE CONTENDS THE AIR FORCE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSIONS YEARS AGO, BUT HAS "A HIGH LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS NOT TO SCARE PEOPLE."

THE SAUCER SEASON GOT OFF TO A FLY-STARTING IN EUROPE JULY 7, THAT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING, SAID MRS. DORA HORLOCK, WHO WITH HER HUSBAND HAROLD, SPOTTED A FIERY OBJECT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR VALENSOLE, FRANCE. MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW TAKING OFF FROM HIS FARM AN OBJECT THAT RESEMBLED A LARGE FOOTBALL WITH FOUR METAL LEGS. "WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," SAID AN OFFICIAL.

THE NEXT DAY THE CHILEAN AIR FORCE AND ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED THAT CHILEAN, ARGENTINE AND BRITISH PERSONNEL IN ANTARCTICA SAW A LENS-SHAPED OBJECT THAT YELLOW RED, CHANGING TO GREEN, YELLOW AND ORANGE-THAT AFFECTED INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE MAGNETIC FIELDS.

OVER PORTUGAL AND THE AZORES JULY 10 MORE FLYING THINGS WERE SEEN. THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING OBJECT APPEARED OVER THE ISLAND AND THAT THE BUREAU'S ELECTROMAGNETIC CLOCK WAS STOPPED.

AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND OTHER EXPERT AIRCRAFT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT GLOWING IN THE SUN NEAR AIR CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA; IT WAS VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS SENT TO INVESTIGATE.

ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS. MRS. LAWRENCE FRAZER SAID HER SONS, RONALD, 20, AND ROBERT 27, SAW "PULSATING LIGHTS...SPREAD OUT OVER THE SKY." SHE SAID IT "SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."

Landing in France

At 5:00 on the morning of the 1st of July 1965, Maurice Masse, 41, a farmer at Valensole (France), left his home to go to his lavender field about two kilometers outside Valensole. When he arrived at the field, he began to hoe the flowers, then his attention was arrested by a strange noise like a whistling which seemed to fill the whole countryside. He walked around the slope or terrace and saw a strange object about 30 meters away. The object had an oblong shape like a big football, made about 4 meters long.

It was about the size of a Dauphine (a French car), and had a dull, flat, relax finish. He said the object reminded him of a big spider, and it was poised on four metallic feet "to which was attached a central pivot."

What interested Masse was the most was the presence near the machine of a being whose height and weight he compared to that of an eight-year-old child. The "little man" was wearing an orange-colored space suit but no helmet or headpiece. Inside the object, another occupant, about the same size as the one on the ground, and dressed on the same small being on the ground turned, saw Masse, and jumped into the opening in the side of the object through which the second occupant had been seen, the door slid shut, and the object took off with a "deafening whistling" sound, the same as had first attracted Masse's attention. The object ascended vertically at very high speed without giving off smoke or dust.

Masse informed the police at Valensole whereupon the site of the landing was investigated. The gendarmes found a hole of 20 centimeters diameter and 50 in depth. Some marks, (four), like furrows extended from the hole outward, describing an "X" in the ground. The dirt where the central pivot had rested was baked and hard, almost like cement. The surrounding soil was, however, normal.

Subsequent investigations revealed that no normal aircraft had been in the area which could account for the object seen by Mr. Masse. Masse, the father of two children, is considered to be a reliable and honest individual and not capable of perpetrating a hoax.

The Valensole Affair
By Aime Michel

YOU have learned the essential details of the Valensole affair from the excellent text of G.C. who investigated the case on behalf of G.E.P.A. There are one or two small details which need correcting, such as the distance being 90 metres instead of 80, and the fact that M. Masse approached the machine across a vineyard, and not a field of lavender, like this:

[A hand-drawn diagram showing a UFO near a lavender field and vineyard]

Here now are a few additional points:
(a) the traces of the lavender are visible for a good hundred metres or so along the take-off trajectory, as far as a little shanty called La Clermontine, towards Manosque, and even beyond. These traces are a "phenomenon of the young shoots prior to July 1", which are going dry and falling off, and a singular vitality of the shoots after July 1.

(b) For about a week before July 1, M. Masse and his farmer, who were working daily in their field, noticed on their arrival each morning damage and some young lavender plants, as if some body had taken some specimens every night. The plants had not been pulled up, but sprout had been cut off, or rather broken off and removed from their plant. Thus the two farmers were already puzzled by something abnormal in their field.

(c) One very important point in the Masse evidence is the following: at the moment when the object took off, it very rapidly developed a great speed and completely vanished at twenty metres. Aime Michel: How do you mean vanished? Do you mean that the speed became so great that you were no longer able to follow it with your eyes? Valerie Masse: I can't see any other explanation. But my impression was different: at one moment I could see it very well; and the following instant I could no longer see anything.

[The text continues with a dialogue between Aime Michel and Valerie Masse]

NO CALL
SOURCE:

ordinary Earth men selected from the human species just like lavender plants in a field; this bred product has perhaps been scientifically super-humanized in order to play a part in the history of our relations with the entities—unknown and invisible—who are the real ones responsible for the ufological manifestations. The numerous descriptions of "little men" collected over the past fifteen years strongly remind one of our own domestic breeding of animals, though this idea is repugnant to our dignity and to the respect that we have for the human person (without however extending that respect to animals).

"The little men" put one in mind of human base-hounds, selected in view of their utilization within the framework of a superior technology. There would be much that we could say about these little men, but one detail strike me particularly: all who have approached them—so far as I know—and M. Masse has affirmed it to me forcibly, several times—believe invincibly in their benevolence towards ourselves. "They are good. They have only good intentions towards us," of that I am sure."

"But how do you know that?" I asked.
"I can't tell you. I don't know how I know.
But I am sure of it."

Is this a psychological conditioning connected with the effect of the weapon? Or, more simply, is it the truth? On this too there would be much that one could say.

Comment on Valensole
Is it possible that the whole truth of the incident at Valensole still eludes us? That it was in fact another A.V.B. ("Adhemral") type of contact case? At least that is what Gordon Creighton wondered as he was completing his translation.

Speculatively, maybe, but when one considers M. Masse's embarrassed reluctance to tell the full story, not to mention his fear of possible genetic effects, and the strange revelation that he eventually broke down and told his family cryptically, it seems that such a solution of the mystery is 'on the cards.'

As soon as space permits, we will retell the Antonio Villas Boas (Athemnar) story of "Interplanetary procreation", for many additional details have come to light in the O Cruzeiro account.

the spot at a certain point on its trajectory?
(d)(M.: (with a gesture of helplessness), I don't
know, Sir. I haven't understood anything at all
about it. But such was indeed my impression.
(First remark on this question: there are numerous precedents for such disappearance on the spot.)

Space-Time well beyond the most advanced
present-day Physics, and perhaps explain the fact
that the Minitrack optical network have never
photographed the approach of any UFO in circumterrestrial space. The UFO would accordingly be
capable of non-linear movements.

(d) M. Masse felt nothing particular in himself
during the first three days. It was on the fourth
day that he suddenly collapsed, seized with an incredible desire to sleep. He slept 12 hours the first
24 hours per day if his wife and his father, frightened, had not woken him up to make him eat. He
would no longer talk, and remained sleepy.
(Details confirmed by Gendarmerie commandant
Oliva). No neuro-vegetative disturbance, deep
sleep, with no memory of any dreams, and apparently no psychic or physiological disturbance
being: Slight psycho-motor impairment: a tendency to trembling in the hands (still observable on
August 8). Before July 1, Masse used to sleep for
4 to 5 hours at night. After that date, for from
12 to 15.

Since July 1 his watch has been slow. It causes a
normal variation of 3 degrees on the compass, which is
normal for a steel watch.

(c) People have been wrong in calling the
immobilization caused by the little pilot's weapon
"paralysis". If Masse's muscles had been paralyzed, he would have died there and then from
stoppage of the heart, which is a muscle, or from
anoxia.

If we are to assume that the weapon could have
had a selective effect only upon the nerves of his
brain, we would not have been able to see him
stand up. In fact we know in Neurology only one
phenomenon that answers M. Masse's description.
And that is — post-hypnotic suggestion.

The new and important facts in the Valensole
affair are numerous. Up to now, it had been
possible for us to think that the "little men" were
the ones responsible for all the ufological manifestations, that they were the pilots of the craft, their
builders, originating from another world.

Now, M. Masse has seen them, with the heads an
the face, typically human (and not merely
humanoid). The bare head and hands suggest an
adaptation to the exact terrestrial atmospheric
composition and terrestrial atmospheric pressure.
The absolutely human form of the body and the
facial expressions, recognizable by a man, suggest a
human genetic code. Moreover, the description of
the skull and the face corresponds very exactly to
the description of the human type: brachycephalic
evolution of Man: increased cephalization, vegetative part of the face in regression (see, for example,
the anthropological studies of the Boskop prehistoric African man).

All these details could give a new lease of life to
the Wellsian hypothesis of men from the Future
visiting our present time. One can (at least in this
word here) one can suppose that the "little men"
are a product of a system of being here on

about anything else. Questioning him, the Café proprietor can see that he is upset and does not for a second doubt that the matter is serious. M. Masse did not want to say anything more, that nobody would believe him. . . . His friend advises him to go straight away and inform the gendarmes, but M. Masse, who has never been in any sort of trouble, and doesn't want to have any, replies that everything he has said is untrue and that it was just a joke. The Café proprietor then rushes off to the field, and finds the marks, and this is how the story gets out . . .

It is at this point or shortly afterwards that the mad rush of journalists and reporters from the radio and television networks takes place. . . .

M. Masse confines himself to his first statements, even among his near relatives, and retires within himself and becomes taciturn, as though his mind is far away. Whereas he used to sleep entirely normally before, he is now seized by an overpowering drowsiness; he needs 12 to 14 hours of sleep daily during the days immediately after the occurrence.

I have omitted to state that, on the evening of July 1, he went to the spot with his 18-year-old daughter. He saw once more the famous marks, which you have the sketch. But M. Masse explains that two of the six legs left no marks on the ground, namely the legs at (a) and (b):

[A hand-drawn sketch of a circular object with six legs is shown, with two legs (a) and (b) marked]

That morning, after the machine had taken off, a sort of liquid mud had remained around the central hole; when he goes there in the evening with his daughter—whom he forbids to go too close to it—he finds that this mud has set like cement. He himself compares the hole to a sort of funnel in reverse, there being a sump-shaped hole at the bottom, at a depth of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60 to 80 cms.

M. Masse feared that if his daughter went too close to the hole, she might suffer some harmful influence, and, although I cannot assert this with certitude, it seemed to us that he harboured some apprehension regarding the good health and the physical condition of the children that he might beget subsequently.

M. Masse and his wife tried to escape from the newspaper—"whose insinuations had disgusted them", and they went off to Giens but it was there that the reporter of Europe-No. 1 caught up with M. Masse again!

I think that it was on his return from Giens that, unable to stand it any longer, M. Masse started sobbing once evening, so his wife tells us, and then, as she puts it, he "let himself go" and gave the whole story of what had happened."

(About the landing site) M. Masse tells me that in himself had filled in the hole but that, strangely enough, the soil at the spot continues to sink slightly despite the earth he has put there.

I have found no difference in colour between the plants adjacent to the site of the landing and the others. I have however taken some colour-photographs which I will send you as I have got them back. Various individuals whom I have questioned on the subject say they noticed nothing. . . . More interesting, in my opinion, is this: M. Masse had pointed out to me that some heads of lavender, wilted, he said, by the passage of the saucer when it took off, had "picked up since" and were, or at least certain ones were, finer and taller than the average of the others. There were still little fideal stalks on these plants. . . .

(In an interview with Captain Valnet of the Investigation Brigade at Digne, Monsieur G. C. learned that M. Masse is considered). . . an intelligent and well-balanced man who, far from giving the impression of a hoaxer, seemed rather to be very receptive with the whole business.

(Finally) Before I conclude the account of our talks with the Masse family, want to emphasize the impression of complete good faith left on us by these folk who have become very sensitive—especially, perhaps, Madame Masse—as a result of what has happened to them.

THE SIGNIFICANT REPORT FROM FRANCE

[The rest of the text is as follows:]

In the September/October issue of the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW we gave a bare newspaper account of this classic case from the Basses Alpes district of France: [rest of paragraph is partially illegible]

[Main text begins with:]

M. MASSE was in his lavender field, a little north of Valensole, and near the road to Oraison, at about 5:30 a.m. on July 1, 1965, as is his customary practice. He had not yet started up his tractor, which had been left parked behind a mound of rubble about 2 metres high. He was just about to do so, and was lighting a cigarette, when he heard a whistling noise, the source of which he could not locate. He then stepped out from behind the mound with his cigarette in hand and saw, at a distance of about 80 metres from him, a peculiarly shaped machine which had landed in his field. His first thought was of a helicopter, but he realized that this could not be one. He was too familiar with these Army craft which, whether or not in difficulties, frequently land in his field or near by. He never fails each time to go over and chat with the pilots who are very frequently keen hunters like himself.

SAUCER HOVERS OVER CAR IN WASHINGTON STATE: A July 2nd incident, which apparently was not reported to the press till mid-August, centers around a woman named Mrs. A. H. Bundage, who had a terribly unnerving experience while driving her car along a lonely road near Kent, Washington, at about midnight.

Suddenly the car stopped dead in the road, for no reason, and the headlights went out. Then she saw glowing objects hovering over her hood, only a few inches in the air, spinning slowly. Mrs. Bundage said the object reminded her of a gigantic version of a child's top. It was about as wide as the automobile.

After about two minutes, the object made a "sort of whistling swish," and swept over the trees to her left, out of sight. The car then started up again after a little trouble; but the next day the battery was dead. The car clock, which kept perfect time and had been set that same day, was found the next day to be two minutes slow. Indicating that it had stopped during the period of time that the UFO was at close range.

Mrs. Bundage was so frightened by the encounter that she has refused to drive alone over that stretch of road at night any more.

too stopped. The objects had now formed an equilateral triangle in which they stayed for as long as I had a chance to observe them. I lost sight of them when I went into the dense trees by Slidell. The next time I had a chance to observe them, about 15 min. later, they had disappeared.

When visible, the objects had been in a position about 55 degrees above the eastern horizon. I had supposed these to be airplanes at first because they were in the general flight pattern for Moisant International Airport at New Orleans, but after the first object had stopped it was obvious they were not airplanes. I don't think it was a balloon from the way they acted. Following is a map of the area where these were spotted:

[Hand-drawn map with labels including: Lake, Marsh, Trees, Past Here, U.S. 90, Beach Houses, Rigoletz Bridge]

These are all the details about the two incidents I know and can remember. I have never seen any of these phenomena before or since these sightings in all the time I have observed the skies. If you know the cause of these phenomena I would like to be told of it. Thank You.

Sincerely,

P.S. The Second sighting occurred at 9:00 PM. From the angle they were from my position they would have been over marsh or the Gulf on the assumption they were 1 to 2 miles high.

Dear Sirs:

I am fifteen and quite interested in these "U.F.O.'s" in an impartial way. There are two incidents that I witnessed, along with other people, that might interest you. These incidents occurred near Slidell, Louisiana,about ten miles N.E. of New Orleans,in the summer and fall of 1965,I think. I believe these are of importance because they were both observed within a few miles of the Marshall Space Flight Centers at Michoud in New Orleans,the computer center in Slidell,and the Mississippi Test Facility 15 miles north of Slidell.

The first incident happened in the summer at 8:00 P.M.. It was spotted over Boy Scout Camp Salmen traveling west to east in a zig-zag pattern and maintained an unsteady speed. The object became visible about 40 Degrees above the western horizon,was in sight for half an hour,then disappeared in the east about 40 or 45 degrees above the horizon. Some of we amateur astronomers decided it could have been a balloon. The object was equal in size and brilliance to a second magnitude star.

The second sighting I observed was E.S.E. of Slidell in a large marsh near an inlet into Lake Pontchartrain called the Rigolets. We were in our car traveling west on a two mile stretch of road through this marshland. In this area it is quite dark and a good place to observe stars. I was pointing to the constellations for my sisters out the back car window when I noticed a star of the second magnitude moving from the S.W. to the N.E. The star was moving about 6 squares per minute if a paper ruled off in 1/4 in. squares were held 12 in. from a persons eyes.

It was going in a straight line. I observed it intensively for about 20 seconds during which time it stopped and stood still,looking exactly like the surrounding stars. 5 seconds or so later I saw another light of equal brightness and size. This one was coming from the N.E.,same speed and the same slowing and stopping. It stopped about two squares from the first star. This measurement is on the same scale as the speed measurements. After the second star had stopped a third appeared coming from the N.N.W.at the same speed,brightness,etc.of the first two. It

Extract from message on sighting:

A UFO was sighted on 3 July at 2340Z in the Antartic by three separate stations, Argentina, British and Chillean. The object was observed about forty-five degrees above the horizon heading East at an estimated distance of six to eight miles. The UFO was predominantly red and green in color, with yellow, blue, orange, and white reflectors and was visible for 15 or 20 minutes; sixteen or more chileans observed the sighting and were able to take ten photographs, the Argentines also photographed the object and promised the Air Attache copies of the photography. The argentine station at Orcadas Del Sur reported that the object affected instruments used for measuring magnetic fields. Additional information will follow when available.

while and orange shades. The object was
moving on a zigzagging trajectory toward
the east, but several times it changed
course to the west and north with varied
speeds and no sound. It passed at an
elevation of 45 degrees over the horizon,
distance estimated at about 10 to 15 kilo-
meters from the base.

"During the maneuvers performed by
the object, the witnesses were able to
register its tremendous speed and also
the fact that it hovered motionless for
about 15 minutes at an estimated alti-
tude of about 5 thousand meters. The
meteorological conditions for the area of
the sighting can be considered as very
good for this time of the year: clear sky,
some stratus-cumulus, moon in the last
quarter and perfect visibility.

"The sighting was witnessed by the
meteorological together with 13 members
of the garrison and 3 Chilean subolficers
visiting the base. The observation lasted
for 20 minutes and photographs of the
object were taken.

"In the afternoon of the same day the
same object was observed from the Ar-
gentine base on the South Orkney Is-
lands, moving away toward the north-
west, elevation 30 degrees over the hori-
zon, distance estimated at about 10 to
15 kilometers. The Chilean base also ob-
served the object referred to above on
the afternoon of that same day." Un-
quote.

The Argentine base on the South Or-
kney Islands is the oldest observatory in
the Antarctic region and has been in
continual operation since 1905. Contin-
ual records of terrestrial magnetism are
obtained there, several instruments be-
ing used such as variometers Eschen-
hagen, magnetometers Kew and terres-
trial Inductors Schulze. Several of those
instruments were working when the ob-
ject was sighted over the area. A great
scientific evidence has been given in Ar-
gentina to the registrations taken by
those instruments because the presence
of the strange object in the sky on July
3 produced disturbances in the magnetic
field—registered on the magnetographic
tapes. According to authorized sources
from the Argentine Navy Ministry, the
visual observation of the phenomenon
lasted for 20 minutes while the instru-
ments at that base registered the pres-
ence of the UAO for about one-hour and
two minutes.

On July 9, the Argentine Navy Secre-

tary released a second official report to

confirm the previous information on the
sighting of an unidentified aerial object
in the skies of the Antarctic region. This
second report is the following:

"Contacts were made with the Com-
mander of the Navy garrison on Deep-
tion Island. This officer, Lieutenant
Daniel Perisse, confirmed the accuracy
of his first report explaining that he
had only described what had been ob-
served by all the personnel under his
command. He again affirmed that the
object sighted was as bright as a first
magnitude star, was moving to the east
with varied speeds, hovered in midair
and stopped several times, to follow its
trajectory with sudden accelerations and
changes in course. The characteristics of
the object and its speed permit the affirmation that it was not a star, a weather balloon or an airplane. Seventeen
persons observed the strange object, including three Chilean subolficers from
the Aguirre Base who were on Deception Island.

"Concerning the attempts to photograph the object, Lieutenant Perisse informed that the circumstances were not
favourable to obtain good photos due to
several negative factors including the
low sensitivity of the film used, the distance and the darkness at the time of
the observation.

"On the other hand, information from
the Navy garrison at South Orkney Islands confirms a fact of extreme
importance: during the passage of the
strange object over that base two variometers working in perfect condition registered disturbances in the magnetic
field which were recorded on their
tapes." Unquote.

The Chilean Report
The Ministry of Defense in Santiago,
Chile, released to the press on July 7
the contents of reports received from
the Pedro Aguirre Cerda base on the occasion of unidentified aerial objects.
The messages had been sent by Commander Mario Janh Barrera, the C.O. at
that Base and were transmitted via radio.
The first observation was made on June
13 and reported as follows:

"I have to report that today, at 4:00
P.M. (local time) was sighted from this
base an aerial object luminous intensely
first magnitude star, appearing east of
the island at 60 degrees elevation, changing direction, to the left, in a 180 degree
turn to the west and then turning 90
degrees to the right; moving way to
the south following an irregular trajectory at 4:20 P.M. Meteorological conditions good, dark sky. The phenomenon
was observed by all the garrison. Avello

16.40 40Z." Unquote.

The second report, however, was the
most interesting:

"Sergeant Noya, in the course of meteorological observations on July 3,
spotted the presence of an aerial object
of the garrison for 20 minutes by nine members
of the garrison. Red-yellow luminosity,
changing colours, elevation 45 degrees,
crossing the island at SW in a NW-SE
course, luminosity first magnitude star.
Good conditions of visibility. Communication the same day, at 20:30 hours
(local time) with English base revealed
that on July 2, at 19:45 hours, five members of that garrison had sighted celestial object north of the island, moving
in a zigzagging course, stopping in midair for 5 or 10 minutes and disappearing
in a vertical direction. Red-yellow colours, changing to green, elevation 20 degrees and brightness first magnitude
star."

"Communication with the Argentine
base Deceplion Island disclosed that on
July 3 sixteen persons, including three
Chilean subolficers, had observed an
aerial object over the northern area of
the island, moving in a NNE direction,
varying speed, oscillatory course, changing yellow-green-orange colour, leaving
a contrail at 30 degrees elevation. Roundshaped, disappearing into cirrus clouds.
Was tracked by theodolites and highpowered binoculars. Corporal Duran,
from this garrison, took 10 colour photographs through the theodolite. Still on
the same day, in the Argentine base at
Orkney Island, two meteorological observers sighted an aerial object flying
at high speed on a parabolic trajectory
course E-W, while luminously, causing
disturbances in the magnetic field registered on geomagnetic instruments with
patterns notably out of the normal.

"There were no previous communications between the bases listed above that
could produce a psychosis of this kind
of observation—which must be of great
interest for scientific organizations interested." Unquote.

As soon as the reports were transcribed
above were released to the press, reporters from the Brazilian and Chilean
newspapers requested a direct interview
with Commander Mario Janh Barrera.
He was contacted by radio through Commander Jose Berdichevski, chief of Public Relations, Chilean Air Force, from
the AF radio-operations center in Santiago. He reported the following.

"It is nonsense to say that we saw a
flying saucer. It was something like a
fiction stories. What we sighted was
something real, a solid object which was
moving at incredible speeds, performed

Lens-Shaped Flying Object Seen In Antarctic

SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — From the Antarctic yesterday came an official report of a mysterious lens-shaped object moving at great speed.

A Chilean base commander at the Argentine Antarctic base saw the object that was "yellowish red, changing to green, yellow and orange."

In Buenos Aires, the Navy issued a communique saying personnel at an Argentine base saw the flying object and made no noise whatever.

Mario John Bacerra, commander of the Chilean base, told the defense ministry by radio that it would be too much to say "all of us saw a flying object," but he continued, "there was something real."

An object, stopped and we promptly reached for field glasses, telescopes anything at hand to sight it.

"I can say it was not a star," Bacerra said. "From what I know about aircraft there is nothing like it because of its shape, speed, and maneuverability."

SCIENTISTS IN ANTARCTICA SEE AND PHOTOGRAPH UFO. On July 3rd, scientists at three different Antarctic bases - British, Chilean, and Argentine - saw a "frightening speed" UFO that moved around in the sky for about twenty minutes in a zigzag fashion, shaped like a convex lens, and made no noise whatever. The object, according to the report, it finally disappeared at an altitude of six to ten miles.

Mario John Bacerra, a Chilean scientist at the base, stated that it most have had something to do with electronic or magnetic equipment. He also stated that photographs were taken of the object with electronic equipment. However, the pictures could not be available till March of 1966, because the base has no facilities for developing color film, and the photographs will have to be developed after his tour of duty is over.

Said Commander John Bacerra, in making his official reports "I belong to this, either in shape, speed, maneuverability or other characteristics, a total of at least eleven reliable witnesses were involved in this sighting." A similar sighting over the same area occurred about two weeks earlier.

ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
NEW YORK, JULY 20 (AP)--SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE
SEEING MORE THAN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE WING.

FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING
OBJECTS ZIPPING THROUGH SPACE AND, IN SOME REPORTED CASES, INTERFERING
WITH ELECTRONIC MAGNETIC EQUIPMENT.

AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN PAST
TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNEXPLAINED.

BUT A CLUING OBJECT THAT CAUSED A COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO
MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT ARE THESE OBJECTS?

THE AIR FORCE, WHICH HAS LOOKED INTO 9,127 REPORTED SIGHTINGS
TO DATE SINCE 1947, SAYS THEY'VE USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS, SEARCHLIGHTS,
JET EXHAUSTS--OR THE RED AND WHITE KITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
CHILD.

TO DATE, THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, AND
MOST OF THESE, IT SAID, COULD BE EXPLAINED AWAY IF MORE INFORMATION
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATING AGENCY, PROJECT BLUEBOOK
AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAYTON, OHIO.

THE AIR FORCE SAID ITS 18 YEARS OF INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE.
DISAGREEING WITH THE AIR FORCE IS MAJ. DONALD E. KEYHOE, A
RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

£852
THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND
SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME
ADVANCED CIVILIZATION," SAID KEYHOE.

KEYHOE CONTENDS THE AIR FORCE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION YEARS
AGO, BUT HAS A HIGH LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS NOT TO SCARE PEOPLE.

IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA HOLOCK, WIFE OF A
HER HUSBAND HAROLD, SPOTTED A FIERY OBJECT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR
WARMISTER, ENGLAND.

THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW
TAKING OFF FROM HIS FARM AN OBJECT THAT RESEMBLED A LARGE FOOTBALL.

WITH FOUR METAL LEGS, "WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," SAID AN OFFICIAL.
THE NEXT DAY THE CHILEAN AIR FORCE AND ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED
THAT CHILEAN, ARGENTINE AND BRITISH PERSONNEL IN ANTARCTICA SAW A
LENS-SHAPED OBJECT--YELLOWISH RED, CHANGING TO GREEN, YELLOW AND
ORANGE--THAT AFFECTED INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE MAGNETIC FIELDS.

OVER PORTUGAL AND THE AZORES JULY 10 MORE FLYING THINGS WERE
SEEN. THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING
OBJECT APPEARED OVER THE ISLAND AND THAT THE BUREAU'S ELECTROMAGNETIC
CLOCK STOPPED.

AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND
OTHER EXPERT AIRCRAFT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT
GLINTING IN THE SUN NEAR THE AIRPORT AT CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA. IT WAS
VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS
SENT AFTER IT.

ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS.
MRS. LAWRENCE FRAZIER SAID HER SONS, RONALD, 20, AND ROBERT 27,
SAW "PULSATING LIGHTS...SPREAD OUT OVER THE SKY." SHE SAID IT
"SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."

FLYING OBJECT
SIGHTED
IN ANTARCTIC
SANTIAGO, Thurs.
Chile's Department of
National Defence is checking reports today about a
strange object seen flashing in the Antarctic skies.

According to the reports,
the shiny object was seen on
July 3 by personnel of Chillan,
Argentine and British bases
in the Antarctic.

The Argentine Navy Ministry confirmed in a communique that a flying object was
seen and photographed in the
Antarctic by navy personnel
at bases here.

'Something real'
Mario Jahn Barrera, commanding one of the Chilean
bases, said it would be possible to say that "all of us
saw a flying saucer, one of
those scientific-fiction things.
It was a metallic, oval-shaped object that moved at
amazing speed, maneuvered
quickly and gave off a bluish green sheen. It also caused interference in the electromagnetic apparatus of an
Argentine base which is facing the coast."

Another object was yellowish
and changing to green, yellow,
and orange, he said. "It was
near, at an angle of 45 to
green from our position, over
the north end of the island."

"It would zigzag quickly.
Then it stopped and we promptly reached for field glasses,
telescopes, theodolites, any
optical instrument we could
we watched, as it remained
quietly there for about
20 minutes." -AP

Official Reports Describe
Flying Object in Antarctic
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP)—From the Antarctic yesterday came
official reports that a mysterious lens-shaped flying object,
concerning and moving at great speed, was sighted last Saturday.

A Chilean base commander in the antarctic reported the object was "yellowish red, changing to green, yellow and that moved at amazing speed,
maneuvered quickly and gave
off a blue-green sheen. It also
caused interference in the electronic apparatus of an Argentine base which is facing
one of its bases on an island.

In Buenos Aires, the navy
confirmed a communique saying the object was sighted at
the Argentine antarctic bases.

The interference was confirmed by the navy communications bureau in Buenos Aires.

Mario Jahn Barrera, commanding the defense ministry by
radio, said a control of the
"Harvey" he continued, "have the film developed in the
meeting real, an object mainland.

Australia "Visited" In March

Eight lights, each with long, red, incandescent tails, about 20 times the length of the head of the object, were observed by personnel at the Belfield Observatory in New South Wales on March 8, 1965.

UPI story claimed newspaper and radio station switchboards were jammed with calls from persons claiming they saw "flying saucers" over New South Wales. All reports said the objects were going from northwest to southwest at between 7:45 and 8 p.m. The Civil Aviation Agency and the Royal Australian Air Force said no planes were in the area when the sightings were made.

The Belfield group saw the objects almost directly overhead as they held their regional weekly meeting at the observatory, according to Director Gordon Patson.

Some of the astronomers theorized the sighting "may have resulted from movement of Jupiter in the evening sky."

maneuvers, emitted a greenish light and
caused interference in the electro-magnetic instruments of the Argentine base
situated close to ours, on a small island.

"Its red-yellow colour changed to
green and orange. It was flying at a
short distance from the base at an elevation of 45 degrees, over the north of
the island, and moving on a zigzagging
course.

"It hovered in mid-air after performing one of its maneuvers, remaining motionless for about 20 minutes and then
moving away at high speed. We observed this object through high-power binoculars and theodolites.

"I don't believe it could be an airship
of terrestrial manufacture. As an officer
of the Chilean Air Force, my knowledge
about man-made machines gives me absolute conviction that nothing similar
exists on earth in shape, velocity and
mobility in space. We have taken 10 colored photographs which will be developed in Santiago.

"As soon as we sighted the object we
tried to contact via radio the Argentine
and English bases. But such contact was
impossible because there was a very
strong interference on the radio — all
channels. With the radio useless and
under intense emotion we continued to
observe the thing in space, on a clear
night without winds . . ." Unquote.

4 July 3 1965, Antarctica. Argentine, British and Chilean military and scientific personnel observed a UFO for approximately 20 minutes. The UFO was reported "glowing with a white light cruising in a northeast-southwest direction at a high rate of speed." The UFO flew a zigzag course and seemed at times to hang suspended in the air. British personnel reported the UFO was green.

UFO SIGHTED IN THE ANTARCTIC

Argentine, British and Chilean military and scientific personnel in the antarctic watched what they called a curious celestial body for about 20 minutes on Monday, July 5, 1965.

Air Force headquarters released a copy of a report from the Air Force commander at Pedro Aguirre Cerda base in the antarctic saying that personnel there saw an object "glowing with a white light cruising in a north-east-southwest direction at a high rate of speed. The report said the object turned, flew a zigzag course and seemed at times to hang suspended in the air.

UFO INVESTIGATOR

Chile, Argentina
Confirm UFO Films

In official public statements, Argentina and Chile have solidly nailed down the existence of UFO color pictures taken at their Antarctic scientific stations. Adding to earlier press stories, the Secretary of the Argentine Navy confirmed these details:

On July 3, a tight lens-shaped flying object was seen, tracked and photographed at the Argentine scientific base, Deception Island in the Antarctic. Lt. Daniel Perise, C.O., confirmed by radio that the large UFO alternately hovered, then accelerated and manoeuvred at tremendous speeds. While being tracked by theodolite and watched through binoculars, the unknown object caused strong interference with variometers used to measure the earth's magnetic field, and also registered on magnetograph tapes. Color pictures were taken through a theodolite by a member of a visiting group from the Chilean scientific base.

Also confirming these points, the Chilean Minister of Defense at Santiago added new information radioed by Cdr. Mario Juan Barrera, C.O. of the Chilean base: On June 18, a similar UFO had manoeuvred over the area, seen by all personnel. During the July 3 sighting, the strange object has caused strong radio interference, temporarily blocking his attempts to report the UFO to the English and Argentina bases.

Other reported UFO photos not yet analyzed include pictures of:

Two bright cigar-shaped objects which manoeuvred over Buenos Aires on the night of July 16 and were seen by many witnesses.

A glowing UFO photographed near Shen, Texas, August 7, by TV cameraman Robert Campbell, Patrolman Peter McCollum was a witness and also observed the UFO. (This is the photo the Christian Science Monitor cited, rejecting the Air Force explanation).

A sharply maneuvered object, taken by highway accident Investigator Rex Heflin on August 3 in Orange County, California. The NICAP-Los Angeles sub-committee is investigating.

UAOs OVER ANTARCTICA

Shortly after the Valensole landing (see article this page) press wires hummed with the information that scientists at various Antarctica Bases had observed and photographed strange aerial objects.

Upon hearing this news, the Editor contacted Dr. Fontes and asked if he might have received any detailed information concerning the sightings. He responded with the following article:

The new wave of UAO sightings came, as expected, in July 1965. The frequency of observations has increased rapidly over the South American continent and West Europe, with a few scattered reports coming from the USA, Canada, North Africa and Australia. This report, however, will discuss only the first incidents at the beginning of the flap, which occurred in the Antarctic region of the planet. These incidents are very interesting because they caused such a reaction that two South American Governments were forced to release official statements on the subject. The sightings involved were reported from the Argentine, Chilean and English bases in the South American sector of the Antarctic region and hit the headlines all over the world.

The Argentine Reports
A solitary UAO was sighted from the Argentine base on Deception Island, on July 2, and appeared again on July 3 when it was also spotted from the Chilean and English bases located in the same area. The news about the sightings started rumors in Buenos Aires, arousing general interest. Under the pressure of public opinion and the press, the Argentine Navy Secretary released on July 6 an official statement with the following headline: "Observations of unidentified flying objects in the Argentine Antarctica." This Navy report is quoted below:

"The Navy garrison in the Argentine Antarctica (Deception Island) observed, on July 3, at 1940 hours (local time), a giant lens-shaped flying object, solid in appearance, colour mostly red and green, changing at moments, with yellow, blue,

Dear Hayden,

The following comments apply to the reported sighting by Gary Pinnell of San Antonio, Texas. Since the case has not been officially reported to the Air Force by the observer, it cannot be considered as part of the official Air Force case file. I can, however, give you a personal evaluation based only on the data which you have submitted on your form.

The duration of twenty-eight minutes was very confusing. Or course this duration would rule out such objects as satellites and aircraft which seemed logical from the general description.

A solution was not apparent until the diagram, following item #3, revealed that the object had vanished and reappeared over a telephone pole.

I have attached the ECHO I schedule for San Antonio, Texas. For the first object. The reported stopping of the object near stars is a frequent illusion associated with satellite and aircraft. In this case, it might be attributed to atmospheric conditions or an illusion created by the passage of one light near or over another light.

The second object with similar appearance to the satellites is possibly an aircraft. A further check with Gary should reveal then the duration of the first object, when first seen to its point of disappearance and then reappearance, and there should be a sufficient time lapse and duration of the second object to account for the twenty-eight minute total observation.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                                        7 July 1965

BY HARRY BUCK
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
NEW YORK - JULY 20 (AP)--SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE
SEEING MORE THAN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE WING.

FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING
OBJECTS ZIPPING THROUGH SPACE AND, IN SOME REPORTED CASES, INTERFERING
WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC EQUIPMENT.

AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST
TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNEXPLAINED.

BUT A GLOWING OBJECT THAT CAUSED A COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO
MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT ARE THESE OBJECTS?

THE AIR FORCE, WHICH HAS LOOKED INTO 9,127 REPORTED SIGHTINGS
TO DATE SINCE 1947, SAYS THEY'RE USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS, SEARCHLIGHTS,
JET EXHAUSTS--OR THE RED AND WHITE KITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
CHILD.

TO DATE, THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, AND
MOST OF THESE, IT SAID, COULD BE EXPLAINED AWAY IF MORE INFORMATION
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATING AGENCY, PROJECT
BLUEBOOK AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAYTON, OHIO.

THE AIR FORCE SAID IT IS 18 YEARS OF INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE.

DISAGREEING WITH THE AIR FORCE IS MAJ. DONALD E. KEYHOE,
RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

"THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND
SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME
ADVANCED CIVILIZATION," SAID KEYHOE.

KEYHOE CONTENDS THAT PEOPLE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION YEARS
AGO, BUT HAS A "HIGH LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS NOT TO SCARE PEOPLE."

THE SAUCER SEASON GOT OFF TO A FLYING START IN EUROPE JULY 7.
"IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA HORLOCK, WHO WITH
HER HUSBAND HAROLD, SPOTTED A FIERY OBJECT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR
WARMINSTER, ENGLAND.

THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW
TAKING OFF FROM HIS FARM AN OBJECT THAT RESEMBLED A LARGE FOOTBALL
WITH FOUR METAL LEGS. "WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," SAID AN OFFICIAL.

THE NEXT DAY THE CHILEAN AIR FORCE AND ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED
THAT CHILDREN, ARGENTINE AND BRITISH PERSONNEL IN ANTARCTICA SAW A
LENS-SHAPED OBJECT--YELLOWISH RED, CHANGING TO GREEN, YELLOW AND
ORANGE--THAT AFFECTED INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE MAGNETIC FIELDS.

OVER PORTUGAL AND THE AZORES JULY 16 MORE FLYING THINGS WERE
SEEN, THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING
OBJECT APPEARED OVER THE ISLAND AND THAT THE BUREAU'S ELECTROMAGNETIC
CLOCK STOPPED.

AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND
OTHER EXPERT AIRCRAFT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT
GLINTING IN THE SUN NEAR THE AIRPORT AT CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA. IT WAS
VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS
SENT AFTER IT.

ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS.
MRS. LAURENCE FRAZIER SAID HER SONS, RONALD, 20, AND ROBERT 27,
SAW "PULSATING LIGHTS, SPREAD OUT OVER THE SKY," SHE SAID. "IT
SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."
