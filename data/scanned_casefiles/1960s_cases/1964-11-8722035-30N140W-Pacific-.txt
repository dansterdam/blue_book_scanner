NOVEMBER 26, 1964       ECHO II

The image contains a table with multiple columns of numerical data, with the header "NOVEMBER 26, 1964" and "ECHO II" written above it. The table appears to contain time, location, and other numerical measurements, but due to the low image quality, some specific details are difficult to read precisely.
