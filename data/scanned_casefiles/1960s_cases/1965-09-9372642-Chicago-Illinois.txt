10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Will be evaluated if form 164 is returned.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers sighted a yellowish-green oblong object. At first it was stationary and then it moved very rapidly towards S/W. When the object moved it caused a reddish haze. The object seemed to have an outer stationary circle and an inner circle spinning clockwise.

Sounds like reflection or even possible a/c. If directional data is such that flights path consistent with duration.

The image appears to be a document with significant redaction (black lines covering text). While some text is visible, much of the document is obscured. The legible text is fragmented and difficult to fully read. Some words and partial sentences can be made out, but not enough to construct a complete narrative. The document seems to be from an official report, with some text visible at the top of the page, but the majority of the content is blacked out.

The party reporting this sighting impressed me as to being very young and not very familiar with aircraft. More than likely having witnessed an aircraft on an approach or takeoff from O'Hare International airport.

The only text I can clearly see on this page is "II 2927" in the bottom right corner of the document. The rest of the page appears to be blank or too faint to read.


- page 15 -

The text in the image is mostly illegible due to poor image quality. The only clearly discernible text appears to be partial words or fragments. 

The image contains three illustrations:
1. A top illustration showing a stick figure inside a curved dome or bubble with a wavy line above it
2. A middle illustration of a blank rectangular frame
3. A bottom illustration showing a stick figure pointing at something with a dotted line trajectory


- page 16 -

The text on this page is largely illegible. There is a postmarked stamp and what appears to be a postage stamp, but the text on them is too blurry to read clearly. The page seems to be a document or envelope page from a Project Blue Book file, but the specific details cannot be discerned from this image.
