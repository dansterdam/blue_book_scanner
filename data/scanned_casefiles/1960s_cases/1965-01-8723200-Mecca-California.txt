Dear Sir:

In reference to your letter of April 23, 1965, there is always a chance of a slip up somewhere. There is a possibility that I may have forgotten to put the correct address on the letter, and that I may have forgotten to put on a return. However, that is my loss, and not mine. I still have the transmegative. This negative was made before someone of finger prints on the slide.

In the past I have written many letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Washington 25 D. C. In as hope that I might slowly make their realize Heaven is not a myth. That I can promise you; those who direct the unidentified flying objects, know where the slides are, and why they are there.

NO CASE INFORMATION ONLY, 31 BD January 1965 ITALY

Hbrs Bmt/SAFOICC/T282/13 May 65

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Thank you very much for your recent letter regarding unidentified flying objects. I not only appreciate the delay in answering, but I am sure you will understand that the work involved in summarizing the many letters and analyzing and evaluating the many reports received in this office is very time consuming.

I am enclosing a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects. This report gives the official position of the Air Force on this subject.

In 16 years of investigating over 9000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved beyond reasonable doubt that all reported, radar, photo, and visual sightings either originated and were aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or the vehicle's own activity.

There has never been any evidence that UFOs reported to the Air Force represented extraterrestrial vehicles. No such object reported to the Air Force has given any indication of a threat to this planet nor has any evidence been presented that any unidentified flying object exhibited characteristics beyond the scope of current technical or scientific knowledge.

During the course of investigating UFO reports, it is often necessary to check air traffic, balloon launches, and weather reports. Due to the vast distances between our investigating offices and Blue, it would be extremely difficult for us to try to resolve your query.

I have been in touch with the Assistant Air Attache from Italy. He suggests that you contact someone at the following address with your queries:

29 January 1965

VIRGINIA SHERIFF WARNS AGAINST SHOOTING SPACE VISITORS: On January 29th, the sheriff of Augusta County, Virginia, said that he would crack down on local farmers who armed themselves in fear of "little green men". This warning came when the local Flap had reached near-hysterical proportions, headed by a report three days earlier by three small greenish-coated humanoid had been seen in the woods. "This thing has gotten completely out of hand," said the sheriff. "It is not dangerous to county residents. Anyone carrying firearms in the county without good reason will be dealt with according to the law."

AFDASCA/241

The following is a summary of letter dated 3 February 1965 and sent to "Project Blue Book" Information Officer, HQ USAF (SAF-OTRP), Washington, by Mr. [redacted] of [redacted] Rome, Italy.

"Mr. [redacted] describes himself as a 40-year old resident of Rome, a butcher by trade and for many years has been an amateur astronomer and owns a small telescope and a library full of books on the subject.

"The writer's sighting took place while visiting a cemetery in Verano at 11:30 a.m., Sunday, 31 January 1965. He describes a stationary luminous object which appeared in a clear sky and he immediately thought of and dismissed the possibility of its being a star or a planet due to its position in the firmament.

"After some moments a second object detached itself from the first and started spinning and circling around the first and then suddenly spurted away towards the west at an incredible speed.

"A third object detached itself from the original but did not circle about the first but sped away with astonishing velocity, also to the westward.

"The sighting perplexed him, and, as he states, although he has sighted strange objects at night, the daytime sighting concerning him and he eliminated the possible explanations, one by one.

"Mr. [redacted] calculates the height at 20,000 meters and the escape velocity of the objects at 5 times that of the "Echo" satellite. The direction of the spin of the original object was towards the north and the direction of departure flight of the second and third objects was from east to west."

A full translation of the letter can be furnished upon your request.

The document appears to be handwritten in what seems to be Italian. The text is densely written across the entire page, with cursive script that fills most of the page from top to bottom. While I can see the text clearly, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire text due to the complexity of the handwriting. Some words and phrases are legible, but a full transcription would require expert translation and deciphering of the handwritten script.

Attached is a color photo of a UFO submitted to this office for Air Force review and comment. It was taken 1530 to 1600 hours, 7 Feb 1965, about three miles east of the All-American Canal, east of Mecca, Calif., by Mr. Beaumont, Calif., telephoner. Mr. did not see the UFO but said he heard a rumbling thunder sound immediately after taking subject photo. He shot same with a 35 mm. Retina III single lens reflex camera, with 120 mm. telephoto lens, at 1/250th second, using Ektachrome X film. He estimated the object distance to be one-half to three-quarters mile from shooting point. Mr. said he found no evidence of subject object or blur on the film or immediately adjoining 35 mm. slide.

Can you please reply directly to Mr. on his UFO report and request for an opinion? Also would appreciate a copy of your reply for my file.

Incidentally, has a SAFOI Fact Sheet on UFOs been published since the one dated 19 Jan 1961? If so I also would like a copy and any other material available.

April 13, 1965

Chan T. Spaulding
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Dear Sir:

It is not my intention to fight many letters concerning the pictures of an unidentified flying object. However, there are a few things you might like to know.

It is not my intention to discount reports of little green people, nor little people, nor people from Venus or Rama. At the present time, I have no specific knowledge of them.

There may be objects of human relationship older, but the first people were put on this planet nine thousand one hundred years, seven hundred years, seven months, and twenty one days prior to this date. Heaven was set up, by the Great Council of the Universe, as an operational base, seven thousand one hundred and seven years, seven months, and twenty one days prior to this date. Adam walked out of the garden of eden six thousand nine hundred sixty three years, seven months, and twenty one days prior to this date. I was born round and to an orbit from this planet since Heaven was set up. Unidentified flying objects are not new to this world.

Heaven, eternity, and the Kingdom of God are governments, and they are populated with human beings. These governments operate by their methods, and remote control.

There are two forces around every planet. The magnetic force and the force of repulsion. It is the force of repulsion that keeps planets apart. The force of repulsion travels fast an straight. Light is slow relative to the force of repulsion. In the search for no more speed, these two forces are used by the ships of the Kingdom of God we are traveling twentythree thousand times the speed of light. Over two hundred thousand years ago the speed was reached twelve thousand times the speed of light. The Great Council have ships that travel sixteen hundred times the speed of light.

The only ones to worry now, the Kingdom of God are the evil, and corrupt governments. However, if the situation arose, the United States air force would be as vulnerable to these ships as a sitting duck in a shooting gallery.

Re: Unidentified Flying Object.                                                   April, 4 1965

Lt Colonel, John F Spaulding
Department of the Air Force

Mr Spaulding:

En closed are three slides. Nine was taken from the same location as ten. Eleven was taken a week later about one hundred miles north. At the first look these pictures I did not mark dates. Eleven must have been taken the seventh of February, and ten, and nine thirtieth of January.

Out of over a thousand the slide of the object, is the only one to get damaged. There is a streak across the top on the jell side, and a faint print in the corner. These I do not like. It should not be necessary to tell grown people to keep their fingers off the negative. I don't know whether the slides can be repaired or not.

For more information, you might contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Washington twentyfive D.C. I have written them about the pictures.

                                                                        Beaumont California
