AF Is Querying UFO Sighters

Two Air Force officers from Griffis Air Force Base, Rome, New York, are today, questioning people who have reported seeing flying objects in the Triple Cities areas of New York state in recent weeks, according to an Air Force release.

The investigation, scheduled night watching the heavens, and resulted in an Air Force report on several instances of UFOs sightings the number, location, types and movements of those seen, reports the release.

The investigation is being conducted by the Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, the release continued.

IN THE LAST 10 WEEKS GROUPS all over the country have reported seeing strange objects in the sky, usually at night. Most of the sightings have come from telephone line for the Air Force, in areas near military Bases, where unidentified objects have been looked up at the sky and seen speeding past.

Many citizens, said a Griffis spokesman have told their stories but that what they saw was not from this world, a spokesman said. Some of them insisted it is secret devices of the Soviet Union.

Daylight UFO sighting reported 

A Binghamton woman yesterday reported seeing a brilliant daylight UFO. This was the earliest reported since the night before, when the witnesses waited until 8:50 P.M. to make their report.

Mrs. Adelia C. Reed of 128 St. Clair Ave., Binghamton, told the Broome County Civil Defense director, Mr. Welch, that she observed the brilliant sighting at 7:20 a.m. yesterday.

"Two never seen anything like it before. It was not, according to her, a plane, balloon or any other natural phenomena."

The lady had a headache and was watching for the sighting to go over, which it finally did at 7:28 a.m.

Mrs. Adelia C. Reed further said that the object appeared to be round and metallic and made no sound. 

"We waited for it to come over this line twice before," she said. "That is when I got a better look at it."

Mrs. Grady H. Keller of Round Valley, Texas, was reported to the Valley Traffic Court, reporting seeing a bright light hovering over Pecos, Tex., in the early morning yesterday.

TEXT OUTPUT:

Plane trails 'flying saucer' in new report
By Hollis Klink 
of the Southern Tier Reporter
An unusual sighting of a strange flying object in the Southern Tier devel- oped new angles this week.
Officials at Griffin Air Force Base in Rome said they have confirmed that an unidentified flying object, described as "peculiar," was picked up on radar last Wednesday night. Peter Adshead, an official of the air base, said the base made the report.
"It was just weird," Dr. William Shinn, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, said. "There is no explanation for it."
Adshead said officials at the base picked up on radar a fast-moving object, and they tried unsuccessfully to contact it by radio. He said the object they tracked was not an airplane, and it was too fast to be a meteorite.
Adshead said the base is keeping files on the incident, but he admitted that "we have no idea what it was."
The sighting occurred about 10:30 p.m. last Wednesday, and the base officials said they ob- served the object for about 15 min- utes before it disappeared.
John Calabria, a city fireman who also is a member of the Broome County Astronomical Society, said he and several neighbors watched a strange object in the sky at the same time as the base's radar had it under observation.
"It didn't have any of the charac- teristics of a plane or a shooting star," Calabria said. "It was very, very bright."
Calabria said the object was visible for about a half-hour, and it did not have any of the normal characteristics of a conventional aircraft.

Another flying saucer?
Binghamton, New York - Last night's sighting of a flying 
object over Binghamton caused a new wave of UFO interest 
around here. The latest incident was reported by two 
youngsters who claimed they saw a flying saucer in the sky
about 7:15 p.m. last night. The boys, Philip Ross, 15, 
and Antonio Wingler, 14, residents of the Endicott-Johnson 
City area, said the object they saw was round and silvery
in color and that it hovered in the sky for a few seconds, 
then shot off at a terrific speed. Airport officials said
they had no reports of any unidentified craft in the area 
last night. So what did the boys see?

Flying what?
...What strange phenomena is observed in the sky above? 
Where did it originate? Did it actually leave the earth 
and return again? The answer is not known for certain 
but reports of "flying saucers" and other UFO's continue
to come in with alarming regularity...

The article mentions witness accounts, the Air Force's investigation into the sightings, and the general phenomenon of UFO activity in the region.

Air Force here to probe Tier sightings of UFOs

Air Force Capt. Richard T. Bierne and Maj. Sidney Fitch, assigned to the Aerial Phenomena Branch of the U.S. Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., are in the Binghamton, New York area investigating the recent sightings of unidentified flying objects in this region. The sightings have been widely reported and the Air Force is conducting an investigation.

The article describes the details of several recent UFO sightings, including witness accounts, the objects' movements and characteristics, and the Air Force's efforts to gather more information and investigate the incidents. It indicates that additional information will be forthcoming as the Air Force probe into the Tier sightings of UFOs continues.

The image contains a photograph of a UFO sighting report. The report is titled "Growing UFO Seen By Norwich Man" and describes the sighting of an unidentified object in the sky by a man in Norwich. The report includes details about the object's appearance and movement, as well as commentary from the witness. There is also a second article on the page titled "UFO Sighted" which provides additional details about a separate UFO sighting.

Firemen -- 
  "Norwich, at 8:15 p.m. on the evening of July 2, a group of firemen were working on a house fire on Coleville Road. According to their report, while fighting the fire they observed a strange object in the sky. Capt. Clarence Baker said that at first he thought it was an unusually bright star, but as he kept watching, he realized it was a moving object. He said it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and headed in a southerly direction. The firemen said the object was at an estimated height of about 2,000 feet and was visible for about 3 minutes."

UFO SIGHTED 
  SHERBURNE--An unidentified flying object was reportedly seen by two men while driving in a car between Sherburne and Norwich at about 9:30 p.m. on the night of July 2. According to the report, the men spotted a large brightly lighted object that appeared to be hovering about 50 feet from the ground over a field. They said the object was about 20 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it suddenly sped away at a high rate of speed and disappeared over the treetops.

BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK
JULY 9, 1964
1. On 9 July 1964, at approximately 2300 hours, the reporting individual, Mr. Robert W. Leland of 29 Oseroff Drive, Binghamton, New York, observed an unidentified flying object over his residence. 
2. Mr. Leland stated that the object was first noticed moving from southeast to northwest at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet. The object had three bright, steady lights on the underside and appeared to be oblong in shape. Mr. Leland maintained observation of the object for approximately 15 minutes.
3. The object suddenly increased in speed and altitude and disappeared from view. No sound was heard at any time.
4. Mr. Leland stated that he attempted to take photographs of the object but was unsuccessful. The two images provided represent the results of his efforts.
5. Based on the information provided, this sighting is evaluated as being most likely caused by an aircraft or satellite. The rapid increase in speed and altitude is not characteristic of a genuine unidentified flying object.

FLYING SAUCERS STILL LANDING: It seems that the giant 1964 saucer "Flips" is going to continue landing. Shortly after our September issue went to press, we received two more reports of close sightings and landings of these huge craft all over the country.
In the village of Gorham, near Rochester, New York, five children saw a landed craft and a smallish humanoid creature in mid-July. They tried to approach it but were frightened away. The visitor then went back into the craft and it rose silently and swiftly.
In the village of Goctle, near Binghamton, New York, a farmwoman was tending her vegetable garden one afternoon, when she noticed a huge metallic craft descending slowly within a few hundred feet of her. It hovered just above the ground for several minutes, then shot up vertically and disappeared. This incident occurred on July 9th, and the witness, still shaken by her experience, reported it to the local authorities. We have filed her report with the Saucer Center.

Glowing UFO Seen
By Norwich Man

A Norwich man engineered an object hovering in the air and watched it for about five minutes, according to a report received at state police headquarters.
The man, who was not identified, said he stopped and watched the object, which appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter, as it hovered over his daughter's camp where she was staying as a counselor. 
When he saw the object, he said he stopped and watched it for about five minutes. He estimated the object to be 25 feet in diameter and said it shined with an iridescent slow around the outer edge like a fluorescent light.
Then there were three flashes of light which "practically blinded me" when the object left.
The UFO was reported by the man in a call to state police at Sidney.

SKY SIGHTINGS IN FOCUS

The sky over the Triple Cities, to many persons a novelty, has become a commonplace of phenomena to the trained observers with binoculars. These persons, who have been known as a team of "sky watchers", have reported on their observations.

They were found to encounter objects of all types, some close and some distant, of many colors and shapes. Many of these were lights, some constant and some flashing, and some in groups of two or three.

Dr. Allen Hynek, chairman of the Astronomy Department at the Ohio State University and scientific consultant for the Air Force on "unidentified flying objects", has been quoted as saying that "their reports are of great value in assembling the total picture".

THEIR STATION WAS THREE HOURS STINT WITH SEVEN-TWENTY-EIGHT BINOCULARS: the astronomical observers reported nine airplanes including one large jet bomber with red and green lights, approaching to southwest to northeast. Also a fast jet, flying very high from west to east, and some other lights.

9:27 p.m. - Large jet bomber with red and green lights, approaching to southwest to northeast.
9:35 p.m. - Two jets flying very high from west to east.
9:43 p.m. - A bright red meteor, streaking through the sky in a southwesterly direction.
10:10 p.m. - An airplane circling near the northeastern horizon.
10:20 p.m. - A meteor, northwest to east.
10:27 p.m. - Two jets, southwest to northeast.
10:37 p.m. - A bright, pulsating, southeast to northwest.
10:40 p.m. - A very bright meteor, northeast to northwest.
10:45 p.m. - Echo I communications satellite, east to west, bright and high overhead.
10:51 p.m. - Another bright object, southwest to southeast.

TONIGHT, MR. BUDINE SAID, Echo I should be visible as a bright object from west to east from 9:35 to 10:55 and from 11:37 to 11:57.

There explosion was great, but possibly the size of one of those fat jet liners you see today. This thing may have had some type of force field around it that held it together, ONCE THE FORCE FIELD WAS BROKEN APART, IT EXPLODED. IT SEEMS THERE WAS MUCH MORE GROUND COVERAGE THAN ONE USUALLY HEARS ABOUT. MARTIN was plowing, and saw the thing suddenly explode. He was about 220 million miles from the Earth when this happened and was afraid to get any closer, don't ask me why, but he did not report it until HE WAS 150 FEET AWAY. His story checks out in every respect. The EARTH IS NOW a very difficult PLACE TO LIVE.

Reports of strange sky phenomena continued to pour in today from children and adults throughout Onondaga County. On the 10th some 15 telephone calls were received by the press, reporting some unusual sky happenings.
Officials at both Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, and Hancock Field in Syracuse, said today that they could throw no light on any of the reports or recent days.
Full J. BURLINGHAM, chairman of the Observing Section of the Astronomical Society of Onondaga County, made observations last night from his home in Jamesville. He said that he would identify what of the objects that were reported if they were seen again.
"At about 9:40 p.m., I saw a yellowish object move from the west to the southwest through my telescope. It seemed to be moving rapidly". If was the only object I could see, he said.
Mr. Burlingham said that he was using a 17-power eyepiece in his telescope.
Mr. Buddin also said that some of the happenings that might have seemed spectacular were in fact, natural phenomena. For instance, he said, there was a flight sighting at 10:35 p.m. with bright yellow lights, two objects crossing the sky at 10:13 p.m., and both I and Radio II.
A Murray Schoell was said to have been awakened from sleep last night upon hearing a rumbling south last night having northward. "All of a sudden it stopped," he said, and moved into a fixed position relative to the trees, remaining there for three hours.
He said that the object which he described as "multicolored-changing from red to white with a roundish tint to it" never left its position.

Text found in the document:

It was about 10:15 p.m., and remained fixed in relation to nearby stars until 1:15 a.m.
At about 10:15 p.m., he said he saw a plane approach the object through his binoculars. He said that the plane, which was in "line of sight with the object", was flying south of Binghamton, from east to west. The plan said he could see the outline become very bright, about 11:15 p.m., and that the man on duty also caught sight of the object.
He also reported that he telephoned back to the radar control area to advise them to look for the object. But the object disappeared while he was still on the phone, and was not detected by the radar equipment.
He said that he lost sight of the plane shortly afterwards. The object moved from the observer's left to right about 11:15 a.m., when it disappeared behind Ely Park Hill.
The public information officer at Rome suggested the the sighting base would be ably to supply more information if an investigator would come to the base. Lt. Winlant Harold, an information officer at the Hancock base, said that he knew of no reports of this phenomenon. However, that he would be informed of the incidents by residents who report having seen unusual objects. Most reports last night said a "bright moving object" was sighted at various hills are reported to have seen something which was red and green and cone shaped. They said no noise was emerging from the object.
A Broad Street woman also reported the phenomena to be red and green. The reports began to come in at 9 p.m. and continued until 2:30 a.m. There were several reports of an object observed over Binghamton. An 87-year-old resident, who lives on Broad Street, said that she and her brother saw an object with a triangular shape (previous was a quotation) about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday. She said that it couldn't have been an airplane.

"Persons became at me a funny sound."
John Hroncich, 11 of Seven Wilson Street is reported to have seen "a bright sliver in the sky" that was shining very brightly about 3:50 a.m.
As official at the Broome County Airport Tower said that the Hroncich's observation sounded like an aluminum reflection seen in the sky.
Monday night three Norwich residents said that they saw strange skyborn phenomena near Binghamton on this night between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.
"In a report published in 1952, the U.S. Air Force said that the only "flying saucer" is that concealed in spare parts on earth.
"Of the 426 investigations begun in 1963, 426 were completed. The report said that these investigations have brought to light a number of investigations.
The report said that the Air Force has yet to come up with any evidence that flying saucers exist or that that unidentified objects were manned.
Another 17 year old Binghamton girl said that she saw something that looked like "a satellite" she came to the conclusion that it was some of the strange youngsters in the night sky.
Mrs. Edmond Travis, of Voodside Avenue, mother of the children who said that they saw a spaceman, and her younger daughter living in the house where the space vehicle is reported to have landed. The noise in the area is reported to have been loud and unusual.
Mrs. Travis said that she and her husband were not telling the truth about what they had seen because of the punishment in them.
She said that she believed what the boys had told her because they had not changed their story even in the face of punishment.

UPON NO LAUGHING MATTER !!!

TO the editor:

One other remark there was a news report about an unidentified flying object landing near Binghampton.John saw it as another "flying saucer" landing, and I think on this subject, I checked the general reaction was a somewhat frivolous on the subject.

I feel nothing wrong with people disagreeing with the subject, was brought up without thinking when the subject of "flying saucers" was broached.

The American public has been too conditioned to laughing at the subject - thinking objectively and seriously about the subject. I believe that in spite of those who ridicule and those who accept this phenomenon without any sort of life capable of traversing interstellar space to planet or even from sun to sun, there must be some sort of life capable of traversing interstellar space.

It is more than written and spoken about this subject to make the general public more aware of the subject so that they can make up their own minds objectively and with careful and rational thought.

SUBJECT:

13 August 1954

Investigation - Reported Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)

To: AF 22 (CORD)
Detachment ARS, USAF, Ohio 55433

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2, a detailed investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) reported in the Binghamton, New York area, on 7 August 1954, has been completed and the following report submitted.

2. On 7 August 1954, at approximately 8:30 P.M., a citizen of Binghamton, New York, reported observing several unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the sky over Binghamton. The information was relayed to this headquarters, and a preliminary investigation was immediately initiated.

3. On the basis of personal interviews and other information gathered, the following details have been ascertained:

a. In June, a farmer in Nanticoke Valley near Binghamton, reported a close sighting of several such objects. This incident was given much publicity and eventually started the sequence of events leading to the present report.

b. In early July, five children in the town of Endicott, also reported seeing a formation of glowing objects in the sky. This incident was also given some publicity.

c. On 27 July, two housewives in Vestal, N.Y. sighted an object which they described as silver, disc-shaped, and approximately 60 feet in diameter. This investigation seemed to be reasonable, and the report was forwarded to higher headquarters.

d. On 6 August, a Binghamton resident reported seeing a large, glowing, spherical object in the sky which seemed to hover for a few minutes and then disappeared. This report triggered a rash of reports. The mass bulletin was widely disseminated, and a great number of reports came in from citizens who seemingly were looking for such objects.

e. The details of these and similar reports have been carefully sifted and analyzed. While it is difficult to deny the possibility that some unusual aerial phenomena were actually observed, the bulk of the reported sightings appear to be the result of misidentification of conventional objects and faulty observational reports. It is the considered opinion that the reported sightings do not constitute evidence of the existence of unconventional aerial vehicles.

6. It is requested that this report be considered CONFIDENTIAL and should be discussed on a need-to-know basis only.

(Redacted) 
By Interview obtained a great number of reports during
this investigation.

the period 30 July to 3 August.  These reports consisted mostly of light sightings. None of the reports seemed to be reliable.  The investigators were unable to determine the nature of information.

Mr. J. L. RYAN, the amateur sky watcher, stated that an object was sighted on 25 July for about 10-15 minutes with binoculars and other aids.  He reported a light or illumination all around the object.

Personnel and Weather Bureau personnel at Tioga County Airport reported seeing an unusual object during the period 25 July to 3 August.

Newspaper clippings from The Bun Bulletin and Binghamton Evening News are included as attachments.

Items and 5 narrative are included as attachments.  These items do not appear to corroborate any of the sightings shown on the point.  The investigators feel that this is an unreliable report and that this should be filed for information.

The maps of the Binghamton and Tioga area are included as attachment 6.
