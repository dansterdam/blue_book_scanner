11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object had flashing red, green, and white lights that would fade then brighten. A contrail was observed in the sky as the object approached from the east. A roaring sound was heard being similar to that made by a jet aircraft.
One investigator drew an East-West type holding pattern used by aircraft over a navigational aid and first witness said this was similar to movements made by the object.

FAA reported no air traffic was in the particular area during the sighting however the FAA only keeps a record of those aircraft that file an IFR flight plan. Aircraft flying over the area that do not file an IFR with the FAA is watched but a record is not kept of the aircraft, thus the FAA would not have a record.
