NEW YORK, N.Y. 10022

April 26, 1966

Dear Sirs:

In light of the discussion concerning UFO's, and with a certain amount of diffidence, I feel I should make this report. I certainly do not have an explanation.

On Friday, April 22, 1966, I was driving north on Route 22 N.Y. heading for Bennett College to visit my wife's sister. At about 7:15 P.M., I was around Mingdale and throughout this period, I was probably driving about 35 or 40 m.p.h. It was dusk and although a crescent moon could be seen then or shortly after, the sky was still quite light. There is a hill to the east and woods to the west of the road.

I saw a blue-green ball of light moving fairly rapidly, low, horizontally in the sky from east to north or east to west. I could tell distance and at first thought it was a ball like those that are short from Roman candles. I looked for another fire work display but there was none and the ball didn't fade out but continued to move. I then noticed a triangle of white light in an exhaust area of the ball and thought I must be seeing some sort of comet with a trail. It was either quite close or moving very rapidly now above the road ahead of me. Then it seemed that the white trail light became suddenly brighter and disappeared. At that point the green light started to come down in the angle of a plane on its final descent. I saw another light of the same color seem to move slightly ahead of the other and then it was behind the trees as though it had landed. I never saw any flying object â€” only these lights. As I drove on, I realized that I didn't know what it was.

I couldn't find a nearby landing field on the charts I looked at over the weekend and also realized that had it been a plane, the light on that wing would have been red.

Very truly yours,

JLC/lk
