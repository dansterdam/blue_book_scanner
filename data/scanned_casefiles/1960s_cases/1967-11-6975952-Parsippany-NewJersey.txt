11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
    boys have seen several UFO sightings in the past. No one reported any such object to the Parsippany police department. Although the image in the photo cannot be specifically identified, it appears that the sighting is a hoax and the photo of some small man made object.

    The observer sighted and photographed an object that looked like two paper plates with a dome. The object made a humming noise and "animals were barking."

Existence of Extraterrestrial Flying Saucers

Parsippany, New Jersey 07054

Dear Mr [redacted]

This replies to your letter dated 10 Jan 1969. I do not share your concern with regards to the existence of extraterrestrial flying saucers. To date I have received absolutely no evidence which would convince me that flying saucers are real. There is also no concrete proof that extraterrestrial life exists at Alpha Centauri or any other planet or star in the Cosmos. If you have positive proof that flying saucers exist, then I am sure that the National Academy of Sciences would be most grateful if you would supply them with this information.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr, Lt Col, USAF

Dear Major:

I am writing this letter in deep concern about the subject U.F.O.'s. I have been dealing with the subject for quite some time. I would suggest that you continue U.F.O. investigation. I guarantee I can supply sufficient information and evidence proving the fact that Flying Saucers do exist, and that we are being observed by an advanced civilization from outer space, possibly Alpha Centauri. Please answer this letter as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

RLT:do

This letter rec. 19 Jan.

Dear Sirs,

Mr. and my friend are investigating flying saucers. We have been studying the flying saucers for 2 year now. And I have proof that flying saucers and aliens exist on earth. I have seen saucers land and I got pictures of them to prove this point.

I took the picture at night with a polaroid survey camera. The date was November 12, 1967. Here is the story: I went out to the quiet area near my mother. Around 20 seconds later I heard a humming noise over my house. I looked up and saw an object with as dome on it. It was standing still, then I realized it was a flying saucer. I ran upstairs and got the camera and I took the pictures. Here is an example below:

P.S. Please write back.

Thank you very much,

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

DATE OF REPORT 11 December 1968

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Lake Parsippany, New Jersey DATE 12 November 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF IR QUALITY Poor
P NRS

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 68-50 in which Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla (TQP) requested identification of an object photographed at Lake Parsippany, New Jersey by (age 13) using a Polaroid "Swinger" camera.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of submitted photograph and an enlargement of same has failed to reveal the identity of the object in question. Although the imagery appears to be genuine, the extreme contrast of the light colored object and the dark background does not lend itself to interpretation as to configuration and size of the image. Interpretation is further hampered by sources conflicting statements as to the size of the object when compared to that of known objects held at arm's length. i.e. from that of a half match head to a diameter of a dime. Utilizing such information can at best indicate the object (based on the nominal focal length of the "Swinger" lens) to be on the order of perhaps one inch to 33 feet in length. A resume of the furnished information and resultant photographic analysis, produced no satisfactory explanation of the nature of the object (image).

3. No satisfactory explanation of the nature of the object (image) can be made at this time from information supplied.

Dear Sir;

I have written to you once before about the topic of flying saucers. I am writing you this letter because I have seen two more, flying saucers is my hobby, and having seen them again I believe even more than before. I have seen it with the same person. His brother saw it too.

I know you might make this as a hoax, but can you send me another form and I will give you as much information as possible. There was a jet next to the saucers. If you get any reports of U.F.O.'s near or around a jet in north Jersey that will be the one. Believe me, it's no hoax.

Thank you,
