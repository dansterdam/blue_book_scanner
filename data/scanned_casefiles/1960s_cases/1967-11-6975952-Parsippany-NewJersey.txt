3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NATURE OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 20 Second

7. COURSE: NNE to E
8. PHOTOS: Yes
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes
10. CONCLUSION: UNKNOWN OTHER (SMALL MAN MADE OBJECT)
Visual: Other (HOAX)
The observer and a friend also saw the object. The witness' parents saw it. The parents of the boy denied having seen any UFO on 12 Nov 1967. Both boys have seen several UFO sightings in the past. No one reported any such object to the Parsippany police department. Although the image in the photo does not definitively identify the object, the photograph is a hoax and the photo of some man made object.
The observer sighted and photographed an object that looked like two paper plates with a domed shape. The object made a humming noise and "animals were barking."

Dear Mr. _____,

This replies to your letter dated 10 Jan 1969. I do not share your concern with regards to the existence of extraterrestrial flying saucers. As you have undoubtedly noticed, the claims that extraterrestrial life exists at Alpha Centauri or any other planet or star in the cosmos - if you have positive proof that flying saucers exist, then I am sure that the National Academy of Sciences would be most grateful if you would supply them with this information.

This matter rec. 18 Jan.
Dear Sir:
The writer and my friends are investigating flying saucers. We have been studying the flight of saucers for a year now, and I have proof that flying saucers and saucer-like craft exist on earth. I have seen saucers land and and I got pictures of them to prove it.

I took the picture at night with a polaroid camera, the date was November 12, 1967. Here is the story: I went out to check on some things. I noticed no seconds later a humming noise. There was a large, round, flat object hovering about 150 feet above the ground. It was still, then I realized it was a flying saucer. I ran upstairs and got the camera and I took the picture. This was an example believe -

The image appears to show a grainy, black and white photograph. The central area of the image is mostly obscured or damaged, leaving a faint, indistinct shape or outline that could be the remnant of some type of object or structure. However, the overall image quality is poor, and no clear or definitive details can be discerned from the photograph.

TEXT OUTPUT:
The object referred to in the report was observed by the witness, Anthony Amato, on November 6, 1967 at approximately 6:25 PM in Parsippany, New Jersey. The witness reported seeing a circular, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky for several minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared. The object was described as being approximately 40 feet in diameter, with a metallic, reflective surface. No other details about the object's appearance or behavior were provided in the report.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 68-19
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 11 December 1967
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Lake Parsippany, New Jersey
DATE: 12 November 1967
PHOTOGRAPHY: IR QUALITY: POOR
1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 68-50 in which Lieutenant Colonel (USAF) requested identification of an object photographed at Lake Parsippany, New Jersey by___ (age 13) using a Polaroid "Swinger" camera.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of submitted photograph and an enlargement of same has failed to reveal any identifiable object in question. Photographic imagery appears to be indistinct, blurred and lacking in detail to permit interpretation as to configuration and size of the image. Interpretation is further hampered by excessive contrast in the negative as to the object when compared to the background.
Objects held at arms length - i.e. from that of a half match head to the diameter of a dime - Building structures, information can at best indicate the object (image) appears one inch in length. Examination of the furnished information and results of photographic production no satisfactory explanations can be determined.
3. No satisfactory explanation of the nature of the object (image) can be made at this time from information supplied.

OCR output:

Dear Sir:
I have written to you once before about the topic of flying saucers. I am well aware that this letter may be considered a hoax, because I have seen them again and I believe even more than before.
It has been at least three months since I have seen it with my own eyes. His brother saw it at the same time, but we have seen it with our own eyes. I know you might mark this as a hoax, but can you send this to another form and I will give you as much information as possible. There was a jet next to the saucer. I could clearly see the markings on both sides of it and it seemed to be about 50 feet in length. I beg and pray that will be the one. believe me, it's no hoax.

Thank you
