7. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Multiple objects observed described as a high fast moving A/C, Orbiting Satellite, a low altitude slow moving light. One object tracked on Radar.

Radar track was of an object approximately 7 miles NW of Pease AFB tracked to a position of 2 miles NE, indicating SE flight and regarded by the Watch supervisor as a light A/C.

On the night of 24 Aug the Satellite ECHO was observed and SE, Northerly, Stationary and considered identical to one of the objects observed on the night of 20 August.

The object observed by Tower personnel with BK at 110 deg azimuth and disappearing at 310 deg azimuth 3 minutes later is regarded as ARCTURUS. Disappearance reported as instantaneous and motion Northerly slow. This object characteristic of an Astro report.

The rest of the document appears to be a technical diagram with gridlines, numbers, and what seems to be a temperature and altitude/height graph with various plotted points and lines. The right side of the document contains vertical bar-like graphical elements. Due to the technical nature of the diagram, most of the small numerical annotations are difficult to transcribe precisely.

a. Time and date of sighting.

g. See attachment 1.

h. See attachment 2.

i. Identification or Identification Action Taken.

(1) A KC-97 aircraft flying locally was asked to observe the UFO or identify it. The crew reported nothing sighting.

j. N/A.

k. Conditions of preparing officer: Major Charles W. Martz, 1st Operations Officer, Rouse Air Force Area New Hampshire.

Comments: I am convinced the observers did see an unusual light. The light was described in various manner ranging from "possibly a light, fast moving aircraft", "a critical satellite", "the low altitude slow moving light". The target tracked by the GCA radar could easily move between 5 light to 7 knots. The statement of the A/C atch supervisor on the tower operator confirmed the direction of travel, i.e., watch supervisor.

Here is the text from the document:

"raced a PO on radar from a position approximately seven miles northwest of base to a position approximately two miles northwest." 

"this indicates a coordinate track. no other states that his visual sighting "appeared to move very slowly to the north". the statement of weather conditions indicates such conditions were such that anomalous propagation could easily exist."

"At 0l052, 25 August 1965, the echo satellite was visible and pre-plotted several network from airmen working on the flight line. One of these airmen stated to me that "there is, that's the same thing we all saw last Friday night". I have observed the echo satellite numerous times and am certain that it was what we saw that time."

"In conclusion, I believe that these sightings were nothing more than the convergence of the echo satellite by persons who did not recognize it as such. the radar sighting, as previously noted, did not bear out the same track and was undoubtedly a light aircraft on a PO flight."

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, 1LT Robert H. Kessler, Watch Supervisor RAPCON, on 20 August 1965 at about 2350L tracked a UFO on radar from a position approximately seven miles Northwest of Pease to a position approximately two miles Northwest of Pease. The radar return was good, and appeared to be the size 110 p light aircraft would produce. Speed was slow to moderate and sporadic at times. The Control Tower had visual contact with the object. At about 2345L another target similar in size and speed was observed to follow the same track. Speed was steady. Tower did not acknowledge visual sighting. At approximately 0000L a KO-97 was vectored to the area but observed nothing unusual. Boston Center was contacted and reported no aircraft under their control were in that vicinity at the time of the sighting. There were no further sightings by Tower or RAPCON.

SUMMARY OF WEATHER CONDITIONS

The following were the weather conditions from 2300L 20 August 1965 to 0100L 21 August 1965 at and in the vicinity of Pease Air Force Base.

1. Winds aloft over PSH (estimated):
   5,000' 300/10   39,000' 220/20
   10,000' 260/30   40,000' 270/30
   11,000' 250/30   50,000' 260/50
   20,000' 230/50

2. Surface observations at PSH (local daylight saving time)
   2300L Clear 30   61/50 3107 008 3c 5
   0000L Clear 30   61/49 3606 009 207 30
   0100L Clear 30   55/49 0000 011

3. There were no Thunderstorms in the area.

4. The average vertical temperature gradient from the surface to 8500' was 3 deg C/1000'. (see attached skew T log P diagram)

5. The following is a summary of the weather and atmospheric conditions in the vicinity of Pease Air Force Base on the night of 20 August 1965.

A ridge of high pressure existed to the west of Pease with general direction of wind bent towards the east. Skies were generally clear with a scattered layer of stratus in the area. Winds distributed within the hour prior to this period were light and variable. The atmosphere was based at about 5500'. Thin broken clouds were noted at 5000' and on the horizon. Visibility was good with no restrictions on the low horizon at the time of this writing. This is true over PSH region. A low unstable layer existed between the surface and 8500'. A gradual inversion layer was noted between 8500' and 9500'. The combination of the above ingredients would indicate that no serious material would be suspended at any great height west of PSH as well as in the local area. Due to the composition of the atmosphere that night, light sources and reflective objects or light sources could have shown up to or below the base of the inversion.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, AIC James A. Gray, AF14631462, did observe on the night of 27 August 1965 at approximately 2330 local a UFO Northwest of Pease Air Force Base as to the altitude and distance they were hard to determine. The object appeared to move very slowly to the North. The object was observed for approximately one half (½) hour then disappeared. In coordinating with the RAPCON it was determined radar was picking up a UFO in the vicinity.

Bottom of Page:

The majority of the page appears to be a complex grid/chart with various numerical notations and diagonal/intersecting lines. There is also a text section on the right side of the page, but the text is too small and blurry for me to confidently OCR without potentially introducing errors.

The bottom right of the page contains what looks like a form with multiple rows and columns, but again, the text is too small to reliably transcribe.
