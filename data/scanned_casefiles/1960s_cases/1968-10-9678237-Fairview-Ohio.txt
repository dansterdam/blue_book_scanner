27. In the following drawing shown, there are two lines connected. These are marked "A" and "B" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "A" the same curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "B" the same curved line to show the compass direction that you first saw it. Place on "A" the same curved line to show the compass direction that you last saw it.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" the beginning of the path, the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text provided below the diagram appears to be handwritten notes or observations related to the diagram and instructions.

Transcribed text:
The objects approached over Fairview according to the observer very slowly and without noise. They hovered close enough to permit a good observation. Two elongated shaped objects, one about twice the size of the other, with a distinct oval shape. They appeared to be metallic and glowed with a reddish-orange color. There was no visible means of propulsion and no other unusual features were observed. The objects remained in the area for a few minutes and then rapidly ascended into the sky and disappeared.
