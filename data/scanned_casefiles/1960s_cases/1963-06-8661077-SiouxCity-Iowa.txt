6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS ONE
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: A large star object observed
with a telescope. It had a blinking light and was moving in an irregular
zigzag path. Object then seemed to stop NE of the city.
17. CONCLUSIONS: The description of the stopping motion
and blinking light would indicate that this could have been an aircraft.
However, the flight path described is not normal for aircraft. Further
analysis of this object as I cannot make a definite conclusion.
