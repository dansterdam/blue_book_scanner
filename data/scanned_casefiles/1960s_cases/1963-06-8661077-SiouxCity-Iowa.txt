10. SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Circular object size of large star observed
in straight flight to the NE at uniform
speed. Object then seemed to stop NE of the
city.

11. COMMENTS
Duration of the stopping not reported
however the word seemed to stop was
used, therefore it is assumed that this
could have been an illusion. The satellite
ECHO I was over Sioux City at 0346E & over
the city at 62 deg elevation heading
NE. Flight, description of the object
and duration are consistant with the
analysis of this object as ECHO I.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
■ Other Satellite ECHO I
