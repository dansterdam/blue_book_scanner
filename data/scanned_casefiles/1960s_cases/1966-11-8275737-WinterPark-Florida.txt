COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICER

Mrs. indicated she sighted the object from her car when returning home at approximately 2345 hours. She did not stop at any time to make any further observations as she was tired and wanted to get to bed. Mrs. claimed this object was suspended at an approximate 450 angle, 2000 feet. in the distance and she viewed it steadily for about 2 minutes; she lost sight of it when her car passed underneath it. She made it clear on several occasions that she did not believe in flying saucers, but was curious as to what this sighting could be. She also asked if the Air Force had methods and instruments to investigate such objects. I had to repeat two or three times what I called her attention to this object and each time the answer was evasive; however, she finally said it was God's will that made her look into the sky. She also stated that God controlled the objects in the sky and not man.

Summary: I drove down the route she traveled; this route has large trees overhanging from both sides of the road and at one time or another the trees would have definitely obscured her vision. Further, it is improbable that she could have maintained control of her car without watching the road. I do not believe Mrs. was seeking any publicity but she did appear nervous throughout the questioning. It is my opinion that Mrs. had seen a reflection of some sort, and this should not be pursued any further.
