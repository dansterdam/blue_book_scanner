Observer noted a round-shaped orange colored object directly in front of her car. The object went down then up during the observation. Investigating officer drove down the same road as did the witness and found it impossible for a witness to have maintained control of her car without watching the road. It is believed the witness could have been looking at the reflection of some object in her windshield.

COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICER

Mrs. [redacted] indicated she sighted the object from her car when returning home at approximately 2:30 hours. She did not stop or take any further action as she was in a hurry. She claimed the object was suspended at an approximate 45 degree angle, 1000 to 2000 feet in the distance and remained stationary for some time. She made it clear on several occasions that she did not believe in flying saucers and was quite convinced as to what she had observed. To investigate such objects, she had to repeat two or three times what called her attention to this object and each time the answer was the same.

Summary: I drove down the route she traveled; this route has large trees overhanging from both sides of the road and at one time or another the trees would have definitely obscured her vision. It is interesting that she could identify the object and make such detailed observations. She appeared nervous throughout the questioning. It is my opinion that her sighting is either exaggerated or fictitious, and I would not recommend any further action or investigation.
