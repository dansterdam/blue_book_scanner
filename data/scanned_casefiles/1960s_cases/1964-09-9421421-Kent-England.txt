COPY.

2nd. October, 1964.

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your letter M of the 25th. September, 1964. There is little to add to the newspaper report which you enclosed with your letter, except to say that this object was seen at 4-5 a.m. on the 12th. September, 1964, and was observed by a number of police officers travelling in a northerly direction towards Bexley. It was quite bright in appearance and was lost from sight after a relatively few minutes.

Yours Faithfully,

Chief Constable of Kent.

REPORT TO THE U.S.A.F. BLUEBOOK PROJECT.

As you will see from the enclosed (a copy), an U.F.O. was observed on 12th Sept '64, by Kent police.

My own personal conclusion on this matter is that the police are very reliable reporters & therefore it can be taken for granted that this was not an optical illusion.

This is the first U.F.O. I have tried to get information on & to date have not been very successful, the reasons being stated below.

I'm going to place some as I can afford it, in the national papers, writing people who think they know something of a U.F.O. to write to me. I will be quite, but with care able to separate the good. Would you be interested in copies of these (if good).

I can't go on any more information just now in England. (2) Being a private official interest five to coin a phrase "leading by the head" against an "official brick wall" (3) Official would think that off the wall.

Any way if you allow this report, please would you let me know the result.

Munroe, Malcolm                                                Case 12 Sept 64

14th. September, 1964.

Dear Sir,

I am doing some private research work into "Unidentified Flying Objects" (U.F.O.). I have been in contact with the U.S. Air Attache here in London, and he recommended that I write to you as regards information on this subject. I would therefore be very grateful full if you would send me all the details on U.F.O.s that have been reported to the U.S.A.F.

Yours Faithfully,

[Signature redacted]
