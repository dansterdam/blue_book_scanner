Gentlemen,

Chance has put me in possession of what I believe to be a very fine, 35mm, color slide showing a presumably unidentified flying object.

The phenomenon is perfectly spherical, very luminescent, and obviously in horizontal movement. It is surrounded by a purple halo or aura ( probably compressed atmosphere ).

It quite accidentally showed up in a picture I took ( May 30 )of the Belgian Village at the New York World's Fair, and the object was not apparent to the naked eye at the time.

I understand from Newsday, a Long Island Daily, that you have a Dr. J. Allen Hynek investigating such phenomena.

If you think it may possibly be of interest to him and will inform me at what address he can be reached, I'll be glad to send the picture to him.

Very truly yours

Hempstead, N.Y.

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-103 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., requesting analysis of a color slide to determine the cause of a circular object visible in the sky. Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division (TDPA), and the Photo Processing Division (TDDPP).

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the color slide revealed no signature to the reported object in the sky. However, after close examination, the image in the slide appears to have been caused by a processing defect. The defect was possibly caused by a drop of bleach hitting the film prior to the first development.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a row of buildings or structures with some vehicles in the foreground, mounted on a white document page. There is a small dark object (possibly a UFO or artifact) in the sky above the buildings.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Some text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The document appears to be a UFO information request form with a date stamp of DEC 28 1965.
