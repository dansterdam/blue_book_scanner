GENTLEMEN:

On the night of February 11, 1964 I was walking home from a friend's house where I sighted what might have been a U.F.O. I was walking near a church which is a row of six story government buildings. At a minute or two before or after 11:15 P.M. I looked up and saw eight white objects traveling in a tight formation. Within a fraction of a second they passed XXKXXXXX from over the edge of the church where I first saw them, to behind the apartment buildings. I ran to the corner of the block in time to see the objects disappear behind the apartment buildings across the street. Throughout all of this time the objects moved in a straight line toward the Southeast.

After this I ran to my home (about a block away) and called the police. It is a representation of how I first sighted the objects. The objects themselves were oval shaped and white. They seemed very slightly fuzzy around the edges as though they might be glowing. I could see no surface features. They were about three-quarters the size of the full moon. I heard no sound as they passed over. They didn't seem to make any ending noise as they passed over. They didn't seem to make any ending noise as they passed away.

sound. The following morning, February 12, 1964, I called the Air Force in formation Service at PL-3-5509. I was told by the receptionist on duty that the matters were handled by your office and that I should write to you.
I would like to know if any other reports were received at the same time. What sort of explanation can you suggest for this sighting?
I will be glad to supply any further information if necessary.
Thank you.
Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]

The text in the document is as follows:

March 3, 1964

Dear Mr. ----,

This is in reply to your letter of February 12, 1964, in which you reported an unidentified flying object sighted in the New York area on the night of February 11th.

We appreciate your interest in reporting this sighting to us. However, due to the lateness of your observation because of the darkness of the evening, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory information necessary for evaluation. There are limitations to what can be determined from such late reports, and we would suggest that in the future you report sightings as soon as possible after they occur.

I am enclosing the basic fact sheet on the case. This will help to explain why further investigation cannot be conducted at this time.

Air Force personnel will be unable to contact you, as your letter did not include a phone number. However, if you have any additional information which you feel would be helpful to explain why this sighting may have been of interest, please feel free to write again.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS
MAJOR, USAF
