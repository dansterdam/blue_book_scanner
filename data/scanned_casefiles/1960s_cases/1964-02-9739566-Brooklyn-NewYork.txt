Gentlemen;

On the night of February 11, 1964 I was walking home from a friend's house when I sighted what might have been a U.F.O. I was walking near a church behind which is a row of six story apartment buildings. At a minute or two before or after 11:15 P.M. I looked up and saw eight white objects travelling in a tight formation. Within a fraction of a second they passed XXXXXXXX from over the edge of the church where I first saw them, to behind the apartment buildings.

I ran to the corner of the block, in the direction the objects were travelling, just in time to see the XXXX objects disappear behind the apartment buildings across the street.

Throughout all of this time the objects moved in a straight line toward the Southeast.

After this I ran to my home ( half a block away ) and drew the enclosed sketch. It is a representation of how the scene looked from where I first sighted the objects. The objects themselves were oval shaped and white. They seemed very slightly fuzzy around the edges as though they might be glowing. I could see no surface features. They were about three-fourths the diameter of the moon and almost as bright as the full moon. I heard no sound as they passed over. They didn't emit any engine noise or such.

sound. The following morning, February 12, 1964, I called the
Air Force Information Service at PL-7-5509. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
I was told by the sergeant on duty that such matters were
handled by your office and that I should write to you.

I would like to know if any other reports were reported at the same time. What sort of explanation can you suggest for this sighting?

I will be glad to supply any further information if necessary.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,

[Signature area is blacked out]

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch of buildings, including a church and an apartment building, with some oval shapes floating above them. The drawing seems to be dated Tuesday, February 11, 1964.

ATTN OF: TDEN

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (11 Feb 64)

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI-PD (Mrs Gaiser)
Wash 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted] requesting information on a UFO Sighting.

2. The information in [redacted] letter, regarding his sighting of 11 Feb 64, contains most of the essential information necessary for evaluation. However, no positive identification can be made on a sighting this brief. This is a possibility of light reflections of some sort and while the objects did not have tails and appeared to be in two lines rather than one, a meteor cannot be ruled out. No other reports were received from the New York area at this time.

Dear Mr [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of February 12, 1964, in which you reported an Unidentified Flying Object in the New York area on the night of February 11th.

The Air Force has been unable to make an evaluation of your observation because of the brevity and lack of essential information through your letter containing most of the information necessary for evaluation. There is possibly that light relations of some sort, and while the objects did not have tails and appeared to be in two lines rather than one, a meteor cannot be ruled out. No other reports were received from the New York area at this time.

We are enclosing the latest Fact Sheet on the Air Force program with respect to Unidentified Flying Objects. It is hoped that this Fact Sheet will be of interest to you and will help to explain why a sighting may remain "Unidentified" even though it contains all pertinent data necessary to suggest at least one valid hypothesis on its cause.

Sincerely,

MARSTON M. JACKS

DEAR SIRS:

SEVERAL WEEKS AGO I WROTE TO THIS DEPARTMENT ABOUT SOME UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS I HAD SEEN. I HAVE NOTHING FROM YOUR DEPT. YOU MAY CONSIDER MY SIGHTING PROD AND THE INFORMATION I SENT YOU TRIVIAL, BUT I DON'T. I ASKED A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN MY LETTER. I WOULD APPRECIATE A REPLY TO THEM.

WERE THERE ANY OTHER REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS THAT NIGHT (FEB. 11TH)? WHAT COULD YOU SUGGEST AS A CAUSE OF WHAT I SAW?

Sincerely,

[Signature and location details are redacted/blacked out]
