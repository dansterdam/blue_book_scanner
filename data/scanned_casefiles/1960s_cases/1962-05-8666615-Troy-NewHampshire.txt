Dear Sirs

May 27, 62 at the beginning of night I saw a big glow of light in the sky just over the hill. That night at 2:00 it was over a month a along Gap. My friend was the one whose it with his mother and two sisters. The next day in school my friend asked me"Doyou believe in flying saucers!"I said well there could be yes. Then he said it was over Gap and was moving up and down and side ways and then it slowly went out of sight and when it came back there were about 6 hours more and then went out of sight again.We did not see it again until May 29, 62. We saw it We were fishing and when we got to the top of the hill that is when we saw it. I called my parents to go out side to see it and they did and called our neighbor to come and see it.It did the same thing move around and disappear. This look like the Unidentified Flying Objects that some of the service men in the Army took pictures of. I saw the movie that the U.S. AIR FORCE had on them. My address is ----
