MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECT
ZOOMS OVER HAWAIIAN ISLES

HONOLULU, Mar. 12 — (UPI) — An unidentified flying object, traveling west at a very high altitude and a high rate of speed was sighted by hundreds of persons in the Hawaiian Islands last night.

Two Hawaii Air National Guard pilots said they saw the object north of the island of Kauai during a routine training mission in Jet Fighters at an altitude of 40,000 feet. Honolulu newspapers and radio stations were flooded with calls.

Capt. Jon Parish said he thought the object was possibly a rocket or some sort of space object flying a predetermined course. Lt. George Joy said he thought it was the Milky Way at first, but then noticed that it left a visible vapor trail.

HAWAII—March 11, 1963....The sighting of a fast-moving UFO which baffled jet-pilots, FAA control-tower operators, and thousands of residents, still has not been explained.

The pilots of National Guard jets were 21, flying at 40,000'. Capt Parish with was possibly a rocket or space object. Lt Joy reported seeing a vapor trail lighter than a jet's. "It was no aircraft" said the FAA spokesman, "and I know no one who knows what it was."

HAWAII—Mar 11, 1963....Hundreds of Hawaiians saw a U.O. flying at high altitude and high speed....two West Hawaii National Guard pilots on a training mission, spotted the object while flying at 40,000'. witnesses said the object appeared to be a bright crescent shape.

Crescent Over Hawaii

On the night of March 11, 1963, a crescent moon-shaped object passed over the area north of the Island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands. It was traveling toward the west, at a very high altitude and a high rate of speed. The UFO was very bright and some observers said it appeared to be on fire and appeared to fall into the sea.

Two Hawaii Air National Guard pilots, while flying at 40,000 feet, saw the object. Capt. Jon Parish said he felt the object was some type of rocket or space object flying a pre-determined course.

The second pilot, Lt. George Joy commented that the UFO left a visible vapor trail. Hundreds of other people saw the object and military officials would provide no explanation.
