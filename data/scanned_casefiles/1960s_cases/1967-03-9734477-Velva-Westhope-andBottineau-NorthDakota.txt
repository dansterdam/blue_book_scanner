11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Various observers watched a round shaped object in different parts of the sky. One observer noticed it red color when it traveled around the edges. The object traveled from the west to the east and was in sight for over one hour. In the western sky, one observer followed the object for approximately 17 minutes but could not catch the object. It definitely appears that two different objects were seen traveling across the sky at different times. The first object is believed to have been Venus while the other is undetermined.
