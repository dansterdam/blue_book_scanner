11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Various observers watched a round shaped object in different parts of the sky. One observer noticed a red glow, green around the edges, colored object travel from the east to the west. The object in this case was in sight for over one hour. The object did not disappear but was seen by another observer in the western sky. One observer followed the object for nearly 17 miles but could not catch the object. A truck driver watched a star like object in the NE part of the sky. It definitely appears that two different objects were responsible for the sightings. One was seen in the sky in three hours while the other was seen only in the northeastern sky. The first object is believed to have been Venus while the latter Arcturus.
