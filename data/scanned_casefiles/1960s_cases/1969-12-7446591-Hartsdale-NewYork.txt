Dear sir,

I have seen 2 UFO's in a 2 minuit period.One had lights one red,and
one white they were revolving around a round white light.This was at 9:45P.M.
it was going straight then stopped and hovered for one minut then it started
going again then it disappeared behind a tree and it never came out again.
While I was looking for it another UFO came out of nowhere it was only in
sight for about 10 seconds.It had a red,white,and another red flashing on
and off.It couldn't have been a plane because in was moving so fast.
I have already told you about another UFO so please send me Two forms
for the Two UFO's that I have seen.

Yours Truly

P.S. Please let me know what you find.
