WEIRD SIGHTING OF SIX-INCH-TALL CREATURES IN MINNESOTA: At about 7:30 P.M. on October 12, 1965, a man driving along a country road near his home in Lone Prairie, Minnesota, witnessed a close encounter with six-inch-tall humanoid creatures. The witness reported that the creatures emerged from the side of the road and appeared to be studying an automobile that was parked nearby. The creatures were described as being about six inches tall, and the witness stated that they did not have eyes, but appeared to be scanning the area. After a brief sighting, the creatures reportedly reentered the side of the road and disappeared. The case was investigated by Jim Townsend, a local radio announcer, who interviewed the witness and documented the incident.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:     12       Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points raised: 

Perhaps it would be better if I gave you a detailed account of the incident which I answered to this questionnaire. I was on Minnesota Highway 27 when I went around a curve and my attention was drawn to a bright light ahead of me. I looked up and saw this object setting in the middle of the road. It was around 7:15 PM because I had just checked my watch about 5 minutes before. My car almost stopped as I neared it, and I finally decided to stop about 20 ft. from it. My kind of math and being able to tell distances quite accurately, this object appeared an estimated 25-30 ft. in diameter. The front of it seemed transparent. The top of it had blinking lights. I can not be sure because I decided that nobody would believe me so I decided that I would not look it over and have some vivi evidence. I then got out of my car with the idea to go up to it and rock the center of gravity and sound it over to rock it, when the front of my car and stopped with no further lights going any further because these little "treasures" cam around behind loud and speed in front of the vehicle. I can not be sure because I do not see any eyes or any sort. I know that I was looking at what I have faintly watched. You must believe me!

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

"THEY WANTED TO SEE IF THEY COULD STOP MY CAR LIKE THEY DID THEY COULD ONLY DO TO SOME OF THE OTHERS. I FEEL THAT I WAS GETTING UP TO ABOUT 80 M.P.H. WHEN I SUDDENLY NOTICED MY CAR ENGINE STARTING TO SLOW DOWN AND MY CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN. I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY OF THE U.S. A GRAVE CRIME ACT TO LET THEM KNO WHAT HAPPENED ON THE 13 THAT THEY SEEMED TO DEMAND OF ME TO DO 7? IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE AGAIN 1I COULD HARDLY SAY THAT WE LIKE EACH OTHER FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES. THEY THEN TURNED AND THE OBJECT SEEMED TO HOVER THE OBJECT SEEMED TO HOVER SLOWLY. AFTER IT WAS ABOUT A MILE HIGH ( THIS IS ONLY MY IMAGINATION) THE LIGHT WENT OUT AND MY CAR ENGINE STARTED TO RUN DID NOT SEEM TO BOTHER ME. I LOOKED AT MY SPEEDOMETER AND IT HAD BEEN SETTING ON AND ON EVIDENTALLY THAT IT HAD BEEN ON THE GROUND I TOLD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND REPORTED IT. WE WENT BACK OUT TO THE SPOT AND THE SHERIFF. WE COULD NOT FIND ANY THINGS ON THE GROUND THAT WOULD SHOW THAT AN OBJECT HAD BEEN THERE. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. I KNOW WHAT I SAW BUT IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME WELL THATS TOUGH LUCK.

THANK YOU"
