WEIRD SIGHTING OF SIX-INCH-TALL CREATURES IN MINNESOTA: At about 7:15 on October 23rd, a 19-year-old radio announcer from Long Prairie, Minnesota, was driving along a country road near his home in a car when a large, six-shaped object straddling the road. It was 30 to 40 feet high and about 10 feet in diameter, and seemed to be resting on logs or trees.

The announcer, named James Townsend, stated: "My car engine, lights, and radio went out as I slammed on the brakes. I stopped about 20 feet in front of it. My first thought was to knock it over with the car so I could have some evidence, but then another thought was, 'Then I got out with the idea of trying to push it over by hand.' When I got to the front of my car, three creatures came out from behind the rocket. They looked like individual tin cans on tripods, and were about six inches tall. They didn't have eyes, but I knew they were looking at me. I stopped. I didn't have any desire to get closer. There was no sound."

"It seemed like ages that we looked at each other. Then they went up into the rocks, which had a bright colless light glowing out of the bottom. There was a loud hum. The craft went up and disappeared from view. As soon as the light on the bottom of the rocket went out, after the thing was in the air, my car radio and lights went on, and my engine started without my having to touch the starter."

Townsend was terrified, and drove back to Long Prairie at 90 miles an hour. He reported the sighting to the local sheriff, who came out to the spot with him but found no physical evidence of the landing, except for three strips of an oil-like substance on the road. Each strip was about a yard long and four inches apart. The sheriff told the press that Townsend is known to be a reliable and level-headed man, and he believes that he told the truth.

Three youths who had been hunting coons in the same area reported seeing a strange light in the sky at the same time Townsend said the object took off.

Perhaps it would be better if I gave you a detailed description of the U-F-Q that I saw and you would be better able to understand it than if I answered this questionnaire. I was driving west on Minn. highway 27 when I went around a bend in the road and my car engine stopped running and my headlights went off. I looked up and saw this object setting in the middle of the road. It was around 7:15 PM because I had just checked my watch about a minute before so I know what time it was. I finally coasted to a stop about 20 ft. from it. My knowledge of math and being able to tell distances quite accurately made this quite impossible to mistake. I sat and looked at it for what I would estimate a minute then I knew what it was and knew that nobody would believe me so I decided that I would have to knock it over and have some evidence. I tried to start my car but it would not start, I did not get my response on my starter. I then got out of my car with the idea to go up to it and try to rock the center of gravity and topple it over so I would have the evidence right there in black and white. I got to the front of my car and stopped with no further interest in going any further because three little "creatures" came from around behind and stood in front of the object. I think that they were looking at me, I can not be sure because I did not see any eyes of any sort. I know that I was looking at them and I was quite fascinated at what I saw. You might ask me why, if...

I was willing to go up to them before. I did not go my way now. I used what I hope was common sense. I felt if they could stop my car like they did they could surely do something worse to me and I wanted to live to tell this story so the people of the United States would know that there were things of this nature. I will tell you right now that I think you are doing the people of the US a grave crime not to let them know that there are things of this nature. We stood and looked at them for what seemed to me to be ages. I can safely say that we "looked" at each other for about 3 minutes. They then turned and went under the object and a few seconds later the object started to rise slowly. After it was about 1/2 mile high (this is only a guess) the light went out and my car engine started to run again (I did not have to touch the starter) and my headlights came on.

I looked the area that it had been setting on and could see no evidence that it had been on the ground. I then drove to the Todd County Sheriff's office and reported what I had seen so the sheriff. We went back out to the spot and the sheriff could not find any thing on the road that would show that they were on the ground. That is what happened. I know that it is quite a wild story but if you do not believe me, well that's your tough luck.

Thank you
