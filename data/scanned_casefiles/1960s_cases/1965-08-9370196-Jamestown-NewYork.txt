11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object appeared as a silverblue light brighter than 1st mag. Located just above the horizon in West. Dusk. Clouds in the background. Object moved slowly to South and disappeared over the horizon. While on phone reporting this object as brilliant blue light was observed behind a barn about 1,000 ft away. This lasted for 4-5 minutes. This caused heavy static and distorted TV picture. Observer stated that he saw same thing two days earlier only didn't tell anyone.

Case followed newspaper sighting 19 Aug. Youth 15 yr old, doesn't appear logical that he would report one object as he was doing by calling the Air Force and yet NOT report a more unusual sighting. 1st object setting in West. VENUS. This planet was on the horizon at 270 deg azimuth in the process of setting. 2nd object uncovered. SUCAR. FILL.
