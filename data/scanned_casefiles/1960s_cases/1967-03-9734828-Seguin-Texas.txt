HYPOTHESIS: THE LARGE NUMBER, REFLECTIVE QUALITY, AND MOVEMENT OF
OBJECTS SUGGESTS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, METALLIC CONSTRUCTION WHICH
WOULD TEND TO BE TRANSPORTED BY THE WIND CURRENTS. OBSERVERS

HAVE BEEN DUE TO SUN REFLECTING ON OBJECTS AS SUN PENETRATED THIN

HAVE HAD TO BE AT OR GREATER THAN AN ALTITUDE OF 20,000 FT. EITHER
OF ABOVE STATED CONDITIONS MAY BE EXPLAINED AS CHAFFREFLECTING
IN SUN. CHAFF IS OFTEN DROPPED BY AF ACFT IN THIS AREA. LOCAL
RADAR CONTROLLERS STATE THAT CHAFF IS DISCERNIBLE ON THEIR RADAR
SCOPES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME (40 MINS TO HOUR) WHEN UPPER
WINDS ARE LIGHT IN INTENSITY. A CHAFF DROP WAS MADE OVER JUNCTION,
TEX APPROX 100 MILES WEST NORTH WEST AT 24,000 FT.
THIS DROP MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE ALTHOUGH UPPER AIR WINDS
REPORTED AT THAT TIME DO NOT SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION.
