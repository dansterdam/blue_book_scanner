1. Attached is a letter forwarded to this office from Mr. Thomas E. Healy, 12 Commonwealth Road, Lynn, Mass., reporting a UFO. The letter is self-explanatory.

2. On 14 August 1964, the Information Office received a call from a Mrs. [redacted] of Franklin, Mass., telephone number [redacted]. Mrs. [redacted] claims that since July 29th she has been spotting objects resembling lights the size of trailer truck tires dancing on the treetops from dusk until daylight. This light is red, turning blue and then white. One light, she claims, was green and the shape of a becoming. They appear on Thursday and Friday evenings in a wooded area around her house. Apparently when a plane flies overhead, the lights disappear.

3. A local television program presented a program on the UFO's on the evening of 13 August. Whether this had any effect on the caller is hard to tell because she claimed that she has been spotting these objects for the past three months.
