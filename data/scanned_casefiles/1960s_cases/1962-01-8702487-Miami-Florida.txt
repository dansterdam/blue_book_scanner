UFO Sighting

Miami, Florida

Dear Mr.

Your recent letter of 25 January 1963 to Dr. Hynek has been referred to TD (TD-8), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

The negative in question was forwarded to us by the 19th Bombardment Wing with indication that it was to be returned to you; and it was, therefore, retained in our files. Now, upon your request, we are returning the negative and are including with it a print and enlargement.

Photo analysis indicates that aircraft is the most probable cause of the sighting.

We appreciate your interest in the U.F.O. program and thank you for your cooperation with the Air Force on this matter.

Sincerely,

ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science and Components

Dear Sir:

On January 25, 1962, four members of the Miami Astronomical Association and I held an observing session at my home at 9:25 P.M. we all saw four charge objects traveling in a straight line from SSE to NNW. I secured a poor quality photograph of 4 objects.

Our entire report, including the negative, was submitted to the USAF Meteorological Station, Florida. A Mr. Holdaway (10702nd. Kolo/7720) of the 19th ACOIBT WG (C)(S)1 of the USAF took our reports and promised to try photographing would be returned. This was almost a year ago. It was later learned from Mr. James Dueves (one of our members who saw the objects), that information was all relayed to you at Northwestern University.

I have been waiting patiently for a year now, and I will deeply appreciate the return of my photograph.

Thank you for your trouble.

Yours very truly,

Summary On 25 January 1962, at approximately 2125 local time, a group of five observers
allegedly witnessed what appeared to be a formation of four UFO's flying across the Miami
area. An immediate investigation was initiated. After comprehensively investigating, no definite conclusions as to the nature of the objects could be reached. There was no other confirmation of these sightings by other sources. The only physical
evidence submitted was a ten minute time exposure, taken inadvertently due to a coincidental photographic error. While they seemed to be well informed about astronomy, their reliability from an Intelligence standpoint is considered doubtful due to their youth and inexperience regarding these matters.

On 25 January 1962, four alleged UFO's were sighted by the following members of a
group known as the Miami Astronomical Association. The standard Intelligence Evaluation

2. In accordance with AFR 200-2, Section C, Paragraph 15, the following data is submitted:
a. Description of the Objects:
   (1) The objects were observed by the five witnesses named in Para 1 as follows:
       (a)    saw a hazy line which later appeared to disperse into four oval
       shaped objects after three to four seconds of observation.
       (b)    using binoculars, appears to have witnessed four round objects
       shaped like small round discs that were a bit "indistinct, somewhat blurred
       and fuzzy."
   (c)    observed a hazy line and noticed four "dots" that appeared
       slightly fuzzy after three to four seconds of observation.
   (d)    could not distinguish any discs with his naked eye. He observed
       what appeared to be a diffused, cluster-like object.
   (e)    Four observed a hazy, cluster-like, fuzzy, vaguely circular
       in shape with no definite or distinct borders.

   (2) All witnesses agree that the objects were extremely small and could be compared to a period (.) at the end of a sentence, relatively speaking.

   (3) The color of the objects was observed by the witnesses as follows:
       (a)    believed that at first the objects looked dull white but as they
       came overhead they appeared to be a whitish-orange.
       (b)    appeared to cohere was coherent that the objects were reddish-orange in color.
       (c)    could observe no particular color until the objects were
       overhead when they then appeared to be reddish-orange in color.
       (d)    deviation from the color of the objects as greyish, or blue-green.
       This deviation from the color the others described could be possibly due to
       color-blindness which would cause him to see the objects colored as he described them.
       (e)    appeared to be blurred of the color of the objects around the edges which
       appeared to be blurred of a hazy was grey or blue-green but the center was
       brighter in that it appeared to be yellow-orange.

   (4) The total number of objects observed was four (4) in number.

   (5) The formation of the objects was described by the witnesses as follows:
       (a)    Observed a hazy line which passed overhead and appeared
       to separate into four objects which appeared to take divergent courses upon
       approaching the horizon.    Two of the objects went in an Easterly direction,
       one of the objects traveled in a Northwesterly direction, and one went in a
       Westerly direction.    The formation for the majority of the observation period
       appeared to be cluster-like.
       (b)    First observed the four objects in a straight line formation
       which was then changed to resemble a flat-diamond shape which was maintained
       until they disappeared.
       (c)    observed the objects in a straight line and as they appeared
       overhead, four objects were distinguishable.    They appeared to him to be
       somewhat in a straight line.    (Note: Silverman wears glasses.    His eyes are
       not strong and he is the only one of the five that does wear glasses.    He
       freely admits that he might be wrong in his observation but that is what he
       believes he saw.)
       (d)    observed the objects in a straight line, "like the trail of a
       meteor."    He was able to distinguish four objects as they passed overhead.
       Almost at the horizon one of the objects went East.
       (e)    did not notice the straight line formation observed by the
       others.    He first saw objects overhead and thought it was the Good-Year Blimp
       but on a second look was able to distinguish four objects which assumed some
       kind of a formation but he cannot be sure as to exactly what it was.

   (6) There were no discernible features or details distinguishable.
   (7) No tail, trail, or exhaust was observed.
   (8) No sound was heard, but at the time of the visual observation, Police or
       Fire alarms were sounding which made any audible observation practically nil.
   (9) There were no other pertinent or unusual features observed other than the
       already described thus far.

b. Description of the course of the objects is as follows:
   (1) The first witness saw the phenomenon.    His astro-
       nomical observatory was "star-gazing" and he first though he saw a meteor but upon
       further observation drew the conclusion previously stated.
   (2) The objects were first observed about 40° (degrees) above the Southern Horizon
       at an undetermined altitude of anywhere between ten and twenty-five thousand feet.
   (3) The angle of the objects upon disappearance was about 20° to 35° above the
       Northern horizon.

(4) The objects appeared from the SSE in a straight line. As they came overhead, four objects were discernible and continued to be so as they disappeared into the NNW appearing to form a cluster-like, or diamond shaped formation.

(5) All four objects gradually disappeared into the NNW in what might be termed a "Horizon Clare" due to the city lights of Miami.

(6) The total observation time involved was approximately twenty (20) seconds.

c. The manner of observation used was ground-visual and one of the members utilized "Traced" Binoculars of 20 x 50 power.

d. The time and date of sighting was as follows:
(1) 0225d/26 January 1962
(2) At the time of the observation it was night.
e. All the observers were located in a Parking Lot between 6th and 7th Avenue on 10th
f. Street in South West Miami, Florida at coordinates 25-46-00N, 080-12-00W.
g. For identifying information on the observers refer to Para 1, Sec a through e.

(1) Observers account of weather conditions and Place of Sighting:
h. Meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting. A check with the Miami International Airport weather station showed as the observer for this area revealed a negative report on any unusual activity in the area between 0200/0300z 26 Jan 62. The same results can be recorded with respect to a conversation held with SSgt Turney of the 644th Radar Squadron (SAGE) at their Operations Area Richmond at Homestead AFB.

i. In relation to Interception-Of-Identification action taken regarding the suspected UFO's, a query to Tyndall AFB revealed that no report was received by them and a query to the 432nd Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Detachment #1, stationed here at Homestead AFB, revealed that no report was received by them.

j. All possible sources were checked for any objects that may have been in the area of observation during the stated time 0200-0300z/26 Jan 62. No aircraft from Homestead AFB was in the Miami area at that time. A query to Tyndall AFB on 5 Feb 62 was answered by the AO, Capt(name blacked out) which was no aircraft from Tyndall in the Miami Area during that period of time.

k. One photograph was obtained of what is believed by the observers to be the track of the UFO's. The camera used to photograph the objects was of a home-made variety. It is known as an "Astrogaph" and was produced by one of the observers, Michael Harrison. The Astrograph has a 4" lens mounted in a 7" x 7" plywood box with a 30 x 40 cm guide telescope mounted on the side with the Astrograph off-center on the mounting to allow for the guide telescope's weight. It uses 2½" x 3½" sheet film. A German equatorial mounting is used to support the Astrograph and the guide tele-scope. A gear assembly with a ratio of 1 to 19.5 is attached to a hole bored in the polar axis. This serves as a hand operated slow-motion drive. The camera lens was obtained from a hand magnifier and is 4" in diameter with a focal ratio of f/2. It is a simple non-achromatic double convex lens. The total time of the exposure was ten minutes with the film used being Kodak Super Panchromatic Press 250 ASA Type B rating. The camera was pointed vertically in a NE Direction at an almost perfect 90° angle from the ground. The attached prints were made at the 19th Bomb Wg Photo Lab and are submitted IAW AFR 200-2 and AFR 200-15. An analysis of the print was made by the NCOIC of the Photo Lab, TSgt Evans. The negative encloses should be returned to the address given in this report after all necessary uses have been made.

1. This report was prepared by A2C Joseph F. Kolodney, AF 11371051, 19th Intelligence Division (1960D), Headquarters 19th Bombardment Wing (H), USAF, Homestead AFB, Florida. In the course of this investigation Airman Kolodney made a personal interrogation of the witnesses to the alleged UFO observation. All five witnesses agree on the fact that the objects appeared first as a hazy line and after three or four seconds appeared to assume a four object configuration of some nature. The majority of these witnesses appear to agree that the color of the subjects (objects) was the orange to a varying degree.

All five observers have a strong interest in astronomy and appear to be more informed then the average layman. However, there is no reason to doubt their veracity in the reporting of these objects. However, the only thing that can be said as to their reliability is that they are not qualified to deduce from their observations exactly what the objects may have been. Therefore this reliability as observers is subject to question. Although all efforts to establish the presence of these objects in the Miami area during that period of report has led to nothing, if is considered that what they saw was a passing of meteoric fragments moving at an exceedingly fast rate or Echo I which might have caused an optical illusion and was reported in the Miami area during that period at approximately two hour intervals.

Dear Sirs:

My name [redacted] and I reside at [redacted] Street, Coral Gables 46, Florida. I am an amateur astronomer, a member of the Miami Astronomical Association and the Southern Cross Astronomical Association of Miami, Florida.

On the night of January 25, 1962, a private star party was held at the residence of [redacted] Street, Miami, Florida for some of the members of the Miami Astronomical Association. Ascending the session were [redacted] and myself.

At approximately 9:25 P.M. E.S.T., all the members noticed four diffuse like objects, which were traveling almost overhead in a northerly direction. They evidently commenced from the south. These objects were approximately of a second magnitude. I then observed them through my binoculars. The objects were reddish yellow to reddish orange in colour. I also noticed that the objects were shaped like a disk, no larger than the disk of Saturn as seen through a six inch reflector telescope. The objects were traveling first in a straight line, then changed to a formation shaped like a flat diamond. I first notice the objects in the constellation of Gemini and saw them until they disappeared in the north. The speed of the objects was certainly faster than that of an ordinary jet fighter. The entire phenomena lasted for twenty seconds.

Photographs one of the objects and will be sent to you in a week to ten days.

We arrived at the conclusion that these objects were not optical illusions nor a hoax. We also eliminated the possibility of their being airplanes, weather balloons, meteors, celestial objects, missiles or of any man made craft at this time.

We therefore, do not wish to arrive at any conclusions at what these objects were, for the time being. We would like to see our reports handed to the proper authorities and analyzed by them. We would like to know, if there have been any other reports by people in the Miami area or the South Florida area who saw these same objects.

Thank you very much for taking the courtesy to read this letter.

Very truly yours,

1. The following is a Photographic analysis of print 1/L-V/U marked in orange, submitted to the 19th Intelligence Division regarding the UFO sighting 26/02252 January 1962. The estimate of the print was made by TSGT Eugene M. Lasalle, NCOIC of the 19th Bomb Wing Photo Lab, Homestead AFB, Florida. Each alphabetical letter is keyed to the matching it on the print.

A. Dust on raw film when exposure was made (leaves black mark on print).

B. Dust on negative when print was made (leaves white marks on print).

C. Scratch on negative (as this doesn't show on print, the negative was probably scratched after the print was made).

D. Unknown foreign matter stuck to the back of film (this is not a photographic image) while the negative was drying.
The foreign matter might possibly be Cotton lint as negatives are commonly wiped with cotton swabs when hung up to dry. The lint is now missing but its imprint remains in the anti-curl backing of the film.

E. UNKNOWN - Probably star tracks as both are exactly the same length as they would be during a time exposure of the night sky. The reason for only two of them showing is the narrow field of vision caused when using a four inch lens on a 2½ x 3½ negative size camera.

F. UNKNOWN - The following are possible:

1. Aircraft: The changing position of the four UFO objects could be caused by the changing angle of aircraft and viewer as it passed over. (note: Aircraft with bright lights are known to be operating in the area on a Ground to Air Triangulation Survey Project being conducted by the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey and the Radio Corporation of America (RCA)).

2. Rocket: Rockets as well as aircraft are being used for the same survey project.

3. Man-made Satellite: Either passing over, going up from the launch site or coming down through a canosphere friction.

4. Meteorites will fall and break up the same as satellites only usually at a faster speed.

5. Still UFO.
