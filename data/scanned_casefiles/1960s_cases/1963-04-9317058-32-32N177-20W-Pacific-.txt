Here is the text from the document:

[The document appears to be a data table with multiple columns of numerical data, with dates across the top rows. The header at the top of the page is partially illegible. The table seems to be related to satellite tracking or positioning data, with columns for dates, times, and various numerical coordinates. Due to the density and small font size of the text, a complete verbatim transcription would be extremely lengthy. The document appears to be from April 1963 based on the visible date headers.]

The text is primarily numerical data in a grid format, with dates like "April 3, 1963", "April 4, 1963", etc. across the top of the document. The columns contain what appear to be longitude, latitude, and other numerical tracking or positioning data.
