Subj:    Sighting of 17 June 1967, Phoenix, Arizona, 
          enclosed with your letter of 19 February 1968

To:      Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

1. I find that there is not enough information to attempt a firm 
evaluation. Information on the "light curve" would be specifically 
needed. This might be obtained through interrogation of the witnesses, 
but since the witness is a 12-year old boy with subjective impressions 
of the event may color the objective facts to such an extent that we 
still will not get firm data.

2. If you authorize it, I will be happy to make a phone call to 
Mr. Perry and attempt a further evaluation of the facts.

3. From the limited data at hand, a meteor explanation seems to be 
the most likely event though five seconds is too long a time to cover 
the limited arc indicated. His time estimate may be in error as well 
as the arc covered. He speaks of "great speed" and this too is in 
contradiction with the relatively short arc covered in five seconds.

4. I would recommend that the phone call be made.

UFO Observation, 17 June 1967

Dr. Charles P. Olivier

1. Reference the student flight report form which you submitted to this headquarters relative to a UFO observation. This headquarters is interested in obtaining additional information concerning your observation. This will help us to better evaluate the report and determine the nature of the sighting.

2. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In reply to your letter of Feb.19 which concerns an observation by Stephen N.Perry of Phoenix,Arl., of a body he saw on 1968 June 17, Our files have been examined and no fireball was reported on that night to us.

However, as explained to you before, this means a little as undoubtedly we receive reports of only a small percent of those seen over U.S.A.

The report he sent seems that of a bright meteor or similar event, phoenix, and other data all fit in well. As for the flickering, it is not too uncommon for such bodies to change brilliancy during flight. Also very thin clouds behind which it might have passed could cause it. In any case, it would not take the body he saw from the meteor category.

As you suggested, his report is being placed in fireball file here.

Your cooperation in sending us reports is very much appreciated, and helpful.

Sincerely yours,
Charles M. Olivier

UFO Observation, 17 June 1967

1. This replies to your letter concerning your observation of an uniden-
tified flying object.

2. While reviewing our correspondence files we found your letter in
which you reported seeing an unidentified object on 17 June 1967. Be-
cause of an error, your sighting was not investigated at that time. We
have over 10,000 letters and investigate approximately 1,000 UFO sight-
ings a year, once in a while an error is made. We regret that this has
kept us from investigating your observation. However, if you would con-
sider the enclosed AF Form 117 we will investigate your sighting in an
attempt to determine the stimulus for your observation.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force, once again.
Please excuse us for not responding to your correspondence earlier.

Dear [redacted]:

This replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Gentlemen:

On the 17th day of June, 1967, at around 10:00 P.M., I had seen what appeared to be a meteor re-entering into the atmosphere. I have seen many meteors before, but never like this "thing". I saw it enter from the sky, and come down at a great speed for five seconds before it disappeared.

The strange thing about it was that it's white light blinked on and off three times before it disappeared. There was no sign of it after it was gone.

Yours truly,

[Redacted name]
Age 12½

P.S. Please look into this thoroughly.

Phoenix, Arizona

Dear Gentlemen,

Previously (5-18-67) I had written to you about a U.F.O. I had sighted. When you wrote to me and had stated that I had "insufficient data." I shall now give you all the information I came on June the 17th, 1967 at about 10:00 PM. I had seen what appeared to be a meteor. The sky was completely clear with moderate temperature. I was staring alone me, right sky at the stars straight alone my house at an extremely high altitude. (my town Phoenix, Arizona) Its light was white straight down with an angle estimate at its high velocity) but I could not 1,000 miles per hour. It appeared for five seconds, on and off 3 times. A trail was not left. I did not see an affliction nor hear one.


- page 18 -

For that matter, I didn't hear any sounds at all. I here were no other witnesses at the time. At past I was convinced it was a meteor, but I've never seen one behave like it did. (blinking of course) I have seen many meteors but not like that "thing"!

Please investigate this matter thoroughly,

Thank You.

Yours Truly,
Age 12½

P.S. Please let me know your findings.

(4) LIGHT MOVED RAPIDLY FROM THE NORTHEAST TOWARD OBSERVERS, VEERED OFF TOWARD THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST, DECREASED ALTITUDE, AND, BEFORE DISAPPEARING, APPEARED TO REMAIN PART OF ITS INITIAL ALTITUDE. MOVEMENTS WERE SUBSTANTIAL. THE OBSERVER SAID IT SEEMED LIKE AN ARCHING SKYWARD.

(5) OBJECT SEEMED TO RECEDE QUICKLY AND DISAPPEAR ALMOST INSTANTLY BUT DID NOT DROP BELOW THE HORIZON.

FIRST MAKING SIGHT OF IT, HE SEEMED TO ASSIST THE WITNESSES OF A
FIRST MAGNITUDE STAR. IN [BLACKED OUT] ORIGINAL LETTER HE SET THE DATE
OF THE SIGHTING AS "POSSIBLY ON JUNE 7". IN AN INTERVIEW HE MODIFIED
THIS TO EITHER JUNE 7 OR A BIT LATER, BY RELATING THE DATE OF SIGHTING

AMONG 15 MORE: (1) THAT IT WAS FIXED AT AIRCRAFT LIGHT OF SOME KIND, AND
(2) THAT IT WAS A BIT AT DELTA, NOSE OF A POLYETHYLENE BALLOON.

AND, COULD A MORE BUILDING, NOSE OF BALLOON, WERE OTHER THE
SOURCE OF SEVERAL UFO REPORTS IN RECENT YEARS. THE SIGHTING
POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, FAILS TO EXPLAIN. LACK OF SOUND, ITS SPEED,
THE APPEARANCE OF ONLY ONE LIGHT, AND ITS ERRATIC MOVEMENT.

UFO Observation, 17 June 1967

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

1. Reference your letter of 28 February 1968 with regards to the observation of 17 June 1967, Phoenix, Arizona. In your letter you stated that you feel this information is insufficient for an evaluation and have requested permission to telephone the observer. You may certainly do so if you feel that it is necessary.

2. As you know, we send copies of sightings that appear to have been caused by meteors to Dr. Olivier of the American Meteor Society for their records. In a letter of 28 February 1968, Dr. Olivier stated that he felt the observation was probably that of a meteor. Attached is a copy of his letter that I feel will be of interest to you.
