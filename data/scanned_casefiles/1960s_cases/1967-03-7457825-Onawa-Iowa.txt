Object first sighted by my 17 yr old son. Had Curtis from the "signal-station" window. When first seen, from home's west window. Object was above, traveling in the west, slightly north, passing over houses at terrific speed. Time was somewhere between 9:05 pm and 9:20 p.m. Object moved in straight path, did not waver. Made no noise. After it had passed overhead, but before it had disappeared, we could see a jet, but could also see it, above and to the left of the jet. Object passed fairly low enough that if object had been a plane, there should have been a great deal of noise. Lighted area was not like a spotlight. Lighted area was quite large, curved. Lighted area was of a fairly large area. Plain area shadowed and indistinct, but definitely some density. These lighted areas were definitely intense. Lit. almost like white type. Total time of sighting 45-60 seconds estimated. I honestly don't know what I saw. I only know that I have never seen anything like the sky shaped quite like it. Now have I seen any plane "which moved at such great speed."

This object was moving faster than any aircraft I have ever seen before. I was most impressed by the lighted area. It seemed to come from a convex window or windows and was intensely bright. Light did not actually shine as a beam, but gave the feeling of coming from a window. At one point, when the object was straight overhead, it was distinctly outlines, except for the rear 1/3 of area, which could or could not have been concave. Before the object disappeared, could near and see jet plane, higher and to the left of the object. At no time did I see any familiar type of aircraft lighting.
