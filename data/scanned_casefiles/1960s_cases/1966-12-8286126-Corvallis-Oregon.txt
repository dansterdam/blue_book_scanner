29 Dec. 66

Contact was made with the 93rd BW, Castle AFB, Calif. regarding aircraft participating in the refueling track Ocean Tide (Bravo), AR-88. Two KC-135's were on the track between 0235 and 0325. These aircraft would have been traveling toward the north and after passing the Eugene Vortac would have made a left 10 degrees angle bank turn so that the aircraft would have been in position to fly south on another refueling track. These aircraft would have been passing near the town of Corvallis, at or about the time of the sightings. The town of Corvallis, Oregon is at 44 34N 123 17W. The Eugene Vortac is at 44 07N/123 15W.

Contact was made with Maj. Shirflit, Adair AFS, Oregon. Major Shirflit contacted the West Coast Airlines but they did not have any aircraft in the area. He did not contact the FAA. The weather bureau reported a ceiling of 6000 feet and overcast, but there was no indication of how thick the cloud cover was at the time of the sightings. Major Shirflit will check with the FAA and call back with additional information.

Major Shirflit called back to say that he had checked with the FAA. There was only one aircraft on record; this being an aircraft inbound from the south that landed at Eugene, Oregon. Major Shirflit said that there are numerous small aircraft that fly in the area without IFR instructions. After being told of the KC-135's in the area he said the didn't believe that these aircraft were seen because of the cloud cover. He said that if appears that a small aircraft was observed which was flying on a VFR flight plan.

It should be noted that two of the observers said that the clouds were either broken or thinly overcast. If the clouds were broken at all during the observation the two KC-135 aircraft could have been seen.
