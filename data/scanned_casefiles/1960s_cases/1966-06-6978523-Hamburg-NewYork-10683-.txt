INVESTIGATOR: CAPTAIN JAMES BARKER

1. SUMMARY

Received report from Mr. WILLIAM THOMPSON, age 45, of 10683 Main Street, Hamburg, New York, regarding an unidentified flying object sighted in the sky above his residence on the evening of 6 June 1966 at approximately 2100 hours.

2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING 

Mr. THOMPSON reported observing an unusual object in the sky for several minutes on the evening of 6 June 1966. He states the object appeared to be a bright, glowing light that hovered silently and then moved rapidly straight up and disappeared from sight. Mr. THOMPSON further stated the object did not resemble any conventional aircraft he had previously observed.

3. INVESTIGATION

Interviewed Mr. THOMPSON at his residence and obtained a written statement of his observations. Inspected the area of the sighting and found no physical evidence to corroborate the reported incident. No other witnesses could be located in the immediate vicinity. Weather conditions at the time were clear with no cloud cover.

4. CONCLUSION

Based on the information gathered, this incident does not appear to be conclusive evidence of an unidentified flying object. The sighting by Mr. THOMPSON is considered to be an isolated incident lacking substantive proof. No further action is recommended at this time.
