Here is the text I can extract from the document:

[Most of the text is partially legible, with some words and sections being difficult to read clearly. I will transcribe what I can make out:]

[Top of page appears to have some header text, but it is too blurry to confidently transcribe]

[First paragraph begins with:]
"Capt. Hardin..."

[The rest of the text contains fragments and partially visible words, but a complete and accurate transcription is challenging due to the image quality. Some words and phrases are discernible, but not enough to construct full sentences with confidence.]

The bottom of the page appears to have some names or signatures, but they are also not clearly legible.

Would you like me to attempt a more detailed transcription, noting which parts are illegible?

N.S. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
