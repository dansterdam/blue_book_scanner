TIME: Between 10:00 to 11:00 PM

REPORT OF UFO

1. COLOR: Flashing red and white with some blue.
2. Had left a trailer parked behind it.
3. Was observed of like a disc. 
4. Tested first sighted in the N.W., then in the WEST.
5. Was circular and when observed longer south like.
It was hovering over something or waiting for something to materialize. It was fairly large and round like a grain mill and hovered for several minutes. The witness could not determine just what it was, but from past experience of many years standing and knowing what the different objects is in the sky, he stated this was not any aircraft or satellite. He judged the size to be about 60 to 80 feet in diameter and as there was a trailer parked near it, the UFO appeared to be over twice as large as the trailer.

Dear Sir,

About 9:45 PM on June 9, 1967 I got a call from my son-in-law, who asked me to go and look in the sky as he thought he saw a UFO. I asked him several questions about what he had seen and he said it was a bright silvery object and was moving erratically high in the sky.  Since I was very interested in the subject of UFOs and had seen one myself many years ago, I went outside immediately and started scanning the sky.

At about 10:00 PM I saw a bright, silvery object come into view from the southeast, moving slowly, and with a gentle rocking motion. It was approximately 1/3 the size of the full moon and was very bright, almost like a searchlight. I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it went behind some trees and I lost sight of it.

A few minutes later, the object reappeared, this time from the west, and again it was moving slowly with a rocking motion. I watched it for another 5 minutes or so and then it seemed to just fade away, or perhaps went behind more trees, I'm not sure.

I called the U.F.O. center and told them what I had seen. They were very interested and said they would send an investigator out. I am hoping you can shed some light on what the people in the sky might have been.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather diagrams and sketches. The first diagram shows a curved line representing the horizon, with angles and elevations drawn to indicate the angle of an object above the horizon. The second diagram is a compass rose, showing the cardinal directions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Only 1 object. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
