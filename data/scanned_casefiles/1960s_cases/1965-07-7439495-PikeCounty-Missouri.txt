Mrs. Rent/man/SAFCIRC/72842/29 Sep 65
SEP 29 1965

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your report of aerial objects which you observed on the night of 25 July 1965.

Your report is similar to the many reports in our files of unidentified aerial phenomena. These objects, which have been called UFOs, are often descriptions of natural phenomena, such as aircraft reflecting the sun, the planet Venus, meteors, and the like. In a small percentage of cases, the objects remain unidentified after investigation. This is not surprising since it is difficult to identify an object satisfactorily when the observation is of brief duration or under poor visibility conditions.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division

UFO Sighting, Pike County, Missouri 

TO: HQ USAF SAFOTC (Mrs Hunt)
WASH D C 20330

1. Forwarded is the attached unidentified object report from 25 July and 1 Aug 65 sightings of objects over Pike County, Missouri, as a follow-up to our files of helicopter observations. The slow flight, including operations of hovering, the vertical ascent and the apparent erratic fluctuation of the red light is characteristic of these reports.

The similarities to the flashing of the lights to a strobe light effect, when the light shines through the "bubble" or open portion of the craft, is quite likely what was observed. This, coupled with the observation that the object is located on aviation station charts, is used as a reference point in cross-country flights.

2. We had no unusual reports from Pike County, Missouri during this period. The ANG reported no unidentified tracks from their radar.

Helicopters on flights of this nature could be flown by the Air National Guard, USAF, Army and/or other military units within a radius of 150 miles. In view of the reported characteristics, this incident does not appear to be an Unconventional Aerial Phenomenon.

"Incident to two U.F.O. Sightings
What? - States a strange man-made object
Size - 20-25 ft long 
Course - NorthEast to B.C. 

Dear Sir -
Our sighting is located in Pike County, Missouri. It was about 10:30 PM on Sunday night. Our family was out in the yard walking under a light sky - it was a relatively light night. We all noticed a light in the sky, which at first we thought was an airplane. As it came closer, however, we could see it was a strange man-made object - not an airplane at all. It was larger than any commercial aircraft and had no lights or wings. It was shaped like a long cylinder and had a reddish-orange glow that seemed to come from the entire body, rather than from any specific source. The object moved silently across the sky in a northeast direction, crossed over our house, and then continued on toward the northeast. It disappeared from sight after 3-4 minutes. 
We were all amazed and puzzled by this sight. None of us had ever seen anything like it before. I am a college professor and my wife is a high school teacher, so we are reasonably educated and objective people. We feel sure that what we saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known aircraft. It was definitely a strange man-made object that we cannot identify.
I would appreciate any comments or information you could provide about similar sightings in this area. We will be watching the skies more closely from now on.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]"

Started seeing to the south east in the sky of about 60 degrees - a light appeared to travel at a rapid rate and at times hovering and disappearing from sight. As it approached it seemed to be disc shaped about 15-20 feet in diameter and had a reddish orange color the disc tilted on its edge and seemed to have a white light around its edge as it tilted on edge it changed to orange color again. After tilting on edge it seemed to shoot from that position approximately 20 seconds after first observed it at the above location it also shot off rapidly out of sight and disappeared - seemed to be about 200 yards from observer at that point - with no sound and no trail was observed. Over cast sky with little wind, observer a reliable witness. No further details could be obtained on this sighting due to lack of additional information.

There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which I will transcribe as follows:

Quartermaster was urgently told to be in Sikeston Mo, Made an effort to reeve them in a hurry-Due to the fact that Sikeston Tenn. were receiving hundreds of reports of strange light and maneuvers by a craft this was a rare occurrence of actually capturing a UFO. A Air Force team from Scott Airforce Base was ordered to investigate this sighting immediately. This constant pattern of an unusual light-sighting of 10-12 yr olds. That was not a hoax-nor over a developed mind. The boys observed them for over an hour and a quarter and tracked this strange light more than a half mile across a field. They described it as a golden egg shaped craft that hovered and made no sound and had a strange blue-green glow. They saw this craft again the next evening in the same vicinity. Their descriptions were similar and it seemed they were telling the truth of what they observed.

Text transcribed from the image:

It was a queer sight-did not see anything
until I looked at the ground there. I saw a
light, round and bright. It was about 15 to 30 feet 
from the ground. It lasted only a few seconds.
I did not see any shape to it. It just seemed
to be light only and no noise was heard.
It was over in a flash.

On September 9 at 11:15 P.M. CDT.
I was checking the door and saw
this light and could not understand
what it was. It was a queer sight and
I did not see anything approaching or
leaving the area.

Capt. This was about a  
object that was seen one night to 
south no light seen on it
looked to man 12 miles or
so out to slow over fields and  
trees it was a bright object,  
did not flash, and might had  
been a mile high and of a  
fairly large size. This fellow in  
the car could not give an exact   
distance that it was away from  
him, but when it left after several  
minutes going toward the Southwest  
it left a very bright light on the  
horizon, bright enough almost to  
light up the country side around it.  
It seemed to go straight up and  
away from him at a terrific rate  
of speed. He said this was a most  
unusual thing he had ever witnessed.  
I must have looked at this man  
seriously for he remarked that he had  
no reason to make up any story about  
this, that he actually did see this  
strange craft in the sky.

Transcription of the text:

This was in sight could make and did stay about 1500 feet at very high speed - not very far from us. It caused fear in me and my companion as it hovered and then shot straight up out of sight in about 3 seconds. This looks to me like we had a close encounter with some type of aerial object that could perform maneuvers not possible with any known aircraft.
Sincerely yours
