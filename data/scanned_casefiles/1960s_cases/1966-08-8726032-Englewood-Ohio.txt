The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. It appears to be an instructional page from a Project Blue Book document, with questions and instructions related to UFO sightings and observations.

Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows where the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 3 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 
After reading about sightings of unidentified objects in the sky in this area lately, I decided to report what I saw the other night. I have always been interested in this subject and what they could be, but never reported anything before. I saw a bright light in the sky which seemed to land in the field behind our house. I watched it for about 5 minutes and it appeared to be a glowing, oval-shaped object. It then rose up very slowly and flew off to the northwest at a high rate of speed. I could not make out any distinct shape or features, just a bright light. It did not make any sound that I could hear. I would like to know if anyone else in this area has reported seeing the same thing. I intend to watch more closely in the future if I should see anything again.
