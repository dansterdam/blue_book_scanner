11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer reported to the Duty Officer that he first sighted the object at 7:35PM on 28 Feb 69 and last sighted it 2 Mar 69 at 8:05PM. The report is confusing, and also has several conflicting points. The observer has seen several UFOs before.

The observer reported that he had sighted a disc-shaped object that had a dome on top and also an antenna. The observer estimated that the object traveled from 30 to 60 MPH and was about 30 ft away. The observer felt a vibration and a hum.

Some text is too faint or blurry to definitively read, so I've noted those sections as illegible or partially legible.


- page 28 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality. I can partially make out some text at the bottom of the page, but cannot confidently reproduce it. The page appears to be a graph or chart with vertical and horizontal axes, with numbers from 0-10 on the vertical axis and what seems to be dates or time markers on the horizontal axis. However, the specific details are not clear enough to read with certainty.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

(1) - Verified
(2) - Possible Identification

At the top right, partially legible: "INCIDENT HISTORY OF REPORT STATISTICS"

The document appears to be a grid/calendar-style form with numbered columns from 1-29, and rows with various labels/codes on the left side. Some grid squares have small marks or numbers in them.

At the bottom of the document, I can partially read:

USED:

Most of the text in the lower sections is too blurry or faint to confidently transcribe.

The image appears to be a grid-style document form with many empty boxes. Most of the text is too faint or blurry to read clearly. The only partially legible text I can make out is some text on the left side of the document, but it is not clear enough to confidently transcribe. The page number "31" is visible in the bottom right corner. The document looks like an official form or data collection sheet with a grid layout.

INTELLIGENCE REPORT
20 JAN 1960

[Several lines of text are blacked out/redacted]

After the 1964 light blue Mercury station wagon was initially sighted, the couple continued along the Lexington/Lincoln line (Route 125).

[More text is blacked out]

In this initial confirmation four white stationary lights were visible, evenly spaced and apparently connected by a dark mass. The sighting was soon movement.

The couple continued toward the intersection and along Route 65, looking back over their shoulder toward the house. Though the terrain opens up considerably as one approaches St. [rest of paragraph partially obscured/blacked out]

THE INVESTIGATION

Immediately upon returning home that evening [redacted] called at radio station WBZI and reported her sighting over the air. Moreover gave her my earlier's phone number. She then called [redacted] and noted some preliminary checks, and I arranged for an interview with the witnesses on Saturday, January 25.

I interviewed both witnesses at home in Lexington for about an hour. Both were courteous, willing to talk about the sighting, and helpful by giving me considerable detail. While they were quite certain about dimensional details of the report, but they at no time appeared to purposefully exaggerate anything. Their uncertainties did, when probed, reveal some hesitation about time, and the flashing white light. Neither mentioned this matter feature at the interview; it was confirmed in a phone call later.

[redacted] is not a particularly good observer. For the most part, her story was vague and uncertain. She seemed uncertain about details and was quite vague about the walking. Moreover she was sure she had never seen a UFO before.

[The rest of the text is as follows:]

(First paragraph appears partially cut off, but begins discussing an object and a helicopter)

...along the air traffic route with the witnesses, I was advised around the area and checked federal aviation and the air traffic control tower at Hanscom Field. This well-was then Leo only aircraft reported in the area. However, the tower by helicopters in the area at that time (Air General, a Coast Guard helicopter from Air Sea Rescue out of Boston), and the 102nd Air Police Squadron at the Cape Cod Air Force Station.

A review of the flights of helicopters in the area with negative results was made with the following (Westover), Marshall (Washington), North Adams (Boston), Westfield (Westover), Otis (Boston) [Reg. 128], 175 (Westover), J312 (Boston), Coast Guard and Lincoln police departments turned up no reports that night.

A woman at the Lincoln PD told me that an experimental plane crashed out of Hanscom the same or some of reports before. The plane was a Navy C-54 and was last heard from at 1740 and also at 1800 and 1900. Although, she reported two and a flashing white light, I called the flight dispatcher at Hanscom to check inquiry. He said the plane was out of service. One of these was a Navy transport plane, but could still be seen in the Boston area. However he heard of no sightings that night.

In conclusion, it is tempting to attribute the UFO to a conventional aircraft, possibly a helicopter because of its erratic movement and ground track. The test plane still must be considered but the reported altitude and speed are without parallel. If the Navy's opinion that, until a positive identification can be made, this report is a very ambiguous one.

Meteorite Shower
(from Page 1)

He reported back to the Center the recovery of 20 meteorite samples with a total weight of more than 100 kilo-grams. To everyone's excitement, the meteorites were identified as Type 3 carbonaceous chondrites, a rare kind of meteorite thought to contain traces of extra-terrestrial organic matter.

Dr. King immediately returned to the United States with samples of the material for analysis in laboratories at NASA and at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

At the Observatory, the samples went to Dr. Edward Frieman for radioisotopic measurements. According to Fireman, this analysis began less than 100 hours after the fragments fell from space, perhaps "the fastest it has ever been done."

Even before the first samples arrived in the labs, however, Dr. Frieman and Roy Clarke of the Smithsonian Institution's Division of Mineral Sciences, flew to Pueblito de Allende to search for additional fragments and to map the distribution of the fall over a 50-square-kilometer area.

Mason and Clarke reported back that they picked up 26 kilograms of fragments within the first three hours of their search. Chuck Tougas and Skip Schwartz from the SAO's Mr. Hopkins and Prairie Network respectively - both experienced meteorite hunters - also went into Central Mexico to gather eye-witness reports of the fireball sighting as an aid to scientists pinpointing its trajectory and possible origin in the solar system.

Both the Mason-Clarke and Tougas-Schwartz teams remained in the area about a week gathering information and additional samples.

The Pueblito de Allende Meteorite Shower on one score is the most valuable in history. For example, it is only the second time that a-blation samples from the atmosphere have been collected simultaneously with samples on the ground.

The success of the speedy meteorite recovery is due to many factors: the fast action (indeed, the very existence) of the Smithsonian Center for Short-Lived Phenomena; the cooperation of the Air Force, NASA, and USGS; the help of the Mexican people; and a good bit of luck!

STARS FELL
ON ALLENDE

Early the morning of February 8, a blinding blue-white fireball turned night into day over a 1000-mile path from southern Mexico to El Paso, Texas.

Hundreds of observers throughout Mexico reported seeing the brilliant flash of light and hearing a tremendous explosion. More important, a veritable shower of meteorite fragments fell on the little town of Pueblito de Allende in the plains of Central Mexico.

Within 12 hours after this spectacular event, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Center was coordinating the recovery of more than 100 kilograms of rare meteorital material for almost immediate analysis in several government laboratories.

The Center's first step was to get cooperation from the United States Air Force in collecting possible ablation samples from the fireball still present in the atmosphere. Air Force meteorologists calculated the wind direction and velocities at the time of fall and a B-57 was flown through the probable dust train, which by then had drifted over the Gulf of Mexico.

Samples of atmospheric dust collected by special filter traps aboard the B-57 were sent to the U.S. Geological Survey laboratory in Menlo Park, California, for analysis by Dr. Michael Carr.

At the same time, the Smithsonian Center, from its Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters, contacted Mexican officials and learned that possible fragments had been found on the ground.

The success of the speedy meteorite recovery is due to many factors: the fast action (indeed, the very existence) of the Smithsonian Center for Short-Lived Phenomena; the cooperation of the Air Force, NASA, and USGS; the help of the Mexican people; and a good bit of luck!

Dr. Albert King, a scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Manned Space Flight Center in Houston, Texas, traveled to Mexico and personally inspected the area of reported fall.

"Blinding Sky Fireball
Roars Across Southwest

CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (UPI) - A blinding fireball or meteor, believed to be a meteor, turned night into day across Mexico and the southwestern United States early Saturday then pounded to earth in a boom.

"The light was so brilliant we could see an ant walking on the floor," said Guillermo Ahumada, a Chihuahua newspaper editor.

"It was so bright we had to hide our eyes."

THE LIGHT from the fireball was sighted for at least 1,000 miles along a line stretching from central Arizona deep into the superstition-ridden cauldron of northern Mexico.

The people, especially the people in the small villages, are very alarmed," Jacobo Zabludovsky said in an announcement that the world will soon end.

Ahumada and other witnesses in the two countries described the suspected meteor thundering to earth over the impassable terrain of the Sierra Madre mountains south of Chihuahua and north of Durango, Mexico.

REPORTS FROM such mountain towns as Parral, Santa Barbara de Oro and Valle Allende said the Mexican residents saw the fireball and felt it pound to earth. Ahumada said the impact created "a tremendous tremor" that shook the ground for hundreds of miles to last that "some windows broke."

But Dr. Ronald Schorn, an astronomer with the Jet Propulsion lab at Pasadena, Calif., who was visiting the McDonald observatory at Fort Davis, said the fireball might have broken up and never landed. He said the tremors felt by residents might have been caused by a sonic boom created by the fireball streaking through the night sky.

"It was extremely bright," Schorn said. "We had high clouds in the area but it burned right through. It was much brighter than Halley's comet."

Reports from Parral, in the northern state of Chihuahua, said residents tumbled from their beds, thinking it was an earthquake.

Wallops Island. Similar tests were conducted here last February.

The dusk and dawn firings were sodium vapor experiments which generated reddish-orange clouds visible for hundreds of miles along the East Coast. Reports of sightings were received from Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Tennessee, and Indiana.

The other five payloads consisted of trimethylaluminum (TMA) which formed pale white clouds, less visible than the sodium.

In conjunction with the vapor series, the U. S. Army Ballistics Laboratory, Aberdeen, Maryland, fired six cesium experiments from Wallops in a comparative study of winds.

The cesium was carried in projectiles fired from a 7-inch gun barrel to an altitude of 330,000 feet. Liftoff times were 8:07 p.m., 10:24 p.m., 12:05 a.m., 2:05 a.m., 4:10 a.m., and 6:23 a.m. Three of these experiments were unsuccessful because the chemical was not ejected. Dispersion of the cesium, not visible to the unaided eye, is recorded by ground-based radar and Ionospheric Sounding Stations.

The launchings were conducted in cooperation with the GCA Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts, under contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES FEB. 3-9, 1969

The series in this publication are a
continuation of the principal charts
of the Weather Bureau publication
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar
Chart, the Higher and Lowest Temper-
ature Chart, and the Daily Pacific-
Atlantic Chart. The charts for one day
are arranged on a single page of this
publication. They are copied from offi-
cial weather maps prepared by the
National Weather and Oceanic Center,
Silver Spring. The symbols used on the
Surface Weather Map and the 500
Millibar Chart are the same as those
used previously in Daily Weather Map.
An explanatory sheet is available, and
single copies may be obtained without
charge by writing to: Environmental
Science Services Administration, Publi-
cations Center, AD 143, Rockville,
Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also
be ordered at a cost of $2.50 per 50
copies. Checks should be made payable
to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m./a.s.t. The track of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows, the locations of these
centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours
preceding the map time are indicated by
small black squares enclosing white
crosses. Areas of precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
reports that are printed here are only
a fraction of those that are included in
the operational weather maps, and on
which the analyses are based. Occa-
sional apparent discrepancies between
the printed station data and the analyses
result from those station reports that
cannot be included in the published
maps because of lack of space.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherms of the
500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m./a.s.t.
The height contours are shown as con-
tinuous lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are

shown as dashed lines, and are given
in degrees Celsius. The arrows
the wind direction and speed at
500-millibar level.

The Higher and Lowest Tem-
perature Chart shows the maxi-
mum and minimum values for the 24
period ending at 7:00 a.m./a.s.t.
Maximum temperatures are those
obtained from the Surface Weather
Map. The maximum temperature
noted shows the station location
where the maximum temperature is
higher than this point.

The Precipitation Amount and
Chart indicates by means of lines
the areas that had precipitation at
the 24 hours ending at 7:00
a.m./a.s.t. The lines are labeled in
hundredths of an inch or less. The
period. (Indicates total precipitation
lined. "T" indicates a trace of pre-
cipitation. Dashed lines show the
amount of snow on the ground in inches
at 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

WEATHER MAPS
ISSUES FEB. 3-9, 1969

This publication gives a
list of the principal parts
of the Surface Weather
Map, including the 500-
millibar chart, the Daily Precipitation Map, the 500 Millibar Constant Level Weather
Maps, and copies from other sources. It is published by the Environmental Science Services Administration. Pushbutton copies may also
be obtained from the same
source. Additional copies
should be made by each
resident of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents
station data and the analysis for 7:00
a.m., e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined
low pressure areas are indicated by
chains of arrows; the locations of those
centers of highs by 1, 2, and 16-hour
preceding maps are indicated by
small black H's. Precipitation are
indicated by shading. The weather
map is only a small part of the
analysis. Occasional apparent differences between
the plotted station data and the final
map result from these station reports
being received too late for inclusion.
The 500-Millibar Chart presents the
height contours and isotherms of the
500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t.
The height contours are shown as continuous lines, and are labeled in feet
above sea level. The isotherms are

shown as dashed lines, and are labeled
in degrees Celsius. The arrows show
the wind direction and speed at the
500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures for the 24-hour
period ending at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. for
points of the reporting points can be
obtained from the Surface Weather
Map. The maximum temperature is
plotted above the station together and
the minimum temperature is plotted
below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts
Chart indicates by means of shading
the areas that had precipitation during
the 24 hours preceding the 7:00 a.m.
amounts in inches to the nearest
hundredth of an inch are for the same
period. Precipitation totals are under
lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth
of snow on the ground in inches as of
7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1969

The rest of the text appears to be on weather maps with labels such as "LOW" and "HIGH", but the specific text on the contour lines and other details is too small or blurry to read clearly.


- page 78 -

The image appears to be a technical diagram with multiple contour or topographical-like maps/charts. The text is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and faded nature of the document. I can make out some very faint numbers like "287" and "284" in some of the circular contour areas, but most text is too blurry to definitively read. The diagram seems to show several circular and curved line patterns with concentric rings and numerical annotations.
