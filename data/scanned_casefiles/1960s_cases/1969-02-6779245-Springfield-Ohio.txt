Sighted by  (b) five  at  the Lincoln Line (Route 12) 
just north of Springfield, Ohio about 8:30 PM on January 30, 1969.  

The object was described as being approximately 200 ft diameter and was about 300-400 feet off the ground. It was elliptical in shape and was giving off a white-orange glow. The object was silent and did not have any visible markings.  

There were no witnesses in the car with the observer, but other observers saw the object from different locations. The object was observed for about 20-30 seconds and then accelerated and moved out of sight at a high rate of speed. 

The observer indicated that he had served in the military, was a former jet pilot, and was very familiar with aircraft. He stated he was certain this was not any known type of aircraft. The location of the observation was 126 degrees northwest of the Cambridge Radar Station.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

THE INVESTIGATION

Immediately upon returning home that evening I called USAF and reported the incident over the radio. We then proceeded to the site and conducted our investigation. The investigator interview with the witness reveals the following details:

The witness observed an unidentified object flying in the sky. The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a bright light. The witness observed the object for several minutes while looking up in the sky for the object.

The investigation revealed that the witness was credible and had a good reputation in the community. The witness appeared to be genuinely concerned about what was observed and wanted to share the information with the authorities. The witness was cooperative throughout the interview process and provided a detailed account of the incident.

After a thorough examination of the site and the witness's testimony, the investigator concluded that the incident was likely an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The investigator noted that the witness's description of the object and the circumstances surrounding the sighting were consistent with other similar reports received by the project.

The investigator further noted that the witness was not a particularly good observer and it was possible that the object was a conventional aircraft or some other known phenomenon. However, the investigator was unable to definitively identify the object based on the available information.

In conclusion, the investigator determined that the incident warranted further investigation and recommended that additional resources be allocated to continued monitoring and analysis of the case.

THE CONCLUSION, IS WARRANTING TO ATTRIBUTE THE UFO TO A CONVENTIONAL SOURCE BECEAUSE:

1. WAS FIRST OBSERVED FLYING FROM WEST TO EAST APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE ABOUT 2 MILES AND THEN MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE SOUTH. IT FLEW IN THIS DIRECTION ABOUT 1/2 MILE AND THEN MADE ANOTHER ABRUPT TURN TO THE EAST. IT CONTINUED ON THIS HEADING UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THIS TYPE FLIGHT PATTERN IS NOT CONSIDERED CONVENTIONAL FOR KNOWN AIRCRAFT. 

2. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THIS ALSO IS NOT A SIZE CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

3. DURING THE PORTION OF THE FLIGHT WHEN IT WAS OBSERVED FLYING FROM WEST TO EAST, THE OBJECT GAVE OFF A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT.

4. DURING THE FLIGHT, IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AT TIMES AND TO BE TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AT OTHER TIMES. THESE MANEUVERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONVENTIONAL FOR KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

IN CONCLUSION, IT IS WARRANTING TO ATTRIBUTE THE UFO TO A CONVENTIONAL SOURCE BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING:

1. THE FLIGHT PATTERN WAS ERRATIC AND NOT CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
2. THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT WAS LARGER THAN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
3. THE BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT WITHOUT ASSOCIATED SOUND IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
4. THE HOVERING AND HIGH SPEED MANEUVERS ARE NOT TYPICAL OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. Based on the text, this appears to be an article discussing a "Meteorite Shower" event that occurred on February 8, 1969, with details about the recovery and analysis of the meteorite samples.

STARS FELL ON ALLENDE

Early the morning of February 8, 1969, a brilliant fireball streaked across the sky from southern Mexico to El Paso, Texas. Hundreds of observers throughout Mexico reported seeing the brilliant flash of light and hearing a tremendous explosion. More important, a shower of meteoritic material fell on the little town of Pueblito Allende in the plains of Central Mexico.

Within 12 hours after this spectacular event, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Center for Short-Lived Phenomena was contacted by Mexican observers and learned that over 100 kilograms of meteoritic material for almost immediate analysis in several government laboratories.

The Mexican Air Force was the first step was to get the meteorite fragments from the United States Air Force in collecting possible station fragments from the fireball until present scientists could arrive and take over.

At the same time, the Smithsonian investigators from its Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters, contacted Mexican officials and learned that the fragments had been gathered by the local population and that they were being stored on the ground under armed guard. Independently, Dr. Albert King, a scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, traveled to Mexico and personally inspected the area of reported fall.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document with text describing a "Blinding Sky Fireball" that roared across Southwest. The text provides details about the event, including witness accounts and descriptions of the phenomenon.

"Blinding' Sky Fireball Roars Across Southwest

CHIHUAHUA, Mexico. A blinding blue-white fireball streaked across Southwest Texas and Mexico and the southern US at 7:15 P.M. Monday. Astronomers at McDonald Observatory and witnesses near El Paso, Texas, said the light was so brilliant it seemed to turn night into day for a moment. 

According to the report, a Chihuahua newspaper editor, said "They say this is an extraordinary thing that the world has never seen before." Witnesses in El Paso and other areas described the fireball streaking across the sky from west to east, leaving a trail of light in its wake that lasted for several seconds.

The report states that the light was so bright "we had to hide our eyes." Residents in several small villages near the point of explosion said the light was so intense it penetrated deep into the surrounding countryside, illuminating the area for a few moments. No aftereffects such as explosions or noise were reported, though some said there may have been sounds drowned out by the local commotion.

REPORTERS FROM such mountain towns as Portal, Sergio Guerrero da Gro and Guerrero all reported seeing the fireball, and residents of those areas said the light was bright enough to reveal "the smallest details of trees and houses." The report concludes that the fireball was "much brighter than Halley's comet.""

I received the attached newsclip on 2/18 and called the personnel police who in turn advised the name of the witness' company officer. He had received the same newsclip and the company's security people were notified. An investigation was made. The gas & electric company records showed Mobil Oil Company (622-6592) had investigated the unusual activity of lights in the Dedham area and stated that: The lights were a new booster station under construction by the company and these lights were used for security lighting at the site. The security guard on duty at the time saw the object at approximately 8:30 PM and called his superior who confirmed the sighting. The guard was told that the lights were from the new booster station and was satisfied that this explained the sighting. Some 9 days later, however, this same guard reported that at about 10:30 PM on the same night, he again saw the same or a similar object while on duty and reported it to his superior. Thus there appears to be some inconsistency in the explanations offered. The observer (witness) remained convinced that he had seen an unidentified flying object and that the explanation offered regarding the new booster station lights was not adequate. No vapor trail, no sound.

NEWS RELEASE
NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
WALLOPS STATION, WALLOPS ISLAND, VIRGINIA 23337
TELEPHONE: VALLEY 4-5311 - EXTS. 224 and 579
FOR RELEASE: FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1969

WALLOPS LAUNCHES 13 EXPERIMENTS
IN A 12-HOUR PERIOD

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducted seven chemical cloud experiments between sunset last night and dawn today from its Wallops Island, Virginia, Station.

Liftoff times were 6:11 p.m., 8:00 p.m., 10:19 p.m., 12:00 p.m. (midnight), 2:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., and 6:13 a.m.

Two-stage sounding rockets were used to carry these chemical payloads -- a Nike-Tomahawk for the first launch and Nike-Apaches for the other six launches.

Two different chemicals--sodium and trimethylaluminum (TMA)--were used in this series, to continue the study of wind structure in the upper atmosphere through a region from around 30 statute miles up to 186 miles. Data on wind conditions were obtained by photographing the motion of the trails from five camera sites within a 100-mile radius of the launches.

Wallops Island. Similar tests were conducted here last February.

The dusk and dawn firings were sodium vapor experiments which generated reddish-orange clouds visible for hundreds of miles along the East Coast. Reports of sightings were received from Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Tennessee, and Indiana.

The other five payloads consisted of trimethylaluminum (TMA) which formed pale white clouds, less visible than the sodium.

In conjunction with the vapor series, the U. S. Army Ballistics Laboratory, Aberdeen, Maryland, fired six cesium experiments from Wallops in a comparative study of winds. The cesium was carried in projectiles fired from a 7-inch gun barrel to an altitude of 330,000 feet. Liftoff times were 8:07 p.m., 10:24 p.m., 12:05 a.m., 2:05 a.m., 4:10 a.m., and 6:23 a.m. Three of these experiments were unsuccessful because the chemical was not ejected. Dispersion of the cesium, not visible to the unaided eye, is recorded by ground-based radar and ionospheric sounding stations.

The launchings were conducted in cooperation with the GCA Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts, under contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.

Transcribing the text from the document:

DAILY WEATHER MAPS 
WEEKLY SERIES FEB. 10-16, 1969

The Daily Weather Maps are prepared by the National Meteorological Center, National Weather Service, NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce, to provide a general description of the daily weather pattern over the United States and adjacent areas. They are part of the essential basic data required for weather analysis, forecasting, and research.

The maps show the location and movement of highs, lows, fronts, and other weather systems, and the amount and distribution of precipitation. They are used in conjunction with other meteorological data to determine the current state of the atmosphere and to forecast future weather conditions.

The information shown on these maps is based on observations made at 0000 GMT (6:00 p.m. EST the previous day). The maps are issued as early as possible each day to provide the latest available information for forecasting, climatology, and research.

The station model on the maps shows the local weather conditions at a particular map time and location. The station weather data elements depicted are: sky cover, ceiling height, visibility, precipitation, temperature, dew point, wind direction, and wind speed.

The maps are issued in two sizes - the sectional map (in this publication) and the full National map, which is available through the National Weather Records Center, Asheville, N.C. 28801.

Comments or suggestions for improving this product may be sent to the Director, National Meteorological Center, Washington, D.C. 20233.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES FEB. 17-23, 1969

The surface weather map presents the synoptic weather situation over a large area of the United States. The main features are the location and trend of pressure systems, fronts, and precipitation areas. Isobars are drawn at intervals of 4 millibars, and temperatures are in degrees F.

The precipitation chart shows the areas of precipitation that occurred during the preceding 24 hours, ending at 6:00 a.m. EST on the day of the map. The shaded areas indicate the amounts of precipitation in inches for the 24-hour period, as shown by the scale. These data are obtained from a large number of stations by the National Weather Service, and are labeled in the scale in inches.

The surface wind chart shows the wind direction and wind speed at a height of 10 meters above the ground. The wind direction is shown by the wind arrow, and the speed in knots is given by the barbs along the shaft. The length of the barbs indicates the speed, and a full barb represents 10 knots. The winds are based on observations made by the National Weather Service at the same time as the pressure data.

The picture shows a typical daily weather pattern for the continental United States during the winter season. The frontal systems, high and low pressure centers, and precipitation areas are the main features of interest. The presentation allows a synoptic view of weather conditions over a large area, and permits analysis of the weather trends and possible future developments.
