The text in the document reads as follows:

"Note added after main report typed:
This additional may have a bearing, although a rank, but moving lights have around the area of Indiana for some time; enclosed is a one correspondence card relevant to this possibility. There appears to be considerable evidence all in regard to the activities of the Warrick County Sheriff's department in Booneville, Dale and Evansville, that there are falls of glowing material that move through the air at various speeds. Officer told me that this has often made of seeing them, and this was years ago, so it is certainly no phenomena. I see no reason to doubt that some such phenomenon conceivably exists though it is difficult imagining at this institution recognition of it. I assume that the phenomenon is a supernatural or related to visits from of course i have no way of such other theories."

"The Thing" Draws National Attention
(Continued from page 1)
The object, a metallic, glowing saucer, was seen on the ground near Dale, Indiana, on May 15, 1964. Two witnesses said it was about 30 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. It drifted to the ground slowly, and then after ten minutes silently took off and disappeared at a fantastic speed. 
The incident received wide press coverage in the area. It was investigated by the Indianapolis Civil Defense and other agencies.
The text continues to describe the object, its appearance and behavior, as well as the reactions and investigations surrounding the sighting.

Grace Notes by G.S.H.
Was it a bird or a plane, or some unusual flying object?
The report received does not say what it was that was seen disappearing over the horizon. It was probably some sort of natural phenomena or some plane or other craft. The last said he was going back to Evansville, Indiana so we hope he has looked into it further.

Regular Air Force Commander on Investigations for UFO's
The United States Air Force usually receives reports of Unidentified Flying Objects from private citizens who claim to have seen strange objects in the sky. After these reports are received the Air Force investigates them, trying to determine what the objects were. This commander, talking about the Air Force's investigation of UFO reports, states some facts about what the Air Force does:
- The Air Force maintains a continuing program of investigation and analysis of UFO reports.
- Reports come from all over the United States, and from citizens of all walks of life.
- When a report is received, the Air Force tries to identify the object reported, determining if it was an aircraft, satellite, meteor, or something else.
- The Air Force uses information from its own observers, radar data, pilot reports, and other sources to evaluate the reports.
- Most reports can be explained as natural phenomena or man-made objects. However, a small percentage remain unexplained.
- The Air Force is interested in identifying any real threat to the United States, but has not found any evidence that UFOs pose a threat to national security.

Health Education Head Visits Spencer County
This section discusses a visit by the Health Education Head to Spencer County. It mentions the Tuberculosis Association was in charge of the visit, which was intended to be an educational event about health topics. The text indicates the visit was considered important, as it would provide an opportunity to educate the public on relevant health issues and studies in the local community.

"The thing at Dale draws national attention

In the above picture taken at the Gilbert Engelbrecht farm 2 1/2 miles south of Dale, Indiana on June 17, 1964 at about 9:00 pm central time, a large circxSlar shaped object was seen in the sky by Charles Engelbrecht, - taking notes is reporter Deace Dockins.

Charles Engelbrecht say, "My wife and I were sitting on the porch after supper when we noticed this object come into view fron the northwest. At first we thought it might be a star, but as it approached, we could see it was a very large round or oval shaped object which had a bright glow or light coming from it. The object seemed to be moving at a fairly high rate of speed, and it appeared to be about 700 to 800 feet in the air. The object continued traveling in a southeasterly direction and disappeared from view in about 30 seconds. The thing made no sound, and I think the reason we were able to see it so plainly was because the sky was very clear and the object had a bright glow which helped to make it stand out.

Deace Dockins, a reporter for the Dale Sun newspaper, states "I arrived at the Engelbrecht farm shortly after the sighting and talked with Charles Engelbrecht. I could tell he was quite excited over what he had seen, and he told me this was the first time in his life he had ever seen anything like this. Engelbrecht said he and his wife are quite sure the object was not an airplane, helicopter, satellite or anything like that. He said it was definitely something out of the ordinary, and he is convinced it was some type of unidentified flying object."

Engelbrecht said when the object disappeared, it seemed to just go straight up and out of sight. The object did not make any sound and didn't seem to have any wings or tail. Engelbrecht said there were no clouds in the sky at the time, and the object was clearly visible against the dark background. He said it was about the size of a large weather balloon, but was definitely not a balloon."

1. It was a clear, moonlight night. At about 9:00 o'clock I was standing in front of my home in Dale, Indiana, looking in a northwesterly direction. 

2. Suddenly, I noticed a bright light, which appeared to be moving in a north to south direction, approximately 20-25 degrees above the horizon. 

3. The object seemed circular in shape, emitting a bluish-white color, like a welding arc, and was quite bright. I estimated its size as about 6-8 feet in diameter and approximately 1/2 mile away. 

4. The object moved silently and smoothly at a rapid rate of speed, traveling from north to south, at an elevation of about 20 degrees. It covered the distance in about 5 seconds.

5. Grouping of markings or lights, clear definition, as if investigated, approximately 30 feet wide.

Information Onlys American UFO Committee Review, Vol 1, No 2, Sep 64

On 12 Aug 1964, Dale, Indiana: About 9 p.m. CHARLES SIZEMORE, 31, watched objects in the sky which seemed to be as far from each other as his house and the end of the next block. They appeared to be traveling at high altitudes above clouds, and were seen independently and in pairs. They made no sound, and appeared and disappeared intermittently. His daughter and her husband, who were with him, also observed the objects. Several other neighbors also witnessed the phenomenon. Sizemore said he did not see any distinguishing features such as lights or markings, and was unable to estimate the size or distance of the objects. However, he said they seemed to be a problem to the eye, being somewhat hazy or indistinct, as though affected by diffraction. No physical evidence was found. Sizemore is a graduate of Purdue University and is employed as a computer programmer. He impressed the investigators as being a reliable, intelligent observer. The objects were among the physical evidence here.

SAUCER LANDING IN INDIANA: A sensational news report from Corydon, Indiana, dated June 14th, tells of a landing quite similar to the famous Socorro, N.M. incident. On a farm five miles northwest of Dale, Indiana, an object landed at about 9 p.m. one night, and then flew away, leaving the smell of sulfur. The UFO left behind a burned spot, and the investigating Force Investigator came to the scene and interviewed Charles Engelbre 13-year-old youth who witnessed the landing. The investigator small pieces of metal from the burned spot. When examined under a glass, the metal appeared to be "grooved on the surface, like a walnut." The same UFO was seen in daylight, several hours earlier, by some youths who were on a fishing trip southeast of Rockport, Indiana. It was traveling at treetop level, and when it was within 200 yards of the man, it veered away, going out of sight at the same level. The UFO sound, and appeared to be 10 or 15 yards in diameter. It was visible for ten minutes. An unconfirmed report broadcast by a local radio station indicated that the object hit a farmhouse in the vicinity, causing a tiny blow up.

**OCR Output:**

Lack of space prevents us fr  
details, but we have recently learned of two more incidents in which evidence was apparently left behind by ying saucers, as in the U. J. case. The first incident occurred near Cannelton, Indiana, a few miles from Dale, where the sighting described in the middle of page 25, No UFO was seen, but mysterious altered circles were found in a hay field belonging to Merrell James Stark. These were described as "acid type burns."

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Dear Bill:

During the past week I have been very much concerned and upset because I learned last night from neighbors that fireworks were set off by some youngsters in part of the entertainment they provided for neighborhood guests--this is in the social news in the Dale Herald).

I don't know what kind of fireworks, but I seen some rocket-types that could very well have landed from that "pad" in the back yard; that also explains the noise loud enough to startle me for a moment.

Sgt. Trooper Frank J. Cook is interested--he's had some dealings with young people. 
(Incidentally, a justice of the peace or a justice of Carter Township--my old Kentucky friend, Saddler, said "Mother, why don't you call Oven like other mother's, and I've got a pipeline to the Chief of Police. You see, mother's department is very helpful in cases of instant news.)

In other developments, Police Chief Hughes' letter yesterday from Miller is very interesting which may interest you.

Sincerely,

"Subject: G. F. Dale, R.R. 4, Dale, Indiana. 

On 8/29/64, at 11:35 PM, all July 29, 1964, G. F. Dale, RR4, Dale, Indiana, reported sighting along his driveway room (13 yards from house). Dale claims he was attempting to retrieve his cows (which had escaped from pasture). As he was walking along, he observed a round, reddish-orange light in the sky. The light appeared to be about 300 yards to the northeast, and was about 10 to 15 feet off the ground. He estimated the diameter of the object to be about 15 to 20 feet. Dale watched the object for about 15 minutes, during which time it remained stationary. He then attempted to approach the light, but could not get any closer to it. The light then began to move, at a very rapid rate, and disappeared from sight in a northeasterly direction. Dale claimed that when the object was directly over his head, he could hear a humming sound, similar to a transformer. At the time of the sighting, the sky was clear and the moon was shining brightly.

Dale stated that he has served in the Armed Forces, and was stationed in France during W.W. II. He claims to have had no previous sightings of unidentified flying objects, and stated that he knows of no one else who observed the object on this occasion. Dale is employed as a welder, and has the reputation of being a reliable, sober, and truthful individual. The investigator has talked to Dale on several occasions, and has found him to be a very straightforward and credible witness.

It is the opinion of the investigator that Dale observed some type of unidentified flying object on the night of July 29, 1964."

Transcription of the text in the document:

At 0930 landing 6/8/64 was a small circular white light (about 5-6 feet) with an underside or bottom part that appeared to be blue in color. This object was seen hovering or landing on the 3/4 acre alfalfa field of Mrs. A. W. Cash and her son, who were all within a few hundred yards. The object was all well lighted around its edge, no pulsations or up and down movements, just a steady light. It remained on the ground for about 3-4 minutes, then shot up rapidly at an angle of about 60 degrees to the horizontal and disappeared in a few seconds. The witness stated it was about 3 feet above the ground while hovering. No sound was heard. The landing site showed no burn marks or physical trace and no radiation was detected. The investigator could find no evidence of any hoax or hallucination. The witness appeared to be sincere and credible. This case is being filed as UNKNOWN.
