Dear Sirs:

On the second Monday in November, 1961, I saw a "object" gliding silently at the top of trees in my yard. This old road that is alongside my house is the route of many sightings. I am certain that it was a flying saucer. If one negatives would not show it to be real I would send them to you.

Yours truly,

P.S. I am holding the last negatives in case you do not mention them."

Dear Sir:

On the second Monday in the month of November, 1961, I saw a object gliding silently through the sky. This object had a green luminescent glow. There were photos of the "UFO". They all took in the light of this object. I am sending the photos and negative that might help you determine if it was a flying saucer. If you want to see the other negatives write back to me and I will send them to you.

Yours very truly,

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
