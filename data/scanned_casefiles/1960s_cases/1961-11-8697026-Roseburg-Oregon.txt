Dear Sirs:

On the second Monday in the month of November, 1961, I saw a "object" gliding silently through sky. I had a camera in my hands at the time. I then took three photos of the "USO".

They all stood out in the light of this object. I am sending the photo and negative that might help you determine if it was a flying saucer. If you want to see the other negatives write back to me and I will send them to you.

Yours very truly,

P.S. I am holding the last negative in case you do not answer back.
