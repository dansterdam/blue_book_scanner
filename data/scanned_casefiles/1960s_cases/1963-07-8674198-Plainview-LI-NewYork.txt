Dear Mr.

Reference your letter with photographs, to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, now the Foreign Technology Division at Daytons, Ohio.

You numbered the figures on the photographs and identified them as #1, thru URO; #2, dirt and #3, scratches. Air Force concludes that #1 is a lens flare, light resulting from internal reflection between lens surfaces; #2, water spots on the negative; and #3, scratches.

Your photographs are attached.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

On July 15 of this year I was taking test exposures for the eclipse that will o cure on July 20. I was using a 3 inch telescope with a 1 1/2 inch finder. I attached a 35mm camera to the finder without using the camera's lens. I tried about ten different exposures. The time was about 5:45 PM. The same day I developed this film at normal time. After drying I printed the pictures, now I am very curious what figure No. 1 is. Please notify me as quickly as possible what it may be.

I enclose five 5 x 7 photographs. If more information is wanted call area code 51[illegible].

Very truly you[illegible]

Plainview L.I. N.Y.

There are some other partially legible markings on the right side of the image, but they are too blurry to confidently transcribe.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph with a large white/light area in the center and darker areas around the edges, with some markings or notations.
