There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a document, specifically a letter dated July 30, 1963 from Major Mason M. Jacks of the USAF Office of Information to someone named Mr. P. in Plainview, New York. The letter references photographs that were previously sent and provides some additional details about them.

Dear Mr. P.

Reference your letter with photographs to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, now the Foreign Technology Division.

You numbered the figures on the photographs and identified them. Your conclusion is that #1 is a satellite, #2 is a flying missile, and #3 scratches are native.

Your photographs are attached.

Sincerely,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Air Technical Intelligence Center in Dayton, Ohio, dated July 15, 1963, addressed to "Gentlemen" and describing a person's experience of taking test exposures during the solar eclipse on July 20th. The letter mentions that the person developed the film and is enclosing 5 x 7 photographs, and provides contact information for any further information that may be wanted.

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Dayton Ohio

Gentlemen:

On July 15 of this year I was taking test exposures for the eclipse that will occur on July 20. I was using a 3 inch telescope with a 1 1/4 inch finder. I attached a 35mm camera to the finder without the lens. I developed the film at normal time. After drying I printed the pictures, now I am very curious what figure No. 1 is. please figure and as quickly as possible what code I enclose five 5 x 7 photographs. If more information is wanted call [redacted].

Very truly yours,
[redacted]
