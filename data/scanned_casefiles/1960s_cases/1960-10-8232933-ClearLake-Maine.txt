1. The following is a summary of an incident reported to have occurred at Clear Lake, Maine on 5 October 1960.

a. The original report stated that an UFO fell to the ground from a great height and made a hole 44 inches in diameter in the ground. Two days later Boring 759, sent an EOD team to the scene of the incident. After closely looking the ground over, and probing for possible foreign objects, nothing could be found to substantiate the original report. After questioning the people at the scene, it was found that no one actually saw anything fall to the ground. One person said it sounded like dynamite going off, and he was the one who heard some items falling on the roof of a building. Other persons questioned stated that the noise sounded like gunshot reports.

b. The investigators could not find a hole as reported, or any object that was not supposed to be there. An attempt was not made to try to locate the source of the alleged explosion. This is not an AF responsibility. A good possibility is that a hunter had fired a shotgun in the direction of the buildings and the shot landed on the buildings.

CONFIDENTIAL                                                                25 October 1960

The following is a statement of the reconnaissance and ground, and
the findings pertaining to the incident reported to have happened 7
October 1960, Maine.

7 October 1960, during the following information:

At 1830 hours 7 October 1960, [redacted] from the Forestry Service,
reported to Sgt. [redacted] of the Maine State Police, that an unidentified object was seen to fall from the sky near
the Great Northern Paper Company Lumber Camp, at Clear Lake, Maine. This
object supposedly entered the earth near a mile from the camp at 1805
hours, 7 October 1960. It supposedly made a hole approximately 16 inches
in diameter. The area was relayed to the State Police Investigation
Section, during the 8 October 1960.

Arrangements were made for the Deputy Base Commander, [redacted] to
visit the scene and investigate.

[redacted] of the Great Northern Paper Company Lumber Camp, was contacted
and stated that he had heard a noise similar to an explosion, and that
he heard objects striking the roof of the office building at the camp.
Some rounded continued stated that he had sounded like gunshot reports.
The area around the camp was searched and nothing was discovered.
Reportedly lumping against the building were laying flat on the ground.
The area was probed and scanned with evidence and no answer to any
object falling in the area and no 16 inch hole as previously reported
could be found.

With the absence of any positive evidence and the inability to locate
recent marks and the boards could have been knocked over by the wind
or some other means, the trails or even accidentally knocked over. No one saw
anything falling, and no report of only heard marks has been made like an explosion
or crater.

Continued to listen for any additional information. No one observed anything falling,
and no further information could be obtained from the local personnel.
No damage was caused to any facility. The area did not seem to
be of any value for further investigation. The crater did not turn up a
hole or entry. The field is practically barren and was an open area in
natural state, with the exception of earth piled around the base of
building, which was done by the camp personnel.
