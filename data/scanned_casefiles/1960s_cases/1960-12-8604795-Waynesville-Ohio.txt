7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
1-2 min

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
varied

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj. appeared to move from S to S to W to
nearly overhead. After giving off a bright
glow, the light disappeared. Witness thought
light looked like an a/c landing light but
took the distance to any a/c facility too
great for this to be true.

11. COMMENTS
The description and course of this
object tend to indicate that the
object was probably an a/c. The fact
that may a/c with test configurations
fly from WPAFB tends to support this
possibility.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

MEMORANDUM FOR   AFCIN-NELH

SUBJECT:   UFOB

1.  By telephone at 2000 hours, 12 Dec 60, Mr. [redacted], Waynesville, Ohio, 13 miles SW of Dayton, Ohio, reported having seen a morning light at approximately 1845 hours, 12 Dec 60, in the direction of movement for one to two minutes being from the south to west, in near overhead. After flying out of light, the light disappeared. Though much like a single aircraft landing light, or traffic light the distance as between place of observation and an air facility was too great for use of landing lights. Additionally, similar flights descending similar direction over the past two and one half (who also witnessed this evening's event) over the past two summers.

2.  Though I ventured no opinions, I suggest it was an aircraft landing light. I thanked the observer and indicated that he might be contacted for additional information at a later time.

SUBJECT:  UFOB

1.  By telephone at 2030 hours, 12 Dec 60, Lt [redacted] of Dayton, Ohio, Waynesville, Ohio, reported having seen a moving light at approximately 1915 hours, 12 Dec 60, in the direction of movement for one to two minutes below the horizon near ground flow, the light appeared to last one to two minutes near ground flow, the light displaying characteristics much like a single aircraft landing lights, but the observer felt the distance and position of observation and facility to be too great for use of landing lights. Additionally, similar lights, describing similar characteristics, were also witnessed (who also witnessed this evening's event) over the past two summers.

2.  Though I ventured no opinion, I suggest it was an aircraft landing. I contacted the observer and indicated that he might be contacted for additional information at a later time.
