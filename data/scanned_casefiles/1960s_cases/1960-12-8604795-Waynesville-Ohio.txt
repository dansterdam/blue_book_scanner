MEMORANDUM FOR AGENT - IBTH
SUBJECT: UFOB

On 8 Dec 60, Mrs. A. W. Hogan, a resident of Waynesville, Ohio, 13 miles SE of Dayton, Ohio, reported to the Waynesville Police Department that she and her husband witnessed a bright light in the sky on the evening of 7 Dec 60. According to her statement, the light was hovering in the sky and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. Mrs. Hogan stated that the light was much brighter than stars or planets and that it was accompanied by a rumbling sound. She and her husband both witnessed this occurrence.

We enough I ventured no opinion. The witness is an apparently reliable housewife who has no reason to falsify her story. Any additional information that might be obtained concerning this incident would be appreciated.

The object appeared to be at approximately the same altitude as the radar set. This would indicate the object was approximately 1500 to 2000 ft. in altitude. The object traveled on a straight course and disappeared from view at approximately 1800. The object did not appear to have any external lights or markings and no sound was reported.
11. COMMENTS: The observation and course of this object tend to indicate that it was some type of missile or aircraft. However, no information is available to confirm or deny this conclusion.

MEMORANDUM FOR AUGUST STAAK:

Subject: UFO

1. On 8 DEC 60 I received a report from one of our intelligence agencies as follows: 14 Dec 60
At approximately 11:35 am, EST, on the above date, a local citizen of Waynesville, Ohio, approximately 30 miles south of Dayton, Ohio, observed a circular object in the sky over Waynesville. The object was approximately 50-60 feet in diameter and had a flat, grey, metallic-like surface. It was observed to make a swift, lateral movement, then stop momentarily, and then continue on a straight course in a southwesterly direction at a very high speed, estimated to be approximately 600-1,000 mph. The object was observed for approximately one minute. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the object did not resemble any known type of aircraft.

2. Though I was not an eyewitness, I feel that the observer's account appears to be credible, and I recommend that this matter be given additional study.
