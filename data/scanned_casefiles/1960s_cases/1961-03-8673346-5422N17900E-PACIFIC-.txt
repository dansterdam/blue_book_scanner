OTHER. ONE OBSERVER ASCRIBED THIS TO "THE WAY THEY MOVED", OTHER TO
"THE WAY INDIVIDUAL FRAGMENTS SEEMED TO CHANGE INTENSITY", BRIGHTNESS
WAS STRESSED BY BOTH, SAID TO BE BRIGHTER THAN STARS THEN CLEARLY
VISIBLE, AND BRIGHTER THAN ANY METEORITES EVER OBSERVED. SPEED OF TRAVEL
WAS SAID BY BOTH TO BE LESS THAN THAT EVER NOTED IN METEORITES.

II. A. WHAT FIRST CALLED OBSERVER'S ATTENTION TO THE OBJECT? FIRST
OBSERVER STATED THAN INITIAL SINGLE OBJECT "APPEARED" IN HIS FIELD OF
VISION, IT DID NOT PASS INTO FIELD OF VIEW FROM ABOVE. SECOND SAW ONLY
MULTIPLE OBJECTS. ( IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE BURST WHICH THE FIRST OBSERVER DESCRIBES MAY HAVE ATTRACTED ATTENTION OF SECOND OBSERVER.)

B. ANGLE OF ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH AT FIRST SIGHTING: FIRST OBS. PLUS 28
DEG. & 136T -- SECOND OBS. PLUS 20 DEG. & 136T.

C. ANGLE OF ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH AT DISAPPEARANCE: FIRST OBS. PLUS 5
DEG. & 136T--SECOND OBS. MINUS 5 DEG. 5 136T.
CFN 28 & 136T 20 & 126T 5 & 136T 5& 136T.

D. DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT PATH AND MANEUVERS: STRAIGHT DOWN WITH SMALL
(APPROX 5 DEG.) DRIFT FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. FIRST OBSERVER SAID THAT AFTER
ABOUT 5 DEGREES OF DESCENT THE SINGLE OBJECT BURST INTO MULTIPLE
FRAGMENTS WHICH SPREAD OUTWARD AND CONTINUED AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED.
SECOND OBSERVER SAID THE MANY FRAGMENTS WERE IN A A SCATTERED PATTERN WITH
SOME FOLLOWING BEHIND OTHERS.

E. MANNER OF DISAPPEARANCE: FIRST OBSERVER STATED THEY MIGHT HAVE PASSED

ESTIMATED BY FIRST OBSERVER AS APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF OCCURRENCE,
NOTHING WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY OR ON RADAR. RADAR WAS ON AT THE TIME OF
INITIAL SIGHTING, BUT NO TARGET WAS HELD.

ARE ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF NIGHTTIME CONDITIONS AND LIGHT EMITTED
1. BOTH OBSERVERS STATED THAT OBJECTS MOVED CONSIDERABLY SLOWER THAN
ANY PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED METEORITES, AND REDDISH CO                OR IS NOT COMMONLY

2. THE A/C PASSING JUST BEHIND THE OBSERVING A/C MAY HAVE ORIGINATED
A PYROTECHNIC SIGNAL, BUT THE REASON FOR DOING SO IS NOT APPARENT.
FIRST OBSERVER STATED IT WAS NOT LIKE ANY PYROTECHNIC HE HAD OBSERVED,
BUT BOTH LIKENED THE BURST ITSELF TO A FIREWORKS DISPLAY.
