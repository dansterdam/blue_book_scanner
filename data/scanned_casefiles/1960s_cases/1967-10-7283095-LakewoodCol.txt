On Oct. 10, 1967, I went out on the porch of my home to look at the sky, as I often do. This was about 8:30 p.m. I saw what appeared to be a silvery object, some distance away, about the size of a basketball. It just seemed to float in the sky and did not seem to use any kind of propulsion system. 

This object appeared suddenly and remained motionless for about 7 minutes. As I watched it, it moved rapidly to the left and up, then started a jerking motion, going up, down and sideways. It then moved very rapidly away to the north and out of sight.

I asked the man next door if he had seen it, as I had called his attention to it, but he said "I cannot tell you now," but he promised he would return. At that, he turned and went into his house.

This man is a retired military officer. He stood about seven feet in eighth. He had something on his shoulders that had four gold bars on them.

That is all I noticed about this man.

Your's truly,

Oct mar 23, 1967

Report of Investigation (Unidentified Flying Object)

To: CR

1. In accordance with para 5, LFTC Special Order M-104, 27 Oct 1967, an investigation was conducted to determine the facts and solicit additional information concerning the report of a UFO sighting on 9 Oct 1967.

2. The individual reporting the sighting, Mr. [redacted], is 22 years old, 5'8", approximately 140 pounds, married with two children and lives in Lakewood, Colorado. After serving 13 months in the United States Army, he was discharged for excessive fighting. He has held many jobs of short duration since his discharge. He appeared to be more nervous than the average individual. He did not complete high school but accomplished the equivalent through General Educational Development while serving at Fort Hood.

3. The location of the reported sighting, at 14th and Lamar Streets in the Lakewood section of Denver, is an unlighted, suburban area. Both streets are narrow, blacktops, pedestrian. Mr. [redacted] normally uses this route in traveling to and from his home and the South Broadway sausage factory.

4. On the night of the reported sighting Mr. [redacted] departed the South Broadway factory at the usual time and arrived home at the usual time, 2215-2230. His account of the incident is as follows:

I was driving up the street, north on Lamar in Lakewood, approximately 2130 hours, when I sighted an object in the north sky. I stopped the car and viewed the object. As I approached it, I could not see a star but I knew the direction. He asked me what the date was, I told him October 9th, 1967. He said, "Oh, in your primitive time." He asked me what I had in my mouth; I told him it was a toothpick.

- page 10 -

There is no photograph present in the image. It appears to be a typed document containing text describing a reported UFO sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

cigarette. He said, "Oh, one of your primitive vices." He asked me about the car and said, "Oh, your primitive mode of deduction." I was very shaken and asked who he was and where he was from. He said, "I cannot tell you now but I will return." The man was about three feet from my car, then walked about four more feet and disappeared - just vanished.

I then heard a noise, looked out of the car, and saw hovering overhead an object which was about the size of a football field. Then with a whining noise it went straight up in a slight northerly direction, joined two more objects which were hovering far overhead, took the lead position in a triangular formation, and disappeared at a tremendous speed to the north.

This was a normal looking man except that he was well over six feet tall. His jacket had some of a round tapering shape which seemed to be about a foot in diameter. It had sort of a Van Dyke type goatee except that it was separated from his face. I could barely see nothing but his voice while he was talking to me. It seemed like I was in sort of a trance. His facial features were normal except that they did not move when he talked. He didn't seem actually to speak; it seemed more like mental telepathy. It seemed like I was in a dream world.

5. Discussion:
a. The scene of the reported sighting permits several explanations for the sound disappearance of the individual who reportedly conversed with the witness. The witness was in his car, with a tree and light pole capable of concealing a man. This appears to be a point, from the center of the narrow road. The northwest corner of the intersection is also heavily wooded approaching four feet deep. This field is approximately 65 x 80 yards. There are telephone poles with multiple lines and power poles with heavy lines criss-crossing the intersection. A cluster-colored water tower and smoke stack are approximately 3/8 to 1/2 mile north-northwest of the intersection.
b. At the time of the reported sighting much publicity regarding UFOs had been generated by local news stories regarding the allegedly.

The image contains no photograph, only text. Here is the text found in the document:

mysterious death of a pony near Alamosa, Colorado. Several incidents were also reported involving pranks by college students who attempted to create illusions by sending objects aloft at night.

a. The investigating officer visited the area of the reported sighting and attempted to reconstruct the reported incident with the following results:

(1) With the vehicle driver's attention distracted for a moment, a person standing three feet from the vehicle on the driver's side can easily disappear from view.

(2) To observe an object the size of a football field the driver would have to lean far out of the window or well forward to see out of the windshield, at which point the object, depending on the height, would be many yards to the north of the intersection.

d. Mr. ****** appeared rational and sincere during the interview. He was quite adamant on particular points of his story. He had been contacted by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) and his statements as to the method of propulsion seemed colored by the book discussion APRO had given him. He stated that APRO had told him propulsion was similar to that of magnetic levitation or ionic propulsion. Mr. ****** was receptive to suggestion when approached with leading questions, and although he stated he was suspicious of the incident, he did not smoke or drink.

Mr. ****** seems to be moderately receptive to suggestion when approached with leading questions, and although he stated he was suspicious of the incident, he did not smoke or drink.

Text from the document:

accept the offer of a cigarette during the interview despite his apparent nervous state.

5. At the time of the initial report he made no mention of electrical interference; however, subsequent to his interrogation by APRO he stated that his car had stopped at the scene of the reported sighting. He could not remember if the engine or head lamps were inoperative at the same time.

6. Conclusion: In the opinion of the investigating officer Mr.____ was the victim of a hoax and/or his own overactive imagination. The area of the reported incident describes, and the mental condition of the individual as described by the APRO personnel would be a further explanation of the reported sighting.
