35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On Oct. 10, 1967, I saw at a block with a man, that I believe was a "sky genius".  I will describe this man as best as I can.

This man stood approximately three feet away from me, he did not seem to use his mouth to talk with.  He asked me what I was smoking; when I told him, he called it "primitive vice of an earth people".  I was sitting in my car at that time and he asked what it was; I told him that it was a car, and he called it a primitive form of transportation.  He also asked the date.  He also asked where the north star lies.

I asked who he was and where did he come from.  He said, "I cannot tell you now, but my colleagues will return."

At that, he turned and at about seven feet away disappeared.

This man was dressed in what would probably be called a grey business suit.  He stood about seven feet in eighth.  He had something on his shoulders that had four gold bars on them.

That is all I noticed about this man.

YOURS TRULY;

SUBJECT: Report of Investigation (Unidentified Flying Object)

TO: CR

1. In accordance with para 5, LTTC Special Order M-104, 27 Oct 1967, an investigation was conducted to determine the facts and collateral information concerning the report of a UFO sighting on 9 Oct 1967.

2. The individual reporting the sighting, Mr. [redacted] is 22 years old, 5' 8", approximately 140 pounds, married with two children, and employed by the Samsonite Corporation in Colorado. After serving 16 months in the United States Army, he was discharged for excessive fighting. He has held many jobs of short duration since his discharge. He appeared to be more nervous during the interview than the average individual. He did not complete high school but accomplished the equivalent through the General Educational Development test while serving at Fort Hood, Texas.

3. The location of the reported sighting, at 14th and Lamar Streets in the Lakewood section of Denver, is an unlighted, suburban area. Both streets are narrow, blacktop macadam. Mr. [redacted] habitually uses this route in traveling to and from his home at Street and the South Broadway Samsonite factory.

4. On the night of the reported sighting Mr. [redacted] departed the South Broadway factory at the usual time and arrived at home at the usual time of 2345-2350. His account of the incident is as follows:

I was driving up the street, north on Lamar in Lakewood, slowly so I could stop at the stop sign on 14th. I had just gotten off work. A man flagged me down asking for direction. He asked me where the North Star was. I pointed toward the north; I couldn't see the star but I knew the direction. He asked me what the date was; I told him October 9th, 1967. He said, "Oh, in your primitive time." He asked me what I had in my mouth; I told him it was a

cigarette. He said, "Oh, one of your primitive vices."

He asked me about the car and said, "Oh, your primitive mode of transportation." I was very shaken and asked who he was and where he was from. He said, "I cannot tell you now but my colleagues and I will return." The man was about three feet from my car, then walked about four more feet and disappeared - just vanished.

I then heard a noise, looked out of the car, and saw hovering overhead an object which was about the size of a football field. Then with a whining noise it went straight up in a slight northerly direction, joined two more objects which were hovering far overhead, took the lead position in a triangular formation, and disappeared at a tremendous speed to the north.

This was a normal looking man except that he was well over six feet tall. His jacket had sort of a round tapered thing on the shoulders with four gold bars on each shoulder. He had sort of a Van Dyke type goatee except it was separated in the middle. I could hear absolutely nothing but his voice while he was talking to me. It seemed like I was in sort of a trance. His facial features were normal except that they did not move when he talked. He didn't seem actually to speak; it seemed more like mental telepathy. It seemed like I was in a dream world.

5. Discussion:

a. The scene of the reported sighting permits several explanations for the rapid disappearance of the individual who reportedly conversed with [redacted]. The southwest corner of the intersection is weed covered, with a tree and light pole capable of concealing a man. This corner is, at most, two to three paces from the center of the narrow road. The northwest corner of the intersection is also heavily weeded approximately four feet deep. This field is approximately 65 x 80 yards. There are telephone poles with multiple lines and power poles with heavy lines crisscrossing the intersection. A silver-colored water tower and smokestack are approximately 3/8 to 1/2 mile north-northwest of the intersection.

b. At the time of the reported sighting much publicity regarding UFOs had been generated by local news stories regarding the allegedly

Here is the OCR text from the document:

mysterious death of a pony near Alamosa, Colorado. Several incidents were also reported involving pranks by college students who attempted to create illusions by sending objects aloft at night.

c. The investigating officer visited the area of the reported sighting and attempted to reconstruct the reported incident with the following results:

(1) With the vehicle driver's attention distracted for a moment, a person standing three feet from the vehicle on the driver's side can step back and apparently disappear from view.

(2) To observe an object the size of a football field the driver would have to lean far out of the window or well forward to see out of the windshield, at which point the object, depending on the height, would be many yards to the north of the intersection.

d. Mr. [redacted] appeared rational and sincere during the interview. He was quite adamant on particular points of his story. He had been contacted by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) and his statements as to the method of propulsion seemed colored by the book discussing UFOs that APRO had given him. He stated that APRO had placed him in a light trance and that his statements in this condition were essentially the same as those taken during normal consciousness. An interview with the same people, with questioning under deep hypnosis, is scheduled on or about 18 November 1967.

A Mr. [redacted], associated with APRO, contacted the Lowry AFB Command Post subsequent to the investigating officer's interview with Mr. [redacted] and advised that their psychologist, a Mr. Sprinkle, had examined Mr. [redacted] and found his information to be of dubious value. On his past present, apparently unstable behavior, Mr. [redacted] reportedly claimed that he had been robbed to satisfy an irate employer who had inquired as to why his vehicle was damaged. The robbery did not occur. He reported to the investigating officer that he had taken pictures of another UFO; however, neighbors who witnessed this incident say the UFOs were normal appearing stars. Mrs. [redacted] stated that Mr. [redacted] had proven so unreliable that APRO probably would not interview him further.

e. Mr. [redacted] seems to be moderately receptive to suggestion when approached with leading questions, and although he stated he was smoking at the time of the reported incident, he did not smoke or

accept the offer of a cigarette during the interview despite his apparent
nervous state.

5. At the time of the initial report he made no mention of electrical
interference; however, subsequent to his interrogation by APRO he
stated that the radio in his car had stopped at the scene of the reported
sighting. He could not remember if the engine or head lamps were
inoperative at the same time.

6. Conclusion: In the opinion of the investigating officer Mr. [redacted]
was the victim of a hoax and/or his own overactive imagination
exaggerating related incidents. The area of the reported incident
bears itself admittedly to the perpetuation of an illusion such as he
describes, and the mental condition of the individual as described by
the APRO personnel would be a further explanation of Mr. [redacted]
reported sighting.

STREET, NORTH ON LAMAR IN LAKEWOOD, SLOWLY SO I COULD STOP AT THE
STOP SIGN ON 14TH. I HAD JUST GOTTEN OFF WORK. A MAN FLAGGED ME
DOWN ASKING FOR DIRECTIONS. HE ASKED ME WHERE THE NORTH STAR WAS.

I POINTED TOWARD THE NORTH, I COULDN'T SEE THE STAR BUT I KNEW THE
DIRECTION. HE ASKED WHAT THE DATE WAS. I TOLD HIM OCTOBER 9, 1967.

HE SAID, OH, IN YOUR PRIMITIVE TIME. HE ASKED WHAT I HAD IN MY
MOUTH. I TOLD HIM A CIGARETTE. HE SAID, OH, ONE OF YOUR PRIMITIVE
VICES. HE ASKED ME ABOUT THE CAR, AND SAID, OH, YOUR PRIMITIVE MODE
OF TRANSPORTATION. I WAS VERY SHAKEN AND ASKED WHO HE WAS AND WHERE
HE WAS FROM. HE SAID, I CANNOT TELL YOU NOW BUT MY COLLEAGUES AND I
WILL RETURN. HE WAS ABOUT 3 FEET FROM THE CAR, WALKED ABOUT 4 MORE FEET
AWAY AND DISAPPEARED. JUST VANISHED. I THEN HEARD A NOISE
LOOKED OUT OF THE CAR AND SAW THE OBJECT HOVERING OVERHEAD, THEN
WITH A WHINING NOISE IT WENT STRAIGHT UP IN SLIGHT NORTHERLY
DIRECTION, JOINED 2 MORE OBJECTS WHICH WERE HOVERING FAR OVERHEAD.
