Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Mr. [Redacted] (Please pass to ATIC)
DATE: March 23, 1962

FROM: [Redacted]

SUBJECT: Three UFO's Observed at 10:45 a.m. EST, March 22, 1962

The following report was received last night by telephone from Mr. [Redacted], Washington Street, Hyde Park 36, Mass. [Redacted]

Mr. [Redacted] was looking to the north-west out of the window of an office building situated near the Cathedral in Boston. He noticed a jet plane traveling from the north-west till it passed over the building. Above the vapor trail of the plane he noticed three objects at a great height and though at first they were very bright, then he saw that they were definitely round, though small because of distance, and were moving in sudden darts at high speed and making sharp right-angled turns. They were silvery gray and shore brightly in the sunlight. These objects were in view for two or three minutes until they finally passed over the building and out of sight. He was alone in the room at the time.

[Redacted] accounts seemed sensible and authentic.
