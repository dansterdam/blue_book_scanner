The right or finally shape of the object is not successful. The fact that it would not move also can be explained with the distance, duration of the wind at the time (wind time) or the fact that it was flying with more might have prevented and fiber leaving it.

But this is an amazing thing that I cannot explain what is in the schedule speed with what kind of flow, I have some close anything go the life, you may comprehend also that through it goes precisely from higher to lower, it seems to me.

I was sitting in the pier fishing when my father and I was there. I looked up just in time to see what appeared to me a large ground object. It was very fast plus makes no sound as far I followed it. Object would it disappeared into the clouds to the west.

The image appears to be a grid-style document with very faint and mostly illegible text. The left side of the document has some darker, more visible vertical text, but the resolution and quality make most of the text unreadable. The document consists of numerous small grid boxes/cells across the entire page, with varying shades of gray and white. Without a clearer image, I cannot confidently transcribe the specific text.

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The image appears to be a grid or table-like document with varying shades of gray, but the specific text and details cannot be clearly read.

Here is the text from the document:

(f) 30,000' - 320 degrees - 28 Kts.
(g) 50,000' - 330 degrees - 33 Kts.
(3) Ceiling - None.
(4) Visibility - Unlimited.
(5) Amount of cloud coverage - 1/10 to 2/10 in Northeast to West quadrants.
(6) Thunderstorms in Northwest and West quadrants.
(7) Temperature gradient - 3.2 degrees F. @ 1,000'.

b. At the time the observation was made considerable thunderstorm activity in the New Orleans area was reported by the Base weather station. Lightning from cloud to cloud to ground was reported.

1. None.

j. One (1) T-29 aircraft from Keesler AFB was airborne in the local area at time of observation. Exact location unknown.

k. The observer reported an estimated speed that, in the opinion of the reporting officer, is far beyond the capability of the human eye to see. The object was visible for five to seven seconds, not satisfactorily timed, without prior warning, to give a comprehensive description. This observation is considered improbable and due to optical illusions brought about by the thunder storm, lightning and reflection off the existing cloud bank on the horizon in the direction of the sighting.

1. None.
