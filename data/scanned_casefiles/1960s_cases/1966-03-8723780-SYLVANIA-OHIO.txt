Dear Sirs:

On the month of March, I witnessed what I know was a UFO.
I took pictures of this strange object and had them developed.
After seeing this strange object a read in the paper all the other
stories so I did a paper and I'm still trying to gather information
on this subject.

Through all my studies I read that you where the center of
all the information gathered. Also through my research I read a
article that you sometimes send a copy of Bluebook. I was wondering if you would send me a copy along with any other information
that you can. I would appreciate it.

Sincerely yours,
