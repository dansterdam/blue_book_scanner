KIRKSVILLE DAILY
AND KIRKSVILLE DAILY NEWS
KIRKSVILLE, MISSOURI 63501, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1967

Numerous Reports of 'Flashing
Object' in Sky West of Kirksville
The unusual object in the sky 
west of Kirksville observed by 
numerous residents of Kirksville 
today was a weird-looking ob
ject, described as a "flashing 
light," visible for several min
utes.

At least eight area residents 
reported seeing the object be
tween 8 and 8:30 p.m. yesterday. 
The object was seen in the sky
over the Thousand Hills State Park 
area, about six miles west of
Kirksville.

Reports indicated the object
appeared to be "flashing" or "pul
sating" and was moving in a 
west-to-east direction. One wit
ness described it as "a bright 
light, like a star, only larger",
while another said it appeared to
be "an unusual object in the
sky."

Authorities said they received 
reports from a number of wit
nesses who refused to be identi
fied, because they fear they would
be "laughed at."

One woman, who did not wish to
be identified, said she saw the
object about a month after the
first incident reported in Kirks
ville area late last month. She
said the object seemed to be 
heading straight west when she
first observed it, and then turned
and went back east the way it
came.

"We didn't sell anybody to
come, we didn't give anybody to
come, we didn't tell anybody to
come", she said.

"No, I didn't call the sheriff's
office or the Missouri Highway
Patrol. Then it might be taken
more seriously."

Several persons, including 
teachers college students, who
did not wish to be identified, 
reported seeing the object.

It just looked like an odd-shaped
light in the sky, and much larger
than a star," said one witness.
"Several times the light would
grow brighter and then dimmer.
At times it seemed to stand still,
and at other times it would move
rapidly."

The object, according to wit
nesses, was first observed about
five or six blocks west of four
intersections in Kirksville.
"Then it seemed to move off to
the west, and we watched it a
few minutes, while it flashed and
changed position," the witness
said.

The object, the white lights could 
be clearly seen to full the exact 
shape. But a report came in saying
there was an unusual object in the
sky.

"We didn't call anybody, be
cause we didn't want people to 
think we were crazy."

"Now, I, me, too. Then it 
might be taken more seriously."

The 750th Radar Squadron of the
U.S. Air Force, Kirksville base,
was contacted, but they told re
porters they could not comment
on the incident "because of secu-
rity" regulations governing such
reports.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page describes various instructions and questions related to observing and reporting UFO sightings. For example, it asks the reader to imagine a scenario and place markers on a diagram to show the observed position and movement of a UFO. It also asks the reader to draw a picture that would show the motion of the observed object or objects.

Since there are no human faces or identities present in the image, I will proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. The object didn't change location - seemed about 1000 ft. above tallest building which is about 2 stories.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Only One
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJ: UFO Reporter 27 May 1957
On 23 Sep 67, Dr. J. Allen Hynek and 2nd Lt Marano spoke with Mrs. Kirksville, Missouri, regarding her unidentified observation, 27 May 67. Mrs. Kirksville said she was too interested in the observation since at first it looked like it could be the Moon, although it didn't look as round as usual, looked a little pear shaped on top. There was a dark streak across it but that could have been a cloud. The object was higher than any surrounding building. Dr. Hynek asked Mrs. Kirksville if she also observed the moon in addition to this object. Mrs. Kirksville replied no but the object she saw was about as bright as what the moon gets, but yet the object looked larger than the moon. Mrs. Kirksville was looking through a window on the southeast on the second floor. The object was really something in the sky with a dark streak across it, two inches wide, that was probably a cloud going over it. Dr. Hynek asked Mrs. Kirksville if she observed the people in the object. Mrs. Kirksville replied that she did not observe any people or things on the object, that the other lady had seen them but she nor the intern could see the people in the object. Out of the window you can look see or up, the object appeared in the southeast. The object had disappeared about an hour later when they went back to see if it was still there. Mrs. Kirksville said she did not see the moon. Dr. Hynek asked her if it was possible that this object was the moon. Mrs. Kirksville said, yes it was since that is what she thought it was at first, yes it could be the moon.

THEN THE OBSERVER NOTICED THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT ENTIRELY ROUND. IT HAD AN INDENT ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THEN THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT BECAME WHITE. IT WAS PALE PINK ABOUT SIX INCHES ON THE TOP AND PAGE 2 - 5000001 UNCLAS BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THE OBSERVER NOTICED SHE WAS LOOKING AT A MAN IN WHITE COAT WALKING AROUND INSIDE OF THE OBJECT. SHE SAID IT APPEARED AS IF SHE WAS LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW. THE OBSERVER COMPARED IT TO WATCHING TELEVISION. THE MAN WAS WALKING OVER TO WHAT SEEMED TO BE A BED AND PICKING OBJECTS OFF OF THE BED. THE MAN THEN DISAPPEARED AND HE, OR ANOTHER MAN REAPPEARED IN A TIGHT SUIT. THE MEN MOVED AS IF IN SLOW MOTION. AT THIS TIME A BLACK LINE STARTED TO MOVE ACROSS THE WHITE AREA. THE BLACK LINE HAD WHAT LOOKED LIKE YELLOW MARKINGS ON THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER.
