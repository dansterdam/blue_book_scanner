Numerous Reports of 'Flashing Object' In Sky West of Kirksville

The unidentified flying object continues to intrigue Kirksville today as numerous persons reported seeing a "flashing object" in the sky west of Kirksville Wednesday night.

At least eight area residents reported seeing a rod-shaped object with flashing lights in the west part of town and over the local State Park.

These are some of the reported incidents were reluctant to go quoted. Some simply refused to comment, saying "They'll tell you I'm crazy."

Mrs. George Wolf, 1116 S. Orchard, after similar reactions, said she was one who saw a multi-colored craft flow westward from the city.

Her husband, an employee of Missouri Power & Light Co., also saw the object.

Viewing it from their yard, Mrs. Wolf said the object descended at an apartment in their home, 1116 S. Orchard, near Teachers College students, who also saw it.

"My husband saw it first," said Mrs. Wolf. "It was a red and green light, now and then a white light. Now and then a green light would come on," she said.

"It traveled slowly. It first came up the block's west front house traveling west. Then it stopped," she said. "It appeared to be over Forest Lake."

"We watched it a few minutes, while it stayed there. Then it seemed to be turning, rising up and down." It would sort of

"Then the white lights would show. We weren't close enough to tell the exact shape, but it looked like it was built like a pyramid with a white-lighted peak on it."

"We didn't tell anybody because we didn't want people to think we were crazy," said Mrs. Wolf. "Then we decided to call the Manns.

"They watched it, too. Then it started moving in a circular and figure path toward the northwest and disappeared," the said.

That was Wednesday night about 8:00.

They called the 7800th Radar Squadron to report the incident. At the air base, Commander John Murdaugh, tied by the government, said every "UFO" could not comment today.

However, a source close to the base who refused to be identified said the base did receive a number of calls Wednesday night about an unusual object in the sky.

"At least we feel like we're not having hallucinations," said Mrs. Wolf, "because a number of other people have talked to reported seeing the thing."

The reports Wednesday night came about a month after the first known report of a UFO in the Kirksville area was made. However, the woman making the earlier report refused to be publicly identified, and the public was never aware of the Jan. 20 sighting here.

She said today the object she saw seemed to be a "W" upside-down which she viewed early that January morning.

She had taken her husband to work and was returning home when the multicolored object with red, gold, and blue lights came toward her.

"It was hovering within 15 minutes. I got out of the car to watch. It hovered around 150 or 200 feet off the ground."

"I got back into the car went down the street a block, and the thing continued hovering 150 feet or so off the ground. Then it turned and went north into the sky."

The picture seen in this object appeared to be a room with a man in white walking back and forth passing the window who seemed very busy. Later another man or the same one appeared in white tights or union suit, had long sleeves. He went floating through the air toward the corner where there seemed to be a bed.

As he seemed to be turning down sheets, I called other witnesses-by the time they appeared the picture was almost faded out in the window--then a black strip came across, or the door closed, then everything completely disappeared.

His movements were like slow moving pictures, swimming strokes or space walking.

MEMO FOR RECORD

Subj: UFO Reporter 27 May 1967

On 28 Sep 67, Dr. J. Allen Hynek and 2nd Lt Marano spoke with Mrs [redacted] of Kirksville, Missouri regarding her unidentified observation, 27 May 67. Mrs [redacted] said she was too interested in the observation since at first it looked like it could be the Moon, although it didn't look as round as usual, looked a little pear shaped on top. There was a dark streak across it but that could have been a cloud. The object was higher than any otherbuilding. Dr. Hynek asked Mrs [redacted] if she also observed the moon in addition to this object. Mrs [redacted] replied no but the object she saw was about as bright as what the moon gets, but yet the object looked larger than the moon. Mrs [redacted] was looking through a window on the southeast on the second floor. The object was really something in the sky with a dark streak across it, two inches wide, that was probably a cloud going over it. Dr. Hynek asked Mrs [redacted] if she observed the people in the object. Mrs [redacted] replied that she did not observed any people or things on the object, that the other lady had seen them but she nor the intern could see the people in the object. Out of the window you can look S-SW or W, the object appeared in the Southeast. The object had disappeared about an hour later when they went back to see if it was still there. Mrs [redacted] said she did not see the moon. Dr. Hynek asked her if it was possible that this object was the moon. Mrs [redacted] said, yes it was since that is what she thought it was at first, yes it could be the moon.
