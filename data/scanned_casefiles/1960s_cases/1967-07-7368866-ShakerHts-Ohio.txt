Dear sir,

My name is [redacted]
On the night of July 3rd I was sleeping out with my cousin on 3rd brother. We saw what we thought was a satellite but it turned around and flew away. At about 11:00 P.M. we saw about 15 to 25 U.F.O's. They were white and yellow. They were mostly hovering. When we called the weather bureau they said, "If they don't have landing gear we don't know what they are." Would you please send an explanation.

Yours Truly,
[signature redacted]
