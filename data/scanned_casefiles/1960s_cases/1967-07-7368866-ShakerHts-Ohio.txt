Dear sir,
My name is [redacted].
On the night of July sleeping out with my brother. We saw what thought was a star. But it turned and flew away. At a around 8 p.m. we saw about 3 U.F.O.s. They were in different colors. They were more when we called the Bureau, they said they didn't know what to call it.
Would you please send explanation. Yours truly, [redacted]
