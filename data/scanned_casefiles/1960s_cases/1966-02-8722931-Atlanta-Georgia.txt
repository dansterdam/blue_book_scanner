The object drew me in to look at it. I turned (illegible) the stone off the day (after midnight) and my brother came in my room and told me he heard something downstairs. I went downstairs and turned the lights on the stone off. I looked out the window because you can't go in the kitchen without seeing out the window and I saw it. I turned the stone off. It was still there still I looked at it, it drew me in it looking at it, then it moved back and forth and was gone.

I got sick I nearly fainted I had to sit down. I told my family, my people at school, and (illegible) and everyone thought I was nuts. I really did see this. It made me faint nearly within seconds, it was nothing like I had ever seen before.

Please write back and tell me how the (illegible) came out. It was like the thing wanted me to come downstairs to (illegible)

Thank you

Dear Sirs:

One morning on the morning of Feb. 4 on Friday I was sleeping. My brother said he heard something downstairs. So I got up and went downstairs the stove timer was on. I couldn't have been on because I had turned the stove off that afternoon.

I went downstairs turned off the stove and something caught my eye as I passed the window. The UFO made me look right into it for a while. The UFO was gray or silver in color. It was holding me and I felt faint. The object moved back and forth four times and then headed toward the west and disappeared. The UFO was nothing like I had ever seen before.

I reported my UFO to Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, Georgia and the main that I talked to took my name my telephone number and said he would send someone to talk to me. I never heard from them again.

I read in Reader's Digest last Night in the May Issue about Your reassearch you people are doing. So I thought I would send you the information myself rather than let Dobbins Air Force Base I really don't think they believe me.

Please right back and tell me what you think of what I saw. I know that it was some fluing object. It moved back and forth four times.

On the other sheet of paper I have drawn what I saw.

Yours Truly,
[signature redacted]
