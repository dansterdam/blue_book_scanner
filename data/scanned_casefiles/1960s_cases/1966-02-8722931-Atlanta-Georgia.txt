The object drew me in to look at it. I saw a blue object, slightly larger than a full moon, and my others came out and stood near me, who had not seen anything like what I saw. The object had a downwards movement and turned the edges on the slow, I looked out the window because you can't look at it without squinting your eyes out. It seemed to. It glowed red at was still the object I looked at, it drew me to it, staring at it, but the moon looked back and forth and was not afraid, I got sick I nearly fainted with had to sit down. I told my family, my people and Dadson and everyone thought I was nutty. I did see this. it made me faint nearly seconds. it was nothing like I had ever seen.

Please write back and tell me how the came out.

It was like the thing called and me to come investigate.

MAY 6, 1966

Miss M. Silson Ave. N.E. 30327
Atlanta, Georgia

Dear Sir,
On Friday, Feb. 4, 1966, as I was looking into the sky through the windows of the 6th floor apartment, I saw something in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, but then it came down very fast and stopped over my house. It hovered there for a while and then it took off very fast towards the East. It left no vapor trail. 
The next day, my brother-in-law called the Dobbins Air Force Base and reported what I had seen. They said in reply that they had no record of anything like that in their files.
I called several radio and TV stations, but they all said they had no information about it.
Please write back and tell me what you think of what I saw. I would be very interested in hearing your opinion. 
On the other sheet of paper is a copy of the letter I sent to the Air Force.
Yours truly,
M. Silson

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing diagrams and instructions for observers to sketch and document observed UFO sightings.

Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show the highest the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
