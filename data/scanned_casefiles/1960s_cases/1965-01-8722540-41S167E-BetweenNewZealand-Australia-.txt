Mystery Vapor Trails

The Melbourne, Australia Herald of 15 January 1965 carried an article about seven unexplained vapor trails observed 250 miles off the New Zealand Coast over the Tasman Sea at 6:55 p.m. on the 13th (Wednesday) of January. "The RAAF has failed to identify flying objects reported over the Tasman Sea on Wednesday night," the newspaper read.

Captain D. Shannon and the crew of Pis Electra which was at 20,000 ft. altitude reported seeing the trails at 35,000 feet, going west to east. The trails "seemed to split," into seven directions, indicating a flight formation, Shannon reported.

An RAAF spokesman in Canberra said no aircraft cleared officially from Australia in the area at the time. Inquiry had shown that no aircraft authorized to operate over or out of Australia could have been in the area at the time. The New Zealand Air Staff station at Brookvale had turned in no reports of unidentified objects.

This initial story was sadly lacking in detail but it indeed suggests that an experienced pilot would turn in a report on such a mundane item as contains when one would expect a pilot to expect to see contrails.

Regardless, on the same day the Syd Bay Sun carried an explanation, to wit: "The RAAF now believes that vapor trails..."

(Note: The last line appears to be cut off in the document)

Here is the OCR text from the document:

trails seen by Qantas pilots (apparently
others besides Shannon observed them—
P.I.) in the sky over Tasman were a
natural phenomenon. . . a Qantas official
said that "the Electra srew sighted what
appeared to be contrails from high-flying
planes."

Let us hope our Australian colleagues
were treated to a more detailed explana-
tion—and the planes should have been
identified.

Additional information reaching this
office indicates a radar confirmation of
the sighting but the location of the radar
was not made explicit—could have
been radar contact by Shannon's plane.
The clipping which divulged this infor-
mation did not specify.

News sources also said the report had
been officially explained as "ice crystals"
although two topranking RAAF officers
said the evidence indicated a formation
of military aircraft capable of hit a
speeds and long-range performance.
