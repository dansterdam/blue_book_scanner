Air Force Identifies 35 UFOs

NEW YORK, Nov. 2 (AP) - The Air Force claimed yesterday that it has identified 35 of the 41 unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sighted by western Long Island residents last month.

In a release by the Suffolk County Air Force Base, investigators said sightings had been identified as satellites, aircraft and stars, the brightest star in the sky was mistaken as a UFO by some makers of flying saucers.

The report said eight sightings reported Oct. 31 are still under investigation.

[There is also a small advertisement for "The Syrian Shish-Kebab" with a phone number 338-6660 located at 124 Cave Ave.]

Proposed reply to letter from

Dear Mr.

Reference your letter requesting information on unidentified flying object sightings in conjunction with the New York blackout in November 1965. The Air Force has received no reports that could be related to the blackout.

In regards to the reported sightings, the information will be added to the present data base; however, a comprehensive investigation is not possible since the sightings are outside the continental limits of the United States.

To Surface 19 Je 67

To Whom It May Concern,

I have been studying the 8 incident since 15 November in the northeastern United States and Canada and have worked about the possibility of the U.F.O.'s seeing the blackout so I would very gladly if you could send me some information for U.F.O.'s seen during the night of the 8 incident, and your opinion.

Sincerely Yours

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 11 October 1967

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: West Hyattsville, Maryland                DATE: 31 October 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF:                   IR:                   QUALITY: Poor
# MRS: 1 Polaroid Print (B & W)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-110 submitted by Major Quintanilla, ODER, to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. Source indicated the object was photographed at night from a distance of 50 yards. The camera focal length and image size indicates that if the object were located 50 yards from the camera position, the diameter would be in excess of 50 feet. The object and background appear very dark, indicating the photograph had been exposed poorly. Due to the extremely poor photographic quality, a satisfactory explanation for the imagery can not be ascertained.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 Feb 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I am afraid all my thoughts - tension + track of action would cover this page so I will want to say these are reasons for this report.

The only time this public (so my knowledge) has been exposed + definite proof to give it a desperate place is send it.

I would like to know if anyone else reported it.

Just as the object was disappearing, for the second time a jet was coming out of the southeast. Possibly the sky was so clear as could see the long shape of it. We watched it close across the sky + it would say, if you told a radius, at some length, etc. it disappeared about 5" north of the object.

From our view we saw all kinds of planes, jet streams etc. but the night even our sky was covered with jets - & have never seen anything like it before or since. Perhaps it had nothing to do with any one responding an object, but it sure makes me curious.

Please do not use my name.
Thank you!

sighting - 10/24/66 - Lawrence, Massachusetts

back to his office, grabbed a camera with telephoto lens and high-speed film and left the building 30 min to get closer to the object. He went to Tower Hill and took some pictures but upon arriving at the top of Tower Hill, the object was gone.

Later on about 2:30 AM, a frightened Mrs. [redacted] called again to report a bright white object high overhead. [redacted] noticed anything unusual. I assume that this second object was the same object Mrs. [redacted] had previously seen.

VALUATION:

A routine check of police blotters around the suburbs of Lawrence failed to turn up any significant reports or names of other witnesses. Unusually clear and sharp photographs of the object were not obtained. He seems apparent that the object was not a conventional astronomical phenomena. What [redacted] saw, it was local.

Following investigation, details of sighting suggest a hoax or misidentification. The home of the witness is located in a building by five homes owned by Georgetown Hill in an area known to have frequent astronomical misidentifications.

This image appears to be a detailed street map of an area, with grid coordinates from A to G and rows numbered 1 to 3. The map shows numerous street names and appears to be of West Hyattsville, Maryland. Some visible location names include:

- Immaculate Conception Cem
- St. Marys Cem
- Barker
- Bellevue
- Mt. Hope
- Metzen

The map has a grid layout with many intersecting streets and some cemetery and landmark annotations. There are some blacked-out sections at the top and bottom of the document. The map appears to be a vintage or historical document, likely from the 1960s based on the filename context.

Gambling Arrest In Ci[t]

ET Newsmen (And Others) Spot UFO

By LARRY BRETTS
of the Eagle-Tribune Staff

What is it?
That was it!
Whatever it was, it was here...
And then it left.

About 1 a.m. or shortly after, the first notice of IT came...
This reporter, trying to reach the North Reading and Reading police stations for a routine check, found the telephone lines out of order and failed, too.

But still, that isn't TOO strange.

While chasing down the telephone trouble (through the Boston exchange), an operator related that she had calls or a mysterious object in the air over Tower Hill.

One woman saw Tower Hill.

She described it as like a rock, silent at 15 degrees or up in the sky. She said it had blinking lights, some were bright, some were not.

Night Editor Walter J. Coleman went along the Eagle-Tribune line building and looked off in the direction of his home on Tower Hill. (He lives on Tower Street).

Coleman saw something. He described it as lights, apparently over the intersection of Broadway and Essex Street.

This reporter also went along on RT Radio and looked. There definitely was something in the distance in the direction of Broadway and Essex Street.

Armed with camera, extra coffee, and some courage, I set out to get a shot of the object. It was in sight as I left the building, but it soon disappeared mysteriously.

I toured Tower Hill, visited around by the water tower, but could see nothing.

The air was clear. From the top of the hill, I could see far and wide around the city. But there was nothing odd in the sky.

As I returned to the office, the telephone was waiting.

It was the day from Tower Street Hill. She too had last sight of the object at about the same time I was going off after it and it disappeared.

She was told to sit not too alone in her apartment.

But her fears were not calmed.

At 2:30 a.m. the radio again.

The original object we all had seen was not there anymore, but something was happening, she said.

This was "way up high...very high and very white."

The woman, now starting to sound slightly hysterical, was quoted up to Jones Street past Lenox and Essex Sts. and over to the south side street just as it starts to descend to the Merrimack River.

That "took up straight" the object.

What ever this was, it was stationary, but side very, very bright.

State police in Andover found nothing unusual. They had their patrol car out, but the trooper saw nothing.

But something was there.
Or had been there.

And something was - 5 - strange about it.

Eagle-Tribune police reporter Raymond M. Maynard and his wife saw something too.

From his home in North Andover, Maynard said his wife saw something of large, lighted object over Georges town bridge. 5 and 11 p.m.

And then, four to five hours later, this same (?) something was spotted by several persons, up in the air over Tower Hill.

What was it?

I don't believe it.
Guess it was, what they call
an Unidentified Flying Object.

Dear Miss

Your letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was forwarded to us for action.

Within the Department of Defense the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating reports on unidentified flying objects (UFO) and of evaluating any possible threat to national security that such objects might pose. The enclosed brochure will explain this program since its inception in 1947.

It would be very difficult to evaluate your sighting at this late date. Time is of the essence in reporting UFO sightings. However, I have enclosed FTD Form 164 which is used in making an official report to the Air Force. If you complete and forward this form, we will attempt to evaluate your sighting.

I have also enclosed other material pertaining to UFOs which I hope you will find informative.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Dear Sir,

On October 31, 1965 I was walking down from a friend's house and I spotted a U.F.O. It was about 8:23 at nite. At first I thought I was seeing things and then I realized I wasn't. I watched it for about 10 minutes until it flew away. It was a circular object, Ex. as in picture O—
