The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document page from Project 10073 Record. The document provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 31 Oct 66 in West Hyattsville, Maryland. The key details are:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 31 Oct 66
2. LOCATION: West Hyattsville, Maryland
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: Unknown
8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
9. CONCLUSION: Case: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Photo: INSUFFICIENT CLARITY

The document then provides a brief summary and analysis, stating that the object observed was "like a grayish donut" and that the witness did not report seeing it until 11 Jun 67, at which point he indicated it occurred on 31 Oct 66. The witness could not provide a return on the photo, and the photo was deemed to have insufficient clarity to identify the object.

1. This replies to your correspondence of June 17, 1967 to which your report of UFO observation of date 22 Dec 66 refers. AFRCA-4 31603621 and your photograph is inclosed.

2. Your photograph was submitted to photo analysis experts to determine whether evidence of the object which you photographed. Their analysis indicated that poor photographic quality and insufficient clarity prohibited meaningful analysis from establishing the identity or determining the nature of the object in the photograph. This is consistent with the difficulty of obtaining good photographic documentation of UFO sightings at that time.

Air Force identifies 10 UFOs
The Air Force has identified 10 unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over West Hyattsville, Maryland on 10-8-66. 
The objects were first reported and seen from the vicinity of the Washington, D.C., area at 8:40 p.m. and disappeared at 10:25 p.m. the same night. They were described as round, reddish-orange in color, and some were stationary, others in motion. The objects had no red, green, or white running lights. They were observed by several persons, including officers from the Maryland National Guard. The objects were tracked on radar at Ft. Belvoir, Va.
The Air Force determined the objects were balloons, and were weather balloons launched from the Chesapeake Bay area. The balloons were reflective and caught the evening sunlight, causing the reddish-orange glow.

The text on the page appears to be a proposed reply to a letter requesting information on unidentified flying object sightings related to the New York blackout in November 1965. The reply states that the Air Force has received no reports that could be related to the blackout, and that any information on reported sightings will be added to the present data base, although sightings outside the continental United States are not considered.

Proposed reply to letter from
Dear Mr. ____

Reference your letter requesting information on unidentified flying object sightings in connection with the New York blackout in November 1965. The Air Force has received no reports that could be related to the blackout.

In regards to the reported sightings, the information will be added to the present data base; however, a comprehensive investigation is not possible since the sightings are outside the continental limits of the United States.

In whom 24 May 1966

I have been studying the reports of the mysterious maneuvers and landings by what appears to be the "U.F.O.'s" coming the Gat est.

I believe many people have expressed their views on these maneuvers and they have been trying to clarify the misunderstanding of such maneuvers.

Many thanks for your interest.

About 200 mph What can not be north circuit circuit Toronto 14, Ontario

I know this would be difficult to believe as true, but I was actual witness to the flying motion of this craft. It was traveling with great speed and exhibited no visible means of propulsion. As it passed overhead all sound ceased except the muffled hum. I estimate the craft's speed to be about 200 mph. Its color was a dull gray or green and appeared to be metallic in nature. It was less than 200 feet above ground and passed directly over my head. 

Sincerely yours

The image appears to be a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book, an official US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The report is for a "unidentified flying object" photographed on 31 October 1966 in West Hyattsville, Maryland.

The report states that the photography is of "POOR" quality and that the object photographed is described as an "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT". The report indicates that the image was taken from a distance of approximately 50 yards from the camera and that the object's size and image size suggest it was located at that distance.

Performing OCR on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-74
DATE OF REPORT 11 October 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION West Hyattsville, Maryland 
DATE 31 October 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY AF 1 Polaroid Print (3 x 4)
QUALITY POOR
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-110 submitted by Major Quintanilla, 6515th Aero Tech Squadron, to determine the characterization of the object photographed.
ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. Source indicates the object photographed is a bright, circular of 50 yards. The camera's focal length and image size indicates that if the object were located 50 yards from the camera lens, it would have appeared very large and distinct. The object did not appear to be associated with any known aircraft or atmospheric phenomenon.

I have already filled out the form with full details of what I saw. The only thing additional I would like to add is that the object we saw was not a normal aircraft as we know it. It moved in an unusual manner - up, down, sideways - not like a plane. Also, the color was quite different from the normal planes we see. It was a bright luminous color, not the drab color of normal aircraft. The only time I have seen anything like it was one time when I did some flying, when we saw an unusual object in the sky that seemed to move in an unnatural way. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter further as I feel it is quite important.

The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper article from the "AWRENCE EAGLE-TRIBUNE" dated Friday, October 28, 1966. The article is titled "Gambling Arrest In City" and discusses a report by ET Newsmen (And Others) about spotting a UFO.

Here is the text transcribed from the article:

GAMBLING ARREST IN CITY
E-T NEWSMEN (AND OTHERS) SPOT UFO
By LARRY BRETTS
of the Eagle-Tribune Staff

What is it? What was it? It was something all right. So something about it was mighty strange.

About 10:30 pm. or shortly after, the first reports of it came.

A couple of boys, hanging around the North Reading and Reading police stations, saw a strange object hovering in the sky near the E-T Building and called up.

What they saw, they said, was a huge object, bright and luminous, hovering over the intersection of Broadway and Essex Street.

One of the boys, in fact, said he had run home and told his father, who had come to have a look.

But when the couple of boys called the E-T Building and looked, the strange brightly-lighted object was there no more. It had disappeared.

The boys said the object was quite close, hovering at about the top of the E-T Building, and at one time appeared to be shooting a beam of light down to the ground.

But when they rushed to the window, the object had disappeared. They could see nothing more.

A little later, Walter J. Columb, night editor, who was in the building and looked out, also reported seeing the strange object.

Columb saw something. He described it as a large, glowing, luminous object that was hovering over the intersection of Broadway and Essex Street.

He watched it for a time, until it suddenly disappeared. 

There was nothing odd in the town that night. As I was returning to the office, the Christian was yawning.

It was the body town Tower Hill, the one that had had that big fire a few weeks ago. Nothing happened around the same time I was passing out after it and it disappeared.

She was told that she was not seeing things. Raymond W. Maynard and his wife saw something too.

From his home in North Uni Grove, Maynard and his wife saw a large, lighted object over Georgetown, between 10 and 10:30 p.m. They called the police.

And there four to five hours later, it was spotted by several persons, over the vicinity of Tower Hill.

What was it? It too was strange, but the explanation, very, very bright.

State police in Bedford found the object to be the planet Venus, but the observer found radar indistinct. They had their doubts that this could have accounted for the sightings.

But something was there, or had been there.

October 31, 1966
Home: 8 05 57 AM
Dear Sir: 
I just heard of your article "sighting to say the least and I would like to comment on it, if possible.

I was in my car alone - about 1:30 AM on 10-2-66 - I was driving on the east bound lane of Kenmore Rd. just a few blocks from my home in West Hyattsville, Md. and approximately 1/2 mile from the District of Columbia line. I had just turned on my lights and was proceeding slowly as the area was not well lighted.

As I approached a curve in the road, I noticed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be directly ahead of me. As I rounded the curve, the light came into clearer view and I realized it was not a star or planet but some type of aircraft or object. It was hovering in the sky and appeared to be almost directly over Kenmore Rd. ahead of me. As I continued to approach it, the object seemed to move slightly off to the right and then back again to the left. I could distinctly see the outline of the object but it was difficult to determine the exact shape as the illumination seemed to be emanating from the entire craft or object rather than from a single source. At one point, the object appeared to be shaped like a diamond or triangle. There were no flashing lights or other identifying features.

I watched this object for approximately 5 minutes as I slowly approached it. When I was within a block or so of the object, it suddenly moved off to the east at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I continued driving slowly on Kenmore Rd. for a short distance and then turned off on another street leading to my home. I did not see the object again.

I am not a "sighter" or one who normally reports such incidents. In fact, this is the first time I have ever experienced anything like this in my life. I have given the details to you just as I recall them. I hope this information is of some use to you in your investigation of UFO sightings.

Dear Sir,

I am writing some more details and information concerning the unidentified flying object sighted in West Hyattsville, Maryland on October 3, 1966. As I already stated, I was observing things and when I realized I was seeing something, I watched it for some time.

The object appeared to be about 30 seconds in arc, shaped like an ellipse, and about 20-30 cm wide. It was completely silent. I watched it travel through the sky until it was lost from sight.

I have no explanation for what I saw, and I am unable to describe it as anything conventional. I hope this additional information is helpful to you.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

I made a miniature U.F.O. of what I saw. It had 3 bellows looking objects on the side and was very bright, illuminated on the outside. The whole object was about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and hovered about 4 minutes.

It just seemed to hover in mid-air. I made more observations as follows: at any time during the sighting a small door on the side would open and close rather fast. As you see, a big light came out of this door which lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.
