11. COMMENTS
Weather balloon released at
Santa Monica at 0900 would
have been in position. Altadena
is at the foothills of
mountain range rising no more
than 5,000 ft. This updraft
would cause the balloon to
rise rapidly. Case evaluated
as balloon sighting.

SUBJECT:    Unidentified Flying Objects Report

TO:         FTD
            Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The following Unidentified Flying Objects Report is submitted in
accordance with AFR 200-2.  The attached UFO worksheet includes
all information required by the prescribing directive.

a.  The UFO report was received by the investigating officer,
Capt Kenneth W. Schwoebel, 29 October 1962, at approximately 1600
hours FST.

b.  Sgt James S. Daley, Deputy John R. Hogan and two trustees,
East Altadena Drive, Altadena, California, viewed the unidentified
object in the air.  Deputy John R. Hogan was contacted on 30
October 1962 at 1200 hours FST and gave the following information:

(1) The above named four persons were standing outside
the east wing of the Sheriff's Building, Altadena, California,
observing and remarking on the clearness of the sky when the
object was first sighted.  The flight path appeared to be from
SSE to NNW at an estimated altitude between 10,000 and 20,000
feet.  At first the object appeared to be traveling slowly, but as
it went overhead the viewers stated that the speed of the object
seemed to suddenly increase rapidly.  The object was lost from
sight as it passed behind the Sheriff's Building.  The four
observers rushed through the building to the other side; however,
the object was not seen again.  Deputy Hogan at first estimated
the altitude of the object at 25,000 feet, while Sgt Daley believed
it to be between 10,000 and 20,000 feet.  Deputy Hogan later stated
he may have been in error on his estimate and agreed on the 10,000
feet altitude.

(2) At no time did any of the observers notice any tail,
trail or exhaust, or hear any sound coming from the object.

c.  Further research in this matter revealed:

Here is the text from the document:

(1) Sgt Daley reported the UFO by telephone to the Hollywood Office of Information, Secretary of the Air Force, and was referred to 1/Lt Peter J. Peary, Information Officer of LAADS, Norton Air Force Base, California, at approximately 1215 hours PST. The information was immediately forwarded to the Commander of LAADS, Senior Director of LAADS, Intelligence UFO Officer of LAADS. No intercept was sent out to investigate the UFO due to the three-hour lapse in time from first sighting by Sgt Daley and the three other observers.

(2) Deputy John R. Hogan explained that the Sheriff's Building in Altadena is at an approximate elevation of 1,500 feet and is situated at the foothills of the mountains toward the north, which rise abruptly to about 5,000 feet.

(3) Weather offices at San Diego Municipal, Long Beach, Los Angeles International and Santa Monica Airport were contacted for any information regarding weather balloon releases between 0800 and 0900 PST.

(4) The weather office at Santa Monica Airport released a weather balloon at 0900 hours, while at San Diego Airport a weather balloon was released at 0943 hours.

d. The comments of the preparing officer are:

(1) From all the information gathered, it would be most likely to assume and arrive at the conclusion that the UFO was very possibly a weather balloon. The fact that the object was white, bright in appearance, and the size and shape of a basketball would tend to lead towards this logical assumption. In addition, the weather balloon released from Santa Monica Airport was reported as being white in color and five to six feet in diameter.

(2) Santa Monica Airport is located WSW in a direct line at about 18 nautical miles from the Altadena Sheriff's Building. The wind at the time the object was sighted was very light and variable. It is entirely possible that the object sighted was this very balloon, which was blown inland by vagrant low level winds. The time of the balloon release and distance required to travel make this entirely possible.

(3) The observers stated that at first the object seemed to move rather slowly. Then as it came overhead, its speed increased very rapidly.

(4) It will be remembered that the Sheriff's Building is situated right at the Foothills of the sharply rising mountains. The wind at levels of 6,000 feet on up to 50,000 feet was a prevailing ESE wind. Therefore, the sudden increase in velocity of the object can be explained by the updraft currents of air being pushed aloft, which were caused by the orographic effect of the rising mountain ridges in the immediate background.

e. It is the opinion of the investigating officer that, based on the strength of the facts herein presented, the unidentified object in this case was a weather balloon.
