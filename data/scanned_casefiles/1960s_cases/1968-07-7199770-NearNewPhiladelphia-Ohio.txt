PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE OF TIME GROUP: 16 Jul 68
2. LOCATION: Near Philadelphia, Ohio
3. SOURCE: 
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 24 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE:
8. PHOTOS: □ Yes ■ No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: □ Yes ■ No
10. CONCLUSION: OTHER POSSIBLE PAPER BLOWING IN THE WIND
11. COMMENTS: SEE REVERSE SIDE.

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers sighted a white or silver object that traveled in a highly erratic flight path, was apparently seen descending in the eastern sky, and remained visible for 24 minutes.

COMMENTS: The observers can't seem to agree on what exactly the object looked like. (One said like a cigar or edge, one said saucer shaped, one said disc shaped). One observer stated that it was seen in the NE, one said the SE, and one didn't know. The near Philadelphia and Dover police departments both stated that no one had reported seeing anything similar to them. Meteorological data indicated that at 8:00 the surface (and upper air) wind was quite strong blowing in an easterly direction.

ATTN OF: Lt Col Smith

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting 1 July 1968

TO: TQFT (UFO)

1. In response to your request I have reviewed the data concerning the UFO sighting which occurred 1 July 1968 in New Philadelphia, Ohio.

2. The atmospheric data presented with the report does not indicate the existence of any unusual weather phenomena which could explain this sighting.

3. I noted a number of inconsistencies in the report. For example, one individual reported the movement of the object in a direction from that stated by the other observer. One report indicates the vehicle was partly cloudy. Another reports it was clear.

4. I note in one sketch of the location the observer depicts an underpass - it is entirely possible that light from the sun reflecting off the underpass structure could have caused a projection such as mentioned in these reports. A strong imagination would be necessary to interpret this as a UFO.

5. Two sentences in the report would appear to imply at least two of the observers are (so called) UFO fans. By this I am referring to Neumanatis' repeated comment that he would like to help you in your investigation, and Miss Sue Winters' remark "everyone thinks I am crazy."

6. In summary, as far as I am personally able to determine, it was, and will remain, a UFO.

ATTN: TWP/UFO Lt. Carson

1. Reference telephone conversations between Lt. AMANO and the undersigned 5 July 1968 concerning the report of an unidentified object entering the atmosphere over Central Pennsylvania about 212 hours 2 July 1968.

2. Attached are newspaper clippings from the 3 July 1968 morning and evening local Harrisburg, Pa. newspaper.

3. About 1700 hours, 5 July 1968, a Mr. SPPERLEY (phonetic) from the Smithsonian Institute, Meteor Research Section, telephoned the writer concerning this matter. Since he was not a civilian employee of this agency, I assume no official tie. He stated that he had talked to the same informant, and also referred him into the same information and also made some notes. For further information, I presume that your office and liaison with his office can take matters and possibly secure additional information. If this is not so, I would be interested in determining how we obtained his identity, and telephone number. If true, no reply is necessary.

Flaming Object Lights Sky, Startles Midstate Residents

A bright meteor-like object was flashed across the sky last night, far east as Harrisburg, starting residents of the Central Pennsylvania area for miles around.

Described as a fiery ball, it was seen in a certain blush white color rising in a northwest direction and bearing a fiery trail, was believed to have landed in the Seven Mountains, west of Lewistown, although eyewitnesses could not reveal the exact location.

Plane pilots as well as motorists and residents along outdoors noticed the object in the sky about 10:23 p.m., traveling northwest. The object was described as "larger than a full moon high in the sky."

State Police at Lewistown, where the object reportedly landed, said a man in a field on Seven Mountains had noticed the object and saw it apparently strike the ground, although they were unable to identify him.

The object was said to have been seen by persons in upstate New York, Northeastern Ohio and the Baltimore area, as well as from a space base. It indicated there was a low cloud cover at the time.

Edward Snyder, former president of the Astronomical Society of Harrisburg, did not see the object. Harrisburg newspapers, although several other members of the press called something which appeared to be a lighting flash at that time.

Naylor said that when a meteor strikes the Earth, it is called a meteorite and takes the name of the nearest place it strikes. For example, in this case, it would be the Lewistown Meteor.

He also cited the possibility of a meteor being a cause of the sighting and said some satellites had been launched that day. Many calls by curious persons were made to the Patriot and City Hall in an effort to determine the source of the flash.

IT WENT THAT WAY...

Fireball Takes
A Night Ride

Thousands of area residents awoke this morning to discover that for even a night's sleep would erase the memory of a flaming meteor they saw through last night's warm skies.

The meteor was sighted here at 9:24 p.m. and scores of residents immediately reported it to police, fire Evening News and radio and television news media.

For those who saw it, the meteor was reported as a large "ball of fire" with a long tail much like a comet.

DR. JOHN CAVANAUGH, curator of astronomy at Franklin and Marshall College, said the meteor was lightly colorful, apparently containing many minerals which provided its coloration.

Some resident sky watchers missed seeing the meteor, but reported the entire sky flashed white; some said their lawns were illuminated as if by bright daylight.

Jack Betz, of 500 Lancaster St., president of the Astronomical Society of Harrisburg, witnessed the spectacle from the society's observatory, a mile west of Lewisburg.

"IT WAS A TYPE of meteor classified as a fireball," he said. "It emitted a very intense pale, green light and it moved southeast to the northwest.

"After passing over the area where I was, it appeared to break up into smaller pieces and disappear into the cloud cover to the northwest."

Betz said the meteor was so bright that he was not hear anyone who heard a noise from the meteor. Betz said he has been observing sky phenomena for about 25 years and "that this is the first of this type I ever saw."

Approximately 100 preliminary reports from viewers said the meteor had landed north of Millersburg. State Police at Lykens, however, said this was not true.

Other reports had the meteor landing north of Marysville and as far north as Williamsport and Bloomsburg.

The document appears to be a "GENERAL PURPOSE WORK SHEET" with multiple rows and columns of numbers. The text at the bottom of the page reads "NATE FORM 10". The numbers in the columns are partially legible, but due to the image quality, some are difficult to read with complete certainty. The document seems to be a structured data sheet with various numerical entries across different columns.
