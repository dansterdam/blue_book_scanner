An orange and yellow object 1/2 as bright as moon was observed generally to S or a change location at 2110 local. Object was reported to have 5-6 similar objects around it. UFO alternately faded and grew brighter during observation.

11. COMMENTS
Highly probable that moon and bright star Alpha Leo (Regulus) were responsible for this sighting. Astronomical bodies were just rising and atmospheric refraction probably distorted them and contributed to misidentification. At this hour there was an occultation of Regulus.
