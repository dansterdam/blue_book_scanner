Miss Turnure/SAP-OIC/76526/Oct 4, 1967

Dear Mr [redacted]

We are returning the print that your friend, [redacted] of West Springfield, Massachusetts, sent to us. In order to make an accurate analysis of any photograph, we must have the original negative.

The spots that show in the print, you understand, might be a flaw in the printing or in the emulsion, or there may be an entirely different source of the spots that appear. For these reasons, we must have the original negative. If you care to send it to us, we shall try to get a determination of what these perplexing spots actually are; when we are finished, your negative would, of course, be returned to you.

In the meantime, we are sending you some material that may help you to determine what appears in your photograph.

Sincerely,

Photographs of UFO, 13 January 1967

Cleveland, Ohio 44104

1. Reference your unidentified photograph of 13 January 1967.
Your photograph was examined by photo analysis personnel with
the following results:

a. Examination of the submitted negative has negated retouching.
Source indicated the two "objects" were not visible when the general
outdoor scene was photographed. Both images are located in the
upper right portion of the frame. Each image appears as a white,
dimly illuminated ellipse, and exhibits no high order identification
than any foreground or background detail in the photography. Two
additional faint images are located below and adjacent to the two
indicated sources, and appear similar in configuration to the
subject imagery. This suggests the resultant imagery was probably
caused by a reflection of an artificial light source during exposure
or a double exposure.

2. We are returning your original color negative; thank you for
permitting the Air Force to analyze your negative.

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Westover AFB, Massachusetts DATE 13 January 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF________________ IR__________________ QUALITY Poor
P NRS One negative, two color prints

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-147 submitted by Major Quintanilla, AEDR, to determine the identity of the two purported objects photographed at Westover AFB, Massachusetts.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the submitted negative has negated retouching. Source indicated the two "objects" were not visible when the general outdoor scene was photographed. Both images are located in the upper right portion of the frame. Each image appears as a white, highly illuminated ellipse, and exhibits much higher definition than any foreground or background detail in the photography. Two additional faint images are located below and adjacent to the two indicates by source, and appear similar in configuration to the subject images. This suggests the resultant imagery was probably caused by a reflection or an artificial light source during exposure or a double exposure. NO SATISFACTORY explanation could be made for the imagery.
