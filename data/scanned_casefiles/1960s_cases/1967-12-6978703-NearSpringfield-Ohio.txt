about 1.5 seconds, or less, before I disappeared. The only conclusion we could come to was that it was a meteor that was just entering the earth's atmosphere. (This would account for its sudden appearance.) The object then proceeded to break up (into two large pieces) and then to disappear altogether. (The breaking up would account for its disappearance, and its glowing.) Since meteors do travel very fast, the speed would be accounted for. If this was a meteor, it was one of the largest I've ever heard of.

SUBJECT: UFO Reporting

TO: 1st FTD (TDA/Det Opr)
WPAFB, Ohio 45433

1. On 11 December 67, a UFO was sighted in West Berlin in the vicinity of Tempelhof Airport (also used as a USAF facility), by several guards and a duty officer. Guards on duty and Air Police attempted, unsuccessfully, to follow the object in cars. An extract from one of the followup reports stated, "a mix up with the moon is out of the question."

2. With the UFO Bible (AFR 80-17) in hand and a genuine "FTD" representative (Lt Col Klinikowski, BLO) physically in West Berlin, Det 3 was called on for advice and help. Specifically, it was politically impossible to say "sorry, we're not interested." Lt Col Klinikowski did what he could in taking down the first and second person reports of those individuals involved. Now the problem is where do we go from here?

3. AFR 80-17 specializes the Air Force's interest in only "UFO's over the United States"; yet states elsewhere of its interest "If the UFO is a possible threat to the United States". In this recent incident, the Director of Public Safety, US Mission, Berlin personally requested FTD's evaluation; they are concerned less the a potential security threat to their area of responsibilities. (Lt Col Klinikowski believes it was in fact the moon and reported as much to US Mission, Berlin.)

4. When several UFO incidents occurred 15 months ago, and Hq USAFE turned to Det 3 for the answer, we forwarded all data to FTD (TDE) for their review and action. Instead of an evaluation or sound advice we received a 4 sentence letter, telling Det 3 to keep out of the UFO business, not to bother Hq FTD with these matters as long as the sightings were outside "the Continental United States." Armed with this enlightening correspondence we had to brief the Chief of Staff, USAFE, on FTD's findings. It was rather discouraging and embarrassing for all concerned. For many months we've enjoyed relative quiet on this topic until 11 Dec 67, once again we are pressured into asking Hq FTD for assistance and advice.

5. Request you pass this data to the current FTD in-house OPR on UFO Reports, not so much for its evaluation as for help in furnishing Det 3 with a sound and reasonable professional approach in handling these matters in the future. The formula may be simple, but we need that formula so as not to decrease Det 3's stature in this theater.

1. The attached correspondence is forwarded for necessary action as requested in paragraph 5. Detachment 3 obviously has a problem which has both immediate and long range unfavorable ramifications. We ask that you provide TDA with specific advice and guidance relative to FTD Detachment participation and procedure in pursuing UFO incidences.

2. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.

IN SURE

1. Reference TDA (DET OPR) letter of April 5, 1969, subject "UFO
Reporting," in which they were advised in letter Detachment 3,
dated 8 January 1968, subject "UFO Reporting." It is apparent that
the Detachment has a problem, however, it appears to be political
and this type of advice is not available from the UFO OPR. AFR 80-17
and Change 1, thereto, specifically states "this regulation
establishes the Air Force program for investigating and analyzing
UFOs over the United States." The Deputy Chief of Staff for Research
and Development at Hq USAF is not in favor of investigating UFO
reports which occur on foreign soil. If the Facility Commander feels
that his facility is threatened by an unidentified flying object,
then he should take immediate steps to inform his Air Defense Forces.

2. TDPT cannot offer any guidance for the investigation of UFOs in
continental Europe because AFR 80-17 is not seeking UFO reports which
occur outside the continental limits of the United States.

SUBJECT:   Unidentified Flying Object Over the
           Area of Tempelhof

1. a)   Police Inspection Tempelhof - Wieserodt -
         telephone at 0845 hrs

         On Dec 11, 1967 about 0140 hrs, the Army guard at the
         radar systems of Marienfelde watched an unidentified object
         flying to the airport Tempelhof. The flying object was observed
         for 15 minutes by several guards of the IP-Luft (industrial police
         air) floating over the airport Tempelhof. Toward the end of that
         period the object glided about 50-70 m high over the departure hall
         of the airport.   There the object was also observed by the duty
         officer of the IP-Luft at Columbiadamm.

         Description of the flying object: round, orange colored.

         Then the unidentified flying object disappeared.
         No sound coming from that object was heard.   Radio operations
         center was informed.

b)      IP-Luft - Mergener - on telephone inquiry:

         Above statements are confirmed.

         The flying object had the form of an average orange,
         flew without lights and had a diameter of about 5-10 meters.

         The airport - military side - had been alerted by an
         soldier of the Air Force who was on duty at the old airport
         (firing range).   According to the statement of this soldier
         the flying object came directly towards him and flew then away
         from him towards hangar B, old control tower, where it stood
         for 10-15 minutes about 70 m high.

         Guards on duty of IP-Luft and Air Force police tried to
         follow the unidentified flying object by cars, however, discontinued
         their plan when they reached Columbiadamm, because the object flew
         away in a north-western direction.

         A mix-up with the moon is out of the question, since he
         had already disappeared.   Whether the flying object was registered
         by the radar systems Marienfelde, Teufelsberg and airport Tempelhof,
         is not known, because these installations work "strictly secret"
         and give no information.   In case details will become known, PGPS
         will be informed.

c)      Radio Operations Center on telephone inquiry:

         The radio operations center was informed by the duty
         officer of IP-Luft.   Inquiries made at the police bases along the
         demarcation line with several radio patrol cars did not confirm
         the reports.

after loosing sight (SR. INSPECTOR) 
went around the hangar to the 
opposite side to see if we could 
see it from there. We never observed 
the object again after that.

The Base Weather station stated

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
