REPORT NO: U-04288-61
PAGE: 3 OF 3 PAGES

a. No unusual activity or conditions in area.

1. N/A

j. Checked with Goodfellow, AFB, SAN ANGELO, Texas and were informed that no balloons were released by them - also asked local weather authorities and were informed no balloons were released.

k. This reported sighting is one of the most accurate we have received in the civilian reporting; the sighting was investigated by Sgt Thomas W. Williams, TUSAG, USAF, Texarkana, Texas, who followed the forms contained in Paragraph 19, AFR 200-2. Since it was necessary to hear questionnaire, I also contacted the Ft. Am base and they in turn contacted both Fort Worth and Dallas, and they advised no further information is there any physical evidence.

After preliminary analysis it is the opinion of the preparing officer that these numerous reported sightings in this area in the past have been weather balloons this sighting was also some type of balloon.
