Gentlemen:

I wish to report to you that on the evening of Wednesday, August 11, 1965, at approximately 11:15 P.M., I saw what appeared to me to be an unidentified flying object.

My point of observation was in the community of Far Rockaway, New York. I was facing in an Easterly direction gazing upward. I saw an object of bright intensity move through the sky at an extremely fast rate of speed for about one (1) second and disappear. The glow from the object appeared electric bulb however to be like a small, bright, intense electric bulb however the shape of such object was impossible to determine because of the fast rate of speed at which it moved.

I have seen "shooting stars" on many occasions being that I live at the beach and quite often we are on the boardwalk and have occasion to see such phenomena. However, the object that I saw was much larger and appeared to be much closer in the heavens than any star could possibly be.

The object disappeared as quickly as it appeared and seemed to cover a distance of what I can only estimate to be a yard in length compared with the course at which it was traveling in the sky and its distance from the earth.

Needless to say, I consider myself a somewhat reliable observer and I felt that this information should be communicated to you.

Trusting that the aforesaid information will be directed to the proper authorities, I remain,

Sincerely yours,
SSO:ah
