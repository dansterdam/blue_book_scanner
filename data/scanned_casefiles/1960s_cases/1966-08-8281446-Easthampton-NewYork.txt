Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects
Seagler, Ohio
August 16, 1966

Dear Sir,
On August 10, 1966, I would like to call your attention to the information concerning some Unidentified Flying Objects observed on the night of August 7, 1966, in the skies over Seagler, Ohio.
We observed the objects about 8:45 p.m., on the above date, and they were in the skies for about 45 minutes. The objects were round in shape, gave off a bright reddish-orange light, and seemed to be hovering at times and then darting off at high speeds.  As soon as I first saw the objects, I called my neighbor, Mrs. [REDACTED], and she also observed the objects from her home. We watched the objects for several minutes, and another neighbor, Mr. [REDACTED], also came out and observed the objects. The objects were seen by us and others, and they were very, very unusual and completely unlike any aircraft I have ever seen before.
I would appreciate it if you would investigate this matter further. I am willing to cooperate in any way I can to help solve this mystery.
Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHAT IT APPEARED TO DO, IF IT CHANGED SHAPE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS, SPEED, OR DIRECTION, AND HOW LONG IT WAS VISIBLE.
All I can say is because of the nature of the object I was observing I hesitate to draw a picture because it would be difficult to reproduce the apparent changing, almost random nature of this object. It seemed to change size and shape in a rather erratic manner and would appear to blink on and off. I had the impression that it was an intelligently guided craft, but its maneuverability and apparent size changes seemed to defy explanation. It was visible for about 10 to 15 minutes as I could observe it before it went behind some trees and I lost sight of it. There was no sound that I could detect during the sighting. I will add that I have had some training and background in observing astronomical and meteorological phenomena, and this object did not conform to anything I have ever seen before in that area. I would say that this was a very unusual and puzzling experience for me.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that includes a form with various questions about a UFO sighting.

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? YES
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME? YES
SPEED UP AND THEN SLOW DOWN AWAY? YES
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE? NO
CHANGE COLOR? UNKNOWN
GIVE OFF SMOKE? NO
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS? UNKNOWN
CHANGE SHAPE? UNKNOWN
FLASH OR PULSATE? NO
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR? NO
SPIN OR WOBBLE? UNKNOWN
MAKE A NOISE? UNKNOWN
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE? UNKNOWN
IS WHAT THE WITNESS ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
The witness provided additional details about the object, which was described as "yellowish-white", traveling at a high speed, and having some kind of "glow" or illumination about it.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
According to the witness, the object "descended at a rapid rate behind a large hill". It disappeared behind the hill and was not seen again after that.

DID THE PHENOMENON SEEM TO BE GOING IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, ETC.?
The witness stated that the object "passed the tree line at a very high rate of speed". This suggests the object was visible moving in front of the tree line or other landscape features.

Text extracted from the document:

for the sake of clarity, I am putting the last question on your questionnaire on 6 Sept 1966. written answer is "what I know to the best of my knowledge".

The date of this is written 6 Sept 1966. This is an estimation which I believe comes rather close to the actual date of the sighting of the phenomenon. I have been waiting for some government agency to get in touch with me and certainly find out the exact date. It seems like it was on the afternoon of that date at about 5:45 P.M. in my hometown. 

I am from Tonpkinsville, Ky. in the summer of 1966. A thing that looked to me like a parachute dropped down slowly on to the highline across the road from where I was. It seemed to have lights on the edge. I finished the job, drove the tractor and sprayer into Tompkinsville, and bummed a ride home to call the State Police and the local Air Force Base and report it.They said they had no report of a parachutist in the area at that time. I was 37 years old at the time and because of the hour (between 6:30-10:00 p.m.) I had my wife as a witness. After some time checking, I looked through the kitchen window and saw the car was facing south, I got in and started the engine. the car was facing south but I got it turned around to face north. I let the engine idle for a while and then turned it off. I don't know what possessed me to do that. I thought that whatever it was, it might come back. The car was facing north. I got out of the car and pushed the button that lowers the windows. I think that whatever it was, it might come back. Although it was dark, I thought that whatever it was, it might be able to see me through the windshield if the windows were up. I took my position under my car near the rear tire. I got out to get a better look and see if I could see whatever it was again. I couldn't really say for sure because everything went out of my sight - I could see two horizontal lines running parallel above the trees. I could not determine the exact focus of the points of light. It seems to me they were in a horizontal line. In order to get an approximate position relative to the ground etc., in order to get an approximate position I stood up and turned my head from left to right but whatever it was had disappeared. I can't really say for sure because everything went out of my sight. After waiting a little while I got back into the car and finally went home. This was the last that I saw of it.

Whatever it was, it was quite close to me and I have very good eyes. it was a quite strange and to me, unexplainable. The description in reporting this now does not do justice to the sensation that I had at the time though my memory of the details is not too clear. I wish that I could be more emphatic, but those are the facts as I recall them. This is one more sighting on that particular night in August.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an official U.S. Air Force UFO reporting form. The form appears to be asking various questions about the UFO sighting, such as whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or changed in appearance. It also asks the witness to describe the object in terms of its size, color, and other details.

This report contains some very interesting data and may be indicative of airborne vehicles of some kind. The objects described do not seem to fit the description of any conventional aircraft. The witness appears to have observed the objects closely and provided a detailed account of their appearance and behavior. Although there is no photographic evidence, the narrative description is compelling and warrants further investigation.

The image does not contain any photographs, only a handwritten form with text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 Feb 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

On Feb 7, 1967 I saw a metallic disc-shaped object which appeared to be about 50 ft in diameter. It was hovering about 70 ft above the ground at the edge of a forest near my home in Easthampton, New York. The object was brilliant white in color and seemed to be shimmering or vibrating. It made no sound and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. I watched it for about 2 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I was very close to the object and was able to observe it clearly. It was definitely not a conventional aircraft or any known type of aircraft that I am familiar with. I am quite convinced that what I saw was a genuine unidentified flying object. I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have about my sighting.
