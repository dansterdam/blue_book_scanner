10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Single bright star-colored object, elongated, about 3 feet in length with vapor trail above object observed for 30 minutes prior to dawn. Faded with rising of sun. Object at 25 dgr elevation in SE.

11. COMMENTS
Rpt that Operation Firefly in progress at Eglin. This operation accounts for the vapor trails. Star Spica just rising in SE. Would be dimmed with rising of sun 30 minutes later. However, the object was reported at a 25 dgr elevation & this would tend to rule out astro bodies. Since 1st magnitude objects were in the reported position. Case evaluated as Operation Firefly effects.
