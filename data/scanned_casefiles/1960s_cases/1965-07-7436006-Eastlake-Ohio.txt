1. Reference the attached letters from [redacted] requesting information on their observations of 13 and 19 July 1965.

2. The objects which they observed on the nights of 13 and 19 July 1965 are similar to observations of satellites. The inconsistencies in flight can be attributed to conditions in the atmosphere and illusion of the satellite's appearance or its movement or other lights in the sky.

3. The objects were not BMDO I or II, TELSTAR I or II. These are the only four satellites on which we have records. However, there are over thirty satellites visible to the unaided eye, and this are as bright or brighter than BMDO I. Identification of the satellites might possibly be obtained either the Smithsonian Institute or from NASA.

Dear Sir:

I would like to report a U.F.O.

From 11 P.M. until July 17 at 10:10 to 10:15 going out at the East Trumbull St. market was a fairly peculiar something. It looked so similar in a bright haze. Sometimes it moved from North to South or slightly to north in another pattern.

It would like to know if your home or anything at that time.

Thankyou

P.S. Will send a note like a letter with our other letter.
