PROJECT 16073 RECORD
1. DATE, TIME GROUP: 18 Oct, 1966 
2. LOCATION: Newburgh, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual
7. COURSE: N/A
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Aircraft (possible)

The brief summary and analysis states that the observer noted an object that was compared to a short silver star-like object in color. The reflection of the sun off the object was described as bright. The object flew across the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge across the Hudson River. The observer had poor eyesight and still had to wear glasses, and did not have opportunity for a sustained observation. The report concludes that the object was possibly an aircraft due to the very heavy air traffic in the area at the time, but nothing unusual was observed.

V.F.R. air traffic on down-wind, base, and final to runway 27 at Stewart AFB flyover and parallel the Beacon-Newburgh Bridge. TAGAN approach 3 and Enroute/TAGAN approach to Stewart also parallel the Bridge on final. In addition, numerous VFR traffic use the Bridge as a check point and the Hudson River as an airway. The 90th Troop Carrier Group (CONAC) at Stewart AFB is presently checking out in C-124 aircraft and were flying approaches to runway 27 on the date of Mrs. Smith's sighting.

Captain Stephen Levine, USAF, Rated Pilot/Navigator
(1) All available evidence indicates that Mrs. *** observed an aircraft.
(2) Mrs. *** is very sketchy on the date and time of her sighting and as a result, it is impossible to exactly match her observations with reported traffic.
(3) A C-124 on base to Runway 27 at 1000 hours would appear the same as the description Mrs. *** gave of the object she sighted. The C-124's relatively small wings compared to its fuselage would appear as a elongated silver object in the shape of a short cigar.
(4) I questioned toll takers who were on the Bridge at the time of the sighting. They stated there was very heavy air traffic but nothing unusual.
(5) Traffic on the Bridge and its location justified two large towns base me to believe that any UFO would have instigated hundreds of telephone calls than just Mrs. ***. Obviously what Mrs. *** saw was not considered unusual by hundreds of other pairs of eyes.
(6) Refer to G(2).

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloons releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting: N/A

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
1. Initial investigation has not disclosed the nature of this U.F.O.
  a. I am not familiar with any known object matching Mr. [redacted] description.
  b. The observer may be mistaken as to the altitude of this object. His comparison of size to a silver dollar held at arm's length and an altitude of three to five thousand feet would make the object exceptionally large. An error in altitude would also account for the object's apparent rapid rate of speed, i.e., it may have been much closer to the observer and appeared to be moving exceptionally fast.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs:
A map is attached showing flight path of U.F.O. and position of observers.
