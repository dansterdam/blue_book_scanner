11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer lives on top of hill and spotted object at 75 deg above the North, and after 21 minutes noticed object change course to 30 deg, altitude of 50,000 ft with estimated very high speed. Object was white, bright as Venus. After change of 30 deg course, heading SE to E, he noticed 2 close objects or orange lights traveling parallel. Tried to flight path parallel gaining altitude as an attempt to intercept object. All three objects passed directly overhead and traveled SW. The large object was appeared 2/3 the original size after 4 minutes of observation. This two smaller orange lights did not intercept the larger object. No sound.
