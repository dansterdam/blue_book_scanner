Gentlemen:

On Tuesday evening, March 22, 1966, my daughter and myself observed what I believe to be the same flying saucer lights which were widely reported in the Litchfield, Gardiner, and Richmond area. My house is located on the northern outskirts of Richmond village and we had a good opportunity to observe the lights which appeared to our left, crossed toward our right disappeared, and reappeared again on our left.

We also observed that each of these two lights had a very definite period much like the air beacons at Augusta and Auburn, also that each light had a very faint, thin tail which was anchored one almost due west of us, the other almost due North. The directions of Auburn and Augusta respectively.

Since the establishment of various beacons in this area (about thirty years), have often observed similar lights without realizing that they were ships from Mars.

Yours Truly,

[Signature area is blacked out]
