2. Radar Confirmation:
(1) The radar console operator is a highly trained, and reliable personnel. 
(2) The times of radar sightings correlate quite well with visual sightings.
(3) Radar sightings do not correlate well with visual sightings.
(4) False radar returns are not unusual. These returns were received on the morning of 11 July 1968.
(5) Though it is remotely possible that radar returns observed by vandenberg could be related to the visual and electrical sightings, the weight of evidence suggests this is probably not the case.

CASE OFFICER'S FINAL REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
On 7 July 1968, USAF personnel at Eielson AFB, Alaska, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was first observed at approximately 2356 hours local time and was tracked on radar for several minutes. The object was described as a bright light in the western sky, maneuvering in an erratic manner, and at times appeared to stop and hover. No audible sound was associated with the object.
2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
The sighting was reported by A1C Doyle H. Summerfield, 354th Security Police Squadron, Eielson AFB, Alaska. At approximately 2356 hours local time, A1C Summerfield, while on patrol, observed a bright light in the western sky. The object appeared to be maneuvering in an erratic manner, with rapid changes in direction and speed. At times, the object appeared to stop and hover. No sound was associated with the object. A1C Summerfield immediately notified the Command Post, which in turn alerted the Weapons Control Center.
The Weapons Control Center was able to track the object on radar for several minutes. The radar tracking confirmed the visual sighting, indicating that the object was approximately 15-20 miles southwest of the base, at an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
3. CONCLUSION:
After a thorough investigation, this incident remains unidentified. The object's erratic maneuvers and high speed were not characteristic of any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The radar confirmation of the visual sighting lends credibility to the report. The case is therefore classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

This report indicates that the 43rd ATS Squadron at Murphy Dome located 35 km west of Fairbanks, Alaska observed a visual sighting of an object in question. The object was described as a light that appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. It was concluded that the object was probably an astronomical body such as the moon, and no evidence of an unusual aerial vehicle was found.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from a Project Blue Book document, specifically from 1968-07-7200295-EIELSONAFB-ALASKA.pdf46.txt.

The text in the document is as follows:

The observations that were made during this incident can cast considerable doubt as to the existence of a structure of the type that was observed. At the time of the observations, there was apparently a belief that the object was a solid, metallic structure that was seen against a dark background. However, some of the physical effects that were observed, and the manner in which the object disappeared, tend to cast doubt on the solidness of the structure. For example, the fact that the object could apparently "fold into itself" and disappear, and the fact that it was observed to change color and intensity during the sighting, would indicate that it was not a solid, metallic structure as it first appeared. It is quite possible that what was observed was actually some type of atmospheric phenomenon or optical illusion, and was not a solid physical structure at all.

Investigations of the characteristics of this incident have raised some questions as to the validity of the observations. While sightings of this type do occur, and while they may represent something of considerable scientific interest, the physical effects observed in this case tend to cast doubt on the interpretation that a solid, metallic structure was seen. It is important that all aspects of such incidents be carefully evaluated before conclusions are drawn as to the nature of the observed phenomena.

Statement of Possible Correlation of Visually Observed Light Phenomenon observed at Eielson APB on 13 July 1968

Intelligence Officer ATSG(T)  
APO Seattle 98737

1. On 13 July 1968 at approximately 4:05 AM ADT, Eielson Tower Personnel called the RAPCON and asked if it could see something sighting south on their radar. The RAPCON operators observed a possible target which was moving southeasterly, described as about four to five degrees in size, having an irregular shaped illuminated center, and fluctuating in intensity. This target was tracked on radar from 4:05 to 4:14 AM ADT.

2. The radar target was initially observed at approximately two miles range from the radar site. The target's speed appeared to be about 25 knots. After processing, the radar returns indicated the target was moving slowly, approximately 30 knots. The target made a sudden turn and its speed increased to approximately 60 knots. The target was observed in this position for about thirty five minutes. Two radar targets were observed and both targets were slowly moving to the northeast.

3. Approximately ten minutes prior to the fading of the original radar target, a second target appeared. This second target seemed to pulse on and off erratically. The second target was tracked moving in a southwesterly direction toward the first target, and the two appeared to merge. The merged targets then continued southwesterly at a point about fifteen miles southwest of the landing light at the end of the radar antenna. The southwest bound target faded at a point about twenty miles from the site.

4. About 45 minutes had elapsed from the initial observation until the radar contact disappeared. During this period, the radar operators stated there were numerous targets to appear and disappear at various points of the scope. These unexplained targets were very difficult to track due to their erratic movement. At one point, one of the targets appeared to split into three separate targets that then recombined into one target.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:
RECORDING OF THE DATA IN REAL TIME
1. Radar detection target was acquired at 0058Z on 17 July 1968 at a range of approximately 12 nautical miles north of Eielson AFB, Alaska. The target appeared to be moving in a north bound direction.
2. Target was tracked for approximately 15 minutes until 0113Z. During this time the target maintained a constant speed of approximately 3000 knots and an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.
3. At 0113Z the target accelerated to an estimated speed in excess of 12,000 knots and climbed to an estimated altitude of over 100,000 feet. The target was lost from radar at this time.
4. There were no other radar contacts in the area during the time of the sighting.
5. No visual sightings were made of the target during the time it was being tracked on radar.
6. The radar equipment used to track the target was the FPS-93 height-finder radar at Eielson AFB, Alaska.

The image appears to contain a photograph. The photograph shows a radar track or trace, which is a line or shape that represents the movement or detection of an object on a radar system.

6. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL do not normally take note of every sighting of unidentified flying objects as such, unless a request is made for further investigation of a reported sighting. This is due to the fact that many reports appear to be natural phenomena or other objects which do not warrant further investigation at that time, or which have already been satisfactorily explained. Consequently, the maintenance of observation of unidentified aircraft or other objects which remain in a radar picture is usually not justified except when specifically requested from higher headquarters.

SITUATION:
1. On the morning of 11 July 1968, a report of an unidentified object (UFO) was reported to the 547th Strategic Wing Combat Intelligence Division, Ab Strategic Wing, Eielson AFB.
2. Sighting reports:
(1) At approximately 1200Z hours 11 July 1968, Eielson AFB radar controller reported that object observed at 6 km altitude south of Eielson AFB. (See Item 3.)
(2) Eielson Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) was contacted by tower personnel and reported radar returns south of Eielson AFB.
(3) The 744 AGC Squadron at Murphy Dome, located 15 km w. of Eielson AFB, tracked an object and alerted Eielson for further sightings.
(4) Tower personnel requested that the 5th Strategic Wing alerted their personnel on the airfield to observe the phenomenon. As the aircraft were returning, the Captain said that nothing could be seen as dusk was falling. He said with the use of binoculars, no unusual phenomena was observed. His report does not confirm it's existence.

INVESTIGATION:
2. All personnel involved in the sightings were interviewed.
(1) No radar contact was made. 
(2) The altitude of site equipment (600m to 900m) would aligned with reports of unusual aircraft only due to ground clutter. As high as this is it seems incredible to those engaged.
(3) No warnings of hazards to flights such as balloon or bird migrations had been received.
(4) No known unusual weather phenomenon occurred at this time.
4. Area facilities were contacted for pertinent information on any unusual results.
