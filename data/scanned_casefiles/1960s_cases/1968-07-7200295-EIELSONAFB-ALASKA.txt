11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
At 0930 local, several aircraft controllers sighted a large orange or yellow light in a clear area of sky south of the base; the light did not move much laterally (except slightly west) and gradually became dimmer until it disappeared to 035 into the haze that had moved into the area. The Fairbanks RAPCON was contacted, by the tower personnel, and reported radar returns south of Eielson AFB.

(1) Agencies Contacted:
    (a) Fairbanks Approach Control Center.
    (b) Fairbanks Flight Service.
    (c) Fort Wainwright Airfield Operations.
    (d) Eielson Air Force Base - Base Operations.
    (e) Fort Greely Flight Operations.

    (f) Fort Greely Range Officer - (Who also checked all appropriate organizations working in the Fort Greely area).

    (g) Fort Wainwright Range Officer - (Who also checked all appropriate organizations working in the Fort Wainwright area).

    (h) Alaskan Air Command - Command Post.

    (i) Alaskan NORAD Region Combat Center - (Who also checked applicable organizations within the NORAD Region).

    (j) Alaskan Air Command - Intelligence.

    (k) 13th Missile Warning Squadron - Clear HEWS.

    (l) Det 2, 11th Weather Squadron, Eielson AFB, and Fairbanks Weather Service. (See Atch # 4).

    (m) Alaska Land, a Fairbanks commercial organization which occasionally flies a manned balloon.

(2) Information Requested:
    (a) Known aircraft flights which could possibly place the aircraft in the area in question.

    (b) Knowledge of the launching of any vehicles which could, at any time, enter the area in question, i.e., rockets, balloons, flares, etc.

    (c) Knowledge of any organization which might launch, or have knowledge of the launching of any aircraft or vehicle which could enter the area in question.

3. CONCLUSION:
    a. The three primary personnel involved in the visual sighting are highly dependable individuals. Their job calls for careful screening, extensive training, and consistently high performance and reliability. Their work requires constant observation and identification of a great variety of aircraft.


- page 2 -

Here is the text from the document:

b. It is unlikely that the witnesses involved would be unable to identify an aircraft, balloon, weather occurrence, or other recognizable natural phenomena.

c. Radar Confirmation:

(1) The RAPCON console operator is a highly trained, experienced and reliable specialist.

(2) The times of radar sightings correlate quite well with visual sightings.

(3) Radar sightings do not correlate well with visual sightings in reference to movement, quantity of objects involved, and position of objects. (See Atch 5)

(4) False radar returns are not unusual. These returns, called "ghosts" by radar operators, sometimes act in much the same manner as the returns received on the morning of 11 July 1968.

(5) The console operator on duty on 11 July told the investigating officer that, had tower personnel not obtained him concerning returns received from the south, he would have attributed these returns to routine "ghost" tracks.

(6) Though it is perfectly possible that radar returns were caused by objects reported by witnesses, it is equally possible that there is no relationship between the visual and electrical sightings.

d. It is unlikely that the object observed was a vehicle launched or flown by any local civilian or government agency.

e. The sighting which occurred on the morning of 11 July 1968 is an "Unidentified Flying Object" as it has not been explained and appeared out of the ordinary. It is therefore reportable under the provisions of AFR 80-17.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
At 0800 local, several aircraft controllers sighted a large orange or yellow light in a clear area of sky south of the base. The light did not move much laterally (except slightly west) and gradually became dim until it disappeared to 0325 into the haze that had moved into the area. The RADRCON was contacted, by the tower personnel, and reported-radar returns south of Eielson AFB.

FTD FORM
FTD MLF-63 0-329 (TDE) Previous editions of this form may be used.

The 744th AC&W Squadron at Murphy Dome located 35 km west of Eielson AFB was requested to report any visual or radar sightings in area in question. No sightings were noted. There were no known aircraft or balloons that could have been in the area. The only visual sighting was by tower personnel but radar sightings do not correlate well with visuals in reference to movement.

A statement by the RADRCON console operator that he thought the points were radar "ghosts" in instances that were under investigation were ruled out due to anomalous propagation.

At 0300 local the moon was at azimuth of 194 deg and elevation of 5 to 6 deg and was a full moon (full moon 10 Jul 68). At about 0325 local it was at approximately 201 deg AG and at about 4 to 5 deg elevation. This combined with the statement that the object was seen in a bright patch of sky and that the sky gradually haze over in the south would indicate that the observers were looking at the moon.

The disorientation that pilots experience during night formation flight may result from the so-called the autokinetic illusion. An autokinetic illusion is a visual phenomenon in which a stationary spot of light appears in motion randomly appearing to move continuously. As now known, pilots have been experienced by pilots when they were observing formation lights on other aircraft (6). In such a case, a trained pilot to the extent that he will spin in a link trainer (6). He may spin slightly from formation flight so that he will "saw" the other two aircraft in the formation pull-off to the left when, actually, they had not changed course (16). On the other hand, pilots two with a resultant loss of one pilot and share two-sided errors.

Investigations of the autokinetic illusion reveal that the experiment made in great and most focus when small call (point-source) (6) lights are being viewed but it is still present in the case of large light sources (6, 7) and, changing to a lesser degree, when viewing pattern of lights (8). Therefore, the use of less or larger area reference lights in formation flight causes an autokinetic effect which has been demonstrated that autokinetic movement was frequent and large when both only one reference light was visible during formation flight, was much reduced when two reference lights were visible, and reduced over more two reference lights were visible (6).

personnel that they had sighted as report or object. We arrived at a new site approximately 20 miles Southeast of the base. I proceeded to the rear arriving at approximately 0340, by which time the object had proceeded to a Control direction and could no longer be seen by the naked eye. However, through Control reported that they had been observing slow moving returns in the vicinity and direction this observation had been made. A search control was initiated and hearing of one party, and reported that it was to the South at a distance that I cannot recall. I looked in that direction through the binoculars and observed what appeared to be a very dim object reflecting light that was almost obscured by clouds and haze. It appeared to be either almost stationary or flying almost due 204-205°. It was above the horizon. The clouds were quite dark, and low in the green and the object or phenomenon faded out of sight within approximately 5 minutes. I could not determine or estimate its size, distance, or altitude, and I believe it could have been a helicopter, some manned aircraft, or some other earthly object, however I have no idea what the source a manned aircraft might have had in that area at that time of day. I was a plotting officer at the 4602d Defense Radar Site. The defense Radar Site was contracted during the incident and he reported that they had no returns on their radar in this vicinity. No further action was taken.

The above statement is true and correct to the best of my recollection.

Donald A. Sproll ATCS(T) Eielson RAPCON                   14 July 1968

SUBJECT: Statement of Possible Correlation of Visually Observed Light Emitting Object or Phenomena With a Radar Observed Target

TO: Intelligence Officer
Eielson AFB, Alaska
APO Seattle 98737

1. On the morning of July 11, 1968 at approximately 4:05 AM AIT Eielson Tower Personnel called the RAPCON and asked if I could "See" something about 20 miles to the south on our radar. I informed them that I did observe a radar target at 18 miles, Bearing about 140 degrees magnetic (29 Degrees variation) from true north on radar antenna. I was asked to "Keep an Eye" on this target and this I did do.

2. The radar Target was initially observed at approximately two miles south of the Harding Lake Towers, a south westward heading. At the outset the speed appeared to be about 90 knots. After proceeding on this heading for ten miles, the target abruptly (no turning AO noted) headed to the east and after reaching a point about five miles south of the originally observed position it again headed southwest. The target made one more zig-zag in it's southwest track and slowed to about thirty knots. This target faded from the radar ten miles east of the Cold King Airport after being observed from about thirty to forty minutes.

3. Approximately ten minutes prior to the fading of the original track, there appeared two additional targets at the origin of the first. These started out along the original track but then split into two separate targets at a point about fifteen miles southwest of the Harding Lake Towers; One, following generally the track of the first observed target. The other target tracked due west and faded about thirty miles south (180° Mag from the radar antenna). The southwest bound target faded at a point about five miles north of the last observed target paint on the original track.

4. About 45 minutes had elapsed from the initial observation until the last.

5. Under certain Atmospheric conditions, especially in the early morning or evening, it is not uncommon for numerous targets to appear on the radar with no apparent explanation. These unexplained targets are commonly referred to as "Ghosts". Most of these fade after a very short period (several scans of the radar antenna). However a few do paint for a period of many minutes.

6. We in Air Traffic Control do not normally take notes of every ghost target that appears on the radar. Only those targets that we identify as Aircraft or those that have unusual VFR radar flight following are observed closely. Occasionally an unidentified target is given special attention. It is apparent that in the way some a Radar in the control of an identified aircraft. All unidentified targets are given as traffic to a pilot of radar traffic. Otherwise we have no real maintain observation of unidentified aircraft or other objects which would result in a radar target.

The image shows a circular diagram with a central point and a line extending from the center, set against a white background.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white diagram or illustration of a circular object with a border of small protrusions or markings around its edge. A thin line extends from the center of the circle. The image looks like it could be a technical drawing or schematic of some kind.

I cannot discern any legible text in this image. The document appears to be a black and white photograph of a circular diagram or chart with markings around its perimeter, set within a square frame. There is a faint line extending from the center of the circle. The image quality is somewhat grainy and low contrast.

There is no legible text on this page. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a circular object or diagram with a central point, surrounded by a textured or serrated edge, set within a square frame.

The text in the image is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. There appears to be a circular diagram or instrument with degree markings around its circumference, but the specific text on these markings cannot be clearly read.

The text I can discern on this page is:

19-45
102-30

There is also a faint marking in the top right corner that appears to say "ROUTING" but it is quite illegible.

INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IAW AFR 80-17

1. SITUATION:
   a. On the morning of 11 July 1968, a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) was forwarded to the 5004th Command Post by Sgt Rose of the 6th Strategic Wing Combat Intelligence Division.

   b. Sequence of Events:
      (1) At approximately 1200Z hours 11 July 1968, Eielson AFB tower personnel observed an orange round object at a low altitude about 13 miles south of Eielson AFB. (See Atch # 1).

      (2) Fairbanks Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) was contacted by tower personnel and reported radar returns south of Eielson AFB. (See Atch # 2).

      (3) The 744 ACW Squadron at Murphy Dome, located 35 Ki west of Eielson AFB, was requested to report any visual or radar sightings in the area in question. No sightings were made.

      (4) Tower personnel requested that the 6th Strategic Wing super-visor of Flying, Major Cannon, who was on the aircraft parking ramp at the time, come to the tower to observe the phenomenon. At the time of his arrival the object was no longer readily visible, however, a sighting was made with the use of binoculars. Although Major Cannon could not positively identify the object as unusual, his report does confirm its existence.

2. INVESTIGATION:
   a. All personnel involved in the sighting were interviewed. (See Atch # 1).

   b. The 744 ACW Squadron was contacted, and Captain Wiess, the controller on duty at the time of the sighting, was interviewed. The following pertinent information was obtained:
      (1) No radar contact was made.

      (2) The altitude of site equipment (3000 ft ASL) would have made radar contact extremely unlikely due to ground clutter, as the object was sighted at low altitude and was slow moving.

      (3) No warnings of hazards to flights such as balloon launchings had been received by the site in the recent past.

   c. No known unusual weather phenomenon occurred at this time. (See Atch # 4).

   d. Area facilities were contacted for pertinent information, with negative results.
