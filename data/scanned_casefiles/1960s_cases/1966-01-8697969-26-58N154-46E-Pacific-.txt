Light was white and appeared to be stationary. Watched it for approx. 3-5 minutes. Did not have binoculars or telescope. Could not determine shape or size. Did not have camera. Appeared to be a bright light with no blinking or flashing. Seemed to be stationary. Told a friend who also saw the light.

STATEMENT OF GLYNN J. PERKINS, MASTER :

"Just prior to 2200 ship time, January 11, 1966, I was in my bunk when I heard a bump-to-bump turn of fact on the bridge getting over by head. Abby, the phone rang and Mr. Anderson, Third Mate, reported that appeared to be a plane aftre on the port quarter.

I ran to the bridge, but could see nothing. The information given me indicated a plane in trouble had headed for the ship and drifted on the port quarter.

At 2201, the vessel started to execute a Williamson Turn. The bow lookout was doubled and a search was made utilizing the vessel search light.

During the search, I realized that I had heard no sound, such as a plane would have made. I questioned Glennch, A.B. on bow lookout and learned that the object had maneuvered approximately 180° about the vessel wide-out course.

At 2258, vessel executed another Williamson Turn and resumed her original course and continued search.

At 2300, I took statements from each of the witnesses, Mr. Anderson, Cabin Mate on watch, R.A. Glennch, A.B. and Mr. Loughran, of Third Mate's watch last night. Each told the same story about the object. The statements were taken individually and I did not seek to make them agree.

The weather was clear; wind SSW 25, Barometer 30.16, Temperature 19 dry 15 Centigrade, sea moderate, and fine with excellent visibility, almost full moon stern with the vessel steering 267 gyro and 252 true.

This is a fine appearing vessel, a fact important in considering the possibility of poor steering and yawing will not such factors have contributed to the object seen from the add to the port quarter.

There were two (2) phone calls from the two First when object was on added quarters. The Third Mate ran to still using and looked forward, noting nothing. Another phone call from the bow watch (on bow lookout) came to the point quarters. The Third Mate and Mate looked and saw the object.

While afore a rather prolonged time element during which the object was visible."
