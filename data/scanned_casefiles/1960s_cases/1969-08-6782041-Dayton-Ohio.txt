14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
MY WIFE, DAUGHTER, SON-IN-LAW & I WERE SITTING IN CAR AND TOLD AS WE NORMALLY
DO TO COOL OFF & GET AWAY FROM THE TRAFFIC NOISE IN THE COUNTRY. MY SON-IN-LAW
WAS WATCHING PICTURES OF BIRDS SINGING IN THE SKY WHEN HE SAW WHAT HIS
FIRST WIFE WAS ON AIRPLANE AT FIRST ALTITUDE. AS THE OBJECT CAME MORE HE
WAS PUZZLED. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH ALTITUDE AND WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WITH
NAKED EYE (WE USED GLASSES) SO I GOT MY BINOCULARS WHICH SHOWED
THE PHENOMENON AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 12, PAGE 4.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
IT SLOWLY DISAPPEARED AS DARKNESS CAME ON 2 O'CLOCK
NOT THE SAME WITH THE BINOCULARS.
