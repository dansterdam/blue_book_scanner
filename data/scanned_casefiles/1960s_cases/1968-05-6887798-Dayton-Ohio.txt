PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 1 May 68 (est)
2. LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 to 10 seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Civilian
7. COURSE: N to S
8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [X] No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [X] No
10. CONCLUSION: Possible (METEOR)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an object that was a bright red color in front (like burning embers or coal) and was bright behind. The object went from the north to the south "like it was arking into the ground." It was seen for 5 to 10 seconds and made no noise.

COMMENTS: The duration, and flight path of the object are consistent with a meteor observation. However the observer shows a fins on the object in his drawing. Since no one else in the Dayton Area reported seeing a UFO and because the characteristics are so similar to those of a meteor observation, the sighting is listed as a possible meteor.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
