2100 hours. UFO sighting - large crowd to see friend. We will take action we can.

2115 hours. Talked with United Press, Sidney, Ohio. Phone 156.

2245 hours. Talked with Col. Barr of the Martin-Marietta reporting interest, altitude of 170 to 200 ft. N.J.

2250 hours. Initiated action to notify AF Intelligence, Dayton.

2310 hours. Called CO at Mitchel. Passed the few questions (CG) for release. No further action.

2315 hours. At Wright-Patterson. Told Public Information, LWA 475-100-4. To W. Martin-Telema in a series query of the situation.

2320 hours, at Sidney. On at Winans' ranch and police department. We were told the press could give the AF altitude calculation. No action.

2325 hours, at Sidney. Continued investigative activity. Reported to Dayton.

2330 hours. At Winans' ranch. Continuing investigation. No further reports.

0300 hours, at Bradley, phone to clear report. Strong thermal activities in area of sightings or size of sightings. At Hackensack, a lady reported 3 objects in sky about 5 minutes. Continued rapidly in a westerly direction. This was about 2 hours after the initial sighting. Talked at this point on silver bridge construction witnessed by and said lights, larger in size, were quite clear.

Direct line with the Mitchel. That would have been aircraft landing lights and/or camera, possible and apparent lights. The Mitchel aircraft was not available.
