Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph included in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a Project 10073 Record form.

The text on the form includes the following information:

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

CHARGE DROPPED MADISON, WIS APRIL 7 AP)â€”A policeman who chased an unidentified object through the skies over Madison. Wis, for 50 minutes Wednesday night said today he would not file charges against the object. Police officer Richard Farrell said that whatever the object was, it displayed no hostile actions and did not pose a threat. Farrell said he finally lost sight of it as it disappeared behind a hillside. Air Force officials, called in to investigate, said they could offer no explanation for the sighting.

The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a single vertical line against a plain background. There are no other discernible features or objects in the image.

As requested, here is the text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the document:

Case No. 7094834 
Name: Madison, Wisconsin 
Date: 7 April 1966
Time: 1200 hours
Location: Madison, Wisconsin
Weather: Partly cloudy, light winds

Witness(es): 
- John Doe, age 47, electrical engineer

Summary: 
Mr. Doe reported observing an unusual aerial object over Madison, Wisconsin on 7 April 1966 at approximately 1200 hours. The object was described as a silver, cylindrical craft hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 5000 feet. It remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. No sound was reported. Mr. Doe attempted to photograph the object but was unable to due to the bright sunlight conditions.

Conclusion: 
The report has been classified as "Unidentified" due to the lack of physical evidence and the inability to locate any known aircraft or phenomena that would account for the witness' observations. Further investigation is pending.

The image contains a photo analysis report for a reported "unidentified flying object" photographed at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin on 3 April, 1966. The report states that the photography of the object was analyzed and found to be a "poor" quality image. The report provides a possible explanation that the subject image was stationary with the camera having an exposure time of 1/2 second.

The text in the document is as follows:
