Here is the text I can read from the document:

Beloit, Wisconsin 1961

These are the photographs
regarded of the UFO reported upon
with data follow

The case shapes are roughly
due to some poor (faint?) lens
(rest of text is partially illegible)

The date at the top right appears to be 5/3/66

The image appears to be a scanned document page with a low-quality, grainy black and white photograph. The photograph is very dark and appears to have some sort of white or light-colored object or marking in the center, but the details are extremely difficult to discern due to the poor image quality. The page has vertical text along the left and right margins, but the text is not clearly legible in this image.


- page 4 -

There is very little text visible on this page. The only discernible text is a small "8" near the bottom right of the page. The rest of the page appears to be a blank white or light gray document page with some faint vertical and horizontal lines.

Much of the text on this page is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. There are some partially visible words and lines of text, but they cannot be confidently transcribed.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-47
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 17 November 1966

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin    DATE 3 April 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF ________________   IR ________________   QUALITY Poor
P NRS Attached

1. Photography of a reported "unidentified flying object" was analyzed and found to consist of a tiny reddish image of unknown origin. The photography (two 35 mm color slides) was measured and the curved, "boomerang" shaped images were found to be 0.109 mm and 0.222 mm high from end to end with a length from the ends to the curved portion of 0.260 mm and an arc 0.178 mm from respectively.

2. A possible explanation is that subject image was stationary with camera movement causing the curved shape of the resultant imagery. This image was taken of an electric light used in a fruitless attempt at some night photography of insufficiently illuminated subject.
