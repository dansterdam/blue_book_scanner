11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    Observ noticed a bright star-type object in the sky. It would move eastward during a short time. The object was changing color, from red to green to blue to white. Object remained stationary over a town about forty miles an hour. The witnesses said that the UFO was color white.

    The description is consistent with a star or meteor. Observation was very vague, was not of much value. Capella by position and apparent motion seems to be the most reasonable explanation for the observation.
