I saw a very bright light something that resembled a very large flores' light bulb, but much larger & brighter.  
I heard a sizzling sound & saw this great lighted thing coming down on on our single & saw It shoot from up in the sky just as coming down from Kane ra to Sharpsville Pa. directly over our field about 150 to 300 ft. high.  
It was about 5 to 8 ft. long & about 5 to 8" round from where I was stand & very bright glow of blue white & like it was burning orange bottom but 50 was much brighter than any other bright lights.  
While man about 40 yrs of age myself ran down into the field then stand ped when it landed & retreated because we tho. .ght it might explode & we may get hurt.  
The next day we & some women friends walked over this land but we cound find nothing was all tired as ourselves or perhaps a little farmer on into our next field. At the angle it was traveling Co. farm & it was traveling due south towards Pgh. Pa. I saw your article.
