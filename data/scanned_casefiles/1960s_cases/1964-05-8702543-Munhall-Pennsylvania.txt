Dear Sir:

I want to tell you about what I saw last may while plowing our land for
A garden.

I saw A very bright light something that resembled a very large florescent
light bulb, but much larger & brighter.

I heard A sizzling sound & saw this great lighted thing coming down on
angle from the sky at about 7Pm Day light. It came down from the north
east such as coming from Kane Pa to Sheakleyville Pa. directly over our
farm house & over our maple tree I would say 50 ft in the sky & landed
our field below the old chicken coop.

It was about 6 to 8 ft long & about 6to 8" round from where I was standing
& very bright glow of blue white & like it was burning orange color on
bottom but it was much brighter than any shooting star I ever seen or
other bright light.

A young man about 17yrs of age & myself ran down into the field then set
ped when it landed & it retreated because we thought it might explode & we
may get hurt.

The next day we & some women friends walked over this land but we could
find anything. we either missed it or it burried itself or perhaps it
A little farther into our next field at the angle it was traveling
very fast. Snool Road. Deer creek township Mercer Co.

Farm & it was traveling due south towards Pgh Pa. I saw your article.
