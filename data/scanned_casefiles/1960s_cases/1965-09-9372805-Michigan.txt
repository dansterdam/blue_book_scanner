Gentlemen:

On 1 September 1965, I noticed something you may wish to investigate. At 10:20 p.m. central daylight time, my family and I were outdoors on our patio watching for a few seconds, it was obvious there was no sound. The lights were very bright with an apparent wind. This was also witnessed by my friends and parents.

When the lights started there were two traveling in a northeasterly direction. While the lights were still visible, they reversed direction and traveled in a southwesterly direction. The lights were still clearly visible. They reversed direction a second time and traveled northeasterly again. This was approximately five (5) minutes in duration.

As we waited, another light appeared to be traveling in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be traveling at a great speed. I reported this sighting to the local authorities, who seemed very interested. However, they said there was nothing they could do.

The entire object also began traveling in a northwesterly direction. This appeared to be traveling at a great speed. I reported this sighting to the local authorities, who seemed very interested. However, they said there was nothing they could do.

A few seconds after the lights reversed direction, I ran in the house to get my camera. Regretfully, I only two frames of film were left on the film. When I returned, the lights had disappeared. However, if you feel this film could be of interest, it will be available to you undeveloped.

Should you wish to contact me, my home phone number is Area code  My address is  Michigan 48 . 

Sincerely,
