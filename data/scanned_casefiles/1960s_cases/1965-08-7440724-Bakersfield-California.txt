TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

SEP 29 1965

Dear Mr. ---------,

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

Your first observation is very similar to an observation of an infra-red photo solution. The colors, slow speed, and noise are all characteristic of this type of observation. The solution is caused by a generator which is used to generate the gas which is used to operate the seeker on certain types of missiles.

Your observation on 1 September 1965 can be attributed to a test aircraft flying at a high altitude.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF

Gentlemen:

I have a very serious incident about one which I felt I should report to your organization.

On the evening of September 1st, 1955, my wife and I were outside enjoying the cool evening air and watching the sky for shooting stars. Shortly after 9:30 pm, we saw a very bright light moving across the sky from the east to the west. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but shortly thereafter, the light grew dimmer and continued on its course. Shortly after that, we saw another bright light moving in the same direction as the first one. This light, however, appeared to be brighter and larger than the first one. It seemed to pulsate or grow dimmer and brighter as it moved across the sky. After a short while, this second light also grew dimmer and continued on its course.

The sky was very clear, with only a few scattered clouds here and there. There was no moon, but the stars were sparkling clear, although appearing to be rather small in the sky. The planet Venus was showing very brightly in the southwest as usual.

Reference the attached letter from___________________ requesting information concerning the USAF Air Force unidentified observations. The observation of August 1965 is very similar to an observation of an unidentified object or the HILSA, 9104 second observation. The altitude and the noise are all characteristic of this type of observation. The observation could be caused by supersonic operating equipment. The observation would be caused by the aircraft at high altitude as Mr Haberman stated.
