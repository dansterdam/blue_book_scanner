1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 28 Dec 67   2. LOCATION: Richardson, Texas

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1 assumed

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 12-15 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

7. COURSE: South - West

8. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes   ☒ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes   ☒ No

10. CONCLUSION: Probables Not a BALLOON

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer sighted a reddish orange to a whitish orange flickering object that was about the size of a Baseball at arm's length. The object traveled in some what a erratic flight path. "When the object reached an elevation of approximately 85 degrees two very tiny orange objects split off and flew away..." "The large object remained stationary for a few seconds and then its light flickered out, as if a match had been snuffed out or blown out."

COMMENTS: It was very likely that the object was a not Air garnet bag balloon and that the tiny orange objects that split off were parts of the burning stage.

January 3, 1968.

Gentlemen:

At 9:00 PM central standard time on December 29, 1967 I was left at residence at _____ Texas to walk to my residence _____ house are approximately four hundred feet apart.

As he walked almost due south he saw directly ahead a bright orange object which he estimated to be approximately the size of a ball at arm's length. The object was just above the horizon over the City of Dallas. It appeared to be moving toward him and climbing slowly. He thought he was watching a jet departing from Love Field and was describing it as being very casual.

Suddenly, as Jr. _____ approached my house, the object shot from just above the horizon due south and stopped in the southwest. This maneuver required only two or three seconds.

Mr. _____ knocked at my door and pointed out the object. It then appeared to be a large and bright orange pulsating star. It was obvious to us that we were watching some unusual object. He decided to return to his house to point out the object to his wife. I called to my son to fetch our 8x50 binoculars.

With the binoculars the object appeared to be a very large pulsating star with the color constantly changing from a deep reddish orange to whitish orange. The object now started moving very slowly and by three or four minutes it moved to a position due west of us, still at elevation of 45 degrees. It seemed to remain stationary in the west for perhaps one minute and then it started moving very slowly to the north.

When the object reached an elevation of approximately 35 degrees the bright orange object split off and flew away in tangent to the south at tremendous speed. The large object remained stationary for a few seconds and then its light flickered out.

We saw no further trace of either the large object or the smaller objects.

My wife hurried home to compare notes and her description matched mine completely with one exception. She saw the large object just before it flickered out. With the binoculars I was able to see instead the two tiny objects break away.

Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, page 2.

The sky was perfectly clear and the stars produced an excellent reference background for our sighting. Temperature was approximately 35 deg.F.

The only other airplane activity in the area was a jet a little to the northeast of us as a contrasted altitude of 500 feet, probably on approach to Love Field. This jet came into view approximately one minute before the large object flickered out.

The total time of the sighting was estimated to be ten to twelve minutes.

Altogether there were six witnesses, Mr. [redacted] and his wife, my wife, two children and myself. Mr. [redacted] is district manager for a clothing manufacturer and I am employed selling electronic components and assemblies. I hold a commercial flying license.

I feel the object was operating during most of the sighting at an altitude somewhere over 50,000 feet, but this can be no more than an educated guess. In my opinion it was not any conventional aircraft.

We will be pleased to answer any further questions you may have.

Yours very truly,
