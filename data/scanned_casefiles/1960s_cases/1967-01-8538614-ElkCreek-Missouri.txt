Transcribing the text from the document:

Apparently this object descended to an elevation of 100 feet or lower and hovered there for several minutes. The object was described as a large elliptical or saucer-shaped object, metallic in appearance and giving off an orange colored glow. It was estimated to be about 50-75 feet in diameter. Several witnesses observed the object and their sighting was confirmed by the deputy sheriff and others.
