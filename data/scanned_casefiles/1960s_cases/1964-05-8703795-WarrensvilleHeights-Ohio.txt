Echo I 808 PM EST S.OF CTY 12 REV -> NE

Dear Sir:

On the night of May 10, 1964, at 9:15 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time, we were outdoors, staggering at a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, when we saw an object in the southeastern sky slowly moving to the north across the eastern sky. It was with gradually turned light green. The weather was dry, the sky was clear, and the temperature was about sixty-five degrees.

Charles, who first sighted the object, observed it through a 36X telescope. Under telescopic observation, it appeared as a rectangle, we later agreed that this was due to improper focusing of the telescope. The object appeared as a star to the naked eye. When it was first sighted, the UFO was at approximately 120 degrees from true North, and 30 degrees in elevation. When it disappeared, it was at 30 degrees from true North, and 35 degrees in elevation.

We timed its transit across the sky, it took four minutes, fifty-seven seconds. Because we had no accurate way of determining its size or distance, we could not even guess at its speed. It was as bright as a second magnitude star (our two comparison stars were Delta Cassiopeia and Beta Ursa Majoris).

In accordance Form PTD 164 July 61, we have tried to answer all the questions. The personal information section follows.

Although neither of us have had any special training which would make us qualified observers, I (blacked out) have been an amateur astronomer for six years. We would appreciate you letting us know if this was a weather balloon or some natural object. Thank you for your time,

Yours Truly,
