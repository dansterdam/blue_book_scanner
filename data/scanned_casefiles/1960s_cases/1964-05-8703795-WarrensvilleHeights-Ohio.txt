Dear Sirs:

On the night of May 10, 1964, at 9:15 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time, we were outdoors, stargaxing in Warrensville Heights, Ohio. Suddenly, an object of Glow vanished. When we saw an object in the sky, moving to the north across the eastern sky. It was white and gradually faded to the east. The night was clear, and the sky was clear, and the object was clearly visible.

Charles...., who first sighted the object, observed it through telescopes. Under telescopic observation, it appeared as a rectangular object with four smaller objects in close proximity. It appeared as if star to the naked eye. When it was first sighted, it remained motionless for about 10 seconds in the north-northeast direction at an elevation of approximately 30 degrees. 

We timed its transit across the sky, it took four minutes, 32 seconds. Because we had no accurate way of determining its size, we could not even guess at its speed. It was as bright as a 1st or 2nd magnitude star (our two comparison stars were Delta Cassiopeiae and Beta Ursa Majoris).

In accordance Form UFD 164, July 61, we have tried to answer your questions. The personal Information section follows.

Although neither of us have had any special training which would qualify us as observers, I have been an amateur skywatcher for about six years. We would appreciate you letting us know if this was a known or some natural object. Thank you for your time.

Yours Truly,
