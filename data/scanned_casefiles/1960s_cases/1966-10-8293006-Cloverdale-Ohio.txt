27 OCT 65 CLOVERDALE, O.

February 18, 1966

Mrs [redacted]/safolcc/72542/18 Feb 66

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your aerial observation on the night of October 27, 1965, was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the process of setting at the time of your sighting. Venus had a right ascension of 17 hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -3.9. This placed the planet at or near the horizon at 240 degrees.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects. You will note from this report that no physical evidence is known to exist which would indicate that UFOs are interplanetary vehicles.

The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM and Saturday and Sunday from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Gentlemen:

I wish to report the sighting of a flying object which my Dad and I made on the night of Oct. 27th at 9:10 P.M. The object was in the west at about 15 degrees from the horizon. It was a little larger than Venus as it would appear to the naked eye, and was orange in color. The object appeared to move north a small distance then it stopped, it appeared to twinkle a little and then just disappeared from view. It did not go up or down sideways.

Please advise date & time your museum is open to the public. Is it true that you have unidentified flying objects? If so are these objects available for viewing? I am inclosing a self addressed stamped envelope. Thank you.

1. Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object from [redacted]. His observation on the night of 27 October 1965 was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the process of setting. Venus had a right ascension of 17 hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -3.9. This placed the planet at or near the horizon at 240 degrees azimuth.

2. The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9 A. M. to 4 P. M. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 P. M. to 5 P. M.

3. The attached brochure will help explain the objectives and results of Project Blue Book to date. No physical evidence is known to exist which supports the contention that unidentified flying objects exist as interplanetary vehicles.
