mo. we saw a flying object standing in the sky. 
it was the object was strange to me. i mentioned to 
my wife. it was almost out of sight. i hastily 
looked at it and it disappeared. i instantly
ran to the telephone to call the sheriff, but
i hesitated because i would think i am crazy. we
watched it for a few minutes and started
saying "look." when we first saw it, it was
about the size of a basketball. the exact size
i'm not sure. as i said, it was in a row, we
realized the situation was more serious than
we thought. the object was fair more distance
than i saw it, it no longer had the brightness
house and a more stop the same. i went inside the
attic where the i formed from the telephone directory
the triplanny relic, we couldn't
outside and sighted. it the next time i
sergeant gave us the telephone and made a report
then went back outside and started w... once
again. i made my report of approximately
1:15 p.m. just within minutes of the first sighting.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Back outline report on the case. The two times sightings were reported by the busi-nessmen in the air - the object was descri-bed as a round ball of light that would appear suddenly, hover for a few seconds and then disappear quickly. The object was quite large, estimated to be about 75-80 feet in diameter. The object did not appear to have any wings or other visible means of propulsion. On the second sighting, the object was observed for about 3-5 min. and this time it was said to have a slight orange color to it.

I want the investigator to note that several witnesses reported that the object had absolutely no sound,it was completely silent.

Approximately 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. at least one half dozen sightings were reported over the specific area. Many of the reports described the object as being the same as the previous descriptions.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
"PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION
OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A *R* AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW AN ARROW SHOWING THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON.
