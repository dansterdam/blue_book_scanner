27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

MY FRIEND AND MYSELF WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AT [REDACTED]. THE WOMAN UPSTAIRS WAS LEANING OUT HER WINDOW AND I WAS STANDING TO HER WHEN I SAW THE OBJECT IN THE SKY. AS MENTIONED BEFORE, IT WAS ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT BE-HIND THE BUILDING WHEN IT DISAPPEARED. I INSTANTLY LOOKED AT [REDACTED] AND ASKED HIM IF HE SAW IT AND HE SAID, "YES, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANY-THING BECAUSE YOU WOULD THINK I AM CRAZY." WE JOKED ABOUT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND STARTED WATCHING THE SKY HOPEFULLY WANTING TO SEE A "FLYING SAUCER." WHEN WE STARTED SEEING IT AGAIN AT ALMOST THE EXACT SAME POSITION AND DIRECTION FOR THE THIRD MORE SERIOUS THAN WE THOUGHT. INCIDENTALLY, AFTER THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT, IT NO LONGER HAD THE ROUNDISH SHAPE BUT A MORE STROB LIKE SHAPE. I WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT INFORMATION FROM THE TELEPHONE OPERATOR WHERE THE REPORT COULD BE MADE. WHILE I WAS OUTSIDE AND SIGHTED IT TWO MORE TIMES, I TALKED TO SERGEANT GRIPPI ON THE TELEPHONE AND MADE MY REPORT THEN WENT BACK OUTSIDE AND STARTED WATCHING FOR THE OBJECT AGAIN. I MADE MY REPORT AT APPROXIMATELY 1:15 P.M. JUST WITHIN MINUTES OF THE FIRST 3 SIGHTINGS.

Here is the text from the document:

HOW TO INDICATE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

APPROXIMATELY 35 TIMES SIGHTED, OUT OF MORE THAN ONE OBJECT AT EACH SIGHTING.

STREET LIGHTS.

THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT, IT APPEARED ROUND WITH A FLAT BOTTOM, I THOUGHT (I AM NOT POSITIVE) THAT IT HAD A RED STRIPE DOWN THE SIDE. EVERY TIME I SAW IT AFTER THAT IT WAS LIKE THE ERASER OF A PENCIL (SHAPE). VERY SOLID, LIGHTED, HAD NO PROTRUDING OBJECTS (ANTENNA, ETC.)

The document is a UFO sighting report form with various sections checked or filled out, including:
- Sky: Clear

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
IT HAD APPEARED MANY TIMES DURING THE TIME SPECIFIED. IT DID NOT JUST FINALLY DISAPPEAR.
