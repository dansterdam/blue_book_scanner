OVERHEAD (Near sun)        UNKNOWN

E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREET LIGHTS. ALSO DESCRIBE ANY UNUSUAL LIGHTING, SUCH AS PULSATING OR CHANGING COLORS.
The object seemed to give off its own illumination, with a white or yellowish light that remained fairly steady. No unusual lighting effects were noticed.

12. GIVE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT
PULSATES, FLASHED, OR WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER THE
OBJECT APPEARED TO BE HIGH IN THE SKY, OR LOW OR ON THE HORIZON. GIVE ANY OTHER DETAILS, SUCH AS SHAPE, SIZE IN
RELATION TO A FAMILIAR OBJECT, NUMBER, FORMATIONS, ETC.
The object appeared to be fairly high in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was about the size of a penny held at arm's length. Its shape was roughly circular or ovoid, with a bright steady glow that was white or yellowish in color. There was no pulsating or flashing, and no other colors were observed. The object appeared self-luminous and did not seem to reflect light from any other source. It maintained a steady speed and heading for several minutes before gradually fading from view.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME? 
SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SIZE AND/OR SHAPE?
FLASH OR DISAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

It appeared, it seemed to come here with great speed, it seemed to be about a mile away from me, and it seemed stationary for about two minuets, then it just disappeared.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It simply faded methodically from sight, rather than an abrupt disappearance.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

It was floating and hovering in the central southwest direction, not in front of or behind anything that I could see. It did not make any noise that I could hear, and did not have any tail or trail behind it that I could see. It had no flashing lights or colored lights, but was just a bright, white, luminous glow, and was quite a ways off. When it finally disappeared, it didn't seem to gradually go out, but rather just faded out of sight.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank form or template with instructions for drawing a picture that shows the shape of a phenomenon, including any details such as wings, protrusions, or exhaust/vapor trails, and indicating the direction of the phenomenon using an arrow.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE (HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON). NEXT MOVE THE OBJECT UNTIL IT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. HOW MANY TIMES WIDER OR LONGER THAN THE MATCH HEAD WAS THE OBJECT? THIS WILL GIVE YOU A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON.
