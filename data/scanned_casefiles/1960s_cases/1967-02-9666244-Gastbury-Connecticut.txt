To whom this may concern.

Dear Sir,

On February 17, 1967 while skating with my cousin I spotted a unidentified flying object. As I looked up I saw a gigantic thing. It was round and white and stood in one place suddenly around 1822 PM. We went to the window and it disappeared.

I would appreciate it if I could have some information and pictures on them.

Thank You
Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
