The image contains two radar scope displays. The displays show circular patterns with concentric rings and various markings, suggesting these are radar or sonar images. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in the image.

4. The aircraft was visually observed in flight, orbiting the area of the radar contacts.
5. The flight controls were observed to be functioning properly, and the radar contact was not considered to be caused by a malfunction of the aircraft's equipment.
6. The visual observations made of the aircraft and its position correlated with the radar contacts.
7. The radar contacts were observed to be at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet above the surface.
8. The aircraft was under the control of the flight crew at all times and at no time was the aircraft out of the sight of the observers.
9. The size of the radar contacts was estimated to be approximately 40 feet in diameter.
10. The radar contacts were observed for approximately 20 minutes before fading from the radar scope.
11. The color of the radar contacts was observed to be a bright white on the radar scope.
