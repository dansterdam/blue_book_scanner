Preliminary Investigation of UFO Reports, May 19 - 22, 1964.
William T. Powers, Systems Engineer, Dearborn Observatory

On Friday night, May 22-23, I made a brief telephone survey in response
to a request by J. A. Hynek, Director of Dearborn Observatory, following his
appraisal of a UFI report of sightings in Lansing, Michigan.

My first call was to UPI in Chicago; a report of a UFO sighting had come
in, but from Marion, Indiana. A subsequent call to UPI in Lansing established
that reports were coming independently from both locations.

I contacted the Police Department in Marion, and was informed that
police officers in the Marion force and in police departments of surrounding
towns ( Tipton, Hartford, Tipton County Sheriff's office, etc.) had
during the past three nights witnessed either single lights or groups of lights, both stationary and moving,
which struck witnesses as unusual enough to report. Calls to several of the
other departments in the area did not add much information, as the witnesses were
on patrol or were not on duty at the time. In every case I was assured that the
witnesses would be available if a complete investigation were carried out; in most
cases the sightings were logged, or else the force is small enough that the
individuals involved will be easy to find.

I did succeed in locating one witness who saw an orange light low in the
northwest sky, apparently "200 - 500 feet high, three to six miles away", having
driven to the west end of town ( Hartford City) after hearing over his police car
radio comments about other sightings in progress. The officer,
Robert Meredith, reports that the Blackford county [redacted], and
another man named [redacted] saw the orange light. It seems clear that the
object was Venus, just prior to setting.

The other reports may involve more definite motion, and some involve
multiple objects ( at least one observation through binoculars), so the Venus
explanation cannot readily be extended without further information.

Having established that enough information could be obtained through the

The first lensing call was to the Lansing Police Department, where I
R.
spoke with Sgt. Snyder. A series of calls had been received from residents
of Southern Lansing for several days, starting at 3 AM on Wednesday morning, May
20. A list of names was obtained from the log of Wednesday, all from people who
complained of a "weird noise." This noise was described approximately as a
a "whirring" noise, starting low and going high, then stopping. In a subsequent
call to the Ingham County Sheriff's office, I was informed that at 3AM Wednesday
morning a police car had made an emergency run down Miller street, employing a
new "warbling" siren, which the desk sergeant described as sounding "weird."
When I read him the list of addresses of the complainants, he identified most
but not all, of them as being close to the route of the emergency run.
It was also found that an elephant was tethered all night in a shopping center
nearby, part of a promotion stunt.

The reports of 3 AM Wednesday, therefore, may tentatively be connected with
the known emergency run, at least those definitely concerned with noises, which I
understand is true in all cases.

Reports from Thursday and Friday night, however, cannot be connected with
the siren, as objects were seen. There appear to be several independent sightings
of different objects.

One object, a bright blue or blue-green light, was seen descending "to the
ground" ( that is, going out of sight following a downward course) by two people,
Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. Each was in his own car on the way home
when he caught sight of the object. Both were impressed sufficiently to attempt to
drive to where the object disappeared, and both seem to have thought it might be
an aircraft in trouble. The men met subsequently, while [redacted] was acting in his
capacity of television announcer ( for WILX) at a remote broadcast from
restaurant [redacted] in Lansing, and here they each learned that the
other had seen the light. Unfortunately, it appears that they have already compared
their stories, as both reported to me in phone calls Saturday morning that

the sighting took place at "12:10 to 12:15".) Both men have agreed to cooperate
in any detailed investigation.

One of the calls associated with the night of the emergency run previously
mentioned was from a farmer in Grand Ledge, who called the
department with a report that he had seen a flying saucer land and take off again.
A police car 5 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the
farmer, whose name was not obtained, said that the object was gone; the investigation
patrol reported sighting nothing unusual, so the sighting was not logged; the name
of the farmer may be difficult to discover. The farmer said the object was blue/and
roared and was
/15 feet in diameter. The police officer clearly believes the man to be "mistaken".

There are several more reports which need to be straightened out better then
I could do over the telephone. One involves two men coming home from the night shift
(apparently) at Oldsmobile, and a wife. The two men were
in a car parked in front of Spears' house when/heard a weird noise ( apparently not
the siren - time is wrong) and saw an object that looked like a shooting star
going behind the house. It made ( or something made) a sufficiently impressive noise
the wife jumped out of bed, terrified, the sound having awakened her.

Between phone calls to and on Saturday morning, I received
an unsolicited call from a reporter of the Lansing State-Journal, who
was trying to find out if my calls of the night before were legitimate, and who had
another report which came in just after I had ceased operations Friday night. A Mrs.
Rd., Lansing, saw three objects as 9:00, 9:45, and
11:00 PM on the 20th, at least one of which showed shape ( outline, not point source)
and which was observed through binoculars. Mrs. husband also saw the objects
and they called some neighbors who also were witnesses. One object was described
as roughly circular with many little white lights on its underside. Mrs. did
not report until she heard of other reports, for fear she would be called crazy.
says she is willing to talk to scientists from Northwestern ( informed
her of our investigations). Mrs. address is described as being "near

Here is the text from the document:

[a street which appears on the list of complainants (not in chronological order) from Wednesday night, and which should be checked as possibly involving a different report from the "noise" reports.

Saturday afternoon the final call before making this report was received from (not "Castro") Sgt Gast[redacted]/of the Michigan State Police, in response to my request for additional information that might arise. He reported that a Mrs.[redacted] of Lansing, had just reported that she heard on the night of the 20th a very strange "whirring" sound from her back yard, at 9:00 or 9:15 PM. She saw nothing, but found a burned area in her yard, about 10 feet by 4 or 5 feet in dimensions. Leaves lying on the ground were charred, but the grass underneath was not. She has saved samples of the leaves, and is willing to be interviewed. She, too, delayed her report for fear of ridicule, until other reports were publicized. Her husband saw what she saw, heard the noise.

This brief report actually represents only a small portion of the reports that were received and logged at the police departments in the area. All police agencies appear quite willing to cooperate, and individuals seem to show a healthy mixture of interest and skepticism. My impression is that a more detailed reading of the logs together with examination of records of emergency-car movements will eliminate the bulk of reports concerned with noises only, but that other events appear to have occurred which require more detailed investigation and probably will call for several different explanations.

There follows a list of some of the persons who made reports; this is a very abbreviated list, and is given only for the purpose of aiding identification of the proper log pages or proper individuals with whom to communicate.
