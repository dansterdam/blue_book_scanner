the fields have found themselves of

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

Reference your letter concerning bunches of foil found in nearby fields.

These pieces of foil are known as "chaff". Dropped from aircraft in bundles, they quickly separate and each piece of chaff gives a radar return resembling an aircraft. These radar returns cluster, noting movement of the aircraft, making the movement effective as a way to tell they are extremely crafty. Slowly and normally the aircraft to pass slowly undetected. Chaff are dropped by USAF aircraft on practice missions.

Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

W. J. LOCKADOO
