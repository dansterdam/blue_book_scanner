TO: AFSC (FTD)

1. Reference our message 290IN 09010, dated 6 September 1966, on the UFO sighting reported by a civilian and by personnel of Finland AFS.

2. The initial report stated that the object was seen by personnel of Finley Indiana AFS.

3. The follow-up report submitted to this office by Lt Sumner, Intelligence Officer at Finland AFS, is forwarded as an attachment.

4. In the follow-up report, Lt Sumner mentions seeing another object the following evening (7 September 1966), which was also reported as a blue, green, and white light. This was similarly unintelligible and unexplainable.

5. On 7 September 1966, the witness, a Airman Second Class, reported seeing the object again. He watched it for less than two minutes as it moved to the southwest of Finland AFS.

6. The vague, contradictory, and confused nature of the reports makes it difficult to determine exactly what these people really saw, and such factors as time, direction, speed, or temperature inversions may have caused the sightings.

FROM: PIO RADAR O (DAFC)(ADC)(USAF)
FINLAND AFS, MINN.

SUBJECT: UFO'S

TO: 29 DIN

1. On the evening of 3 September 1966, this station became involved in a UFO sighting. It is understood that your office has submitted reports concerning the incident. Statements of airmen who claim to have observed the object have been procured from this station, and details as set forth therein.

2. As it occurred, this station was unaware of any extraordinary activity until the observations were reported. The Duluth (CONAD SAGE) Sgt. Smash called and, shortly after 2200 hrs, stated that an airman at this station had reported the observation of a UFO near the station. (This airman has been identified as a Sgt. Paulos, an airman stationed in the vicinity of the radar site).

3. At first, there were no returns in the area. The object was claimed to be about 5 miles from the 89 tower, but the 89 tower "got nothing," said the statement from the controller. Shortly thereafter, the object appeared back about 2.5 miles from the tower. As locals, the technicians cleared to look at the scopes observed this object for about 15 to 20 minutes. During this period, the object appeared first outside the radar sweep and then moved into the sweep. After the initial 15 to 20 minutes, the object had been scrambled from Duluth ABS and searched the area where it had been observed. Both aircraft and ground radar vehicles were alerted to the position, but no contact was made.

4. One of the observers, A/2C Tutty, claimed to have watched the "UFO" for some time with binoculars, and it admitted that he had used improper settings with the camera and had a color film which did not produce satisfactory results. He showed some people present at the scene.

5. The next evening, at 2200 hours, the "white-puff" type sighting was made. This sighting seemed to have been position it had for a few minutes and then it disappeared from the horizon and would settle beneath the horizon - a "pulsating" effect. It did appear to be hovering for a short time, but seemed somewhat lower than the previous evening's sighting.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
ON OR ABOUT 2145 HOURS ON THE 5TH OF SEPT, 1966, HE WAS ASKED TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT AN OBJECT THAT APPEARED IN THE WEST THAT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE A STAR. HE SAID THAT AFTER HE LOOKED AT IT HE SOON REALIZED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. HE NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED TO BE CHANGING SHAPE FREQUENTLY AND MANEUVERING INDEPENDENTLY AT ABOUT 1500 TO 2000 FEET. HE STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A DISC OF SOME SORT AND HAD VARYING SHADES OF GREEN LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE. IT ALSO HAD SOME SORT OF BULGE IN THE CENTER. HE SAID THAT AFTER HE CALLED THE OTHERS AND THEY WERE WATCHING IT THROUGH BINOCULARS, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STARTED MOVING VERY FAST TOWARD THE NORTH AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT WITHIN A FEW SECONDS. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. HE ASKED THEM IF THEY COULD SEE IT VISUALLY, AND THEY SAID THEY COULD. THE INITIAL CONTACT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2145 HOURS. LATER ON, AFTER THE OBJECT HAD MANEUVERED AND DISAPPEARED, THEY CONTINUED TO WATCH THE AREA FOR SOME THIRTY MINUTES OR MORE BUT NOTHING ELSE COULD BE OBSERVED. THE OBJECT MOVED WEST AND VISUAL CONTACT WAS LOST COMPLETELY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1. Description of Object: shape - round, color - reddish, blinking light, changing from red to green to red, size - one-half of full moon, formation - single, no distinct features. Sound - none. Features settled beneath the horizon, disappeared and vanished.

2. Description of Course of Object(s): remained at azimuth of 270 degrees, but which direction of travel - could not determine. Elevation of object varied from 10 to 30 degrees, descended to horizon, disappeared.

3. Time of Sighting: 2230-0130 hours, local time. Duration of sighting: approximately 3 to 4 hours.

4. Conditions During Observation: clear, starry night, with northern lights. AWE of US Weather Bureau report on similar winds in the area, temperature inversion, and possible thunderstorm conditions.

REPLY TO 
ATTN OF:  TDEER/Mr. Bryant/pk/70401

SUBJECT:  UFO Evaluation  

TO:       TDETR (Maj Quintanilla)

1.  The comment of the 29 NORAD Div Intelligence Officer, paragraph 3, 
    dis-CUSS Div IV-l letter 167 Sep 66, indicating the concurred 
    with this UFO Report.

2.  The UFO Report, 19 Sep 66, attached to the above referenced letter, 
    states that the "return moved away" from the two F-89 interceptors
    when they approached the object. According to the clouds, it would appear 
    almost impossible for the pilots to have not observed the target
    visually since the clouds were reasonably clear. There is no 
    estimation of the size of the "target" or "moving" jet clouds.

3.  The slight temperature inversions mentioned may have caused erratic
    and unpredictable radar returns. The fact that cluster on the height
    finder extended to 30,000 feet altitude at ranges from 13 to 24 miles
    suggests such a condition. Figure 220, Volume 2, FIST photograph of
    a height finder scope with clutter caused by anomalous propagation.
    (This appears to support graphically the conditions described.)

4.  The movement or "flitting around" of the target, always on the
    270- azimuth, suggests the conditions of a fixed ground target, due or
    course to anomalous propagation.

5.  Lacking more complete details, it is not possible to give a more
    definite conclusion as to the radar report and confirming visual
    sighting. The height and airspeed of the target appears to rule out the 
    usual types of aircraft, unless the height/speed does not designate the
    object as that location.
