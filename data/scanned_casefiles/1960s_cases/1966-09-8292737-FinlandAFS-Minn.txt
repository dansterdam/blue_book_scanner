11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted sparkling light, changing from red to green to red for about 3 hours. Object settled beneath the horizon and vanished. Object was basically stationary in the west. Object was allegedly picked up on radar, however, a radar analysis suggested that anomalous propagation was apparently the cause of the radar paint.

SUBJECT: UFO Follow-Up Report

TO: AFSC (FTD)     10AF (MINT)

1. Reference our message 290IN 09010, dated 6 September 1966, on the
UFO allegedly sighted by a civilian and by personnel of Finland AFS.

    a. The initial report stated that the object was seen by personnel of Finland AFS. This should have read Finland AFS.

    b. The follow-up report submitted to this office by Lt Sumner,
Intelligence Officer at Finland AFS, is forwarded as an attachment.

2. In the follow-up report, Lt Sumner mentions seeing another object
the following evening (0300Z, 7 September 1966). He also reported who
sent in the initial report, also reported seeing a blue, green, and
red light flying about southwest of Grand Marais, Minnesota at 0215Z,
7 September 1966. She watched the object for two hours and reported
that the light had a vapor trail. Further, Airman Second Class
Tarplee of Finland AFS saw a "round light" southwest of Finland AFS
at 0250Z, 7 September 1966. He watched it for less than two minutes
before it "vanished". It is possible the three new sightings are
related.

3. The vague, contradictory, and confused nature of the reports
makes it difficult to determine exactly what these people really
saw. Stars or temperature inversions may have caused the sightings,
and anomalous propagation or ground clutter may have caused the radar
returns.

Finland AFS, Minn. 95603
9 Sept 66

SUBJECT: UFO's

TO: 29 OIN

1. On the evening of 5 September 1966, this station became involved in UFO activity. It is understood that your office has submitted reports concerning the incident. Statements have been procured from airmen of the squadron who claim to have observed the occurrence. Each of the airmen (whose names are included in the attached report) stated the same things about the "UFO". The attached report is based upon their statements.

2. As it occurred, this station was unaware of any extraordinary activity until Mrs. (residing near Lutzen, Minn.) called and reported having observed a weird "flying object". Her call was relayed to Duluth (294D SAGE), Sgt Smith called and, shortly after 2200 hs, local time, airmen began to look for possible "UFO". As reported, the object was green, hovering at 500 feet, near her (Mrs. reported).

3. At first, there were no returns in the area Mrs. claimed the object to be in. The 99 tower at the 27 tower got nothing", said the airmen height technicians, A2C Lurie Dedie, another of the technicians, reported that there was "too much clutter to see anything in that area on radar..." Later, 2300 hrs, locals, the technicians detected a return on the FPS 90 scope. Varying in range from 13 to 5 miles, it "flitted around, but always stayed on the 270 degrees' azimuth." A pair of F-89s had been scrambled from Duluth AB and searched the area where the radar return was, but "the return moved away from them..." Both aircraft maneuvered around the location, searching at altitudes of 8 to 10,000 feet. Asked about the clutter, the airmen claimed that the radar showed the clutter extending to 3,000 feet and the UFO return was some (6-10,000'). The return of the "UFO" remained on the scope for periods of two to four minutes and then vanished, reappearing at a different range, but remaining at azimuth of 270 degrees.

4. One of the observers, PFC Tutty, claimed to have watched the "UFO" from the hill top and took photographs. Asked about the pictures, he admitted that he had used infrared film, with one camera and had a color film, with low ASA rating, in the second. No photos were produced.

5. The next evening, at 2200 hours, the "white-green" object reappeared in the sky at exactly the same position it had appeared on 5 September. This officer observed it and detained it to be a point which was near the horizon and would settle beneath the horizon after midnight. It did appear to "sparkle" in red-green-white colors, but so other stars which can be pointed out from this mountain top.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNS:

ON OR ABOUT 225w HRS. THE 5TH OF SEPT. 1966, I WAS ASKED TO TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE TO THE NORTH WEST FOR A PLANE BY THE COM-CENTER. I SAW AN OBJECT TO THE WEST THAT AT FIRST I THOUGHT TO BE A STAR. I WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES AND SAW THAT IT WAS MOVING BUT NOT LEAVING ITS GENERAL LOCATION. IT WAS MOSTLY WHITE WITH A NEL FRINGE AT ONE END AND OVAL SHAPED SITTING AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TO THE HORIZON. I THEN RETURNED TO THE SAGE BUILDING AND RE-PORTED TO THE COMPUTER TO THE COMPUTER ROOM AND CYCLED UP THE ACTIVE AIR DEFENCE PROGRAM ON THE BUIC SAGE COMPUTER. I THEN WENT TO THE CONSOLE ROOM TO SEE IF I COULD BE SEEN ON A SCOPE. I FOUND A PAINT ON THE SCOPE AT 270 DEGREES SE OF THE SITE AT ABOUT 5.6 MILES. I WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH IT TO BE A SOLID OBJECT NOT MOVING FROM ITS LOCATION. AT THIS TIME I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE SD AIR YOUTH. HE ASKED IF WE COULD SEE ANYTHING. I TOLD HIM WE COULD AND THAT WE ALSO HAD VISUAL CONTACT. I THEN HELPED HIM BY KEEPING HIM INFORMED OF THE LOCATION. THE VISUAL INFORMATION PASSED BY TRACKING THE OBJECT. AS THE FIGHTERS FROM DULUTH GOT CLOSE IN TO THE OBJECT SEVERAL F-106 CAME IN TO TELL ME IT WAS MOVING UP AND AWAY IN A WESTERN DIRECTION. I CONFIRMED THIS ON THE SCOPE AND PASSED THE INFORMATION ON TO THE SD. THE OBJECT MOVED WEST TO ABOUT 15 MILES AND DIDN'T MOVE FROM THIS SPOT UNTIL CONTACT WAS LOST SOME TIME LATER. THE OBJECT MOVED WEST VISUAL CONTACT WAS LOST. I CONTINUED TO TRY AND HELP THE SD BY GIVING HIM HELP WITH THE LOCATION OF THIS AIRCRAFT TO THE OBJECT. CONTACT WAS LOST COMPLETELY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES.

SUBJECT: UFO Evaluation                                                   12 Oct 66

TO: TDEER (Maj Quintanilla)

1. The comment of the 29 NORAD Div Intelligence Officer, paragraph 3, 29th Air Division letter of 27 Sep 66, regarding the vague, contradictory and confused nature of the reports, is concurred in by this office.

2. The UFO Report, 19 Sep 66, attached to the above referenced letter, states that the "return moved away" from the F-89 interceptors when they approached; the teletype report says they "merged" with the blip. With 15-mile visibility and scattered clouds, it would appear almost impossible for the pilots to have not observed the target visually at close range at the time of "merging," yet there is no indication that this was the case.

3. The slight temperature inversions mentioned may have caused erratic and unpredictable radar returns. The fact that clutter on the height finder extended to 3000 feet altitude at ranges from 13 to 54 miles suggests such a condition. (Figure 7-19, page 220, Volume 2, MIT Radiation Laboratory Series, "Radar Aids to Navigation" shows the photograph of a height finder scope with clutter caused by anomalous propagation. It appears to depict graphically the conditions described in this report.)

4. The movement, or "flitting around" of the target, always on the 270° azimuth, suggests a reflection of a fixed ground target, due, of course, to anomalous propagation.

5. Lacking more complete details, it is not possible to give a more definitive evaluation of the radar portion of the sighting. The merging of interceptors and the target at the altitude the height finder designated for the target appears to rule out the target as a material object at that location.
