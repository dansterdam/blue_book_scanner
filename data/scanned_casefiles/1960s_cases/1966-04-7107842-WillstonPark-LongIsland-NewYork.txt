11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer saw 8 circulating lights. Lights were flashing in a sequence with a break of two spaces. The 8 lights would go on and off in the same sequence. About 50 feet above the 8 lights was one light which remained constant. The object crossed directly over head traveling slowly, about the speed of a light plane.

with one pattern of regularity.
As it drew the distance of about
1/2 mile the object suddenly was
hovering just to my left and
at an altitude of about 1000-1500 feet.
At this time the lights were
flashing in sequence with a
definite break after 8 lights
then a break of 2 spaces then
the 8 lights going on/off in same
sequence. The lights were definitely
circulating. At a point so (?) alone
the unculating lights there was one
light which remained constant

When stopped for the traffic signal
at Searingtown Rd. the object
was hovering to the left of Cypress
way - when I reached Setter Rock
Rd. I turned right and proceeded
north - as long during about
1/8 mile the object crossed directly
overhead and moved fairly
slowly out over Hempstead Harbor.
the time lapse involved was
approximately 3-6 minutes.

The speed of the disappearing
object was that of a slow flying
plane -

The object give the appearance
of being shaped as a top:

O = yellow-light

The sequence of lights went left to
right at a very rapid speed, then
a break of about 2 spaces + resuming
the sequence of 8. Each light gave
off a size of different that of the house
window - with the entire object
being at least as large as a 2 story
house -

The document includes a hand-drawn sketch of an object with a circular top and a rectangular base, with numbered sections on the base and a circular object at the top.

I am a captain of police in N.Y.
City assigned to Detective Division
and I feel certain that the object
I saw last night was definitely
that of a giant top dragged object
not that of a plane etc-

To Whom it May Concern:
Dear Sir,

Last night at about 8:10 PM accompanied by my 14 yr old son, I was driving along the Service road of the Long Is Expressway from Willis Ave. to Shelter Rock Rd. when I observed flashing lights in the West. (Driving from West to East)

I called it to the attention of my son to look straight ahead - am placing the lights at a location of the 1964-65 Worlds Fair Grounds and the lights - about 8 circulating
