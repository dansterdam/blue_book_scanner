Satellite (Echo II)

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted], 1 May 1967

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your recent letter regarding your unidentified observation. A check of the satellite schedules revealed you probably observed Echo II. This satellite would have been passing over the central Ohio area at approximately 1929 SST on April 29, 1967 in a northerly direction.

I am unaware of the satellite which was visible at 2042; however, our records do indicate Echo II would have been visible at the above mentioned time and moving toward the north.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
