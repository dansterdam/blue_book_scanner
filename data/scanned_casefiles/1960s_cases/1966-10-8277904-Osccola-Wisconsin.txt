11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a stationary object suddenly speed up and move toward the western sky. Then an object was stationary at a very small orange moon. After the object took off it moved toward west and was very white as it moved across the sky. The object appeared to be traveling away from the observers.

It appears that the moon could have been responsible for the initial observation. At the time of the sighting the moon would have been on at an elevation of 70 degrees and an azimuth of approximately 25 degrees. This could have well accounted for the initial observation but could not

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 14 Oct. 66
    Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

When it was first sighted it was in the N.E. and stationary. It was stationary, about 10 minutes, then suddenly took off very fast and moved to the W.N.W. When in the North it suddenly looked white on the right side. Then seemed to go back to the original orange again as it moved on.

By this time we were some 4 miles from it. I glanced and looked at it through them. That's when you could see it was round as it appeared with the naked eye, but was pitted on the bottom. It was getting feather away and smaller. 9/16 parents did not see it till Mr. Johnson and I reached home and drew their attention to it.
