The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

By the time it was sighted again it seemed to go through them. There was no sound as far as could be recognized, as it was not heard at all, after a time it seemed to go in a different direction and was seen no more.
It had wings of smaller dimension and smaller as was estimated to appear at it front or sides as it moved.
