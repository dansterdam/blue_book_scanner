The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The diagram appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, and it shows instructions for a person to sketch the motion and direction of an observed object or objects in the sky.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a SKETCH of how they were grouped, and put an arrow to show the direction that they took.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It ascended vertically out of sight.
