11. COMMENTS
There is the possibility that this sighting could have been caused by air mixing with cold dry air, as some sightings were reported from the same radar station and were not on the same equipment. No reports from other stations in the area were received which might have confirmed or denied this explanation, and weather conditions probably caused this radar effect.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force, dated 4 Oct 60, regarding the evaluation of a UFO sighting. The document references radar sightings reported on 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60, all from the same radar station. The sightings are described as unidentified targets that were picked up by the radar and occasionally displayed reflections from various weather situations. No similar targets have been reported from other stations, according to the document.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-4e1a/Mr. ggggggggg/jc/74201

SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFO (U)

TO: AFCIN-4e2x

1. Reference your memos dated 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60.
2. All three radar sightings reported are from the same radar station and were noted on the same radar equipment. This equipment is quite powerful and occasionally picks up reflections from various weather situations such as is encountered when dealing with cold dry air. The appearance and disappearance of targets as reported, along with the extremely rapid changes in altitude, indicate to the possibility that some form of weather condition was responsible for the unidentified targets which were reported.
3. No reports of similar targets have been received from other stations in the area which might have confirmed or denied this explanation.
