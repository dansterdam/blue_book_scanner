10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING                            11. COMMENTS
Normal a/c return painted on ground radar at             There is the possibility that this
70,000 ft rapidly gaining altitude to 100,000             sighting could have been caused by
ft, went off scope after 45 sec.                          warm moist air mixing with cold dry
                                                          air. Three sightings were reported
                                                          from the same radar station and were
                                                          noted on the same equipment. No reports
                                                          from other stations in the area were
                                                          received which might have confirmed or
                                                          denied the explanation that weather
                                                          conditions probably caused this radar
                                                          effect.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFOIN-4Ela/Mr. [partially redacted]/jc/74201

SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFO (U)                                                   4 Oct 60

TO: AFOIN-482x

1. Reference your memos dated 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60.

2. All three radar sightings reported are from the same radar station and were noted on the same radar equipment. This equipment is quite powerful and occasionally picks up reflections from various weather situations such as is encountered when warm moist air is mixed with cold dry air. The appearance and disappearance of targets are reported, along with the extremely fast changes in altitude, lends credence to the possibility that some form of weather condition was responsible for the unidentified targets which were reported.

3. No reports of similar targets have been received from other stations in the area which might have confirmed or denied this explanation.
