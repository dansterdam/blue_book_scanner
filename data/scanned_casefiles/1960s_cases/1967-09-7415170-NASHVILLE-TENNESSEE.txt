Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am writing to you concerning two U.F.O.s which I have witnessed on the night of September 21, 1967. The objects were of orange color and shape. And were sighted in an area as a medium size. And were sighted in the southern skies just after dusk approximately 7:19 PM. One was so to spin with ease and travel westerly. The other object seemed to hover settle down and it traveled southerly. The objects traveled at a very fast speed. The strange thing was they seemed to travel in a series of zigzags. But I am sure the atmosphere made them do this. If I have been critical at utilities so that the same. But I do know they weren't motors aircraft, or swamp gas!

Sincerely,

P.S. There were 5 other witnesses of these objects.

September 22, 1967

Major Hector Quintanilla
Project Blue Book

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am writing to you concerning two U.F.O.'s which I witnessed on the night of September 21, 1967. The objects were of orange color and level. They were about as large as a medium-sized star. And were sighted in the southern ship just after dusk approximately 7:19 PM. One seemed to spin while outside and travel westerly. The other object seemed to move outside and it traveled easterly. The objects traveled at a very great speed.

The strange thing was that it seemed to travel in a series of dips. But I guess the atmosphere made them do this. So I have been artificial satellites so that till now. But I do know they weren't meteors, aircraft, or swamp gas!

Sincerely,

P.S. There were 5 other witnesses of these objects.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I wish to know but do not know what the objects were. They seemed to travel like artificial satellites which I have observed before but the objects were like nothing I have seen before. Some of the other observers say they saw it travel a little differently but I must assure you the observation was very strange.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
