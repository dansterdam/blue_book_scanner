Here is the OCR text from the document:

In your opinion was it far light the object was being seen when I first saw the object I was nearly sure it was a star. After I studied it more closely I was more convinced the call wasn't a star. It was a very small object, and it was quite a mile. There was no to me what a person to be amazed about, but the sky as completely clear.

Companions telescope yet did not. With a small point of light. The object was of magnitude ..., brighter than Sirius but will fade to a small side of 5 or 6. There it could not easily be seen. The point vertical then was 4 deg of visibility, at the end of six minutes the object had gone.

I can't say I was not excited. "The object can't have looked like this, it was also in one place much to long for a star.

What was the speed of the object: none.
