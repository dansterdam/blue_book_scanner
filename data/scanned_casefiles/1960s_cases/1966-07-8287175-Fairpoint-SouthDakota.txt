10. CONCLUSION
1. Aircraft (possible) + scintgel effects
2. Other (Ground lights reflected off haze patches in the area)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
Several

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were watching sunset when a red object was seen just above the horizon. The object disappeared below the horizon, but was seen later when observers moved to a new position. After red object disappeared a second time, a greenish white object was seen moving in very close to the red object. Then three objects were noted in the west. The objects were moving, with a green object darting rapidly back and forth between the yellow objects.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
1. 15 minutes
2. 1 hour & 30 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground Visual

7. COURSE
West & North West

8. PHOTOS
□ Yes

Investigating officer feels that sightings were caused by lights on aircraft flying low in the area and by reflected and refracted lights off the haze patches in the area. This is the second incident reported in two days by the same airman.

IMATELY FIVE TO EIGHT MILES DUE NORTH OF HIS POSITION, AND
IT APPEARED TO BE STANDING STILL. THE GREENISH WHITE OBJECT
WAS SEEN MOVING IN VERY CLOSE TO RED OBJECT. THE OBSERVERS
THEN NOTICED THREE OTHER OBJECT DUE WEST OF THEIR POSITION,
MOVING VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND. THE TWO OUTSIDE OBJECTS WERE
YELLOW, WITH A GREEN OBJECT DARTING RAPIDLY BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN THE YELLOW OBJECTS.

5. THE OBSERVERS WERE RECALLED FROM THE HILL POSITION AFTER
APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES. OBJECTS WERE STILL
IN SIGHT.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted 5 separate and distinct objects. The largest one was oval, the four others round. Various colors reported by those who witnessed the objects. The two largest objects were fairly stable at an altitude of 500-800 feet moving east or west depending on which observation point was reporting. The smaller object continually darted around the larger ones ranging as far out as 1500 to 10,700 ft.

Two witnesses reported objects to three others. These three witnesses reported different times and azimuth on which the sighting occurred. The star CAPELLA could have been responsible for the observation. Capella was rising in the NE sky as was reported by two of the observers.
