2. Other (Ground lights reflected off haze patches in the area)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were watching a bright object when a red object appeared above the horizon. The red object disappeared. After a short time, another object was seen later when observers changed position. After red object disappeared, a second rish white object was seen moving in very close to the ground. Then three yellow-orange objects were seen moving very close to the ground, in and out between the yellow objects.
Investigating officer feels that sightings were likely on aircraft flying low in the area and to reflected lights off the haze patches in the area as indicated by the witness statement in two days by the same observer.

The text states that observers noted 5 separate and distinct objects that were fairly stable at an altitude of 5000 or west depending on which observation is considered. The smaller objects continued to dart in and out ranging as far out as 1500 to 10,000 ft. Two witnesses reported objects to three witnesses at different times and different sightings occurred. The star CASTOR was responsible for the observation, as per NE sky as was reported by two of the observers.

K. COMMENTS ON RELIABILITY OF SIGHTING PROBABLY CAUSE, ETC. IT SEEMS THAT WITH THE STORMS REPORTED IN THE AREA, PLUS TEMPERATURE INVERSION, LIGHTS ON THE GROUND REFLECTING FROM THE CLOUDS, MOVING RAPIDLY WITH THE WIND, CAUSED THE REPORTING PERSONNEL TO ASSUME THAT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS WERE PRESENT.
I DO NOT FEEL THAT ANY DANGER TO THE MISSILE COMPLEX EXISTS.
