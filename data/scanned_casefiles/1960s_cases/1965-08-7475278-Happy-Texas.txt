k. Comments of preparing officer:

The [redacted] family appeared hospitable and cooperative, answering all questions asked without drawing any conclusions. The children were well informed on UFO sightings in and around this area and had read numerous books and newspaper articles on the subject. The parents stated that the object did not appear to be a meteorite or an airplane since in their opinion it was slower than the former and faster than the latter. Amarillo Approach Control radar and the 668th ACGW Squadron had no contact with the object.

Since there are no airways in the vicinity, the probability of the object being an aircraft is slight. In the opinion of the investigating officer, the object was either a large meteorite or a satellite.

3. The information on the sighting at Andrews, Texas, is identical to that listed above with the following exceptions:
   b. (3) About 20° above horizon
   (4) A straight line from northwest to southeast.
