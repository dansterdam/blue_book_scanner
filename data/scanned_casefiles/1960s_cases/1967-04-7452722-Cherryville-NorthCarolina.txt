Aircraft (possibly)                                                12 APR 67

Gentlemen:

I wrote you about 4 months or so ago for some of your U.F.O. material. When I got it back I was reading it and now I remember a little to fill out if I would see something unusual. I can't figure out whether I believe in them or not but I saw something that really scared me that night. My table starts on the next page.

P.S.
Please write my friend, because he also spotted a U.F.O., but not the one I spotted. He spotted his about a month earlier. He's address is:

Cherryville, N.C. Box                                   Please write him and ask him about the object.
