Eugene Gwinn, Capt. of fireman
Washtngton, D.C.
Serial: 08-6-62
SUBJECT: Sighting of a Unidentified Flying object on Saturday, 6 Oct 62.
While on routine patrol duty, I observed a lighted object approximately 1000 ft. above the ground which appeared to be moving in a westerly direction at a speed estimated to be approximately 200 mph. The object was observed for approximately two minutes before disappearing behind a hill.
Description of Object:
The object was about 40 to 50 ft. in diameter and appeared to be circular in shape. It emitted a bright glow and was easily visible in the night sky. There were no wings, tails, or other appendages visible and no sound was noted. The object maintained a steady speed and altitude throughout the sighting.
I observed this particular sighting on two previous occasions, once in June, and once in August of this year. On both occasions the object was observed under similar circumstances and exhibited the same general characteristics as described above.
This report is being submitted for your information and any further investigation you may deem appropriate.

The Report Reads:
The report was written in field glass - air speed was high, it paced the aircraft for a short time then accelerated and disappeared. The witness stated that it was a round or disc-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, that was glowing white and moved with no sound. It was observed for about 15-20 seconds. The witness reported that he had about 30 other witnesses to confirm this sighting.
The object was seen about 4 miles south of Pacific Grove, California at an altitude of 1500 feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 1200 mph.
The report states that the object was unlike anything the witness had ever seen before and that it was not an aircraft, satellite, or any other known object.
