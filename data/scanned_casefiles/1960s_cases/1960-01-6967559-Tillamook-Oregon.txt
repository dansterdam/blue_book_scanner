One

9. COURSE
Circling NW

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round object size of auto light about a block away, radius on compass in color observed at 35 deg elev 310 deg az. Believed to be a star. Object remained motionless for 30 sec and then began circling in eve increasing spirals and reached 45 deg elev 310 deg az where it rose suddenly at angle of 60-80 deg and faded from sight. Total observation time 5 minutes.

11. COMMENTS
Pattern of observation conforms to pattern of an astronomical body, except for the elevation. However there was no body of sufficient size to generate the sighting in the location given by the observer. The appearance and disappearance on the same heading point to this conclusion and the circling would be attributed to fluctuation of the object. Witness did not give the size of the circles, speed of motion, and no conclusion can be reached. Case listed as insufficient data.
