Personnel contact was made with the witnesses and they said that the object was first thought to be a bright star but the object kept changing colors and the witnesses began to wonder. 3° nights later the witness was asked if he saw a similar object. One of the witnesses said that there was a similar object in the sky and pointed to Capella. When asked if that was like the object he had seen he said that it was.

Do not discuss the report with any civilian callers. Only the Office of Information, Hq. USAF, is authorized to release information concerning UFO reports. If you are called by members of the press, ask them to please call the Information Officer, Capt. Craig at 288-2747, or his assistant, Lt. Campbell at base ext. 398.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 483. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
