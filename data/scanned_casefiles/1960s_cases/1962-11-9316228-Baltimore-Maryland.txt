To Officer In Charge;
Research and Development, Cape
Canaveral, Florida.

Sir,

I am a night dispatcher for
the Edgewater Cab Co. in Middle
River, Md. On my way home
from work this morning at
approximately 5:40 A.M. Eastern
Standard Time I observed a point
object in the sky, due south from
Middle River, which seemed to
be moving on an erratic course.

I.T formed a funny looking
shape in the sky and as I
watched it the design it
made in the sky became
larger and larger until
it covered about one-fifth of
the distance between the
