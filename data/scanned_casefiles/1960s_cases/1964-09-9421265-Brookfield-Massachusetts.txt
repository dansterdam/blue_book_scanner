COMMENTS: Three objects observed in September 1964, reported to the Air Force in letter few in May 1965. Too old to investigate. Sighting is characteristic of a misinterpretation of an Astro Body such as a star/planet if the motion is confined to a small area of the sky. Possible a/c activity included. Insufficient data for an evaluation.

Gentlemen:

On September 4, 1964 a LF-LJ was spotted in Brookfield, Mass., above Lake Quaboag. Witnesses were: [redacted] of Pine Lane in Brookfield Mass., myself [redacted].

The LF-LJ (seen clearly through binoculars) was completely solid, oval shaped, as wing around it and a glow coming from the top of it.

Without binoculars it looked only like a bright red speck in the sky. It seemed to fly at high speed and after circling the lake a couple of times it returned, with another LF-LJ. After they circled a couple of times they later came back with a thick, then seemed to disappear faintly.

There are also two postage stamps and a postmark visible, but the text on those is not fully legible from this image.
