Dear Sir:

I am writing to ask you for some information on an unidentified Flying Object. Here is my report: Time: 850 pm. Eastern Standard Time, Date: April 27, 1963, Location: "South 15"

First Ascension: The 35min. Desc. "Unidentified Flying Object Flying NW-Southeast". The approximate magnitude is -2. It's diameter is about from one-fifteenth degrees to one twenty-fifth degrees looking through our telescopes at 10 power, with a three quarter inch focal length. It was moving about 20 every one minute. It had four real satellites. The first two were visible about ten seconds and then disappeared. There were three sky objects visible in the twilight sky. They were blue, the moon and the UFO. The length of duration was about three to four minutes. The object appeared to be moving in an out and motion when it disappeared. My fellow astronomer and I were playing cards waiting for the sky to set so that we could look through our telescopes. When I said let's now to locate something, I went to the window and could not see it so we went

out sit because we got it better. Then we got out there, got, there I is, and I said no because Hirus is near the horizon, so. We sent looking for our telescopes, aimed it at the Po, and there appeared a very large disc with four satellites moving around it.

We were looking at it and at the same time trying to take notes in it. Tom went over to get his mother who lives next door to me. Bythe time he got back, it was more. In the mean time I could still see the object through my scope moving in an altered rotation. It got very small and then it disappeared. About one half a second later, two other satellites followed it, then they disappeared.

I sent a Dr. Donald W. Hansel, the director of a word going observatory, and he said that the Air Force might want to know all about it. If you want to know more about the object, please do not hesitate to write me. Will you please send me some address to write to so that I will know who to write to in case something else strange will come.

Cordially yours,
