Dear Sir:

I feel that the information that I have should first come to your attention. I was told by a neighbor who has seen an object suspended in the sky for "four to five minutes" over the lake in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, on Friday, February 3, 1967.

Time: Between 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. Duration 4-5 minutes
Location: "In the southwest of Chagrin Falls", Ohio.

Witness: (name redacted)
(address redacted)

Description: When I first saw "it", I thought to be a star which appeared stationary. However, it was the only object in the sky and had a reddish or orange glow surrounding it, which was very pronounced and appeared to move or change shape. After about a minute or so, the object began to move slowly to the left or southwest, then stopped for a short period, then moved back again to its original position and hovered there. I noticed it seemed to change shape and color, going from a reddish glow to a brighter white or bluish-white color. At one point, it appeared oval-shaped. After about 4-5 minutes, it simply disappeared from view. I am at a loss to describe it adequately, as it did not behave at all like an aircraft or star, and I have never seen anything like it before.

I'd be interested in any comment or evaluation you might have on this incident. My nights are quite restless with the thought of the experience.

Sincerely,
(name redacted)

Enclosed are notes that I took that night.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document with text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

Time was about 9:30 PM on the date mentioned above. First noticed a strange light in the sky which appeared to be moving. It seemed to be about the size of a dime at arm's length. As it drew closer it appeared to be quite large, possibly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It seemed to be glowing, not flashing. It moved slowly at first, then seemed to pick up speed, and then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a few minutes, and then appeared to move away slowly, dimming as it moved into the distance. It made no sound that could be heard. The object appeared to be disc shaped.
