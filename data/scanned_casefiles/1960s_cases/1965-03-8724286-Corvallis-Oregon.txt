CORVALLIS, OREGON
4 MARCH 1965

Two observers, a driver and a passenger, in an automobile, were driving slowly on Toria Road, southeast of Corvallis, Oregon, when they sighted three lights, similar to roman candles, rising from the ground, several seconds apart. The lights appeared as yellow balls, about the size of a tennis ball and emitting light. The flight path was almost straight up to an altitude of about 200 feet where it disappeared.

Observer stated that on the next day he went back to the area where the object was spotted and there was a dark spot on the ground. There were no other visible tracks or markings to the observer. The observer obtained a dirt sample from the darker area in his field.

COMMENTS

Although the sighting is similar to a fireworks display, no evidence was uncovered that anyone was shooting flares or fireworks. Meteorological personnel and personnel of the Portland Air Defense Sector have revealed no correlation of this sighting with known air activity or natural phenomena. An analysis of the dirt indicated it contained a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil and no additional chemicals, such as nitrates or sulfer. Considering the information available, there is no explanation for the alleged sighting and the case is carried as unidentified.

The rest of the form contains standard administrative fields like "Approved By", "Project Engineer", etc., but many of these are either partially illegible or filled out in handwriting that is difficult to definitively transcribe.

The document appears to be a military administrative form, specifically an ASD (Aeronautical Systems Division) form dated DEC 61.

I. PURPOSE:
To analyze the sample for organic components that would be foreign to the sample.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
A sample of dirt was submitted to the Analytical Branch and assigned Analytical Branch Number 45-623. Approximately half the sample (1.05 grams) was extracted with carbon tetrachloride. The solvent was evaporated and an infrared spectrum obtained of the residue. The spectrum showed the residue to be a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil.

III. CONCLUSION:
The dirt sample was analyzed and found to contain a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil.
