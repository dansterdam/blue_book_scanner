Gentlemen:

I am 17 years old + am
sending you a sighting of
a U & O which I have
just encountered.

It was a clear night
on March 6, 1968, and
about 4:30 P.M. My friend
and I were stargazing
at various planets, stars,
+ the moon. The night
was not very cold, so
we decided to spend a
little more time out.
I was looking through
my fundscope, trying
to find saturn within it.

saw it! A blue mush-
room shaped spaceship
about 200 feet sm dia-
meter, coming over the
horiz on at tremndos
spud. It stopped, after
about 1/2 minute of
traveling and hovered
for about 15 min. I
had never seen anything
like it before. Hell, when
it had hovered the
middle of it started
spinning, and it traveled
out of sight. Thank
you for reading this.

Yours very truly,
