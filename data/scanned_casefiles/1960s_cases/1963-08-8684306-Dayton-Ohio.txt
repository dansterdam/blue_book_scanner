August 11-12. David R Williams wrote
at his and few other members of the

roughly to use 5th magnitude stars.

Ferry Daniels comments that two per-
sons were good at Jersey Shore, Penn-

11 p.m. EDT. He also logged a 5-6 sec-
ond bright meteor with a persistent train
of 4 magnitude - 3 left. A red fire-
ball of magnitude - 3 was seen several
seconds later.

At about 4:15 (EST), in the morning
"light" writes Stephen Forwerk of Fall
River, Massachusetts, "Fred Walcyk and
saw a spectacular fireball. It appeared
with a degree can of Alpha Persei and
brief a similar distance northwest of
that. The meteor burst a second at
the most, and was brilliant white. Its
magnitude was perhaps - 1 or - 2 (com-
pared to Venus). The fireball seemed
cautiful more where 6-7 degrees had
only slightly less than the approximate
10th path of the meteor. The train re-

More news from the
Black Country

The Wolverhampton Express
and Star on August 13 reported
further sightings over the district. Two well-authenticated
cases were reported with a
special unidentified flying object
with a 'hanging tail' have been
reported to the Express and Star
daily. One of them was from who
was in a garden at a Highland Road,
Sedgley, at about 10.30 p.m. last
night armed with binoculars. He
was looking towards the east
when he saw 'A bright, pear-
shaped white light, like a star
with a tail dropping other white
dropping off the bottom, and of
the eleven five were double
lights.

The witness described the light as
brighter than any star. It moved
towards the south, maintained an
even alliance. Although he could
not guess what the altitude was
and comment to disappear, the
object remained stationary. First
for about one and a half minutes.
It then disappeared for half a
minute, but came back into sight
for another half minute. After the
last sighting there was a dull
bang in the sky.

The second sighting was reported by Mr. J. Challenger, of
Gibbons Hill Road, Sedgley, a

Wolverhampton bus inspector,
who said: 'I have always treated
these stories with a certain
amount of scepticism. Mr. Challenger was walking from the main
Wolverhampton-Sedgley road towards his home with a family
party at 10.24 p.m. last night
when he saw in the sky to the
south-east a large white light,
much larger than a star, underneath a lot of low cloud. According to Mr. Challenger, the light
was stationary, but this light, too,
appeared to drop other smaller
lights. His twelve-year-old
daughter told him she had seen something similar on Saturday night.

Walsall police also received
two reports of an unidentified
object, showing an orange light,
hovering over Pleck police station and Ocker Hill, Tipton.

One report came from Mrs. Kathleen Edwards, of 86 Queen Mary
Street, Walsall, whose family was
disturbed by the object's passage
and the other from Mr. Raymond
Luban (22), of 37 Rosamond
Street, Walsall, who saw an object over the power station.

Yet another sighting report
came from Mr. A. Darby, of Vicarage Road, Moxley, who, just about
10.30 p.m., yesterday, was riding
a motor cycle from Moxley
roundabout towards Darlaston.
When he saw the object he drew
attention to his right. He stopped.
Mr. Orme described the object
as 'Like a flare in the sky. At first
I thought it was a rocket or a firework,' he said. Looking to his
right, he saw towards Walsall

and the isolation hospital,' the
light was orange and seemed
about a mile away. There was
no sound and, said Mr. Orme, it
was definitely not an aircraft. If it
described the behaviour of subsidiary lights underneath much as
other witnesses have done, but
said they went 'up and down'
underneath the main light. Some
of the witnesses saw the object's
main light for about the same
distance as they went below it.
At one time there were as many
as three subsidiary lights visible.
The whole performance, said
Orme, lasted about three
minutes.'

Activity over Gloucester

The Gloucester Citizen on August 21 returned to the subject of UFOs after a report had appeared in its August 17 issue. More strange objects in the Gloucester sky! This time they were seen by Mr. and Mrs. Gavin Riley, who are staying at 35 Teddington Gardens, Gloucester. Mr. Riley told The Citizen today: "My wife and I were walking towards our parked van in Brunswick Road after a visit to the cinema last night when:

my amazement I saw a cluster of lights in the sky speeding silently from cast to west." He said that he saw about eight or ten lights. Then suddenly they changed direction and hovered.

"As they did so they fanned out into an oval shape, apart from three at the rear end which lagged, or dropped down slightly. The remainder closed up with the remainder, however, to complete the oval, which glided off towards Bristol and disappeared."

"We are," he said, "thought to be about 2,000 feet. and on this assumption the span of the oval would be several hundred feet." Neither my wife nor I believe in flying saucers, but we cannot explain the object or objects we saw would appear to defy explanation."

LOCAL SIGHTINGS
AKRON, OHIO......8/16-17/63......11:15PM-1:00AM...Miss Becky Deger and Bruce Deger, 16 and 15 respectively were party to a sighting of a strange lighted object which ascribed 60° within an hour and a half.

They first saw it at about 200 elevation. (verified by positions of opening in tree) The radius, Jupiter & Saturn, were pointed out to them, but both insisted they had seen something other than the planets referred to. The following is Becky's description of the object:

According to Miss Deger the object's shape underwent a rhythmic change. Diagrams follow: ---white, with a change of shape. The object seemed to swing around horizontally, becoming a longer shape of luminous white. It would remain white for about 10 secs, then within a few seconds would revert to the hazy, but definitely yellow color. The yellow would persist for about 5 secs, then fade out to the very luminous white in 2 secs. This rhythmic change of shape and color was seen through-out the ascension for 1 3/4 hrs, although the observer did not watch constantly.

She said that the object appeared to turn. Her description of its movements ascending follows:

[A hand-drawn sketch of an ascension path is included]

The object's size was similar to the end of an ordinary pencil at arm's length. She thought it was distant.

Bruce described the object in almost identical terms as to rhythmic changes in shape and size (pea at arm's length) but he reversed the colors, the yellow with the longer shape. He also differed as to the cascading-upward descent described by his sister. In his opinion, the changing of the colors and shape might've given her this illusion. He noted no lateral movements in its ascension. Asked if he thought it was a scientific thing, he said he didn't know, but didn't think so.

He estimated its distance as not closer nor very far. Brooke of 1:00AM, at LOCATION, was August 17. Binolux 7 x 35 Binoculars were used, even with the naked eye, they could see the changes mentioned.

Baltimore, Maryland

Triangle In The Sky

On the night of 17 August 1963 at 7:30 p.m. EDT, Mrs. Bradberry, a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, observed a most unusual UFO in the sky overhead.

Viewed through binoculars from her location the object appeared to be triangular in shape with a red light emanating from one corner. By 10:00 p.m., the triangle was still in approximately the same location but clouds obscured it.

At 11:15 a.m., the triangle was visible again but it was smaller in size and the red light had dimmed. The position had changed somewhat in regards to a reference point she was using. Investigation by Robert D. Briele, associated with radio station WFBR in Baltimore, failed to turn up an explanation.

Pear-Shaped Object Over Balio.

On the same night as the Bradberry sighting, Mrs. George Spee of Baltimore observed a pear-shaped object high in the sky over the northeast portion of the city. She reported the object to WFBR immediately and viewed the object from 9:10 to 10:00 p.m. No sound or motion were detected and Mrs. Spee said the object was stationary and the whole object was red in color. No optics used in sighting, and investigation showed no weather balloons over Baltimore for three days.

Children Observe UAO

David and Michael Saunders of Ft. Kent, Maine, looked up from their play on the afternoon of 18 August, 1963, and saw a humming, slow-moving object which looked like two dinner plates fastened together, lip-to-lip, Ft. Kent is located in St. John Valley, and the account of the sighting was published in the St. John Valley Times which is published in Madawaska, Maine.

The youngsters called their Mother and Grandmother from the house, but by the time the women arrived, the object had disappeared over the hill. Aged nine and eight, David and Michael are sons of David Saunders of the Immigration Service, Ft. Kent (on the Canadian Border). Their father told the Times reporter later that he hadn't paid much attention to the sighting at the time, but then by a similar article in the Times should have aroused his interest, and decided to report his sons' story. Both Mr. and Mrs. Saunders agree, their boys are not inclined to story-telling, and that when David, the oldest, says he saw something, he means it.

David and Michael said that when the object passed over the hill, it just cleared the trees. Its hum was intermittent, like a radio which isn't functioning properly, being turned on and off. Both boys explained they were familiar with airplanes and helicopters, and that it didn't have wings or propellers and was going very slowly. They indicated that it looked as though it crossed the river on its way south. Saunders commented that this would be strange for aircraft as they are not supposed to cross the border.

The Saunders home is located on Frenchville Road, near Fort Kent. Lt. Rice of the Public Information Office at Fort Kent stated that experimental aircraft, whether Canadian or American, would be very unlikely to cross the international border.

On Saturday, the 17th of August, at 3:30 a.m., about 40 hours before the Saunders boys' sighting, a lone hiker stopped to rest at a road junction about two miles north of Cyr mountain on the road from Birch Point to St. David. Looking toward the south, he saw an object moving slowly toward the northwest. It was oval-shaped, appeared to give off a yellowish light similar to that of the moon. It moved along an irregular course, making frequent turns as sharp as a hundred degrees or less. The observer watched it for about fifteen minutes during which time it moved from the vicinity of the planet Saturn to the vicinity of the Constellation Orion. This latter sighting could not have inspired the Saunders boys sighting for it was not published until four days after the boys saw the discharped object.

WALES:
Bank manager's sighting

The revival of interest in flying
saucers has caused the news-
papers to devote considerable
space to the subject. The follow-
ing account is taken from the
South Wales Evening Post pub-
lished in Swansea on August 23.
    "Still wondering whether he
could believe his eyes, Swansea
bank manager, Mr. W. D. Evans,
told me today of the mysterious
object he saw in the sky over
Landland soon after midnight
'As large as a double-decker bus,
shaped like a jellyfish, and emit-
ting a red-orange pulsating glow,
it travelled silently from east to
west on a steady course between
40 m.p.h. and 50 m.p.h. at be-
tween 2,000 and 3,000 feet, he
said. And, similarly, he added:
'I had not been drinking. It was
a calm, clear night, and I want
to believe it happened. It was
extraordinarily eerie.'

    So convinced was Mr. Evans,
an ex-R.A.F. operations control
officer, that he immediately pos-
sessed for a full minute-and-a-
half was unearthly, that he rang
Swansea police and gave them a
full description. He called out
the R.A.F. air traffic control at
Landland, Mr. Desmond King, a
production manager, who saw the
object for about 15 seconds be-
fore it disappeared low down in
the direction of Mumbles light-
house.

    'Mr. Evans' wife also saw the
object, and the police had reports
from two taxi drivers who had
seen things in the sky.'

    Then though it was a hard watch
had come down at Southend.
Police searched the beach at
Southend but found nothing.

    R.A.F. air traffic control at
Uxbridge were informed but they
had no report of a distress
flare.

    'Said Mr. Evans: 'My wife
and I were returning home after
taking an accident case to hos-
pital, and as we passed the Pen-
land Bay Golf Club, I saw this
thing which I first thought was a
very large flare, but it passed
directly overhead, completely
unaffected by the wind. There
was a tremendous glow from the
thing. It was obviously going to
a plan. It was either controlled
from the ground or from inside.
But who could live in such an

inferno? The fact that it was so
low and such a tremendous spec-
tacle, cuts out any suggestion of
a meteor.'

    'It was the shape of a shuttle-
cock or jelly fish, and travelled
low, steadily and majestically. It
was something sufficiently un-
usual to be quite frightening to
have always been sceptical about
flying saucers, but this is noth-
ing clean outside normal human
experience so far as I am con-
cerned.'

    'Mr. King confirmed that the
object emitted an orange light,
was moving in a straight line at a
steady altitude, was silent and
travelling from east to west.'

    'I had not seen anything like
it in my life. I was quite fasci-
nated, but cannot think of any
explanation. It was nothing like a
meteorite, and I would not have
thought it was a flare,' he said.

    Coastguards on look-out duty
at Mumbles saw no object to sea-
ward.

    'From reports we have had
from the police, the object must
have come from a definite direc-
tion. Our view, it was a rocket or flare
fired by some unauthorised per-
son. There was no distress flare
last night,' said a spokesman.

"Round with a flat top"

The Wadsworth Borough News on August 28 gave the following account of a sighting in the district: "A clear and lucid account of a mysterious flying object sighted at 1:45 a.m. last Monday (August 26) was given to the Wadsworth Borough News by ten-year-old David Anthony Mohan, who lives at 13 Grantley House, Ackrydon Estate.

Suddenly I saw something moving," said David. "It was travelling in a northeasterly direction and seemed to pass right over the top of Timperley Court. It was fairly high and seemed to be moving at about 60 m.p.h. Although the sun wasn't shining, it was glistening brightly like whitish silver. I had a very good view, continued David, and it was too large to be a balloon. I think it was about a hundred feet in diameter. It was round in shape but had a flat top, like a platform. It seemed to be on a deck. From underneath was sticking out a long object like a wireless aerial, quite straight. While I watched it, he added, I saw it for about 10 seconds and it disappeared behind a small cloud. I wanted for it to come out of the other side but it did not reappear.

Close questioning does not shake any detail of David's story. He is accustomed to seeing plenty of aircraft, but is positive that he has never before seen any object like this. The object was seen across Ackrydon Estate on Monday morning, David's family occupy one of the top maisonette flats of Grantley House, and David was looking out of the window that morning. On the skyline in front of him was the tall block named Timperley Court on an adjoining estate. It was a cloudy morning with no sunshine, the light was quite dull.
