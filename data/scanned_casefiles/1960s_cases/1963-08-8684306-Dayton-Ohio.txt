More news from the 
Black Country

The Wolverhampton Express and Star reports that hundreds of people have seen strange objects in the sky during recent weeks. One of them, a young woman who remains anonymous, said she saw "a silvery, egg-shaped object hovering over the Black Country one night" this week. According to the witness, the object had no wings or other visible means of propulsion, and it moved quickly and silently before disappearing.

Another similar sighting was reported by a man who was looking towards the east when he saw a brightly lit object dropping slowly over some trees. He watched it for several minutes before it suddenly streaked away at tremendous speed.

The Walsall police also received numerous reports of strange objects being seen moving high above the town. The air raid sirens were even sounded at one stage, but no aircraft could be identified.

On Saturday night, residents of Wednesfield, near Wolverhampton, watched a large object hovering in the sky for about fifteen minutes. It was described as being "much larger than a star" and had a bright glow. Several people said the object appeared to be spinning, or oscillating, and they heard a faint humming noise.

Gloucester, England

Activity over Gloucester
The following information was reported to the investigation of UFOs where a report had appeared in the press, by Mr. and Mrs. Gavin, who live at 138 Broadway, Gloucester. They reported that at about 10:30 p.m. on the night of 15th August 1963, they, together with Mr. Gavin's brother and sister-in-law and Mrs. Gavin's parents, who were visiting them, all saw an unusual sight in the sky over Gloucester.
They stated that they first saw a cluster of bright objects moving straight across the sky. These were estimated to be about eight or ten lights, possibly more. They moved swiftly and silently, changing direction several times. They appeared to be at a fairly high altitude. After a few minutes, this cluster broke up and a series of individual lights, about six in number, were observed moving on a more erratic course. These appeared to be larger than the lights in the original group and were of a red or orange color. They also seemed to be at a lower altitude. Occasionally they would disappear from view and then reappear. This activity went on for about 20 minutes, after which the lights gradually faded from sight.
The witnesses stated that on more than one occasion, the lights formed a triangular or wedge-shaped pattern. Although the group was not photographed, it was reported that they decided to call the police, but by the time they had made the call, the activity had ceased.

AIRRON, OHIO 8/16-17/63  
11:52PM - Miss Becky Dozer and Bruce Doger, sister & brother, observed an object in the sky which was described as being as "large as a star" and changing color rapidly from green to violet to blue, to white, the occasional appearance of a reddish color was also seen. The object was tracked from the time it appeared at 11:52PM until it finally disap- peared about 2:30AM EDT. The color charges were rather rapid, continuing to cycle through their color spectrum. The object did not appear to be rotating, but re- ceiving colors upon it dynamically. The object appeared to be stabilize through its ac- tion, not drifting appreciably. No airplane or satellite identification could be made and the object appeared to many times the size of a star, yet it was difficult to judge its actual size and distance. The planets, Jupiter & Saturn, were pointed out to the observers but they stated the object did not resemble either of these in any way. The object appeared to move in the following manner: Dia- metrically to the observer's position, the object would grow larger, then smaller, then disappear and reappear in a slightly different position, continuously, be- coming a longer shape with each repetition. Additionally, an occasional brightening would occur. This rhythmic change in shape and color was continuous over the sighting period. 

The observer stated its distance was apparently about the size of a pencil held at arm's length.

Triangle In The Sky

On the night of 17 August 1963 at 7:30 p.m. (EDT) Mrs. Bradbery, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, reported seeing an unusual UFO in the sky overhead.

Viewed through binoculars from her home, the object appeared to be in the shape of a triangle with a red light emanating from each of the three corners. The object was still in approximately the same position of a few minutes when it began to move. At 7:45 p.m. the triangle was visible again but it had dimmed. The position had changed somewhat in regards to a reference point. The case is similar to a reference point in Baltimore, failed to turn up an explanation.

Unidentified Object Over Beltio

On the same night as the Bradbery sighting Mrs. George Spee of Baltimore observed an unidentified object high in the northeast portion of the city. She reported the object to WBAL investigators and viewed the object from Cheek window for three days. The object appeared to be triangular in shape and pointed earthward and the whole object was red in color. No similar balloons over Baltimore for three days.

Children Observe UAO
David and Michael Saunders of 17 Twin Pines Drive, looked up from their play around 8:00 one afternoon, and saw a moving object which they first thought was a helicopter. However, the object was peculiar and remained in sight over a period of 45 minutes, located in St. John Valley, and the account of the sighting was published in Madawaska, Maine.
The youngsters called their grandmother from the house, and by the time the women arrived, the object had disappeared. The children are David, age 11, and Michael, age 9. The investigator was a Sergeant from the Canadian Border Patrol, P.R. Kent.
At 3:30 P.M. on August 31, David and Michael observed a bright, metallic, round disc-shaped object moving slowly toward the north-west. It was estimated to be about 40 miles north of Cyr Mountain on the road from Alright Point to Soldier Pond, St. David. David watched the object move for about 15 minutes, during which time it moved from the vicinity of the Constellation Orion. This latter sighting could not have been viewed through binoculars nor did the boys have such equipment. After the boys saw the disc-shaped object leave, they observed it again for a few minutes until it disappeared.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
23 August, 1963
Langland, Wales

WALES: 
Bank manager's sighting

The revival of interest in flying saucers has caused the manager of a Welsh bank to report his experience. The witness, who is a bank manager, was walking home after closing the bank when he saw what appeared to be a bright light moving in the sky. He stared at it for a moment and it suddenly stopped. He then saw that the object was round and white, and it seemed to be about 2,000 and 3,000 feet in altitude. It remained stationary for about five minutes and then moved off at a tremendous speed. The witness called the police and reported what he had seen. The police contacted the local army authorities, but they could find no trace of any aircraft in the area at that time. The witness is quite confident of the reality of what he saw and the local police take his report seriously. The witness has no history of any imaginative tendencies and appears to be a completely reliable informant. His experience is one of the few well-authenticated cases involving a bank manager. Mrs. Evans, the manager's wife, also saw the object and she told the police that he reports that only too often strange things in the sky. One of the most perplexing aspects of this case is the apparent absence of aircraft in the area at the time, since the sighting took place near an airfield. However, there was nothing to suggest any hoax or hallucination, and the witness appeared to be thoroughly convinced of the reality of what he had seen.

26 August, 1963
Windermere, England

"Round with a flat top"
The account describes a sighting by David Anthony McCann, who lives in Windermere, England. On the evening of August 26, 1963, McCann saw an object that was "round with a flat top" and moving rapidly across the sky. The object was reportedly large, bright, and making a humming sound. McCann watched the object for a short period of time before it disappeared.
