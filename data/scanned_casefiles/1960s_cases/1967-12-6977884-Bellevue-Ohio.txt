COMMENTS: The observer uses the term "it" throughout his descriptions, yet in item #29 of 164 he states that there were 2 objects. Several witnesses were contacted, however only one answered. He stated that he saw only a red revolving light that was a little like an airplane. The Bellevue Police dept. was contacted and requested to supply information if they had received any similar reports on this night, however they failed to reply to the request.

LA MARANO'S DRAFT

1. The observer wrote that "at the corner, I turned north, as I turned I noticed that the sky was lit up to the N. W. I stopped and rolled down the window and looked up towards the sky. Then I saw the U. F. O." Yet in #21, of the green form 164, he indicated that the object was only 300 ft away.

2. If the object was far enough away to light up the sky in the northwest, it certainly wouldn't be as close as 300 ft. Also, since the car was headed north, the driver should have had excellent visibility toward the northwest from the drivers front window. If the observer did have to roll down his window so as to see the object, the object must have been nearly overhead. If the object was directly overhead, what was the source of the light that lit up the sky in the northwest and caused the observer to stop? If the object was bright enough to light up the sky while 300 ft over the observers car, why is it that no one else in the area seems to have seen it at this point? Especially since his friends were only about 1500 ft away ("about a quarter-mile away.")

3. "After telling the guys and pointing to the object, which now was a quarter-mile away. . ." This seriously conflicts with the statement of the only witness to return the forms that the object was four to eight miles away.

4. "Five in one car driven by [redacted], we started after the object," yet the observer lists only three witnesses.

The time was about 7:40, Thursday night. We were just getting off of High school instructions. I got in my car and was heading West, at the corner I turned North, as I turned I noticed that the sky was lit up to the northwest. I stopped and rolled down the window and looked up towards the sky. Then I saw the U.F.O...

It was round, and about fifty to seventy-five feet in diameter, and about ten to fifteen feet high, the bottom was curved, but as the bottom touched the sides. The sides were straight, but where the bottom touched the edges it was curved.

The edge was lit all the way around. The bottom had a doom shaped object which was also lit up in white light.

I turned around and started back to where I left the rest the rest of the guys where. During the time I started back and the time that I got there, (about one-quarter mile) the white lights had gone off and the red lights came on.

After telling the guys and pointing to the object, which now was at a distance of about a quarter-mile away, they jumped into their car. Five in the one car, driven by [redacted], we started after the object. We followed it west for about three miles, till it had gone our of sight.

It did not go up but straight ahead and out of sight. After we stopped at the sign, we could still see about five too ten miles ahead, we could tell that it stopped and came back a little bit, but turned and went on.


- page 17 -

The next day, another friend told me that at the same time that we headed west after that one, he was on his way home, and he saw one back behind our house. Then at the same time that we chased after the other one the one behind our house which seemed to be ready to land, then took off.

It seemed to me that these two were together, and that as the one was getting ready to settle down the other one was still searching to find a place to land.

Then the one that I saw may have seen that I saw him, and signaled to the other one that he was seen and that he was leaving. So the other one took off with it.

5. These three witnesses were each sent an AF Form 117 on 7 February 1968 but none of them completed and returned the form at th t time. All three were sent an AF Form 117 again, on 27 March 1968. One form was returned to the Aerial Phenomena Office as having been completed on 30 April 1968. In question #1, the date of the observation is given as 17 September 1967, to the left of this date is also the date of 7 December 1967. Also the witness in no way stated that the object "was saucer-shaped, that it had a revolving red light, that it was lighted all the way around, that the bottom was dome-shaped . . . ." as insinuated in Dr Hynek's letter but stated that he saw a red revolving light, "a little like an airplane" and that he saw the object only at a distance (4 to 8 miles as indicated in question #19). Other points of interest are the fact that no one else in the area reported any similiar sighting to us for that night. The police department did not feel it important enough to answer our letter and also the fact that the observer had a copy of the green 164 reporting form on hand (one that had been published in a leading magazine that had a special on flying saucers).

6. The duration, flight characteristics, the white light and flashing red light in no way conflict with the evaluation of aircraft. The craft did not perform any erratic motions impossible to an aircraft. In the words of the observer, "It did not go up but straight ahead out of sight."

7. I do not feel that the sighting represents any threat to the security of the United States; gives any evidence that the stimulus represented any extraterrestrial craft or presents an information of scientific value.

1. We have here another example in which the evaluation "possible aircraft" should be paired with "possible/identified". It is all a question of how far one can go in taking the boy's testimony more or less at face value. It is interesting that two independent witnesses were in good agreement on Item 13. Both said the object appeared to stand still at some time, both said that it suddenly sped up and rushed away, both said that it changed brightness, both said that it flashed and flickered, and both said that it lasted 10 to 15 minutes. If we take their composite testimony, then the aircraft explanation is untenable. It can be adopted only if we severely discount their statements that it was saucer-shaped, that it had a red revolving light, that the edge of it was lighted all the way around, that the bottom was dome-shaped, and was also lighted up with a white light, yet there was no sound, and that the relative dimensions did not match that of an airplane.

2. I don't know where Bellevue, Ohio, is but I would suggest that the next time I am in Dayton I make a point of interrogating these witnesses, even if only by phone. I think particularly on the length of time it supposedly stood still. I believe this is a crucial point and if we can establish that its standing still was the result of radial motion, that's one thing. But if it stood still for five minutes, then we have another situation. So then, both evaluations, possibly aircraft, possibly unidentified, would apply for the moment until further interrogation.

4. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
