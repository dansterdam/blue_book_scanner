A strange object passing overhead, moving at an extremely rapid rate, turning sharply at one point, changing color from white to red, then out of sight. This was seen at night from my backyard. The object was in sight for only a few seconds and seemed to be at a fairly high altitude. A sight that I was quite startled by and one which I can't fully explain.

Dear Major Hart:

On the morning of July 13 at approximately 2:30 E.D.T. I saw an unidentified flying object. This object was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. While still traveling east it seemed to lose altitude and slowed down. Then it was disappearing behind some trees a few blocks from my house. This may sound a little crazy, but I believe it included a night following it. I thought I heard a faint buzzing sound but it might have been my radio because at that time some static-like interference came on it. I am sure the static on the radio was from the U.F.O. because it was only there while this object was in sight. If you would let me know if you get any other reports of this?

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but does not contain any photographic images. 

Text from the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound
b. Color

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
                 b. Like a bright star
                 c. Sharply outlined
                 d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, with questions for the observer to answer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image appears to contain no photograph, but rather diagrams and sketches. There are two main sketches on the page.

The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B". The sketch depicts the trajectory of an object as observed above the horizon.

The second sketch shows a road leading to a distant landscape, with a person standing in the foreground. There is also a smaller circular inset sketch showing a landscape with a curved horizon line.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
