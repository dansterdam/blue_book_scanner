Dear Major Harp;

On the morning of July 13 at approximately 2:30 E.D.T. I saw an Unidentified Flying Object. It was heading in an easterly direction. When I first saw it, directly overhead, it was travelling at an immense rate of speed. While still traveling east it seemed to lose altitude and glow bright. The last I saw of it, it was disappearing behind some trees a few blocks from my house. This may sound a little crazy, but I believe it landed.

The thing was oval shaped and glowed a yellowish-white. I thought I heard a faint buzzing sound, but it might have been my radio because at that time some static-like interference came on it. I am sure that on the radio was from the U.F.O. because it was only there while the 'thing' was in sight.

I would appreciate it very much if you would let me know if you get any other reports of this.

                                                                        Sincerely,
