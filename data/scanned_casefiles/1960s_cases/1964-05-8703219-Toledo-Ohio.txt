Initial impression was that the obj was a star. Fixation of observation could create illusion of motion since no ready reference to this body would be nearby. Capella in NW at 20 deg elevation.

Dear Sirs,

On the fifth of May nineteen hundred sixty-four, I was out on the back step looking up at a star or what I thought to be a star when suddenly this object went straight up in the air for about sixty seconds then straight down again. It was in a North Westerly direction at 45Â°. At first the object was white, then red, then reddrange. It continued this motion for about 5 min. then disappeared.

I decided to wait a few days to make sure this wasn't a star. It never returned.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. It was between 9:45 PM to 9:30 P.M.

Have a way of knowing whether he is a true or fictional character in this movie. I would appreciate it very much if I could interview him.

Thank you,

Dear Sirs,

Could you give me any kind of information on "Flying Saucers" (U.F.O.). I am 17 years of age and I am interested on writing a book about them. The title is: Unidentified Flying Objects (U.F.O.)

I recently saw a movie on T.V. titled "Unidentified Flying Objects". It had two films taken of Flying Saucers flying over parts of the United States. Since then I have become deeply interested in U.F.O.s Is there any way that I might be able to get a hold of this movie?

There is one thing that I am curious about and that is "PROJECT BLUE BOOK". Could you give me any information on this and what it is about. I would appreciate it very much. If there is any possible way that you could send me books, articles from magazines, newspapers clippings and so forth I will be pleased.
