b. At 1930 hours, 18 December 1960, I spotted the UFO. I called MSG Weather Station and they also noticed it. I called the Base Weather Station and they also noticed it. The UFO seen tonight was similar to the above report. I noticed it for 15 minutes.

c. Special Visual Aid: I looked at the UFO with a telescope (approximately 30 power) and it appeared as a very bright star with a motion like the letter Z. It had a color similar to a diamond when moved in the sunlight. It could also be compared with a Christmas sparkler when waved back and forth.

d. Consolidated Reports: Judging from the information gathered, the UFO's seen on the 16, 17 and 18 December could be considered as one report with the exception of the time and dates.
