Two Rivers, NJ, Moorestown, NJ - Two officers, while standing on an dustry at the local airport, reported William D. Neva and this object moved past a blimp and made about directly, overhead. The UFO appeared to be a round, flat object.

The text on the page is partially legible. Here is what I can make out:

"... overnight Correct

... appeared to kill or is staged
..."

The rest of the text is too blurry or obscured to read with certainty. The document appears to be a scanned page from an old report, with the text fragment located in the center of an otherwise blank white page.

Here is the text I can read from the image:

"...gabled an elongated UFO. The 16mm

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for August 26, 1961

ASTRONOMY

Jupiter Dazzles the Eye

Jupiter is nearly 20 times as bright as a first magnitude star in September. Seen in Sagittarius, the archer, it stands in the south next to Saturn, James Stokley reports.

> ONCE AGAIN we have two bright planets in the evening sky.

This month Jupiter is shining nearly 20 times as bright as a typical first magnitude star. It is conspicuous in the south in the constellation of Sagittarius, the archer. No star, and no other planet seen at the same time, is as easy to identify. Saturn is a third bright object, and in the same constellation. It is considerably fainter, although equal to a bright star of the first magnitude.

Both of these planets, as well as the moon, are shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the skies as they look about one hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise (add one hour for daylight saving time) on Sept. 1. They appear in the evening sky in the west, and in the morning sky at the middle of the evening's end.

Seen high in the west, it is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre. Still higher, almost directly overhead, is Deneb in the constellation Cygnus. Part of this group is the bright star Altair (with Deneb) on the southern. And high in the south, in Aquila, the eagle, is the star called Altair.

Deneb, Altair and Vega are all of the first magnitude stars. At their brightest, in their light is considerably dimmed by the greater thickness of atmosphere it has to penetrate.

Capella Stands Low in Northeast

Low in the northeast is Capella, in Auriga, the charioteer. This will move into a more prominent position in the evening sky during the autumn. Arcturus, in Bootes, the herdsman, is low in the northwest. During the last spring and summer it was the brightest star in the evening sky, and now it is about to disappear from view.

And low in the south in Pisci-Austrinnus, the southern fish, is Fomalhaut, now at about its best position for our latitude, and as high as it ever comes for us. From more southern countries it rises higher. At Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, it passes directly overhead.

In the eastern sky you will find Pegasus, the winged horse, and the great square, the rather prominent figure. Even though the square is not quite as bright as the summer square, whose regular shape makes it easy to locate. Actually, the northernmost star called Alpheratz, is not in Pegasus at all. It is in the next door constellation of Andromeda, which represents the mythological princess who was chained to the rock.

(The document also includes two star charts with constellation maps and a legend for star brightness symbols)

Here is the OCR text from the document:

to make them visible without a telescope,
were very not so close to the bright planet
with its overpowering glare.

Because of its rapid revolution,
changes position rapidly with regard to
Jupiter, and Europa a little more slowly.
Ganymede and Callisto, for several nights
at a time, may be seen on the same side of
the planet. Callisto will be to the west from
Sept. 3 to 10, and from Sept. 19 to 27. It
will be toward the east for the rest of the
month. Ganymede will be to the west about
Sept. 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29; and to the east
around Sept. 4, 11, 19 and 26.

In the case of Io, the amateur may
find, at Galileo did, that sometimes only
three, two or even one is visible. Some-
times they are eclipsed. These moons, like
our moon, shine by reflected sunlight, so
when they pass into Jupiter's shadow they
disappear. Also, they may be occluded when
one goes behind Jupiter. Sometimes, when a
moon passes in front of the planet. Then
also, it is invisible except with a good-
sized telescope. And sometimes with a
telescope, one can see the shadow of a
satellite moving across the planet's disk.
Ganymede and Callisto are the largest of
the satellites, each about 3,200 miles in
diameter, so they are considerably bigger
than our moon, with 2,160 miles. Io, with a
diameter of 2,300 miles, is somewhat larger
than the moon. Europa, with 2,000 miles,
is a little smaller.

                                                    Duluth, Chicago, Ft Wayne

30 October 1961

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Your recent letter to the Department of Defense has been referred to the Air Force.

The unidentified flying object report you queried about is not known to the Air Force. As far as we can determine, no sightings in that area and at that time have been reported.

I have enclosed several questionnaires which we would appreciate your completing if you witnessed the object in question. The other copies of the questionnaires are for other witnesses, if any. If you should have any newspaper clippings pertaining to this event, it would be appreciated if you could forward one or two to us.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
