July 8, 1962

Dear Sir:

On the morning of July 8th, at the geographic position Lat. 16°.50'N, Long. 88°.20'W, at about 10:30 a.m. local time, I observed a strange object in the sky. Briefly, it was disc-shaped, metallic in appearance, and seemed to hover silently for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing.

[The rest of the text is partially illegible due to the image quality, but appears to be a continuation of the witness's description of the UFO sighting.]

The bottom of the document has a black line redacting what appears to be a signature.
