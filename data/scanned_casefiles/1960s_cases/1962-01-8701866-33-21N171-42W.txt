10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
At 06-05-12Z, 150° azimuth, 15° elev, 150° azimuth after 4 min observation. Sighted thru overcast. Object was point source of light, no known size in area.

11. COMMENTS
Echo thru 33°N, 170°W at 06/0512Z. At 0512z Echo would have been above 47.5°N and at a longitude of approx 20°. Echo ruled out. However the object was probably one of the other satellites visible thru a sextant. Orbital flight and duration are consistent with this conclusion. 1961 Epsilon 1. Data in lambda 122 have inclinations greater than 80° and perigee below 300 miles. Would appear to be manmade.
