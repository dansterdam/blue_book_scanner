COMMENTS: Observer stated that a helicopter would look similar to the object. Wright-Patterson AFB located near Dayton and usually has numerous aircraft departing, and on approach. The witness was sent a 117 but failed to return it. There is nothing to indicate that the object could not have been an aircraft. There is not real data on second sighting because it is similar to first. But too may have been an aircraft.

May 5th. Do not know how long the object was in the sky when it first noticed it. It might have been 5 to 10 minutes, but was sighted the sky was overcast, and lights rain was falling. The object was very dim at first, then rapidly grew as bright to a ball of fire. At went downstairs to close windows, went back upstairs to look at the object, and it had disappeared. I looked all over the sky and saw it nowhere. It had disappeared in a matter of 3 to 5 minutes.

1966. The mid-summer of 1966 my husband and I saw a very fast moving object high in the sky. Approx. 80Â° up. This object looked like a star. Suddenly it stopped, started up very fast, then disappeared; reappeared some distance away. An airplane flew by (the plane was also up very high), then the object reappeared and moving very slow it began to trail the airplane. My husband saw a similar incident around the month of October of the same year.
