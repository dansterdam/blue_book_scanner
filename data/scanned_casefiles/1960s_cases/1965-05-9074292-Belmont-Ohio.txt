Here is the OCR text from the document:

ACL 1935 Sometime in the early solid
read that she was in or on object
flying (stationary) in the air. She
said it appeared to be shining
with pale, hued square edges, shaped
like a heart, and had strings
running up to it, so approximately
something would go up it seems
reached the object. Outside
questioning the lady and filling out
FTD form 164, she was laughing and
continued to insist that during my
and look away at the object
out, identify her
air. At this point
I appeared that she was playing prank
