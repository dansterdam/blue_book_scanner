This is it......
Dedicated to the survivors of the "Deep Deep".
This is the story as my husband and myself know it and observed together. 
Both objects were very clear and very, very low. The only difference in our opinions due to perspective is that my husband thought the object was much larger than the airplane and I saw it as smaller, about 2/4 the size of the plane. There was a terrific noise, but only one motor noise from the airplane, as a very low flying airplane would emit. The airplane was an older type plane and as Mr. Nelson said much like an older C-47. (Newspaper said B-49)
It was OD color, illuminated by the lights of the other object, they were so close to each other we thought they were going to crash, we did hear metallic clanging together but whiter it was this object we do not know.  Neither object was jet propelled, they both flew as a low flying, slow flying airplane would fly. the airplane was like an old world war II bomber with big motors, a very heavy built airplane, not jet or streamlined such as our boeing models are.
The objectwas shaped round on the base, at least it appeared to be because of the lights, it had a beautiftjij silvery dome, so one man described, "almost like glass", it had huge lights, on the front green, on the back red and on the dome amber. It was beautiful and we will not say it was from outer space, it could have been made by us. It was rare and unusual but not impossible.  After this object disappeared from our view, two fast flying airplanes within minutes apart and low, flew in the same direction. There seemed to be many airplanes in the area afterwards and we are convinced that this airplane was so close to the object that they had to see it and what was in it, if there was, they just had to.
Afterwards, we heard a loud crashing noise and observed glowing light coming from the direction of the lake, which is one half mile from our home, this was very eerie, but could have been anything. It is this lake scene in which most people have observed these objects. The following night two of these objects appeared.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed letter or report discussing observations of strange lights in the sky, which the author describes as "frightening the people and causing mass concern". The author notes that these objects have been reported by multiple people in the area, and expresses hope that there may be some logical explanation for these sightings.

Here is the text from the document:

Please continue to try to observe this once again
We are hoping for a solution and only can say: "We have seen it, we believe it" whatever it is
We are hoping for a solution and say that we may get to observe this once again

Sincerely

Renton, Washington

Dear Girl,

We received your reply and information and we were very glad to hear from you.
In haste we lost your letter but will try to answer it the best we can.
It has been such a summer that you nor anyone else would find it easy to believe and so we hesitate to discuss this summer with a lot of people. Things happened that were witnessed by several people almost every evening and it could almost be impossible to go into minute detail of dates etc. It would have taken a catalogues to keep the records and we finally gave up. We are considering, taping the information from various witness's to this phenomenal summer and then typing up a complete report. We are waiting for a tape recorder. We don't even know who would be interested in this besides ourselves but I can tell you that so person we talked to or were acquainted with could tell us many fantastic lies as it would seem to discuss these things.
First we observed our own incident and then each night we would watch moving lights across the sky from our own roof top. Perhaps a few of these were satellites but when you count up to 12 and 15 within the time span of 2 hours it seems ridiculous to suggest that these were all satellites and were redeculose to suggest these were airplanes when there was no sound involved and since we have observed that we can hear any airplane that we can see from our positions. Well what were they? Airplanes? We observed two radiant round balls flying very very low, east, south from our home extremely brilliant and so low you could actually see moving machinery within the brilliant light, it gave the illusion of being perfectly round. We saw one that tumbled barely higher than the airplane so glistening several colored lights appeared motionless. Apparently the pilot of the airplane did not get excited because he kept steady on his course. I can't remember whether we told you about the fantastic incident of the mountain jeep trip we took. It was hilarious and frightening at the same time and I will try to report it to you.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page of text from a report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"to tell you exactly what happened. My brother became interested in these crazy things and the crazier notions that have a building place. And we spent several evenings with him chasing these things in his Jeep, since and because of the strain of these wilderness trips the Jeep has lost an axle and?buff of use. But one evening we decided to find a road to the top of the highest mountain peak so that we could watch for lights. We finally arrived at a forest service station, and from there we could see a higher peak and on the tip top we could see what looked like domes and antennae's and we decided to adventure and see what we could see. We followed a road, one way width, very rutty and wet and hard to get through, but we finally made it and found none of this property was government posted nor were there any fences or keep out signs so gates we nothing. This top of this road was at approx. an 20 degree single up. My brother parked the Jeep about half way up because we were afraid that we could not turn around to come back down. The three men got out and with a small flashlight they walked up the hill. A few minutes passed and finally we saw all three of them running like son of a gun down the hill toward us. Now we thought they were being silly and trying to scare us four women in the car and we were getting a big kick out of it until they got in the Jeep and whatsoffed they were not saying a word they just hustled that Jeep out of there and away we went. Finally they calmed down and told us their story. They had arrived at the dome shaped structures and as they were flashing their light around they heard a crazy voice, as if it were on a record player on a very fast speed say "Can't talk now, someone's coming" and then they heard a glass click click, click, as if switches were being snapped off. Well it scared the heck out of them and that is when they started running. Mind you by this time it was pitch black out and they could see nor hear no one or no thing."

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

The next day we started out earlier and decided that we going to return there and see what we could see in the daylight. It took us two hours from the bottom of the hill to get to the top of the hill in broad day light. We saw this

there was no sign of life. there were no fuses in the fuse box there was no machinery in operation. There were no signs. inside one of the domes there was a typewritten sign that said this property stolen from somebodys garage in snohomish. It wasnt scary in the day light and looked as if it were a tv relay station or something. I called every one that we could think of that would verify that there was something there and no one would admit to it. One engineer asked me what time of day it was and I told him it was 10:30 at night. He said "are you crazy" and hung up. Well you can see why we were and are afraid to mention to many of these things to the wrong people. Ok You tell us what it was and what it is and we will be satisfied that we are a bunch of nuts that are looking for some excitement (to fill up the emptiness of our lives) that has been suggested by people that cannot take the time to look, listen, or hear.

The next interesting thing that I can think of was "The star that stood still". My nephew, my self a 20 year old neighbor girl and our daughter were sitting on the roof watching the skies we watched this brilliant star for at least 2 and a half hours. when much to our surprise and fright before our eyes it began to fly away. It traveled east toward the peak of the mountains that we can see from our roof. It appeared to fly around the mountain at least it would disappear and reappear at various points along the peak of the mountains.

BEEP-BEEP-BEEP
Lights, Sounds, Actions-U.F.O.'s Turn Terrifying
By DON DUNCAN
Insistent, spooky.
Residents adjacent to a small wooded area near Lake McDonald, they say, heard the sound last night. It has been going on for several weeks at least, they say.
"Besides the beep-beep-beep, there were flashing red and green lights across the field and through the trees," said one couple who live in the area. "It sounded like a fireball that would cross the field to about 100 yards of our porch the James Nelson home, 1612 8th AV. S.W."
SKY WATCHERS said the object was picked up by airplane radar. But the lunighted obj ect was hardly compared with a shooting star and then seen in 17 seconds.
Kay Similiard, 20, said she saw the object five nights ago. She said it was in the sky. 
"But it was the Sundaynight experience that brought neighbors to their porch last night. They would talk of it- nothing else.
The beep-beep-beep had continued to about midnight. Neighborhood dogs began to howl incessantly.
MRS. NELSON went to her window and opened it.
U Gets Loan To Develop Parking Sites
WASHINGTON, April 19.
The U.S. government has authorized a $1 million loan to help develop parking sites in urban areas, officials said today.
The loan will be made to small businesses seeking to provide parking facilities in congested downtown areas and near public transportation terminals, a spokesman for the Small Business Administration said.

The spokesman said the authority for the loan comes under the urban renewal program of the Housing and Home Finance Agency.

He said the loan can be used to finance the acquisition and improvement of land for parking lots and structures, and the construction of parking facilities.

The spokesman said the loan would be made at the prevailing interest rate, which is now 5 3/4 per cent.

Then she heard another sound - "like iron clinkins and wood breaking." Then she saw an airplane.
"It looked like it was maneuvering end over end," she said.
"Then," she continued, "I saw some other strange lights through the trees. They seemed to be moving among the trees, before they blotted out the airplane. It broke into view. It was not the airplane."
They watched the strange object. From a distance the object wavered and seemed to be surrounded by a basketball-sized bluish glow. Then it shot up and put a basketball in the air.
WILSON, A BOEING Co. official, whose wife said he added his own thought that the airplane might be "flying wings" and it seemed to be fighting with the distant object, declared: "It looked that way, but just as they were about to collide the airplane was pulled away."
"The Nelsons," said they watched the strange object in the sky for about 15 minutes. Its lights pulsating. Then two jets went over. The Nelsons said "it appeared to them to follow it, 'as if they were following it.'"
All that remained was the woods and that persistent beep-beep-beep.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. ********,

Reference your unidentified observation of 13 April 1966. The information which we have received is not sufficient for a scientific evaluation. Request you complete the attached BLUE forms 14 and return them in the envelope provided.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Major, USAF

Dear sirs, 
there are so many things to tell about our incident and it is possibly more than i could write in detail. Many things are not clear and so many mystery and unanwered questions. It would take me days and days to explain all the details. I can't reveal many things here as they are. 

I believe if you'd like to know the results, i can further discuss - but extreme caution must be excercised, as the subject is rather sensitive.
