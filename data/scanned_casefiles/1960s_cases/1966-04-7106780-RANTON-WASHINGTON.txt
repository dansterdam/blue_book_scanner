FTD Form 164 forwarded to witnesses, however, not returned after 30 days. Will re-evaluate if forms are received.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Obj was metallic in color about the size of a silver dollar. There was a red light in front and a green one in side, rotating. There appeared to be a dome on top with a salmon colored light on the top of the dome. Obj appeared on or side of an aircraft, they were watching. Moved slowly to a possible aircraft, however, additional info is needed.

This is it......
Dedicated to the survivors of the "Beep Beep".

This is the story as my husband and myself know it and observed together.
Both objects were very clear and very, very low. The only difference in our opinions due to perspective is that my husband thought the object was much larger than the airplane and I saw it as smaller, about 3/4 the size of the plane. There was a terrific noise, but only one motor noise from the airplane, as a very low flying airplane would emit. The airplane was an older type plane and as Mr. Nelson said much like an older C-47. (newspaper said B-49)

It was OD color, illuminated by the lights of the other object, they were so close to each other we thought they were going to crash, we did hear metal clanging together but whether it was this sight or not we do not know. Neither object was jet propelled, they both flew as a low flying, slow flying airplane would fly, the airplane was like an old world war II bomber with big motors, a very heavy built airplane, not jet or streamlined such as our boeing models are.

The object was shaped round on the base, at least it appeared to be because of the lights, it had a beautiful silvery dome, much like the diamond in a ring, not a dark silver, as one man described, "almost like glass". It had huge lights, on the front green, on the back red and on the dome amber. It was beautiful and we will not say it was from outer space, it could have been made by us. It was rare and unusual but not impossible. After this object disappeared from our view, two fast flying airplanes within minutes apart and low, flew in the same direction. There seemed to be many airplanes in the area afterwards and we are convinced that this airplane was so close to the object that they had to see it and what was in it, if there was, they just had to.

Afterwards, we heard a loud crashing noise andobserved glowing light coming from the direction of the lake, which is one half mile from our home, this was very eerie, but could have been anything. It is this lake area in which most people have observed these objects. The following night two of these objects


- page 3 -

were observed by my daughter and myself at a much greater distance but recognized
by the strange and tremendous lights .
These objects have been reported at least once a night by somebody within this
mile and a half area until the weather turned cloudy and rainy last Tuesday
The objects are frightening the people and causing mass concern and the
children are becoming hysterical because of the sights and the movies of the
monsters from outer space.
We know there must be some logical answers to this and are hoping that we can
be put at ease . We can only say, "We have seen it, we believe it" whatever
it is
We are hoping for a solution and also that we may get to observe this once
again

Sincerely

Renton, Washington

Dear Sir:

We received your reply and information and we were very glad to hear from you.

In haste we lost your letter but will try to answer the best we can.

It has been such a summer that you nor anyone else would find it easy to believe and so we hesitate to discuss this summer with a lot of people. Things happened and were witnessed by several people almost every evening and it could almost be impossible to go into minute detail of dates etc. it would have taken a catalogue to keep the records and we finally gave up. we are considering, then taping the information from various witnesses to this phenomenal summer and then typing up a complete report. we are waiting for a tape recorder. we don't even know who would be interested in this besides ourselves but I can tell you that no person we talked to or were grouped with could tell as many fantastic lies as it would take to discuss these things.

First we observed our own incident and then each night we would watch moving lights across the sky from our own roof tops. Perhaps a few of these were satilights but when you count up to 12 and 15 within the time span of 2 hours it seems ridiculous to suggest that these were all satilights and more ridiculous to suggest these were airplanes when there was no sound involved and since we have observed that we can hear any airplane that we can see from our positions. all what were they? Airplanes? we observed two radiant round balls flying very very low, east, south from our home extremely brilliant and so low you could actually see moving machinery within the brilliant light, it gave the illusion of being perfectly round. we saw one that tumbled barely higher then an airplane flashing several colored lights. apparently the pilot of tehe airplane did not get excited because he kept steady on his course. I can't remember whether we told you about the fantastic incident of the mountain jepp trip we took. It was hilarious and frightening at the same time and I will try


- page 5 -

to tell you exactly what happened. My brother became interested in these crazy lights and the crazier notions that were taking place. and we spent several evenings with him chasing these things in his Jeep, since and because of the strain of these wilderness trips the Jeep has lost an axel and out of use. But one evening we decided to find a road to the top of the highest mountain peak so that we could watch for lights. We finally arrived at a forest rangers station. and from there we could see a higher peak and on the tip top we could see what looked like domes and antenna's and we decided to adventure and see what we could see. We followed a road, one way width, very rutty and wet and hard to get through, but we finally made it kind you none of this property was government posted nor were there any fences no keep out signs no gates no nothing. The top of this road was at approx. an 80 degree angle straight up. My brother parked the Jeep about half way up because we were afraid that we could not turn around to come back down. The three men got out and with a small flashlight they walked up the hill, a few minutes passed and finally we saw all three of them running like son of a guns down the hill toward us. Now we thought they were being silly and trying to scare us four women in the car and we were getting a big kick out of it until they got in the Jeep and whitefaced they were not saying a word they just hustled that jeep out of there and away we went. Finally they calmed down and told us their story. They had arrived at the dome shaped structures and as they were flashing their light around they heard a crazy voice, as if it were on a record player on a very fast speed say "Can't talk now someone's coming" and then they heard a Click Click Click.. as if switches were being snapped off. Well it scared the heck out of them and that is when they started running Kind you by this time it was pitch black out and they could see nor hear no one or no thing.


- page 6 -

The next day we started out earlier and decided that we going to return there and see what we could see in the daylight. It took us two hours from the bottom of the hill to get to the top of the hill in broad day light. We saw this

there was no sign of life. there were no fuses in the fuse box there was no machinery in operation. There were no signs. Inside of one of the does there was a handwritten sign that said this property stolen from somebodys garage in Snohomish. It wasn't scary in the day light and looked as if it were a t v relay station or something. I called every one that we could think of that could verify that there was something there and no one would admit to it. One engineer asked me what time of day it was and I told him it was 10;30 at night. He said are you crazy and hung up. Well you can see why we were and are afraid to mention to many of these things to the wrong people. Ok You tell us what it was and what it is and we will be satisfied that we are a bunch of nuts that were looking for some excitement (to fill up the emptiness of our lives) that has been suggested by people that cannot take the time to look, listen, or hear.

The next interesting thing that I can think of was "The star that stood still". My nephew, my self a 20 year old neighbor girl and our daughter were sitting on the roof scanning the skies we watched this brilliant star for at least 2 and half hours when much to our surprise and right before our eyes it began to fly away. It traveled east toward the peaks of the mountains that we can see from our roof. It appeared to fly around the mountain at least it would disappear and reappear at various

BEEP-BEEP-BEEP
Lights, Sounds, Actions—U. F. O.'s Turn Terrifying
By DON DUNCAN

Beep-beep-beep. Insistent. Spooky.
Residents adjacent to a small wooded area near Lake McDonald, six miles east of Renton, heard the sound last night. It has been going on for several weeks, they say.

A new dimension was added several weeks ago. Besides the beep-beep-beep, there were flying objects. Last night there was a red fireball that "like an iron clinching" swooshed, like iron clinching and wood breaking." Then she saw an airplane.

"And then," Mrs. Nelson continued, "I saw some other lights through the trees, moving. I thought it was the airplane. It broke into view.

It was not the airplane. I called my husband.

"We stood and watched the strange and this object. From a distance the object dwarfed the airplane, as if you had put a basketball beside an orange."

NELSON, A Boeing Co. machinist, verified what his wife had said, but added his own thought that the airplane was "an old B-49 (a North top "flying wing") and it seemed to be fighting with the strange object—at least it looked that way, but just as they were about to collide, the airplane banked and pulled away."

The Nelsons said they watched the object hang in the sky for about 15 minutes, its lights pulsating. Then two more airplanes approached it, "as if they were following it."

And then it was gone. And all that remained was the woods and that persistent beep-beep-beep.

SKY WATCHERS said the fireball was described by the drone of an airplane engine. But the luminous red light, distant and fleeting, barely compared with other sightings seen and heard in recent weeks.

Kay Kemillard, 20, said she saw four strange, glowing objects in the sky. And a 13-year-old girl reported seeing two objects in the sky. Both were badly frightened.

But it was the Sunday night experience of the Nelsons that brought neighbors to their porch last night. They could talk of it.

The beep-beep-beep had picked up in speed and volume around midnight Sunday. Neighborhood dogs began to howl mournfully and to bark.

MRS. NELSON went to her window and opened it.

Dear Sirs,

There Are so Many "Things" to Tell About our "UFO Summer" we Barely Noticed into Detail. There Are Many Witnesses of Other Sightings AND so Many Mysterious Things Seen in This Area, in Woods AND Elsewhere. It Would Take me Days and Days to Apply Things to You We Like.

You Would Also Think We Were A Bunch of Nuts if You Listened to the Reports. I Can Assure You We Are Most Sincere with Each Happening & Try to Detail Exactly. I Have Written Several Possibilities that Without My Explanation.

We Have Learned the Hard Way
