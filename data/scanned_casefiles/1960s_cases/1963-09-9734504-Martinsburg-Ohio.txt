The image appears to be a handwritten document, but it does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

Sight and identification were made very clearly and distinctly while observing object. Object was moving at a very fast rate of speed, estimated to be well over 1000 mph. Object appeared to be cigar-shaped, blue-green in color, and was emitting a bright, continuous glow. When the object was directly overhead, it appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in length. The object was only observed for a very brief period of time, approximately 10 to 15 seconds, before it suddenly disappeared from sight, appearing to fade away rather than accelerate out of sight. No sound was heard at any time during the observation. The weather was clear, with no cloud cover, and visibility was excellent. There was no moon, and the object was observed against a background of stars. The observer was an experienced private pilot, and he stated that this was the most unusual and unexplainable object he had ever observed. The observer's name and address have been withheld at his request.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter dated October 14, 1963 from Major USAF Mason M. Jacks, Public Information Division, Office of Information, regarding a reported sighting of unidentified objects during the early morning hours of September 21, 1963 near Martinsburg, Ohio. The letter describes the details of the incident and thanks the recipient for reporting it.

October 14, 1963

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your letter of September 24, 1963 reporting sighting unidentified objects during the early morning of the 21st.

When the report was received, it was immediately forwarded to the proper Air Force agencies for analysis. Mission which might have been conducted in that general area at that time could not be confirmed with the information provided. The witnesses states that the objects appeared to be metallic and capable of performing acrobatic maneuvers which could not be accomplished by any known conventional aircraft.

Since there are no many solventris and technical considerations involved in each sighting, thorough visual and technical examinations are conducted on each incident. This is done as part of the Air Force program to identify the cause of such phenomena.

Thank you for reporting this incident to the Air Force. We are sorry we are unable to advise you further as to the source of the lights.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS 
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Martinsburg, Ohio
