Gentlemen:

I sighted strange aircraft that flickered and dimmed now to Martinsburg, O., at about 11:00 p.m. today and didn't think much of reporting it locally at or near Civil Defense since I heard no motor noise he reported.

Dogs were barking about that time and I might have missed slightly, however, if might make some more it made very little.

Do you ever have any interference from the ground or in the way of electronics, microwave, or noise and voices amplified?

Do you still need ground observing and reporting or electronics and radar tracking?

I reported seeing it to President Kennedy and Civil Defense in Washington, D.C.

October 14, 1963

Dear Mrs.

This is in reply to your letter of September 24, 1963, in which you reported sighting unidentified objects during the early morning of the 24th.

What you may have seen was an air refueling mission which might have been taking place at that time. The aircraft may have been low high for the noise of their engines to be heard.

Since there are so many scientific and technical instruments scanning the skies each night, visual observations are of little value to the Air Force in its investigation of unusual aerial phenomena.

Thank you for reporting this incident to the Air Force. We are sorry we are unable to advise you further as to the source of the lights.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

Martinsburg, Ohio
