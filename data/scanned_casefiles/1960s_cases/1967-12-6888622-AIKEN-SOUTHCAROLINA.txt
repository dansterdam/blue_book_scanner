COMMENTS: The observer was twice requested to complete an AF Form 117 and also submit his photographs. He has not submitted either as of 6 September 1963. Several local officers reportedly saw the object, however, only one responded to our request to complete an AF Form 117. The information on the 117 is basically the same as given in the original TWX, except the officer stated that he saw the light in the vicinity for an hour. It is possible that several hot air balloons were the stimulus, however, with the information available it is impossible to determine if one object was observed continuously for an hour, or if there were several objects in the area during the time span.

Aiken, South Carolina 29801

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 29 December 1967. We apologize for the lengthy delay in contacting you relative to your observation. Due to a heavy backlog of work and an error in the filing of your report we were unable to initiate an investigation as promptly as we would have liked. Since we last requested that you submit your film, we have succeeded in locating several other witnesses to the sighting. However, we do need your films and a completed AF Form 117.

2. We realize that at this late date, you will not be able to answer the technical questions as well as you could have done at the time of the observation, although a statement on your sighting, in your own words would be appreciated. By using the camera data and the film, we may be able to determine the size of and speed of the object.

3. Thank you for your assistance in providing additional information. In the event you have misplaced your forms an additional set is enclosed.

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

In reference to your letter of May 9, 1968 concerning the U.F.O. I did see this round red or orange object in the sky behind the Crosland Park Area on that date (12/29/67 10:00 P.M. to 11:30 P.M.)

Officer D. T. Marchant and myself tried to catch the object but when we got close to it, it went away. It looked as if it went straight up, no noise.

Yours truly,
