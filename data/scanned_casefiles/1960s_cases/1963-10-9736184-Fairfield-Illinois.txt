PRELIMINARY REPORT ON DR. HENEK'S OBJECT

The following remarks are based on conversations with members of the Geology Department. Greater detail would require removal of a portion of the object for microscopic study.

This is a clay-ironstone concretion, with an outer rim of marcasite (FeS2) and an interior probably of argillaceous siderite (FeCO3). This concretion probably split along the original bedding of the host rock.

It is definitely a terrestrial object. Concretions of this sort are common in the Pennsylvanian strata of Illinois.

October 29, 63.

Dear Sirs,

A.F.O.

came in at 1.20 m -125 am while waiting for garage door to open. I looked at my watch, as I was driving home while out.

I had my radio on Armstrong and quite buzzy. As I also noticed blue flashes in sky over Morse Isle way lower and of Detroit river.

saw moon clear, but some clouds around.

also noticed two white clouds. one at 10 o'clock other at 4

THEN I SAW A BURST OF BLUE WITH FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT AT ABOUT 5 o'clock WITH FLASHES TRAVELING OUT IN A LINE THRU 11-5

I was looking out my right side driver's window.

This lasted less than one min.

It was size of moon in one big splash, b then the other spread it flashes they looked light tracer bullet then blue went up in sky.

Nothing then. just a noon in the sky.

I.   PURPOSE

To conduct spectographic and X-ray diffraction analyses to determine the chemical composition of: (1) Half of round object and, (2) A crystalline compound.

II.  FACTUAL DATA

1. The crystalline compound and the round object were submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch Nos. 3-1759 and 3-1807, respectively.

2. X-ray diffraction identified the crystalline compound as sodium chloride.

3. A sample was taken from the three different areas of the round object shown in the attached photographs, and emission and X-ray spectroscopy. The results are as follows:

A. Emission Analysis:                   Estimated Percentage

B. X-ray Diffraction Analysis:

X-ray diffraction patterns identified the two outside layers as Iron Pyrite and the inner layer as Calcium Carbonate mixed with about two per cent Iron.

III. CONCLUSION
None.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

Dear [redacted]:

of the 1405th Air Base Wing, Scott Air Force Base, has turned over to my office an object which was found by you at Ridgeway Cemetery. I wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Air Force, to thank you for your cooperation.

The object was turned over to us in two pieces. I have taken the liberty of sending one piece to the Geology Department of Northwestern University and the other piece was forwarded to our materials laboratory here at Wright-Field.

A visual analysis of the object was made and it appears that your object has some peculiar characteristics. Although this object appears to have no scientific value to the Air Force, I have asked for a basic electrochemical analysis in order to determine its material composition and possibly in this way be able to determine its historical background.

Perhaps your science class might be interested in our findings as soon as it becomes available. At the conclusion of the tests, I will also return your object.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR

Room for Shipping

ATTN/Mr Harold Shaw

1. Request you ship the attached rock to [redacted] of
Fairfield, Illinois.

2. This rock was turned over to representatives of the Air Force
at Scott AFB, Illinois, and from to Wright-Patterson AFB for
analysis, with the understanding that remainents, if any, be re-
turned as soon the analysis was completed.

3. This item is to be shipped by whatever means you deem neces-
sary. However, the object should be packed in a wooden crate
or box, packed so as not to incur further damage.

4. The cost of shipping may be funded by Project 0661-01.
