11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a basically stationary object which was changing colors. The colors were red changing to green, changing to white at 2 second intervals. The object looked like it was moving in a square pattern. A few seconds one way and then a few seconds another way. Also the object moved up and down. Object was finally lost due to the clouds in the area.

Navy P3V was airborne on routine patrol at the time of the sighting. This aircraft was asked to search the area; however, nothing unusual was noted. Sighting made on planet resulted in similar description. The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation.
