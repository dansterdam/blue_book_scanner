13. WHILE OBSERVING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON
The sound at sounded like something sliding
in a straight line across (my window) with a sharp
first contact. Guess as a lot of detail, then
dim. Long path. After the first sound I recorded
activity always ideal like a scene. Slight hears. The
sound found object for a few. Seconds longer than
the very little distance.

Went by the window out of my
sight now.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS MIGHT COLORS, BRIGHTNESS, AND INDICATE AN ARROW THAT WILL SHOW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

I could not see any shape, except the two lights very close together. There was not quite lights on it. By the several I theorized a solid object, there might have been a solid except the two-lights but nothing visible except the two-lights.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOT HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. IF YOU HAD PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
