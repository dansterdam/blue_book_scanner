Weston, Mass. Sightings - Page 5

The outstanding thing about the cloud was its uniform illumination, clear to the edges, although the edges were not distinct, and the angular diameter of the head and its persistence, and the length of the tail. Now, it was less than one hour after sunset and a large meteor burst-out and its resultant trail could possibly account for this. The color was not normal for by the sun just setting on the cloud at that height. But at a height of 75 or 100 miles, which is called for, the angular extent or this cloud would lead to probably large linear size. A cloud extending five degrees at a hundred miles up would be about eight miles in diameter, certainly enough large for a meteoric cloud. A cloud closer by, say ten miles away, would need to be only a half a mile in diameter, which is still large but feasible, the source of its light, however, would be a matter of conjecture. Noctilucent clouds are about that high, but generally do not have that shape, nor that apparent size. The long trail, actually, suggests the trail of a moving object.

If the two incidents of January 14th and 17th are connected, then whatever device was producing the light on January 14th might conceivably have produced the cloud of January 17th. It is obviously of great importance to establish the following facts:

(1) Did any of the local military air fields have a special experiment going on on these two dates? This should be followed up at once and exhaustively, for if it can be shown that these two sightings arose from man-made sources, a powerful case can be made for virtually all of the other similar sightings having the same cause. Because here we have an experienced and highly technically trained man, obviously and sincerely very puzzled by what he saw, and becomes of the high caliber of the witness, cracking this case is of great importance.

(2) We should know the exact weather conditions at the time of the sighting of January 17th. Were there other clouds in the sky? We know there was no moonlight. What were the winds aloft? This should be determined for the evenings of both sightings.

Since the input to this case has been exhausted as far as the witnesses are concerned, the next logical step is (a) to check with the local airport, police stations, etc., whether any other witnesses reported those two sightings, and (b) whether there was any special local activity at that time. Cases should certainly be made with Walsh Island and with Cape Kennedy. It is possible that this is a trail resulting from a launching.

Since there was both the helicopter and a commercial plane aloft at the time of the first sighting, it might be helpful to find out whether the local radar had these objects on their screens at that time in that area. Radar tracking of the first object will have no meaning if there was a commercial plane also.

Both Mr. [illegible] and Mr. [illegible] have requested that the results of the following be communicated to them. I can very logically that your office will be able to come up with a clear-cut and airtight solution to this problem in which, because of the manner in which it was witnessed and the manner in which it was reported, make it in more ways than one a potential trouble-maker. Good Luck!

This is an interview with [redacted], MIT, January 20, 1966.

On this interesting sighting -- let's go through the thing -- January 14th, 1966, you were -- supposed I say it in my own words and then you can correct. It was 5:55 P.M., you were just coming home to Weston, Massachusetts and -- what rate were you travelling?

Are you speaking of the first event?

Yes, the first event.

Well, the first event -- actually, I was home in the house changing my clothes, when the children sighted the object at 5:55.

And it was Jimmy who sighted it first?

Yes.

And he came in then yelling "There's a flying saucer outside"!

That is, the youngest boy came in -- Arthur.

Did he say -- something I forgot to ask before -- did he say anything about how long he had been watching this thing move?

It couldn't have been more than 3 minutes. They hollered outside when they first saw it. And it wasn't more than 3 minutes later when they came in.

Did he indicate where he saw it when he first saw it?

Later on, when we were watching the object he indicated that it had been at an altitude of about 300 and I would estimate an azimuth of 210.

Two ten? So -- in the southwest?

That is, yes.

So, the total arc that it covered would have been about what, would you estimate?

Through the two periods of motion?

Yes.

I would imagine approximately 50°.

That is then, as I see it, broken up into two parts.

The first time that he saw it coming in from -- say the southwest, -- at about an altitude of 30°, presumably it stopped then when it was due south.


- page 4 -

Here is the text from the document:

-7-

Almost exactly due south, and at an altitude of about 20°.

(A break in the recording.)

From the southwest to due south, from 210 to 180, about 25 or 30 degrees -- something like that, presumably. Did the boys say at all what first attracted their attention to it when it first appeared?

Due to the intensity of it -- and the scintillation of the color. It was very intense. It was quite brighter than a first magnitude star.

Something like Venus which is -- as a matter of fact, they might have seen Venus at that time. It would have been in the southwest -- very low in the southwest.

It was much brighter than Venus; much whiter.

This is the marvelous thing about having a good observer, because then one can both ask intelligent questions and get intelligent answers. How, why don't you just tell me again -- you got the binoculars from the service drawer --

(Going out of the house, I got my small glasses, which are actually 4 x 30, to observe the object. I really didn't believe I was going to see anything. In the meantime, my 15 year old boy, Roger, went back into the house and got the 6 x 30 Bausch and Lomb binoculars. He both observed the object. It appeared as an intense white -- maybe with a slight yellow-ish tint -- source, probably not a pinpoint source. And this single source was steady in intensity. There were, however, regions and patches which appeared to scintillate around the object, very much like a colored flame dancing around a central object.

Would it be anything like a welding arc, or acetylene torch --

Light from a central source. Are you speaking of the color?

I would describe it more as just a very small source in a very hot furnace, as a central source, with a type of flame, and then with this peripheral color dancing around the outside of it, the red and green -- the red bordered on the pink. The other thing we observed looking at the object through some small trees, its was quite evident that there was a wandering motion of the object with respect to the background of the trees, which seemed almost random, up and down and sideways, not at all rapid, but --

What was the frequency -- if you could describe any sort of frequency of oscillation to its motion, how many cycles per second --


- page 5 -

Uh, let me say that it would probably continue one particular direction or motion for approximately two or three seconds. Maybe even longer than that.

There is no reason -- as you said before we started recording this -- that made you feel that the motion was real and not an illusion of the eye, because you had the matrix of the branches ...

That's right.

Well, that certainly establishes that. And you were standing still.

Yes, right.

(Break in tape.)

All right. Then, how long did it stay in that hovering, wandering, meandering position?

Somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. I didn't actually time it.

That's interesting -- that long? Just before it started to move off to the southeast, did it give any indication that it was going to move, so to speak, by a change of color, intensity, or anything like that?

No, I didn't observe any change in color, intensity -- the object appeared exactly as it had previously.

When we talked about it before, you said something about it was a kind of eerie thing you had not experienced before. In fact, I think you said it was a sort of radiative kind of thing. Can you go into that a little more?

I don't know why I said that except that the source was extremely intense and it was of a color you would not expect to see generated by artificial means such as a lamp, or any known types of lamp.

How would it compare with a short circuit in an electrical wire, when you have two wires crossing, such as occurs in an ice storm.

There would be some similarity there except for the fluctuation of the color.

The central light was much more steady than you would expect in something like that.

Was the fluctuation also apparent to the unaided eye? What I am trying to get at is that I want to make sure that it is not a function of viewing through the glasses.


- page 6 -

Here is the text from the document:

-4-

Yes, it definitely was. When I first saw the object, that was the first thing that crossed my mind, that the flashlight or the color did not represent the same thing as the scintillation of a star. I had that recollection even before I put the glasses on it.

What did you think when you first saw it? Sometimes the first impressions are rather helpful. What did you think you were looking at?

My very first impression was -- is it an extremely bright star? But as I say, that thought was dispelled almost immediately, because of the fluctuation, of the red and green color. The second thought -- searching for a logical explanation -- was that it might be a landing light of an aircraft.

However, when I put the glasses on it, the extreme intensity for the very small source, did not resemble, nor did the colors in as much that, the landing lights of an aircraft.

Do you suppose it could have been an experimental craft of some sort trying out strob lights? Did it give you the impression of being a strob light?

No it was not.

I am trying to think -- there wasn't anything going on in that area at that time. This is the thing we are going to look into to find out whether there was anything in the air going on at that time. What Air Force base would it be out of? I think near Hanscom Field, that's us.

Well, I think we are a distance of about 6 miles or so south of Bedford, and this object was south of us.

Now, let's go back to the motion. First of all, was there any sound?

None.

None whatever. Then, let's say something about the manner in which it disappeared, and its second phase of motion, as far as you know, it was moving the whole time.

It was coming down from its altitude and decreasing its zenith. Unfortunately, the two that were observing at the time were younger. That was the impression I got talking to the boys.

But after observing the object for some 5 or 10 minutes in its apparent hovering position and the wandering, it started to increase its altitude and travel towards the west. And I would estimate it was about 1/2 mile an hour. It arrived at an azimuth of approximately 150°, which time it appeared to stop and hover again. This motion, although it did not seem to be in proximity to it, seems to be coincidental with the passing of an airplane.


- page 7 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

-5-

You had hesitations that there was an airliner coming from east to west, and a helicopter from west to east. ... This is a good point because these will tell many who will say that if you discount the peculiar nature of the lights, how would the motion differ from that of an aircraft?

I don't honestly see how I could call it an aircraft. Besides, I had both the plane and the helicopter for comparison.

(Break in tape.)

Well, then, it hovered for 4 or 5 minutes. It might have been 10 minutes.

No, it was longer than that. That, of course, was an estimate because a lot of excitement was going on.

By the way, did Mrs. W. also come out?

Oh, yes, she saw it, too.

(Break in tape.)

And then when it rose in altitude to 300, it became partly obscured by trees, at which time we went out into the street to observe it further, and I would say that at this time it was ... we were moving around, and I would say that at this time it was ... rather difficult, to describe its motion.

The only thing I can say for certain is that after probably another 5 minutes, keeping the azimuth constant but decreasing its altitude as though going away, until it finally disappeared from view. It could have been in level flight which would make it appear to get the lower altitude.

There is only one other item here and that was that, as I mentioned before, the next morning, I asked my oldest boy, 16, to describe if he could detect any shape in the central white light source. ... I asked Roger how he would describe the luminous center of the object in terms of shape, and he said that if it was anything other than a small disc, it appeared to him it might have a light hourglass shape. And this, actually, collaborated my own impressions. The angle subtended Jupiter -- that was with small glasses and it was quite small. Like you were walking Jupiter -- that was with small glasses and it was very difficult to confirm this, but we did both have the same impression -- but this very small point source was probably somewhat in the shape of an hourglass.

I think this sort of reviews our previous discussion. I can't think of any salient facts that were left out. ... Let's try to get the angular rates, whatever that was. I haven't got that far now. ... When you observed it moving toward the southeast, how would you ...


- page 8 -

Here is the text from the document:

it was going somewhat, I would say, in excess of a degree per second. It is difficult to estimate angles -- something in that quarter of magnitude.

(Break in tape.)

... Did the object disappear while you were watching it? ...

Well, that's a good question. Did the object move more behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

No, the object was visible continuously. Except, of course, behind the tree. But, of course, ...

...

Did the object move in front of something?

No.

All right. No sound, you said before, and we described the color ... "this is a good one, for instance -- hold a matchstick at arm's length and line up the object, in other words, with the match head. I have often tried it -- do you have a good old-fashioned match around here somewhere.

...

Actually, you were hard-pressed to tell what the shape of this single white object was because of ...

...

We described the velocity.

Yes.

And you have already told me that you couldn't estimate how far away it was. ... there should be a special form when you are asking for criticism.

Where were you when you saw the object?

Outdoors.

In fairly open countryside, isn't it? It's not really like the city, either, is it?

Well, there are no houses immediately across the street, and the houses are spaced about 200 feet apart.


- page 9 -

Here is the text from the document:

-7-

I would say that "open countryside" is more likely than.
Here the following used in the observation: (Haverhill), was, well, this 26th
is a nice question but I think we have covered that pretty well. What I do
frequently when talking to people who are not technically trained is simply
to say - well, now, if you had some magic hat 5f putting something up some-
where in the sky, what would you put up? And you would be surprised how many
times it helps, because somebody says "Well, I'd put up a kite's top," or
something like that, and it gives you a picture, remarkably, far better ...

Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before?
No, I never have.

Was someone else with you?
Yes.

We have your telephone number ..
It's Pembroke (?) 4-9205.

Age.
Forty-six.

Now, we have fulfilled our formal obligations. But the conversa-
sation (notes on conversation) are far more important than the form. One
thing I always like to ask is: what did you talk about after the thing had
disappeared. What were your emotional reactions?

Oh, my wife said maybe it was a satellite. I said how could a
satellite possibly go through the motions that this did.

Yes, and that long.

And so we agreed immediately that it was not a satellite. Of
course, Arthur, the youngest would like to relate this to some of his ex-
periences, but the older boy certainly agrees that there was nothing in his
experience that would allow him to account for what he had been looking at.

From what you described that you saw - I have certainly never
seen anything like it. Well, let's go down the lane to some intelligent
questions. You say it was mostly calm, but was there any prevailing wind
direction? Just to tell that out.

I don't recall. There was not enough wind that you would notice
it, standing out.

Well, we can check that. I don't see any point in the old idea
of the weather balloon - it couldn't be that because, well, look, after
these little ... about a half-inch. And the satellite would rule out. Air-
craft - I would tend to think, and you seemed to agree with me - virtually
out.

The document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch showing what seems to be a plane and a helicopter, with some annotations and a trajectory or path drawn. Some of the text is difficult to read due to the image quality.

Here is the text I can discern from the image:

[Bottom of page, partially legible]
"hearth near at

[Bottom of page, partially legible]
"cleared area\

Most of the text on the page is very faint and difficult to read clearly. The image appears to be a sketchy, hand-drawn diagram with some vertical lines and rough outlines, but the details are not crisp enough to confidently transcribe additional text.


- page 14 -

The image appears to be a very faint, low-contrast sketch or drawing of trees or tree-like shapes. The lines are light and somewhat blurry, creating an abstract representation of what seems to be a landscape or forest scene. Most of the page is white or very light gray, with thin, vertical lines suggesting tree trunks or branches. The drawing is very faint and difficult to make out clearly.

There is no legible text visible on this page.


- page 15 -

Most of the text on this page is illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. There appears to be some faint text or markings, but I cannot confidently read or transcribe them. The image looks like a scanned document page with a diagonal line or streak across it, but the details are too blurry to discern clearly.

Here is the text from the document:

Well, certainly any aircraft other than a helicopter would be ruled out, and the colors -- flickering green and red are definitely not the colors that are associated with aircraft. As I mentioned earlier, this was between the time the airliner and the helicopter came by so there were entirely different colors.

And the jet also?
Yes.

The helicopter which you viewed was mostly...

Yes, it was just a straight east-west motion, at a fairly nominal altitude. It went by to the south.

Also, of course, one could say if it had been far enough away not to be heard -- and yet at this apparent altitude it would have to ...

The only thing is that any light of that intensity on an aircraft -- first of all, the lights would not be that intense. And, also, one thing that was notable was the constancy of the white light -- the intense white light in the center. There was no fluctuation in this.

That is, the central source was constant.
Yes, that's right.

It didn't give you the impression of giving off sparks?
No, if you had just a white object with perhaps ? (dashes?) of flames dancing around it, -- it was this type of thing.

It was already established that there was no moon. It must have quite a jewel-like effect, then, probably against the clear sky. It was a surprising incident and then what fundamentally claimed your attention was the color -- the scintillation of the color. ... As I know bright than 4 magnitude, and as you know each magnitude ...

Oh, it was much brighter than that. And I would suspect that unless Venus was well out of orbit it could not have possibly been in the position that I observed.

No, that is not. Well, any star is out, because a star doesn't move from one place to another. Well, what's out, certainly not. All I will certainly have the office check most carefully into whether and where anything was going on at that time. And, of course, if it was going on whether it matters. I can't think of anything further to ask here.

I don't recall anything that we have omitted. I just have no explanation at all of what was observed.


- page 20 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

-9-

Well, this is why Winston calls me he says: "I wouldn't ordinarily call you on something like this, but I know Roger and if he says it was of a type that he couldn't explain, it would be worth a plain." That's what he said. He certainly took it very seriously...
So, now, the cloud that looks like an umbrella:

I don't know the proper name of the color. There is an antique reddish-orange that is used, say, in 1875 or early, well, it's a reddish-orange, it's not tangerine, it's more red than that. I know I have a mirror at home that is exactly the same color.

Sort of a burnished copper?

No, this is definitely red. But it appeared that the light was being emitted from the cloud rather than reflecting. I think this was brought on by two things: One is the color was completely uniform throughout the whole cloud on vapor trail, and that was at diminished, at diminished only in intensity without changing the actual spectrum at all.

And the whole thing subtended about 7° (?) you said. ... The head itself -- the main portion that lasted the longest, what would you say the angular extent of that was:

I think I would up my angular estimate on that, because using the bowl of the Big Dipper as a reference, the head itself would be approximately that size, so then that I think would put the part of it in proportion.

At least ten degrees?

Oh, yes. That vapor trail appearing portion of it extended off into the distance.

You know what would be an interesting thing here would be if you were to write a note for me to the Astronomical Journal, just describing it, making no allegations or connections of any sort, just simply as one would describe in a medical journal a rare tropical disease. I think it might be of great value. I am going to try you on a new angle -- because -- in fact, why don't you -- well, how tired are you now, if we put on a few tags and you describe what happened from the time you turned the corner, etc. -- I can write it up and you won't have to.

-- This was January 17, 1966, at 5:15 P.M. and the sun had set.

you mentioned, at 5:15. O.K., now you are driving home -- you take it far there.

I made a right-angle turn from Highland Street on to Pine Street and westerly. As soon as I turned the corner, even with the headlights, my headlights by the William Clapp, or whatever it was, in the southwest sky. In fact, I could scarcely keep my eyes on the road for watching it.


- page 21 -

Here is the text from the document:

How far away from home were you then?

Only about four-tenths of a mile. And so I then drove back into the driveway and went in to get the family out to observe it. They came out very promptly. My eldest boy was 11 was most interested in it. The younger one couldn't work up much interest. Oh close observation the central, nearest portion not only -- let me back up -- the whole object glowed with a red-ish, reddish glow as far as the earth form color. Also, looking toward the larger central portion, as shown in the sketch, there appeared to be a reddish glow in the sky which was rather general in nature and extended up almost as far as the earth.

By the way, did we say this was hovering about 30° upward or so?

Well, the object itself -- the central portion -- would be 30° and it appeared that. Other than the central portion, was going away, becoming a greater distance off, with the exception of the portion right across the front which seemed to be going right straight across the field of view.

But the lower portion of the drawing is near the horizon as far as I could tell.

You have the impression that the lower portion was closer -- as I remarked before it is possible but I don't think it is -- that this was a meteoric cause of things becoming more and more in your line of sight, and this was way off in the distance and this would have ...

If you had something that was mist-like (?) or possibly re-flected, although it was kind of late for position -- it could have come in making a vapor trail and then explode, because this central portion was definitely a big, diffuse, round thing.

It actually could explode, they sometimes do, but not in a cloud.

But that would have to be at an altitude higher than where you get a vapor trail associated with it.

In the daytime a bolide can leave a smoke trail that looks something like a contrail, and it is a somewhat curly thing. ...

I have seen some fairly sizeable meteors.

WALLOPS LAUNCHES SIX
EXPERIMENTS OVERNIGHT

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducted six experiments between sunset and dawn last night from its Wallops Island, Va., Station.

Five of the payloads were chemical cloud experiments launched at 5:39 p.m., 7:32 p.m., 9:00 p.m., 12:12 a.m. and 6:31 a.m. EST. The twilight and dawn firings were sodium vapor experiments which generated reddish-orange clouds visible for hundreds of miles along the East Coast. The other three payloads consisted of trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor trails which formed blue-green clouds high above the earth. The payloads were flown on Nike-Apache research rockets and the vapor trails were ejected at altitude ranges of about 30 to 130 statute miles.

Purpose of these experiments was to measure wind velocities and directions at various altitudes in the upper atmosphere. Data on wind conditions are obtained by photographing the

Well, the thing that was amazing about this was the uniformity
of the color. It was completely uniform, even in the course of time as it
faded away. The color did not change. It started out being very intense.

Yes, that intensity. Let's see, how can we describe it -- for
pare the intensity to?

Well, let's say that at its brightest, when I first saw it,
was approximately the same as a brilliant cloud right at sunset.

Well, that gives me a picture. But even here I am going to ask
the Air Force to work on it to see what weather or experiment or some such thing
was going on at that time.

Even my oldest boy described my feelings exactly when he said it
was eerie.

I wish I could see something like that. I never have.

I never have before. These two possibly associated events are
the only things like this that I have ever seen.

CHEMICAL CLOUDS TO BE VISIBLE
ALONG EAST COAST

A National Aeronautics and Space Administration chemical experiment, beginning January 17, will send huge and easily visible colored clouds wafting along the eastern coast of the United States.

Weather conditions permitting, the first of five vapor cloud launchings is scheduled for Monday at 5:38 p.m. EST. The other vapor experiments are to be fired one and one-half, three, and six hours after the first launch, with the remaining experiment scheduled for about 6:45 o'clock Tuesday morning.

The dusk-to-dawn firings for meteorological research in the upper atmosphere will be at NASA's Wallops Station on the Virginia Coast.

Both sodium vapor and trimethylaluminum (TMA) experiments will be conducted in this series. Two-stage solid propellant Nike-Apache research rockets will be programmed to eject trails of vapor from about 50 to 125 statute miles altitude.

NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

January 29, 1966

Report of the Weston, Massachusetts Sightings of
January 14 and 17, 1966

Introduction

On January 13, 1966, while at a National Science Foundation meet-
ing in New Orleans, I received a call from Dr. Winston Markey, director of the
Laboratory for Experimental Astronomy, at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology. Dr. Markey last year was Air Force Chief Scientist, and is still
closely associated with that office although he is now back at MIT.

Dr. Markey asked whether I might come to Boston immediately to
help clear up, if possible, sightings that had been reported to him by
Mr. Roger Woodbury, a man in whom Dr. Markey said, he had the utmost confri-
dence and whose reliability as an observer and as a person of technical com-
petence he would not question. Mr. Woodbury is Associate Director of the
Instrumentation Laboratory at MIT and has been associated with Dr. Stark
Draper, Director of the Instrumentation Laboratory, and with Dr. Markey, for
the past twelve years. The Instrumentation Laboratory, you will recall, is
responsible for the guidance system in the Polaris missiles.

When, therefore, Dr. Markey asked me to come to Boston I thought
this case more than warranted ordinary attention, since in all probability it
will also come to the attention of the present Chief Scientist of the Air
Force, Dr. Robert Lowey. Accordingly, I made arrangements to go to Boston at
the earliest opportunity which proved to be Saturday, January 22nd. I went
almost immediately to MIT and talked with Mr. Woodbury for more than two hours
in the offices of Dr. Stark Draper. Clearances for admittance into the
Instrumentation Laboratory had been taken care of previously.

A good part of our discussions were tape-recorded (see attached)
but the basic details of the two sightings are these. The two sightings,
although apparently quite different in nature, occurred within three days of
each other, and at the same time of day, at the same geographical location,
and in nearly the same part of the sky. It is logical, therefore, to seek a
possible connection between the two events.

Sighting No. 1, January 14, 1966, 5:55 P.M. (sunset 4:50 P.M.)

kept there. Later _____ came in for some snack and lamb general service
but ______. Mr. ______ said that he didn't expect to see anything unusual
but was going out to see what all this commotion was about. For the ensuing
twenty minutes or so he apparently was thoroughly impressed by what he saw,
and has, as yet, been unable to explain it. By this time Mr. ______ was
outside he saw the light, which his son Arthur said had been moving in slowly,
from the southwest, due south and at an elevation of about 30°. Two things
struck him _______ as outstanding: the nature of the light, and its motion,
both then, during the hovering phase, and after it took off. The interrogations of the other members of the family indicated to me that both items also
puzzled them, but in general the motions or the object while hovering seemed
to the other four witnesses to be even more unusual than the light itself.

Mr. ______, in fact, gathered, that it was the light that was even more remarkable than the motions.

He described the light as one having a white spectrum, one of
very high color-temperature, during his sighting, including, the had for
comparison a passing airliner, and a helicopter, and neither the motions of
these or the lights that they carried, bore any resemblance to the same items
in his UFO. The light was described as essentially a point source, even in
binoculars, although in the latter it apparently substantiated about the same
angle that Jupiter would (two-thirds of a minute of arc). In the binoculars,
the witness argued, the light seemed to be pinned in the middle, somewhat
like an hourglass. The central white light was likened to a welder's arc at
about a block or half a block, but it was whitish rather than blue. Around
the perimeter of the light, the witness reported coruscations, the
light scintillating in different colors with a strong tendency to red and
pink. Mr. ______ was emphatic that the scintillation in this case in no
way resembled that of a star. He said that it gave him the feeling that a
radioactive source was in operation, although he had no means of backing up
this impression. There seemed to be no question but that the light was better than ordinary, rather than being reflected. He also said that the light was
but at its brightest it was described as brighter than Venus. There was no
star or planet due south of the observer at that time, which could account
for the position of the object. Let alone its brightness and its hovering and
direct motion.

With respect to the maneuvers of the object during the five or
ten minutes that it was observed in the due south position, Mr. ______ stated that it was seen in three or nearly four branches, which branches served as a reference framework for judging the motions of the light. In his opinion, and in that of three other observers, there is
no question but that the light did actually move through small areas in
various directions during the normal phase. We are here dealing with
the testimony of a man who is used to observing deviations of a few seconds
of arc in guidance systems and who is really aware that there is a difference
between illusory motion and real motion.

After five or ten minutes, and _____ is not sure of the
time since the excitement was running high and no one was looking at a watch,
the object moved to the southeast and upward, as though directed and then

becoming obscured by trees, all observers moved to the roadway where they could get a better view. It then reached the second stage of hovering, but for a much shorter period and then moved southeastward, losing elevation (losing angular elevation), although he pointed out this was probably due to the fact that it was increasing its distance in level flight. The anti's incident lasted about twenty or twenty-five minutes, from the time the boys first spotted it until it disappeared in the distance. When moving the most rapidly, it covered about 10 per second of time.

The comments of some of the other observers, and the general circumstances of the sighting, deserve mention. When his partner impression was that it was a satellite, but if hovering went out essentially one place for five minutes ruled that out, as of course did his nature of the light. He just had a drink, remarked as one place that he had been alone, and other witnesses concerned, the neighbors were too far away to call and witnesses. He was too interested in watching the object to try to summon other witnesses. He described the manner in which the light changed colors and intensity as that akin to a "color organ" rather than to a light being changed by pushbutton.

To indicate the type of observer he is, he reported on his own the condition of the eyes of the various members of his family. In. Not wear glasses and is extremely farsighted. Whereas his wife is farsighted. For reading he needs glasses. He has good vision, while is quite nearsighted. Roger, the oldest son, is slightly nearsighted.

Who used 6 x 20 binoculars, reported that the object appeared as though the light originated at the "bright spot", with the bright color diffusing, so to speak, going up into the left where it spread out into a pale color.

All observers reported the plane traveling toward the northwest and the helicopter traveling toward the northeast. With his binoculars he could see the helicopter by virtue of the reflection of its own lights. Both the plane and the helicopter traveled in straight flight.

As to the motion while hovering, it was hard to get at. It was variously described as jogging up and down, at random, and not quite at random but somewhat in a spiral, and generally as wandering. When it began to move, it appeared to travel directly to the south. No business.

In making this report he is understood that he is reporting it officially to the Air Force, that he has no desire for publicity. He has requested that any information would be gathered rather about the possible cause of the sighting would be appreciated. He does not intend to do so.

The transcription of the tapes will aid further to the general description of the event and in addition, the boys have furnished me with completely independent drawings of the manner in which the object moved, especially when hovering.

Sighting No. 2, Evening of January 17th, 1966.

This is the sighting made by [redacted] on the evening of January 17th, at 5:45 P.M.; sunset was 4:59. [Redacted] was reluctant to make this second report, thinking that perhaps he might be regarded as having "flipped his lid." But inasmuch as he had never previously had any experience like this, and inasmuch as the two events may conceivably be connected, he felt it was to maintain the matter to me. He has reported the second sighting to no one else.

The second sighting, except for geographical location, position in the sky, and time of day, was quite unlike the first sighting. It can be described in much briefer terms. It was again observed by the same witnesses but the boys, in particular, were much interested. In this one, that in the first, as [redacted] put it, that though of it as a cloud rather than as an unknown object. This time [redacted] was just out of five ways from home, driving in his car, and as he turned the right angle into the street leading to his house, his attention was immediately taken by a bright, muddy, fairly large cloud standing by itself. In the Southwest sky at an elevation of between 60 and 30°, he could easily see it through his windshield, so its angular elevation could not have been very high.

[Redacted] made a drawing on the blackboard, with the appropriately colored chalk incidentally, to indicate how it looked. I reproduce here the cloud with angular dimensions and time duration.
