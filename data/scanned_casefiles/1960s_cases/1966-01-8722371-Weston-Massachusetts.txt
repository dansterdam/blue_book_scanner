OCR Text:

Weston, Mass. Sightings - Page 5

The outstanding things about the cloud were its uniform luminosity, the fact that it was rather unlike the normal ground level clouds, and the persistence and the length of the trail. There was also a glow, brighter than the rest of the cloud, which seemed to originate from the center, and it was this glow resulting from the cloud that could passibly account for what the observer described as the peculiarities. It was also noted that the cloud originally appeared to be about the size of a small house, but grew to a size approximately 3 to 4 hundred feet in diameter. A cloud extending such enormous size would tend to attract a great deal of attention in the sky.

If the two incidents of January 14th and 17th are connected, then whatever device was producing the light on January 14th might have continued to do so on January 17th.

(1) Did any of the local military air fields have a special experiment going on or those two dates? This should be followed up, for it can be shown that these sightings are quite similar to certain military exercises being made for virtually all of the other similar sightings having been shown to have an experienced and highly technically trained man, obviously a very puzzled but awestruck, rather than terrified, reaction, indicating these cases to be of great importance.

(2) If there were weather conditions at the time of the sighting of January 17th, were there other clouds in the sky that seem to confirm the sighting of the peculiar cloud, since this should be determined for the sightings of each occasion.

Since there was both the helicopter and a commercial plane aloft at the time of the first sighting, it might be helpful to find out whether the flight path and altitudes of these objects could account for the glow seen and the peculiar movement of the cloud. A constant record of the radar tracking of the helicopter's and commercial plane's movements would be extremely useful.

This image does not contain any photograph, it is a page from a typed document that appears to be a transcript of an interview. 

Transcribed text:

This is an interview with ____ on January 20, 1966.

On this interesting sighting -- let's go through the thing -- January 7th, 1966, you were -- supposed you say it in my own words and that's what you said and it was 6:55 p.m. and were just coming home to supper, Kansas. 

Are you speaking of the first event?
Yes, the first event.

Well, the first event -- actually, it was about in the house -- changing my clothes. When the children sighted the object at 6:55.  

And it was Winny who sighted it first.
Yes. 

And he came in then yelling "There's a flying saucer outside!"
That is, the youngest boy came in -- Arthur.

And he say -- something -- I forget to ask before -- did he say anything about how long he had been watching this thing move?
It couldn't have been more than 3 minutes... about 3 minutes later when they came in.

And it wasn't more than 3 minutes seen. And it wasn't more than 3 minutes later when they came in.

Did he indicate where he saw it when he first saw it?
Later on, when we were watching the object, he indicated that it had been at an altitude of about 500 and I would estimate an azimuth of --

Two-ten 3-- in the southwest?
That is, yes.

So the local are that it covered would have been about what, through the two periods of motion? 
Yes.
I would imagine approximately 50°.
That is then, as I see it, broken up into two parts.

The first line that he saw it coming from -- say, the south--
due south.

- page 4 -

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten annotations.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

Almost exactly due south, and at an altitude of about 25°. 
(a break in the recording.)

From the southwest to due south, from 30° to 135°, along or about the course first attracted their attention to it when it first appeared.

Due to the intensity of it, it was mistakable of the color. 
It was very intense. It was quite brighter than a very bright star.

Something like Venus which is - - - as a matter of fact, they didn't have Venus at that time. It would have been much brighter than Venus; much whiter.

This is the marvelous thing about having a good observer, because going out on the house, I got my small glasses, which are actually 4 x 30, to observe the object. I really didn't believe it was going to be anything at all when I got outside. It appeared to be an intense white - - maybe with a slight yellowish tinge. There was already an intensity so great it appeared to be practically square on the horizon, and this minute object was there, almost suddenly. This seemed almost harder to understand. It just seemed to suddenly appear in about that position and this minute object was there. They would have to explain this again - - you got the binoculars from the house.

Light from a central source. Are you speaking of the color?

(Break in tape.)

I would describe it more as just a very small source in a very hot region, as a central source which has the type of flame, and then with this concentration of light and flame - a center, and through some small tracts, it was quite evident that there was a wandering motion of the object with respect to the frame which seemed almost random, up and down and sideways, not at all rapid, but just a wandering motion.

This was the frequency - - if you could consider any part of the frequency to the function to the function per second - - 

- page 5 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a typed or handwritten document page from a UFO report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"The log indicates that it would probably continue for some particular duration of problem for approximately two or three seconds. Maybe even longer than that.

This - as I said before we started recording the air -  data, indicates that the witnesses in question were able to see this phenomenon very well, and not at a distance or anything. 

That's right.

Well, that certainly establishes that. And you were standing still.

Yes, right.

(Break in tape.)

All right. When, how long did it stay in that hovering, varying, meandering position?

Somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. I didn't actually time it.

That's interesting -- that longer - just before it started to move, did it give any indication that it was going to move, so to speak? or anything like that?

No, I didn't observe any change in color, intensity -- the object appeared to be steady as far as I'm concerned.

When we talked about it before, you said something about it being kind of radioactive kind of thing. Can you go into that a little more?

I don't know why I said that except that the source was ex-treme so a kind of artificial means such as a laser, or any known types of lamp.

How would it compare with a short circuit in an electrical wire, when you have the wires exposed and sparking in an dim storm?

There would be some similarity there except for the fluctuations of the color.

The central light was much more steady than one would expect in something like that.

Yes the function also suggest - this doesn't seem to be one that I want to go into, except that it is not a function of the way I'm handling through the answer."

Text from the document:

Yes, it definitely was. When I first saw the object, that was my first impression; it did not represent the same thing as the incineration of a star. I had that immediate impression. 

What did you think when you first saw it? I noticed the first impressions are rather helpful. What did you think you might be looking at?

But as I say that thought was dispelled almost immediately because of the fluctuations of the intensity. The explanation now given is that of a planet reflecting sunlight. However, when it first grew in the distance, my thought was that it might be landing lights of an aircraft. 

Do you suppose it could have been an experimental craft of some sort trying to burn through here? Did it have the impression of being a craft?

No it was not.

I am trying to think - there wasn't anything going on in that area at that time. This is the direction we are going in to find out. Whatever the object was, it did not seem to be doing anything out of the ordinary that would have attracted special attention.

Now, lets go back to the motion: first of all, was there any identifying sound?

None.

Okay, whatever it was, then lets say something about the manner in which it disappeared, and its second phase of motion. As far as you know, it was moving the whole time...

It was coming down from its altitude and decreasing the altitude. Unfortunately, the two that were observing it at the time were younger. That was the impression.

But after observing the object for some 5 or 10 minutes in the bright moonlight, it disappeared into the distance gradually, and it would estimate the altitude went back up again. It is hard to approximate that accurately.

- page 7 -

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. 

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

You had mentioned that there was an airplane coming from east to west, and a helicopter from west to east in this area at that time. There will be many who will not believe that there was a good possibility that there will be, but if this is how it would differ from that of an airplane?

I don't honestly see how it could call it an airplane. Besides, I had both the plane and the helicopter for observation.

(Break in tape.)

Well, then, it hovered for 4 or 5 minutes.

No, it was longer than that - it might have been 10 minutes.

By the way, did Mrs. W. also come out?
Oh, yes, she saw it, too.

(Inaud. in tape.)

And then when it rose in altitude to 30°, it became partly obscured by trees, at which time we went out into the street because we thought this was really something, we were trying to get a look at it - it is rather difficult equipment to observe.

The only thing I can say for certain is that, after probably 4 or 5 minutes, forgetting the altitude change, it started descending. It called this descent as though going away, until it finally disappeared into the distance. I do not know in which direction it had been going or if it had been coming in to get the lower altitude.

There is only one other item here and that is that, as I mentioned earlier, there were two reddish lights. I wish my observations to me, and those checkered my earlier, if the control could be of interest, or I am asked where of nature did the phenomenon seem to me, as they were in some of a nature all to me and I am not able to conduct this but I do believe it represents just what appeared to me. The angle surprised me so small as it appeared to be, and I am sure I was not deceived in size - it seemed rather unusual. Oh, I attempted everything to observe this, but it was difficult.

I think this sort of a negative situation. I can't think of any other way to put it. We'll have to try to think if there is something favorable that can be derived: In what direction was it moving - how would you ...

There is no photograph present in the shared image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing handwritten text.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

It was going somewhat, I would say, in a diagonal direction. It was difficult to estimate the altitude or magnitude.

(Break in tape.)

Well, there's a good question. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? ...

No, the object was visible continuously. Except, of course, behind the trees.

Did the object move in front of something?

No.

All right. The sound, you said, was of a large nature. I regarded the color as a single length and line up. It was a deep, almost white blue, 
I have often tried it -- do you have a good old-fashioned match around here someplace?

Actually, you were hard-pressed to tell what the shape of the single white object was because of ...

We described the velocity.

Yes.

And you have already told us that you couldn't estimate how far away it was. Where should be a specify form when you are telling for.

No, there's really nothing else important. It's not like the city, either. Like the houses are spaced about 500 feet apart.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I would say that experience is more likely there. Were the following on the identification, yes, this 26th is a case question, but I don't we have gone into that pretty well. Were some of then very like your ball as bright, sometimes constellations? And what would you put up? And you would be surprised how many times in a night, I saw just something like that, and it gave you a picture, immediately, far better - 

Have you seen this, or a similar object before?

No, I never have.

Was someone else with you?

Yes. 

We have your telephone number - 
it's Rembrandt (?) 4 - 9255.

Okay.

Forty-six.

Now, we have fulfilled our formal obligations. But the conversation (notes on conversation) are more important than the form. One thing I always like to ask is - what did you talk about after the thing had disappeared? 

Oh, my wife said maybe it was a satellite. I said how could a satellite be regularly pounded back to this did.

Yes. And that long. 

And so we agreed immediately that it was not a satellite. Of course, Arthur, the youngest would like to think it was anything like that, but he's a little too imaginative. But the children got this idea so firmly in their mind that it must have been a satellite, and it was very hard to shake them of it.

From what you described that you saw -- I have certainly never seen anything like it. I have seen the long, distant satellites, but this was something quite different, and the time they say they saw it, was was very noticeable, with occasional flashes of light and the changing of its direction, which of course satellites do not do.

I don't recall - there was not enough mind than you would believe that, to stand out -- 

Well, I do thank you very much that I don't say anything going to the old man, of the visions of the ballet, the professor at Harvard, and the president's plans. And the practical joke is raised again -- I would not try to choke, and you seem to care, so I cannot thank you enough.

OCR Text:

Well, certainly any witness, other than a helicopter pilot, would be entitled to any criticism or ridicule that might be associated with this matter. This was mentioned earlier. This was between the time the initial sighting was made and the time the helicopter showed up. And she was associated with several helicopter pilots associated with their craft. One or more helicopters showed up, either as a result of the sighting or else previously scheduled for the area. This was mentioned earlier. This was a helicopter, not an aircraft, lights.

And the jet also?

Yes.

The helicopter which you viewed was mostly ...
at altitude. It was by the south. 
Also, of course, she could say if it had been a helicopter up at the altitude -- well, if it had been far enough away not to be heard -- And yet at the same altitude she would have been able to see, of course.

The only thing is that any light of that intensity, on an aircraft, -- first of all, those lights would not be used by the airliners. Also, she claims that the intensity of the white light -- the intense white light in the center. That is, the central source was constant.

Yes, that's right.

It didn't give you the impression of giving off sparks?
No, it just had just a white steady corona -- (dashear) of flames dancing around it, -- it was this type of thing.

It was already established that there was no noise. It must have been something, prospably remote controlled. It wasn't a color -- the intensification of the color -- the coloration of the object was to me much brighter than that. And I would suggest that unless some source will cut off, or bottle up, or something, was in a position that I observed, he could not possibly have been in the position that I observed.

No, that is right. Well, any star is out, because a star doesn't go away, and the object that was sighted actually was going on at some distance, there was carefully into whether the stars were moving with the airplane or whether the airplane was moving with the stars, and it was going on in its own, this has to be something the explanation at all of the observers.
