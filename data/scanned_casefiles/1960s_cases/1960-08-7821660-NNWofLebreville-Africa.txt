(3) APPROXIMATELY 22/2200Z, SIDI AIRWAYS REQUESTED VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION GIVEN CONGO AIRWAYS AND ASKED IN ADDITION, FOR COLOR, DIRECTION, ALTITUDE AND DID THE OBJECT HIT THE WATER? THIS WAS ASKED IN RELAY FOR CHATEAUX. INFORMATION WAS GIVEN AT THIS TIME. (4) CREW FIRST LANDING AFTER SIGHTING WAS SIDI SLIMANE AB MOROCCO, AT 23/0955Z. COMPLETION OF INTERROGATION WAS AT 23/1400Z. COMMENTS: DUE TO AIRCRAFT COMMANDER'S ELEVEN THOUSAND FLYING HOURS AND HIS DEFINATE STATEMENTS: (1) THAT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT A METEOR SIGHTING AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED METEORS, BUT RATHER LIKE THE SIZE AND APPEARANCE OF THE SOVIETS FIRST SPUTNIK WHICH HE HAD OBSERVED.

IT IS BELIEVED POSSIBLE THIS SIGHTING COULD HAVE BEEN A MISSILE SIGHTING THAT WAS OFF COURSE FROM THE FRENCH MISSILE RANGE IN NORTH AFRICA. IF FURTHER INFORMATION IS DESIRED, THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE CONTACTED AT 4TH MATS TRANSPORT PROVISIONAL SQUADRON, CHATEAUX AIR STATION, FRANCE. THE CREW IS ON AN INDEFINITE TDY THERE FOR CONGO AIR LIFT.

Description cont,

Size of the flash was at least 2 feet in diameter at arms length. After explosion a bluish green trail was observed in an arc of about 20 deg with length about 5 feet long and 1 foot high when held at arms length. The clout was observed being dispated by the wind. The cloud lasted for 9 minutes. the xirm object is second. The flash and cloud was estimated to be about 50 NM from observers position.

Date 22 August 1960 Hour (Z) 1751Z
WX Vis unl, solid undercast, scattered clouds x* above
Description Round, size of volly ball at arms length, orange, first seen dead ahead (299 deg) 80 deg elev, last seen at 240 deg 45 deg elev, object moved south in a downward arc, it exploded in a brilliant flash at an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 ft altitude after about 4 seconds of obs on x* its course (over)
Direction of Motion South
Satellite: (AFOIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Prob meteor (bolide)
Radar Analysis (AFOIN-4E1) None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc) -------
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. Ruled out
Other
Evaluation of Source Reliability Prob reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The apparent size, shape and speed of the object rule out a missile such as reporting officer suggested. There was no satellites presenting at this time. The description of the object is vary similar to that of a meteor as seen in the daylight hours. When a meteor enters the atmosphere in the daytime, the burning substance leaves a trail/streak that cannot be seen at night. The passage probably saw a type of meteor or bolide that cannot enter the earth's atmosphere and explode.
