11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an object that looked similar to a meteor. It traveled from N to S and appeared to stop. The observer went into the house and when he came out again it was gone.

COMMENTS: The observer is 11 years old and has seen other similar UFOs. Since the observer does not state how long it took the light out of the sky, the moving light source could have been a meteor or a satellite, and the stationary light source was probably a star.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

This replies to your recent letter in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the inclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's. In the Project Blue Book we are inclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

Here is the text from the document:

CA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN A* AND B*. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
