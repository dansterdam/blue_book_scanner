11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an object that looked similar to a meteor. It traversed from South to South East and appeared to stop. The observer went into the house and when he came out again it was gone. The observer is 13 years old and has seen other similar UFOs. Since the observer does not state how long it took the moving light to stop, the observation time could have been longer than 25 minutes. The secondary light source was probable a star.

This incident occurred around 7t3o P.M. on March 4, 1969 in Fall River, Massachusetts.

The image contains two photographs. The larger photograph appears to be a compass or directional diagram, with labels indicating the cardinal directions. The smaller photograph shows a silhouetted figure standing in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

DATA/SCANNED/1960S_SCANNED/1969-03-6780081-FALLRIVER-MASS.PDF8.TXT

THE COMPASS AS SHOWN IN THIS PICTURE IS USED BY THE OBSERVERS TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN, AND AS A CHECK TO SEE IF THE OBJECT HAS MOVED OR IF THE OBSERVATION POSITION HAS CHANGED. WHEN LAST SEEN, THE OBJECT WAS IN THE ESE DIRECTION. THE FLIGHT PATH IS CLEARLY INDICATED BY THE TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING THE OUTLINE OF THE OBJECT AS SEEN AGAINST THE HORIZON AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE SIDE.

Reported kindly, there appeared to be a brightly gleaming metallic object, spherical to round in shape, bright silver or white in color, appearing to be in flight during daylight, just below an overcast sky. The object maneuvered at various angles, swiftly and smoothly. In appearance it seemed about the size of a car or perhaps smaller, but it was difficult to judge its exact size and distance as it continued its flight. There was no trail or exhaust visible, and it did not seem to be powered by any conventional means. It was in sight for several minutes before disappearing quickly, almost as if it had burst into the clouds or beyond. The observer was unable to determine the exact flight path or final destination of the object but it was observed to be in powered, controlled flight.

The image contains a rough sketch or drawing of a saucer-shaped object. The accompanying text describes the object as "Not seemed of any familiar kind" and "darting changing of shape". There is no photograph present in this image.

Text extracted from the document:

"Not seemed of any familiar kind.
A very close observation at a low height.
Darting changing of shape, as tho 'fluttering' at high speed.
The center, as the 'body', seemed to contain some 'opening' or 'windows'.
All of the object well lighted from within, as tho 'glowing'.
Disappeared rapidly and silently, upward and forward.
All of the incident would have been covered by the match head."
