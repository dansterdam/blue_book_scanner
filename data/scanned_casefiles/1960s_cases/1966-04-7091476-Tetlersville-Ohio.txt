The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically case 10073, which occurred on 23 April 1966 in Tetlersville, Ohio. The document provides details about the location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation, and physical evidence. The brief summary and analysis section states that a "glowing white and red light" was observed, and the witness testimony is considered "conflicting" and "makes it virtually impossible to make a proper analysis."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and some text instructions related to a UFO sighting report. The instructions appear to be asking the observer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture based on it, as well as provide details about the observed objects and their motion.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on the "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show from what direction you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
