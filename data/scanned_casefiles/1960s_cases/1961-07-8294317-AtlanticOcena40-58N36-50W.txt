PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 7 Jul 59
2. LOCATION: Atlantic Ocean 40-58N 36-50W
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0300Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. SENSOR: Visual
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 mins
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: 1 light, slight upward and rapid downward movement and disappeared, irregular pattern. Object appeared to be very high and distant.
11. COMMENTS: Estimating the range of this object, it was impossible observation to make as there were no reference points of comparison. This fact alone makes it impossible to make an accurate estimate of the size of the object or its altitude. However, the overall observation, including the visual and flight characteristics, leads to the conclusion that this was probably an astronomical object or aircraft. There is no evidence to indicate that this was an extraterrestrial device.
