UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
LOCATION: Sunnyvale, California
DATE: 8 October 1965
TIME: 2015 Hours
REPORTING OFFICER: Lt. Col. George T. Piersall, USAF
OBSERVER: Mr. Norman B. Stevens, age 35, 1150 Levin Ave., Sunnyvale, Calif.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
Mr. Stevens reported that at approximately 2015 hours on 8 October 1965, while driving southbound on Highway 101, 1 mile south of Sunnyvale, California, he observed an unidentified object in the sky. Mr. Stevens stated that the object was bright white in color, oval in shape, and approximately the size of a basketball. He indicated that the object was traveling in a southerly direction at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet and at a speed estimated to be about 500 mph. Mr. Stevens stated that the object was observed for approximately 6-8 seconds before it disappeared from view. He further stated that the object made no sound and left no vapor trail.

Mr. Stevens, who is employed as an electronics engineer for a local electronics firm, impressed this investigator as being a mature, intelligent, and reliable observer. There were no other witnesses to this observation.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the details of observation provided by the witness, this incident is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. While the characteristics of the object as described by Mr. Stevens are consistent with a number of natural and man-made phenomena, a conclusive identification could not be made.

Southington, Connecticut 
2 Oct 55

SAUCER LANDING IN CONNECTICUT: Just before press time, we learned of an sensational incident that occurred on the nights of October 2nd, 1958 and 3rd, in Southington, Connecticut. According to police lieutenant Ruben Taylor, a UFO landed and a man emerged from it. The craft was only 50 feet above the ground and 30 feet in diameter. He described it as being 24 car lengths in diameter, and 33 lengths high. It had a corrugated bottom, and numerous lights including four "portholes" type lights on the side. After several seconds it ascended to a high hill several hundred yards distant, and on several occasions it swooped down again to various parts of the countryside. Policeman Taylor was a skeptic until he saw it himself. Southington police chief confirmed the sighting, but it shows only a white speck at some distance from the camera, against the night sky.

South America
4 October 63

Throughout October, November, and December, dozens of UFO incidents continued to occur throughout South America. Among the most startling was an incident reported on October 8, concerning three children who claimed they were almost blinded by a small luminous creature, disappearance, which took place at about the same time in Santiago del Estero, where a gigantic creature disappeared "enveloped in a cloud of dust" before the eyes of several children who had gone to get water from a dam. In neither of these cases was a flying saucer seen, according to our information.

Text from the document:

January 13, 1966

Mrs Hunt/an/SAFOICC/723/2/11 Jan 66

Dear Mr. [redacted],

I apologize for the delay in answering your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

I am enclosing a copy of the report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO project. This report contains information on our project since its origin in 1947.

Articles such as those published by you in the Sarp-Winter magazine on October 7 and 8 do much to avoid placing this unusual phenomenon in its proper perspective.

Our case files for 1965 were reviewed for sightings from the San Francisco-Oakland metropolitan area and the adjoining Moffett Air Force Base. These reports originated from Vallejo, Concord, Antioch, Walnut Creek, Santa Clara and the surrounding areas. They were evaluated as satellites and various observations of celestial and other phenomena.

Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for evaluation of their authenticity and origin. Permission to use these prints and pictures must be obtained from the Chief, Aerospace Audio-Visual Service, Norton Air Force Base. Certain techniques of analysis have been identified as means of determining the nature of various objects.

Thank you for your letter and for your interest in Air Force matters.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division

Request for UFO Information,

TO: HQ USAF/SPTD (Mrs Hunt)
WASH D C 20330

The enclosed report is forwarded for your information. The following is a suggested reply:

The enclosed fact sheet is provided as general information on the results of Project Blue Book. This document contains the results of our investigations since its inception in 1947.

On Oct 7 and Oct 8 do much toward piecing this unusual phenomenon. The results were not of a nature to be of interest to the general public. Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for analysis. These reports and those received from Hamilton Air Force Base during the period 1 May to 30 Aug 55, compiled and evaluated. The cumulative data was such as to establish the existence of this aerial phenomena and various observations of stars and planets. These sightings, and Venus were the major astronomical bodies observed.

Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for technical analysis. When permission is obtained, these prints and pictures may be used for briefings. As of this date, no photographs have been submitted that have passed the careful technical analysis. Unidentified targets, such as balloons, stars, et cetera, which include lights, objects, reflections, etc., witnessed in the camera, film, aerial photography, and telescope images, are recorded in the files. Since the Air Force never claims a case solved unless the evidence clearly and unmistakably discloses the identity of the object, the name is regarded in the field of public domain and can be used in accordance with UFO reports.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping reporting on a sighting of a "flying object" in the Sunnyvale, California area. The text of the newspaper clipping is as follows:

Balloon, Or?
Under "The Saga of Flying Objects:"
Scene: The office of a Napa Medical Group doctor on Lincoln Avenue. The time is 3 p.m. Wednesday.
Action: Dennis Dwelly, 6, is about to have the doctor's office told that his grandmother when the physician reports to administer the child's medicine.
"Dennis," says the doctor, "I'll hold it for you in a minute. Look at that thing outside in the sky. What is that?"
A glowing white object, elongated in shape, is floating in the sky. It seems to be divided in two parts, one end and white on the other.
Dennis walks out and looks at the strange object, lets go of the doctor's hand and lets go of the balloon.
Grandma: "Look, the atmosphere certainly makes the balloon way up there look weird. It's floating up and down, isn't it Callicga?"
Dennis: "Sttangra."
Scene: Near a home in the Bel Air section. The time is about 3 p.m. Wednesday.
Action: Housewife and others see what they call a strange flying object at about 3 p.m. Wednesday. It is elongated in shape, about 25 to 30 feet long, and silver and white on one end and white on the other end, and had no wings, although the flying object might have come from outer space because it made no sound, indicating it could be powered by antigrivity force.
Action: Voice at the Napa Register office Friday morning.
Action: Voice that does not wish to be identified says the flying object without wings, that made no noise, silver-colored, and was fixed on one end. 
Voice states the object coming south from California, veered over Los Angeles area, then south in direction of Napa County Air Port.
Problem: Was there any connection between the sighting Wednesday at Lincoln Avenue and the sighting Wednesday at Bel Air section. Did some other youngster go to the doctor yesterday? Or, are the incidents absolutely unrelated? No one seems to know for certain, but there are no other explanations at this time.

The image appears to be the front page of a newspaper called "South Bay Daily Breeze". It contains a photograph showing two people, likely a man and a woman, sitting in a bathtub. The caption below the image reads "The Sky Is Full of Mysteries" and mentions a photograph of a "strange object" in the sky, suggesting the newspaper is reporting on a UFO-related story.

TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT:

The sky is full of mysteries
Gary Gillis, Daily Breeze photographer, "This photograph didn't see the object until he printed the negative. The strange object it was just above the heads of two girls in a routine pic."

- page 13 -

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a part of a UFO report document. The photograph shows two blurry images of what seems to be an unidentified aerial phenomenon in the sky over the South Bay region. The text accompanying the photograph describes the event as a "UFO Crossing South Bay Skies?" and mentions a "Routine Photo, Then... A Bright Spot Appears" during the shooting of the pictures.

UFO Crossing South Bay Skies?
Routine Photo, Then... 
A Bright Spot Appears

It was developing these negatives from a shooting assignment in Sunnyvale, California, when the photographer Gary Gillis said "a bright spot showed up" while shooting the pictures, and that this "knowledge would make the above image." The picture was taken with a series camera at 1/250th of a second, and the text mentions the names of Toni Villani and Carol Weston, who were present during the incident.

FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
Regular Meeting -- First Friday of each month -- 8:30 P.M.
November 5, 1965 -- Central Y.M.C.A. on Center & Downey Streets - Alconoy.

Several sightings have been reported to FSIC during the month of October. Investigation is continuing to come in relation to these sightings, and the committee has continued its field investigations. Allyn Wade reported on his investigation of the sighting and getting of a photograph of a U.F.O. taken in Poway County, Calif., on August 8th, 1965. This photo is shown & discussed with a diagran to its trail which was not visible on the first film. The picture shows a clear outline of an object discernible against the background.

DAYLIGHT SIGHTING
Daylight sighting was made by two employees of Columbia Chemical of California. Distributing Chems Co., in Sunnyvale, during the day was clear and mild. Gerald Rugent and Ernest Kasevic were working outdoors on their assigned to adjust a high-intensity jet used for welding a home under construction. A few moments later, as they crossed a part of the field, Rugent pointed to a silver disc consideration larger than the jet, which turned them to observe. It was hovering at an estimated elevation of 200 feet.

Kasevic didn't see it immediately but when both men saw it, they observed that it was about 30 feet in diameter and about 10 feet thick, metallic silver-gray in color, and edge appeared smooth with no visible openings or controls. It came out of a northerly direction and approached until it took a position directly over the jet. It remained, hovering silently for about 2-3 minutes. Suddenly, after the elapsed time, it made a sharp 90 degree turn to the east and accelerated at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a few seconds.

On August 11, 1959 at 6:30 P.M. Gary Toll reported seeing a clearly defined, round object with a metallic silver color. It came from the west and took only 3 seconds to move from an elevation of 30 degrees to horizon. It gave off an intense blue-white light and later was noted to have emitted a trail of blue-white flame.

On July 19, 1965, at 2:00 P.M., Joseph Restak was driving on Drank St., near Cole's Flower Lane. The day was clear and cool, with a few clouds. Through his windshield he saw a silver, metallic-like object hovering very low and emitting a hissing sound. This object estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter. It remained hovering for a short time and then accelerated straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared, leaving no trail.

Le Monde (Life of October 11, 1965)
Around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, October 9th, several people, including a machine in the shape of a man, saw in the sky over Touryal, a saucer-shaped object moving at a great height.
One of the witnesses explained that he was looking at his office, he had seen the object in the sky, and had immediately called them, and they all saw the saucer.
"It is impossible to say for certain whether an aircraft or not," he explained. We were unable to see it with the naked eye, and the question of its being an aircraft," he explained, "was at a great height." The flying saucer remained several hours, and the other side was black. Then, as a disk, it split, the machine went on his way.

On October 12th several Connecticut newspapers published a UFO photo taken at Sunnyvale, California. The boy was doing schoolwork when he heard a humming sound which Rogers Litchfield, an electronics technician, says was coming from a high pitch, round object. It was followed by a thin disc which rose rapidly upwards into the sky where it disappeared, and that it was traveling about 700 miles per hour.

It was a rather slender climbing straight up to a

The like suddenly disappear with fantastic speed and

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing handwritten text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output the text found in the document:

This was a lighted strip running along the length of the object. The strip was a sort of reddish-orange light and didn't flash. The flashing lights started at about 2 o'clock and went completely around the object. The 2 of us were about 125 yards from this object at the time. These lights flashed around like some of the particles you see when you have a static electricity charge built up in your body. The object then started moving slowly to the right, and we saw -- I don't know what it was.

As it moved, it seemed much larger. It had a definite shape - a long oval or cigar shape, and the lights ran around the whole length of it. If it had been any kind of airplane, I never saw any wings or tail. 

The lights on the strip and the flashing lights were all bright and steady. There was no blinking or flickering. The lights were around the whole circumference of the object. We watched it move slowly to the right, then it stopped and hovered, and was motionless for a few minutes. Then it began moving slowly again to the left, and we kept watching it until it went out of sight behind some trees. We never saw any wings or tail, and never saw any kind of control surfaces.

It was quite large - about the size of a four-engine airplane, though not as high. At first I thought it might be a helicopter, but there was no sound at all, and no rotor blades. It just floated along silently. When it stopped and hovered, it seemed to be at an altitude of about 1000 feet. I would judge the speed when it was moving to be around 200 to 300 mph. It was a clear night, no clouds, and we had a good view of the object. 

I am quite certain that this was not any kind of conventional aircraft. The lights and general appearance ruled that out completely. I felt that what we saw was something highly unusual and not of this world. However, we're afraid to report it.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

This thing because the great discrepancies between the stories. 2 military officers claimed to have seen a strong maneuverable object go across the sky and took notes as soon as we got home to talk about it, we was unable to say Just what we saw. 

As we did see something, and it's amazing. 

There were about 12 other people who saw the same thing. I was called the manager's report; the phone operator took the call and sent it up through normal channels. Of course as we were all interested, we asked the men if they considered calling the authorities and they said no, they didn't want to because if they did, they were certain the authorities would come and want to do things to them or the campus and they didn't want that.

A larger thing disappeared behind the trees, the hill behind couldn't be seen and to the college men who saw it would say that they saw a large dark shape with a glowing rim, come up rapidly over the horizon and seem to pause, then it angled towards the east in a very smooth fashion and was gone. We saw it follow the same path on the return trip it made a much softer maneuver, maintaining the same speed and glided back across the horizon. 

For the things in hopes (?) that will come again. We're all so startled that we'd prefer it didn't happen again. But in the interest of science....

Sunday days and I saw a peculiar things. The student was sitting on the bench in the arboretum when I happened by, and nothing unusual to report other than I told him I thought I saw something in the sky, then just stood still there for as long as we were standing there. 

Other than being very shocked, we're all just a little bit puzzled. Could you please find out someone who knows more about these things - well, carry our investigation.

Much love, Jane!

Oct 25,1965

Dear folks,  
The incident which occurred on Friday evening is not fully understood and requires additional investigation on our part. I will summarize the details which have come to my attention so far:

On the evening of September 3, 1965, a man residing in Sunnyvale, California, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 50 to 100 feet in diameter, and emitting a red glow. It was observed for several minutes before it rapidly climbed into the sky and disappeared. 

Later that night, the same witness reported hearing a loud explosion or sonic boom. Immediately following this, his home and the surrounding area experienced a brief power failure lasting approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

The witness also reported that over the next several days, he and his family experienced unusual physical symptoms, including nausea, headaches, and a tingling sensation across their bodies. Additionally, a small burn mark was found on the witness's arm that he could not account for.

We are continuing to investigate this incident and are attempting to gather any additional information that may be relevant. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can provide.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Gentlemen:
What is the truth about unidentified flying objects? This information, if true, is so important to mankind. Also is it true that two space visitors were found, geographically perfect and Indian in features, west of
a mystic and a grand race spotted here that are not from this planet. We are certain of this because we observed them through our help of motion picture and television.
Yesterday evening at 11:12 I observed three moving slowly towards the east, moving slowly across the sky.
Thank you."

Transcription of the text found in the document:

PROJECT SUMMARY REPORT
EXG REPORT: 26/8/65

NAME-ID: Many unidentified triangular objects
LOCATION: Sunnyvale, California

PRECIS: On the night of 26 August 1965, a number of triangular shaped objects were observed by several witnesses over the Sunnyvale, California area. The objects were observed between 2130 and 2300 hours. The objects were reported to be approximately 100-150 feet in length, and were seen to hover and maneuver at a high rate of speed. The objects were observed by two separate groups of witnesses, and were reported to the USAF.

FOLLOW UP COMMENT:
BACKGROUND:
The witness, a military officer, stated that he and several other persons observed a triangular object over the Sunnyvale area on the night of 26 August 1965. The object was estimated to be approximately 100-150 feet in length, and was observed to hover and then accelerate at a high rate of speed to the northeast. The witness stated that the object was brightly illuminated, and that it displayed red, green, and white lights. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes.

CONCLUSION: Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and origin of the triangular objects observed over Sunnyvale, California on the night of 26 August 1965. This case remains UNRESOLVED.

NAME: WALLACE H. ESSAGHIAN JR.
ADDRESS: 1058 Mary Avenue, Sunnyvale, California
OCCUPATION: Engineer (Aerospace, Astronautical Engineering)

REMARKS: 
On January 1, 1965, at 4:20 PM PDT, the witness, while outside his home, observed a very bright object traveling in the sky from the north towards the southwest. The witness stated that the object was "much brighter than any normal aircraft." The witness further stated that the object was round in shape and appeared to be self-luminous. The witness observed the object for approximately 45-50 seconds until it disappeared from view behind some trees.

WEATHER ACCOUNT:
The witness stated that the weather conditions at the time of the sighting were clear with no clouds in the sky.

OTHER DETAILS:
The witness is described as a reliable observer who has considerable knowledge of aerospace engineering and who has an intense interest in astronomy and UFOs. His description of the object appears to be consistent with a sighting of a UFO. No other observers are known to have seen the object.
