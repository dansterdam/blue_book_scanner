Southing, Connecticut
2 Oct 65

SAUCER LANDING IN CONNECTICUT: Just before press time, we learned of a sensational incident that occurred on the nights of October 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in Southington, Conn. A local youth named Ronald Rubenstein saw a UFO low over his car on Chase Drive consecutively evenings. On one night it was hovering only 50 feet above him. He described it as being 2½ car lengths in diameter, and 3½ car lengths long. It had a "corrugated bottom," and numerous lights.

Incidentally, four "pothole lights" on the dome. After several seconds it swooped away and landed on a high hill about a mile away.

A search of the hill by news reporters a few days later disclosed a charred area on a ridge overlooking the countryside. Rubenstein took a picture on one occasion, but it shows only a white spot at some distance from the camera, against the night sky.

South America
4 October 65

Throughout October, November, and December, dozens of UFO incidents continued to occur throughout South America, especially in Argentina. Among the most startling was an incident reported on October 4th, concerning three children who claimed they were almost abducted by small humanoid creatures while on their way to school. This occurred in Salta. A similar incident took place at about the same time in Santiago del Este, where a gigantic creature disappeared "enveloped in a cloud of dirt" before the eyes of several children who had gone to get water from a dam. In neither of these cases was a flying saucer seen, according to our information.

Mrs Hunt/ah/SAFOTCC/7284c/11 Jan 66

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

I apologize for the delay in answering your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

I am enclosing a copy of the report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFD project. This report contains information on our project since its origin in 1948.

Articles such as those published by you in the Napa Register on October 7 and 3 do much toward placing this unusual phenomenon in its proper perspective.

Our case files for 1965 were screened for sightings from the San Francisco area. Multiple reports were received from Hamilton Air Force Base. These reports originated from Walnut Creek, San Rafael, San Francisco, Pleasant Hill, and the surrounding areas. Many were evaluated as satellites and various observations of stars and planets.

Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for evaluation only. The original negatives and prints are returned to the owners. Permission to use these prints and pictures must be obtained from the owners. As of 31 July, the objects in photographs which have been submitted to the Air Force for evaluation have been identified as known natural or conventional objects such as aircraft, balloons, stars and planets, lens flares, emulsion flaws, light cracks in the camera, and reflections.

Thank you for your letter and for your interest in Air Force matters.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING

            a.  Dear Sir:

            The enclosed fact sheet is provided as general information
            on the results of Project Blue Book. This brochure explains the
            success of our investigations since its inception in 1947.

            Aug 65. These reports were from Walnut Creek, San Rafael, San
            Francisco, Pleasant Hill and the surrounding area and were evaluated as a realistic and various observations of stars and planets.
            Mars, Arcturus, and Venus were the major astronomical objects
            observed.

            Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for
            evaluation only. The original negatives and prints are returned
            to the owners. Permission to use these prints and pictures must

            have been submitted to the Air Force which have not been identified as known or conventional objects such as aircraft, balloons, stars,
            etc. Also, evaluations include lens flares, emulsion flares, light
            crackle in the camera, reflections, etc. Names of UFO witnesses
            are not released by the Air Force. However, if the name of a
            witness is released through other sources such as newspapers, books,
            or magazine articles, the name is regarded in the field of public
            domain and can be used in association with UFO reports.

Balloon, Or?

Title: "The Saga of Flying Objects"
Scene: The office of a Napa Medical Group doctor on Lincoln Avenue. The time is 3 p.m. Wednesday.
Action: Dennis Roberts, 6, is about to leave the doctor's office with his grandmother when the physician inwards him for submitting to medical ministrations by lauding the younger a large balloon filled with gas—red on one end and white on the other.

Dennis walks out on the street, lets go of grandma's hand and lets go of the balloon.

Grandma: "Look, the atmosphere certainly makes the balloon way up there look weird. It's floating over the Bel Air and up toward Calistoga!"

Dennis: "Shucks."

Scene: Near a home in the Bel Aire section. The time about 3 p.m. Wednesday.

Actually, Mouser and others see what they can hardly believe—a revolving flying object at about 3,000 feet located for Calistoga. The oblong object was red on one end and white on the other end, and had no wings.

Some thought the flying object might have come from outer space because it made no sound, indicating it could be powered by magnetic force.

Scene: The Napa Register office Friday morning.
Action: Voice that does not wish to be identified reports Thursday between 3 and 5:30 p.m. saw an oblong object without wings, that made no noise, silver or colored, and was red on end.

Voice states the object coming south from Calistoga, toward over Las Animas area then south in direction of Napa County Airport.

Problem: Was there any connection between the visit to the doctor's office and the sighting Wednesday?

Or, are the incidents absolutely unrelated? No one seems to know for certain, but there are no other explanations at this time.

Flying Object Seen In Area

A flying object "that had to be from outer space" was sighted over Napa about 3 p.m. yesterday a housewife and a television repairman who is also a pilot.

Wesley Mouser, owner of the Television Center, 1601 Lincoln Ave., was repairing a set at a home in the Bel Aire section of Napa when a woman called him outside to verify what she could hardly believe.

Mouser said the silver object was traveling north toward Calistoga at about 3,000 feet. He estimated its speed at between 350 and 500 miles per hour. The wingless craft was roughly about 15 or 20 feet long and oblong in shape, he said.

The choice in Mouser's belief that the unidentified flying object was from another planet was the fact that there was no sound.

"This means it must have been propelled by magnetic force," Mouser reasoned. "It couldn't have been jet or gas powered, and we can't propel aircraft by magnetic force."

"It had to come from some place and it was not made here on earth," he concluded.

The woman did not think what he saw was a military craft. He did not see any lettering on the body of the object.

The woman who got the first look at the UFO, said the saucer was revolving, and that one end was red and the other end white.

She reported the incident to The Napa Register and the police department, but asked that she not be identified.

THE ONLY DAILY NEWSPAPER IN THE SOUTH BAY AREA

The Sky is Full of Mysteries

Gary Gillis, Daily Breeze photographer, didn't see the object until he printed the photo, but there it was just above the heads of two girls in a routine picture. The bottom photo is a blown-up section of the sky showing the strange object. Is it a flying saucer?

UFO Crossing
South Bay Skies?
Routine Photo, Then...
A Bright Spot Appears

"I was developing these negatives from a shooting assignment in Lomita," Breeze photographer Gary Gillis said, "and it showed up on the negatives."

"What showed up?"

"At the risk of sounding foolish, it looks kind of strange-shaped."

"Whatever Gillis picked up in the picture is shown above, for you to decide for yourself."

The photographer said he saw nothing while shooting the pictures, and that to his knowledge no fluke in the developing process was made. "We don't leave the angle none."

The picture was shot with a twin lens reflex camera at 1/250th of a second at f/16.

Is it a bird, a plane, or...?
We don't know.

Oh, by the way, the girls are (from left) Trina Sagers, Toni Gray, Evelyn Rodriguez, Toni Villani and Carol Weston. All are contestants in the Miss Lomita-Harbor City Beauty Pageant.

FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE

Regular Meeting --First Friday of each Month --- 8:30 P.M.
November 5, 1959 --- Central Y.M.C.A. on Center & Bowery Streets - Akron,O.

SIGHTINGS

Several sightings have been reported to F S I C during the month of October. Information is continuing to come in relation to the summer sightings, and the reports have continued into the fall month.

M.C.A.P. investigators in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area have completed an investigation of a photograph of a U.F.O. taken in Beaver County, Pa., on August 8th. It's a night photo; it shows a disc-like object with a tapering trail which extends down toward the trees over which it maneuvered. The trail was not visible to the two witnesses. The picture was declared genuine by three professional photographers. The picture was taken from an estimated one-fourth-mile...........

DAYLIGHT

Locally, a daylight sighting was made by two employees of Columbia Chemical of Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. in Barberton,O. ( 16th St.)

The time was 10:45 A.M. on Friday, the 23rd of October, 1959. The day was clear and mild. Gerald Lucart and Ernest Krasovic were working outdoors in the yard. They stopped to admire a high-flying jet that was trailing a long vapor trail.

A few moments later, as they crossed a part of the field, Lucart pointed to a place considerably lower than the jet-trail and asked Krasovic what it was he was seeing. Krasovic didn't see it immediately but then both men were observing a clearly outlined, very shiny bright, chrome-like ball. It came out of the north and approached until it was at a stationary position at an elevation of 20 degrees. It remained in that position from 11 to 15 seconds. It then changed shape and became a long narrow cigar-like object tapering from its middle to the rounded ends of the object. Suddenly at the elapsed time a fore-mentioned, it accelerated away in a matter of from 4 to 6 seconds. Lucart tried to alert holders some yards away but was apparently unsuccessful. It disappeared into the N.E. losing from view. Elevation in relation to the horizon. Around 11:30 A.M. both men related that the sky was full of vapor trails made by criss-crossing planes in the same area this object had been in. This was also verified by other alert watchers in the Akron area. This lasted until 3:00 P.M.

Both men declared that a camera would have recorded a picture. An estimate at altitude by Lucart was 8,000 feet. Krasovic estimated its distance at 3 to 10 miles.

The object's intense brilliance did not change during the shape-changing maneuver. Both were at a loss to explain its stationary position, its meteorological, its lack of coordinated features, and its extreme reflectivity or luminosity. No sound, trail etc. was noted. No details marred its smooth surface.

On August 11, 1959 at 6:50 P.M. Gary Telz reported seeing a clearly outlined object he could not identify. It had a dull silver color. It came from the area of the sun and took only 8 seconds to move from an elevation of 30 degrees to a position almost overhead. He was driving on East Ave. near Battle Ave. Its path was generally S.W. to N.E....

On July 18, 1959, at 2:00 P.M., Joseph Braclet was driving M. on Brown St. near Cole & Towers Lane. The day was clear and cool with a few clouds. Through his windshield he saw anyway, round object. The sky was "like a dull haze." While a dull haze, Braclet stopped his car, got out, but there was nothing there to see.

Looping UFO

Le Monde Libre of October 11, 1965
carried the following account:
"Shortly before mid-day on Saturday
(October 9), a machine in the shape
of a plate was seen in the sky over
Tours (Indre et Loire) by four
persons.

"One of the witnesses explained
that as he was leaving his office, he
had seen the object in the sky, and
had immediately called three of his
colleagues who, like himself, watched
it maneuver.

"It is impossible to say how surprised we were, for never for a solitary
instant did we think there was any
question of its being an aircraft" he
explained. "We were unable to see
more than a point in the sky, for it
was at a great height. The flying
saucer executed several loops, and we
saw that one side was silvery and the
other side black. Then, at a dizzy
speed, the machine made off towards
the north.'"

Berlin, Connecticut
12 October 1965

On October 12th several Connecticut newspapers published a UFO photo taken at about 2:45 p.m. the previous day by a Berlin, Connecticut boy named Roger Labas. The boy was doing schoolwork when he heard a humming sound which later increased in intensity and became a high pitch. After spotting the fairly clear object, he rushed indoors for his camera, and took a strange-looking object, he rushed indoors again before the whirling craft climbed rapidly upwards into the sky and disappeared. The boy said that he saw things on it that looked like periscopes, and that it was traveling about 700 miles per hour.....

Carleton College
October 15, 1965

A bunch of us say the strangest thing last night. We've been trying to figure out what we saw. We were in the Air Force and we just want to help.

Sue and Dave and I had just left together about a quarter of six. We noticed the bridge and were on the lake admiring the bright star-like thing that was moving across the sky with its astro proj rays.

We turned left (to the SE) to take the road up to houses or a lake. This thing at about 5:50. It was right near us and actually it would be back a ways, even with the third floor up from the horizon.

At first it was very faintly blinking about 3 and light-very sharp and irregular. As we watched, the lights got much larger and brighter and more of them. Was this thing coming toward us? If it was, it was probably coming sideways, what we saw later was us thick. The lights were mainly red and white, two one and one 2 or 3 green flashes. At first, Dave said, "I have a slight green color blindness."

The lights all the time we watched it were never like plane lights. Plane lights are soft and fuzzy, sort of, but you can easily pick out the 3 or 4 lights. These lights were very bright and glaring, sort of like a lighted O.C. which plane lights do, and not have the intensity of burning magnesium. The flashes in all different places on this thing in all sorts of combinations and very regularly and very rapidly.

Then the thing headed north until it was over the top or the farm behind the arb. Then it seemed to turn and move around. After it got partway to Goodhue, it seemed to drop lower and start moving faster.

At the time when it turned west, we began to see a dark shape behind the lights. When it appeared to drop in altitude and speed up, we saw the shape definitely. It was clear-cut against the sky. Different shapes would have looked like that at that moment.

It was flying just above the treetops. Just before it were a taller tree, the main blinking lights seemed to be on the craft. It came from behind the tree. Most of the flashing lights were around the front end. Its shape was even more definite at that point.


- page 19 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

p. 2

We picked up a lighted strip running along the length of the craft. This was a sort, reddish-orange light and didn't flash. We saw this strip of light, the flashing lights started all over it, making it hard to watch. The 3 of us present were trying to string of this strip of light -- portholes?-- and we were watching a light. I saw ---- because were "3's" too and we saw ----

(lower is it moved west. Finally, it reached water tower at the second crossing - about a half and trees) - disappeared behind 2 tall trees. This happened at about the same time, of course, didn't agree, so the whole thing was a few minutes.

There was no sound at all during any of this, and it was the last thing any of us would have carried perfectly. No plane would be around now, of course, as we never saw any wings either.

In the following minutes around the water tower it seemed to settle a bit, was about a half mile and was moving about the ground a bit. Half way, moves as it's coming in for a landing. I remember it was just about 10 minutes, because I positioned that plane away coming to bar a landing at the Minneapolis International Airport. But no ordinary plane would fly so low, such large as that distance. If this thing was big and was coming over the airport north of town, and they said the plane in the area had landed at 5:30 - 20 minutes from the thing we can determine from this, the area where this thing disappeared is too far to determine a private airstrip.

I was in the Ground Observer Corps, and he says he's seen a case of plane lights that looked and acted like this.

Suppose another possibility might be that it's a weather balloon. But, no, I'm blinking to that place that produced this. But do weather balloons have flashing lights and something like portholes?

The thing with us were 2 from girls. Unfortunately, we learned that their reports of the thing are completely confused. They claim that this thing took 20 minutes to travel over the trees. We have it exactly how long we watched the thing, but it was under 10 minutes. We're afraid to report.


- page 20 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

this thing because the great discrepancies between the stories
2 panic-stricken freshmen and the 3 of us, who stayed remarkably
calm and took notes as soon as we were not able of sleep, will probably
cause the whole thing to be discredited.

But we did see something, and let's something we are of
has ever seen before.

There were about 15 other people who saw the thing, in one
these 2 girls strayed around for the whole night, and in their
homes. Everyone else glanced at it, said "how unusual" and went
dinner.

We called the Northfield airport; the phone operator tried
to get us through to the Minneapolis airport but couldn't - we're
going to try them again today to see if they have flight radar
anything going over this area. We called the local civil defense
people, but if they were interested, they sure didn't know it;
guess they have to prevent panic. We may contact Fort Collins
the Cities airport says no plane was around here. We had written
to her dad to see if he has any contacts that might be useful
to us.

After the thing disappeared behind the trees, we went up
the hill behind Goodhue and to the college that was across. We
we got to the top right in the area where the thing disappeared, we
saw a huge dark space with lights in a field behind some bushes. Parked
out we saw a craft in an old field - a large - a large craft with
itself. But the combine and tractor weren't what we saw. Gliding
across the sky. We walked quite a ways down the highway looking
for the thing or a landing strip, but no luck, so we went back to
the campus and started making phone calls.

Tonight we're going to be out there with camera and binoculars
for a long time in hopes (??} that it will come again. I think
we're all so scared that we'd prefer it doesn't come again, but
in the interests of science...

Sunday Day and I saw 3 unusual things. Two were white,
bright white, blinked with moving movements. The third was a
in midair. The third was bright white, round half way up in the
sky, then just stood still there for as long as we were there.
excitement!

Other than being very shock, we're all ok. We
come back and. Could you please send a psychology of this
to us? And do you think we should notify someone? They not
run to class now. Don't worry about us - we'll be alright, nothing
these things - we'll carry our watch.

Much love, Carol

Dear folks,

Hi! How are y'all, besides busy? I'm feeling...

[Several lines are blacked out/redacted]

My classes are going well and are very interesting. I'm working on a title: Some military on Sabotage histories. After that we start the comedies. In yagel we're studying framing and language, which is cool. Still taking my yagel 10 final in a week. Rosh, rosh!

Were and I'm in the air over our UFO. Was it so sure it's still unidentified. Significant maybe they were testing on the 13th and 15th with the 14th.

Problem: The Air Force says they have been flying Q-119's around, watching it at a height of 250-300 feet. Question: could you fly a Q-119 with out a tail but at that height? Q-119, some says, is one of those funny things.

Would Sir Hayek be able to tell you of a place in such condition that is fitting around at that height and could be find out if one of them definitely flew over the NE corner of Northfield? If what we saw was just a Q-119, I don't want to write Sir Hayek to an area with the questionnaire. Would he be willing to investigate the possibility of our thing being a plane?

Gentlemen:

What is the truth about unidentified flying objects? Are they interplanetary, intergalactic? Also is it true that two space vehicles were found, geometrically perfect and enclosed in two war men.

I, myself, and a friend have spotted three that are not from this planet. We are certain of this because we observed them through the help of my 175X refractor telescope.

Yesterday, October 15, a shiny object was spotted moving slowly straight, etc. Also previously, at night, moving slowly across the sky.

Thank you,

(Observer, Writer Astronomer)
