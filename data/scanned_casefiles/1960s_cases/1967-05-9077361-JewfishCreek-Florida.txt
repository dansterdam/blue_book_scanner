10. CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT
No data presented to indicate object could not have been an A/C

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object was as long as a blimp but not quite as thick. Metallic or silvery color. The bright light from the object first attracted the observer's attention. Object was in the SE then turned to due North and was on this course for about 8 minutes, then it turned East and disappeared below horizon after about 2 minutes. In this direction, all turns the object made were gradual.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

[The rest of the text appears to be a handwritten narrative description of a sighting, which includes details about a location, direction, and observations. However, due to the handwritten nature, some words are difficult to discern with complete certainty. The text describes movement, direction (north, west), and seems to be a detailed account of an unusual aerial observation.]

The handwriting is somewhat challenging to read in its entirety, but it appears to be a detailed first-person account of a UFO or unusual aerial phenomenon sighting.
