PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 15/1038Z
2. LOCATION: CRAIG AFB, ALABAMA
3. SOURCE: MILITARY
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: ONE
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: [blank]
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: [blank]
7. COURSE: STATIONARY
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: OTHER ROCKET LAUNCH

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Approximately 20 Flight line personnel sighted a white light that seemed to be emitting blue-green waves. These waves got larger as the waves progressed outward similar to water ripples caused by a rock in a pond. The light was observed at approximately 2 to 5 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of 115 to 125 degrees from true north. The light remained in relatively the same position and after about three minutes suddenly blinked out.

COMMENTS: The sighting was almost undoubtedly caused by a rocket launch from Cape Kennedy.

1.    Reference your letter of 30 August 1968, subject as above.

2.    There was a launch from Cape Kennedy at the time the aerial phenomena occurred. It was the first Poseidon launch, and appeared very much as it was sighted from Craig AFB. At the altitude at which the phenomena occurred the Project Office advises that a 600 NM horizon is reasonable. The time of the sighting would have had to be several minutes before the time you established the sighting, however.

UFO Observation, 16 August 1968

Public Information Office (AFSC)
Cape Kennedy AFB

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report that occurred at Craig AFB, Alabama on 15 August 1968 at 0538 CDT, 1030Z.

2. Approximately 20 flight line personnel sighted a white light that seemed to be emitting blue-green waves, "these waves got larger as the waves progressed outward, similar to water ripples caused by a rock in a pond. The light was observed at approximately 2 to 5 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of 115 to 125 degrees from true north. The light remained in relatively the same position and after about three minutes suddenly blinked out.

3. We understand that you had a rocket launch at 1030Z. We would like to know if you definitely did have a rocket launch at this time, if it could appear similar to the description given by the observers, and if you feel that it could have been observed from Craig AFB (420 nautical miles away).

4. Thank you for your assistance, it is appreciated.

J. THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT FLIGHTS WHICH MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THIS PHENOMENON. THERE WERE NO WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHES.

TEN TO TWENTY CRAIG FLIGHT LINE PERSONNEL WITNESSED THE LIGHT PHENOMENON. ALL THE WITNESSES DESCRIBE THE LIGHT AS A BRIGHT ROUND DISK SURROUNDED BY EMITTING WAVES. AFTER APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES, THE LIGHT WENT OUT. THE ANGLE OF ELEVATION (APRX 2 DEG), AZIMUTH (APRX 120 DEG) AND MOVEMENT (NONE) ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT AMONG THE WITNESSES. UNFORTUNATELY CRAIG'S CONTROL TOWER AND RADAR FACILITY WERE NOT MANNED AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ALSO, NEITHER MAXWELL AFB NOR CRAIG AFB HAD LAUNCHED ANY WEATHER BALLOONS. HOWEVER,

AT 2530 LOCAL (1930 GMT) ROCKET LAUNCH AT CAPE KENNEDY COULD EXPLAIN
THE LIGHT. THE BEARING TO CAPE KENNEDY (120 DEG), THE TYPE OF
LIGHT EMISSIONS, AND THE APPEARANCE OF NO MOVEMENT CAN BE LOGICALLY
EXPLAINED BY THE ROCKET. THE ONLY UNACCOUNTED FACT IS THE DISTANCE
TO CAPE KENNEDY (420 NAUTICAL MILES). IT IS MY CONCLUSION THAT THE

LIGHT PHENOMENON WAS IN FACT THE ROCKET LAUNCH AT CAPE KENNEDY.
