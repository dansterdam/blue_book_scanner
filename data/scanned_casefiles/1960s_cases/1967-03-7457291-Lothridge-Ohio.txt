Anyway I will make this whole story up
for publicity or anything of the sort. It's
quite true and the only reason I'm filling
out this form is because the UFO shot
I saw was cube shaped, although while
spinning it did have a "saucer-like"
shape. I thought maybe it would be
helpful, since I've never heard of any-
one sighting a cube shaped UFO
before.

Gentlemen,

I hesitated to write because of some of the explanations the Press Israel has been giving for UFO's. I just became interested in UFO's in the summer of 1966. I was out at a neighbors, it was late evening. As I was walking home I saw a "star" moving rapidly across the sky. All at once it just stopped in mid-air. When I got home I got the binoculars and watched it all evening. It was joined by another "star". I saw a train went east and it moved directly over the train and stayed there till the train was gone, then resumed its former position. I saw such UFO's on several nights that week. I observed through binoculars on one night as a jet was of pass-

word till the plane was past

In several occasions last summer
I saw flashing red lights. Actually
I thought they were planes but then
I looked through the binoculars what
I saw was not an airplane of any
sort. What I saw was a dark 0
object with a white light on top
and 2 red lights (one on each end).
It looked like it was about 30
feet long. I couldn't tell how wide
but it was definitely not round.
Each time it stopped (about once per
second) the red lights would seem to
blink but this was caused by the
U.F.O. turning as they were not
blinking. I saw this U.F.O. a
number of times last summer
always at tree-top level.

Then on March 9th, 1967 about
9:10 PM E.S.T. my husband and
I were driving down a country road

near his mother's house. I saw
a bright yellow-ish-red 'star'
seemed to be about 2 miles away.
We stopped to watch it. We
watched it for about 5 minutes
and it didn't move. We started to
leave when we saw another 2 I/O
on the opposite side of us about
300 feet away. It was orange-red
like a flame with a definite form.
It was huge.
I can't determine the size, it was so big.
It lighted up the whole area for about
a mile around us. It wasn't moving
at all.
However we forgot this U.S.O. be-
cause the "star" started moving
in our direction. It came toward
our car then when it got within
a half mile of us it had the
form of a "saucer". It was
greyish white and rather fuzzy
with no lights. I was spinning
or fast. I couldn't describe it.
At this point I got scared and

started screaming. I told my husband
to start the car. We drove to the
top of the grade (about 100 ft.) and
I told him to stop. I had calmed
down by then. The UFO then slowed
down by about 100 ft. from the car and
lights on it came on. It stopped
about 50 ft. from our car, in front
and to the right of us. It was
hovering about 35 to 40 feet off
the ground. I got a good look at
it and I knew we'd better get
out of there. I was almost hys-
terical. I was sure something
would happen to us. My husband
drove about 90 m.p.h. down the
narrow crooked road. I looked
up once and the UFO was
"dusty over us going right along
with us. When we reached the
end of the road we looked and
it was gone. My husband didn't
see it so well as I did because

Here is the OCR text from the document:

he was driving but he saw it
well enough to know it wasn't
anything from this Earth! We
never noticed what happened to
the fire-colored UFO because we
were scared to death of the other
me. I do know it was almost
as light as daylight outside and
what I saw I saw very clearly.
I'll try to describe it as best I
I can. It was charcoal gray
in color after it stopped, about
12 to 15 feet square. It was
a perfect cube with a round
dome on top. On each side
of the cube there was a large
porthole. (4 in all) On alternate
sides were brilliant red lights
and green lights. The lights were
giving off rays. They weren't
shining directly on us. Perhaps
this is why we could see it so well.


- page 9 -

Here is the text from the document:

I didn't see the bottom because it was slanted slightly forward as in the diagram. Its movement seemed to be effortless and made no noise that I could hear. The car windows were rolled up so there could have been a slight noise that I didn't hear but I would have heard if there had been much noise.

What we saw that night was not a swamp gas, nor a bird, not a balloon, and definitely not an air plane or helicopter. So please explain to me what it was if it wasn't from outer space.

I know you folks in Washington don't believe in UFOs, but this one was so far out. I'll take a lie-detector test and I'll swear on a stack of Bibles that it's the truth.

IDEN/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla)/70916/Jet/9 Oct 67)
UFO Observation of March 9, 1967

Mrs.
Longbottom, Ohio

1. We regret that because of the late date at which you reported your sighting a complete investigation could not be made. It is important that an individual report their sighting immediately to the nearest Air Force Base.

2. It is necessary to know if there was any air activity in the area that might have caused the sighting. However, the FAA destroys all air activity records after thirty days. We did find that there are several low level, high speed refueling routes in the areas.

3. Because we cannot make a comprehensive evaluation of your sighting, we felt it necessary to classify your report as Insufficient Data.

July 18th, 1967

The UFO was spinning to the right and when it stopped it slowed down very quickly. I have been reading books about UFO's ever since this experience so I've read about the theory that UFO's are propelled by some sort of anti-gravity force. I don't know much about gravity but I think the fact that it keeps spinning is proof that gravity had something to do with the rotating process. Maybe if the UFO had been in the southern hemi-sphere it would have been spinning to the left instead of to the right.

Maybe I'm completely wrong but I think this UFO used gravity in some way to propel itself. And maybe by spinning fast enough it can create its own
