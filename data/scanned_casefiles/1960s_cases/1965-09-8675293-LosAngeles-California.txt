UFO, 9 September 1965                                                16 September 1965

COMMENTS OF THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER:

Reference the three sightings of the UFO or light phenomena and the map which numerates directions and angles of sightings.

Allowing for discrepancies in observations attributed to untrained observers, it is believed that the three reports tend to be in fair agreement.

It is estimated that the phenomena was caused by a relatively small meteorite which was observed relatively at low altitude and short range, and that the individual observed the meteorite during the last few seconds of its life. Although this is not conclusive, the green color spot by the trail of the meteorite is given off by a ferrous meteorite. No other logical explanation for the cause has been determined by the Investigating Officer.

A check was made with personnel at the Griffiths Park Observatory, and it was also their opinion that the phenomena as described could have been caused by a meteorite.

that a man,
Reno, Pennsylvania (Code 814 through Oil City)
and his wife had been painting a house when the object dropped near them.
It frightened them, and they left the scene, returning later to find
an object roughly the size and shape of a child's football. It is
apparently hollow with rubbery walls approximately 1/16 inch thick.
It was cracked, but all pieces were recovered. This is near Oil City,
Pennsylvania.
Mr reported this to the:
662 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron, Oakdale, Pennsylvania
and they are waiting to pick up this object for delivery to FTD if this
is desired. They are going to wait for a call from FTD.
MEMO FOR RECORD:
On 7 October Major Quintanilla went TDY to Pennsylvania and obtained the object
from Mr. Object was a gourd of some sort, not a meteor.

MEMORANDUM                                                15 September 1965

SUBJECT:    UFO, 9 September 1965
            Sighting "A"

TIME AND PLACE:    Between 2140 and 2145/
                   9 Sept 65, Los Angeles,
                   California

REPORTED BY:        Mr. [redacted], social
                    worker, Bureau of Public

Residence:          Los Angeles, California

Mr. [redacted] said he could testify to the time pretty accurately as he being between 9:40 and 9:45 PM, 9 September 1965, as he had been checking the time in his own interest just prior to the sighting.

He was on his scooter, riding at a speed of about 15 to 20 MPH on Lemon Grove Avenue, just off Normandy Ave., Los Angeles, and estimated the phenomenon at the time of the sighting was in a S.W. direction from him at about 80° in elevation (nearly straight up). He was attracted to the slight because the light pattern in the sky was like nothing else he had ever seen - it was pointed, like a bullet or elliptical shape with a radiation on the surface or trailing edges of the elliptical surface. He rode along for one or two seconds, looking at the phenomena. Then he looked down because he was on his scooter to see where he was going, and when he looked up again the light pattern had doubled in size, leaving him with the impression it had come quite near. In his estimation the light pattern had not changed shape. So he stopped the scooter, and when he looked up again, the thing was gone. Total elapsed time of both sightings was no more than five seconds.

Mr. [redacted] stated that the moon was full and clear. For Los Angeles, it was a clear night, especially when looking upwards.

Mr. [redacted] couldn't determine how far away the object was, how high, or its size. He said it looked very low down. At first it appeared about saucer size, and then changed to a size of about a dinner plate or serving plate which is larger than a dinner plate. The light looked like electrical house light.


- page 17 -

Mr [redacted] repeated the object was an elliptical shape, or bullet shaped. It moved from a distant position toward him and didn't move horizontally. He saw the object twice: once smaller and once larger. He interpreted the change in size as movement - skyward-groundward movement would be the direction.

                    County, Cal.

Residence:          [redacted], Los Angeles, California

Mr [redacted] said he could testify to the time pretty accurately as being between 9:40 and 9:45 PM, 9 September 1965, as he had been checking the time in his own interest. Just prior to the sighting, he was on his scooter, riding at a speed of about 15 to 20 MPH on Leonis Cross Avenue, just off Normandy Ave., Los Angeles, and estimated he was northwest of the phenomenon at the time of the sighting.

In was attracted to an eight because it was a symmetrical light pattern in the sky. The symmetry, the whole phenomena was in another class. He had never seen - it was pointed. Like a bullet or elliptical shape with a radiation on the surface or trailing edges of the elliptical surface. His first reaction was that it was probably back lighted from the moon. He rolled along looking at the phenomenon. He looked because of the unusual symmetry, a symmetry not ordinarily found in nature. Then he looked down because he was on his scooter to see where he was going, and then he looked up again. This pattern had doubled in size, leaving him with the impression it had some quite near. In his estimation, when the light pattern was on the horizon, it was normally - but because that undulates and changes quite rapidly because of the moon in the clouds, he did not believe this was what he had visually observed. So he stopped the scooter, and when he looked again, the thing was gone.

Mr [redacted] stated that the moon was full and clear, not behind billowing clouds. The moon was smooth from the ocean and hung like that. The haze was on the horizon and just faded into the stars and moon. In addition, he was very bright, very bright, very bright for in the city, and what appeared to be haze was on the horizon. He was near to the freeway, and is riding high there and doesn't obscure visibility. For Los Angeles, it was a clear night.


- page 19 -

Mr [redacted] couldn't determine how far away the object was, how high, or its size. He said it looked very low down. At first it appeared about saucer size, and then changed to a size of about a dinner plate or serving plate which is larger than a dinner plate.

The cloud, or phenomena, was light. The light looked like electrical light and could have been one or two things: light reflecting on a metal surface, or it looked like light itself, but he couldn't determine which.

Mr [redacted] suspected that the object was an elliptical shape, or bullet shaped. It moved from a distant position toward him and didn't move horizontally. Its size changed: once smaller and once larger. In its movement, the change in size was movement - skyward-groundward movement would be the direction.

Phoned in to Mr [redacted] at approximately 1005/10 September 1965.

Phoned in to FTD/NOSY(UFO), WPAFB, Ohio, to Sgt Moody. Was instructed to mail copy to that office.

Residence:

Mr. [redacted] and his wife [redacted] were visiting Mr. [redacted], an electrical engineer, North American Aviation Inc, Automatics Division, Anaheim, Calif., at the residence [redacted], May, Cypress, Calif. at the time of the sighting. They were on the point of departure when Mrs. [redacted] first sighted the alleged UFO while the three were standing in the front yard. She asked if that bright object were an airplane, then all looked. The object was about 30° to 400 above the horizon. All or a sudden they sighted the light, a fairly bright white-yellow light in the form of an elongated crescent. The trailing edges of the arc were to the north with the bottom of the arc or round side toward the direction of motion, or south. They first noticed the object to the NNW. At first the object appeared to move rather slowly, then seemed to speed up and then it disappeared. When last seen it was to the West.

Mr. [redacted] personally observed the alleged UFO for about seven seconds, his wife observed it a little longer time. Mr. [redacted] said he looked to see if it were landing lights, or some such, as he had spent four years in the U.S. Air Force and knew what landing lights and navigation lights were. But this light was not an aircraft light.

He said he had no way of telling how far away or at what altitude the object was. They watched the area where the light went out try to see if any airplane flashing lights or warning lights were present, but to the best of his knowledge he could not see any aircraft in the area at that time. Neither before nor after the light was extinguished did they hear any aircraft or see any aircraft lights. Mr. [redacted] said he had never seen anything like this before.


- page 21 -

It was not the moon, Mr [illegible] continued, because the moon was SSE position about time. The object was about the shape of an elongated quarter moon; it was much larger than the size of a star.

Mr [illegible] was contacted and his account of the sighting was essentially the same as that of Mr [illegible], except for the following:

a. He estimated the angle of elevation to be about 50° to 55°.

b. He observed the light for a much shorter period of time at an estimated 30° arc, azimuth about 290° to 250°.

c. He thought the light had gone out behind a cloud or thick haze.

Mr [redacted] and his wife [redacted] were visiting Mr. [redacted], an electrical engineer, North American Aviation, Inc. Automatic Division, Anaheim, Calif., at the time of the sighting. The Simone's were on the point of departure when Mrs. [redacted] first sighted the alleged UFO. While the three were standing in the front yard. She asked if that bright object were an airplane, then all looked. The object, some approximately due west moving from north to south about 30 to 40 above the horizon.

All of a sudden they sighted the light, a fairly bright white light in the form of an arc, an elongated arc. The trailing edges of the arc were to the north with the bottom of the arc or round side toward the south. It was moving in a southerly direction. As they first noticed the "arc" it was approximately NNW moving toward the south. At first the object appeared to move rather slowly, then seemed to speed up and then, "poof!" it disappeared.

Mr [redacted] personally observed the alleged UFO for about 10 seconds, his wife observed for a little longer. Mr [redacted] said he looked to see if it was landing lights, or some such. He has spent four years in the U.S. Air Force and knew what landing lights and navigation lights were. But this light was not an aircraft light.

He said he had no way of telling how far away or at what altitude the object was. They watched the area where the light went out to try to see if any airplane flashing lights or warning lights were present, but to the best of his knowledge he could not see any aircraft in the area at that time. Neither before nor after the light was extinguished did they hear any aircraft or see any aircraft lights. Mr. [redacted] said he had never seen anything like this before.

It was not the moon, Mr [redacted] continued, because the moon was SSE position about that time. The object was about the shape of a quarter moon but not really; it was rather sizeable but not the size of a star.


- page 24 -

Mr [redacted] said that in fact the first thing he thought of was that it was the moon only a little fatter, so he looked to see where the moon was and in looking, the moon was completely across the sky, but in relation to size it was similar to that, not dazzling but bright the same as the stars or something like that.

SUBJECT:    UFO, 9 September 1965
            Sighting "B"

TIME AND PLACE:    Between 2145 and 2200/
                   9 Sept 65, 

REPORTED BY:        Mrs. [redacted]

                    Torrance, Calif.
                    Tel: [redacted]

Mrs. [redacted] stated that between 9:45 and 10:00 PM 9 Sept 65, she, her husband, and a neighbor saw the object. The following is her description:

It was a real thick object shaped like a saucer and had a slight glow to it. It was observed at an estimated angle of elevation of about 40° to 50°. It was so "bright" out last night, no clouds in the sky, it was as clear as a bell.

It is hard to say how far away it was; it looked as though it was hovering, but moving toward them. It didn't change shape; it was just like a thick saucer. It had a real weird glow. The overall color was yellow like electrical house lights are yellow. The center section was a real pale green.

The object was to the west of where Mrs. [redacted] lives. It appeared at first to be hovering and then moving in a North to South direction when it suddenly went out of sight. (COMMENT: This slightly contradicts her statement that the object was also moving towards them.

However, Mrs. [redacted] states that both of her statements are correct.

TIME AND PLACE:    Between 2145 and 2200/
                   9 Sept 65, Torrance,
                   Los Angeles County, Calif.

REPORTED BY:        Mrs [redacted]
                    (Los Angeles County), 
                    Torrance, Calif.
                    Tel: [redacted]

Mrs [redacted] stated that between 9:45 and 10:00 PM, 9 Sept 65, she, her husband, and a neighbor (Torrance) saw the object. The following is her description:

It was a real thick object shaped like a saucer and had a slight glow to it, kind of gray, a real slight, pale glow and it looked like the outer rim - the glow was the light causing the outer edges to glow. It was there about three to four seconds from what they figured out.

It seemed at - like once they saw it, it left, whatever it was. It was so bright out last night, so clouds in the sky, it was a clear as a bell. Their first thought was that maybe it was plane with the vapor. But there was no plane, nothing. It was the weirdest thing.

It is hard to say how far away it was; it looked as though it was hovering, but moving toward them. Mrs. [redacted] said she was kind of amazed. It was something that she saw what she saw.

Mrs. [redacted] said she would say it was low in the sky compared to being high. It didn't change shape; it was just like a thick, thick saucer. She didn't see a dome on top, but it was like a saucer. It had a bright light on it, making the whole thing glow real weird. The light was a yellow like the electrical house lights are yellow. It was a real pale green from the time she saw it; she mainly was causing the yellow glow around the outer rim; only the middle showed up green. The color from the light made the outer rim of yellow glow, and they hadn't had a drink, she added. This was the first one she had ever seen.

The object was to the west of where Mrs [redacted] lives and appeared to be spinning south. It appeared at first to be hovering and then it completely spun out of sight. If it had been a plane or a missile that had blown up she would have seen it because she had seen some missiles blow up or gone up and this was something entirely different.


- page 27 -

Mrs [redacted] commented that her husband thinks this is stupid and doesn't believe in it, (meaning flying saucers and unidentified objects in general) and for him to think it could possibly seem to be a missile was crazy. She said that they stood out there for a long time afterwards to see whether it was a missile, but it was nothing like this. She saw movement towards to be controlled, like a missile running wild and blowing. She had seen such at Vanguard Missile Running, Calif., months ago.

Mrs [redacted] said she had waited until around 3:22 PM/10 Sept 69 to call because she had waited to see if there had been anything in the papers.

Call received by Mrs. Hofcammer.

h. Any Other Unusual Activity or Condition, Meteorological, Astronomical, or Otherwise, which might Account for the Sighting:

(1) I am told that a rocket was launched at Vandenberg AFB that night. I am positive that this sighting was not of a rocket or any component thereof nor was it a conventional aircraft or balloon.

It was a large metal sphere that was clear and distinct that appeared to be glowing from high speed in the atmosphere.

i. Interception or Identification Action Taken (such action may be taken whenever feasible, complying with existing air defense directives):

(1) None.

j. Location of any Air Traffic in the Area at Time of Sighting:

(1) I did not see any aircraft at that time although there normally is considerable civilian and military traffic in the area.

k. Position Title and Comments of the Preparing Officer, Including His Preliminary Analysis of the Possible Cause of the Sighting(s):

(1) Chief, Exploitation Branch, Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force (SAC). Subject report was received by this headquarters on 28 September 1965, eighteen days after the sighting. Due to the time element involved and the distance from the area, a "one-the-spot" survey was not conducted. A preliminary analysis of the report indicates the possibility that the sighting could have been a weather balloon, considering the sighting was in Tustin, California, near El Toro Marine Air Station.
