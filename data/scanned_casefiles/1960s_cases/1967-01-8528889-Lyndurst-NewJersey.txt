Dear Sir:

My letter of patience - information referring to OPERATION - BLUE BOOK does not seem to have been satisfactorily handled. About 8 months ago I reported a questionable sighting, and apparently nothing was done. I am concerned for additional info regarding my original report, and have still not received any mind regarding my ideas about the sighting.

Yours truly

Our satellite records show that on:

1-20-67 Echo II was going SE at 7:00 P.M. at 50° longitude 40° latitude
1-21-67 Echo I was going S at 5:21 P.M. at 310° longitude 40° latitude
1-29-67 Echo I was going NE at 9:51 P.M. at 70° longitude 40° latitude

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the characteristics of "Echo" satellites, which are 600 to 700 miles high and visible to the naked eye, though not as bright as the Echo satellites. The document also mentions that when photographing these satellites, the photographer should try a time exposure to improve the quality of the picture. Finally, the document is signed by James C. Manatt, Colonel, USAF, Director of Technology and Systems.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

3. The Echo satellites are 600 to 700 miles high and are quite bright. The Echo A satellite is about 3500 miles high and although it is not as bright as the Echo satellites, it is visible to the naked eye.

4. When photographing these satellites Mr. Manatt is bound to get just a point source of light. However, if he wishes to improve the quality of his picture he should try a time exposure.

5. We are returning Mr. ........'s photo to you. Because of the poor quality, we did not feel it was necessary to have any photo analysis done.

2. Major was personally interviewed by Major Ross, approximately 2 years ago. When the Base Operations Officer, Major sent photos he had taken at that time but were of the same quantity as the photos included so they were returned to him. There was no action taken at that time.

3. If you feel additional information is needed I shall be only too happy to help in any way possible.

Dear Sir -

While chasing the Light 3' above the water, I saw two others the going same way. When stopping, about half a mile up the shore, I reported to O.F.C. that was probably in the Linden area to move out as their timing. I was notified then I could leave and it. Since then I have received no notice of that matter again.

A few very men New York City - Queens mean the following: A white
object is not prcoveedty moved after. I think a very bright seen these it observe * can see for many miles with no obstractions.

First of all why do they appear at night must of the time - I always the same size - their brilliance? I believe they are flying fast enough to appear close - them - possible to distinct or retain a little as possible. This I now believe the object May very brightly then slowly dim out - very disappearance the affect I have - and thought a flight vehicles rather a fixed.

From the middle of July now August the (OVER)

Weather here has been very overcast, with no time
seem many of these objects in daylight as
raining weather. I believe they fly higher the usual
of the sighting are accidental, not
planned sightings, as there must have been
many more of them missed. To the east where the
weather cleared, I have been watching at
different times during the evening, but there not
many up there.

On the night of July 6, 1967 about 1:34 I had
a clear and unobstructed view of one of these objects.
It appeared to be hovering or going very slowly just
past my house. I have been trying to do so on over
and will continue it with interest. I have three
more pictures on another roll not yet developed, and
will hold same until I hear from you. On the side
of the 3x5 picture came out very good, the other
side had not come up as bright. I believe there are
the most ------ I have.

I will make another attempt to discribe the object.
I seen at the datacenter a insertion. 
At 10:23 am - I was driving to work on night
road my things on a road with a good view. Brilliantly
bright object about the size of a coin at arm's length
not making any unusual maneuvers. While watching, it
disappeared. I waited for traffic to stop. I could
not locate it further.

The text in the document is as follows:

The object, the object was observed by a building & went to the rear of the building, appeared to rise up, but it was no longer visible. 11/16/67, Dean Aden's object, 9 to 9:55 pm, moving southeast, 11:30/67, 10:55 E.S.T, 10:05 p.m., moving East-North-East, 11/21/67, 7:30 p.m. to 8:59 p.m., moving North-Northeast, 11/22/67, same, 7:30 p.m. to 8:59 p.m., moving North-Northeast. 4/15/67 (approx) List my name on this. Most important observation to date - Object appeared stationary at 9:27 to 9:28 p.m. I was sitting in my office, when the object appeared in the sky, and moved in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be a most brilliant white light, and seemed to be hovering, but I was unable to detect any shape or form to the object, apart from the brilliant white light which seemed to pulsate or flicker at times. The object remained stationary for about one minute. It then moved off at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction, and disappeared from sight. I cannot estimate the height at which the object was observed, but I can say that it was high enough above the horizon that I had to look up to see it. I got out of my car to observe the object, it was overhead, and I watched it disappear. I did not see any other aircraft, that I am aware of, in the vicinity at the time the object was observed.
