Attn: Colonel James G. McNath.

Dear Sir:

My letter & photos
were forwarded to you from McGuire
AFB & to make a long story short
I regret & apparently was mistaken.
Something someone recently
explained to me has changed my
mind regarding my ideas about
the object & decided it now
believe them to be satellites.

Yours truly,

1. Reference your letter pertaining to UFO Observation of Mr. Taylor.

2. We feel that Mr. [redacted] is viewing and photographing satellites.
He reports that:

1-20-67 Starlike object 7:00 to 7:10 P.M. moving SE
1-21-67 Starlike object 6:15 to 6:25 P.M. moving S
1-22-67 Starlike object 8:00 to 8:10 P.M. moving NE
1-23-67 Starlike object 7:00 to 7:55 P.M. moving E
6-21-67 Starlike object 11:00 to 11:10 P.M. moving NE
6-29-67 Starlike object 9:45 to 10:00 P.M. moving NE
7-5-67 Starlike object 10:00 to 10:15 P.M. moving S
7-5-67 Starlike object 10:45 to 11:00 P.M. moving E
7-6-67 Starlike object 11:05 to 11:15 P.M. moving SE
7-13-67 Starlike object 9:30 to 9:40 P.M. moving SE

Our satellite records show that on:

1-20-67 Echo II was going SE at 7:09 P.M. at 92° longitude 40° latitude
1-21-67 Echo II was going SE at 6:24 P.M. at 90° longitude 40° latitude
1-22-67 Echo I was going NE at 8:01 P.M. at 72° longitude 40° latitude
4-29-67 Pageos A was going SE at 7:32 P.M. at 73° longitude 40° latitude
6-21-67 Echo I was going NE at 10:54 P.M. at 70° longitude 40° latitude
6-29-67 Echo I was going NE at 9:41 P.M. at 90° longitude 40° latitude
7-5-67 Echo I was going SE at 10:02 P.M. at 66° longitude 40° latitude
7-5-67 Echo II was going SE at 10:52 P.M. at 56° longitude 40° latitude
7-13-67 Echo II was going SE at 10:56 P.M. at 81° longitude 40° latitude
7-13-67 Echo I was going SE at 9:26 P.M. at 91° longitude 40° latitude

3. The Echo satellites are 600 to 700 miles high and are quite bright. The Pageos A satellite is about 360 miles high and although it is not as bright as the Echo satellites, it is visible to the naked eye.

4. When photographing these satellites [redacted] is bound to get just a point source of light. However, if he wishes to improve the quality of his picture he should try a time exposure.

5. We are returning Mr. [redacted] photo to you. Because of the poor quality, we did not feel that it was necessary to have any photo analysis done.

1. We are in receipt of two UFO letters and photos that may be of
interest to you. Due to the dates of the observations and the areas
covered we feel it is too late for an interview with the individuals
concerned.

2. Mr[redacted] was personally interviewed by Major Ross, approximately
a year ago. Major Ross was then the Base Operations Officer. Mr.[redacted]
sent photos he had taken at that time but were of the same quality as the
photos enclosed so they were returned to him. There was no action taken
at that time.

3. If you feel additional information is needed I shall be only too
happy to help in any way possible.

Base Questions Office
McGuire AFB, N.J. ATT: UFO Investigations.

Dear Sir:

Where does the light go when it goes out? Where do flying saucers go when they stop flying?

About one year ago this month I reported a U.F.O. that was stationary & then began to move at the time I was looking right at it. Since then I believe I have seen a number of these same objects on various nights.

I was very near New York City - being near the Newark, Little City - New York air ports a moving object is not readily visible. I have a very open area here to observe & can see for many miles with no distraction.

First of all why do they appear at night most of the time & always the same size & brilliance? I believe they are flying high enough to appear star like as possible. Then I now believe these objects fly very high, roughly thirty thousand feet, with a fluid like motion, effortless, height reduces effect of speed, now done - moving in a definite direction.

From the middle of July thru August the (OVER)

weather here has been very overcast - at no time have I seen any of these objects in cloudy or rainy weather. I believe they fly above the clouds.

Out of the sighting area is accidental. I planned watching, as these most have been many more I didn't see. In the last week since the weather cleared I have been watching at different times during the evening but have not seen any more.

In the nite of July 8, a 13th I took a total of five pictures. When I had them developed they apparently thought the films were blank & did not mean them. I have attempted to do so on one & will inclose it with this letter. I have these same pictures on another roll not yet developed & will hold same until I hear from you. One side of the 3-D picture came out very good, the other did not come up as bright. I believe these are the matching pairs.

I will not attempt to describe the object I saw at the time, turn & direction.

#1 10:23:36 at 10:55 am I was returning to work on object about as large as a small orange brilliant, stationary low about 30° high. I watched it for about three minutes, while waiting for traffic to stop. I crossed

the street, the object was obscured by a building. I
went to the rear of the building expecting to see
the object but it was no longer visible.

Re 11:16 hrs take light 9 to 9:25 PM moving South-to-toward
3 11:20 hrs moving SE, 76/80, 82 deg to 79° PM moving South-East ward
4 1/21/67 moving SW, 62/80, 82 deg to 79° PM moving South-West
5 1/22/67 " " " " 82 deg To 8:25 PM " north-East ward

6 4/13/67 (approx) but my note on this the most important
observation to date - object apparent diameter of the
moon 5". Brilliant bright white object, approached
from my right as I was driving to work between
4:30 - 5 am. St then curved the street ahead of
me going in a northerly direction but to my
surprise I realized I was catching up to it.
It had not turned a mile I got to the
intersection about from which I
had first noticed object, it was overhead! I
got out of the car + looked up expecting it
to be still going northly but as I looked up
it then began to move west ward. still the
same size, could not see any fine large wings
or usual lights, except a near pulsating bright
large in comparison to size of object on the
near as it moved westward, now less. (OVER)

Continuing with my observations:

4/28/67 Elat I sing SE at 7:30 pm 790 to 7:55 PM moving eastward
6/21/67 Elat I sing SE at 8:54 pm 790 to 8:57 PM northeast
6/23/67 Elat I sing SE at 8:40 pm 790 to 10:00 PM northeast
7/5/67 Elat I sing SE at 10:50 pm 790 to 11:05 PM Southward (Task Picture)
7/5/67 Elat I sing SE at 10:57 pm 790 to 11:20 PM Eastward (Task Picture)
7/16/67 Elat I sing SE at 10:50 pm 790 to 11:05 PM Southward (Task Picture)
7/24/67 Elat I at 9° 790 to 9:40 PM Southward (Task Picture)
7/13/67 980 to 10:20 PM Southward (Task Picture)

Summarizing everything now. I believe these objects are extraterrestrial - not natural phenomena. It couldn't happen as often in one area in such a short time. They are not planets, satellites, or meteors.

I also believe the Air Force or the Government attaches importance to these observations. I only hope I am right in what I have seen.

I have watched all of these objects with mine power binoculars & they still do not seem to be much larger.

Awaiting your reply. I remain,

Lyndhurst, NJ
