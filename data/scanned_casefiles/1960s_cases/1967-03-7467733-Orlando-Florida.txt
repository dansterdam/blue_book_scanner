K. NCOIC, Ground Training Section, Operations and Training Division, 1360th Air Base Group, Orlando AFB, Florida. The investigator contacted the Central Florida Museum and Planetarium of Orlando. The observer at the planetarium did not actually observe the objects covered by this report, he felt certain the two objects reported were the planet Mars and Jupiter. I believe the objects sighted were the planets Mars and Jupiter.
