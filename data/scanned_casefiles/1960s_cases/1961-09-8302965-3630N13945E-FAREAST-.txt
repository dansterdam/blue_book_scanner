10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Viewed for 2-3 sec. Explosion. Bright light last 1/2 sec. last observed as ball of light w/extremely short tail. Looked like ball of fire.

11. COMMENTS
Pilots saw what appeared to be an extremely explosion which was viewed less than 1 sec. 1 pilot reported obj had a short tail. Both reported obj had very little, if any, movement. Elevation of obj was too high to have been an atomic explosion above arctic, plus, direction of observation tends to rule this out. Most logical explanation would be a large meteor exploding in earth's atmosphere. Therefore this report is categorized as probably bolide.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
■ Probably Astronomical
□ Possibly Astronomical
□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
