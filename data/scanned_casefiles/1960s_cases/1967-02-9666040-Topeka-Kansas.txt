11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer was driving in his car when he noticed an oval-shaped object on his 120 degree azimuth. The object was brilliant white in color and was rotating. He stopped his car to observe it further. The object was noted because the car windows were up. The object disappeared behind a hill.
G-2 reported Project TP, Kansas at 02362 17 Feb 67. The observer's report was compared to a Utility Flight Military flight that occurred in the area on the date of the incident. The profile of the object corresponds to a jet aircraft in a holding pattern at a distance of 15-20 miles. The attitude of the object indicated a heading of 330 degrees at an altitude of 28,000 feet. This corresponds to the witness statements.

LIGHTS OF DEPARTING C-133. ERUPTIONS DESCRIBED IN ALPHA (6) WERE
PROBABLY REFLECTIONS OFF OF LIGHT FALLING SNOW IN AREA. IN MY
OPINION MANY UFO OBSERVERS HAVE THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT BECAUSE
AN OBJECT APPEARS TO BE STATIONARY IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE AN AIR-
CRAFT. THIS OBSERVER WAS IN A MOVING VEHICLE AND IT IS MY BELIEF
