11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer was driving in his car when he noticed an oval shaped object on an 330 degree azimuth. The object looked as if a flare at one time the sighting. No sound was noted because the car windows were up. The object just faded from view.

C-130 departed Forbes AFB, Kansas at 04362 17 Feb 67. The aircraft made a right turn to intercept an airway. The aircraft should have passed approximately two miles west of the sighting location at an altitude of 2000 on a heading of approximately 310 degrees. It appears that the witness viewed the lights of this departing aircraft.

HOME JUL JET: C-130 DEPARTED FORBES AFB AT 0+3Z, TURNED RIGHT
AFTER TAKE-OFF TO INTERCEPT AIRWAY BETWEEN TOPEKA AND SALINA
KANSAS. SHOULD HAVE PASSED APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES WEST OF SIGHTING
LOCATION AT AN ALTITUDE OF 2,830*AGL ON A HEADING OF APPROXIMATELY
310 DEG. KILO: BASE OPERATIONS OFFICER. BELIEVE SIGHTING TO BE
LIGHTS OF DEPARTING C-130. ERUPTIONS DESCRIBED IN ALPHA (66) WERE
PROBABLY REFLECTIONS OFF OF LIGHT FALLING SNOW IN AREA. IN MY
OPINION MANY UFO OBSERVERS HAVE THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT BECAUSE
AN OBJECT APPEARS TO BE STATIONARY IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE AN AIR-
CRAFT. THIS OBSERVER WAS IN A MOVING VEHICLE AND IT IS MY BELIEF
