Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes    No    Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound zig-zagging, varying in speed
b. Color Bright orange-reddish

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image does not contain any photographs, only diagrams and text. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and output the text found in the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Erratic zig-zag moton, appeared to be under control, made 45° turns to left and right, final disappearance to the north.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This sighted was as observed of the northeast horizon by me on July 6, 1957. I first noticed the object about 7:50 PM and observed it for approximately 15 minutes. It appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. The object was a bright white or silver color and gave off a light in all directions. It did not appear to be an aircraft or meteor as known to me. The object made no sound and left no trail as it moved through the sky. For this reason I feel it was not a conventional aircraft.
