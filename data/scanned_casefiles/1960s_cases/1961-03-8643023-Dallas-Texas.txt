2. LOCATION: Dallas, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0407 Local
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. SOURCE: Civilian
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-5 sec
7. PHOTOS: No
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: SW
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: A big, extremely fast obj streaking from ENE to SW across sky. "Greyhound bus about a mile away" going about 1700 mph, head lights out, but looks dusty glow behind. No sound or color. Disappeared - 230° fm N, 40° fm horizon.
11. COMMENTS: Obj apparently moving to SW, which is counter to any artificial satellites. Description of obj is characteristic of an obj entering earth's atmosphere. Direction of movement rules out satellites, therefore, obj was probably a meteor.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
- Was Balloon
- Probably Astronomical/meteor
- Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation

March 16th, 1961

Hon. Bruce Alger
WASHINGTON, D. C.

Dear Sir:

At exactly 4:07 AM CST early Thursday morning, March 9th, I was out in my back yard, doing a bit of meteor watching, when I saw the polls-dot 12 footer, and

I saw A 310, extremely fast, unidentified object streaking from about NE to SW across the sky. It was fast. I have no form on it, but I do remember quite a bit of impression it left with me.

This object, seemingly, moved so fast that I would never have given it much later thought, except that on 7:09 AM morning carried big story that the Russians had crashed a dog, etc. in a 5-ton rocket.

If however looks after things like that should happen to want my impressions of this thing I saw, I would be glad to tell them that I remember, I know this is rather silly later, but I want to tell someone, and, naturally, I AM curious as to whether the time coincided with what we might know of their rocket's course done.

Sincerely,
