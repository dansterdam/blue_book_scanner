11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer watched a star like object move. Grew then sky. The object moved in air-zig zag like with no pattern. When the object came close to the moon it disappeared. At the same time in another part of the sky two additional objects made slow progress across the sky, but they would separate more than across the moon. This initial about 15 minutes before disappearing completely.

The witness lives in a high density aircraft area. The description is consistent with that of an or possible several aircraft observation.
