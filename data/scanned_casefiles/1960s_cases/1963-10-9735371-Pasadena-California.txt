2. The following UFO sighting was reported at 1900, 5 October 1963,
   to the 35D Command Post, Inglewood, California:

   a. Description: A large silver object, described as having a
      slight blush fluorescence. Four lights appeared
      to be located in the "middle."

   b. Course: North, traveling at a high rate of speed at approximately
      5,000 feet.

   c. Manner of Observation: Visual.

   d. Time and Date: Dusk on 5 October 1963.

   e. Location of Observer: "Eagle Rock," near Pasadena, California.

   f. Observer: [redacted] age 12½. No address or phone number

   g. Weather Condition: Clear, 5 miles at dusk.

   h. Unusual Activities: None.

   i. Identification Actions: None.

   j. Air Traffic: Usual commercial and military traffic from
      several airports in the Los Angeles Complex.

   k. Preparing Officer's Position and Comments:
      (1) Emergency Plans Officer, 35D.

      (2) The sighting was reported as two glimpses as the view of
      the observer was obscured by both the haze and the setting
      sun. Inability to contact the observer precluded investigation for additional details. The location indicates
      that the object was an aircraft climbing on a northeast heading from a Los Angeles airport.
