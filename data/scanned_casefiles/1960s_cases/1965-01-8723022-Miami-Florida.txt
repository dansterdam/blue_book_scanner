11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Round metallic object reflecting sunlight. Yellowish red color. Sky clear. Observation at sunset. Observed while A/C were in area.

NOTES: See info, Case 13 March 1964, Same witness.

COMMENTS: ECHO I was over Miami area at 2306Z but heading NE. Daylight conditions are such that an object of the dimness of a satellite would not likely be observed. Witness is not regarded as reliable due to previous correspondence. If an object was observed it is likely that the witness misinterpreted some conventional object, such as an aircraft.
