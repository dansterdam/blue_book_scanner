UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

1. AT APPROXIMATELY 5:45 P.M. ON 8 APRIL 1964, PATROLMAN LONNIE ZAMORA, OF THE SOCORRO POLICE DEPARTMENT, WAS ON ROUTINE PATROL ON HIGHWAY 85 ABOUT 5 MILES SOUTH OF SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO.

2. PATROLMAN ZAMORA WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 85 WHEN HE HEARD A ROAR AND SAW A FLAME IN THE SKY TO THE SOUTHWEST. HE STOPPED HIS PATROL CAR AND SAW AN OBJECT DESCEND RAPIDLY TO THE GROUND BEHIND A SMALL HILL ABOUT 1/2 MILE SOUTH OF HIS POSITION.

3. ZAMORA PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY TO THE AREA WHERE HE THOUGHT THE OBJECT HAD LANDED. AS HE APPROACHED THE AREA, HE SAW A SHINY OBJECT ON THE GROUND. HE DROVE CLOSER AND SAW THAT IT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND ABOUT 15 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS FURTHER DESCRIBED AS AN EGG-SHAPED OBJECT WITHOUT FINS OR LEGS.

4. ZAMORA ALSO REPORTED OBSERVING TWO SMALL FIGURES, APPARENTLY CLAD IN WHITE COVERALLS, NEAR THE OBJECT. HE STOPPED HIS CAR AT ABOUT 150 YARDS FROM THE OBJECT AND GOT OUT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER, BUT AS HE APPROACHED, THE OBJECT ROSE STRAIGHT UP WITH A TREMENDOUS ROAR AND FLAME, FRIGHTENING HIM AND CAUSING HIM TO RUN BACK TO HIS CAR.

5. AFTER THE OBJECT TOOK OFF, ZAMORA NOTICED BURNING BUSH VEGETATION AND DEEP IMPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND WHERE THE OBJECT HAD BEEN.

6. ZAMORA REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT HAD RED LETTERING OR MARKINGS ON ITS SIDE WHICH HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE. HE COULD NOT READ THE LETTERING, AND IT WAS GONE BEFORE HE COULD GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE IT CLEARLY.

7. INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF THIS INCIDENT IS CONTINUING.

Socorro, New Mexico - April 24, 1964

At approximately 5:45 p.m. on April 24, 1964, a Sergeant of the New Mexico State Police, stationed at Socorro, New Mexico, reported seeing a strange-looking object land in the desert near Socorro and two humanlike figures emerge from it.

The Sergeant, who was a highly respected and experienced officer, stated that he was driving along the highway when he observed the object descend and land on the desert floor at a distance of about one mile. He said the object appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 feet in height, and had a dome-shaped top. 

As the object landed, the Sergeant said he saw two humanlike figures emerge from it. These figures, he stated, were about five feet tall, and were dressed in close-fitting black or dark-colored suits. He said they walked around the object for a few minutes, then re-entered it, and the object took off at a high rate of speed, ascending vertically.

The Sergeant stated that he stopped his vehicle, got out, and observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from sight. He said the object made no sound and left no markings on the desert floor. The Sergeant's report was confirmed by a number of other witnesses in the area at the time.

SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO, APRIL 24, 1964 

Officer Lonnie Zamora was patrolling a lonely stretch of Highway 85 south of Socorro, New Mexico, when he saw a shiny, egg-shaped object hovering in a gully about 50 yards off the highway. As he approached, a red flash appeared and a loud roar was heard. Zamora stopped his car and got out to investigate. 

He heard a thump and saw a flame briefly appear below the object, which was about 15 to 20 feet long. Two small figures seemed to be standing near it. Zamora moved closer, then retreated and called the state police for assistance. When other officers arrived, the object had disappeared, leaving behind scorched bushes and indentations in the soil where it had been. This sighting received nationwide publicity and was one of the most significant UFO incidents on record.

SIGHTING OF OBJECT
AND LANDING MARKS

On the evening of April 24, 1964, Police Officer Lonnie Zamora was patrolling south of Socorro, New Mexico, when he heard a roar and saw an object descend rapidly, apparently landing in a remote area about a mile and a half south of the city. Zamora investigated and found a small shiny object resting on the ground, approximately 15 feet long and about 7 feet wide, oval in shape. As he approached, two small figures, apparently clad in white coveralls, emerged from the object and quickly reentered it. Flames were then observed coming from the underside of the object, after which it took off rapidly and disappeared from sight. Zamora also noticed impressions in the soil where the object had been resting.
