None

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Mrs [redacted] reported that a neighbor, Mrs [redacted] had seen the same object in approximately the same location.
Although Mrs [redacted] was unsure of directions, she was able to tell the police of the sunset relative to her sighting it was determined that the object was in the northwest, approximately 20° elevation.
Due to the long time of observation and relatively slow movement it was further determined that the object was most probably a star.
After consulting with a senior navigator it appears that this star was Arcturus.
