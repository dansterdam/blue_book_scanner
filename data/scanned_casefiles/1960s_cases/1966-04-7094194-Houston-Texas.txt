UFO Reclassified As
Rice Freshman's IFO

Friday night's unidentified flying object over Southwest Houston was reclassified an IFO (identified flying object) Saturday.

It turned out to be a prank engineered by an enterprising Rice freshman, Bob Vanzant, a chemical engineering student.

Vanzant, the son of Dr and Mrs Thomas J. Vanzant of 3629 Inwood, masterminded the launching of two hydrogen-filled balloons carrying six railroad flares.

Vanzant was assisted in the hoax by David Bachman, Dickason; James DePitts, Alta Loma; Dewayne Huckaby, Calumet City, Ill.; Mike McFarland, West Palm Beach, Fla.; Beau Jon Sackett, Houston; Harold Magnus, Port Arthur; and John Thacher, Midland, Mich.

Vanzant said the "saucer" was actually two hydrogen-filled balloons carrying an 8-foot frame of wood and aluminum covered with aluminum foil. Railroad flares were attached to provide the cluster of red lights reported by viewers.

Newspaper, radio, television and police switchboards were swamped with calls shortly after 10 PM Friday from Southwest Houston residents who had spotted the red lights from the flares.

In its Saturday morning story, The Houston Post quoted one witness, a Rice engineering student, as saying he thought the object had been launched from a campus parking lot by some students.

Houston Post, 17 APR 66.

UFO 'Joke' Launched by Rice U. Students

The "unidentified flying object" that excited Southwest Houston area residents Friday night was two weather balloons rigged with railroad flares and an aluminum foil reflector.

The device was put together in the room of Robert Vanzant, 19, an engineering freshman at Rice University. Vanzant said he and five other students sent the "UFO" aloft as a joke.

"It was really a great feeling when it lifted off the ground. We think it came off as a pretty good joke," Vanzant said.

He said the device consisted of two balloons about 5¼ feet in diameter, carrying a wood and aluminum frame about 8 feet in diameter and covered with shiny aluminum foil.

He said the hydrogen-filled balloons should have climbed to a height of "several thousand feet" after the railroad flares burned out.

"It should have gone high enough that the balloons burst from inside pressure," he said.

Vanzant said he was assisted by freshman engineering students Mike McFarland, Beau Jon Sackett, David Beakman, James DePitis, Harold Magnus, Dewayne Rickabay and John Treichler.

Switchboards of police, newspapers, and radio and television stations were flooded with calls about a UFO sighted shortly after 10 p.m. Friday by residents and motorists near the Shepherd Drive-Southwest Freeway area.

U.S. Files to Draw GM Into Accident Suit
BY MORTON MINTZ
Washington Post News Service

Washington - The United States government is suing to bring to light details of the 1961 Tempest sedan in Bel-Air a long time before the Tempest's with a front-end mode of its Tempest's "dangerous" design.

NOTICE!
DUE TO THE FIRE AT OUR S. MAIN
LOCATION—THAT LOCATION WILL BE
CLOSED FOR THE TIME BEING

HOPE YOU WILL VISIT US AT EITHER
5911 BELLAIRE MO 6-2571
OR

YOURSELF—IF YOU CAN SERVE THE SAME FOOD
YOU RECEIVED ON S. MAIN FOR OVER 30
YEARS, WE WILL APPRECIATE IT.

[CALL SU 1-1555]

Pontiac Tempest into the matter of a "hazardous design."

The case is believed to be the first in which the government has attempted to lay responsibility for an accident solely on a vehicle's design.

The government is being sued by a woman who was seriously injured while undergoing surgery.

Schlesinger said in his petition that GM should be required to indemnify the government for the cost of defending the suit and for any judgment that might be rendered against the government.

Only Tempest
But the government says only Tempest was involved in the accident, which occurred on the United States Forest Service road. The sudden stop caused numerous accidents and injuries.

No Riding Yet
The court has not yet ruled whether to make GM a third-party defendant, but is expected to do so with the petition filed by Schlesinger.

Consequently, no papers have been served at this time on General Motors, which is made a third-party defendant.

The accident occurred on United States Forest Service road near Lake Montezuma, Ariz., with Clifford Schlesinger, who was injured, was beside him at the time.

The government's "affirmative" GM "acts and omissions" including the following:

Changes
This design, the government says, "was defective, hazardous and dangerous in its nature" from the front end ... would tip down five inches for any cause whatever.

The government got the blame for the "affirmative" acts in the case.

The case is believed to be the first in which the government has attempted to lay responsibility for an accident at the door of a manufacturer.

The government is being sued by a woman who was seriously injured when the undercarriage of her car collapsed.

(Remaining text continues but some portions are difficult to fully read due to image quality)

The headline reads: "U.S. Files to Draw GM Into Accident Suit"
