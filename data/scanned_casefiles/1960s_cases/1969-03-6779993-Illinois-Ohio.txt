OBJECT WAS QUITE BRIGHT, APPEARING WHITE. HOWEVER, I HAVE SOME COLOR DEFICIENCY IN MY SIGHT. IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT BRIGHTLY COLORED. IT APPEARED, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, TO FALL VERTICALLY. THE EDGES OF THE STREAK APPEARED FUZZY, AND IT COULD BE IMAGINED THAT SOME MATERIAL COULD BE SEEN BOILING OFF. THE SHAPE WAS A BRIGHT FIREBALL TAILED BY A BRIGHT STREAK EXTENDING SUBTENDING PERHAPS 5 DEGREES OF ARC. OBJECT DID NOT DISAPPEAR BEHIND SURFACE OBSTRUCTIONS, BUT APPARENTLY BURNED OUT.
