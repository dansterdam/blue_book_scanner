The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a typed document describing a UFO sighting.

TEXT OUTPUT:

OBJECT WAS QUITE BRIGHT, APPEARING WHITE. HOWEVER, I HAVE LOOKED CLOSELY AND IT SEEMED QUITE DISTINCTLY A DLT BRIGHT. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT BRIGHTLY COLORED. IT APPEARED, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, TO FALL VERTICALLY. THE EDGES OF THE STREAK APPEARED FUZZY, AND IT COULD BE IMAGINED THAT SOME SUBSTANCE COULD BE SEEN BOILING OFF. THE SHAPE WAS A BRIGHT FIEBALL TAILED BY A BRIGHT STREAK APPROXIMATELY EXTENDING PERHAPS 2 LENGTHS OF ARC. OBJECT DID NOT DISAPPEAR BEHIND SURFACE OBSTRUCTIONS, BUT APPARENTLY BURNED OUT.
