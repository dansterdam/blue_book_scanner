10. CONCLUSION
Satellite(Echo I)
Echo I was north of the observation point and traveling on a NE heading at 0427.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a star like object in the northwest sky traveling toward the NE. The white solid object was compared to that of a light reflection from a mirror. The object appeared to be burning, glowingly white. As it was moving across the sky, as can be seen, the object faded from view but came back on before it disappeared.

The description is consistent with that of a satellite observation. Echo I was over 103 deg N and 45 deg W at approximately 0427, on a heading toward the NE.

The first few lines appear to be handwritten but are largely unreadable due to the redactions.

At the bottom of the page, there are three hole punches on the left side, indicating this is likely a document from a file or binder.

The text on this page is partially illegible due to handwritten script and image quality. I can make out some words and partial sentences, but cannot confidently transcribe the entire document. The visible text appears to be a handwritten report or statement. There is a black redacted section at the bottom of the page. The document has hole punches on the left and right sides, suggesting it is from a file or binder. The text seems to be written in cursive/script style, making full OCR challenging.

IDEN/UFO
UFO Observations

9 January 1967

Indianapolis, Indiana 46224

1. Reference your letter of December 29, 1966 regarding unidentified flying objects over the Indianapolis, Indiana area.

2. In regards to your August 1965 observation, the late date in reporting this observation prevents comprehensive investigation. It would be extremely difficult to obtain records of any activity that far in the past. Normally such records are kept for several months and then disposed of, since they are no longer current.

3. Please complete the attached FTD Form 164 on your 12 November 1966 observation and we will try to make a comprehensive analysis. Attempts will be made to try to identify the stimulus which caused your sighting.

4. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
