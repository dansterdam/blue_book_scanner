Dear Mr.

JUL 12 1967

This replies to your recent correspondence on your unidentified observation of June 4, 1967.

Investigation revealed that you probably observed the passing of ECHO II. This particular satellite, with an estimated stellar magnitude of -1.0, would have been visible from your area. At approximately 0345, EST, June 4, 1967, ECHO II would have been traveling over central Iowa on a southerly heading. The satellite would have entered the earth's shadow at approximately 35.6 latitude, which would have accounted for its disappearance in the MSW.

Sincerely,

7 June 1967

Gentlemen:

I wish to report my seeing an unusual object in the sky:

On the morning of June 4, 1967 I sighted this light in the at about 3:30 A.M. It was a brilliant object about three times or more the brilliance of the brightest star in the sky. From my location ( north central Penna.) it appeared in the sky at about NNW and in a couple minutes had moved to about WSW where it quickly faded completely from view. It was at an elevation of about 45 degrees above the horizon.

It is possible that this was an American or Russian satellite. If you wish additional information, or would care to hazard a guess as to the nature of this flying object I would be curious to know your opinion.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Raymond Nelson
Major, AF Res.
