The image does not contain any photographs. The image contains an illustration with a sketch showing an angular perspective of an object in the sky, and a compass rose diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I have had several experiences like this and would like to look at them further. Stars on a clear night, like might in a cup saucer. And long sky this, any motion. I have sighted many satellites and echo was like an old moon glowing. Do not seem like any regular action on another satellite or bird but at night came he or like, I have seen nothing like this before. That is why I reported my sighting.
33. When and in what position were you when you first observed this object? 8:25 PM

Transcription of the text:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 31 8 67

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was observing the stars in the night sky at about 10:30 p.m. when I noticed an unusual object in the sky. It was about 50 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and had flashing lights around the perimeter. It was moving in a zig-zag motion and was completely silent. At times it appeared to hover, and at other times it would suddenly dart off at a high rate of speed. This went on for about 10-15 minutes. 

I do not want to be identified. I am a businessman and I am concerned that if this were made public, it could have a negative impact on my business. Please treat this information in a confidential manner. I would be willing to provide more details to an officer at a later time, but I do not wish for my name to be associated with this report.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
