35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

[Handwritten text begins]
After one question #52. The object was in sight a long time before, you were a half minute, and was that time it was a continuous sighting in view all the time, no change in its night or whatever.

I spent outside to find the birds had a kind of point of view. Then in my hand. It was only when the trees looked like someone should look me. I immediately caught sight of this object and quite the same down in my driveway after watching for a minute a half, was back into the house on the double, was outside. But it was no longer in sight. That is all the information I can give you on this object.

I told the Officer also that I feel another sighting of an object that was very unusual. Not getting two forms, I can't report the second one. If you send me another form I will be only too happy to report on my second sighting at about eleven minutes after the first one.

In closing I must say you people are on your toes. It's nice to know we have people who give so much to our Country. We have a son in Vietnam. The Air Force, including Bombers 306 was all there children. God be with all of you.

Sincerely,
