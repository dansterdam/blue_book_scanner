INVESTIGATION OF MARCH 10-11: GALESBURG AND MOLINE, ILL.

Four witnesses or sets of witnesses were contacted and interviewed during this 1-1/2 day trip(since officers from Chanute Field were in the area also,)only the cases that sounded as if there might be something substantial to the story were investigated. In the course of the investigation, four or five incidental sightings dealt with by telephone. All were of the light-in-the-sky type, and could reasonably be attributed to Venus and Jupiter, or airplane landing lights. There were several brief interviews with newspapers and radio stations, in which the investigator gave a review of the bright objects which were in the sky and could be mistaken for something usual. The investigations with the principal witnesses are reported below.

Galesburg, Illinois. About 40 years old, and married; he has been a Deputy for at least 15 years. At present he conducts a night patrol alone throughout the outlying areas of the Sheriff's Department in downtown.

On the morning of March 6, at 0A25 (by watch), he was parked stop an overpass one mile east of Henderson, which is east several miles. He often stops here, because there is a good view of surrounding roads. At 0A25, he thought he saw a meteor or a fireball southeast of him, at least 15 miles away. This object was red in color, and may have been traveling apparently toward him; he saw shortly that it was nothing with which he was familiar, and (still in the patrol car) reached into the rear of the car.

to get his binoculars out. While he was finding them and getting them out, he kept watching out the side rear window, (car facing west). At this point he almost decided to "get out of there", but remained. He got out of the car, and looked at the approaching object through binoculars, at which time he saw the shape shown in the accompanying drawing (made by the observe except for labellings). He said that if one imagined the bottom part to be like one of the rubber cups placed under furniture legs, and a dome set down into the cup, the appearance would be exactly the same. The whole bottom part seemed to be spinning rapidly, at " to 5000 RPM (or possibly "4,500 RPM" - the tape isn't clear). The rim section pulsated red all over at irregular intervals, averaging a second or more between pulsations; the pulsations were definitely not regular, nor did they display any other pattern that he would notice.
The object approached straight toward the observer and passed directly overhead at low altitude. At the overhead point, he indicated that it would have subtended about 14 inches at arm's length, or roughly 30 degrees. He could see the circular plan view of the bottom, which was also rotating, and appeared to have closely-spaced strips across it, which rotated with the rest of the bottom section. A hissing sound was heard while the object was near, like air under high pressure escaping. There was no tone to the sound, just a hissing, said there was no resemblance to the sound of any kind of engine, jet or piston, that he knows. He is a private pilot. The hiss was continuous, growing in intensity as the object approached and fading as it left.
When the object had passed over and had travelled on its straight course toward the northwest for perhaps one minute, a brilliant column appeared.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that describes the sighting of a UFO in Tawas, Michigan in 1967.

Here is the text output from the document:

of light shone straight down from the bottom of the object, for two or three seconds, and then shut off again. This column of light was about 3/4 the diameter of the object, and its sides were parallel and normal to the ground and the level bottom of the object. The bottom of the beam was cut off by trees. The light was white, and I likened it to a ray of sunlight shining from between clouds. After the light shut off, the object continued to the horizon. It disappeared at 0436, having taken 10 minutes between the overhead position and disappearance.

The top of the object appeared to be white, and sparkled like salt crystals on a road when headlights shine on them, although the headlights (which were on) were not aimed toward the object. At the top was a circular (apparently) area which seemed to have a dome of transparent material set into it, but inverted - going inward rather than outward. Surrounding the whole object at all times was a bluish-white haze, like a halo around the moon, or like the scattered light around a spotlight beam.

Height above the ground was such that his horizon would be about 7 miles away; if the object were 200 feet in the air, another 14 miles would be added, making 21 miles from overhead to the northwest horizon. The object travelled this distance in 10 minutes, and seemed to speed up during the last minutes. Assuming a constant speed, we can calculate the airspeed as about two miles per minute, or 120 statute miles per hour. The speed would be proportional to the square root of the height above the ground, so that at a 100 foot altitude, the speed would be 85 mph, and at 1000 feet it would be 265 mph. I estimated the speed at 300 mph, and was not able to estimate altitude.

The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing only text.

Transcribed text:

However from his size estimate (30 feet) and the angular diameter when closest, the object would have had an altitude of only 50 feet. Angular estimates are well-known, however, for being grossly exaggerated by almost all witnesses, trained or not, so the actual height consistent with a 30-foot diameter could be anything up to 500 feet.

Once saw a similar object, without the bright white light, about 12 to 15 years previously when he was a Deputy in Humboldt, Iowa. He watched it dart back and forth, starting and stopping abruptly, for about an hour, and then called a sherriff's officer to come and join him; the officer was impressed. However, many witnesses will say an object was "similar" when the points of similarity are very few; there was no way to get enough detail on this previous sighting to enable an evaluation to be made.

He mentioned that on two additional occasions over this time-span he has seen objects that did not seem ordinary, but that the present one was by far the most impressive. He is positive that what he saw was not an airplane or helicopter, or "one of them little plastic balloons" (there had been a hoax in the area involving a balloon and a flare). He says he saw what he saw; he is certain it is some kind of piloted craft, that it is nothing conventional, and that he could not have mistaken anything else for such an object. He says his eyesight is perfect and that he is not given to hallucinations or to telling lies.

He has been ribbed a good deal by his fellow-officers and even by his wife, but he says he doesn't care; they don't know what they're talking about, because they didn't see what he saw. He is willing to accept the idea that the earth is being visited from other civilizations in space, saying that he doesn't find this idea fantastic at all; in a thousand cases, he would be right.

This witness' story is unshinkable; he appears to be entirely in his right mind, and his description is clear.
I must classify this report as dealing with an unconventional object.
This is the only conclusion possible on the basis of the presented
information and the apparent character of the witness.

Present, because "talking about it upsets them too much."
The two ladies are next-door neighbors, living on farms about 
7.5 miles east of *****. Both have been watching UFO's frequently
since last August; however their interest arose from a sighting in August 
of 1966 which caused reasonable interesting, and so their subsequent
observations are at least motivated. Many of their observations have to 
do with lights in the sky, and they readily admitted that most of what
they have seen might had been conventional objects such as stars, planets
or aircraft. However on at least three occasions objects were seen which
they would not escape as conventional.
The August sighting involved a large oval red object that flew
through the air emitting a high-pitched whine on a single pass time
(very much like sightings in Laning Michigan and surroundings, 21-25
May, 1964, in USAF files). The next was on the Friday night following

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing a sighting that took place on March 9, 1967 in Tawas, Michigan.

The text in the document states:

her son, and two daughters saw the object through a window. It was very large, oval, and carried red, green, and yellow lights; it flew low over the house, and then seemed to drop suddenly behind the trees in a field north of the house. They have not been out to that field to investigate and do not intend to go.

The sighting which stimulated the investigation took place at 7:10 p.m. on March 9, 1967. The ladies were outside looking for UFOs as they do quite often, when they dropped her eyes toward the horizon a little south or west, and saw a bright pulsating red object hanging in the air, just above treetop level. It was apparently closer than it seemed, and soon they looked too. The object was shaped like a pancake, with a rim made of red lights which seemed to pulsate irregularly. The top was rounded, but there was no high dome on it. The object approached closer, and suddenly it seemed to explode. A brilliant white core of light fanned out from the object toward the witnesses, so bright that all who were watching (two adults, two teenagers, and four smaller children) had to cover their eyes: "That white light - I don't know what it was, I've never seen anything like it." The ladies were visibly upset during this initial recounting of the incident; one had tears in her eyes.

The white light lasted 10 seconds (by re-enactment), and then turned suddenly off. The red pulsating lights were again visible for a few seconds, and then the object accelerated very rapidly off to the north, disappearing behind trees in the northwest, or about 50 to 60 degrees from where it was first seen. Angular diameter was impossible to obtain, although the witnesses said that the "nowastorm" object had been much closer and clearer.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA
REPORT

Case Number: 1967-03-9735086
Location: Tawas, Michigan
Date: 9 March 1967

Description of Incident:
On the evening of 9 March 1967, several witnesses reported observing an unidentified aerial object near Tawas, Michigan. The object was described as a dark, elongated shape moving rapidly through the sky. Attempts were made to photograph the object, but the resulting image is unclear and indistinct.

Conclusion:
While the reported sighting is of interest, the lack of clear photographic evidence makes it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the nature of the observed object. The case remains classified as unidentified.

- page 12 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report regarding Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The fact that the witnesses have been looking for UFOs more or less as a hobby, and that they take them rather seriously and speculate about what they have here and where they are from, may seem to detract from their qualifications as witnesses. However, they gave the impression of being quite ordinary witnesses; their many sightings are typical of other sightings of planets and stars by people who are ignorant of astronomical objects or technology in general; their interest seemed quite adequately explained by their initial experience last August, and carried no overtones of mysticism. Indeed they had never paid attention to objects in the sky before the August sighting.

One would expect that witnesses like these would see many things which they could not explain if they observed the sky regularly; there is no reason to think that they are lying about having seen something, or that they are hallucinating. It was evident from their talk that while they suspected many objects of being UFOs, the sight of the object on the 9th of March was a real shock; they recognized immediately that they were dealing with something quite different from the "UFOs" they had been seeing previously. It should also be noted that while the ladies had observed many objects together during the past months, this was the first time they had ever reported anything. Even then they reported it only because they heard that other people were making reports, and in their publicity-known reports they mentioned only a sighting from several nights previously, an object which they readily agreed could have been Venus, when the investigator explained the appearance of Venus and where and when it could be seen. They reported the object of March 9 only after being convinced that they would receive no publicity and would not be ridiculed.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

5 minutes; later that night there were many radio reports from further south concerning bright objects "hanging in the sky". (These all sounded like Venus or Jupiter).

Sighting was not at close range and involved no effect, no conclusion about the actual cause of the lights can be reached. The case should be classified "unknown"; too little information for conclusion." This would correspond to the present class, "Insufficient information", except that by nature, no matter how well-observed by the witness the lights were, no decision could be reached. The object itself is nearly devoid of information.

Petresman, Keline Police Department, Keline, Illinois. sighting occurred on the afternoon of March 9, 1967. His eldest son was with him at the time. This case has been thoroughly investigated by officers from Chanute Field, so only general observations will be made concerning the motion picture film taken by ___________________

___________________was located on 14th Street and 16th Avenue, looking north. The object was seen visually at about a 45-degree elevation (modified by M___________ from the 30-degree angle given initially). The location is in the northwest portion of Keline.

The object went north; the witness felt that he could almost see what it was, but it became smaller. The film does not cover the closest approach of the object, something having gone wrong and the film not having been exposed for the first five feet of film. Finally the object drifted away to the northwest. A second object was then seen to follow the same path, giving exactly the same appearance and appearing to hover in the same places. M_______________ tried to photograph the second object, but found out that his camera had not been re-cocked properly.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an incident where a witness observed a "flying boxcar" air cargo plane that had just taken off from a nearby airport and was photographed for comparison. The report provides details about the sighting, including the time, location, and duration of the helicopter flight that was observed in the area. The report also describes the investigator's analysis of the films viewed, including observations about the appearance and movement of the object depicted, as well as the techniques that may have been used to enhance the image.

The text is as follows:

later that he had been out of film.

After the sighting, Fisher saw a "flying boxcar" air cargo plane which had just taken off from a nearby airport, and photographed it, too (he thought) for comparison. This was reported in newspapers as having sighted a UFO (the size of a "boxcar").

The sighting was from 1:31 to 1:43 p.m.; a helicopter flight was known to be in the area of the sighting, but it departed at 1100 and returned at 1250, thus being out of the area 40 minutes before the sighting.

The investigator viewed the films both at normal rate and at five frames per second a number of times. The sequence was in three parts, separated by windings of the camera, so that the appearance of the object changes abruptly twice, once with a pronounced streak. As the film progresses the object becomes smaller and fainter, showing less contrast with the background. In the first segment the object is large enough on the projection screen to show some detail.

The basic form is a horizontally elongated oval area of white against the blue of the sky. The image shows pronounced image breakup of the type often seen in astronomical images; the shape changes erratically as if being seen through a layer of water with random ripples coming by. There are two highlights, side by side, visible in many of the initial frames, with a surrounding and joining area of light color.

There are many frames in the initial section in which the object is in the same orientation and has the same size; therefore it seems possible to employ a multiple overprinting technique often used in astronomical planetary photography to improve the image. By carefully...

- page 15 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The text appears to be a typed document discussing the quality and details of a "movie film" that was recorded of an unidentified flying object. The document discusses the limitations of the film footage in capturing the true shape and details of the observed object, as well as potential ways to enhance the footage through techniques like composite printing and computer processing. The document also mentions the investigator's request to turn the film over to the Air Force for further analysis.

Printing one frame on top of another, a composite image may gradually be built up in which random variations due to atmospheric effects and grain can be averaged out, and a better idea obtained as to the true shape of the object.

Patrolman Fisher says that he saw the object visually when it was closer than in the pictures, and that both then and later it was far clearer visually than in the final movie: he was considerably disappointed in the quality of the film results. The first object appeared oval, with a dark underside and highlights on a metallic-looking body. The second object was similar but showed no dark underside. Judging from the atmospheric effects in the movie film, it is difficult to see how a visual observation could have shown any more detail, at least during the time the movie was made, because the image quite plainly is being strongly affected, and this could not be improved by visual observation. Of course the eye can perform averaging processes which film cannot, but by the same token the eye can inject information into an incomplete picture which is not really there.

It is highly advisable to attempt to bring out more detail from the films, by making composite prints and even by converting the pictures into density readings and processing the information by computer. The investigator had offers for the film from television networks and by magazines; he is still undecided as to what to do. Understandably he would like to take advantage of any such offers - as a patrolman, his salary is not stupendous - and in addition he feels that he has a duty to let the public know what he saw. The investigator requested that after he finished these arrangements, the film be turned over to the Air Force, to Northwestern.

University, or to the Condon committee for careful examination. He said
he would write when he knew what he was going to do with the film.

The investigator advised him that he would suggest to him that he would suggest to blue
Book that copies of the film be made by the Air Force, one negative
being given to Mr.  in return for temporary use of the original
film for evaluation. indicated that he would be happy to comply
with such a request; he cannot afford the cost of prints himself, and
would like to have a negative for lending to those who would like to
make their own copies, rather than risking the original. This of course,
is in the interests of those who want to examine an undamaged original.
Also,  pictures as they stand do not show whether the object
seen was conventional or not. An aircraft, particularly a jet, departing
along a climbing path straight away from the viewer could give the appear-
ance of an oval object, and motion appear to still or move only slightly
for several minutes. The fact that two objects in succession were seen
following similar flight paths suggests military aircraft departing for
patrol, or commercial flights departing one after another from the same
runway under tower control. The only way that these possibilities can
be checked out, other than finding the flights which were at the right
place and at the right time, would be to obtain more detail from the film,
or to perform an experiment in an attempt to reproduce the films with the
same camera, at the same time of day.

Because of the possibility of aircraft as an explanation, the
investigator would place this sighting in the category: 'unknown; possibly
conventional'.

Addendum: The classification being suggested might be outlined as follows:

Class 5: Object seen in sufficient detail to rule out conventional causes if the description is taken as accurate.
Class 4: Details observed which contradict conventional causes or unidentified in report or observation which could not have conventional explanation.
Class 3: Not enough detail observed to suggest either conventional or unconventional cause; either conventional or unconventional explanation equally applicable.
Class 2: Some unusual aspects to observation, but could be explained by prosaic scene conventional objects present (not, however, in contradiction to witness' statements).
Class 1: Object positively identified as conventional.

Dear Sirs,
On Monday, March 6 about 8:30 till 8:45 we sighted a UFO over our house. It was dark in color and moved over the address of 1905 South U.S. 23, Tawas City, Mich. It did not give any sound. When it moved on, it had a reddish light that went on and off. It was round in shape and as it was moved quite fast, and was up about 100 feet. It landed in some woods by our house. No one in our neighborhood seen it but my father and I. If it made a noise, we did not get a picture of it.
Yours truly,
