EVALUATION REPORT

Examination and Analysis of Suspected Rock Sample

REPORT NO: MAY 64-14                           DATE: 30 July 1964
PROJECT NO: 66102                               TYPE EVALUATION: SPEC NR

I.   PURPOSE:
     To conduct analysis of rock-like sample to determine its characteristics.

II.  FACTUAL DATA:
     1. The sample was submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch No.
        1-1241.

     2. The results are as follows:
        a. Emission Spectroscopy:
           Element     Estimated %     Element     Estimated %
           Si          20.              Na          .5
           Mg          .7               Zn          .1
           Mn          .01              Ni          .2
           B           .01              K           .2
           Al          .7               Ca          .1
           Fe          1.

        b. X-Ray Diffraction Patterns:
           X-ray results show presence of SiO2; sample is mostly amorphous and
           resembles pumice.

        c. Infrared Spectroscopy:
           Infrared spectrum shows lack of any organic material. From bands
           observed the sample appears to be a form of inorganic silicate.

The objects submitted to FTD for analysis has been determined to be a
Chinese rock common to the Southwest United States. It is suggested
that AFCRL be informed of our findings. A copy of the lab report is
attached.
