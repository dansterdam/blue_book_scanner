White Obj as a streak of Light, traveling due N in horizontal path situated at about 30° elevation. Traveled distance represented by an estimated 20° angle. No sound heard. Light resembled rocket blast in shape. Impression of relatively great length. Just seemed to fade out. Another witness situated obj as directly overhead.
Approx 20 mi E of first witness position.

11. COMMENTS
Obj of this sighting has all the characteristics of a very bright meteor. It is not unusual for a person's individual experience with outstanding meteors to result in misidentification. There is no evidence in this case to indicate that obj was anything other than a very bright meteor.

To: Major H. R. O'Brien

Evandale, Ohio

On the evening of Thursday, 2 March, 1961, at about 7:30 to 7:45 PM I observed a streak of light in the eastern sky. My location was my back yard at [redacted] Avenue, North College Hill (Cincinnah 31), Ohio. I noticed it by chance and was not sky watching. I was looking directly east at the object which appeared to be travelling due north in a horizontal path and was situated at about a 30° above the elevation.

I had the impression of viewing it full breadth-side. It was visible to me for about 5 seconds in which time it traversed an distance represented by an estimated 20° angle. There

Here is the OCR text from the document:

after burner roar or rocket roar. The light, however, did resemble a rocket blast in shape. The color to me was white. At the landing end I saw no bright spot or any different appearing spot. The trailing end was better yet nebulous. At this time it is difficult to describe its length, having had just a few seconds to make my observations. However, I have the impression of relative great length. Its general appearance to me was that it was not a meteor, but was suggestive of lightning, except for its finite convergent length and luminosity.

Thickness. At the terminus at the sighting, the object just appeared to fade out.

This morning, Cincinnati Enquirer on page 30 carried additional description by other observers. One sighting placed the object briefly, one head at a position somewhere between New Rich mound and Mt. Pleasant on U.S. 52. This is about 20 miles east of my sighting.

SUBJECT: Request for Information

10 AUG 1961

TO: SAFOI-3C (Major Coleman)

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. [redacted] reporting the sighting of a UFO, and requesting information same.

2. FTD files indicate that the same object observed by Mr. [redacted] was also observed at Springfield, Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio. The times, descriptions and flight paths in all cases were the same, bearing out this conclusion. The fact that the object was observed from four widely separated areas indicates that the object was at a very high altitude. The FTD conclusion is that the object was a fireball, one of three types of meteors.

slow the fading

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
just more round
and trailing smoke

Analysis and Conclusions: The description of the object is similar to that of a meteor, however, the duration is excessive. It is possible that the object was an aircraft which was released around lights. However, the information reported is not sufficient for the formation of a valid conclusion.

Time probably includes artglow of burst. Multiple report of old ida in area. All reports are about the same time and object moving in a Northerly direction. So, this report added to the other reports of this particular Meteor.

Richmond, Indiana
July 31, 1961

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dept. of Unidentified Flying Objects
Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

Information:  Unidentified flying object

Since I understand that you are interested in all reports of unidentified flying objects, I wish to inquire if you have a record of any seen about 7:30 P.M. E. S. T. on March 8, 1961, visible from Richmond, Indiana.

I first noticed this green-white light heading north, but quite low at perhaps 200 above the horizon in a direction about South 20° East from my residence, approximately 3 miles east of center of Richmond, Indiana.

It had a long luminous trail behind it but was not "sparkling off" like "shooting stars" or meteorites as I could tell. Also, it did not appear to have as much speed. I called the other members of my family to look out my east bedroom window where they easily picked it up and watched it disappear at perhaps 300 above our horizon. Still pursuing what I would call a very much northerly path. In all, I would judge that I was able to watch it for a total time of perhaps 20 seconds.

My thought at the moment was, "That must be the vehicle of Russia's latest sputnik" which was reported due to burn about that time.

If you have any information on this incident, I'd very much like to compare notes with you.

All "statistics" are from recollection and not actually measured.

Sincerely,

[Signature and additional details are redacted]

APR 25 1961

Dear [redacted]:

The report of your sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, on 2 March 1961 has been analyzed as due to the midwestern type meteor. This was not an ordinary meteor, but one of the exceptionally bright class known as "fireballs". Meteors of this type are generally in bright class and various colors. These meteors are usually long duration, and may display various colors. These meteors are relatively rare and most people have seen one. In their lifetime. Due to lack of experience with meteors of this type, and their startling appearance, it is not unusual for them to be misidentified.

Your report of the sighting was not unique in that it contained sufficient information as explained in a manner which contributed immaturely to the successful analysis.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

PHILIP G. EVANS
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science and Components
