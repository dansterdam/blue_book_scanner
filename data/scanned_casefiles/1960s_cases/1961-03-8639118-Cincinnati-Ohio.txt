USAF, 80th
Security Police

On the evening of Thursday, 2 March, 1961, at about 7:30 to 7:45 PM, I observed a streak of light in the eastern sky. My location was my back yard at North College Hill, Cincinnati, Ohio. Startled by chance and was not sky watching. I was looking directly east at the object which appeared to be traveling due north in a horizontal path and was situated at about a 30 degree elevation.

It had the impression of viewing it head-on at it was visible to me for about 5 seconds. It was visible to me for about 5 seconds and disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. Appeared as a distinct outline somewhat elliptical in shape and smaller than an average star, estimated size 20 angular minutes more or less.

There is no photograph present in the provided image. This appears to be a page from a handwritten document or report.

after the human say at a distance, the light vanished, she was almost a minute. the object, this evening by two of us, was brightly lighted. we could clearly see the shape. at the top it was pointed. it was glowing brightly. i saw no bright spot or any distinct appearing parts. the trailing end was nothing more. at this time of 6:30 it started to descend. having had just a few seconds to make my obdervations, however, i have the impression of relative great length. this general appearance to me was that it was not a meteor, but soon was engulfed in lightning, except at moments contrasted length and trembling. the beginning of the sighting the object just seemed to emit an intermittent illumination or glow just this morning. cincinnati, ohio, february 25, 1961. carried additional information by other observers. the sighting phoned the o.f. intelligence officer at a geiger somewhere between new galm and h. pleasant on u.s. 52. this is about 25 miles east of my sighting.

Evaluation of Source Reliability: The sighting appears to be a misidentification of streetlights and/or motion. The source is considered reliable but the sighting is likely explainable as a natural phenomenon.
Analysis and Conclusions: The sighting is considered a misidentification of streetlights and/or motion. There is no evidence to suggest the presence of any extraterrestrial or unidentified aerial phenomena.

REPLY TO OD-S
SUBJECT: Request for Information

TO: SAFOI-30 (Major Coleman)

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. reporting the sightings of a UFO, and requesting information on same.

2. PTD files indicate that the same object observed by Mr. was also observed at Breckinridge, Ohio. The time, descriptions and flight paths in all cases were the same, bearing out this continuation. The fact that the same object observed over a wide area over several hours indicates the very unusual nature of the PTD conclusion is that the object was a fireball, one of three types.

The image contains hand-drawn sketches illustrating how a UFO sighting may have appeared to an observer. The first sketch shows a curved line along the horizon, with an object above the horizon at different heights. The second sketch shows a larger view, with a person standing on a road and two smaller views of the sky above, indicating how the object may have appeared from different vantage points.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where the object was when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

July 21, 1961

Dept. of Installations
Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

Information: Unidentified flying object

Since I understand that you are interested in all reports of unidentified objects in the sky, I am reporting an incident which occurred on March 2, 1961, visible from Richmond, Indiana.

The object was traveling in a southerly direction, slightly north, but quite low at perhaps 2000 feet above the horizon in a direction somewhat over 20 miles east of north. 

It had a long luminous trail behind it but was not "sparkling off" like a meteor. Also, it did not appear to have a "much greater speed" as called the other meteor-like objects we had been observing in that area where 300° above our horizon still pursuing what would call "evasive action" which did not appear to be maneuver characteristic of a meteor.

By thought at the moment "that must be the vehicle of which was reported due to burn about that time."

If you have any information on this incident, I'd very much if be complete notes with you.

All "statistics" are from recollection and not actually measured.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VERY BRIGHT VERY FAST MOVING OBJECT. IT WAS SEEN FROM A POINT TO A POINT BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THE OBJECT. THE FACT THAT A GEIGER COUNTER WAS AFFECTED GIVES SOME SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN OF RADIOACTIVE NATURE. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BRIGHTER THAN THE BRIGHTEST STAR AND STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY WITH AMAZING SPEED. IT FAILED TO CONFORM TO ANY OF THE USUAL PHENOMENA.

APGIR-52
UFO Sighting, 2 May 61, Cincinnati, Ohio
Mr. Michael A. Crawford 
Hillsdale, N.J.
P.O. Box 27
APR 25 1961
FEDERAL BUILDING
Cincinnati 19, Ohio

Dear Sir:
The report of your sighting of an unidentified flying object in the 
vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, on 2 May 1961 has been received. 
This case has been assigned the case number 6639118, and the
information you provided has been made a matter of record.

There are certain factors which tend to make this type of sighting
somewhat difficult to evaluate. The phenomenon seen was of very
short duration, possibly only a few seconds, and this, coupled with
lack of corroborative evidence from other sources, makes the precise
identification of this object difficult, if not impossible.

However, a thorough analysis has been made of the details submitted,
and it is believed that this sighting does not constitute evidence of an
extraterrestrial visitation. The description indicates characteristics more
consistent with a natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or other astronomical
object, rather than with the maneuverable and intelligently-controlled devices
often associated with "unidentified flying objects."

Thank you for your interest in this matter.
Sincerely,
PHILIP G. STRONG
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science and Components
