j. The location of the sighting is in the general area of the Tokyo International Airport and August Naval Air Station.

k. It appears that the referenced sighting being in the vicinity of two large operating airfields could possibly be a high flying aircraft. This, however, could not be confirmed. Friendly air traffic craft. In addition, identification is not carried on Air Defense plotting boards after initial action because of the large number of such tracks processed. In addition, under normal conditions no requirement exists to show such tracks.

In talking to the individual making the report, this is presently an active hobby as evidenced by an attached copy of another report made by the same individual on 28 August 1965 (atch 1). I questioned the individual as to why this sighting was reported to Fifth Air Force.

Quote: The Fifth Air Force issued a statement that any sightings of 'Unidentified Objects' would be reported to Headquarters Fifth Air Force. Unquote. The individual, also stated that he nightly when he is off duty. It appears with the influx of new sightings being highlighted in the news personal are allowing their imagination to run rampant. As no additional reports have been received from the area from other sources these sightings could possibly be high flying aircraft.
