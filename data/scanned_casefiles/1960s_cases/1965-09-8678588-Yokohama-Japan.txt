h. Negative
1. Negative
2. Indication of the sighting is in the general area of the Tokyo
International Airport and Atsugi Naval Air Station.

This suggests that the observed sighting was in the vicinity of two large operating airfields, which could potentially be a high-flying aircraft. However, the report indicates that this could not be definitively identified. The sighting remains unidentified due to the large number of such tracks processed at this location and the observer's inability to provide more details.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with text and a signature at the bottom.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

In talking to the individual making the report, this is presently an active military case discussed by an attached copy of another report made by the same individual on 23 August 1965 (which questioned the individual in question as why this fight between two high school students for "Unidentified Objects" would be reported to Headquarters Fifth Air Force). The individual stated that this fight was photographed but the photographs could not be identified.
