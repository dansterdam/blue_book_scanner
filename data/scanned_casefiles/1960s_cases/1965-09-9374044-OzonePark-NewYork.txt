Mrs. Hunt/man/SAFOICC/T2842/27 Sep 65

Dear Mr [redacted]

SEP 28 1965

This is in reply to your request for information on your aerial observation of 4 September 1965.

The description, duration, and direction of flight are characteristic of satellites. On 4 September, Echo II was traveling northeast of New York at 7:28 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. If the time of your observation was Eastern Daylight Time, the object you observed was Echo II. If the time was not Eastern Daylight Time, then you probably observed one of the other 30 satellites or metallic components which are visible to the naked eye.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING

If this is not the case then he probably observed one of the other thirty satellites and satellite components in orbit which are visible to the naked eye.

There is a large black redaction bar at the bottom of the document that obscures some text.

The document appears to be a handwritten page, likely from a report or correspondence, with some words and phrases difficult to fully discern due to the image quality and handwriting.
