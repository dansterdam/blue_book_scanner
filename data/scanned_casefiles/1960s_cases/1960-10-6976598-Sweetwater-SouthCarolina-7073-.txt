The object was observed by the witness, Mr. John Smith, for a period of approximately 15 minutes. The object was described as round in shape, about 30-40 feet in diameter, and metallic in appearance. It hovered at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above the witness's location. No sound was reported. The object eventually accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.
