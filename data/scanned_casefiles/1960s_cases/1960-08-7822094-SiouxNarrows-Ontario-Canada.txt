Extracted text:
Dear Sirs:
A certain sighting of August 29, 1960 has come to my attention that I wish to relate. The visual contact occurred on the night of August 28 while I was returning home from Kenora to Sioux Narrows. The sighting lasted 90 or 100 seconds later, after which it disappeared with the speed of a shooting star. The object seemed to be aluminum in color and was brighter than the moon. It descended to an object behind trees. Cyans.
Signature: Certain details.
