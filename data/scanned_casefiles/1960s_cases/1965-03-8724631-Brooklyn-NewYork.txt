AS WITNESSED BY

DEAR SIR,

ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 12, 1965
AT 4 A.M. NEW YORK TIME, A MOST
REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE.

I HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN UP RATHER
LATE THE NIGHT OF THE 11TH (MARCH) AND
WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE TO BED, AND WAS
GAZING BRIEFLY UP AT THE STARS. IT WAS
A VERY CLEAR NIGHT (MORNING). I SAW
WHAT APPEARED TO BE, A FAIRLY BRIGHT
STAR, EITHER STARTED FROM A STANDING
POSITION OR ALREADY HAD BEEN MOVING
VERY SLOWLY DUE SOUTH I BELIEVE, OR
PERHAPS SOUTHEAST, IN ONE GENERAL
DIRECTION. I CALLED IN MY WIFE, TO
VERIFY WHAT I THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN 'ILLUSION'. SHE TOO SAW THE OBJECT
MOVING. IT WAS EXACTLY AS THOUGH A
STAR WERE DRIFTING IN SPACE, NO
SMALLER NO LARGER, JUST A WHITE
SPARLING GLOW, ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS
VENUS WHEN IN POSITION.

Brooklyn 37, N.Y.

Here is the text from the document:

Finally, it disappeared over the rooftops out of view from my kitchen window. Less than a half hour later, surprisingly so, I spotted another star(?) moving just as slowly, only from another direction this time.

This time I was perceptive enough to run and get my telescope and tried to focus it before it disappeared. Unfortunately, it is not a very powerful scope but none the less I was able to see what looked like a flat-side object, either like a half-moon or a letter 'D'. I was only able to see this for a matter of seconds. Blast it all!

On the very next night(or again, morning) March 13, 1965, at 5 AM, after waiting patiently for exactly one hour, to perhaps see another such event take place, I was suddenly,

Here is the text from the document:

Remembered. Gal there in the sky, coming from the same direction as the second time the previous morning, was another "what-cha-ma-call-its".

Well, what has stunned me most, from the whole experience, is that, this time the "star" stopped somewhere way off to my left, being, I believe, about northeast. It was only for a couple of seconds, but I don't believe my eyes deceived me, as I have very good vision -20/20. It then proceeded to move again and before long, it also vanished over the horizon.

Now I am not a true-blue astrologist, but I always have had a deep interest in the universe and its mysteries. It seems that I must know or at least have an idea what it was, I could have seen on these two occasions.

It would please me immensely, if
you could give me some sort of an
explanation in this matter. In addition,
if there is ever any possibility for
any position in either your organization,
or another such outfit, will you kindly
consider me as a potential? Thank
you very much. Please don't consider
this last remark the works of a prank.

Yours truly,

P.S. I completely forgot to mention that
I read the article written by Richard
Lewis - Special to the Long Island Press
from the Chicago Sun-Times, on March
17, 1965, a little too excited I guess)
Sorry.

Dear Major:

4. Could Marilyn answer this letter (enclosed) from
and [redacted] I don't have any time schedules on tap
right at the moment, but obviously what they saw was a satellite. The momentary stopping, of course, is our usual physiological phenomenon. I wish people would stop reporting satellites!
