Echo Timetable
Echo 1 satellite will be visible today at 8:50 p.m. in the north, 63 degrees above the horizon moving in a northeasterly direction; at 10:08 p.m. in the north, 52 degrees above the horizon moving in a southeasterly direction; tomorrow at 8:15 a.m. in the south, 37 degrees above the horizon moving in a southwesterly direction and 9:15 a.m. in the south, 16 degrees above the horizon moving in a southeasterly direction.

Trip In Shadows
Seen Having No
Effect On Echo
WASHINGTON, Aug 28 --UP)-- NASA officials said today that the balloon satellite suffered no ill effects from its quick trips through the Earth's shadows.

The satellite, launched Aug. 4, began beginning to move more easily as it passed through the shadow, bringing a temperature change in its tracking system, but this had no apparent effect on the balloon.

But a spokesman for the mission said that at midday today it was continuing to move into the shadows for only 8 minutes at a time. Echo 1 will continue going into the shadows for longer periods, but its maximum in December will only be 36 minutes of darkness.

When longer than 8 minutes, the NASA spokesman said, one of the two batteries of the Z-axis experiment will be used to keep the satellite's temperature from dropping too low in the Earth's shadow.
