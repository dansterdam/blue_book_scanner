The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a clipping of text from what appears to be a report or article. The text is titled "Echo Timedata" and discusses two topics: "Trip in Shadows" and "Effect on Echo".

Here is the text found in the document:

ECHO TIMEDATA
Echo Timedata will be returned each week as soon as possible. The period ending in a northwest direction at 4:30 a.m. in the south, was not processed for the previous 10 days due to technical difficulties. The next week should be clear.
