The image appears to contain two sketch illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and the text instructs the viewer to imagine the object's height above the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger scenes - one with a person standing on a road, and the other with a small object in the sky. The text refers to these as "larger sketch pieces" and asks the viewer to compare the object's position to the examples provided.

In the text, it appears to be instructions or questions related to a UFO sighting report, likely part of the Project Blue Book archives.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line on the horizon with an object above it, representing an object hovering above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a rural road with trees and buildings in the background. The third sketch shows a person standing on a road with a hilly landscape in the distance.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
