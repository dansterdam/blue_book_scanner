June 11, 1963

Mr. Robert McNamara
Secretary of Defense
Pentagon Building
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I was on the Edens Highway between Skokie and Highland Park, Illinois on June 8, 1963 at approximately 9:30 P.M. when I saw a very brightly lit rotating object at about 2,000 feet high which had brightly lit up portholes all the way around it. I would like to know if you can tell me what this object was?

I am 11 years old and my father, 15 year old brother and a cousin all witnessed this event with me.

Thank you very much for your trouble.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
Detroit 19, Michigan
