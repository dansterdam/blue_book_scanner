J. A 100 GRAM WEATHER BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED AT KANAWHA COUNTY
AIRPORT BY THE US WEATHER BUREAU AT 1825 EASTERN STANDARD TIME
(132527).


- page 4 -

AN OBSERVER' LOCATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES SOUTH OF KANAWHA COUNTY AIRPORT' SIGHTED AN OBJECT AT 1401452' HIGH OVERHEAD MOVING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION. AT 1323252' THE US WX BUREAU LAUNCHED A 120 GRAM WEATHER BALLOON FROM KANAWHA COUNTY AIRPORT. THE BALLOON WAS UNDER OBSERVATION FOR TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES DURING WHICH TIME' DUE TO RELATIVELY LOW WINDS ALOFT IT REMAINED OVERHEAD IN THE IMMEDIATE CHARLESTON VICINITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IT REACHED A MAXIMUM ALTITUDE OF 25000 FT. WINDS ALOFT FORECASTS FROM 32NRCC WEA WOULD INDICATE THE BALLOON ON A SOUTH-EASTERLY COURSE. THE ALTITUDE AND OVERHEAD POSITION OF THE BALLOON WOULD MAKE IT HARD

PAGE FIVE RJESKBP 2
FOR THE OBSERVER TO DETERMINE ITS ACTUAL COURSE. DUE TO THE RE-
PORTED DESCRIPTION AND WX BUREAU INFORMATION I ASSUME THAT
THE WEATHER BALLOON WAS A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE SIGHTING.
