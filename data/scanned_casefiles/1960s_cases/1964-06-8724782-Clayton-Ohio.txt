This image contains a sketch diagram but no photograph. The diagram shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above it which appears to be a sighting of some kind. There is also a compass-like diagram in the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, place an "A" on the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
