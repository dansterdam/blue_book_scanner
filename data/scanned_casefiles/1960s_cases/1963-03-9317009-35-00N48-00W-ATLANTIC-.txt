The document appears to be a data table with satellite tracking information. The table has columns for various dates (March 19, 20, 21, and 22, 1961) and includes numerical coordinates and other data points. The headers suggest this is tracking satellite positions and related information. Due to the dense numerical nature of the document, I cannot reliably transcribe all the specific numbers and coordinates without risking introducing errors. The document looks like a technical tracking log with precise measurements across multiple dates.
