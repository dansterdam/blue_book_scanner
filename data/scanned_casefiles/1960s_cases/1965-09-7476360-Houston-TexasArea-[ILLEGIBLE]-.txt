17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

a) 1/2 of the 30 objects (by each individually)
b) all of the second object (singular object)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document contains three numbered instructions with accompanying diagrams and space for drawing responses, along with a compass rose and sketches of landscapes and object movements.

25 Sept 1965
(week not clear)

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    30   Dec    1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The questions are not adequate enough for my story. I was walking window and I looked up to see about 30 objects which appeared to be geese. However closer looking showed the objects were not to be acting as - birds (the wings weren't flapping). It's hard to explain by writing it but they had none of the characteristics of a bird (no movement of the body itself). They appeared to be hitting into each other. They flew in a circle and at the same time were gaining height. I went in after watching for about 3 minutes from the time I first saw them (maybe 1 minute) and got my telescope. I came out 1-2 minutes later & they were out of sight. I then noticed an object like a dim star moving from about the spot the 30 objects had seemed to rise to. The flight object moved in a northern direction. My father also saw the 30 objects (OVER)


- page 6 -

Here is the text from the document:

The bright object I saw must be those discussed. Now some leaves the were bowing not far from me. And I saw a number of saucer fly over me. It is reasonable to allow for the fact bright object might have been an ark. However I clearly saw the approximately 30 objects which, by the time I returned outside, were gone. My father also saw these 30 objects (he only watched for about 30 seconds). He did not see the bright object - Again it is very possible that it was an ark (the bright object I mean)

That's about the best I can do - the drawing should not be as fat - the objects were streamline

UFO activity has slowed down considerably and I therefore held the reports until I had enough to forward.

        ATTN: Major Hector Quintilla

I am forwarding the reports received in the Houston area since 26 October 1965 for your information only. I do not feel any of them are unusual enough to justify complete investigations based on previous experience. UFO activity has slowed down considerably and therefore I had enough to forward. I will continue with this procedure just to give you an idea of the UFO activity in this area. I will forward any very unusual reports immediately after completion of local investigation.
