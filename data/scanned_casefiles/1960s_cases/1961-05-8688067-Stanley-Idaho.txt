We were on a reconnaissance trip Custer Creek to locate a likely spot of light and dark. The day was partly cloudy, windy. We stopped to just and inspect a bridge over a small creek. To the north and east to the east we saw the objects all colored at first white, then dark, then white. We saw the objects or apparitions all around on the horizon. The objects compressed sideways estimated about 50 meters appear to move up and down. They appear to hold a rigid shape while performing erratic maneuvers, oscillating, disappearing and reappearing where we had estimated they had been. The objects made no sound. They appeared to be at varying distances and elevations from us. We observed the objects for about an hour and a half to 2 hours time. The objects finally disappeared to the east.

The image appears to contain a chart or diagram of Mars, showing its visibility during May and June. The text discusses the distance and brightness of Mars during this time period. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

MARS ONLY PLANET NOW VISIBLE
The magnitude stars are conspicuous to the unaided eye during May evenings. Mars is nearly 100,000,000 miles away. The brightest object in the sky this May is Saturn which is some 800,000,000 miles away as it now appears about 35 degrees from the sun. The disc of Mars, which is part of the inner planets, is now becoming very circular or nearly round. As the Earth moves rapidly toward the outer planets, Mars appears to be receding or moving farther away. On May 15th, for example, Mars will be about 93,000,000 miles away. By May 31st it will be about 98,000,000 miles distant. On June 15th, Mars will be about 103,000,000 miles from the Earth. And it is getting larger. Under good atmospheric conditions it may be possible to observe some of the surface details on Mars with a good telescope.

Use Steroids Cautiously, Pediatricians Warned
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Food and Drug Adminstration has warned pediatricians to use steroids cautiously in the treatment of children. The Administration pointed out that steroids can have serious side effects, especially in children, and should be used for short periods of time only when absolutely necessary.

No Lower Limit for Radiation Damage 
THERE IS NO LOWER LEVEL of radiation exposure that is completely safe. The smaller the exposure, the smaller the effect, but there is no dose so low that it can be considered totally harmless. This conclusion is based on the latest scientific studies. At any level, radiation can cause genetic damage, cancer, and other health problems.

Dr. Gostl Warning
Dr. Michael Gostl of Los Alamos, New Mexico, warned recently that there is much too much emphasis on the possibilities of peaceful uses of atomic energy while the extremely serious dangers of radiation exposure are being played down or even ignored. He said that in his opinion many more lives would be lost through atomic radiation than would ever be saved through peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Origin of Oceans Seen Related to Solar Wind
THE OCEANS of the earth were formed, in all probability, by the action of the solar wind upon the primeval gaseous envelope of the earth, according to Dr. Thomas Gold of Cornell University.

Signa Seven - Hoax Chronic Alcoholics 
A new drugs has been developed, called Signa Seven, which is claimed to be a cure for chronic alcoholism. The drug does not actually cure alcoholism, however, but merely masks the symptoms. The Foundation for Full Recovery says that Signa Seven is a dangerous hoax that does more harm than good.

Transcription of the text in the document:

1. Memorandum to: Commander, Stead AF Base, Nevada
From: Major, Project Blue Book, ATIC
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object, Stanley, Idaho, 8 May 1961

2. Reference is made to your letter dated 15 May 1961, concerning the above-mentioned incident.

3. The details of this incident, as reported, have been reviewed and evaluated by this office. The following comments and conclusions are offered:

a. The description of the object, as given, appears consistent with that of a natural aerial phenomenon, such as a meteorological balloon. The observed color, behavior, and disappearance are typical of such balloons.

b. The duration of the sighting, approximately 10-15 minutes, is also consistent with the flight characteristics of such balloons.

c. The absence of any sound or distinguishing features, other than the observed shape and general appearance, provides further evidence that the object was a natural balloon-type phenomenon.

d. The location of the sighting, Stanley, Idaho, is in a mountainous rural area, where atmospheric conditions are generally favorable for the flight of meteorological balloons.

e. The time of observation, shortly before sunrise, is consistent with the typical flight patterns of such balloons, which are often launched during the early morning hours.

4. In view of the above, it is concluded that the unidentified flying object reported in this incident was most likely a meteorological balloon.

5. Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Saw a brilliant light or object in the northern sky on the night of 5 May 1961 at about 9:15 p.m. It was observed from the highway and passed overhead moving rapidly in a northerly direction. It appeared to be descending or tilting at an angle. No sound was heard. The object was fairly large and brilliant in color.

MAY 22, 1961. IT IS A.M. ON MONDAY, MAY 22, 1961, AN OVOID ALUMINUM COLORED OBJECT 50 FEET IN DIAMETER SILENTLY OVER A THINLY POPULATED AREA OF SANTA TERESA DEL TUY SIXMIN(?)SOME 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CARACAS, AND LANDED ON A HILL NEAR THE SITE OF EARTH-MOVING OPERATIONS IN THE AREA. DARILED ENGINEERS, TOPOGRAPHERS AND A POLICE OFFICER THEY SAID IT GAVE A PATH OF LIGHT IN THE AIR AND DROPPED TREES AND FLYING IT ALONG SOME 25-30 FEET IN THE AIR OVER A STRETCH OF "GAMELOTE" GRASS. ONE OF THE OBSERVERS STATED THAT AS HE WAS CATCHING UP WITH IT JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT DUCK BEHIND A HILLOCK, AS WELL AS THE ROAD HE SAID HE GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAD REACHED A BEND IN THE ROAD. FURTHER IN THE DISTANCE, ON REACHING THE SPOT LATER, HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE TALL GAMELOTE GRASS COVERING THE GROUND WAS FLATTENED TOWARD THE CENTER OF A CIRCULAR AREA ABOUT SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER. ANSWERS TO INQUIRIES BY INVESTIGATORS INDICATED THAT THESE SIMILAR OBJECTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED TRAVERSING THE SAME ROUTE THE DAY BEFORE. AN ITALIAN LIEUTENANT AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT CORPS, ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. HE TOLD SANTANA THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO A HELICOPTER BUT WITHOUT MOTORS AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING IN A SORT OF "WHITE CLOUD" WITH FUZZY EDGES CENTERED MOVEMENT INVESTIGATED AND FOUND THAT THE FLATTENED GRASS THERE PHOTOGRAPHED THE AREA, AND FURTHER EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT THE ROOTS OF THE GRASS APPEARED TO BE BURNED.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick held at arm's length. If you had not performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick held at arm's length?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? A long, gradual disappearance while moving straight away would suggest a high altitude and great distance.

24. In order that you can give as precise a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Somewhat similar to the daylight moon, but larger and more definite. Biggest tips about 1/4 minute of arc.

This image appears to contain three drawings or sketches, but no photographs.

The text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
