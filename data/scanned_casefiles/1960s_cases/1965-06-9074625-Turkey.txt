M/R: Maj Groening contacted Sgt Moody stating that FTD had been directed to reply on this message. Wanted to know if this was the proper office. Agreed that it was. Sgt Moody contacted Mr Bryant (TDEED) regarding the radar portion.

He says it could not be a/c, report indicates that returns could be caused by the transmitting xxxx signal as indicated in paragraph two of the message.

Did not think it was a malfunction due to the fact that sight returns were received. If a device would have triggered the information on such a device, if known to exist, would be obtainable from Mr Gould, ext 72131. Mr Bryant feels that a solid object isn't the cause of the returns.

The visual portion of the sighting - No conclusions can be reached as to whether the visual observations coincide with radar returns. Satellites are ruled out if the visual objects are consistent with the radar returns, that is if the heading is towards 230° (Southwesterly) Aircraft are also ruled out if the reported speeds are correct. In order for an evaluation of the visual sightings, additional data would be required.
