Volley ball with an amber-red color on its lower side. Plane F-106 at Wichita Falls on an outbound heading of approx 16°. At altitude 6500'. Object was sighted approx 20 miles away. Object descended slowly away from a/c course of approx F/33. No trail or exhaust or sound. At approx 03242 obj disappeared toward ground. About 13292 another red flash. Glows disappeared about 04102.

11. COMMENTS
Coincides with the position of Venus at the time of the sighting. The planet was just rising and it is concluded that this was the principal cause of the misidentification. The description of the object and its motions are those which would be associated with an astronomical object subject to the effects of atmospheric refraction.

NAME:                                                                  (Do Not Write in This Space)

My wife and I were driving west on the Seymour Highway and were approximately one mile west of the city when we first sighted the object.

At first glance it appeared to be an unusual vehicle. After a brief but a second look quickly convinced us that this object was no conventional aircraft. It was too large to be a star vehicle, and the object was moving. Our first sight of it was to our right and it appeared to be moving toward the south, fast, somewhat like a channel 5 TV station. I located on the north side of the highway about three miles west of the city.

At this point we drove off the highway and stopped to view the object better. While we were close, the object appeared to be hovering, directly above the west point of the city.

This was at about 1815 hours. The object appeared to be no more than 1500 or so feet ahead of us. At about altitude and appeared to be no more than 1000 or so feet ahead of us.

The object then began to move again in a northwesterly direction and we followed it. Proceeding on our highway and at a point of the county of the Southwestern course.

A town near Olney, this area is farm land. We observed the object continuing with what seemed to our sight to be a very slow motion. We arrived at our home which is located in the city of Olney, Texas, and continued to observe the object.

While observing the object (which was in the northwest direction), we noticed an airplane flying in the same general direction. The airplane followed a course which seemed to be parallel to the object's course. We got into our car and drove out of town. An airplane building, the object, some distance, called it approximately 1/2 mile north of the city. We could see the object ahead of our plane and some distance, very clearly.


- page 32 -

Here is the text from the page:

although gradually diminishing in light intensity at the very least, before the object disappeared the light was still quite bright. It was over 20° to 30° off the ground and more reddish in color -- as it had been its disappearance from our view. We could not tell for sure whether it had "handmade" or had disappeared over hills or some landscape.

REPLY TO
ATTN: CR: TA-3                                                18 January 1961

SUBJECT: UFOs

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB, 
Texas on 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 January. Not all of these sightings 
were related.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren R. Aiken and 
Major Donald F. Taylor as they proceeded from the area of Altus AFB, 
Oklahoma to Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Incl #1). Major Aiken and Taylor 
appear to be highly reliable sources. Major Aiken has had much experience in investigating UFOs, and his conclusion, that the object he observed 
was probably a satellite or a piece of rocket or satellite entering the 
earth on an orbital path, appears to be sound. No other sightings of 
this object were reported.

3. Reference my message of 13 January TAI702A concerning 10 January 
sighting. Many ground sightings correlate highly in the description 
and the path of the object sighted by Mr. _______ and Mr. _______ in 
the aircraft (see Incl #2 and #3); but, since these reports were 
received by the official channel, the preparing officer was not able to obtain only two witnesses' names. The testimony obtained was relatively weak, and the description was not sufficiently veridical. Consequently the description and path of the object sighted from the aircraft (see Incl #4). The cause and identity of this object remain undetermined.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs. _______ whose 
judgment and reliability seem questionable. It is significant that 
the sighting took place on the day that the local paper headlined the 
10 January sighting. Mrs. _______ overly insisted that she 
saw this strange object (see Incl #5) and she described it as "star 
shaped," the much-used description for UFOs. She left the sighting 
somewhat hastily to get her husband to see the object, and was observed 
the sky together neither one saw the object. Further, no other persons 
reported seeing this object, which seems unlikely if it hovered in the 
sky for 30 minutes only a few miles away. It is the preparing officer's 
conclusion that the object was an illusion, or that Mrs. _______ was 
seeking publicity.

5. Mr. _______ for KFDX-TV, Wichita 
Falls, reported that he saw an extremely bright object in the southwest as he drove from Munster, Oklahoma to Frederick, Oklahoma (see


- page 37 -

atch #6). Judgment and reliability seem high. There were no other reported sightings of this object. The preparing officer is unable to estimate the cause or identity of this object.

On 15 January from approximately 03152 to approximately 03302 and other employees of KFDX-TV sighted from the location, on the southeast end of Wichita Falls, an object at about 1500 and 100 from the horizon. The object appeared to be as the sighted 14 January (see atch #6), except that it did not emit a glow like intervals. The preparing officer is unable to determine the cause or identity of the object.

LEVEL SITE, STATING THAT THE OBJECT WAS AN AIRCRAFT IN TROUBLE,
THE PILOT TOOK UP A COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 270DG, NORTH SEEKING
TEXAS IN PURSUIT OF THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT DESCRIBED SLOWLY AWAY
FROM THE AIRCRAFT ON A COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 270DG, THE PILOT
SAID THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VOLLEY BALL. NEITHER
FUSELAGE NOR WINGS COULD BE SEEN. EXHAUST, OR SOUND FROM THE
OBJECT. THE SKY WAS PITCH DARK AND THERE WAS NO CLOUD COVERAGE.
AT APPROXIMATELY 1542Z THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED TOWARD THE GROUND,
AND ABOUT 12 SECONDS LATER SAW A PFD FLASH ON THE GROUND
NEAR BENJAMIN, TEXAS. AT THIS TIME THE AIRCRAFT WAS ABOUT 30
MILES FROM BENJAMIN. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TOWARD A RED GLOW AT
THE POINT OF THE FLASH AND AT ABOUT 1552Z SAW ANOTHER PFD
FLASH ON THE GROUND THEN, BUT FUSELAGE, WHO WAS HAVING SOME
DIFFICULTY FLYING WITH INSTRUMENTS, OBSERVED THE OBJECT ONLY WHEN
IT WAS IN THE AIR AND THE FIRST FLASH OF LIGHT. THE AIRCRAFT
CONTINUED TOWARD THE TWO RED GLOWS, WHICH THOMAS OBSERVED FROM
A POSITION DIRECTLY OVERHEAD AT APPROXIMATELY 5557005581400, ABOUT

REPLY TO
ATTN CF: TA-3                                                 18 January 1961

SUBJECT: UFOs

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB, Texas on 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 January. Not all of these sightings were related.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren M. Aiken and Major Donald P. Taylor as they proceeded from the area of Altus AFB, Oklahoma to Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Atch #1). Major Aiken and Taylor appear to be highly reliable sources. Major Aiken has had much experience in investigating UFOs, so his conclusion, that the object he observed was probably a meteorite or a piece of rocket or satellite entering the earth on an orbital path, appears to be sound. No other sightings of this object were reported.

3. Reference my message of 13 January TA17024 concerning 10 January sighting. Many ground sightings corroborate highly in the description and the path of the object sighted by [redacted] and [redacted]. Verification reports were received by the offices of local news media, the preparing officer was able to obtain only two witnesses' names. The testimony obtained from [redacted] who is considered reliable, verifies investigation of the description and path of the object sighted from the aircraft (see Atch #4). The cause and identity of this object remain undeterminable.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by [redacted] whose judgment and reliability seem questionable. It is significant that this sighting took place on the day that the local paper headlined the 10 January sighting. [redacted] was an eyewitness overly insistent that he saw this strange object (see Atch #5) and she described it as a "cigar shaped," "metallic" and "gleaming." She left the sighting area 50 minutes only a few miles away. If is the preparing officer's conclusion that the object was an illusion, or that [redacted] was seeking publicity.

5. Mr. [redacted], programmer and weatherman for [redacted], Wichita Falls, reported he saw an extremely bright object in the southwest as he drove from Hunter, Oklahoma to Frederick, Oklahoma (see


- page 51 -

Here is the text from the document:

Atch #5). Mr. [redacted] judgement and reliability seem high. There were
no other reported sightings of this object. The preparing officer is
unable to evaluate the cause or identity of this object.

6. On 15 January from approximately 03152 to approximately 03302
Mr. [redacted] and other employees of KFDX-TV sighted from the
station, on the southwest end of Wichita Falls, an object at about
3500 and 105 from the horizon. The object appeared the same as the
one sighted 15 January (see Atch #5), except this time with a
real photo in interval. The preparing officer is unable to determine
the cause or identity of the object.
