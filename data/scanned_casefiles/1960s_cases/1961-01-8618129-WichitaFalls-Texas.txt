UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Wichita Falls, Texas
Date (Local): 10 Jan 65
Hour (Local): 2215
Hour (Z Time Group): 0215
Satellite: (Det 5 ATIC, Ext 3279)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): STELLAR OBJECT
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-AEI): N/G
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): ___ 
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: ___ 
Other: ___ 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: REASONABLE
Analysis and Conclusions: The OBJECT was observed approximately 35-45 degrees elevation in a low position in the WNW sky. The object appeared larger than a star, oval in shape, and bluish-white in color. The object made no sound and appeared to be gradually moving slightly upward. The estimated distance to the object was about 45-60 miles. This was based upon its apparent size and the fact that Stars in about that direction and elevation were dimly visible. Apparently the observation was of a stellar object, possibly a planet or comet, and was not of a closer, artificial object.

NAME: [Redacted]
CODE: 
DATE: 1-16-61

On the night of 1-16-61 at approx. 6:00pm my wife and I were driving west on the Seymour highway about 5 miles west of Wichita Falls Texas. We were approached by an object in the sky which appeared to be moving at an extremely high rate of speed and at what appeared to be an unnatural altitude. The object, which was round in shape, appeared to be hovering or stationary in the sky, and as we continued to watch it we could see it start to move again at this high rate of speed. The object changed direction several times and would hover or become stationary at various intervals during its flight. The colors of the object ranged from a bright white to a reddish orange. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a quarter held at arm's length. There was no sound associated with the object. We continued to observe the object for approximately 5-7 minutes before it disappeared from our view. During the time we observed the object there were no other aircraft in the immediate area, and the object did not appear to be an aircraft, missile, or satellite. We have no explanation for what we observed, and this is the first time either of us has ever seen anything like this before.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a blank page with a text block that takes up the majority of the space.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Although gradually diminishing in light intensity, the object, according to the witnesses, could be clearly seen in the sky, and its position was not changing. However, it was red in color and had a definite shape, and this appearance did not conform to the light quality usually associated with searchlights and aircraft. The sighting lasted for approximately 20 minutes and the object disappeared gradually.

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2315
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The object was apparently in view during the early afternoon, but no one else saw it until the observer and his wife saw it at around 2315 hours. This object was circular in shape, was bluish-green in color, and was observed for about 30 minutes. The object moved very slowly, almost imperceptibly, during the early afternoon, but was motionless during the time it was observed by the observer and his wife. No sound was heard. Newspapers reported a sighting which could have been the same object, but due to there being one witness, the report remains partially unresolved.
13. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient Data to Evaluate

6. Statement from Mr.

On 15 January from approximately 0315Z to approximately 0330Z an unidentified flying object was sighted by several reliable witnesses from the base horizon to approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. The object was described as circular, bright orange in color and appeared to be slowly moving in a horizontal direction toward the northwest. The attached statements are based on information received from witnesses to the incident. The results of the preliminary investigation indicate that the number of witnesses, the reliability of the observing personnel, the common description of the object, and the correlation of sightings tend to lend credence to the report. However, no determination of the exact nature or identity of the object can be made since the causes or identity of the observed phenomenon are unable to be determined.

PAGE Two i-35797-371
NOTED THAT THE OBJECT VAS AS BRILLI/iNT AS A WELDER'S TORCH. THE PILOT GAVE CHASE AND FOLLOWED THE OBJECT FOR A COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES. THE OBJECT FLEW AT A MUCH HIGHER SPEED THAN THE AIRCRAFT AND WAS OBSERVED TO CLIMB SHARPLY AWAY FROM THE AIRCRAFT ON A COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 1750.THE PILOT SAID THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF THE EXHAUST OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE WAS NO SMOKE OR TRAIL FROM THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS PACED LAKY AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN ITS COURSE. IT APPEARED TO BE SOLID IN STRUCTURE AND THE GLOW SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM WITHIN THE OBJECT. AT APPROXIMATELY 45,000 FT. THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED. THE GROUND OBSERVER STATION AT SHEPPARD, TEXAS, ALSO REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT AT THIS TIME. THE AIRCRAFT WAS ABOUT 30 MILES FROM SHEPPARD WHEN THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED ON TO ANOTHER MISSION. THERE WAS NO CLOUD COVER AND THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR. WITNESSES WHO WERE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY FLYING WITH INSTRUMENTS, OBSERVED THE OBJECT ONLY WHEN IT FLARED OR FLASHED ON THE GROUND. NEAR SHEPPARD, TEXAS, AT THIS TIME THE AIRCRAFT WAS ABOUT 30 MILES FROM SHEPPARD. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED ON TO ANOTHER MISSION. THERE WAS NO CLOUD COVER AND THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR. WITNESSES WHO WERE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY FLYING WITH INSTRUMENTS, OBSERVED THE OBJECT ONLY WHEN IT FLARED OR FLASHED ON THE GROUND. THERE WAS A BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT. WHICH THOMAS OBSERVED FROM A POSITION SLIGHTLY OVERHEAD AT APPROXIMATELY 1750. THE FLASH OR GLARE WAS ABOUT A MILE ACROSS AND IT SEEMED TO THOMAS THAT THIS FLASH CAME FROM THE GROUND. HE COULD SEE THE OBJECT MOVING AT THAT TIME.

AIRCRAFT CIRCLED AREA AT 8:15 PM WITH ITS FLASHING LIGHTS ON. AN ATTEMPT TO GUIDE MEN ON THE GROUND TO THE SCENE BY TURNING LIGHTS ON AND OFF WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE AIRCRAFT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT BECAUSE THE FULL SUPPLY OF GASOLINE WAS LOW, AND IT ALSO STOPPED RADIOING PERSONS ON THE GROUND. SEARCH WAS ONLY ABOUT ONE HOUR OF SEARCHING. WITNESSES ON THE GROUND SAY ANY UNUSUAL BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY OR ON THE GROUND. 20 PEOPLE AIDED IN AIRCRAFT CONTINUING THE SEARCH ON 17 JANUARY 1961 FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR. AFTER SEARCH ALL WEATHER PREPARLING OFFICER FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR TO SPECKAGE, GROUND HOLES, BURNT SPOTS, OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF THE OBJECT WAS FOUND. PROBABLE PHYSICAL DAMAGE WAS NOT A RESULT.  THERE WERE NO REPORTS OR EVIDENCE OF AN AIRCRAFT IN PROXIMATE REAL TIME SIGHTING.  THE PREPARING OFFICER AND WITNESS BEING REPORTED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT WHATEVER THE OBJECT AS THEY DESCRIBED IT, WAS NOT AND IS NOT CAPABLE OF AERIAL PERFORMANCE AND SPACE-CRAFT. THIS SIGHTING IS A SIMILAR ERPORT TO PREVIOUS LESS CONCLUSIVE SIGHTINGS.

1. Reports have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Wichita Falls, Texas on 8 January 1961. This is in reference to reports received by this headquarters from all of these incidents.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren D. Aikan and Major Joseph C. McAndrew, both assigned from the 4756th Radar Squadron (SC), at Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Atch 1) along with two civilian observers. Details of the sighting have been reported to ATIC.

3. Reference my message of 15 January FAILSAFE concerning 10 January and the path of the object observed by 1st Lt. William Haller and Airman 1st Class William Lohren at Wichita Falls. It is now considered that the preparation by the crew of the NFG-1 was probably the result of a piece of rocket or satellite entering the atmosphere. No other sightings of significance occurred.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs. T. as significant but investigation discloses that the light objects observed were probably stars in the night sky. Intelligent reports received from other observers indicate that she saw only the distant stars.

5. Mr. [redacted] was the programmer and weatherman for KNCT-TV, Wichita Falls, who reported he saw an unusual object in the southwest bright white lights as he drove from Huntsville, Oklahoma to Frederic, Oklahoma (see Atch 2).
