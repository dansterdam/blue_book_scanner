UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Erie, Pennsylvania
Date: 25 JAN 59   Hour: 0155
Witness: Jackson, Michigan
Description: Strange red, glowing, elliptical object. Crossed sky from east to west at high speed. Pulsated and changed color.
Direction of Motion: Horizontal - west to east
Satellite or Meteoro: (ARGN-HQ): Phone 6913 Positive. No identifiable satellites or meteors.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Meteors and comets can be ruled out, but planet Venus is a possible explanation.
Radar Analysis (ARGN-HQ): Radar return indicated an unidentified target.
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): No evidence of natural phenomena.
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: No such craft were observed in the area.
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: One wonders if weather conditions, such as temperature inversions, might have caused a mirage or refraction effect. No evidence of extraterrestrial visitation. Possibly an unexplained meteor or satellite re-entry.
