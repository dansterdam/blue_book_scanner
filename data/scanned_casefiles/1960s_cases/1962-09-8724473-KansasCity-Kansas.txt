10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two reports of object resembling satol-
lite decay from observers in different
parts of Kansas City, whose place of
employment was the same. Found or oval
object, yellow or amber, observed to be
3,000 feet over Kansas City descending
to 2,000 feet where it fell into small
pieces of burning light prior to falling
to ground. Flight started SW to NW.
Observed for 5 minutes.

11. COMMENTS
Both witnesses employed as postal
clerks and reporting official
indicated that possibility of
collision existed. Report made
two weeks after decay of Sputnik
IV. Since report was from city w/
large population, it is improb-
able that an event of this nature
would be observed by only two
people. In addition there were
no rpts fm air traffic in the area
at the time. Case considered fal-
sely related to population local
