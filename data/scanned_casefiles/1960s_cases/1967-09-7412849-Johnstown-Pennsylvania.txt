OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

May 24, 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

To whom it may concern:

My name is [redacted]. I'm in 10th grade. What I'm 'bout to write and ask you may be confidential, but hear me out.

On the night of Sept. 16, 1967, I had sited a satellite pass over head. Someone else had caught my eye. A very bright light was off in the distance. (In the horizon) It was the brightest light in the sky that night. While we (my cousin and I) watched the satellite I happened to look at this bright light again. It had risen (vertically) It gained altitude and seemed to follow the satellite. At about the mid-point where I had first sited it, and where the satellite was, the light dimmed to the brightness of any other star in the sky. (Diagram on other sheet of paper)

(For diagram) Point A is the place where first sited. Point B is the second sighting. Point C is the place where the bright light dimmed itself to the light of any other star in the sky. Point D is near the area of the satellite. The unidentified object gained speed and caught up to the satellite. The rate of change of the object's light, well, snap your fingers. That was the rate of change. If it is possible and isn't confidential, answer these questions:

1) On the night of Sept. 16, 1967, did a satellite seem to disappear?
2) How about the unidentified object; if possible, tell me; what was in the sky that night?

Send it to the address:
Johnstown, Penna. 15306

Sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]

P.S.-We also had a pair of binoculars on hand. (Not some cheap kiddie toy)

There are also some hand-drawn lines and markings on the page, including what appears to be a curved line and some directional arrows, but the text is mostly illegible or cut off.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn diagram or sketch with various lines, curves, and points labeled with letters such as A, B, M, and X. The drawing seems to be on a white or off-white background, and the lines are drawn in black ink. The image is somewhat faint and appears to be a scanned document from an older file. There are some additional markings and annotations on the sides of the page, but the text is too small or blurry to read clearly.
