11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a luminous or blue object which at times appeared very bright white in color. The object seemed to stop in mid-air light up very brightly as if it were on fire then shoot straight up into the air. The object was compared to that of a football in shape and size. The center of the object was flickering on and off at a very fast pace. One observer said that he could see 3-6 small lights in the center of the object. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation.

Certainly just was flickering for + off at a very fast pace. Also flying for its level for a few seconds then bright length then long stop, meteor, or satellite I have seen.

Could not have been a plane because it seemed to stop in mid-air could pause for maybe 1-2 minutes then to the off straight up into the air as a rocket. Got very good look at it.

Flickering stopped and it just sort of glowed during pause. Could see 3-6 small lights in color of object before it lit up again very bright and shot straight up. Flickering B lue - white light was very fast maybe 2 flashes per second.
