PL 0010 I was called by a

[name redacted] in downtown Dayton.

According to [name redacted], he and

[names redacted] were taking a

spotted the object.

The object was first seen at about

1202 according to their weather, and

was seen for a total time of around

1 1/2 minutes. At first, they thought
it might have been a satellite, but
the object did not behave as a
satellite would.

The object appeared to be
a bright rotating beacon of
white light that would vanish
and reappear. When first observed,
it was at an elevation of about
30° projected on a S.W. azimuth
(toward Cincinnati). It was
traveling at a high rate of speed.

in a horizontal path toward
Cincinnati until it reached an
elevation angle of about 65°.

It then stopped suddenly and
climbed vertically and then diagonal.

After losing sight, it reappeared
6 sec. later and descended on
the same path to a lower altitude
from which it was originally observed.

It was then noted that various
(about 7 or 8)
colored lights ("red, blue, green, white etc)
were located on the object below.

the rotating white beacon light.

These colored lights did not describe

any specific pattern, such as a

circle or square, but some were

concentrated more in the center of

the pattern.

After studying the lower altitude,

the object (now with the colored lights)

then darted traveled in a very

well curve around the Dayton area

at a very light rate of speed. The

told witnesses said it could have

went from South to West & North,
and then back to the South again.

The total time it took to complete
this orbit was only 7 minutes. It
returned to its original starting point,
and then headed directly toward

faded out of sight.

had watched aircraft taking off from

the base and within had well

gone that part or looked the

way the object looked at night.

He wanted to know if we had

seen anything on radar, and I told

him I would check.

its path, and asked them if they
had seen anything. They said that
nothing was on their scope during
the time period of the sighting, but
that a KC 135 was penetrating at
1225 from 25,000 feet. Mr. Elliott said
he would check with the KC 135 crew
to determine if they had seen anything,
and give me a call back if they
had.
