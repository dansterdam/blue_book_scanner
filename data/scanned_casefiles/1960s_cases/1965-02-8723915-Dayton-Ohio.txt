Description of the text:

"Sighting of the object continued as they passed, and stated they lost sight of it after approximately 15 minutes, but a K-135 was penetrating at that time, 1:35 am from 25,000 feet. My report only mentions this detail, that they would check with the K-135 crew to determine if they saw anything."
