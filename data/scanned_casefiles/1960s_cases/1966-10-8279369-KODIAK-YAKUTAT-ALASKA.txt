The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report that discusses a contact with a radiosonde balloon launch station in Kodiak, Alaska. The text describes that the sighting was not a balloon launched by the Japanese, as the balloon resembled those launched by the Kodiak station and did not appear to be launched from any of the other balloon release areas in Alaska.

OCR output:

12 Oct. 66

Contact with the Kodiak radiosonde balloon launch station, Kodiak, Alaska, (GBR-2313) revealed that the sighting was not a balloon launched by the Japanese. The balloon was launched by persons from the Kodiak area. The balloon resembled those launched by the Japanese. It was like a transonic balloon.
The balloon did appear to have been launched from any of the other balloon release areas in Alaska.

15 Dec. 66

From 02222 to 06512 9 Oct. 66 AFR radar tracked two slow moving objects which were moving toward the southeast at an average speed of 25 knots. A message was sent to investigate. The radar lost contact with the objects in the vicinity of Cape Romanzof, Alaska. The aircraft pilots were flying in bad weather and on three passes were unable to see the objects.

Investigating official from Elmendorf AFB, Alaska believes the objects to be balloons. Several balloons have been recently seen in the Alaska area. This balloon could have the one observed at 1045Z/6 Oct. 66 Prevailing winds from the Cape Romanzof area to 02002/10 Oct. 66. At altitudes from 25,000 to 35,000 feet the winds were about 35 knots and could have carried an object from the Cape Romanzof area to Kodiak during this time frame.

UFO Report (ALNT Msg. 55304, 10 Oct 66)

TO: AFSC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. This office received a call on 10 October 1966, from Mr. [redacted], who sighted an unknown object at 10/1635Z, 10 miles south of Yakutat, Alaska (5930N/13945W). He was unable to determine size of altitude because of the long distance between himself and the object; but he did say it appeared to be a balloon.

2. We feel this may have been the same object as sighted at Kodiak Naval Air Station, Kodiak Island, Alaska, 10/0615Z, and reported in the referenced message. The size and altitude of the object at Kodiak Island is also listed as undetermined because of the long distance between the observers and the object; but it was reported that a free floating object at the altitude reported from Kodiak would have reached the vicinity of Yakutat at this time.

3. The original drawings and personal comments from observers at Kodiak are attached.

The image does not contain a photograph. The image is a page from an old UFO report document that includes hand-drawn illustrations and handwritten text.

Drone objects are estimated based on it being about 400' above ground larger than 12' diameter. 2 objects were observed, about 30 seconds apart. The objects climbed to 14,500' and then descended to about 3,000' scattered, over a 3 minute time period. The objects were still several hours and feet above the 50' object briefly observed once or twice through the spotty areas.

The image contains a sketch or illustration of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object is depicted as a rounded, egg-shaped form with a flattened top and undulating or rippling lines extending below it, suggesting some sort of energy or movement.

The text accompanying the sketch reads:

"CHINA PLASTIC LOOKING OBJECT WITH 21616 STREAMERS EXTENDING BELOW ENTIRE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OF A 21616 NATURE."

At the bottom of the image, there is a handwritten signature that appears to say "M. K. Gy. 1-12-62" followed by what looks like a partially illegible word or initials.
