skyhook balloon-ribbed lengthwise. Object appeared to drift
with the wind with the nose pointed in the direction of
movement. Object appeared to move over top of cloud layer
estimated to top at 12,000 ft. Looked like a plastic dry
cleaning bag. Description is consistent with that of a
balloon observation.

Object appeared translucent on the ribbed portion, opaque on the less shaded portion with a slightly darker portion in the center when viewed through binoculars (7x). Overall appearance suggested that the object was an extremely large balloon, purpose and duration unknown.

[The rest of the handwritten text at the bottom is partially illegible, but appears to read something like:
"I felt like a good day clearing sky clearing in the wind with a solid object in the center. Partial card was down wind or pointing toward the direction it was moving"]

There is also a hand-drawn sketch of an object labeled as "SILVER" with a "TRANSLUCENT WITH RIBBED APPEARANCE" and markings indicating it was viewed through binoculars.

Contact with the Kodiak radiosone balloon launch station, Kodiak, Alaska. (A67-3313) revealed that the sighting was not a balloon from the Kodiak area. The object was verified a balloon by several persons from the Kodiak area. The balloon resembled those launched by the Japanese. It was like a transonic balloon. The balloon did appear to have been launched from any of the other balloon release areas in Alaska.

15 Dec. 66

From 0222Z to 0651Z 9 Oct. 66 ANR radar tracked two slow moving objects which were moving toward the southeast at an average speed of 45 knots. Two F-102's were scrambled from Galena AFS was sent to investigate. The radar lost contact with the objects in the vicinity of Cape Romanzof, Alaska. The aircraft pilots were flying in bad weather and on three passes were unable to see the objects.

Investigating official from Elmendorf AFB, Alaska believes the objects to be balloons. Several balloons have been recently seen in the Alaska area. This balloon could have the one observed at a later time by the personnel at Kodiak Naval Air Station on 10 Oct. 66 0145Z. Prevailing winds from the Cape Romanzof area to the Kodiak area were counter-clockwise from 06002/9 Oct. 66 to 0200Z/10 Oct. 66. At altitudes from 25,000 to 35,000 feet the winds were about 35 knots and could have carried an object from the Cape Romanzof area to Kodiak during this time frame.

TO: AFSC (FTD)

1. This office received a call on 10 October 1966, from Mr. [redacted], co-pilot on Northwest Airlines Flight [redacted], who sighted an unknown object at 10/1635Z, 10 miles south of Yakutat, Alaska (5930N /139045W). He was unable to determine size or altitude because of the long distance between himself and the object; but he did say it appeared to be a balloon.

2. We feel this may have been the same object as sighted at Kodiak Naval Air Station, Kodiak Island, Alaska, 10/0145Z, and reported in the referenced message. Prevailing, high altitude winds over the Gulf of Alaska were such that a tree floating object at the altitude reported from Kodiak would have reached the vicinity of Yakutat at this time.

3. The original drawings and personal comments from observers at Kodiak are attached.

Here is the text from the document:

Dimensions are estimated based on seeing
more cloud layer in excess of 14500' high

Clear Plastic Bag open at bottom
closed at top. Not perfectly cylindrical
it looked partially collapsed

First viewed from the ground with 8x30
binoculars. it was above about a 3000'
scatter layer. It disappeared
above a higher layer.
I climbed helicopter to 14500'
and cloud layer it disappeared
above was still several thousand
feet above us. Saw object briefly
once or twice through the sort in
clouds. Estimate it in excess
of 20,000. Looked like a huge plastic
dry cleaning bag.
