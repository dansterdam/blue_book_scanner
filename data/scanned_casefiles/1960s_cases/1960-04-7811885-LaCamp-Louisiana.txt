Unidentified Flying Object Report Being Checked in Vernon Parish

LEESVILLE, La. - Investigators, Capt. Giles said today are continuing an investigation into reports of a mysterious flying object which reportedly landed Tuesday night near Leesville.

A report filed by Deputy Sheriff Oscar Haygood said the object, described as a platform-like craft, was seen whizzing through the sky and landed with an explosion that could be heard for miles around.

"The site of the landing was located about 8 miles south of LaCamp and about 25 miles east of Leesville. The object was described to me as being about eight to 12 by eight feet.

"After the dusk and dark period, a search was made from the Monroe Arnold home. When it hit the ground there was an explosion that could be heard for miles around.

"It was found on the ground in an easterly direction from about 100 feet. It was and landed near the top of a small hill. Playboys continued 'and places were a bit the ground it made an impression about the size of a car. The ground was scorched but did not burn the grass.

"It got the top out of a tree." the deputy said. "A small strange ball of fire was seen in the sky. When it rose it turned west."

Other details were not immediately available until the United States within the meaning of the National Security Act can be released.

Examination and Results:
The submitted samples (with the exception of the tree leaves and bark) were subjected to x-ray spectrographic study.

The material, much of which adhered to the inside of the container, was burned on a small plastic holder which was then inserted in the x-ray spectrograph. Strip charts were taken covering the range 2 degrees 2 theta. A tungsten x-ray tube was employed at 40KV, 35 MA. The strip charts were recorded at varying scale factors, depending on the quantity of certain available. A blank of the plastic holder was also run. The results obtained are as follows:

Sample #1 (C-1):
The only major element indicated was iron, with a very small trace of chromium.

Sample #2 (C-2):
There appeared to be less than 2 mg. Iron indicated as the major element; no other elements were detected.

Sample #3 (C-3):
Major amounts of iron, major amounts of zinc and a minor amount of chromium were indicated.

Sample #4:
The dark colored material which appeared to be rubbed or smeared on the surface of the ground indicated a minor to low major amounts of iron and a major amount of zinc. No chromium was indicated.

Conclusions:
It must be concluded from these studies that the dark material rubbed into the surface of the ground apparently did not come from any source coated from

STATEMENT

I, SSgt George D. Mallard was working 3rd Shift (2345-0545) on the 14th of April 1960, I had just worked a C-124 type aircraft out on Departure and checked his IFF equipment, also wire in the process.

I worked this A/C out approximately 35 miles and cleared him enroute.

I was sitting at the scope position talking to Tower on the land line for approximately 10 minutes more. I then hung up and was watching the Radar scope which was set on the 20 mile range with ten mile range marks.

I observed an GIF target coming in from the Northeast at approximately 9 miles out. It appeared the target was lining itself on the active runway, r/w 14. I immediately called and alerted Tower for a possible radio out aircraft. Tower looked for A/c and reported none. The GIF target came down the extended center line of runway 14 and disappeared in the vortex of the scope for approximately one minute and then I observed target going back out on a heading of 310° from the station still squeaking Modes 1 and 3 for positive identification. I changed my Mode selector to Mode 2 and target disappeared. I then turned my Radar Beacon off, and target disappeared. I then switched my selector back to Modes 1 and 3 and turned Beacon on again. The target was approximately 6 miles out on 310° radial. I called New Orleans center for A/c in vicinity of Alexandria and they reported none. I called local GCI site and asked them if they had the target on their weapon. They reported negative, but had GIF target ringing the scope. I kept tracking target until he was 29 miles to the Northwest in which time GCI never reported contact. The target then disappeared from my scope which has a capability of 40 miles radar coverage. I switched to the 200 mile IFF coverage scope and the only target within 200 miles squeaking the same Modes was approximately 150 miles away.

out on 310° radial. I judge A/C speed on outbound heading to a point
20 miles out at approximately 700 to 800 miles per hour. I base my
judgment of speed on my continuous working with high performance aircraft
and knowledge of radar blin movements. 2

Statement sworn to be true and factual.

AOJAX TWG, Englewood Cliffs, NJ                 TR-44-60

GENERAL INFORMATION DERIVED FROM
RESULTS OF HEARING HAVING HELD
ON 19 MAY 1960 BY DOCTOR J. A. HYNEK, AEROSPACE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

This report contains general information obtained from several persons who lived in the area near LaGrange, Louisiana. This follow-up information is supplemental to TR-44-60, (Ole Parish, MS) and was requested by Lt Michael Michaud on 19 May 1960 by Doctor J. A. Hynek, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, and collected on 20 May 1960 by Major Art F. Gonsior and Lt Robert F. Fitzpatrick.

[Several lines are redacted/blacked out]

He was asked if he could provide anymore information concerning his unusual observation on the night of 12 April 1960. He reviewed the entire incident with the preparer, attesting to his earlier detailed description. He did not vary on any points. He was asked if he had any ideas similar to the object. He said, "No way." He said that he saw, "He saw a 'WALL' of a similar container dropped from an aircraft to an earlier time, which failed to explode. He said that some 'parameter' had set it off after having found it and that it flew over the area hitting the ground near his place and took off again. He was vividly concerned with finding that 'cell' who did it and saving his with legal proceedings.

[Several lines are redacted/blacked out]

Age 28, Mechanic, Leesville

[Several lines are redacted/blacked out]

He said that he lives approximately 5 miles NORTHWEST of the UFO sighting. He said he did not hear the object nor did he see the object and heard it. He was asked if he had any ideas of what caused it or heard any remarks from other people on what might have caused it. He said that he hadn't discussed the matter very much but that he had heard over the radio, about the time of the incident, that US NAVY was conducting massive tests, down from the Gulf of Texas. He said that the reports were in the form of warnings to ships in the area. He was aware from the test area. He said he thought that this sighting was a run-away radar controlled missile. He was of the opinion that a radar guided missile could conceivably hit the ground and take off again. (This office has no way to inquire to the Navy about these related missile firings.)

Other Contacts:
(Other contacts were made with people in the general area. All contacts shared the same description of the sound as it passed over their houses; that it sounded 10% artillery shells passing overhead, but such a louder will high velocity artillery sound and low in altitude.)

COMMENTS OF THE INTERROGATING OFFICIAL

Having talked with people in the entire area it is almost certain that
the object seen in the area from the south east a deserted by section
below. All indications reflect that the objects on objects maneuvered off
sharply several times. Because of the many unoccupied sectors, it is
impossible to the preparatory official to identify with pinpoint accuracy
too many answers possible to attempt a guess. From the description of
the sounds it is possible that a high sharp metallic noise was involved. The
following is a memory sketch of the entire area where the sighting was made.
It is not to scale and may serve to clarify the location. This article is
used as a guide.

A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED. IT IS MY OPINION THAT SOME TYPE OF
ROCKET HIT THE GROUND AND THEN PICOCHETED OFF ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A WING-TIP COULD HAVE MADE THE IMPRESSIONS
ON THE GROUND, BUT I THINK IT IS VERY IMPROBABLE. THERE WAS
NO SIGN OF, OR PIECES OF ANY TYPE EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA AT THE
TIME OF THE INVESTIGATION. MR [REDACTED] A FIFTY (50) YEAR

Unidentified Flying Object Report

101st Tactical Fighter Wing
(USAF)
England Air Force Base, La.

1. References:

a. Letter to Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center from the Intelligence Division, 101st Tactical Fighter Wing, Subject: "Unidentified Flying Object Report," dated 22 April 1960. (Atch #1)

b. Intelligence Division Office Instruction #76, Headquarters, 101st Tactical Fighter Wing, dated 21 April 1960. (Atch #2)

c. SANG Supplement #1 to AFR 200-2, dated 27 January 1960. (Atch #3)

2. The procedure by which your organization is meeting the requirements of AFR 200-2, dated 14 September 1959, has been reviewed by ATIC. The methods are excellent and would be a good example for other USAF organizations to follow.

3. It is suggested that your office instruction (Atch #2) be expanded to include the following:

a. Appropriate action for investigators when physical evidence is located -

(1) If the object or its landing area is determined to be radioactive, it should be roped off, properly marked, and a guard posted. ATIC should be contacted by phone and made aware of the circumstances. Precautions are only necessary if the level of radiation is determined to be potentially dangerous.

(2) If the position of the object, relative to scarred ground, broken, crushed or turned brush, or any other evidence is indicative of a specific path, the area should be cordoned off. In such cases, due to the nature of the object, where this factor appears extremely important, the senior intelligence officer should contact ATIC by telephone to obtain its special training to preserve evidence.

b. In all instances where it is determined that radiation is present in excessive amounts all persons who are, or have been, in the area should be contacted.

SOIL PARTICLES

This report contains and describes the soil particles obtained from impact points where an Unidentified Flying Object was reported to have touched this ground. This information was reported by telephone on 19 May 1960, by 2d Tac Air Spt Gp, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, and collected on 20 May 1960 by 1st Lt. Robert P. Livingston.

The soil samples are attached to this report. The preparing officials took samples across west of JR-2660. The pieces of metal on samples were located in or around the holes. The attached photos will aid in the understanding of the peculiar characteristics of these particles are embedded in this soil around the entire area of the sighting. The reason for this is most likely that these particles fell in the area since the incident and it is a remote possibility that if these particles came from the holes they have been washed out of the holes due to heavy rainfall in the area since the sighting.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD                                                  21 April 1960

SUBJECT:  Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

1.  On 10 April 1960, a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the area of LaCamp, Louisiana at 0300Z (2100) local on 13 April 1960, was reported to ATIC by the Intelligence Division, MATS Hq, 2nd, England and photographic samples.

2.  The object was reported to have been seen by one witness, a farmer, and heard by many in the neighborhood. It was reported that the object was a round disc or sphere, appeared to be the size of a total at arm's length, and was a gray red. The witness stated that a loud rumbling noise followed by four or five explosions was associated with the object. The object was reported to have approached on an angle of approximately 100 elevation and an azimuth of approximately 165°. The duration of the sighting was approximately three seconds.

3.  The Wing Intelligence Officer of the 1601st TFW visited the area of investigation and determined that some object had hit the ground at some nine different points. (See Atch #1) In was informed that the object, due to a very high speed had skipped on the ground. A thorough search of the area, on Foot and by Helicopter, failed to reveal the object.

4.  Investigation of the points of impact revealed evidence that a foreign material had been scraped from the object. The opinion of the investigators is that the material is paint. (See Atch #1, Photo #2, Photo #3) The investigation further revealed that a trace in the path of the object was recorded. (Atch #1, Point #1, Photo #7) Samples of this evidence has been received at ATIC.

5.  On 21 April 1960, Major Friend of the Aerial Phenomena Group, AFOIN-LO3a, called the Intelligence Division, MATS Hq, England AFB, La. Contact was made with 1/Sgt Robert W. Plympton, who assisted with the investigation, and in answer to questions, that the local arc equipped with F-100 type aircraft. These aircraft are which are sometimes painted powder blue. The results have drawn warheads from local pilots, but no definite information was obtained from A-2, or the surrounding base, was able on the night of the sighting, and

- page 42 -

the witness did not report hearing an aircraft. The witness is familiar
with the sound of aircraft. England ADS does have a firing range, but it
is 25 - 30 miles from the area of the sighting, and is not used at night.
The aircraft of the MCLST and ADS were checked for inadvertent firing of
a rocket with negative results. No reading or the modified local was
made because of lack of equipment. The sheriff's office was checked, and
the one says witness was documented to be very reliable.

6. The physical evidence has been turned over to ir Charlie Maggie of
AFOIN-L2c for analysis.

of communication were used to lead witnesses to used to record
movement via very base line to this area. The 16 a Calculus area had
to carefully handled to prevent a panic.

4. In all instances where there is a possibility of a claim by a witness
that radiation is present, a reading of the radiation level should be
taken if instantaneous area arrival. In many UFO cases it is important
to be able to state definitely that radiation does not exist beyond the
expected small fluctuations of the normal background for the area.

5. Your organization is commended for the very fine investigation and
report of the UFO sighting which occurred at La Camp, Louisiana on
12 April 1960. Your excellent handling of this case will result in a
much more accurate and quicker analysis by ATIC. The healthy attitude
which your intelligence division has toward the requirements of AFR 200-2
can only help in overcoming public resistance to the UFO program and
the USAF in regard to the UFO program.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

21 April 1960

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

1. On 19 April 1960, a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the area of LaGamp, Louisiana at 0300Z (2100) local on 13 April 1960, was reported to ATIC by the Intelligence Division, 1015th TW, England AFB, LA. On 20 April 1960, this report was followed up with photographs and physical evidence.

2. The object was reported to have been seen by one witness, [redacted]. [redacted] reported that the object was a round disc or sphere, appeared to be the size of a nickel at arm's length, and was a dull gray red. The witness stated that a loud rumbling noise followed by four or five explosions was associated with the object. The object was reported to have approached on an angle of approximately 100 degrees and an azimuth of approximately 1650. The object disappeared immediately to the west. The duration of the sighting was approximately three seconds.

3. The Wing Intelligence Officer of the 1015th TW visited the area of the sighting, and ascertained that some object had hit the ground at some nine different points. (See Atch #1) In was the officer's opinion that the object, due to a very high speed, had skipped on the ground. A thorough search of the area, on foot and by helicopter, failed to reveal the object responsible for the sighting.

4. Investigation of the points of impact revealed evidence that a foreign material had been scraped from some object. The opinion of the investigators is that the material is paint. (See Atch #1, Point #2, Photo #3) The investigation further revealed that a tree in the path of the object was scorched. (Atch #1, Point #7, Photo #7) Samples of this evidence has been received at ATIC.

5. On 21 April 1960, Major Prioud of the Aerial Phenomena Group, ATIC-1623, called the Intelligence Division, 1015th TW, England Air Force Base, LA, Lowney, who assisted with the investigation of this case. Major Prioud was informed, in answer to questions, that the 1015th are equipped with an F-100 type aircraft that are marked with 2-750 rolling tail numbers. These rockets have a tendency to leave various colored powder blue. The ground in the area of points can be determined by clay. To aircraft from England AFB, or the surrounding bases, was aloft on the night of the sighting, and

The paint scrapings (contained under separate cover) were taken from the ground (reference Point # 2, Enclosure 1) at the impact area, coordinates 31°08'05"N, 92°54'24"W, where an unidentified flying object was reported to have touched the ground at approximately 0300 hours, 13 April 1960.

ENCLOSURE #3

DESCRIPTION OF RECOVERED TREE LEAVES AND BARK

A piece of scorched bark and a portion of scorched tree leaves (contained under separate cover) were taken from the tree (Reference Point # 7, Incl curve 1) at the impact area coordinates 31°05'00"N, 92°55'24"W, at approximately 0300 this 13 April 1960.

The leaves and the bark were evidently removed by the UPGS. This is evident because the leaves and bark are missing in one area of the tree only. The branch (Reference Joint # 7, Inclosure 3) that the officer is holding was broken off and laying beside the tree. It is not known if the UPGS did this or not.

The only text I can see in this image are some small handwritten annotations on the photographs, which appear to be numbers like "P-7", "P-8", and "P-9" placed at various locations on the landscape photographs. The image contains two nearly identical black and white photographs of what seems to be a rural or wilderness landscape with scattered trees or vegetation, with some slight variations between the top and bottom images.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TF/CO/INTEL                                     22 April 1960

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report

TO: Major Friend
    Air Technical Intelligence Center
    ATTN: AFTIN-464a
    Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. I appreciate very much the favorable comments you made on the phone to Major Robert F. Flynngon in reference to the UFO report submitted from this wing.

2. We feel that we have a very good set-up here in investigating and reporting UFOs. I have enclosed a copy of our latest office instruction on this subject. Several changes were made in the old office procedure.

3. Each intelligence officer and key NCO of this wing were in their possession at their homes, a copy of this instruction (including attachments), pencils, paper, road maps, etc. These aids are contained within an expansion folder for immediate use at anytime day or night, weekend or holiday. Several copies are also prepared for use at the office.

4. With all the publicity concerning space vehicles in orbit these days, we can expect an "upsurge" in UFO reports. We are doing everything possible-including CQT for intelligence personnel in investigation, techniques and reporting, and the enclosure of base and military personnel-so that we will be better able to comply with AFR 200-2.

5. It is requested that you review the attached materials for any additional and necessary comments toward approval, then

6. We feel that these aids have been of great help to us and if they will aid someone else, then we have done our part.

Sincerely

HEADQUARTERS, ACFT CENTRAL FIGHTER WING
English Air Force Base, Louisiana
21 April 1960

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO's)

1. REFERENCE: AFR 200-2, as supplemented.

2. PURPOSE:
    a. To explain the area of responsibility for investigating reports of
    unidentified flying objects.

    b. To provide a check list for Intelligence Officers to follow after
    receiving a report of an unidentified flying object.

3. AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY: From Gulf of Mexico, North along Sabine River to
    coordinates 31°54'N, 94°30'W. Then across Louisiana to Navy coordinates
    31°24'N, 94°34'W, Natchitoches, coordinates 31°24'N, 91°51'W, Antlers,
    31°54'N, 93°21'W, Water Proof, 31°05'N, 92°37'W, to the Mississippi River.
    From down the Mississippi River, South to Gulf of Mexico. (See to attached
    map).

    REMARKS: Although the area of responsibility is as outlined above, it may be
    necessary to conduct investigations beyond this area. In this event,
    the 19th ACCS will be the agency to be designated to avoid duplication of
    coverage.

4. CHECK LIST: In order that all possible sources of information are exploited
    concerning a particular sighting, the following check list should be used by
    the Intelligence Officer as a guide upon receipt of a report of an UFO:

    a. Contact 6352d AGC Squadron for any information they might contribute
    concerning a possible sighting. Also request any known air traffic in the area.
    (Extension 772).

    b. Contact the FAA at New Orleans by "hot line" through the 6352d AGC for
    any information regarding additional sightings and civilian and/or military air
    traffic in area at time of sighting.

    c. Contact 1900th (AGC) (MACON) for flight activity during the time of
    reported sighting. (Extension 207 or 349-classified number).

    d. Contact Base Tower for any air traffic in area of sighting at time of
    reported sighting. (Extension 797-classified number).

    e. Contact Base Weather Officer for weather in the area of sighting at
    time of sighting. Get all information required by regulation (attached 239).

- page 61 -

Here is the text from the document:

F. Contact as applicable the following officials in the area of sighting for leads, verification, source reliability, etc: Sheriff, City Police, State Police, Forestry and/or other local officials. Telephone numbers of local authorities are as follows:

(1) Sheriff's Office - HI 3277
(2) City Police - HI 21638
(3) State Police - HI 29933
(4) Forestry - HI 2626

G. If there is evidence or indications that fragments or materials of UFOs are in the area, be sure and take radiation detectors or call the base decontamination and radiation personnel for assistance.

H. Be sure and take with you on your investigation the following items:

(1) Binoculars
(2) Magnifying glasses
(3) Tape Measures
(4) Compasses
(5) Camera (for Base Photographers)
(6) Containers for physical evidence
(7) Blank UFO report forms
(8) Copy of AFR 200-2
(9) Portable tape recorder from CSI or HQ

I. If the above check list has been followed the "Investigator" will be in a much better position to conduct an "on-the-spot" survey or follow-up investigation. He also will be in as much better position to properly evaluate the information supplied by the person or persons making the observation.

this witness did not report hearing an aircraft. The witness is familiar with the sound of aircraft. England AFB does have a firing range, but it is 25-30 miles from the area of the sighting, and is not used at night.

the aircraft of the MATS and ATC were checked, and no inadvertant firing of a rocket with negative results. No radiation level was made because of lack of equipment. The sheriff's office was checked, and the one eye witness was determined to be very reliable.
