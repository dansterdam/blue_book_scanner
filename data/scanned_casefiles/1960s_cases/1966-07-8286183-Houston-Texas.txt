Gentle Men,

On the night of
July 8th, 1966 (approximately
11:55 PM) I spotted a
satellite at the zenith
progressing north, with a 6"
reflector telescope. I tracked
it for about a minute
before it seemed to be
to be progressing toward the
north horizon. It was
invisible to the naked
eye. Could you identify
this object?

Thank you

TO: Hq Foreign Tech Div (TDETR)

Reference the attached letter from which due to the relatively limited information on the sighting, it is difficult to identify the object in question with great certainty. However, taking into account the visibility and characteristics of objects in the vicinity of the sighting, we believe Mr. 1962B-PSI, saw SDC object number 519, international designator which is the upper stage (Scout) of a Transit-5A launch.
