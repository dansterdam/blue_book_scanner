UTAH-USA: 10/19/62 Utah Desert News and
Telegr. - This newspaper account of falling angels hair contained the picture of
Mr. Peter Bales, holding scene of the substance in his hand "first robs of a white
sticky material" from the sky on Oct.
18,62 and settled in bills and sheets and
thus is over much of the Utah Powerlight
company's Gadsby Plnt. Some places were
60-70 ft. long and gave the appearance of
tattered parachute, but the substance was
sticky & discolored into nothing when
stretched far enough. Some 50 employees
saw the material high in the sky.

"Spider Web" Falls On SLC
    The October 23, 1962 issue of the Golden Standard Examiner said that the
mystery of "gooey material" which fell
on Salt Lake City in the preceding week
had been "partly solved." Dr. Grant S.
Swann of the State Health Department
said the stuff was fibrous, burns but is
apparently "not hazardous." He said further tests would be made to attempt to
determine the material's origin.

    The "fiber" drifted down over Salt
Lake City on 17 October, coming out of
the north. It was described as "white
and sticky." Our question: It was headlined on the 23rd, couldn't it have
been identified as such after a week's
study?

In a brief statement occurring in a wide area around Delta, Colorado late in October, County Sheriff Joe McDaniel admitted that each evening around 5:45 one of the strange objects appears over a place called Grand Mesa and hovers in an easterly direction and hovers over the town of Cedaredge until late in the evening. Numerous people complained of three other objects which appear throughout the evening in this same area. Of the many sightings reported, the most interesting was that of an unidentified man near Fort Collins who said he saw a gray, disc-shaped object come down to earth in daylight, though no details are given in this story. According to the county sheriff, checks by ground and air search parties failed to turn up any sign of the various UFO's that had been sighted....

Dear Sirs:
In this letter, we will tell you our beliefs about the Unidentified Flying Objects. We believe that the saucer sightings are 90% true! A flying object of unknown nature landed in Angeles National Forest on Friday, October 19,1962. The following day, there was an article in the "Citizen-NEWS" telling of the landing of this object. We believe that that object contained alien beings from another planet outside of our own solar system; perhaps outside of our galaxy! The U.F.O.'s seen prior to this date, we believe, contained instruments which sent back data about our planet to the world where these beings come from, but the first one mentioned above, we believe, contained foreign beings from another world.

Ever since that occurrence, there have been many unexplained freakish phenomena. Drawings:
1. The crash of the United Air Lines Viscount over St.Louis,Mo. theorize that this plane crashed because the U.F.O. turned on an invisible ray, which had axsuper power, far ahead of our time, that knocked out an eagle's perception of wrong and fighting with this ray.
2.Stipes falling on a house in Angeles National Forest a week prior to the landing of the U.F.O. being weresin a U.F.O. flying over this house at BIG BEAR LAKE and mysteriously dropped rock's. Can to continue studies

My associates and I are in need of more information. I would be appreciated if you would send us all the material known, such as photos, statements, and charts concerning "Flying Saucers" or Unidentified Flying Objects.

Sincerely Yours,

Maneuvering Star In Calif.

At 10 p.m. and thereafter on the evening of 24 October 1962, Mrs. Harlan Driscoll of El Cajon, Calif. and her daughter, Myma, observed a bright star-like object in the northeast at about a 45 degree elevation. To the naked eye the object appeared about the apparent size of Venus, but through binoculars it appeared as several dots of light arranged in a horizontal row, each of which appeared to give off "rays" of light. The observers trained the binoculars on several stars in the sky, but did not observe the same "ray" phenomena.

As was evident on the unknown object, the object made several changes of location, each time traveling at speeds higher than those of military planes commonly observed in the area, after which the object hovered motionless for some time before changing location again. According to V. E. Dewey, APRO member who interviewed the observers, there did not seem to be much change in altitude, and only 10 degrees or so in change in location toward the east during the maneuvers. The intensity of the object's light varied somewhat during the maneuvers but did not appear to be correlated with its motions. Observations were terminated by the observers' need to sleep, and the object therefore was not seen to leave or disappear.

LOCAL SIGHTINGS: Oct 24, 8:10-8:15 PM.
State Rte 43-34 mi N of Kent. Bill Potvin
Jr., a KSU was driving S on Rte 43, when
the object in the form of two red lights
was first sighted to his left about 3/4
miles S of Streetsboro. They were less
than 5° above the horizon. A minute later
he noticed at least two more red lights
one red light revolving. The object looked
to be about the size of a DC-7, and was
veiling at about 75 mph, going N. Potvin
pulled off the road 34 mile N of Kent. The
object then passed over about 500' high
and about 100 yds laterally from the observer. He could now see 5 red lights.
One white light at rear, and no green
light. He could make out no definite
shape, but he felt the craft might be a
blimp. He heard sounds like those of droning engines. The speed was constant at
between 50-75 mph. No gondola or gondola
lights were seen. Potvin tried pursuing
the object N. The object passed over the
intersection of Rtes 43 & 14, and seemed
to be going N on Rte 14. The object was
estimated to be 150' long and 70' wide.
Goodyear Aircraft was checked - but the
blimp has been in Detroit from Oct 16-23.
On the 23rd, it left for Georgia. No blimp
is area. The object's shape and
size as estimated by the observer - - - 
Partly cloudy sky.

MINOR SIGHTINGS: Oct 24, 8:30-9:00 PM DST
Looking toward Kent, 4 red lights - a considerable distance apart- were seen. They
were stationary for a few minutes and then
moved slowly. On
October 24, 10:55-11:08 PM DST - - A large
(3x dinner) yellowish light moving very
slowly at first in a seen. Its elev
was 15-20°. It moved in a circular manner
then E than to SSE. When it was directly
N of the observers it was at 35°-40 elev.
Although the altitude was about 5-7,000',
no sound was heard. The lighting was not
quite conventional. It continued to appear, smoothly to a very high jet-plane
speed, being to time it was climbing
constantly. No trail - two observers....

Variety Of Objects
In Colorado

"Flat, glowing objects" described as
being quite close together and moving
very slowly, were seen at 7:15 a.m. on
26 October 1962, in the southern part
the San Luis Valley in Colorado, by
Alvie Frank, residing 11 miles south of
Monte Vista reported the objects which
were seen just as the sun was rising.

On the same morning, at 7:16 a.m.,
Mrs. Bessie Rogers of Fort Collins spotted a large black parachute-shaped object weaving back and forth over the mountains somewhere between the south
Horseshoe Reservoir and Masonville. She said it flew around for about
10 minutes and then disappeared and returned. At 7:44 a.m., she called the police to report it and the police and sheriff's officers searched the area but found nothing.

On the 29th, Mrs. Vera Rogers reported sighting a round, shiny object which
was flying low over Fort Collins. The
object, heading south, made a soft, whirring sound followed by a "popping"
noise.

Further reports indicated a glowing low-flying object was seen in the sky
late on the nights of the 26th and 27th,
over or near Fort Collins, but no details
were given in newspaper articles.

Following are some of the sightings
which included scanty details:

At 12:20 p.m. on 24 October, two
"parachutes" were seen descending on
the north side of Grand Mesa, in the
vicinity of Cedaredge, Western Colorado. Mrs. Rex Allen of Cedaredge said she
saw two unidentified objects coming down on
the northwest corner of the mesa. A
Fish and Game department plane
searched the area but found nothing.
The FAA said it had no reports of missing aircraft.

Three hours later, at 3:20, an object
was seen descending in the same general area by Mrs. Sydney Shoup and
Mr. and Mrs. Gib Williams of Eckert,
Colorado. None of the witnesses were

Colorado...
(Continued from page 1)

sure of what they saw—but Mrs. Shoup
said the parachute-like object came from
an airplane. No one was able to identify
the aircraft as to type, etc. Mrs. Shoup
said the object appeared to be disc-shaped.

Lester Sandler, an employee of the
Colorado and Southern Railroad at Fort
Collins, reported on the 24th that he
had seen a round, gray-white object at
about noon. He said it appeared to fall
to the ground west of the city. Sheriff
Ray Schaefer went out to investigate and shortly another report came
in to the office pertaining to an object
which appeared to land at the base of
Dixon Canyon Dam on the Poudre River. However, the caller said the object was orange and huge in size, conflicting with the description given by
Sandler. Airplanes sent up to search
found nothing.

For two hours and 17 minutes on the
night of Thursday, 25 October, the Colorado State Patrol dispatcher at Delta, a
state patrolman, the Cedaredge city marshal and a number of other persons,
watched two objects cavorting in the
sky. The dispatcher, Mrs. Helen Mitchell
and Mrs. Mildred Kline, Cedaredge,
and watched them for about a half an
hour. She said the objects were like a fluorescent light, then turning a deep red, dimming and going white
again. They appeared to be stationary
in the sky between Delta and Cedaredge
for a time before they began to ascend.

Cedaredge Marahal Ed Marsh and State
Patrolman Richard Kuta observed the
same objects through binoculars for
some time, and reported that the objects were, at various times, blue-white
and orange in color and shaped like inverted umbrellas with a number of
bright, tail-like appendages. They disappeared from view at Delta about 7:50
p.m. and reappeared over Glenwood
Springs about 8:05 p.m. At 8:15 they
were back over the Grand Mesa area.

Joe McDonald, civil defense coordinator at Delta, Colorado, said he had received several calls from area residents
asking to unidentified or strange
sky objects, etc. Mitchell estimated altitude of the objects at about 1,500 feet, but others felt they were probably at around 5,000
feet altitude. She said the objects were
at least twice the size of the brightest
astronomical objects—stars. They disappeared from view at about 9:32 p.m.
traveling in a southeasterly direction.

Thus ends the summation of information pertaining to the 1962 "flap" for
Colorado. We hope to feature an article
dealing with the high incidence of sightings of UAO in the vicinity of water bodies in the near future, and the above
mentioned sightings strengthens our
theory that water is of more than a passing interest to the UAO.

General Curtis E. Le May
Chief of Staff, The Air Force
The Pentagon
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

Recently, while reading the enclosed newspaper item, I was once again reminded of the somewhat similar sight I viewed in late 1952.

At the time I was in Rapid City, South Dakota, working as a switchman for the Chicago & North Western Railroad.

Our crew had gone on duty at 12 M., and would be relieved at midnight. At the time of going to work the day was sergeant leaning me to believe that it might rain before we went off duty. I was actually on the train I learned that at matter how overcast the sky, it allows actually named Rapid City.

I was standing on the locomotive engine, and noticed that it was 11:45 P.M., then glanced up at the overcast perhaps some 500-feet above the ground. I was likely to remain on duty.

As I advanced up, I was startled to see an inverted "V" winged aircraft come out of the overcast to my right, at an altitude of perhaps 3 or 500 feet. It was flying at an even keel, perfectly no sellers.

The surrounding still, were the phosphorescent-like, glowing lights at the trailing edges of the wings. These lights were arranged in the following manner:

The supposed craft passed distinctly overhead, remained in sight for, approximately 300-feet, before disappearing from view, into the overcast. It was noted in what I took to be a straight line North-Northeast.

Personally, General, I am finally convinced that these objects, both those I viewed and those viewed by the persons mentioned in the newspaper item, were the same, and we composed of radioactive elements created by the afore mentioned atomic (Alamogordo) area. Hence, were and are complete.

I would so see it. I would gladly travel, at my own expense, anywhere, up to discuss or to investigate, for the purpose of discussing this matter and to answer any questions that might wish to be asked.

Very Truly Yours,

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

The Offices of the Chief of Staff has asked this office to reply to your letter concerning flying objects over South Dakota.

Since no date was given for the sighting of 1952, it therefore cannot be connected with any known sightings. Also, in view of the length of time since the sighting, no investigation is deemed necessary.

Regarding the Colorado sightings, our files do not have any cases from Colorado for the week of October 26, 1962. Also, it is noted that the newspaper article indicates the objects were sighted for two hours, yet moved speedily eastward.

I trust the inclosures will give you a better understanding of this phenomenon.

Sincerely,

'Strange' Flying Objects
Seen Over W. Colorado

CEDARIDGE, Colo. Oct. 25 (AP)—Strange objects
in the clear night sky over western Colorado were
sighted last night by some of a ranchers of Cedaredge and Delta.

At least two citizens, showing red, blue, green
and yellow hues, described the objects as hovering
more than 3 hours.

Town marshal Ed Maran state patrolman
Richard Ruts of Delta, and Cedaridge City councilman Phil Auxt and George Bowness watched the
mysterious objects for more than an hour, some
times through binoculars.

Maran said atmospheric conditions might have
produced an illusion, despite the clear, motionless
night.

They were about the size of golf balls, but 14
was impossible to relate them to any known object
with which they were familiar. Maran said the
Maran said the objects changed color rapidly
and appeared phosphorescent. One viewer identified them as resembling ad open airborne. he said.

Earlier this week, two Larimer County residents
in northern Colorado reported seeing an object
as large as 30 to 40 pounds in daylight. A Fort Collins man described the object as moving 200 to 300 pounds.
