1. DATE: 16 May 61
2. LOCATION: Tyndall AFB, Florida

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 2350
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes ☒ No
6. SOURCE: Military

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 hr 30 min - 1 hr 10 min
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

9. COURSE: (Not clearly filled in)

11. COMMENTS: Specification of Venus coincidence with that reported for Obj. Venus at this time was just below horizon and rising. Its magnitude was -4. It is quite possible that strong inversion was throughout Tyndall area and this would have caused dipping to be even more spectacular and could account for radar images. Description and positions are those which were associated with previous experience of viewing planets or stars under conditions of atmospheric refraction.

MISSION REPORT

[Most of the form fields are difficult to read or illegible]

RESUME:

Coody 79 was scrambled in an attempt to intercept an unidentified flying object which was seen on the radar scope in the Tyndall AFB area. The object was unscrambled on the object earlier; however, it was believed that a short range of identifying the object.

Coody 79 was less than five miles from the lead when Huey-37 reported they were losing contact with the object. Coody 79 returned to Tyndall at 1625.

[Note: The bottom of the page contains a form number: AF Form 354 (TARS) Nov 56]

The image appears to be a blank or nearly blank white page with very minimal text. In the bottom right corner, there is a small marking that appears to read "PD", though it is somewhat faint and difficult to discern with complete certainty.

1. Size of object? The size was about as big as the fingernail of your little hand at arm's length.

2. Color? The color was white with white tint to it.

3. Outline of object? The object is round with rough edges. Diagram: [A small cloud-like sketch]

4. How did it disappear? It disappeared by fading slowly than just disappearing.

The text on this page is quite faint and partially illegible. I can make out some words and partial sentences, but not the entire document clearly. Here's what I can discern:

[First line appears to start with "Hence" but is mostly illegible]

[Subsequent lines are fragmentary and difficult to read with certainty]

Some words I can partially make out include:
- "flight"
- "time"
- "light"
- "some"

The majority of the text is too faint or blurry to confidently transcribe without risking introducing errors. The document appears to be a handwritten report with significant degradation of the image quality.

JULY-AUGUST, 1961

Strange Flying Object
Over Base, Tyndall AFB
Tells HQ

For 30 minutes, in the early hours of May 20, 1961, Tyndall Air Force Base was under observation by a strange, unidentified flying object which maneuvered over the base.

During this time, the UFO was tracked by two Air Force radars, was reported by a number of the 4750th Air Police Squadron personnel and an Air Force NORAD officer.

After attempted interception, the object climbed away from the base and disappeared.

At base level, AF has kept the UFO surveillance from the public, but NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) was given a complete report.

A condensed time and date of sighting: 0200 hours (2:00 a.m.) 20 May 1961.

Report from Post HQ, by Airman Carlton L. Heiden, Air Police, Air Defense Command.

At about 0250, May 20, 1961, sightseers noticed high altitude, undetermined electronic high-speed, intermittent tracking.

When the UFO was first noticed, it was reportedly from electronic-magnetic interference contact was made with Tyndall Operations.

Radar tracking was made by M/Sgt. Henry J. Lacour, radar operator, and Capt. Allan E. Anderson, at 6500 feet.

A UFO was charted by Project Blue Book (ATIC) Intelligence Center.

In a call to Major Robert Friend of Project Blue Book, the report was discussed.

The complete report: Clearwater-211, excerpts attached.

The UFO report was unavailable, he gave the UFO report to the Officer of the Day.

Air Police received radar data from Capt. J.D. Druse, Launch Crew Chief, unable to observe the light.

Report of Airman Gary L. Kelly, Air Police: Intercepted Post 13 (radar) at approximately 0400 I said he would check.

Noticed a bright shining object, moving to Eglin, Okaloosa Site, coming in over Elgin Site, Air Police: Concurrence by the Ground Observer Corps, first ground observer to witness UFO.

Persons: Cooley 29 (flight code name) was scrambled in an aircraft to intercept. He had not seen earlier in the night near Launch Site. One of the alert flyers had been scrambled in the object's vicinity, however, it was halted due to an inability to identify the object.

British-CFIT reported that they had been unable to trace the object. Cooley returned to Tyndall at 0628.

According to Form 697(STAFF), Maj 23 Visual contact was made by Capt. Yeager of the Operations Group.

The simultaneous visual and radar reports, including both ground and airborne observers, appear to be valid. Pending any possibility of explanation, the fractions of sightings are considered valid.

The complete report will be given a Chairman Oversight Inspection, Astronautics Committee, in the coming weeks.

Origin of start: Base Operations
Type of Mission: Search, Grid Location N/A, A/C Number: N/A
Crew: Capt. Candian, N/A, Helicopter aircraft: 0448c, Sortie 1, Total time: 1:10 min.
Helicopter Crew: Capt. F.P. Cagle
Sightings: Sept. 13, AIC
Memo: Tech.

During the early hours of May 20,1961 for over 90 minutes, a Tyndall Air Force Base was under observation by a strange, round object, glowing orange-white, which maneuvered over the Drone(pilot-less aircraft) Launching Site. The UFO was tracked by two Air Force radar stations. When the UFO was near an observation post their radio temporarily failed, apparently from electro-magnetic interference. When intercepted, apparently by a jet eng a helicopter, the UFO climbed away from the base and disappeared.

The image appears to be a heavily gridded document with very faint and mostly illegible text. At the top of the page, I can partially make out "ATLANTIC COAST" but most of the text is too blurry or faint to read clearly. The document seems to be a form or log sheet with numerous vertical and horizontal grid lines covering most of the page. The bottom of the page shows some numbers (30-791) but the surrounding text is not clearly readable.

The following, extracted from Capt Van John's Report dated 20 May 61, is quoted for your information:

1020 hours, Major Gray, 800th-PAFB (61316), received a UFO sighting report by phone from Tyndall AFB. Since he could not locate Maj Friend, AFCIN-4X2, he asked what now to do (??). In view of the fact Tyndall AFB did not submit a formal report, I asked Maj Gray to send whatever information he had obtained at this time to Maj Friend, AFCIN-4X2.

2. Description of Course of Object:

a. Airman Henson's report - On the morning of May 20, 1961 at approximately 0250 I saw this orange like light that came out of the woods. I first went up and then it backed down to tree level and then went back up and stayed up at the same position for approximately ten minutes. Then it started moving toward me and then it would move back to the same position. It did this twice and then disappeared at 0430.

b. At approximately 0300 hours, 20 May 1961 I heard Airman Henson call in to Tyndall via radio from Post #13 that there was a flying object around his post. Upon arrival, I noticed an unidentified object floating

Here is the OCR text from the document:

around in the air, moving back and forth, sideways and up and down.
When I left the scene at approximately 0330 hours, the object was still
floating around in the air. When I returned at 0500 hours, the object
was no longer in sight.

c. Sgt. Mallett's report - I received a radio call from A/3C Henson,
the guard at Post #13, Drone Launch site, located approximately 3 miles
from Gate #2, Tyndall AFB. Airman Henson stated he could see an
unusual light from his post. Airman Henson stated it was unusual to
him because the light had moved several times. He further stated the
light did not move in the normal course of an aircraft. I then proceeded
to boundary of the base at the east range and parked my AP vehicle to
observe the light. I remained at that area until 0500 hours, 20 May 1961.

floating object. Car #3 said he would check. At about 0400 hours I
noticed a bright shining object about 30° from horizontal and it did not
appear to be moving. On closer observation I noticed it was moving
west slowly. I went to the Drone Launch site to exchange vehicles and
continued to see it.

    Dispatcher, A/2C Varijen called me. He said he had a problem on a
    U. F. O. E. RAPCON was painting a sighting that the Air Police at the
    ground launch site had called in.

    (1) I notified Brush Off Control and they too were painting an
    object 8-12 miles west of PAM. The object was at first reported 2
    miles west of the TACAN, then abruptly shifted to 8-12 miles west.

    (2) I notified MOADS and they in turn scrambled a Hot Fighter
    to run on this object. Fighter was airborne in two minutes. Radar
    was still tracking this object. Pilot didn't see a thing, even though he
    was getting a sporadic paint on his radar.

    (3) Object was at first traveling 2-4 miles an hour, then up to
    45 miles an hour. A helicopter was scrambled due to the slowness of
    it. From all reports, they didn't see a thing.

    (4) At approximately 0510C Radar lost contact. I called the
    Navy Mine Defense Laboratory to see if they had any people on their
    stages that they have two miles and ten miles out in the Bay. Stage
    #1 and 2 out. No sighting. Stage #2 ten miles out. No report as yet.

    (5)contacted the Florida Highway Patrol, Bay County Sheriff,
