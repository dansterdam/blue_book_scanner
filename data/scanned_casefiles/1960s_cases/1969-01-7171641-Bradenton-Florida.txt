PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP : 17/1830
2. LOCATION: Bradenton, Florida
10. CONCLUSION: Other: (UNRELIAELE REPORT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: CONTENTS: It would seem very strange if a 15 yr old boy could watch several disc shaped objects as a pair attempt to reproduce to the ground. It would also seem strange if an object were as low as he reported, in a residential area, and be reported by only one observer.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
ALL ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS OF THE OBSERVATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SIGHTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

The objects were seen at 11:30 pm, moving from South to North. 
The main object ejected two smaller objects which circled the bigger object twice. One of the smaller objects came very close to the ground ahead of me, remained there for a few minutes, then went back up to rejoin its companion. After that, the two small objects disappeared inside the big object, and then the big object shot straight up at a 90 degree angle and disappeared. The sighting lasted about 20 minutes, and the big object, before ejecting the smaller objects, hovered very low over the ground.

January 17, 1969

Dear Gentlemen:

I would like to report a sighting to you that occurred on the night of January 17, 1969 at 11:30 p.m. as I was sitting in front of my house observing this constant 3223 when from the south came a bright ball that appeared to be about 2/3 the size of a football field and was traveling at an extremely fast rate of speed. It passed over my house at about a 60 degree angle, brightly illuminating the surrounding area and moving towards the northwest at the same speed. When it reached a point about a half block down the street from my house it suddenly stopped and hovered in the same spot for about 2 minutes. 

The object was oval in shape and appeared to be revolving slowly. It was a color that I would describe as somewhere between white and silver. After remaining motionless for about 2 minutes, the object began moving again, this time at a much slower rate of speed, and headed back in the direction from which it had come. As it approached the initial point where I had first spotted it, the object suddenly flashed brightly and then disappeared. The total sighting lasted for about 3 minutes.

About half a block down the street from my house are some woods and a clearing. There are no houses in this area, and the object hovered over the clearing. From its position, it seemed to be about 100 yards from my house. It appeared to be about the size of a football field and from my estimate was approximately 75 feet off the ground. While the object was hovering, it looked like it was pulsating and giving off a sort of mist or fog. 

I reported this sighting to the Air Force and the local police. After examining the area the following day, they found nothing unusual. I did not see any other aircraft in the area at the time, and there were no sounds associated with the object. This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this, and I am quite sure of what I saw.

I would appreciate it if you could provide me with any information or an explanation of this sighting.

Sincerely,

There are two illustrations in this image. The first is a compass rose diagram that instructs the viewer to "NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE A '+' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO FIRST SEEN." 

The second illustration shows two sketches. The larger one depicts a person standing in a landscape with various objects and shapes in the sky. The smaller one shows a person standing in a landscape with a curved horizon line.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a detailed drawing or illustration showing a series of arrangements of celestial objects, likely to depict a UFO sighting. The drawing shows multiple small shapes arranged in different configurations.

The text in the document reads as follows:

IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?
There were 2 (phenomena)

CONDITIONS (CHECK APPROPRIATE BLOCKS)
SKY: OVERCAST, PARTLY CLOUDY, CLEAR, TWILIGHT, NIGHT
WEATHER: CUMULUS CLOUDS (FLUFFY), CIRROSTRATUS CLOUDS (HIGH HAZY), FOG OR MIST, HEAVY RAIN, LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE, HAIL, SNOW OR SLEET, UNKNOWN, NONE OF THE ABOVE
IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, MOON: BRIGHT MOONLIGHT, MOON WITH HALO, MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS, PARTIAL OBSCURATION, NO MOONLIGHT, UNKNOWN

DURATION: (IN BACK OF YOU) / (TO YOUR LEFT) / (TO YOUR RIGHT) / (OVERHEAD) (NEAR MOON)
IN BACK OF YOU: STEADY SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS STREETLIGHT, HEADLIGHTS OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT REMAINED STEADY OR MOVED, OTHER DETAILS SUCH AS SHAPE, SIZE, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT, MANNER OF DEPARTURE, AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU OBSERVED.
The phenomenon appeared to give off its own light. Throughout the entire occurrence I only noticed two colors, white and red. The objects seemed very solid and the edges were sharp. The phenomenon was a circular shape and the objects were various sizes. The only object I can compare it to would be a street lamp about half a block away from me. The smaller objects circled the bigger object. Then most of them came down and hovered over what looked like a small building. They projected a beam of light to the ground, and the beam went into the building. After that I could see them go straight up.

The image contains a diagram depicting a sphere with some labeled axes. The text below the diagram states "No noticeable protrusions or vapor trails".

Text extracted from the document:
12. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROJECTIONS. AND INDICATE ROUGHLY THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
Sphere
Axes
No noticeable protrusions or vapor trails 
WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, BUILDING, TREE ETC.? THIS WILL INDICATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE SKY, OR NEAR OBJECT, THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED.
I am not able to guess that exactly, but I would guess that about 1/3 of the sky height the object would have been covered by the watch head.
