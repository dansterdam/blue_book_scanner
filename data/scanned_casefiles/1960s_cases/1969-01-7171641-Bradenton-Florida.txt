COMMENTS: It would seem very strange if a 15 yr old boy could watch several disc shaped objects as an area so reported for a period of 20 minutes and not make any attempt to get witnesses to the event. It would also seem strange if an object were as low as he reported, in a residential area, and be reported by only one observer.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

The objects were seen at 11:30 pm, moving from South to North. The main object ejected two smaller objects which circled the bigger object twice. One of the smaller objects came very close to the ground ahead of me, remained there for a few minutes, then went back up to rejoin its companion. After doing this the two small objects went inside the big object and then the big object shot straight up at a 90 angle and disappeared. The sighting lasted about 20 minutes, and the big object, before ejecting the smaller objects, turned red.

January 19, 1969

Dear Gentlemen:

I would like to report a sighting to you that occurred on the night of January 17, 1969 at 11:30. I was outside in front of my house observing the constellation icons when from the south came a bright ball that appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arms length and about as bright as a car headlight seen from two blocks away. When I first spotted this object it was at a 60 degree elevation from the horizon and moving towards the north at the same speed as an airplane seen at night.

It was moving towards the north when all of a sudden it stopped and hovered in the east. After remaining stationary for about a minute it turned an orange-red in color and a noted two oval objects behind the other, in succession from the objects right side, after doing this the object turned back to its original color, while and continuing to remain stationary. After the two oval objects were ejected they too remained motionless for a few seconds and then began circling the bigger object. After circling the bigger object twice the two smaller objects came back to their original position. One thing I failed to mention earlier was that the two small oval objects were about one-fifth the size of their bigger companion. After remaining in their original position for a few seconds one of the small oval objects began to increase in size, then I finally realized it was moving towards me.

About half a block down the street from my house are some woods, and this object hovered from 50-100 ft. At this time woods all it took the object from five to ten minutes to move from its position above the woods. Now the object has increased the size of a football held at arms length and was bright enough to illuminate the area with a soft white glow. While the object was hovering here a faint humming sound, like some swarm of bees make. After hovering over the woods for at least five minutes it went back to rejoin the two smaller companion which seemed to be waiting for this other to return. After regaining its original position in the sky the two small objects went into the bigger object. For a few more seconds it shot straight up and disappeared into the night sky.

While this incident was going on did neither of the three objects blink or flicker. The condition of the sky was cloudless and clear and I didn't notice in the sky was a moon or not. There were no other objects in the sky at the time, and the entire incident lasted from fifteen to twenty minutes. I have no apparent or usual flight characteristics made by the objects or

The document also contains two hand-drawn diagrams:
- The top diagram shows a compass-like orientation with N, E, O, S marked
- The bottom diagram shows a detailed trajectory of an object with numbered steps (1-6), including descriptions like "last seen, went straight up", "circled object", "went up", "came down", with notes about size ("size of football at arms length") and height ("50+ 100 ft woods")

Dear Gentlemen:

Please excuse my delay in returning your questionnaire. If you come up with any ideas as to what I saw please let me know as soon as possible. I am quite puzzled as to what I saw, and I would like to find out once and for all what it is that I really observed.

Sincerely,

P.S. If you need any more information than that which is enclosed please let me know. Thanks you very much for the literature you gave me, it is coming in very handy.

E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREET LAMP, ETC. FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY DISTANCE TO LIGHT SOURCE.
the major source of illumination was a street lamp which was about half a block away.

12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT SEEMED SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER IT WAS IN MOTION, APPEARED TO CHANGE SHAPE, WHETHER IT APPEARED AS A POINT OR LIGHT, INDICATE COMPARISON WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

The phenomenon appeared to give off its own light. Through but the entire occurrence I only noticed two colors, white and red.
The objects seemed very solid and the edges were sharp. The main object was round and the two small objects were ovals.
The only object I can compare it with that was in my field of view would be a street lamp about half a block away from my house. It made a slight noise, like that of a swarm of bees.
The smaller objects circled the bigger object twice. Then one of them came down and hovered over some woods. After doing that it went back up. I stayed in its comparison, and the better of them went into the bigger object which took off straight up.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW IF YOU HAD BEEN AT THE POINT OF SIGHTING, ESTIMATE THE TIME OF SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

I am not very good in judging size, but I would guess that about 1/3 of the object would have been covered by the match head.

A baseball is the only object that can compare with the one I saw, except that the object that I saw glowed and I didn't notice any stitches that a baseball has.
