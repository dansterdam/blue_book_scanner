k. See comments of preparing individual below

Mr. [redacted] is a man of some means and seems to be a reliable source of information. Mr. [redacted] in person to Lt Col D.G. Thompson, Director of Administrative services who had the report typed up and sent to us. After talking with Col Thompson who said that the man appeared normal when he gave him the report we decided it was not necessary to contact Mr. [redacted] personally.

It is my opinion after a preliminary analysis that the objects sighted were a combination of weather balloons and the moonrising. This explains the apparent rise and fall of the objects sighted.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER

I concur with the preliminary report and agree that the objects sighted was probably a combination of the moon rising and weather balloons.
