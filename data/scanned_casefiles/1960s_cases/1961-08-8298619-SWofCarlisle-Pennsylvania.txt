Carlisle, Pennsylvania                                                                August 10, 1961

Mr. [redacted]
Chief Inspector
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

Our company possesses a guest house on a mountain top Southwest of Carlisle.

A number of us were holding a meeting Tuesday Evening, August 8. It was warm and we were sitting on an uncovered veranda.

At two minutes of ten we noted a bright light overhead longitudinally but a few degrees Northwest latitudinally. It moved in an East by North direction. At five minutes after ten it disappeared behind the tree tops.

The sight was clear, stars were plainly visible. The North star provided a sense of direction. The light was brighter than any star.

As we followed the course of the light it seemed to move a bit erratically from side to side and on a few occasions seemed to jump ahead. Though all of us observed these variables momentarily, I recognize they could be attributed to atmospheric conditions or eye concentration.

I have been at a loss as to whether to report this and, if so, to whom.

I would like to assure you that the light observed was not an airplane. With the sky so full of "exotic objects" one hesitates to report any observation today.

Sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]
