10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    Bright light in sky observed 010°from, and close to, the star Capella. Light same size, intensity and appearance as Capella. Appeared stationary for about 5 min, after which it began to move erratically on a steady course of about 035°. Movement was steady. It traversed from a position 318°, position angle 45°15'min, to a position 0h7°, position angle about 300°, in a period of 10 min. Then lost in view due to sunrise.

11. COMMENTS
    Satellite ruled out-Object was apparently stationary for first 5 min of sighting, too slow for natural satellite. Moved in wrong direction for star or planet. This report was not received until almost 2 months after the sighting was made. The only point on which the witness was located was in a group of ships. There were no other reports made of anything unusual being seen. Therefore, since there was only one witness, this report is evaluated as insufficient data.
