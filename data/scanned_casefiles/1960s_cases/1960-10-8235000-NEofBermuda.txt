The object had the appearance of a metallic or silvery airborn object, sometimes pulsating, which moved randomly and erratically through the sky at speeds estimated to be between 200-300 knots. It was observed by several observers and appeared as an ellipse or disc when viewed directly. The object remained in view for a period of 10 min.

INFORMATION REPORT
OFFICE OF PROVOST MARSHAL GENERAL
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY
WASHINGTON 25, D.C. 
3 October 1960

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unknown Objects
TO: Chief, ATIC
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

1. The following is a report of the sighting of unknown objects near Bermuda on 8 October 1960:

The objects were first observed at approximately 2140 hours local time on 8 October 1960, approximately 100 miles northeast of Bermuda. The objects were observed by the pilot and copilot of a commercial air carrier flight and were also picked up on the aircraft's radar.

The pilot described the objects as round, very bright, and moving at a high rate of speed. The objects appeared to maneuver in a manner inconsistent with known aircraft. The objects were observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing from sight and from the aircraft's radar.

Attempts were made to contact the objects by radio, but there was no response. No other aircraft were operating in the area at the time.

2. The pilot and copilot were interviewed and confirmed the above details. The incident was also reported to the FAA and NORAD.
