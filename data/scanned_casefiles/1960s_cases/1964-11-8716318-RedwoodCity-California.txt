1. The enclosed UFO sighting was reported to the Mill Valley Radar Site (ADC) as the enclosed letter indicates. However, by the time the information reached this office, it was too late for an on-the-spot investigation.

2. This same phenomenon was seen by several other persons. Since their reports coincide with the enclosed information, statements were not obtained.

3. The person who supplied the report and the color slide is a professional photographer.

4. Probable identity of this object has not been determined. As far as can be determined, there were no weather balloons or missiles in the area at the time of the sighting.

- page 6 -

The duration of this sighting was about 10 minutes or a little less.
The camera used was a Kodak M-3
The lens was a Tamron 50 millimeter focal length f/2 summicron lens. Shutter speeds were varied between 1/30 to 1/125th second, all exposures were at f/16. The film was Agfachrome CT-18. The film is being processed now and I will send you the transparencies when I receive them from the laboratory.

Date the following qualifications. I have been in military astronomy since 1950 and have made my own refractor of 6-inch telescopes.
I was in the ground observer corps, for several years and I am also a professional photographer.
I have also observed weather balloons, mirages, planets, aircraft at night, helicopters at night, meteors, aurora borealis, and other unidentified sky phenomena but this was not like any of those things I have mentioned.

I would like to know if you would send back the identity of this puzzle if you solve it. You will file cold data as soon as likely are turned to me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted name]
Redwood City

Lieutenant W. Hyman,

In reply to your letter on the 5th, here are some details. The sighting was made on Monday, November 2 - 18:20 to 18:40 hours on G.A. Office observation line. I was on B express Freeway and the light was toward skyline.

I first noticed it. The whirligig start turning in Redwood City. The object appeared to be 10° west of light, north. The object seemed to be west of the Crow's nest of hills. The object appeared to be composed of several lights connected together and rotating in a counter clockwise direction. The object kept constant speed of about 20-40 miles per hour - it was slightly faster than the traffic on B express but slower than any aircraft. I was near. The lights did not blink but were a steady white light which slowly went to pale orange back to white, to orange to white. The class, at times the single light appeared to merge to grow or an unknown ground light similar to the round fluorescent tubes found in some homes sometimes used in lighting a kitchen. Something like this. It might be described as a ring of light. I then would watch back to individual lights again like then .... the station was about way on the road and was constant.

I stopped the car and got out twice and it appeared no different. The path of the object was - roughly - parallel to the road. Possibly a little toward the south.

I point roughly a road west off of B express for I had to go to work.

Major Walls,

In answer to your call, here is a description as I remember it.

Going back to work at 6:30, I turned onto Bayshore Freeway from the Whipple Street overpass. Redwood City and proceeded north. A bright light in the west caught my eye and I looked all over a bright object going north all of a sudden I was pulled to my line of travel at the Coyote River bridge more to the ocean.

Angle was about 20-30 degrees and a steady altitude. It was a little faster than a jet on Bayshore. The color of the light(s) went from white to range to white etc. The lights were rotating, counterclockwise. Also, the object appeared to change from "oval" to "matte" lights to many into a "ring of light" then go back to single lights again and go on. Distance was 5 minutes for I had to turn off Bayshore at 5 minutes after I was to go to work. I stopped. I can turn and go out just to be sure I was actually seeing something.

Color slides were taken. Only one (1) is good enough to go data processing. There was information on that picture. Film was C-118. Exposure 1/25 sec at f/2.8. The camera is a 6.9 cm f/1.3. The lens is a 90 millimeter focal length 1/2 summicron (Summicron)

As to my background, I am a professional photographer. I was in the ground observer corps and I am an astronomer. Thus I have experience in observing sky phenomena such as weather balloons, meteors, aircraft at night, bright points, auroras, sunsets, bright points, visual inversions and so on.

The color slide is being sent in a separate package to make sure it will not be damaged in the mail.

Sincerely, yours

UFO Report

1. I tried to call you several times today but was unable to make contact.

2. So that the Air Force can better evaluate your report of sighting an UFO 14 till he necessary to forward the following information to Base Operations at Hamilton AFB, California.

a. Place, time and date of sighting.

b. Approximately how long the object was in sight.

c. Since a camera was used it will be necessary for Base Operations to make duplicates of the negatives. They would appreciate it if you would send then the film developed or not, and also the following information:

(1) Type camera used
(2) Type and make of lens
(3) Focal length of lens
(4) Shutter speed
(5) F-stop
(6) Brand and type of film

3. Any future reportings should be made directly to Base Operations at Hamilton. They are better equipped and can handle sightings much faster.

22 January 1965

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your observation of an unidentified flying object on the night of 2 November 1964 and the photograph taken of this object.

The analysis and microscopic study of the 35mm film has been completed. The area of interest was enlarged to a power of 20 and is attached for your use.

The conclusions of the study after photo analysis are as follows: (1) No true photographic image is visible on the clip. (2) The visible image could be a film flaw or a duplicate. (3) The constant density from film edge to camera indicates that the film was not exposed in a camera but in the open. Also, it appears that the photograph was taken after dark within the time of the sighting was reported as dusk. This could indicate that the film could have been accidentally exposed without your knowledge.

From the data presented in your report we are unable to make a positive identification of the object you observed. The size of the object was indicated as the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length. This indicates an object of tremendous size since the size of the moon is less than a dime held at arm's length. Your description and time motion sequence were not included. There were two particular temperature inversions in the area, one at 430 feet and the other at 550 feet. The position of the object was given as 20 degrees elevation, 330 degrees azimuth. Disappearance azimuth was reported. No major astronomical object appeared in this location.

Major Walls,

Sorry to take so long but things just kept piling up. Anyway, the slide is enclosed herewith. Two pieces of black cardboard. When you open, the slide will look like letter ↑

[A small hand-drawn diagram/sketch is present in the middle of the page]

+ the frames from (w) contains are for visual identification of the object just connect the two cardboard and it will be in the position. I would like to have this positive. It is step for projection from a slide projector. If there are any questions, let me know and I will answer if I can.

The following information is requested for analysis of the visual observation: (1) A local map of the area and the location (direction of object from the observer's location) including azimuth and location of the object observed. (2) A time motion sequence of the object's flight in relation to the motion of your car and the direction and flight path of the object after the car was stopped. (3) Or particular interest is the manner of disappearance of the object. (4) Any information pertaining to the description of the object in changes, size, or intensity are also desired.

We regret the delay in asking for this information and hope that the data requested may not have been forgotten with the passage of time.

UFO Sighting and Photo, Redwood City, California, 2 Nov 64     5 Jan 65

Hq USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs Hunt)
Wash D C  20330

This office is in receipt of a UFO report from _______ of
Redwood City, California. The following is a suggested reply.

Dear Mr. _______

This is in reply to your observation of an unidentified flying
object on the night of 2 November 1964 and the photograph taken of
this object.

The analysis and microscopic study of the 35mm film has been
completed. The area of interest was enlarged to a power of twenty
and is attached for your use.

The conclusions of the study after photo analysis are as follows:
(1) No true photographic image in visible on the chip, (2) The
visible image could be a film flavor or a duplicated film or chip in
the emulsion, (3) The content density from film edge to film edge
could indicate that the film was not exposed in a camera, but rather
had exposed in the open. Also, it appears that the photograph was
taken after dark, while the time of the sighting was reported as
dusk. This would tend to indicate that the film could quite likely
have been exposed without your knowledge.

From the data presented in your report we are unable to make a
positive identification of the object which you observed. The size
of the object was indicated as the size of a fifty cent piece held
at arms length. The size of the moon is less than a dime at arms
length. This indicates an object of tremendous size while the remainder of the description indicates a much smaller object. The duration
and time motion sequence was not included. There were two particular
temperature inversions in the area, one at 480 ft and the other at


- page 17 -

550 ft. The position of the object was given as 20 degrees elevation, 330 degrees azimuth, disappearance was listed on the same heading but no elevation or azimuth was reported. No major astronomical object appeared in this location.

We had hoped that the photograph would reveal an identifiable image. However, photo analysis revealed that the image on the print is not the same as the object observed by you.

The following information is desirable for analysis of the visual observation: (1) A local map of the area and the location (direction of object from the observer's location) including azimuth and location of the object observed, (2) A time motion sequence of the object's flight in relation to the motion of your car and the direction and flight path of the object after the car was stopped, (3) Of particular interest is the manner of disappearance of the object, (4) Any information pertaining to the description of the object in change, in size, or intensity are also desired.

We regret the delay in asking for this information and hope that some of the data requested may not have been forgotten with the passage of time. We had expected the photograph to reveal the true nature of the image.

The Air Force wishes to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in unidentified flying objects and reported observations.

1. PURPOSE: This report answers work order #64-120 submitted by Major
H. Quintanilla, TDBW. The request forwarded a photo and color slide of
a purported unidentified flying object.

2. ANALYSIS: Microscopic study of the attached 35MM slide by the photo
analysis and photo processing personnel resulted in the following con-
clusions:

    a. No true photographic image is visible on the chip.

    b. The visible image could be film flaw or a duplicated flaw or
    chip in the emulsion.

    c. The constant density from film edge to film edge could indicate
    that the film was not exposed in a camera, but rather had been exposed
    in the open.
