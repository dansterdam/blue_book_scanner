UFO Sighting, Meridian, Idaho

Hq USAF SAFCICC (Mrs Hunt)

The 26 October 1965 Meridian, Idaho sighting is carried in Air Force files as "unidentified." The sighting has the normal characteristics of a helicopter observation. We have checked the FAA, military, and civilian helicopter units which might operate in the Meridian area and have not been able to find an operational helicopter during this date and time. The following description was furnished by the witness:

a. Object was circular from directly below and football shaped when viewed from the side.

b. Object emitted a "deep, pulsating, loud, extremely irritating sound."

c. Object hovered four and one half minutes over observers, gained altitude (amount not estimated), flew South for one minute, changed heading to Southwest, flew Southwest for one half minute, and disappeared behind houses and trees.

Total time of observation was six minutes. Observer did not estimate size or speed of object in his official report to the Air Force. Information was received through normal teletype channels; therefore, FTD Form 164 was not used in this case.

TO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCES MISC, VOL II, NO 1, MAR 64

24 OCT 63
MERIDIAN, IDAHO

CASE SIGHTING IN IDAHO: At least four people in Meridian, Idaho, included Mr. [redacted] and her two sons, one of whom made the following report:

"My brother [redacted] heard a noise over the house at 8:45 p.m. It faded away, but then came closer again and hovered over the house. My mother, Russell, and I looked outside. It was dark out, but as nearly as we could see, the object was perfectly round and about 35 feet in diameter. A red light on its side flashed on and then went off quickly. It made a very deep humming noise. It just hung about 5 feet above our willow tree, very low and pretty scared."

The family, as well as the F.A.A., discounted the possibility that the craft could have been a helicopter.
