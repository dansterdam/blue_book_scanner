Dear Project Blue Book:

I recently wrote to you for Information on Unidentified Flying Objects. Don't get me wrong I got the information but enclosed in one of your books-let's was the thing, that people whom they see such things, fill out and send back. I wasn't sure it was official but I filled it out and returned it.

But I received no more information besides the fact there is much more to the story. You already know I spotted a flying saucer but that isn't all. I was so sure it was a comet, meteor, etc. that I (just for fun) I waved at it with my whole arm. Well there must have been some sort of window in it with some one in it looking out, because the minute I started waving it stopped and hovered. Then it continued on it's path. I ran inside and got my camera to photograph it but I was so scared (as I've never seen such a thing) I ran inside, locked the door, and didn't exit until late the next morning.

I really couldn't get a good clear picture of it because of the flashing and pulsating lights. I wasn't even sure it existed but now I am. The other night I was just ready to go to bed when I thought I would retrace my telescope and take a look at the stars. I took a peak through the blinds to see what to focus it on when I saw something. I couldn't even see it but I saw the lights that were attached and the seemed to be attached to something square shaped. I'd say it was airplane lights but they formed a square and it went much too fast. This was the third time I saw such a thing and you ought to do a little more about these things than receive reports.

People like me all over the world are scared stiff. I get the feeling they're following me and believe me it's not funny to be in our shoes. Yes our don't read this and say I'm a nut. WAKE UP, the world may be in a state of danger. One man (Martell) has already been killed it could be that if you don't do something many more could die. Please send me more information. At least can say one thing your organization is trying I'm sure you'll not let this the world end.

Sincerely Yours,
[Signature redacted]

Proposed reply to letter from John Souch, 7 May 1967

Dear

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object. Without an exact date or comment concerning the flight characteristics, a positive identification cannot be made. Your report will be filed for information purposes only.

The Air Force has found no tangible evidence that proves extraterrestrial vehicles exists. After investigating over 11,000 cases since 1947, there has been a total lack of evidence to substantiate the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles flying in and out of our atmosphere.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force
