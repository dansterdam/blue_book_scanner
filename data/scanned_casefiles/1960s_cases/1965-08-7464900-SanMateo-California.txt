Dear Sirs:

In the course of a conversation the other day, a person mentioned the sighting of an unidentified flying object to me. Since I do have a rather large interest in this field, I interviewed the person who was involved in the sighting. I thought you might be interested in his answers to several questions which I put to him.

Question #1 was-What were the conditions under which you saw the object in the sky? The answer was that it was a clear night with a few clouds. "It was about 9:30 P.M. two weeks ago when I first spotted the object in the sky. It seemed to be shining as from the reflected light of the sun. It had a fantastic speed. As it reached the zenith, four pink objects shot out of it, one to each point of the compass. The pink objects were going at a fantastic rate of speed. As the white object continued to descend, it stopped 30° above the horizon."

Question #2 was-Did anything occur when the object stopped? Answer was-"The object changed color from reddish-pink, to green, to yellowish-orange."

Question #3 was-Next what happened? Answer was that the object kept changing colors and then suddenly disappeared.

Question #4 was- Was their any noise or sound that caught your attention? Answer was negative.

RE-EXAMINATION AND ANALYSIS

SUBJECT:   UFO sightings 2-3 August, 1965; Valentino, Nebr.
           reported by Jud Gana Gatzanas in "Report of
           Unidentified Object or Phenomena"

OBJECTIVES: To check all possible data on the scene and
            to fill in data gaps in the original report.
NOTE:      Original report was written in California
           and object positions, etc. were determined by
           memory.

GENERAL RE-EXAMINATION: Object positions were measured at
the scene of the sightings and, for future reference, plotted on the panorama. This was drawn so that, when held at 22w from the eye, the objects in the skyline have the correct apparent size and position, and the objects therefore the correct positions in the sky. In cases where the objects were not viewed from the point from which the drawing was made, corrections have been made for the apparent position change of the objects. (Note: this applies particularly to objects C and B. In the report objects B are said to be moving behind a tree. From the panorama point, they were not.)

As a check, the apparent elevation was of several landmarks was measured from the panorama point. This general re-examination resulted in some corrections of the original data.

CORRECTIONS: (as down on panorama):
Object A:   Minimum elevation, 71°; maximum elevation, 230°; max elevation photographed, 181°; approximately due west.

Objects B:  Minimum elevation, 10°, while rising over house; minimum final elevation, object B1 250°, minimum final elevation, object B3, 30°; distance between objects B, B1 40°; B1, B3 10°. B3 is 10°, B2, 90°. B1, B2 upon rising; final object distances (in same order) 30°, 20°, 10°, 80°, NNW to NE, arcing path.

Object C:   Measuring elevation, 15°, NW, between 10-15 sec, traveling approx. 30°, angular speed, 2 to 3 deg/sec. Similar for object C1. Stabilized for less than 1 sec. Appeared in less than one sec. Fading out while moving over similar indicated path.

Object D:   On panorama, minimum elevation, approx. 80°, maximum elevation, 320°; no photo (see examination of photo B.)


- page 10 -

EXAMINATION OF PHOTO B:
Camera position: By observation, it was obvious that the photo was not of objects a camera possibly. There is no pole in the proper position from anywhere near the observing scene. From the NW corner of 7th and Main the pole would be in the correct position, but the lighting and other differences, thus, the only possible alternative is that the photo was of object A in the West. The Approximate camera position was determined by memory and observation of the apparent positions of the cross wires with respect to the pole. Thus it was determined that it was approximately 134 feet west and between 52'8" and 51'4" south of the pole, elevated on a ladder 5'9" high, with the camera pointing at about a 25° angle. The three test photos (photo 1) were taken from a 52'8" and 52'8" south of the pole. Arcturus was observed to "set" over the pole, as in the UFO photo, at 12:42 A.M. August 3, determining that it indeed was the correct star.

Exposure determination: Trial interrupted exposures of Arcturus were made to determine the length of the UFO exposure. The shutter was open and closed as follows:

OPEN                   CLOSED
30 sec.                30 sec.
30 sec.                30 sec.
30 sec.                30 sec.
60 sec.                30 sec.
30 sec.                5 min.
30 sec.                30 sec.
30 sec.                30 sec.
30 sec.                indeterminate
60 sec.                60 sec.
60 sec.                end.

producing the dotted star trails. By comparison with photo 2, in which the pole is the same size as\photo 1, the exposure length was determined to be at least 2 min 20 sec. and at most 2 min longer on how far behind the pole the star went before the exposure was stopped. The approximate angular velocity of the UFO upward, if the varying light spread is taken as a mean light intensity change, is about 40'/min.

COMMENTS ON THE PHOTO: The fact that no other star trails are visible in this photo is possibly because of increased in background illumination near the horizon, compounded by slower film. The test shots were taken with Tri-X developed in Acufine, a much faster film than the Xk used for the UFO shots. This film was developed and printed by the Lincoln Journal staff, and as yet no information about their processes has been obtained.

GENERAL COMMENTS: It is interesting that all witnesses were quite convinced that the photo B had been taken facing north, a completely impossible act. Even the photographer's records, written immediately after the sighting, give no indication that a photo was taken facing west that includes a star and pole, although one is indicated for the north. This sighting and investigation points up the need for on the spot investigations as soon as possible after the sighting to maintain its memory of a witness. Even though the incident is still vivid in mind, it is most frustrating that I can remember the star-pole photo taken facing north (which was never returned by the newspaper) as if I took it yesterday, but can not, even in the face of this investigation, recall a similar photo taken facing west. Perhaps had investigation been conducted sooner after the sighting this photo puzzle could have been solved, or perhaps it would never have existed.

Question #5- Has this occurred again since two weeks ago?
Answer-Yes"Last night my wife and daughter both were outside. At approximately 7:00P.M., the object appeared traveling west to east.
As it reached the area overhead, they saw three pink objects expelled from it. Both the object and the pink objects had a high rate of speed.
The pink objects disappeared over the horizon.The original white object descended to about 60°above the eastern horizon and suddenly disappeared."

In the interest of science and this country, I have forwarded this information to you. The first person to see the object was Dr. [redacted], Phoenix Arizona. The other two people were his wife [redacted] and daughter [redacted]. Their phone number is [redacted]. I trust that this information will be held confidential. Dr. [redacted] has agreed to be interviewed by any person wishing it.

I would rather that my name were not mentioned even though Dr. [redacted] knows that I am sending this letter.

I trust that I shall hear from you on this matter. I shall be quite interested in its outcome.

Very truly yours;
Mr. [redacted]

Mr. John P. Spaulding
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D. C.

Dear Lieutenant-Colonel Spaulding:

Thank you for your letter of July 16, regarding the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). I agree with the NICAP that UFO's are "a problem of national importance" -- maybe -- and for that reason, I am very glad the Air Force checks on these.

However, as you will see from the enclosed, which I send in case it may be of interest to you, there would seem to be some Fayettevillians who regard these flying objects, identified or unidentified, as of interstellar or cosmic importance. The Keyhoe outfit, of course, Mr. Ted Wylie, our local editor, is either more naive than one would think, or having a lot of fun with these people. I sent him your letter, and the first item is his follow-up. Later, a meeting of some local and Arkansas members of the group was covered by a reporter from the Times, with considerable publicity--and the usual frenetic reactions.

The only UFO's I have seen around these parts are (1) the tail light of a high-flying plane, (2) my ma along and (2) a strange light, hovering on the western horizon after sunset, blinking on and off a phosphorescent light, like a magnesium flare -- until I identified it as a lightning bug perched on the nearest twig of the willow tree by the back porch!

Incidentally, my letter to the NICAP, addressed to Matawan, New Jersey (the best address my memory could remember) was returned -- "Insufficient Address" -- Unknown.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Local
Line

A continuing interest is evident this summer, with more flying objects being reported, according to local sightings of reported flying kinds. The Department of the Air Force does not accept investigations of the matter, according to a letter written to yesterday's resident by long-time local writer, Ted Wylie. The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) is a private UFO organization and is in very contact with the present project. NICAP's Evidence has been received by the Air Force. It is a voluminous collection of reports, tests, materials, excerpts of investigations, etc. It is apparent to everyone that all does not appear to be explained upon the importance.

What most folks would like to know is the inside story along this line. Is the 50-cent item from the matter.

The image appears to be a scanned document page with text, but much of it is quite faint and difficult to read. In the top left corner, there is a small section of text that is partially legible, which seems to mention something about an observation or sighting. However, due to the poor quality of the scan, I can only make out fragments of words and cannot confidently transcribe the full text. The rest of the page contains more text that is largely illegible due to the low contrast and faded nature of the document.


- page 29 -

Unfortunately, while the document is visible, the text is too blurry and low-resolution to perform accurate OCR. Most of the text appears illegible due to the poor image quality. The only partially readable text I can see is on the right side of the document, which appears to say "Group Meeting In Travelville" and "Incidents Reports Of UFOs", but I cannot confidently guarantee these are the exact words.

Reporter Watches Mystery Lights Move Across Sky

(EDITOR'S NOTE - The TIMES, as well as many other newspapers in other parts of the nation, has received many reports in the past few days about unidentified objects in the night sky. Here, a TIMES reporter tells his own experience with the phenomenon.)

By WES BOLT
TIMES Staff Writer

Last night my wife and I were sitting in our back yard privileged with an assortment of cats and dogs which were keeping us company around anyway along by the name of Falk, who lives by my wife, parked to the Macs' residence.

Being aware, of course, of local happenings, I turned my binoculars in the direction some locals had two smaller blue green lights.

Reaching for my side I picked up a pair of Navy binoculars, (which just happened to be within reach) and trained them on the lights.

There appeared to be no apparent difference than seeing them with the naked eye, with whatever they are, do see some things that they wouldn't in a needs larger.

Even with binoculars, I couldn't make out any details. Do you?

Police in Area Receive Reports Of Flying Objects

Police in both Springdale and Fayetteville received reports of unidentified flying objects last night.

A Mrs. Harrison of Springdale called the Springdale police at 8:35 p.m. and reported a lighted object giving off a blue light and traveling rapidly from the south to the north over Springdale.

Twenty minutes later the Fayetteville police were alerted by Mrs. Charles Edward Craig that she and her husband had seen a strange flying object moving west and giving off a red-white light. The object stopped for five minutes, then started moving again, according to Mrs. Harrison.

Mrs. Harrison said the object was hovering over a building on the campus of the Agricultural Building at the University of Arkansas.

Police at Springdale and Fayetteville said the object was seen in the Air Force, I have no explanation.

POLICE

That UFO had been sighted over Jonesboro about 8 p.m. and again about 11 p.m.

This is the third straight day of reports of mysterious objects in the skies.

Two persons have taken pictures of what they identify as UFOs. One, a bell of Sherwood, is slightly oval burst of light that appeared

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Two UFO sightings were reported by Ernest Rahn, West Ford, Colo at 8:55 p.m. when he said he observed two bright lights traveling faster than the evening star.

The group, including Col. and Mrs. William Russell, and son, William Jr., and Mr. and Mrs. John Adair, said they saw a second group of 3 p.m. flying objects in formation as described.

UFO 'Size
Of Automobile
Is Reported
By PAT DONAT
(Times Staff Writer)

A rash of sighting reports
was made in Fayetteville City
last night.

Two were reported from the Northridge suburb and at 8:15 p.m. They said the lights came from the West, going east, and described them as being globe-shaped, two to three times larger than satellites; they had observed before. The group included Mr. and Mrs. J. Martens and daughter, July; they said they saw a pulsating light which moved vertically at about 10:35 p.m. in the southwest. Martens said he had the impression that it was triangular in shape because three points of light were brighter than the remainder of the object. The object was observed by the Martens for 15 minutes and they said there was no noise and the altitude seemed too high for a plane.

Another sighting was also reported by three University of Arkansas students who said they saw three balls of light coming from the west going east. This sighting was made near Law Building on the campus.

Another sighting, at the same time was reported by Jim Burrows who said he and three other police he had contacted said they viewed with binoculars. He reported the objects in the south part of the city. Betty Black said they saw three objects moving northeast at 8:15 p.m.

Mrs. Bill Johnson was surprised to see it at 8:15 p.m. and every 25 minutes. An Aviation Agency has said the object was normally last night. The Fayetteville Times was heavy with reports made in the morning of falling stars, jet planes and a few flying objects.

Springdale also came in for a rash of reports. When persons, including a retired Army colonel said they saw "flying marble" traveling northwest to northeast, observers were described them flying orange.

UFOs Move
Into Area
At Jonesboro
   FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) — Twelve UFO watchers saw meteors, an earth satellite and a beautiful sunrise today.
   The group convened at midnight on a mountain near Fort Smith at the urging of Tony Delaney, a radio news man who said he lost his skepticism about flying objects when he sighted some Monday night.
   Two photographers were in the group and Delaney hoped to get proof that something was in the sky. UFO reports have been coming up throughout the Mid-west during the last week.
   Delaney said Tuesday that he together with another man sighted red and green objects moving across the sky.
   He said another effort to photograph the objects will be made Saturday night.
   Meanwhile, police at Jonesboro, in Northeast Arkansas, received reports that UFO's had been sighted over Jonesboro about 8 p.m. and again about 11 p.m. Tuesday night.
   Nick Dowdy told police he watched five objects through a telescope. The objects were reported in the sky northwest of Jonesboro.

Camera Crews On Lookout
For UFOs Over Arkansas
   FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) — Camera crews staged by Fort Smith radio station KFSA will try tonight to get photographic proof that unidentified flying objects are in the air over Oklahoma and West Arkansas.
   "We'll be shooting both color and black and white," said Gary Delaney, news director of the station. "I'm personally convinced that something was in the sky on Monday night."
   Delaney said he and two others set up a UFO watch on Wildcat Mountain Monday night and made three separate sightings of strange flying objects.
   "I went out there as a skeptic, but I'm not a skeptic any more," Delaney said, his party watched a group of four objects for about five minutes, a pair of objects for about 10 minutes and a single object for several minutes.
   "We also sighted two aircraft and the Tyros weather satellite," Delaney said. "But these objects weren't aircraft. They weren't meteors, either. Meteors fly in a straight line. These things went right, left and up and down."
   Delaney said the objects were brilliant blue and green but appeared to brilliant white under acceleration.

Meteors Due
To Shower
This Week

The Earth's best known meteors will occur here Tuesday through Saturday.

The Perseid shower will reach its maximum display Thursday night, when scientists predict up to 50 meteors an hour.

Dr. Thomas Pulley, director of the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences, said the shower, which if seen at all, is caused by passage of the Earth through clouds of space dust-would add to the recent rash of flying saucer stories.

"It takes for flying saucers a newspaper sky," he said.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE
DIAL WATCH

IT'S SAUCER TIME AGAIN: "I understand there is a National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). How do I go about joining it? Does it investigate unidentified flying objects?" - Sam Butler Jr.

WATCHER, NICAP is headed by Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe. Keyhoe originally was a member of the Air Force. Project Bluebook was his first assignment investigating reports of UFOs. He became disenchanted with the Air Force's policy of not explaining statements about sightings and resigned his official regulation stating the Air Force has an official policy of discussing, investigating and reporting UFO information.

He resigned his commission and became part of NICAP, 1536 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C.

Meteorologist Claims
UFOs Just Reflections

DALLAS, Texas (AP)-Dale Milford, radio and television meteorologist, said Wednesday he believes he has found the source of what some people have called flying objects-UFOs.

His theory is that the UFOs are the reflection of light from a warmer layer of air between two cooler layers, called an inversion. The inversions can be seen by weather bureau radar.

He and Kent Bliss of the Dallas Morning News flew Wednesday at 9,000 feet early over a Dallas suburb, photographing, to which they saw reports of flying objects and by the U.S. Weather Bureau.

Milford reported that he saw a "flying object." He said it was a reflection.

The meteorologist said the object moved back and forth and changed direction horizontally.

Milford said at one period the object, or reflection, remained stationary for two minutes.

Many Texans Report Strange Objects in Sky

Unidentified flying objects were reported Tuesday night South America.

Hundreds of reports poured in to the Air Force, the Weather Bureau, newspapers and radio stations. Many were from points in Texas.

At Killeen a newsman said he saw several of the objects that appeared to be moving swiftly overhead, and at the nearby Air Force County Airport an official said a radar crew will soon conclude it was a star.

Report Flashing
Citizens at Killeen, Nacogdoches and other West Texas points said they received many reports from residents who said the UFOs flashed red and green lights as they moved slowly across the sky.

In the Valley, hundreds of miles from the East Texas sighting, Raymond Rodriguez reportedly seeing "four strange objects" that fell to the ground. He said they resembled lighted jets but also showed flashlight red, white and blue colors. He said he contained black dots in the sky, lights but "that is the shape."

From Sherman, a radio news man reported watching a bright light in the sky for more than an hour.

At Stone City, Iowa, a high school teacher reported it was a star.

More details were reported by Guy Harvey, a Cleburne, Wyo., newspaper editor, who said one hovered and moved away for UFOs and found one "mysterious."

At Albuquerque, N.M., a weather observer reported seven or eight objects near Denver, N.M. that "bobbed up and down, hove-N.M. over and over at low altitude" and darted about. One report said the objects were spotted green on the side, with a flashing red light on top.

The Oklahoma City weather observer who reported flying objects Sunday night, insisted to his Air Force base they were "no mirage." He described the UFO as an oval-shaped object with flat top and bottom "with two rings around it."

Another Oklahoma City weather observer said it was an airplane.

Joined by Another
In northern Arkansas a man reported an object that "moved back and forth" until it was joined by another, dark red in color. They flew off together, he said.

There were several reports of unidentified flying objects.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

HOUSTON, TEXAS
5 August 1965

150 CALL POST in 2 HOURS
"YOU SAW UFOS? FANCY THAT!"

These UFOs are blazing the Houston area.

About 120 persons called the Houston Post between 8 and 10 PM Wednesday to report sightings. Many others called police.

They came in various shapes - like colors, arrowheads, balls that looked like a four-leaf clover - and they went in several directions even the Ancient Mariner's star over the Doomed Stadium.

ALTHOUGH most of the callers were children, some speaking to an accompaniment of talking friends, adults also reported a number of successful sightings.

One dignified-sounding lady who lives near Rice University said an unidentified colored four-leaf clover speed-like object was over the area. She won't give her name.

ANOTHER reported an object with one red and one white light flying over his elementary school.

One that said a group of three red objects zigzagged to the southwest to the northeast horizon in 45 seconds. One of them circled to make sure it came back.

Red, orange and white were the popular aircraft. Although most reports described them in straight lines, some were erred on wiggled, one fishbowl, and another flew in a square.

NONE OF THE CALLERS sounded drunk.

Radar operators at the Houston Weather Bureau and the National Aviation Agency at the Ellington Air Force Base airport said they spotted nothing on their screens they couldn't explain.

Ellington Air Force Base personnel were unavailable for comment.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. [Two sides used]

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Houston Post 4 Aug 65
A Squadron in Brazil!

Saucers Are Flying
All Around -- Even
Landing Reported

People were looking up in Houston Tuesday night, and like hundreds of other sky-conscious observers on two continents, they were seeing things.

Reports of unidentified flying objects came from Southwest Texas, Houston, from towns throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, Minnesota and even from Brazil and Chile.

A squadron of 15 flying saucers was seen by five persons in northern Brazil's Tucano State, according to press reports from Curitiba, Brazil.

From Santiago, Chile came a report of a flying saucer which landed, but back of news a group of people who watched it, "threw up a lot of dust and a report of one possible landing."

SEVERAL HOUSTON residents who telephoned the Houston Post said Tuesday night they saw something about 8:55 PM Tuesday. Some said what they saw was orange-colored, some said red, some said green and blue.

Flying Saucers
Continued From Page 1

wife and I and two children
were sitting in the patio and
this thing was going south
west, spinning, at a high rate
of speed. It was kind of dull
gray. Found like a plate."

Bobby Field, 17, of the
Gray, and his aunt, Mrs. Janie
Field, reported seeing an
orange object move across the
sky toward the northwest at
about the same time.

THE HOUSTON Police
Department received a report
of a similar sighting at 8:55
PM Tuesday from 1330 Renard.

Other reports of sightings
came to the Post from Frank
Toscdi, 11, who lives at 502
Pogen, and from Mrs. Doolittle Brown and her son, Ronnie, who live in a rural community near Cleveland.

"I saw two of them," said
Frank, 15. "One seemed to
come from the west and one
coming from the bottom."

TUESDAY WAS the third
night in a row of police reports of UFO sightings in Texas
as told the Southwest.

Two Tarrant County Deputy
Sheriffs said they saw a
brightly lighted object tour
the ground near Justin, Tex.
miles from Denton. "Traces of
fog were seen," they added.

A policeman at Louisville,
in South Dakota County, said
he watched a multi-colored
object pass within 100 feet of
the Louisville dam.

Several Austin residents saw
mysterious objects in the sky.
An Austin meteorologist, Melvin McLaughlin, said an unidentified blip appeared on his radar screen early Tuesday.

OTHER REPORTS come
from Norman, Okla., Minneapolis ND Saint Paul, Minn.
and Billings, Montana.

The sighting of the "squadron" in Brazil was first made
by the Brazilian press. They
saw four colors coming
over the horizon in broad daylight at Astoria, about 250
miles west of Sao Paulo.

The girls called these sightings "flying saucers" and
other saucers flying in formation.

A SPOKESMAN for Tinker
Air Force Base in Oklahoma
City said an official dispatch
from Washington gave two
possible explanations for the
reported phenomena:

1) Weather conditions have
been favorable for "scientific
natural" radar phenomena.

2) Weather conditions have
been favorable for "scattering" -- a method when soon
to middle distance objects
can be seen under certain
layers of the atmosphere.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    2    December    1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My brother had seen a similar object a few nights before and said that it seemed as if it was only half as big. The object he saw was running at high speed. (object might) was moving in space to the horizon.

I understand my brother's knowledge that meteors do not move down or rising, stationary, if some the object couldn't have been what a meteor.

It seemed as if this object may be have fallen or landed in a field.

4 mile away.

I know that meteors are very rare but here could my brother and I both see a green meteor within a few nights of such like and yet almost the exact location.

It was not sure of the object was ground because it was trailing so fast.

However, due to the handwritten nature and some crossed-out words, I cannot confidently transcribe the entire text without potentially introducing errors. The text appears to discuss an object moving in a certain way, with references to a weather event and some details about the observation, but a precise word-for-word transcription would require careful verification.]

Dear Sir,

I have enclosed today file 64 to explore. In this envelope, I think it may have been seen at this or you may before but I did then see. I'd I think I didn't quite get enough information in them. You didn't tell me to then we received. I think I didn't tell my address.

37. Additional info. Pastel pictures enclosed should come to subjects reported in any section to net locations.

However I'd like to add: Picture A - I mentioned I saw something falling (they said no). It could be possible sometime was dropped or they didn't notice it. It was while sliding to beautiful sight, so occasionally my wife could never see above it. My husband let me have his 35 mm camera but by the time I got it the matters was less definite and I didn't hold camera steady. The slide and info I had recorded on all this disappeared. If I find it will send it to Int, it would not add much anyway.

The sunset picture A resembled a picture of a cosmic fault where the earth layers dropped one star down through whole side of separated section. To me I first thought it was a trail left by a jet that fell (never saw one of these so don't) then I thought it could be a plane crash or parachute fall and created this funnel (both like shape) or dummy practices bomb. End of summer & day when no boats were out. We sailed our dingy 7 years to this date in this location when we didn't do boating. We come to look at scenery. I saw the most spectacular things in sky and water patterns - alone but none like this. Thought it could also be an air rocket which would twist clouds same way as whirlpool does in water.

On way home the following scene repeated 7 times (too even for nature I thought)?

The picture B made me think of planes that had gone down in flames and made a smoke trail above them but not 7 in a row. Could be sky writers learning the trade with very stuff or crop dusters or someone playing around up there or experimenting. By 7 whirlpools.

Sun had gone along with sky coloring by the time we got home 5 minute trip but it was plenty of light and clear vision. Clouds were all above smoke or clouds.

[Handwritten notes at bottom partially illegible]

Would like to have stopped to ask firemen to look at two smoky points from the sky almost in direction of the woods section that were putting out the fire. Couldn't do it unless I was alone. Remember seeing a similar sight with one fire before, at or near location. [Last line partially illegible]

Here is the text from the document:

Mailed Aug.

Read an article in Readers Digest about a night watchman receiving compensation for illness suffered from some carbure ODOR to be said was due from an object over him.

A few years ago before reading this fantastic story I was awakened one night by an odor that was impossible to analyze. The closest I could come up with was human beings being burned. I never smelled any to compare with it so tried to add my 6th sense or 5th.

It bore in strong throughout rear of house - could hear or see nothing - pitch black out. Side window next to it seemed possible to leave even a crack obtaining the air coming from front of house. A very warm night in summer. We have dogs and cassarols but couldn't break it down to even make my brother's chemistry bomb & experiments as a lid.

Stifling is only word I could use.

There is also a hand-drawn sketch in the bottom right corner of the page with labels "BACK", "S W", "FRONT", and some lines indicating directions.

This image appears to be a map of Long Island with sections for "Airports and Seaplane Bases" and "Yacht and Boat Clubs" and "Golf and Country Clubs" listed in columns below the map. The map shows various roads, towns, and the Atlantic Ocean. The map is divided into numbered grid sections from 14 to 20. The document looks like a reference or directory page with extensive listings in multiple columns. Due to the image quality and small text, many specific details are difficult to read clearly.

This image appears to be a detailed road map of Long Island, New York. The map shows numerous roads, highways, towns, and geographical features. Some partially legible text can be seen, including "Long Island" at the bottom left of the map. The map is black and white and appears to be from an older era, likely the 1960s based on the context provided. There is a small legend or information box in the top right corner, but the text is too small and blurry to read clearly in this image.

There is a compass rose in the top right indicating cardinal directions. The map is in black and white and appears to be from an older document, with some areas labeled such as "Sound" and "Conn" visible. The map is quite intricate, showing many small roads and geographical features. Due to the image resolution and age of the document, some of the smaller text labels are difficult to read clearly.

This image appears to be a detailed road map or topographical map. The map shows numerous interconnected roads, highways, and geographical features. At the bottom of the map, "Hudson River" is clearly visible. The map is in black and white and shows a complex network of lines representing roads, boundaries, and possibly waterways. The map seems to cover a significant geographical area with many small labeled regions or locations, though most labels are too small to read clearly in this image.

At the top left of the map, "Hudson River" is visible. The map is in black and white and shows a dense road system covering what seems to be a large geographic area. The roads are drawn with varying thickness and connect in intricate patterns across the page. The map appears to be somewhat aged or vintage in appearance.

P.S. Since all this happened so long ago didn't want to send it locally tho, I don't want my husband or others to know about my sending this report in.

If you want more information use my full first name (no UFO lettering on envelope) and send me some UFO report forms to make it easier.

I have a small boy almost able to escape olydren and won't have the time or the energy to work this into my already hectic schedule......

Have one more report - art work is complete (book movies type). This one is about a comet hitting a red light and I was happy to find out accidentally it was reported by a woman in Australia in mans or True magazine a year or two ago.

"Once I don't see anything else for years this is too much work,,,,,

After putting all this stuff down I sympathise with you too.

Brazil
Aug 65

In Brazil, a man named Joao da Rio was fishing one day in early August when a tiny man about 28 inches high allegedly came up to him. The creature had large luminous eyes and spoke perfect Portuguese, according to the witness. Joao was informed by the visitor that he had come from another world, and as proof, he offered a piece of "unearthly" metal, which is now analyzed. Joao is described by his employer as a "simple, honest man." ....

but my brother said he thought it was a
satellite so we decided not to tell. Yesterday the next day in the paper my
brother read about a satellite that was
visible but I said that it was a U.F.O. for
2 reasons:

1. It shoot out from its place
and an exhaust or thrust
was visible.

2. It stopped for about

It was in August I think in the summer of 1965. We (me and my brother) were out on the lawn watching the stars, especially one big one that was very bright) and all of sudden a little star. Shook out from its bigger one at first we thought it was a shooting star but as soon as it broke away it slowed down and just sort of cruised around (whatever) in one direction. When it did shoot out it looked like it left a white thrust flame but state only that it left any part of a trail. After we were watching it for while, it stopped for about 30 seconds and started up again and from then on it got a little red. Then we saw it starting to descend so we ran to the side of front house, and it disappeared in front of its own surprise its moon I think. This was only a coincident though life were going

Violet light again
The Barksda district of August 2
tells how--"Villagers at Belluco, in
Chile's southern Puerto Rico Monte
district reported that they saw a strange
apparatus land in the village for five
minutes and then take off again. It
took off and landed farther away.

"More than 15 people keeping a
traditional all-night vigil beside the
body of a young girl killed in a road
accident reported seeing the object.
They said that a violet light entered
the room where the girl lay and they
went outside to see where it came
from. They saw a strange object giving
off a dazzling violet light. They could
not tell the shape of it, they said,
because the light was so blinding.

"As they stood there, the object
took off without a sound."

Lima, Peru
1 Aug 65

LANDINGS IN PERU: Among dozens of important UFO observations in Peru this past summer, are three landing stories which have a fair amount of detail in the newspaper accounts that have been sent to us.

The first account on about August 15, in a suburb of the capital city of Lima, where a 15-year-old boy named Alberto San Roman Nunez saw a small flying saucer at rest slightly on the roof of his home. The boy was on the roof taking in some wash when he was approached by a being about 3½ feet tall with had apparently emerged from the saucer. Greenish lights on his skin which made him look like a frog. Terrified, Alberto ran down the stairs. As he did so, he was enveloped in a circular craft which he saw pass over the roof heading toward the nearby ocean. Presumably the little man was inside the craft.

Thereafter, an examination of the roof revealed four circles, each about a foot in diameter. These were in the shape of a square, in relation to each other; and another strange marking was found at the center of the square. These four circles corresponded to the position of four leg-like appendages which Alberto had seen at the bottom of the saucer machine.

Family Reports
Sighting Saucer

SYDNEY, Australia (Reuters) — A chorus of howling dogs woke up the McGinlock family early Saturday, and brought them rushing out of their farmhouse to see — they reported later — a flying saucer hovering over the farmyard.

The object had three rods protruding, one from the top and two from the bottom. It emitted two beams of light.

The object remained over the farmyard for about 15 minutes before moving off. Two of the McGinlock boys, 12 and 10, admitted they saw it the day before but kept it secret.

The incident was reported at Goonumbla, New South Wales.

Wichita, Kansas

SCIENTIST REFUTES AIR FORCE CLAIM THAT HUGE WESTERN SAUCER FLAP WAS CAUSED BY STARS! Unidentified objects which were picked up on radar on August 22d at the Wichita, Kansas, weather bureau, as well as elsewhere throughout the mid-west and west, were said by the Air Force to be the planet Jupiter or associated stars. But Robert Risser, Director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation, planetarium in Oklahoma City (where numerous sightings were also made), and Wichita local residents contacted, said not to accept any of the stars which the Air Force listed in their explanatory report. "This statement by the Air Force is as far from the truth as you can get. Somebody has made a mistake. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year."

The sightings in question came in during the early days of August from Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. In addition to numerous radar sightings, there were literally hundreds of appearances reported by private citizens and well as police. But the Air Force stated, after a very superficial investigation, that the sightings were probably of the planet Jupiter or the stars Rigel, Capella, Betelgeuse, and Aldebaran.

ANOTHER LANDING IN CHILE: Again thanks to our South American Editor, Mr. Von Hegel, we have learned of still another saucer landing. This one occurred on August 2nd in Llanguithua, Chile, and was witnessed by the Secretary General of the National Health Department, for that area, as well as a large group of people who happened to be with him. The article does not state how far the group was from the UFO when it landed, but it does tell us that some of the women present were so overcome by emotion that they fainted. Some of the men fortunately braced themselves, and when they did so, it took off at high speed. When they reached the landing spot, they found a round charred area the circumference of which had been severely burned. Several trees had been charred and uprooted.

Bells, Texas

TV Newsman Snaps
UAO Photos

On the morning of 2 August 1965, photographer Robert Campbell was lying in bed at his home at Bells, Texas, listening to police broadcast. His attention was arrested by conversations concerning an unconventional serial object being tracked by radar (apparently at Tinker Air Force Base) and which was heading south. His source was the Texas State Police, the only part of the conversation he could monitor.

When he heard the information that the object, a blue-white light, was south of Durant, he took his 4x5 Speed Graphic camera and went into Bells where he encountered Police Chief Pete McCollum. They drove around until they were 1 mile east of Bells on Highway 82 where they spotted the object hanging motionless at 45 degrees elevation in the northeast. Campbell set up his tripod and took four time exposures of 2 minutes each, at 3 minute intervals. The photographs, on black and white film, show a misty, slowing object with traces of what appears to be vapor on its surface.

After watching about 2½ hours, during which the object appeared to hover deadstill in the air, Campbell and McCollum left the area, went home and to bed.

Having been alerted by the same radio broadcast, several other individuals were also watching the object. Campbell and McCollum were joined by Highway Patrolman Bill Quires was watching from Durant, 30 miles north of Bells, and Department of Public Safety Dispatcher, Jim Taglis was watching from a point seven miles south of Sherman, which is 12 miles west of Bells. None of these observers stayed to see the object depart.

The interesting point in this sighting is the number of observers as well as the difference between the naked eye observations and what the object looked like on film. Campbell said the object appeared as a blue-white sphere with well-defined edges.

Sky Objects Reported
In Globe-Miami Area

GLOBE — These Trans flying saucers apparently made
detour over Arizona Monday night, according to reports made
to police agencies here.

The Arizona Highway Patrol's Miami office and Gila County
Sheriff's office received calls reporting two "red and white"
flying objects.

One resident reported seeing the objects and described the
situation:

"The Air Force said there's no proof of these things coming
from outer space."

The Arizona Republic added that the Air Force officials did
not say they didn't come from outer space.

The distance between the two sightings is between 50 and 75
miles.

DENNIS WAGNER, 19, a student at Central State, expected the woman to look relieved when she came rushing back to the laundromat looking for her purse, but he was hardly prepared for the gasp of relief she emitted when he handed it over to her.

It turned out, though, the purse contained $4,000 in cash.

LORNA McKEMIE tells about the signboard just out of Price, Utah, that proclaims: "Two Finishes For Your Automobile - Liquor And Lacquer."

A READER calls in to tell about the man who was western parking lot attendant who, while he ran his battery down, hunking at his own tail lights.

OUR NEIGHBOR'S son came home from school the other day and tearfully announced that Paul had taken his pencil. His parents consoled him and sent him off the next day with a new pencil.

That afternoon the scene was re-enacted and that did it! The boy's father went to see Paul's father after supper. "I'm the principal," he said, "my son can't get all the pencils I want at the office."

THE GUY ACROSS the desk says he hates to leave home because the cat can't stand to kiss his wife goodbye.

YOU HAVE TO GO way back for this one.

It took place during the Roosevelt era - there was this little old woman who introduced the new deacon to her husband who was a little deaf and a Republican.

"Darling," she said, "This is the new Dealer," - murmured the old gent inaudibly.

At the bottom of the page, there is a caption for a photograph labeled "Rare Saucer Photograph":

The picture above is believed to be the first night color photograph of an unidentified flying object, commonly called a flying saucer. The picture, showing a clearly-defined yellow, blue and whitish egg-shaped object in the sky, was shot by Alan Smith, 14-year-old. Take boy. Aug. 2 when a rash of flying objects were reported over Oklahoma skies. Alan, his father, sister and neighbor pal were watching the object when Alan shot the one exposure on...

Here is the OCR text from the document:

went to east.

Alan and he saw the object first, then Smith saw it. At the house, picked up the camera, returned outside and waited until it was almost overhead before exposing the one negative.

Members of the family said they heard a whine increased as the object speeded up. There was also an increase in the intensity of the lights that first appeared white.

A star, turning red as it came closer, grating, turning blue, then green then cream white, Smith said.

The object appeared as if it were illuminated by searchlights.

The family reported dogs in the neighborhood started barking when the object appeared.

Members of the family said they could not see the definition of lights as it appeared on the color negative. This indicated, experts say, that the camera was able to pick up something that the human eye was unable to see.

"Atmospheric conditions that night included a dull moon, with a clear sky and a dual horizon."

The Smiths were first interviewed by Jim Kervan, aviation editor of the Journal, who heard of the matter through a Tulsa newspaper. Other interviews were conducted by Bill Boykin, assistant editor, W. P. Bill Adkinson, publisher, Howes and Cliff King, photographer.

Journal editors asked all persons who personally had seen flying objects in the past to communicate by letter with the newspaper. Complete with descriptions, etc., will be sent on to military authorities in an effort to help determine origin of the strange lights and objects.

"In the future, we ask anyone who sees a 'flying saucer' or object in the sky to call the Journal," they said.

They asked that letters, with descriptions, be sent to The Oklahoma Journal, 7430 SE 15, Oklahoma City.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT HR 66-21
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 9 June 1965

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION TULSA, OKLAHOMA, USA DATE 2 August 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF One Kodacolor negative and one 8" x 10" color print IR QUALITY Good

News article "The Oklahoma Journal" 5 October 1965

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order Number 66-43 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., TEC/UFO, requesting a photo analysis of an alleged unidentified flying object photographed at Tulsa, Oklahoma on 2 August 1965.

2. ANALYSIS: The following analysis represents a joint effort of the Photo Processing (DPP) and Photo Analysis (DPA) Divisions. Based upon the information furnished, we can neither confirm nor deny the identification of an unidentified flying object. The somewhat oval-shaped, tri-colored object shown in the photograph is believed to be an object; however, the following comments are furnished as discussion. The object is quite clear with a rather well-defined sizes and clarity of detail. Measurement of image size on the negative resulted in a 2.5 mm size rather than the 1.5 mm stated in the news article. Using the 2.5 image size, the camera/range data quoted in the article, the object becomes approximately 30 feet in diameter - or some 100 smaller than the article - at a range of less than one mile. Some question arises however as to the accuracy of the range determination (camera to subject) at the time of day (0115) and under the conditions stated in the news article. Range is very difficult to determine at night and cannot usually be determined accurately even by experienced pilots. A further question is posed as to why some local differences are in the sky were recorded on the film in that atmospheric conditions on the night of 2 August 1965 were described as a dull moon with a clear sky and stars. Some local variations in a sky background are usually observed even on night photography. The only variation observed in this case was a line centered by a somewhat circular area of a haze bearing a resemblance, although doesn't appear identical to the effect they have observed obtaining when photographing a multi-colored revolving stellar flood light of the type used to illuminate and color aluminum trees during the Christmas season.

Of Pontiff Stirs Crowd
NEW YORK (UPI)—Pope Paul VI climaxing a day of historic pilgrimage Monday night with a ritual of exquisite beauty in the brawling arena of Yankee stadium focused on his frail figure in the white robes of peace.

The appeal of the shy pope softly brought crowds of at least four million to the sidewalks of New York's great melting pot and 90,000 more jammed the stadium to see the pilgrim Pope of peace in his first public mass on the spot where Babe Ruth held sway.

Paul came to this most opulent of the world's cities with a cry for peace. And, for the most, the crowds were curiously subdued and in awe at the sight of the pontiff, his face occasionally wreathed in a smile and his arms extended in embrace or raised in benediction.

His stay in the cold night packed with the greatest crowds in its 12-year history as men and women of all faiths watched the Pope celebrate the mass.

The spectacle was telecast throughout the United States and seen by Early Bird Satellite live a potential 14 million viewers in Europe and behind the Iron Curtain.

Standing in an open car, the Pope circled once and a half times around the stadium more accustomed to the lines of baseball heroes than papal benedictions.

Warm Up Due Today
By United Press International

Thick clouds, light rains and soft winds held the mercury down Monday in Oklahoma, but a slow warmup was expected to begin Tuesday.

Flights ranged from a cool 44 at Hobart to 72 at Tulsa, with rainfall under .10 in. Ardmore had 65 an inch of precipitation.

Lows Monday night were expected to be in the 50s, in high Tuesday from 65 to 70.

The west was expected to be partly cloudy with slightly warmer temperatures through Tuesday night. The southeast will be partly cloudy with occasional rain.

Crowd Subdued
4 Million Cheer Pope
NEW YORK (UPI)—A shy man in the white robes of peace came to this most militant of the world's cities yesterday and was extended a quiet smile and his arms raised in embrace or benediction.

Police Commissioner Vincent Broderick estimated in a 4-mile-long people had seen the Pope during the day.

The sight of the frail figure of Pope Paul VI, his face occasionally wreathed in a quiet smile and his arms extended in embrace or benediction, raised a great melting pot.

There was a scene of great applause that brought tears to many eyes inside usually hushed St. Patrick's Cathedral.

There were cries of "Viva Il Papa," and even shouts of "Hey, Paul!" as the papal motorcade moved through a panoramic of neighborhoods from the glitter of Harlem to the glitter of Fifth Avenue.

Thera was the pomp and circumstance of the papal presence with representatives of the 117 countries at the world's fair.

He made history's first papal visit to the United States. He came here as a pilgrim to plead for peace before the United Nations but the emotional highlight of the visit was a mass Monday night at Yankee Stadium.

It was a long and tiring day for the frail 68-year-old pontiff who was up before dawn at the Vatican and arrived here at 7:25 a.m. CST. Before his departure Monday, he completed a schedule that never before equalled by a reigning Pope.

The Pope's plane lifted off at 9:20 p.m. CST.

He rode in a 2½-mile motorcade through New York, spoke at the United Nations, conferred with the President, made 11 speeches, talked with Jewish and Protestant leaders, celebrated a mass and delivered a sermon at Yankee Stadium and visited the Vatican pavilion at the world's fair.

He was greeted by a sea of flags and cheers of the military and civilian crowds.

Yankee Stadium Mass
Pope Paul VI, wearing mitre, delivers his sermon at the Papal Mass for Peace at Yankee Stadium Monday night.

Pope Says Peace
Key To Survival
NEW YORK (UPI)—Pope Paul VI warned the United Nations during a historic 14-hour visit to the United States Monday that mankind must find permanent peace or perish. Persuasive, the pontiff's peace pilgrimage "may be just what the world needs."

Crowds of at least four million hailed the pontiff as he made his first papal visit to the United States. He came as a pilgrim to the United Nations before an emotional highpoint of the visit was a mass Monday night at Yankee Stadium.

1. If you have a camera, keep it loaded with color film.
If you see an unidentified flying object in the sky, shoot a
picture and you may have the second known color photo
of a flying saucer.
2. If you don't have a camera and see a UFO, call the
Journal immediately and give our professional photographers
an opportunity to make the picture.
3. If you have already seen UFO, please send us complete details in a letter, giving time of sighting, description
and all details. The information, with your permission, will
be sent to proper authorities for evaluation. Send to The

First Night Color Shot
Of Flying Saucer Bared

[Article Text - Flying Saucer Story]
Copyright 1965 by The Oklahoma Journal Publishing Co.

At approximately 1:45 a.m. on August 2, Alan Smith, 14, standing in the back yard of his Tulsa home, pointed his small camera toward the darkened sky and clicked the shutter.

The image was recorded on color negative and may become the most famous photo-graph of our age.

Young Smith was sighting his camera at an unidentified flying object in the sky. He and his father had observed the UFOs August 1 and this night were prepared.

The image he got is believed to be the first night color picture of what is commonly called a flying saucer. The picture is eerie. The consequence of the one-in-a-million shot are far-reaching.

The negative shows a yellow, blue and whitish egg-shaped object, clearly defined in the sky. Protruding from the object are three tiny fingers which many have speculated may be the propulsion system. They could have been something else.

The picture was taken on a night when a rash of UFO's were sighted in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Norman and other points throughout the southwest.

These were explained by the Air Force as swamp gas, a weather balloon, or a satellite.

went to east. From my back yard, it looked to be the size of a basketball or soccer ball.

"It again appeared as a ball of light, but moved slower than it did the first night. It was changing color from white, to red to blue-green. It's light pulsated with a high rate of speed."

When he came closer to the light he said the light was brighter. It gave us the creeps."

Five persons in the immediate vicinity saw the object that second night.

[Personal Details]
They included: Alan, his father, A. L. Smith, 40, a turbine engine inspector for American Airlines in Tulsa; his sister, Sheryl Holt, 18; Sheryl's husband, Ron Holt, 18, and a neighbor boy, Daryl Swimmer, 15. Alan's family lives at 4719 S, 29 W, Tulsa.

The Swimmer family lives at 4721 S, 29 W.

Smith, his son and daughter and her husband and the neighbor, whose son is a member of the Holt family, saw the light in the sky but pointed out that it did not appear the same as it does in Alan's color picture.

"It was not a blob of light," he said. "When it was first seen, it was a very bright light."
