Dear Sirs:

In the course of a conversation the other day, a person mentioned the sighting of an unidentified flying object to me. Since I do have a rather large interest in this field, I interviewed the person who was involved in the sighting. I thought you might be interested in his answers to several questions which I put to him.

Question #1 was—What were the conditions under which you saw the object in the sky? The answer was that it was a clear night with a few clouds. "It was about 5:30 p.m. when I first spotted the object in the sky. It seemed to be shining as from the reflected light of the sun. It had a fantastic speed. As it reached the southwestern horizon, it suddenly, four pink objects shot out of it, one to each point of the compass. The pink objects were going at a fantastic rate of speed. As the white object continued to descend, it stopped 30° above the horizon."

Question #2 was—Did anything occur when the object stopped?
Answer was—"The object changed color from reddish-pink, to green, to yellow-orange."

Question #3 was—Next, what happened?
Answer was that the object kept changing colors and then suddenly disappeared.

Question #4 was— Was there any noise or sound that caught your attention? Answer was negative.

NCIO FILE WITH 2-24-65
RE-EXAMINATION AND ANALYSES

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS, AUGUST 22, 1965, TINELLIA, CALIFORNIA. TWO REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS RECEIVED.

OBJECTIVE: To check all possible data on the scene and to find any additional data in the original report. 
NOTE: Original report was written in California and was determined by this office to have originating data.

GENERAL RE-EXAMINATION: Object positions were measured at the scene. Sightings were plotted on the panorama. This was done to determine the elevation angles, azimiths, and relative positions of the objects observed. The objects therefore are those dealt with in the original report. Descriptions have been made from the data in the report, with some additional information obtained. Further clarification on the point from which the drawing was made, exact time of observations, color, size, and distances, is necessary.

CONCLUSIONS: (As shown in diagram) "A" maximum elevation, 73.4° "B" maximum elevation, 60.5° while rising over nearby hills. 
Objects B: Minimum elevation, 16.6° while rising over hills, as described in the original report.
Objects C: Minimum elevation, 13.6° while rising. Also recorded in elevation over buildings, 14.1° and 14.3° respectively, in two additional observations.

Object D: Minimum elevation, approximately 5.9° maximum elevation.

The apparent elevation or several landmarks was measured from the point of observation to determine orientation. Some conclusions of the original data are confirmed in these measurements.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book that contains text describing the examination of a photo.

EXAMINATION OF PHOTO B:
The photo was not of objects in the sky but rather of an object on the ground. There are no observations or measurements of the object itself, but rather an examination of the photographic quality and technical details. The report describes the shutter speed, exposure time, and other details of the photographic process that was used to capture the image. It also notes that the shutter was opened and closed, suggesting this was not a single exposure photograph.

The text output from the OCR is as follows:

EXAMINATION OF PHOTO B:
This photo was not of objects in the sky but rather an object on the ground. The photo was obtained from a witness who claimed to have observed the object on the ground. There were no actual observations or measurements of the object itself, but rather an examination of the photographic quality and technical details. The report describes the shutter speed, exposure time, and other details of the photographic process that was used to capture the image. It also notes that the shutter was opened and closed, suggesting this was not a single exposure photograph.

Producing the dotted star trails, by comparison with photo 3, the exposure length was determined to be at least 3 minutes. The film used was a high speed panchromatic film. The characteristics of this photo indicate that it was obtained under relatively poor conditions, with a low ambient light level. COMMENTS ON THIS PHOTO: The fact that no other star trails are visible indicates that the UFO object is illuminated, unlike the background stars. The object appears to be stationary. The report concludes that this film was developed and printed by OTHERS elsewhere than the Project Blue Book lab, and that the quality is less than that normally obtained.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document containing text only.

Transcribing the text from the document:

GENERAL COMMENTS: It is interesting that all witnesses have agreed that the object was observed for only a short time, even the photographer, as can be verified by the written statement that the camera shutter was open only for a brief moment.

Even the photographer, although he obtained what may be a photograph of the object, has indicated that he saw the object only for an instant, and that only a small part of the object may have been recorded on the film. This would indicate that the object was moving rapidly.

The photographs, although they may be valid, should be considered as secondary in importance to the written statements obtained from the witnesses, as the photographic evidence can be confusing and misleading. The written statements, on the other hand, are clear and straightforward and are considered the best evidence in this case.

Question #3- Has this occurred again since two weeks ago?
Answer-Yes "Last night my wife and daughter both were outside. At approximately 7:00 P.M. the object appeared traveling west to east. As it receded the area overhead, they saw three pink objects expel 
from it. Both the object and the pink objects had a high rate of speed. The pink objects disappeared over the horizon. The original white object decreased to about 50 percent in size and suddenly disappeared."
In the interest of science and this country, I have forwarded this information to you. The first portion to see the object was Dr. Phoenix, Arizona. The other two people were his wife and daughter. Their phone number .
I trust that this information will be held confidential.
Dr. has agreed to be interviewed by any person wishing it. I would rather that my name were not mentioned even though Dr. knows that I am sending this letter.
I trust that I shall hear from you on this matter. I shall be quite interested in its outcome.

Very truly yours,
Mr. [redacted]

August 10, 1965

Dear Lieutenant-Colonel Spaulding:

Thank you for your letter of July 16, regarding the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). I am very glad the Air Force checks on them.

However, as you will note from the enclosure, which I send in case it may be of interest to you, there would seem to be some Payette civilians who regard these flying saucer identifications as a sort of Freak Show. The enclosed clipping, from an editor, is either more naive than one would think, or having a lot of fun with these incidents. Incidentally, the group was covered by a reporter from the Times, with considerable publicity-and that is usual.

The only UFO's I have seen around these parts are (1) the tall light of a high-flying plane, and (2) a strange light, hovering on the horizon until it moved off rapidly. Neither of these was photographed. It's a pity your scientists cannot identify the ones that have been photographed on the horizon stars. Until identified, I suspect them to be phenomena that are not understandable to the lay mind.

Incidentally, my letter to the NICAP, addressed to Matawan, New Jersey (the best address I could remember) was returned - "Insufficient Address."

Sincerely,
Richard Harris Bumpus

TED WYLIE

Dear Sir: During August 1952 at about 11:30 PM, I observed an unusual object in the sky above San Mateo, California. The object was brightly lighted and moved in a horizontal direction at a relatively slow speed for several minutes. It then appeared to accelerate and move rapidly out of sight.

I have read of similar sightings reported to the Air Force and wondered if you would be interested in this report. If so, I would be glad to give you any further details you may desire.

Sincerely yours,
TED WYLIE

Text extracted from the document:

POLICE IN both Springdale and Fayetteville, Arkansas reported receiving calls of flying objects around 9:00 p.m. Tuesday, August 4, 1965. The Springdale Police reported seeing lights that hovered over the area for sometime and then 'took off at a terrific rate of speed.'

Mrs. Charles Edward Craig, who lives near the area, reported seeing a reddish white light over the Springdale area. She said it hovered and 'acted like it was beating its wings.' Another resident, Mr. H.B. James, said he saw the flying object and it was 'larger than a star and smaller than a planet.'

Police in both cities said they did not have any explanation for the reported sightings. This is the third time in the past several months that flying objects have been reported in the area.

Two UFO sighting were observed from the Coyote Vista area of San Mateo, California on the afternoon of August 7, 1965. The incident was reported to the U.S. Air Force and an investigation followed.

The observers, William H. Jewell and his wife Elizabeth, were viewing the western horizon from their home at the time. They observed two round, light-colored objects which appeared to be hovering in the sky. The objects were observed for several minutes before they moved away rapidly and disappeared from sight.

The Jewells said the objects seemed to be metallic and were reflecting the sun's rays. They also said the objects moved very rapidly and disappeared into the northwest.

The image contains a newspaper article titled "UFO - 'Size of Automobile' is Reported". The article discusses a reported UFO sighting near Prattville, California, describing the object as being the size of an automobile and the details surrounding the sighting.

UFO - 'Size of Automobile' is Reported
(TEXT FROM THE ARTICLE)
(FAY DONAT, PRATTVILLE [CALIF.])
A UFO, described as being the size of an automobile, was sighted by three people at Prattville, approximately 25 miles northeast of Sacramento, Calif., on Monday, June 9.
The object, according to the three witnesses, was seen at 11:15 p.m. as they were driving along Highway 70. It was described as hovering over the road in front of them, about 100 feet in the air, and giving off a brilliant, white light. After about a minute, the object shot straight up and disappeared from view.
Mrs. Bill Johnson, who was driving the car, told The Record, a Prattville newspaper, that she and her two companions were traveling south on Highway 70 when the incident occurred. "We were driving along and all of a sudden we saw this brilliant white light in front of us, not too high off the ground," she said. "It seemed to be hovering over the road. We stopped the car and watched it for about a minute. Then it shot straight up and disappeared. I've never seen anything like it before."
The object was seen by Mrs. Johnson, her daughter Mrs. Claude Norton, and another woman, Mrs. Hinkle. Mrs. Norton said the object was "perfectly round" and gave off a brilliant white light. "It was so bright it hurt our eyes to look at it," she added. "It just hovered there for about a minute and then took off straight up and was gone."
Mrs. Hinkle also described the object as being "the size of an automobile" and stated that it was "giving off a brilliant white light." "It was definitely not an airplane or a satellite," she said. "I've never seen anything like it before in my life."
The three women reported the incident to the Butte County Sheriff's office, which in turn notified the Air Force. Lt. Henry A. Mebane, public information officer at Beale AFB, said the Air Force is investigating the report.

Camera Crews On Lookout
For UFOs Over Arkansas

FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) - Unidentified flying objects have been sighted over Arkansas, and television camera crews are trying to get proof that unidentified flying objects are in the air. 

"We'll be shooting both color and black and white film," Delaney said in a telephone conversation with station KFSA, who is himself convinced that unidentified flying objects are visiting the area. "I'm convinced that a ground crew for a well-known national network has been alerted and will be out shooting film."

Delaney said he and a group of four others have witnessed the sightings for about five minutes on two different evenings. "They were brilliant red and green but changed to a brilliant white under observation," Delaney added.

Meanwhile, police at Jonesboro in northeast Arkansas, say they have received numerous reports of unidentified flying objects being sighted over Jonesboro about 8:30 p.m. Monday.

Nick Dowe, a Jonesboro resident, told police he watched five objects through a telescope for about five minutes. "They were brilliant red and green but changed to a brilliant white under observation," Dowe said.

Meteorologist Claims UFOs Just Reflections
DALLAS, TEX. (AP) - A Dallas meteorologist claims the mysterious objects seen in the sky are just reflections of bright objects in the atmosphere, the U.S. Weather Bureau said Monday.
Dallas meteorologist Ray Wood said he believes the flying objects reported to authorities and the Air Force as "unidentified flying objects" - UFOs - are merely reflections of bright stars, planets or other objects high in the atmosphere which are lighted by the sun and reflect its rays.
His theory is that the UFO's are the reflection of two objects moving between two celestial layers, with the UFO effect being caused by the refraction of light between the two layers.
The U.S. Weather Bureau said it found no unusual atmospheric conditions that would cause such reflections. However, it said that Wood's theory could account for some UFO reports.

The image contains a newspaper article with a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object. The article discusses reports of strange objects seen in the sky by many Texans, including a sketch by a witness named Mrs. Edna Dillin of Dallas. The article also mentions other reported sightings of unidentified objects in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas.

Unidentified, CA 4-6868                HOUSTON CHRONICLE        Wednesday, August 4, 1965   Section 1  Page 13

Many Texans Report Strange Objects in Sky
Unidentified flying objects were reported Tuesday night in south Texas.
According to the Air Force, the Weather Bureau, news agencies and military installations, many were from points in Texas.
At least a dozen persons said they saw the objects that hovered and darted about in the sky, and at the nearby Arlington County Airport an official of the Federal Aviation Agency said he noticed and was told about the phenomena by a pilot.
Report Flashing Lights
Civilians at Killeen, Newton, Sweetwater and other East Texas points said they received many reports from residents, who said the lights flashed on and off and darted across the sky.
In the Valley, hundreds of miles from the East Texas reports, a flying saucer was reportedly hovering over a ranch house near San Antonio at 10 p.m.
Mrs. Edna Dillin of Dallas shows sketch of unidentified flying object she observed through telescope early Tuesday.

One person the Chan also showed a flashed red, white and blue lights but "did not fly space."
More colorful UFOs were reported to the City Harvey, a Coy. In northern Minnesota, a high school science teacher said one beamed a light on his car as he drove into the country to look for them, and found one "hovering over the trees."
In Junction City, Kan., a state police trooper took a picture (direction), but also noticed many odd maneuvers of a silvery, disc-observed craft which apparently landed in a field.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
HOUSTON, TEXAS 
2 AUGUST 1955

HOUSTON FOBT - 13/50 CALLS PER 24 HOURS
"FLYING SAUCER" SIGHTINGS" 
Houston area. -- Reliable 15 to 20 persons reported sightings of what appeared to be a large bright light of unknown purpose in the sky Wednesday to report "existence". One person described it as "like a moon," another as "soareer than star," others said they saw "shooting beams of light," "saucer-like evasive movements," balls and bar shapes. One person suggested it was a "mother ship" with "little ones" breaking off from it. Several suggested it was a "craft" controlled by some intelligent being.
One man said a group of witnesses had seen it split into 2 parts. Another reported an object rise from the ground and join the large "saucer." Several reported seeing it take off at a high rate of speed, disappearing as it went "straight up." The Houston International Airport and the Houston Intercontinental Air Force Base reported nothing unusual in their observations. As customary, the Air Force said their radar did not pick up any such objects, but the sightings were nevertheless reported to the Air Force.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text on the page discusses "Unidentified flying objects" and describes various sightings and reports, including one about a "squadron in Brazil" where "Saucers Are Flying All Around--Even Landing Reported".

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
Houston Post 
4 August 1965

A SQUADRON IN BRAZIL 
Saucers Are Flying All Around--Even Landing Reported

Continued from Page 1

Several Austin residents now
residing in Brazil report strange
objects in the skies over that
country. Clyde Lewis, who at
one time lived in Austin and was
known here, says the objects are
seen almost daily and sometimes
at night as well as daytime.

The sighting of the so-called
"flying saucers" in Brazil is not
new, Mr. Lewis says. For the
past several years, he has been
hearing reports from other
American residents there of such
sightings. The objects often are
round and disk-shaped, he says, 
and sometimes appear to land.
Just last month, he says, one of
the Brazilian newspapers carried
a report of the possible landing 
of a flying saucer in a rural area.
Some Austin residents who
have returned from Brazil report
similar experiences.

UNBELIEVABLE ALMOST
Dr. Hynek, director of the
Dearborn Observatory at North-
western University, admits
that reports of flying saucers 
over Brazil are "almost unbelieva-
ble." However, he says, similar
sightings have been reported
from other parts of the world,
including the United States.

DR. HYNEK COMMENTS
"There is no doubt," Dr.
Hynek said, "that many of these
sightings represent genuine
phenomena which have not yet
been satisfactorily explained.
That there is a common pattern 
in these sightings around the
world is quite remarkable."

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: June 7 Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My sighting was on May 22, 1965 at approximately 9:30 pm. I was driving alone on Skyline Blvd (a mountain road in central San Mateo County, California) from Pacifica to Woodside. It was a clear, dark night. As I was driving, I noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of me, to the southwest. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was stationary and much brighter than any airplane lights I had ever seen. As I got closer, the object became clearly visible - it appeared to be a large, circular, metallic object, glowing brightly. It was hovering silently, about 500 feet above the road. As I drove nearer, the object began to move slowly to the northeast, maintaining its altitude. I watched it for about 2-3 minutes as it moved across the sky, then it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. After the object disappeared, I continued driving but did not see it again. I was very shaken by the experience, as I had never seen anything like this before. I am a professional person and consider myself to be a rational, level-headed individual. I have no explanation for what I saw that night, other than that it was some kind of unidentified flying object. I reported the sighting to the Air Force, as requested in the questionnaire.

Here is the text output from the document:

The undersigned reports that at 8:20 P.M. August 7, 1965, he observed a strange object that appeared to be stationary in the sky. The object was approximately 1/2 the size of the full moon and had a bright white light around the edge, with a dull center. The object changed from a round to an oval shape while it was observed. It moved across the sky in a slow and direct manner, then stopped and hovered for a few minutes before moving off to the south at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes.

Output of the text from the document:

Light had to be stopped to take a look at the two "lights", could not ascertain from same any size or kind, distant, how long they appeared or disappeared were not known. When they disappeared, same as when they appeared, no unusual loot, just gone after 5 minutes-fair and clear vision. Sounds were all above sounds or objects.

This refers to an observation of two unidentified lights in the sky that appeared and disappeared suddenly, with no unusual sounds or sightings other than the lights themselves. The observer could not determine their size, distance, or duration. The sighting lasted for around 5 minutes under clear conditions.

Transcribing the text:

I have given a good deal of thought to the object which appeared over my home on this date in accordance with the details given about a nine-year-old boy's observation for which I received a report from some reliable source to whom I owe this account over my signature.

A few years ago I became familiar with this fantastic theory. I was impressed, not so much by any case that was impossible to reconcile, but the classic case of an object that could come in with tremendous speed and then halt abruptly and depart with equal velocity seemed to me to establish its quality as a machine of some sort intelligent directed. To have it come in at great speeds close over one's home and then depart in a manner which seemed to indicate an intelligent and purposeful course of action with the object maneuvering and returning in a very short time I found strangely difficult to reconcile my understanding of our present known physical laws.

Certain features such as the manner of its entry, its halt, and its departure I found hard to account for on the basis of anything within my scientific ken. Certain peculiarities of light and color were different and seemed to be different. Certainly beguiling it down to a mere will-o'-the-wisp, or a temporary hallucination, or some transient atmospheric disturbance, I could not quite bring myself to do. Striking as only very rare and impressive phenomena can be, this experience has lingered with me. The peculiarities and novelty of its observed manifestation as a machine force me to conclude that we have here an object and a performance not in keeping with current physical laws and not to be rashly dismissed.

CASE NO. 65-7464900
LOCATION: SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA
DATE: AUGUST 7, 1965

SUMMARY: At approximately 2200 hours on 7 August 1965, the witness observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving slowly. The object was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared from view.

DETAILS: The witness, Mr. John Doe, reported that on the evening of 7 August 1965, at approximately 2200 hours, he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving slowly. The object was first observed over the Hayward area and was tracked visually as it moved in a southwesterly direction. The object was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared from view.

The witness described the object as a single bright light which was brighter than the surrounding stars. He stated that the object appeared to be moving at a slow, constant speed and did not exhibit any sudden maneuvers or changes in direction. The weather at the time of the observation was clear with unlimited visibility.

No other witnesses were reported and no physical evidence was recovered. The case was investigated by the local Air Force base and was categorized as "Unidentified."

CHILE

The flying light again: On August 3, 1965, in the village of Vallenar, Chile, several residents sighted an unusual light phenomenon. According to the reports, a strange appearing luminous object hovered over the center of the village and seemed to flash light intermittently. Many persons in the village gathered and watched this phenomenon for almost an hour. Most people kept a respectful distance, although some brave souls came nearer for a closer view. The object appeared to be surrounded by a luminous haze or field. At times it resembled a bright star, but then suddenly flashed its light in different directions. During the time it was observed, it performed no rapid or erratic maneuvers, but rather just hovered in the sky, emitting flashes of light. When it finally disappeared, the witnesses stated that it had not moved away, but rather that the light just went out and it was gone. There was no sound associated with the object. The villagers, after the encounter, were quite puzzled and disturbed by what they had seen. They had the impression that the object was under intelligent control, but could not understand its purpose in visiting their village. The sighting caused quite a sensation locally and was reported in the newspapers.

LANDINGS IN PERU: Among dozens of important UFO observations in Peru this past summer, one of the most intriguing which have a fair amount of detail in the newspaper accounts that have been sent to us concerns a landing which occurred in a suburb of the capital city of Lima.

The witnesses were three Roman Roman Nunez saw a small device shaped like a barrel that hovered and landed in some brush. As he approached it, he was struck by a beam of light, and lost consciousness. When he recovered, the object had disappeared and he was very ill for a week. As he did so, he was enveloped in an intense red and light which came from the device. When his companion approached the object the following day, he experienced similar effects.

Thereafter, an examination of the scene revealed four circles, each about 9 feet in diameter, which presumably had been made by the landed object. These four circles corresponded to the position of four leg-like appendages which allowed the vessel to land at the bottom of a wood machine.

The image contains a newspaper clipping with the headline "Family Reports Sighting Saucer". The article describes a sighting of a flying saucer in Sydney, Australia, where a family reported seeing a saucer-shaped object with beams of light emanating from it. The object was observed for around 15 minutes before moving off. The incident was reported to have occurred at Goonumbla, New South Wales.

Here is the text from the newspaper clipping:

Family Reports Sighting Saucer
SYDNEY, Australia (Reuters) - A family chorus of howls accompanied the sudden appearance of a flying saucer-shaped object over the family home and brought them rushing out of their residence to see the flying saucer hovering over their home for about 15 minutes before moving off. Two beams of light shone from the top and two from the bottom. It emitted two beams of light. The object remained over the farmyard for about 15 minutes before moving off. Two of the McLinlock boys, 15 and 20, admitted they were terrified before but lost it.
The incident was reported at Goonumbla, New South Wales.

SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED IN MANY AREAS FROM MID-WEST AND WEST AND SOUTH-WEST WHERE THE OBJECTS WERE SAID BY THE AIR FORCE TO BE THE PLANET JUPITER OR SATELLITES OF JUPITER. BUT SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF WITNESSES STATEMENTS SHOWS THE OBJECTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN JUPITER.

ANOTHER LANDING IN CHILE: Again thanks to our South American editor, Mr. Von Hupel, we have another report of a landing in Llanquihue, Chile, and we were witnesses to this again on August 2nd in Llanquihue, Chile. This time the landing was observed by a large group of people, not just a few as in the previous case. The group was seen to be near the UFO when it landed. The witnesses claimed that the craft started to land after a group was seen to take off and by motion that they feinted. Some members fainted but as they did so, they said they saw the craft, but it disappeared when they recovered. Some round charred areas the size of approximately 4-1/2 meters were found around the craft, and it was reported that the ground had been charred and upturned.

Text transcription:

TV Newsman Snaps UFO Photos

On the morning of 5 August 1965, a TV newsman, Charles A. Macomber, was taking pictures of his home in Bells, Texas, near a police broadcasting antenna. His attention was drawn to an unconventional aerial object because of its unusual behavior. He photographed the object for approximately 7 minutes. 

According to the Texas State Police, the only part of the conversation he could monitor was that the object, a blue-white light, was south of Durant, he took his 42 speed Graphic pictures. McCullum, the TV newsman, also gave a slightly different description, stating that the object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, was turning or rotating, and was at an elevation of 45 degrees in the northeast.  The photographs on black and white film show a fairly slow, erratic flight at 3 minute intervals. The object appeared to accelerate and make a very rapid, steep climb.

After watching about 2 1/2 hours, during which the object appeared to hover, the witness, Macomber, left the area, went home and told the story to neighbors, who were also watching the object. Campbell and McCullum were 2 miles west of Bells, Oklahoma, watching from Durant, 30 miles south of Bells, and a Department of Public Safety officer was watching from a point 5 miles south of the location where the object was first sighted.

The interesting point in this sighting is the number of witnesses as well as the duration of the sighting and what the object looked like on film. Campell said the object appeared to be spherical in shape with well-defined edges.

GLOBE - Three bright, blue objects flying at an estimated 5,000 feet altitude were reported over Arizona Monday night, according to reports received here. 
The objects, which were visible for about 15 minutes, were described as being 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and moving at a fast rate of speed. One resident summed up the appearance of the objects as being similar to "three big electric light bulbs."
The objects were reported to be seen by several residents of the Globe-Miami area, but disappeared over the Tonto Basin. No explanation has been made for the sightings, according to the Arizona Republic.

"A comprehensive report dealing with details of a near-mid-air collision over Deep Fork.
"On the morning of Tuesday, August 3, a control tower operator at the Tulsa Municipal Airport reported a near-mid-air collision over the Deep Fork north of Tulsa. He said he witnessed the incident while working the day shift and directed the control of the aircraft involved.
"According to the report, the incident occurred around 7:05 a.m. and involved a civilian aircraft and a military jet. The civilian aircraft, a single-engine Cessna 150, was flown by a student pilot from Spartan School of Aeronautics. The military jet, a supersonic fighter, was on a training mission from Tinker Air Force Base. 
"The tower operator said he first noticed the two aircraft while they were at the 3,000-foot level and approximately 300 yards apart. He said the Cessna was traveling south and the jet was traveling east.
"He said the jet suddenly made a sharp 90-degree turn to the right and headed directly toward the Cessna. The Cessna pilot, seeing the jet approaching, immediately put his aircraft into a steep climb. The jet passed underneath the Cessna with only an estimated 20 to 25 yards of separation, the tower operator reported."

o'clock High—Alan Godfrey, 21, was taking pictures of the strange aerial object when it terminated and arranged in a pattern. The object was then seen for an estimated 45 seconds.

Hayden Hewes, director of the Oklahoma City Ultrasonics section of International Flying Saucer Bureau, said the best explanation he could give was that the object was apparently a vehicle of some kind, possibly an experimental craft from another country.

When they recovered the film and processed it, it was found that it had indeed captured the flying saucer on color film. They had an excellent picture of the object and a relative picture of 3 other lights that were in the area at the time.

SOURCE: Flying Saucer Journal 5 October 1965
1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order Number 66-43 submitted by Major H. Quintandilla, Jr., IDAP/UFO, requesting a photo analysis of an alleged unidentified flying object photographed at Tulsa, Oklahoma on 2 August 1965.
2. ANALYSIS: The following analysis represents a joint effort of the Photo Processing (PP) and Photo Interpretation (PI) Sections of the Exploitation Division of the Directorate of reconnaissance. The analysis indicates the object in the photograph is quite clear, sharply defined, and displays a definite metallic sheen, reflecting light from the sun. The object is estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and to be approximately 500-600 feet in altitude, based upon the apparent size of the object and the topographic features in the background. The object appears to be stationary and exhibiting no visible signs of motion other than occasional wavering of the metallic sheen, possibly caused by atmospheric turbulence. The object casts a distinct shadow on the ground which is clearly visible. The exposure time was approximately 1/500 second at f/11. The object was photographed at 1417 hours local time (CDT) and under the conditions stated in the news article. Range is very undetermined, but could be from a few hundred yards to several miles distance from the camera-lens system. Atmospheric conditions recorded on the film in that atmospheric conditions on the night of 2 August 1965 were described as clear and calm. Some haze may have been present, however, as a fine line caused by a scratch on the film, photo processing personnel noted that the images bear some indication of slight distortion, possibly caused by heat waves or atmospheric turbulence.

His arms extended in embrace, the pontiff bestowed his blessing on the crowd, a scene at once moving and historic.
The appearance of the pontiff brought crowds of an estimated 4 million to the New York metropolitan area Monday to celebrate mass on the spot where Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio once played baseball.
For hours before the papal mass, crowds filled the stadium, some arriving as early as 9 a.m.
More than 90,000 jammed the stadium to see the climax of the Pope's historic visit to the United States, his first ever.
As the Pope arrived, the throng rose with a cry for peace. And, for the moment, the crowds were subdued at the sight of the pontiff, for his solemn benediction.
His white-robed figure with arms extended to embrace the throng in benediction was, in the words of one observer, "the greatest ball game' this stadium has ever seen."
The pontiff had arrived in a white limousine and was greeted by cheers and waving of handkerchiefs of the throng, many Of them children.
The outdoor mass was the climax of a day in which the Pope had traveled to the United Nations, addressed Congress and conducted a mass at the close of the ecumenical council in St. Patrick's Cathedral.
The crowds were still milling in Times Square and in other areas surrounding the Vatican pavilion as late as 11 p.m., some 45 million viewers in homes and behind sets had witnessed the events of a day standing in an open car.
But the throng in Yankee Stadium, estimated at over 90,000, gave the Pope a tumultuous ovation as he appeared on the platform and bestowed his blessing on the vast throng.

First Night Color Shot 
Of Flying Saucer Bared
Copyright 1965 by The
Edgewood Publishing Co.
Augusta, Georgia
On August 3, 1945, Alan Smith, 19, of Edgewood a suburb of
San Antonio, Texas, claims he saw a mysterious light in the
darkened sky and clicked the shutter of his camera.
The negative he recovered show, in color, what he claims to be
the first night color shot of a flying saucer.
Smith was one of a group of unidentified persons who reportedly
saw the object on that date. The Air Force has not commented on
this case.
The Air Force on August 1 and this flight were pressed, did not
believe it to be the first night color photograph of flying
saucers previously recorded, since it has been determined from
the one-in-a-million possibility of the incident being real.
The negative shows a yellowish, blue, and white disk-shaped
object with a dark area in the middle, believed to be the
turbine engine. From the object are three tiny lights in a
triangular formation, which are believed to be the multi-
colored running lights system. They could have been lighting
system for landing or takeoff purposes, it is believed.
The same type of phenomenon was reported to have been
sighted in Tulsa, Oklahoma, December and other places in the
southwest, and similar craft were explained away by the Air
Force as being aircraft or weather balloons.
