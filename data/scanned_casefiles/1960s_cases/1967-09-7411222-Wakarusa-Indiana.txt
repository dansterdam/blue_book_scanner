TDEV/UO (3) Calumet ill /7096/mh/5 Oct 67

UFO Observer, September 1967

OCT 6 1967

1. Reference your recent letter of September 10, 1967 in which you reported an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

2. Because of the large number of objects that orbit the earth, an exact identification of the satellite that you could be difficult. (See enclosed sheet). However, we feel that you probably observed the Pegosa satellite which was launched by the United States in 1965. On September 7, at 9:23 PM it was at 69° longitude and 40° latitude, or nearly overhead in your location. At 9:51 pm it was at 75° longitude, 30° latitude, and should have still been in sight. Those traces have been visible in the northern sky between 9:30 and 10:00 at a height of approximately 3600 miles and heading in a northerly direction.

3. Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.

JAMES C. MALLEY, Colonel, USAF
Director, Astronautics and Subsystems
