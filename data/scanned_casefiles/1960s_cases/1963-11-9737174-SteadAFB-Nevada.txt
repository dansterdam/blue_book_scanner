SAUCER NEWS, VOL IX, MAR 64                                                14 NOVEMBER 63
                                                                            CARSON CITY, NEVADA

ELECTROMAGNETIC SAUCER IN NEVADA: A sighting which gives further confirmation to John J. Robinson's article in this issue of SAUCER NEWS occurred on November 14th in Carson City, Nevada. A resident of Carson City named Blanche Pritchett reported early that morning that she saw a disc-shaped object. Premonitions in size, it was hovering in the southwest skies. The lady described it as a brilliant start of light from the UFO illuminated a nearby hill.

The huge object stood stationary in space while she watched it from a window of her home. It had "an odd green color with a golden cast," and was obviously not a conventional aircraft. First noticed the UFO at about 4:45 a.m. after seeing the drapes of her bedroom lift slightly. She added that a radio station which she was listening to at this time went off the air while the object was listening. The object then back on again after the UFO disappeared.

Other persons phoned police, the weatherman, and a radio station in nearby Reno and reported the same or a similar object in the sky southeast of Reno. No explanation for the phenomenon could be found.
