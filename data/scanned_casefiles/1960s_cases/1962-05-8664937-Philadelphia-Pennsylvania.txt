as in an odd-looking craft. The craft
is on the paper and I can
mainishly see it when I told
of the guard or (??) any
one - I deliver and a friend
of mine on the Base. But it
would be an idea to take
a straight picture of the craft
in case it appears again. I
have seen them often
believe, they are extra

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

T'lere is nothing more that can i.je written about this
case. The report appears to be complete and the
information given is as much as the observer could
furnish.

The observer states that he was driving home from
work, looking out of the car window, when he noticed
an object in the sky. His attention was attracted to it
because it was not moving, but appeared to be suspended
in the sky. He observed it for about 5 minutes and then
it moved rapidly away from him.

The object was round in shape, appeared to be silvery
in color and gave off a bright glow. It was larger than
a star or planet and somewhat smaller than the full
moon. The observer states that he has never seen anything
like it before and does not know what it was.
