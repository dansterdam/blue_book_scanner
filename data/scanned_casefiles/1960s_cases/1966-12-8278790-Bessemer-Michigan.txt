Officer In Charge;

On clear nights in the months
of October and November, I observed an object while searching for various constellations.
The object is in the North,
North-eastern sky, and is 45°
above the level of ground
and moves slowly south.
Would you give me any
information, pamphlets or
otherwise, on it, or on unidentified flying objects.
Any information you give
me will take to my
eighth grade science class.

Thank - you
