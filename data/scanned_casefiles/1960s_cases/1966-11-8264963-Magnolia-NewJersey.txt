The brightness was compared to a car headlight, about six blocks away. One observer said that it was nothing more than a car light. At another time a son who reported the sighting.

The time duration of the sighting is different in the two facts shown. One said over one hour, in another for about 15 minutes. Also there is some discrepancy in the time making it difficult to determine the exact time of the sighting.
