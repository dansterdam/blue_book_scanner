Sighting characteristic of an astro body with the exception of the degrees of arc through which the obj moved, since the obj was observed in two successive nights in the same place this motion is greatly distorted in this report. "Obj is high in the PM. Data would not permit for the initial report of the object in the East. The distance INRARLY saw a star but the exact object cannot be determined from the data presented.
