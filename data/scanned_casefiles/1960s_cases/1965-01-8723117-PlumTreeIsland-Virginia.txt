h. Unusual meteorological activity or conditions: None.

i. Interceptive action taken: None - due to the object's disappearance before its reported to the Air Force. However, the area was searched by the investigator in a helicopter the next morning after the reported sighting. Nothing unusual was found.

j. Air traffic in the area: Navy Norfolk reported than an H-3 (Navy Helicopter 49921) was in the area east of Langley AFB between 2300 and 2330 Zulu, 27 January 1965.

k. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dockum, USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing (DOQ-H), Langley AFB, Virginia. The description of this UFO sighting was given by Mr. [redacted] Lt. Dockum during a personal interview on 29 January 1965. Mr. [redacted] said that there were other reports of similar sightings in the same area and at the approximate same time. These others were given to the press, but not to the Air Force. The most probable cause of this sighting was a helicopter flying in the area. This possibility was confirmed by Navy Norfolk ("j" above).

1. No physical evidence was reported to exist.

2. Mr. [redacted] was prompted to report his sighting by the many other reports in the Virginia coastal area. Many of these reports are widely publicized by the press, but never are turned over to the Air Force. Mr. [redacted] stated he thought a helicopter would explain his sighting.
