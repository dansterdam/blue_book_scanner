Here is the text from the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THESE POINTS. SHOW THE MOVEMENT WITH AN ARROW POINTING FROM "X" TO "B"
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR S-LIKE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE

Allentown, Penna.
May 6, 1969

Gentlemen,
Please do not think me a nut or a lunatic for writing this letter. I am 11 years old and my name is Michael Tedesco. For two years now I have been interested in UFOs, aerial phenomena, flying saucers, or whatever you want to call it. On Sunday, May 4, 1969 my sister and I witnessed a strange sighting. We were playing shadow-tag in Feinberg's Parking Lot (See diagram A). It was a clear night. Since I am partly interested in astronomy, I kept looking up at the stars. While coming up from the light at the end of the lot I came to a tree. Once again I took a glance in the sky—Before I go on, I'll give you a background of what you should know.


- page 10 -

My sister's name is [redacted]. Her nick-name is [redacted] yard pictured is where the tree is that we saw the UFO above. The yard had two dogs in it. The dogs were always barking at us.

Now — I looked up and there it was. It looked like a meteor. Only, it had a red capsule, possibly the UFO itself with a tail. It had three red lights right behind the capsule. The rest was yellow, like a meteor tail. My first [redacted] reaction was, "Oh, my God, PD-LOOK!" She looked up in time to see it, though it was traveling fast. Then an odd thing happened. As soon as I pointed to it, the dogs stopped barking. Then the lights went out — in sequence. Soon it disappeared from sight. (UFO in diagram [symbol]). I thought might it was a meteor, then I thought about the lights. Then, it thought it was like somebody threw up in the air. I took a flashlight and went looking for anything. I found nothing. It was 10:00 P.M. so


- page 11 -

I went in the house. I told my other sister about what happened. She said, "Maybe there were some aliens in it. They might have seen me pointing and turned out their lights." The next day I looked in the newspaper for any reports on meteors. Now. it is 10:20 P.M. May 6, 1969. I am still thinking about the UFO. PLEASE file this in your files as a UFO report. If I see anymore UFO's you'll be the first to know. Thanks for your time.

UFO Watcher,

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

19 MAY 69

This replies to your letter of May 6, 1969, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we could not attempt to tell you what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book we are including.

Sincerely,

/s/
JAMES H. ATKINS
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
