PART ELEVEN. R. 1SGT M. LEIBERMAN, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 
99 BOMB WING (SAC). AT FIRST ANALYSIS, THE DESCRIPTION SEEMS 
TO FIT A JET USING AN AFTERBURNER. HOWEVER, A CHECK OF ALL LOCAL 
FIGHTER UNITS IN THE VICINITY INDICATES THAT NO SUCH AIRCRAFT 
WERE AIRBORNE AT THE TIME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A FIGHTER FROM 
AN AIRFIELD OUTSIDE THE LOCAL AREA WAS OPERATION HERE, HOWEVER, 
THE CLOUD COVER WOULD INDICATE THAT HE WAS VERY LOW AND THIS 
WOULD NOT BE A NORMAL ACTIVITY FOR THIS TIME OF NIGHT. PART 
TWELVE. L. NONE.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round, white-to-amber obj viewed fm dark to daylight observed at 30 dgr elevation moving to 90 dgr & becoming stationary. Rpt fm civilian caused witness to look out window & observe obj.

11. COMMENTS
Initial sighting of star at 30 dgr. Star Betelgeuse. Rigel is on horizon at this time. Pollux at 55 dgr elevation & all have az of about 260 dgr. At 20 dgr ele. Regulus 260 dgr. At 70 dgr ele. to the South. It is the only 1st mag obj at the coming of daylight that would appear to be overhead. Case listed as mi misinterpretation of astro-bodies. Rising attributes to refraction of Rigel & transference of identification to Regulus or other star.
