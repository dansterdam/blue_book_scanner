Dear [redacted]

The Office of the President has asked the Air Force to reply to your letter concerning the Unidentified Flying Objects you have sighted on October 23, 1963.

We are enclosing two Forms FTD 184 which we would like to have you fill out and return to this office. These forms will give us a clearer idea of the description of the objects you saw, their location in the sky, and any details of the "weather", all of which are important in making an investigation.

In the reports, be sure to make the location of the crane and the church and how far the objects were from where you were standing.

Enclosed also is a self-addressed envelope for your use in returning the forms to this office.

Sincerely,
