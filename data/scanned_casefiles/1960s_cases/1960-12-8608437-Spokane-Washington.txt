No Case (Information Only)                                   2-12 December 1960
                                                                       Atlantic City, New Jersey

On December 2-12 the Atlantic City Press reported that several UFOs were sighted in southern New Jersey. In one case listed by the Press, a strange flying object which descended to about 350 feet was reported by a duck hunter. When he raised his shotgun, the hunter said, the UFO rose vertically and disappeared.

NEW JERSEY HUNTER ALMOST SHOOTS SAUCER! Last December 3rd, a duck hunter named [redacted] and his grandson had a frightening experience with a UFO in the meadows near Atlantic City, N. J. In his own words, two men spotted the object flying straight at them, about 300 feet above the ground, and when it came close, it seemed to be about 50 feet in diameter.

It then rose vertically into the air and flew away. The strange machine was saucer-shaped and measured about 50 feet. In Atlantic City, it was colored a pale green and then changed to purple as the machine seemed to bounce in the air. The UFO traveled silently at all times, and moved with a jerky motion "like a bouncing ball," according to the two.

On December 3, 1960 Duck Hunter [redacted], 65, near Atlantic City, New Jersey disclosed his story of a recent encounter with a big disc, as he prepared to fight off a spacecraft from another planet--with a shotgun. While on a hunting trip with his grandson at 6 A.M. they saw an object flying at them, over the meadows at about 300 feet above the ground.

"Golly, that's coming right straight towards us," cried the boy, slipped shells into his shotgun and replied, "Don't worry if it comes at us, I'll shoot it." As it reached them, it rose vertically up in the air. According to [redacted] the disc measured about 60 feet in diameter, had a red glow that lit up the group and that changed to purple as it rose vertically.

It came out of the east, then turned southwest. The disc traveled silently and moved with a jerky action like a bouncing ball in the air. The elusive "saucer" got away, but you'd have a hard time telling these people that it weren't there in the first place.

A report from Portland, Connecticut, dated December 14th states that Mr. and Mrs. [illegible text] of that city witnessed a flying saucer at about 10 p.m. on the previous night. The object was making erratic movements in the sky, and looked like a silver-white object at times. A conical form was also noted. Strange metallic-like details appeared to be on the object, which was about 20 degrees above the two varied in color. Watching like a jellyfish. The thing was in view for 20 minutes.

No Case (Information Only)                                   2-12 December 1960
                                                                       Atlantic City, New Jersey

On December 2-12 the Atlantic City Press reported that several UFOs were sighted in southern New Jersey. In one case listed by the Press, a strange flying object which descended to about 350 feet was reported by a duck hunter. When he raised his shotgun, the hunter said, the UFO rose vertically and disappeared.

NEW JERSEY HUNTER ALMOST SHOOTS SAUCER! Last December 3rd, a duck hunter named [redacted] and his grandson had a frightening experience with a UFO in the meadows near Atlantic City, N. J. In his own words, two men spotted the object flying straight at them, about 300 feet above the ground, and when it came close, it seemed to be about 50 feet in diameter.

It then rose vertically into the air and flew away. The strange machine was saucer-shaped and measured about 50 feet. In Atlantic City, it was purple in the meadows and seemed to be close to the air. The UFO traveled silently at all times, and moved with a jerky motion "like a bouncing ball," according to the two.

On December 3, 1960 Duck Hunter [redacted], 65, near Atlantic City, New Jersey disclosed his story of a recent encounter with a big disc, as he prepared to fight off a spacecraft from another planet--with a shotgun. While on a hunting trip with his grandson at 6 A.M. they saw an object flying at them, over the meadows at about 300 feet above the ground.

"Golly, that's coming right straight towards us," cried the boy, slipped shells into his shotgun and replied, "Don't worry if it comes at us, I'll shoot it." As it reached them, it rose vertically up in the air. According to [redacted] the disc measured about 60 feet in diameter, had a red glow that lit up the group and that changed to purple as it rose vertically.

It came out of the east, then turned southwest. The disc traveled silently and moved with a jerky action like a bouncing ball in the air. The elusive "saucer" got away, but you'd have a hard time telling these people that it weren't there in the first place.
