(3) Ceiling: Clear.
(4) Visibility: Unlimited.
(5) Cloud Cover: None.
(6) Thunderstorms: None.

(7) Vertical Temperature Gradient: An inversion was reported between 1600 Feet and 1850 Feet. The following temperatures were reported by the Fleet Weather Facility:

900 Feet:   +2.1°C
1600 Feet:  +0.5°C
1850 Feet:  +3.6°C
3000 Feet:  +0.3°C
7500 Feet:  -3.0°C
10000 Feet: -5.0°C

These temperatures were taken by the Norfolk Weather Bureau at 1200 Zulu (0700 local) 1 January 1965.

h. A check was made by the Oceana Naval Air Station Public Information Office of all local radar sites in the Norfolk area. No unusual activity was reported. The Navy Norfolk Weather Service reported the only meteorological condition which might account for the sighting. This condition was the inversion described in g(7) above.

i. No interception action was taken due to a one-day time lag before the observer reported his sighting to the Navy.

j. The FAA Norfolk Approach Control reported that there was no air traffic under their control from 0600 to 100 Zulu on 1 January 1965.

k. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dockum, USAF, 1605 Air Base Wing (DOQ-HQ), Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The description of this UFO sighting was given by Patrolman Diehl to Lieutenant Dockum during a personal interview on 8 January 1965. No other reports of a similar sighting were found. A possible cause of the reported objects in ground lights reflecting off the weather inversion. This probability was confirmed by the duty forecasters at the Norfolk Fleet Weather Facility, the Langley Base Weather Facility, the Patuxent River Naval Weather Facility, and the Norfolk Weather Bureau.
