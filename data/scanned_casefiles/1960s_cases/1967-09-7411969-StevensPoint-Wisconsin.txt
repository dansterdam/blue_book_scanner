1. Reference your letter of September 13, 1967 in which you submitted an unidentified specimen. The sample that you sent to the Aerial Phenomena Branch has been identified as a radar chaff. This material is dropped in military exercises to confuse radar. Stevens Point UWA is an authorized chaff drop point for Truax Field and has been used frequently for this purpose.

2. We are returning your sample and also have included a copy of Project Blue Book which you may find interesting.

Sir:

Enclosed you will find samples of what appears to be bits of aluminum.
It was found in a neighbor's field. This neighbor says that he thinks
it fell from the sky. Why he thinks this, I don't know.

There was just one small clump of the material in the field. What you
hold now is just a sample. Perhaps it is just some ordinary substance,
and then again, maybe it comes from some strange place. Anyway, I'm
sending it to you to examine closely.

I would appreciate it if you could tell me what the substance is. Also,
could you please send me as much information as possible, concerning
UFO's.

If you are unable to tell me what the substance is, its OK. The
important thing is that you have the substance to examine.

I would appreciate any information you can offer.

Sincerely yours,
Thomas Maslowski
