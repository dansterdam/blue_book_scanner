Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

I am writing this letter for two reasons, to give and to receive information. I would like to report on an event of a week or so ago, and also to inquire about the investigations that you are making or have made in Wayne County Illinois.

I was driving south on Route 185, 2 miles Northwest of St. Peter, Illinois. At approximately 1:20 AM, Saturday November 2, 1963 A.D., through my windshield, I observed an object fall from the sky. I noted that it did NOT have a tail, so I dismissed natural falling object. It had a yellow-orange dull non-glittering glow that progressively got brighter as it approached the ground. As this moment last gild sister of yellowish-white and first appeared in a horizontal plane, slightly about 3 seconds or so. It then assumed the characteristics of a plane, slightly inclined, and a focused observation led to a free-fall. Since the road is quite curved at that point, and the campus in my car is unreal 1.5 miles exactly what direction it came from, except that it would be from 149 NW to 150 SE. Going through my mind, except that it would be more of an opinion, would say the object obtained its characteristic glow from organic compounds, other than our present limited knowledge of organic compounds and their characteristics.

So much for my observation. Now I would like to know some things about the August 14, 1953, sighting in the Fairfield area. Its most points of the investigation because of its characteristic and pattern are a because I have most of the other information. I know that what I am doing. (However, you seem to have done much a good job of checking. I find it useless even to attempt to talk CP information then him.) Therefore, I am turning to you.

He stated, "I had my radio tuned on WLS...when that thing crossed over my car the radio went crazy...it made all kinds of sounds, and I did these sounds to be so compared to be. For example an electric will to his girl? (or were they later more of an interlocution with other radio stations) Did either Mr. or his civil have any other effects such as guiding instinct for a day or so afterwards?

Finally, I would like to ask about the object turned over to
Flaming Officer William McPherson on or about October 31, 1963:

a) What does the object appear to be of now?
b) What does the object appear to have been made of before recently?
c) Have you bisected the object?
d) What was the interior made of?
e) Was any gold present?
f) Were there any remains of resinous compounds inside?
g) Were any calcium anhydrous silicon compounds present?
h) What is its specific gravity?
i) Does it have any characteristic symmetrical markings and/or
and there any form of patterns on the exterior or in the interior layers?
j) If so, what is this pattern (graphically illustrated)?
k) You found more radioactive count on the exterior than the
interior, right?

This paragraph is my standard "form" paragraph I always insert
when writing to government agencies of the earth.
Your help is appreciated. Since I do pay my "fair share" and
since I see nothing in any of my questionnaires that would seriously
"endanger the safety and security of the United States," I will
answer as fully and with as few as possible of 1) unconstitutional
statements 2) militaristic conclusions 3) press release form letters
of an official nature, and 4) letters geared toward security clearance
publicity directives. If however, you feel that this material should
not be spread around, mainly I suppose to protect from civil disorder
of typically psychotic citizenry, I'll be happy to guarantee your
confidance.

My sincere thanks for being of assistance to me. (I-H O P E)

Very truly,

Decatur, Illinois 6 25 23

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDBW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information                                                   2 DEC 1963

TO: HQ USAF SAF-OIPE (Mrs Gaiser)
WASH 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted] dated
16 Nov 63, requesting information on unidentified flying objects.

2. [Redacted] sighting was undoubtedly a meteor. The meteors
with tails are full common. Also, the colors are consistent
with a meteor sighting as is the duration of three seconds. Satel-
lite decays are ruled out for the following obvious reasons:

    a. All satellite decays have an Easterly component, i.e.,
    Northeast or Southeast.

    b. Decay is characteristic of a breaking up of the object
    and colors tend to be red or orange.

    c. The duration is much greater than a meteor sighting, for
    example Sputnik IV lasted in excess of two minutes. The decay
    of 1960 was observed from Florida to Maine and lasted in
    excess of four minutes.

3. A case summary of the 4 Aug 1963 sighting in Fairfield, Illinois
is attached. It should answer most of the questions raised by Mr
[redacted]

    a. At no time did the Air Force attempt to convince Mr [redacted]
    that he had an overactive imagination. In fact, he was not informed
    of our evaluation of the sighting. However, it is difficult to ex-
    plain how Mr [redacted] was able to observe certain events and/or objects
    while his passenger, Miss [redacted] did not see them.

    b. There are many reasons for static on a car radio, for example,
    aircraft flying overhead or driving under or parallel to electric power
    lines. No association was established between the UFO and static in
    the radio.

    c. The Air Force has no information regarding a "guiding instinct"
    in relation to this case.

4. The object, found in the creek bed by [redacted] was turned over to the officials from Scott AFB. At this time it was determined that it was not radioactive. Specific answers to questions in paragraph 4 of his letter are as follows:

a. The object is a rock.
b. It has never been in outer space.
c. Yes, we have bisected the object.
d. The interior is made of silicon compounds.
e. No gold was present.
f. There were no remains of resinous compounds inside.
g. Yes, there were calcium and silicon compounds present.
h. No test was made to determine its specific gravity.
i. The exterior layer is iron pyrite, the interior or center is composed of CAO3 + 27 Si.
j. No answer.
k. The object was not radioactive.

5. Nothing in this letter is considered classified.

Case Jan. 1963
St. Peter, Vermont

December 6, 1963

Dear Mr.

Referring to your letter of November 15, 1963, and in particular to your plea for brevity, here we submit the following information:

Your sighting was undoubtedly a meteor. Meteors without tails are quite common. Also, there colors are consistent with a meteor sighting as is the duration of the three seconds. Satellites are ruled out for the following obvious reasons:

a. All satellite decays have an easterly component, i.e., northeast or southeast;

b. Decay is characterized by a breaking up of the object and colors tend to be red or orange;

c. Duration of satellite decay is much greater than meteor sighting. For example, Sputnik IV lasted in excess of two minutes. The Frogs decay of 1960 was observed from Florida to Maine and lasted in excess of four minutes.

A case summary of the August 4, 1963 sighting at Fairfield, Ill. is attached. Mr. at no time did Air Force attempt to convince Mr. of the facts, that he had an overactive imagination. In fact, he was not informed of our evaluation of the sighting. However, it is difficult to explain now. Mr. was able to observe certain events and/or objects while his passengers, Miss __, did not see same.

There are many reasons for static on a car radio. For example, aircraft flying overhead on parallel course, electric power lines are two causes. No association was made between the UFO and static in the radio.

The Air Force has no information regarding a "gliding inside" in relation to this case.

The object found in the creek bed by Mr. [redacted] was turned over to the officials from Scott Air Force Base. At this time it was determined that it was not radioactive. Specific answers to questions in paragraph 4 of your letter are as follows:

a. The object is a rock.
b. It has never been in outer space.
c. Yes, we have bisected the object.
d. The interior is made of silicon compounds.
e. No gold was present.
f. There were no remains of resinous compounds inside.
g. Yes, there were calcium and silicon compounds present.
h. No test was made to determine its specific gravity.
i. The exterior layer is iron pyrite, the interior or center is composed of CaCO3 + 2% Fe.
j. No answer.
k. The object was not radioactive.

Nothing in this letter is considered classified.
