e. Disappearance of Object.
(1) Observation was discontinued when vision was blocked by a tree.

f. Duration of observation was estimated by the observer to be at least ten minutes but not more than twenty minutes. No elapsed time check was made.

3. Manner of Observation
a. The observer first sighted the object by naked eye (with normal glasses being worn) and then observed it with binoculars. The investigating officer examined then and estimated the following capability. Objects could be observed with sharp detail with a magnification of three times linear definition. The binoculars appeared to be relatively inexpensive and no name or identification existed on the instrument itself.

b. The angles of elevations and bearings were determined by the investigating officer as follows:

(1) The angle of elevation was determined by the observer sighting down the straight edge of an aircraft navigation plotter type B-2A USAF Stock No. 5C17-AAA-5A at 20 points at which the observer made sightings which were reference very closely to physical features on the ground such as telephone poles and trees. Vertical reference was established by a plumb bob on a tripod through the hole in the plotter.

(2) The bearings were established on a map of the city of Richmond (scale 1 inch equals 2,000 feet) by orienting it and sighting to the observers remembered points of observation. A pocket compass was utilized in a sliding manner and corrected for local magnetic variation. These two values were then averaged. The average difference between the bearings taken by the two methods calculated was 9 1/2 degrees.

(3) The tolerances given in the elevations and bearings of sightings apply only to the observers described points of sightings and are not intended to imply the observers accuracy of memory.

4. Time and Date of Sighting

CRUISING ALTITUDES - FLIGHT LEVELS

The following procedures apply to the operation of aircraft within the United States, excluding the Aleutian Islands west of 180°W and the State of Hawaii. They are also applicable within the airspace between the Continental United States and the adjacent ICAO Flight Information Regions (FIRs).

ALTIMETER SETTING
(a) At or below 24,500 feet MSL, to the current altimeter setting reported by a station which is within 100 nautical miles, if possible. The altimeter of an aircraft without radio shall be set to the elevation of the airport of departure or to an appropriate available setting. Vertical displacement shall be determined by reference to Cruising Altitudes and are expressed in feet above mean sea level.

(b) When an aircraft is operating on a standard setting (29.92"), Vertical displacements determined by that setting are from Flight Levels and are expressed in 3-digit figures; for example, Flight Level 250 represents an altitude of 25,000 feet. When an aircraft is operating on other than standard setting, the altimeter reading will be a figure which is numerically greater than 240. For example, in flying from TO-FROM a cruising altitude of 5,000 feet will be indicated as 5,500 feet. The lowest usable Flight Level, however, may be a figure which is numerically greater than 250. For example, an aircraft at Flight Level 250 will be at an actual height of 24,000 feet MSL, and therefore, will be at the lowest usable Flight Level.

DIRECTION OF FLIGHT
When an aircraft is operated in level flight, the following Cruising Altitudes or Flight Levels, whichever is appropriate, shall be observed in accordance with the magnetic course being flown:

(a) Under Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
At or feet or more above the surface

Below 29,000 feet
[Circular diagrams showing Even and Odd Thousands flight levels and their corresponding altitudes]

Above 29,000 feet
[Circular diagrams showing Flight Levels 320 and 300 intervals]

(b) Under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
When Controlled Airspace is authorized by an air traffic control facility, except that aircraft operating "on top" in the absence of an authorized specific altitude shall be flown as specified above for Visual Flight Rules.

Outside Controlled Airspace

Below 29,000 feet and Above 29,000 feet
[Circular diagrams showing flight level intervals for different altitude ranges]

Within ICAO Flight Information Regions (FIRs), including the Aleutian Islands west of 180°W, the State of Hawaii and the United States Possessions and Territories, Cruising Altitudes and Flight Levels shall be determined in compliance with the ICAO Regional Supplementary Procedures.

V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)

The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 108-118 megacycles band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and man-made static and interference from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as in the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course, to or from the station, the pilot may select. That is only is is called the VHF OMNIDIRECTIONAL RANGE (VOR).

A minimum instrument altitude (54 nautical miles), depending on enroute terrain.

The first is the flight Path Deviation Indicator (course deviation indicator), which is the basic instrument. The vertical needle indicates the pilot's position relative to the VOR station, by the rotation of a small knob, by which the pilot can determine his position. The second is an Omni-bearing Selector, manually operated by the pilot to select the course he wishes to fly. The third is a "TO-FROM" indicator which tells the pilot whether the magnetic bearing of the aircraft either to or from the station. The third is a "TO-"PROM" indicator which tells the pilot when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal.

In operation, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then maintains the heading with the "TO-FROM" indication. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the TO-FROM indication, then the needle swings to the right. For example, it indicates that the course selected is to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to indicate "TO".

The "TO-FROM" indicator will point to the word "FROM" if a turn of 180° is made south of the station, although the vertical needle will remain on the same side of center. If the pilot now turns 180°, the "TO-FROM" indicator will still point to "FROM". This shows him that the "TO-FROM" indicator is incorrect. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to "FROM". After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator lifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES

[Table shows reception distances for various altitudes from 500 to 20,000 feet]

Note: "No physical obstruction intervening. *Based on zero elevation of the facility. (Distances to nearest even 5 miles). If you are using a VHF transmitter, remember that its effective range increases with your altitude. Don't attempt to contact a station unless you are within "line of sight"."

U.S. WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS

All continuously operated FAA radio ranges, both Low Frequency and VOR, and radio beacon stations having voice facilities on the airways will rebroadcast weather reports. The 15-minute past-the-hour broadcast is an "area" broadcast consisting of weather reports from locations within approximately 150 statute miles of the broadcasting station. The 45-minute past-the-hour broadcast is a "broad-cast consisting of weather reports from important terminals located on airways within approximately 400 statute miles of the station.

FLIGHT PLAN

The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a VFR Flight plan be filed except as specified for flight in air defense identification zones. However, the FAA urges that VFR flight plans be filed whenever practical to facilitate search and rescue operations when such action becomes necessary. Flight plans should be submitted to the nearest Flight Service Station (FSS) in person or by telephone. They may be filed by radio if no other means are available, but this practice should be avoided whenever possible in order to reduce congestion of radio channels.

The pilot should always state the name of the FAA Flight Service Station with which he intends to close his flight plan. If the destination is not served by a FAA station or is in Canada or Mexico the method by which the arrival report will be filed must be clearly understood by all concerned.

VFR flight plans are transmitted only to the FAA station with which the pilot has stated his arrival report will be filed. If the flight plan is not closed within one hour after the estimated time of arrival, queries are sent to determine the location of the aircraft. Should the aircraft not be located after an exhaustive inquiry, search and rescue operations are inaugurated.

When a flight is terminated prior to reaching the intended destination specified in the flight plan, pilots should contact the nearest FAA station and request that an arrival report be transmitted to the FAA station of intended destination. The importance of closing the flight plan cannot be overemphasized.

Pilots of aircraft operating on VFR flight plan who desire to make flight progress reports, should include in the report the phrase: "VFR FLIGHT PLAN (blank) TO (blank)," along with identification, position, time and altitude.

The flight plan should always specify "VFR" as a cruising altitude. The use of this term in lieu of an actual altitude indicates that the pilot intends to fly in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. Aircraft may be operated in accordance with VFR above a well defined cloud or other formation provided slime to and identification from such "on top" flight can also be made in accordance with VFR.

A DVFR (Defense Visual Flight Rules) flight plan is mandatory for VFR flight within an ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone) at a speed greater than 150 knots or an altitude over 3000 feet above the immediate terrain; except that flights in certain direction from a Defense Area, as specified in Part 520, Regulations of the Administrator, are exempted from this requirement.

For IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) the pilot is required to have an instrument rating and the aircraft must be properly equipped. The latter includes a properly functioning two-way radio. For details see Part 40 of the Civil Air Regulations.

Prior to departure from within, or prior to entering a control area or control zone, a pilot must submit a complete VFR flight plan and receive an air traffic clearance. Refer to Flight Information Manual published by the Federal Aviation Agency for further information.

ASTRONOMY
Venus, Jupiter and Saturn Shine
During June, Venus shines brilliantly in the west during twilight. Two other planets, Jupiter and Saturn, appear in the east later in the evening, James Stokley reports.

WITH THE COMING of June, the planet Venus clearly is in the west in the sky during the early evening, while two other planets, Jupiter and Saturn, appear in the east later in the evening. For the first half of this early summer sky, Venus is chiefly in the Northern Hemisphere on the evening side.

Venus, moving rapidly through the sky, is positioned both early in the month and at the end. Both early and late in June, Venus will be a brilliant evening star. We observe Venus in the constellation of Gemini, the twins, near the bright star Pollux. Soon after this Venus moves into the Lion constellation (Cancer), the crab.

On June 30 it will be close to the sixth magnitude star Leo 1, Virginis, that implements.

Venus and part of the circle are shown on our map of the northern sky, but most of Leo is on one of the southern part of the map. Venus is now moving in the constellation Virgo, which marks the end of the sixth month. Figure and further details are in Deutsch.

Above it, in Bootes, the Booteans. In Arcturus, a very brilliant star, is very low to the east, by the way, is to look first to the north and find the big dipper. The dipper is now standing upright, the bottom of the dipper is now standing to the right, looking toward Polaris.

High in the east stands Vega, in Lyra, the lyre. This is the brightest of the stars near which, though it is about a twenty-fifth magnitude star, is the first of the brilliant of Jupiter. Beneath Vega lies Cygnus, the swan, and north of the northern cross. It is now seen partly inverted for Draco, to the left, is at the top of the cross.

In the right of Cygnus (close on the border of Ursa Minor) is the bright star Deneb, and in this group stands the star called Albireo. You may notice, by the way, that this star is shown by the second magnitude.

The same is true for Antares, Regulus, Deneb.

Turning to Ophiuchus, the constellation of these stars is greatly attractive. Though the stars are low in the earth's atmosphere; when seen high in the sky, their appearance is much better. Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, shown low in the month, is so near the horizon that it is at the end of the field.

The constellations is an old case; it has been traced back as far as 1204 B.C. In Greek mythology it represents Aesculapius, the god of healing. Apollo and the first physician were able to restore the dead to life.

Stars of Ophiuchus

At present Ophiuchus contains no star as bright as the first magnitude, but in the year 1604 there flashed out within its borders one that for a time rivalled Venus in brilliance. The great German astronomer Kepler discovered it extensively and wrote about it. Its location is a little below the point where the serpent's tail joins Ophiuchus.

This was a fine example of a supernova, a star whose reason not fully understood, suddenly explodes. One may recall that it became as much as a hundred million times brighter than the sun (in visual luminosity, or candlepower). Kepler's supernova was the last to appear in our Milky Way system—the galaxy-lost nova. It was observed in 1604 and has been studied in detail by astronomers that was observed in 1572 and 1604. These were in the years 1572, 1604. There are Chinese records of its appearance, and its location is marked now by a cloud of glowing gases called the Crab nebula. Nothing remains visible of the original star.

(1) The investigating officer considered the sincere and consistent in his report and based on his interview, that lasted approximately an hour and a half, found no reason to believe that the information he gave was other than what he observed. Locally reported weather observations possibly conflict with the report. On the other conditions as described were not impossible. A check with the employer of the observer, further indicated the observer has no reputation of exaggeration.

7. Weather and Winds
a. The observer definitely stated that he saw no clouds or obstruction to vision. The local weather bureau observed extensive sky coverage at this time. This makes the observer's weather statement questionable, but due to the fluctuating sky coverage, proximity of weather station to the UFO observer (the weather station is for nautical miles on a true bearing of 120 degrees from the UFO observer), and the relatively small area of sky involved with the sightings, weather conditions could have permitted the sightings.

b. Winds: Surface wind at time of observation was NE at 6 knots at Byrd Field (Richmond Airport). See attachment 3. The most applicable winds also locally available are all for 0600, 0900 EDT, and 0100 EST for 1 mile 50.

According to a story published by WBAB*, Bensle affiliates, a woman living in Bordentown Township, N.J., saw a weird light at close range on the night of June 1st. The woman, Mrs. Blanche Wild, said that whatever the object was, it was moving, and the most eerie part was its yard-to-yard movement. She could not explain the light, which could be seen from branch to branch of nearby trees and finally hovered away into the sky.

LOCAL SIGHTING -
Cuyahoga Falls, O. 6/18/52
930 PM an UFO was a
for two minutes in the clear
sky by a driver going west
on Falls Ave. He stopped to
observe a cigarette-shaped,
bluish-green, sharply de-
fined object that held round-
ed or blunted nose. The vi-
sion said it was luminous and
somewhat transparent. As the
back of the object, there
seemed to be a short, ra-
dian flare or glow following
its short distance near
a bright, white star - like
object. The UFO was moving
at a very low altitude from
the SE to NW, at a good
comparable to a jet. Area
obscured further observation.
No sound-but radio reaction
seemed to be slight.

A series of saucer sightings in Tucson, Arizona, late last June turned out to be the work of a group of students who were leading up small-sized, balloon-like objects. The students were supposedly a serious attempt to study wind velocities, though the students insist plagued to have caused several people, including a local professor, to mistake their experiences for genuine UFO's.

THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN
TUCSON, ARIZONA - JULY, 1962

Saucers Shoot Rockets over Tucson, Arizona
By Coral E. Lorenzen

"Some doors opened in the bottom and something came out." An unconventional aerial object hovered for a period of time at Tucson, Arizona and a strange device had lowered to the ground. The boy relating the details was 14-year-old John Westmoreland and his brother James told their next-door neighbor, Rosalie Black, about the night of June 25, 1962 in the tent in the Westmoreland back yard and during the course of four hours had witnessed a strange but revealing chain of events.

On the evening of the 20th of June I opened the Tucson Daily Citizen newspaper. When I came to the local news section, there were a few paragraphs out of the page: "Saucers, Rockets Inhabit Night Sky."

I scanned the article briefly and reached for the telephone book. Seconds later I was talking to Mr. Logan Westmoreland, the mother of John and James Westmoreland. She graciously invited Mr. Lorenzen and me to come to her home and interview the boys. Three hours later we were seated in the comfortably furnished living room of the Westmoreland home in southeast Tucson.

The boys were eager to talk about their adventures, partly I suspect, because they were not much about that they got the gist of the story as we started the slow process of cross-examination.

The three boys had been given permission to spend the night in the tent, so, armed with a deck of playing cards, pad and pencil, they settled down in a game of 500 Rummy by lantern light. Shortly before nine they were bored with cards and not sleepy, so they decided to go outside, watch for meteors and look at the stars and try to catch an errant cooling breeze. The summer night was in the offing and the air was warm and humid. The day had been hot; the night air was a welcome change.

At about 9 o'clock John noticed a star at 3 degrees south of due west, 30-40 degrees elevation, which didn't behave

like a star. It was very bright, white in
color, and moved around a little. In
the 'wow' words, soon it dimmed, moved
a little toward the south, but a few
degrees in altitude and then became stationary.

The boys soon lost interest and went
back into the tent to another game of
rummy. From time to time they picked
out and took a look at the strange star
but it "just stayed there". Then at about
11:45 things began to happen.

The bright "star" became much brighter and seemed to move closer. Instead
of looking like a star, it assumed a triangular shape as if grew larger. Then it
became stationary again. How long this
process took the boys did not know, but
according to the kitchen clock (they were
peeking in the window to check the
time), a surprising thing happened at
12:15. Three green flares or rockets
fired horizontally from the main
object.

At this time, John scrambled into the
tent and emerged with the score pad
and pencil. He decided to keep notes.
On the pad he wrote: "At 9 o'clock at
night we saw a flying saucer. At 12:15
it shot three green things that traveled
faster than any plane." Three rockets
were too fast to track visually.

After the first "rocket" was fired,
John noticed the second "saucer"
which we will hereafter refer to as
Number Two. It came in racing from
west to east and seemed to be "turning" and came to rest at about
13 degrees east of north at a slightly
greater elevation than No. 1. Shortly
after which appeared closer and brighter a "saucer" which came in from
the bottom of No. 2. About three
minutes later No. 2 was again approached by the tiny object and again the boys
watched as it seemingly disappeared into
the bottom of No. 2.

No. 1 was still in the same position,
appearing to be triangular in shape,
and No. 2 appeared much closer and
round-shaped with two lights or still
like protuberances on the underside.
A third flare emerged from No. 1,
and was shortly "received" by saucer
No. 2. Things were getting interesting.

No. 3 then shot out a rocket which
was seen by the boys to come from
No. 2 began to turn and fade into the
night sky and was not seen again. It
retained its same position.

At this time, Saucer No. 3 was spotted

at about 100-110 degrees and about 45
degrees elevation. It appeared the largest and highest of the three, which suggests that it was closer. The detail reported by the boys bears this out.

The most interesting part of the show was
yet to come.

Number three, spotted a "something"
superstructure above an apparently
round aircraft. Its color was white, and
like the others it made absolutely no
sound. At 1:16 a jet plane was overhead later decided it was probably in the
flight pattern of Davis-Monthan A.F.B.
Strategic Air Command installation,
and at 1:08 a mile from the Waterville home.

The new visitor closed in and three
of the still-like protuberances "popped
out." Then the object gained altitude.
An elongated dark "something" did not
from above the circular rim and there
in the small rocket-like objects centered
in quick succession. In a few brief minutes they were back. Two doors swung
open, down, and back up against the
underside of the saucer. As the doors
opened, the "very" receding into the
saucer was seen. The object then swiftly entered the opening wide
by one. The big circular saucer slowly
and moved sideways, then became stationary again.

The newspaper had printed only the
(See Saucers Shoot, page 4)

cept for general movement of the objects. In describing saucer No. 3, John
had written: "Something hovered from
the bottom. Something came out."

I asked John what he meant by that.
He said that something which looked
like a rim or cable came out and flew
around a little. I asked him what
color it was, and pro he described
James, who was with him, as having
wondered how they could tell colored
at that time of the night and asked
them. "From the light" they said.
"What light was that?" I asked. Then
they told me that from the side rim
of a red light some form emerged from
that extended to the ground. When the
long, reptile object began to come out,
it was clearly visible and appeared to
be brown in color.

The boys estimated that the "something" was extended from three to five
minutes. After which it began to come
up into the saucer again. After it had
cleared the top of the ridge bordering
the valley, it seemed to the boys that
was on the other side of the ridge.

The youngsters stayed up a little longer, but, before long, the excitement of

(Continued from page 3)

the night and their lack of sleep over
came their curiosity and they retired
into the tent. As soon as they had
awakened in the morning they rushed
in to tell Mrs. Westmoreland what they
had seen.

Pat Westmoreland, about 40, is an understanding mother but a firm one. She
thought at first that perhaps the boys
had had a touch of imagination and
set about using all the trapping tricks
the know to trip them up in their story,
but to no avail. She began to realize
that they had had a real experience.
She decided the newspapers should
know what had happened the preceding
night and called the local paper. The
which had drawn my attention came
out that I should be noted here that the
newspaper printed the notes, pointing
out that it could be imaginary or real
they printed it because it was a sensational story.

The matter of the boys' honesty comes
to mind as a matter of course in these
investigations. After three long visits
with the boys, during which time Mr.
Lorenzen walked with them to the wash
over which they thought the "UAO" had
hovered, and I had sketched the objects
from their imaginations, we found no
indication that the boys were not telling
the truth. Mr. Lorenzen said that he had
not caught any signs of strain, research, or conversation or trickery during his
talks with them while walking to and
from the wash. Nor did I ever detect
any evidence that the boys were attempting to perpetrate a hoax. Some of
the things which impressed me concerning the sighting as well as the honesty
of the boys were these:

When attempting to describe the object which was brought to my attention
or cable, John Westmoreland said he
got the impression that the object was
about as long as his father - in other
words, its length estimated approximately
the height of his father who is about
5 feet 6 inches. No. 3 shows above
Pantano was as the boys felt it was,
are have an idea of its size as well as
the size of the pocket or flares and the
size of the object which was pulled up
into the large object.

The rim of the saucer appeared to
have the same angular displacement as
a few feet cross arm on a utility pole at
the corner of the Westmoreland lot. It
was over Pantano wash (quarter mile
distant) it was approximately 50 feet
in diameter. The small objects then
would be about the same size as the
"rockets", and containing the same material composition. (See sketches).

It is interesting and tempting to speculate that one of the "rockets", sometime or other, had become disabled,
and was withdrawn, and eventually a recovery effected. The latter phase of the
sighting, in which a dozen was hovered
in the ground and resumed to saucer
No. 3 with a triangular-shaped object
at the end of it, could have been lost
"recovery." This may further be supported by the fact that after the object
was taken into the saucer, the saucer
left. The recovery of that object may
have been the sole purpose of the presence of the small objects.

It is interesting to note that after
the saucer was taken up, the local newspaper were not interested in further information or a follow-up story.

On the 29th, a group of local college students went up some balloons full
of with ordinary kitchen gas and lighted
by candles around in fireproof crepe
paper. Although this was not accepted by the local press, the Westmoreland sighting, the idea of saucers
had been firmly implanted in the public mind. A local professor of atmospheric physics who is interested in UFO, was
told of the strange lighted object in the
sky, and went to the U. of A. astronomy lab to track the thing. The story
of his sighting was in the Arizona Star
morning paper for Friday 29 June 1962.
Upon exiting the details, plus the theory
that the thing was an "extended source
of light," wondered if some hoaxers
might have been at work. I called the
Tucson Citizens sighting committee on
the telephone and gave them a copy of
the Thursday evening object and suggested that the object seen that night
might have been the result of a prank.

Later news stores stated that the college boys involved in the "prank" were
"carrying out experiments dealing with
wind velocity and other weather conditions." Coinciding the type of balloon
made balloons, and the fact that it contained dangerous highly inflammable gas
which was used to a device with an open
flame, it is not likely that any such experiment was being carried out. It appears more likely that a chicken prank
was being played and the "young men"
involved. But our work in sighting their
movement was not conclusive. We had
no experience.

It is remarkable that the newspapers
were satisfied with the experiment ex-

planation and stated that these "experiments" may have been the cause of the
saucer sighting in Southern Arizona in
the past few months. Certainly, the
easiest way to dispose of the perplexing
UFO problem is to ignore the evidence
which proves it is more serious than
A large percentage of the press is in
denial to do precisely that.

In the case of this latter sighting, the
only two observers of the lights, despite the hoax were called the oldest
was a fellow. The local press gave the
impression that these who viewed the
hoax objects were completely fooled,
but that was not the case.

The event of the week of June 20-30
was a continuation of the controversy
that I have had far several months
the psychological interpretation. Skeptic is often so intent upon destroying that which he does not care to believe, by attempting to label it a hoax
or a misconception of a conventional object, that he sets about to perpetrate a
hoax to support his own contention and
allay his subconscious fears.

A thorough perusal of newspaper stories concerning the Westmoreland sighting as well as causing reports of unidentified sky objects emphasizes the foolhardiness of accepting press stories lacking information pertaining to UFO sightings as presented by the news media and politics
up the need for thorough investigation.

Had I accepted the Westmoreland story
as presented by the Tucson Citizens, I
would have had a short dissertation ending in a dissertation lacking in depth. A few hours spent in investigating details and
going to the source of the story - instead of one of the most detailed sighting
of an unconventional aerial object we
has ever been observed.

Ice Cutter Encounters
"Lake Lights"

On June 17, 1962, strange lights on
the shore of Erie, Pennsylvania, near the
Presque Isle State Park, were seen by
Kate Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth M.
Black. Coast Guard, said the lights
were seen by several individuals including the ship's crew. The object was cutting through heavy ice all the way to the Canadian shore and Black
said "the closer we moved toward them,
the fainter away they seemed to be."
Black also said he believed the lights
were the result of unusual atmospheric
conditions causing lights to be refracted on the horizon. He is interesting to
note that these conditions - that
they were chasing something light - was
apparently not mentioned or considered
by Black.

11. The investigating officer is the squadron intelligence officer, and although not currently on flying status he rated both pilot and navigator.

The following comments are provided as pertinent to the situation:

a. At the time that the observer reported clear skies, the local weather unreported coverage was found in paragraph 7a. Although the sighting may have not been probable, it certainly was not impossible.

b. The observer described the light conditions as dark at 24 minutes after sundown.

c. The area in which the object was sighted is aligned with that of air traffic approaching Byrd Field, but the object's description and duration of observation does not suit aircraft identification.

d. Byrd Field Control tower operators were questioned concerning unusual observations during the subject reported sighting, but with negative results.

e. Parachute flares from the Camp Pickett area (37 CW/77 53 W) were considered, but not deemed possible because of Camp Pickett location and their schedule of operations and parachute flare limitations.

f. The only obvious possible discrepancies of the observer's statements are those of:

(1) Sky coverage
(2) Description dark or light conditions at 24 minutes after sundown.

g. The investigating officer has checked local sources for information and has not been able to identify the sighting.

Summary of 1 July Sighting

1. The sighting described below is forwarded with limited detail as the sighting was so positively identified as UFOB L.

2. Dr. [redacted], age 44, City of Richmond, Va. made the following sighting. He observed a clearly source near 200 yards approximately ten minutes after 2200 EST, 1 July 62 at the same location in Richmond described in attachment 1. It first came into sight on a magnetic bearing of 065° 130 and went out of sight on a magnetic bearing of 065°.

3. An initial check with NASA was made and this sighting coincided with the passing of ECHO L.

4. As this sighting is considered obviously resolved, no further information is included.
