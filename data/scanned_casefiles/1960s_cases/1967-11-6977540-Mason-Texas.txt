35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

At 5:58 I saw two lights in the sky going from west to east. The objects were apart approximately, when my arms were held out and my index fingers were extended the index fingers were about 1½ inches apart when each finger obliterated one object. I would judge the speed to be in excess of that of satellites that I have observed in the past. When the second object came to a stop I imagine the object came to a stop from the regular motion in a very short space. One might even state that it was an abrupt stop and the color seemed to change from a bluish blue-white to a reddish color and then back to a blue white. The other object kept on going. About 25 minutes be fore we saw another object that we took to be a satellite. In the south also going from a west to east direction, the direction of this object seemed to be west to south.

The object was placed in position at 6:00 A.M. and at such a time perhaps military observers were eating or changing shifts and the approach of dawn would be in their favor if such a positioning was to be secretive.

I might add that the object was in the same place Saturday evening, Sunday Morning and I also thought I saw it in place on Sunday evening but a light "Cloud cover was forming so this is a factor to be considered on Sunday even ing sighting.

The following report was submitted to SAFOIR (Colonel Mccoy) by Dr. sighted a UFO while on a hunting trip at Fredericksburg, which is approximately 18 miles south of Mason, Texas.

Saturday morning (Nov. 25, 1967) we were on a deer stand (approximately 15 to 20 feet above the ground). We arrived there about 5:00 PM. While looking into the sky, we saw two flying objects. They looked like two lights and were shining in a northerly direction. From the west. They moved in a straight line to a due north position and stopped. One light became a stationary object. The second became stronger. It went from a yellow to a blue-white color and blinked like a star.

At 6:00 it went into a position in front of the other light. The other light went off in an easterly direction.

It was a clear, cold night.

The remaining light stayed there until nothing else could be seen in the sky in the daylight.

At about 2:00 in the morning, we heard a whirring sound and a column of light appeared at the window. It was a soft bluish light and remained there for about four minutes.
