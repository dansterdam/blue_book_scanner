Date  Month  Year
34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questioned as a narrative explanation of your sighting: 

At 5:15 I saw two lights in the sky going from west to east. The objects appeared simultaneously. When my attention was held out and way, a car passed and the index fingers were about 1/2 inches apart when each object was at its closest to the other. When it stopped, the object came to a stop from the regular motion. Then it started up again and seemed to be an erratic motion and then back to a blue white. The other object kept on going. The one I saw seemed to be travelling about 25 mph in the direction that is southeast to the west. The motion of the objects seemed to be erratic and appeared to be maneuvering. This is about the only information I can give you. The object was sighted by military observers and they were noting down the changes in color and some flashing lights and the approach would be in their favor if such a positioning was to be ascertained. I thought I saw it in place on Sunday evening and Tuesday cover forming so this is a factor to be considered a continuing sighting.

The text transcribed from the document is as follows:

The following report was submitted to SAFOID (Center - Nov. 27, 1967) and referred to NOXCN reporting ID No. P-1 - 0010. Occurred approximately 16 miles south of Mason, Texas.

Saturday morning (Nov. 25, 1967), we were on a deer stand (approximately 8 to 10 feet off the ground). We arrived there about 5:00 P.M. While looking into the sky, we saw two flying lights about 1/2 mile and they were moving in a northeasterly direction. They lighted in a field and stopped. One light became a stationary object. The second one was somewhat larger and appeared to be a blue-white color and like a star.

As 5:00 it went into a position in front of the other light. The other light went off in an easterly direction.

It was a clear, cold night.

The remaining light stayed there until nothing else could be seen in the sky in the daylight.

At about 2:00 in the morning, we heard a whirring sound, column of light appeared at the window. It was a sort bluish and remained there for about four minutes.

The image contains a photograph showing two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass-like diagram with directions labeled around the perimeter. The smaller sketch shows a landscape with mountains and a road or path in the foreground.

Q. How IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.
A. In the larger sketch, the letter "B" is placed in the center, indicating the position of the observer relative to the direction from which the phenomenon was last seen.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.
IF THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND DRAW ARROWS TO SHOW THE DIRECTION OF MOTION, IF ANY, THAT THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO TAKE REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO INDICATE OBSERVED MOTION.
