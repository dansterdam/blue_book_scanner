    Mars was rising on an Az of 117 at approximately 2130 CT

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer watched a large red colored object in the SE. The object was long shaped, larger than an airplane. Other people in a group saw the object also. The object was in view for about 30 minutes then it just disappeared. There were high broken clouds, long night which could have accounted for the light disappearing.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Mars would have been quite bright with a stellar magnitude of ~-0.1.
