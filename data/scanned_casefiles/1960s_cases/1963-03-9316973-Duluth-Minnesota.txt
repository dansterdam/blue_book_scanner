Mars Still Shines Brightly
Mars is rapidly drawing away from earth but is still easy to identify by its red color and its brightness, greater than any visible star except Sirius, James Stokley reports.

ALTHOUGH MARS IS rapidly moving away and getting fainter as it does so, the planet remains a conspicuous feature of the March evening skies.

Its position, at the middle of the month, is shown on the accompanying maps. These give the appearance of the skies about 10 p.m. your own local time at the first of March, an hour earlier at the mid-month and two hours earlier at the end. Mars is high in the south, in the constellation of Cancer, the crab.

Mars Easy to Identify
Two features make Mars easy to identify. First is its brightness, greater than any visible star except Sirius, which is lower and to the right in Canis Major, the great dog. Also Mars is distinctly red in color. And it shines with a steady light, unlike the twinkling stars.

On Feb. 2, Mars made its closest approach to earth, for this visit; then it was 62,280,000 miles away. Now it is rapidly receding, to 69 million miles on March 1, and 82 million miles on the first of April. All of this it is rapidly dimming. At the end of March it will be about half as bright as at the beginning of the month.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 23, 1963

VETERINARY MEDICINE
Domestic Animal Cancer Rate Highest in Cows

THE COW appears to have a higher cancer rate than any other large domestic animal, but dogs and cats are also susceptible.

Serious economic loss results from a variety of tumors in the large domestic mammals, Dr. J. E. Moulton of the Sch Veterinary Medicine, University of fornia, Davis, told the Conference on Zoology of Cancer in Animals held at New York Academy of Sciences in N. Y.

More tumors and cancer of the lymph nodes occur before slaughter age in animals, cancer of the blood-forming tissues far outnumbers all its other manifestations, and among dogs, lymph tumors are most prevalent.

Boxers had more leukemic tumors any other dogs among 300 cases reviewed by Dr. Hilton A. Smith of the S Forces Institute of Pathology, Wash. D. C. Cocker spaniels ranked next, for various third, Boston terriers fourth.

ASTRONOMY
Drawings of Sunspots Aid Solar Understanding

ASTRONOMERS have become chart artists to sketch the spots of the sun. These drawings help predict the sun's behavior.

The shape and structure, growth at different times, active sunspot characteristics are studied by making a penumbral filament measuring one of an arc or less, about 1/200th of the diameter of the moon.

This method is particularly valuable when poor atmospheric conditions prevent clear photography, reported Patrick S. McIntosh of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories in Hanscom Field, Mass.

Superior quality photography of sunspots are certain only when the telescope is lifted above the atmosphere. Ground-based observations occasionally resolve details not possible from ground.

Work was done at the Sacramento Peak Observatory, observations were made through eyepiece that magnify 80 times. Drawings were made with a chromium filter. The drawings were corrected for distortion and then enlarged to a uniform scale of one second arc per millimeter by comparing them with a projection device.

Any young astronomer considering investigating this method should remember this warning: Do not look directly at the sun with your naked eye or through a telescope unless it is heavily shaded with a dense filter. Unprotected exposure can cause blindness by careless observation.

Visual drawings are sometimes influenced by the subjectivity of the designer, and must be corrected by comparison with projection drawings. Sometimes the details of the sunspots are too complex to be copied, or their reproduction is imperfect.

MARS—as the Mariner flew by Venus last December.

Already such a Soviet Martian probe is on its way; if all goes well it will reach back within a few months. Perhaps within a year the U. S. Mariner B will be launched toward the red planet—and it will give us by television some brief close-up glimpses of the Martian surface.

BIOTECHNOLOGY
Platinum Electrodes Help Diagnose Heart Defects

A QUICKER and more accurate diagnosis of the surgically correctable defects in the valves that control the flow of blood through the heart and lungs may be achieved by inserting tiny platinum electrodes into the heart, by Drs. Eliot Corday and Robert B. T. Stel, ton of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical School and Cedars of Lebanon Institute for Medical Research have reported in experimental animals.

The electrodes, which are specifically sensitive to a vitamin C solution, are placed one on either side of a valve through a catheter technique. This involves inserting them via long, flexible tubes which are pushed in through blood vessels going to the heart.

A test solution of vitamin C is then injected into the heart via the catheter on the downstream side of the valve.

If the valve is normal, only the electrode downstream will detect the vitamin C. If the valve is defective, some of the solution with regurgitate back through the valve and be detected by the electrode on the upstream side.

The UCLA investigators believe that with refinement, the method may provide a means to evaluate the degree of valvular insufficiency and whether the patient might benefit from surgery or medical treatment.

GI Jeep Radio's Voice Made Much Stronger

CI JEEPS now have 100-pound, double-distance radios to report information and receive commands. The two-way transistorized set is called the "Angry-106." It uses single sideband circuitry that reaches miles over rough country, with ten times the signal power, and twice the range of earlier models.

The Angry-106 was completed in two years by the U. S. Army Electronics Research and Development Laboratories, Fort Monmouth, N. J. Its contractor was General Dynamics of Rochester, N. Y.

New Cancer Treatment From Detection Method

DOING what surgery cannot do, a new method of treating cancer with radioactive iodine has been developed by a team of Walter Reed General Hospital physicians.

This procedure is now being used to treat tumors of the gastrointestinal tract through the administration of radioactive iodine. The treatment may precede or follow surgery.

The method involves the use of radioactive iodine and ethiodol, the contrast material, the researchers can eliminate lymph nodes not reached by surgery.

CLEVELAND-E 142nd St area-Mar 6, 1963-5PM
A piece of hot metal, weighing about 6 lbs, 
crashed through the roof of a colonial 
type home. The object, made of cast-iron 
and measuring about 7" on a side, was tri-
angular in shape. It was found by the home-
owner who said it made a loud noise and 
like a part of an automobile's fly-wheel" 
said the startled home-owner. Speculation 
was that it is a part of an aircraft's 
brake-plate mechanism. The Federal Aviation 
Agency has taken charge of the strange 
"intruder".

Wimbledon Sector

The following account is given
by a resident of Wimbledon who
was watching from his back garden
on Wednesday evening. A bright
object was seen moving slowly
across the sky. It was a bright
object, brighter than a star, flying
from Great Malvern to the Wimbledon
area. Did anyone else see it?

It would be good if someone
else could confirm the sighting.
The details are as follows:

On Wednesday at 8.55 pm.

Description of incident:
This object, described as a bright
white object, was seen over Wimbledon,
but not identified. It was moving
slowly.

Speed: Over 500 mph.

Position: Somewhere over
Wimbledon Common, spanning
from southwest to northeast.

Note: A resident, who wishes
to remain anonymous, saw the
object and reported it. Such
reports are always welcome...

THE ABOVE PHOTO (not related to the Moore story, which begins on Page 10), was
sent to us by a correspondent in Albany, N.Y., who wishes to remain anonymous.
He states that at about 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of March 12th, 1963, he was
sitting on the back porch of his home when a UFO flew into sight at low altitude and moved several hundred feet across the house. He ran inside for his camera, and took three pictures in quick succession as the object
moved slowly toward the east. It made no sound.

Albany, New York, March 12, 1963. A correspondent of SAUCER NEWS the makes to retain this anonymous photo of a UFO on the back porch of his home when a UFO flew into sight at low altitude at about 2:30 P.M. on this afternoon. The photo shows a small disc, gray in color, flying over several trees. (Source: SAUCER NEWS, James Mosley.)

LOCAL SIGHTINGS
AKRON, Ohio-March 22-10:10 PM-Mrs. Bralek has a habit of surveying the sky then outdoors. It was a clear night when she spotted a moving orange object, "a sort of a medium star". The light was first seen in the area of Orion's belt in a southerly direction. She calls to her Culver her 16 x 50 binoculars. In the binoculars, the object resolved into a sphere, the apparent size of the saucer and 30 ft. pencil. As it moved directly westward, it hovered in at least five different instances. The duration of these hoverings ranged from momentary to four seconds.

After watching the change object move through about 25° toward the western horizon, she was distracted by another object which arose through the sky at low altitude. It also moved from E to W. It was like a baseball in size, the color was bluish-green, and was giving off sparks like a 4th of July sparkler. The object was seen for 4-5 seconds before disappearing very low in the sky. She said something black seemed to be attached or trailing object.

"It looked like a piece of black lace," she said. Then she shifted her attention to the original orange object, it was gone.

Duration, overall 4-5 minutes. No sound.

Scout Leader Observes
Strange Light

On the afternoon of March 22, 1963,
between 3:30 and 4:00 p. m., Mrs. Bar-
bara Warren, an assistant den mother at
Richardson, Texas, witnessed the passage
overhead of unusual aerial objects. The
four UFOs were described as being white
in color and oval in shape, more rounded
than oblique. The outlines were not sharp
and were fuzzy around the edges. They
moved at great speed and didn't reflect
sunlight although it was a sunny day
with good seeing conditions.

The first two which traveled toward
the east passed one after the other and
were not in formation. A few minutes
later another one appeared, going west.
This was immediately followed by a sec-
ond object which was going west, also,
and which changed course suddenly and
moved toward the north. No more were
seen.

CANTON, OHIO........3/27/63......7:40 PM.
An object which blinked once in a while, 
and whose color was silver with an orange 
tint, was seen moving across the sky from 
SW to NE. The principal witness caught it 
at approx 30°elev. His brother, 2 sisters, 
a cousin, and a neighbor girl were also 
witnesses. At 7:50PM it went out of sight.
At about 7:55PM they spotted 4 to 6 objects 
directly North at 35° elev that were mov-
ing toward the east. These objects were 
the same color and shape as the earlier 
object, but moving very fast. Within 3-4 
minutes they were out of sight. (Report

Tom is a high school student. The object was a white light, slow-moving, and going coward the western horizon. He caught sight of it somewhere between the moon and the horizon 1/4. It was as large as a bright star...(first mag.)

He used 2Cx50 binoculars supported on a steady base. It was seen as a white light up and a red one down, the red one pulsating faster than once a second. He could not recognize it as a plane. No duration - great night, wing light. Duration 5 minutes.----April 3, from 10:45 to 10:54 PM, he reported another white light, moving from NW to SSW. It was low, soundless, and about 400° elevation-again no green light-bright. Received as an aircraft. (also 2Cx50 binoculars) -- April 4, 10:05-10:10PM. A white light at 100° elevation and extremely bright was seen.... Then it was due N in its S to N path, red light was seen flickering. Again-no sound. No green light....

WOOSTER, OHIO-March 31, 1963.....8:00 PM
Two women were driving along in the Northwestern suburbs area of Wooster when a brilliant white light the size of an auto headlamp flashed downward from an estimated 150 angles. This object was seen through the front windshield and travelling in the same direction as the car. Suddenly, the object stopped its descent, seemed to hover momentarily, and then leveled off traveling ahead of the car. At first the car which was being driven at 30 mph kept pace with the "leading" object, but the big round light then gradually picked up speed until it seemed to be moving at an estimated 75 mph. It kept its low altitude and horizontal W to E line of flight and disappeared after 8 minutes. No sound or change of color, no radio or car trouble.

The image appears to be a scanned document page, but most of the text is very faint and illegible. I can make out a few partial lines of text, but cannot confidently reproduce them. The page seems to be part of an official document with numbered lines on the left side and right side margins. The overall image is in black and white and looks like an old microfilm or carbon copy document.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

The text I can clearly read is:

277-40
277-153
277-152
277-158
7-1-63

At the bottom of the page, there is a partially legible line that appears to read:
"... signal, wing, intelligence service. ..."

The rest of the text is either too blurry or obscured to confidently transcribe. There are several horizontal black lines at the top of the document that appear to be redactions or censorship marks.

The text on this page is partially legible. I can make out some words and phrases, but not the entire text clearly. The parts I can read include:

"...while they have to sit down at..."

"...first place from they started..."

The rest of the text is too faint or blurry to confidently transcribe. There are two black redaction bars at the top and bottom of the document, obscuring some text.

The document appears to be a typewritten page, likely from a report, with a handwritten note "31 March" at the top right corner.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Then looks were very strong. In comparison with this
rest it could possibly 5 to 3 11 seconds. Light went
off me and lasted this morning iridescent light.
Lost the spots on those looked these looks were from
left to right as the object moved from left to 3 to
