PROJECT BLUE BOOK REPORT

FIVE successive observations were made of a peculiar object and disappeared to the east. The object appeared to be moving silently and slowly towards the northwest, while turning a yellowish-white and then green and white lights as shown on plot.

Sergeants and two neighbors, at 2030 local time. Objects, oblong, about 50 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15-20 feet high, moving slowly and down easterly direction, white and green lights, seen for approx 3 minutes, disappearing to north at a few thousand feet, no noise. So this object is eliminated as a weather balloon. Object disappeared on 3 September.

A object was observed to the North of Cheyenne by a group of eight young civilians whose names are indicated in the report. The object appeared for a moment, moving slowly westward, disappearing shortly thereafter. It gave off a pulsating type of light and seemed a dark, nebulous shape.

The object first sighted by a SSgt, who informed two members of the base, and the Base Commander. The Base Commander immediately attempted to launch Falcon M-192 but was unable to do so. The object returned to the site and was moving very slowly towards the northeast.

The members of the Civil Engineering Geodectic Survey and the Sonar crew from the local naval training center. An unidentified object was observed above their location and was moving at a fairly high rate of speed towards the east-southeast.

The request information as to whether this or the previous report may be of interest or concerned.
