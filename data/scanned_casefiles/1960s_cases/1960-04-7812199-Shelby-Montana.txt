Dear Sirs,

I have on 6 different occasions seen U. F. O. what they are I dont propose to know. I'm not writing you to be made a public spectacle of only I think you should know these things. I dont want only I dont want my name mentioned in a crack pot observation. I watch for them when I am out side. These last 2 times I saw them I had my 8 mm. Camera loaded with film I aimed it at them if I got any picture I dont know the film is still in my Camera if you would like to develop it and see if there is any thing on it you are very welcome to it. And also where could it report them if I see all them again within immediate action could be taken to catch them. We have at Salts Air Base 7 but we k. Air Base here close
