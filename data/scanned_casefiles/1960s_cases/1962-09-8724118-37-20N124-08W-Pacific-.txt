NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 
6 SEP 63 
File: 1962,
Mystery Lights Aboard Ship
On 17 June, 1962, officlals at the US Naval Base at Subic, Philippine Islands, reported to the Naval Intelligence that on the night of 16 June, the Commanding Officer of the USS Fortaleza, an officer of the Philippine Navy, had reported sighting about strange unidentified lights seen around the docked Fortaleza. The lights were described as white in color, unusual in appearance, and seemed to be circling the ship on a coral reef near Quezon Island on Lingayen Gulf. The lights were observed for about 2 1/2 hours, after which they disappeared. A search party later found the Fortaleza undamaged. The body of a mystery ship, "Vesla", was found after disappearing some time before. The body is now beached at Laoag.
On 23 July, the officers of the Fortaleza gave a formal report. Commander Peter Westwood, Mr. J. Matheson and a guide translated. They stated that the lights were seen near the Fortaleza and that a light investigation was conducted, but the lights could not be identified. They remained constant and did not seem to be searchlights from another fishing vessel. At one point the lights appeared to be reflected in the water indicating their hovering over the surface. The lights faded gradually and were not seen to move or land. The officers could not account for the lights and had no explanation for them.

"No Case (Information Only)                                 8 September 1962
Duncanson, Robert:

Report on a report of a bright light seen over the Pacific Ocean near 37-20N 124-08W on 8 September 1962. The light was seen by the crew of a commercial jet aircraft at about 9:00 p.m. local time. The light was described as being larger than a star and stationary for about 5 minutes, then it disappeared. The location of this sighting is in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 300 miles west of the California coast. The Air Force was unable to identify the light object."

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

Another type of colored substance is the "blue rain" that sprinkled a thirty-mile stretch of countryside near London on September 9, 1962. Falling without warning from clear skies, it left a blue stain that wasn't washed off, even in investigation. Almost did the substance remain at Farnborough. The jets were using the blue dye to color their smoke and make a more spectacular display.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an incident where a mysterious object was observed near Wexford, Ireland. The text on the page reads:

Object Strikes Irish Field

A mysterious object, about the size of an automobile, was sighted with four strange beings on it. This object fell from the sky over Wexford, Ireland and made a crater about 6 inches deep in a cornfield. 
At the time the object fell, it was found lying on top of a man working in the field. He was stunned but not injured. The Garda (Irish Police) examined the field while waiting arrival of military experts from Dublin. No further details.
