NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                                                   6 Sep 63
                                                                                       Fiji Islands

Mystery Lights Aboard Ship

On September 6, 1962, officials at Suva, Fiji Islands related information about strange lights seen aboard the deserted Japanese fishing vessel Toka Maru No. 8, which went aground on a coral reef near Qoleleva Island on September 1, Qoleleva lies to the west of the big island of Vanua Levu.

It was north of Vanua Levu that the mystery ship "Joyita" was found after disappearing while on passage from Samoa to the Tokelau Islands. The Joyita is now beached at Levuka.

On September 2 an official party approached the Toka Maru without going on board. The party consisted of District Officer Peter Westwood, Mr. J. Muller, and a police constable. The official report states that all the Japanese fled when taken off by another fishing vessel, but that night (Sunday) they saw a light flashing from the direction of the stranded ship. They replied to the light but got no recognizable signal in return.

The next day the officials went out to the ship and found no one. No light was seen that night.

On Tuesday they stripped all electrical gear from the ship and that night saw a light burning brightly and steadily.

Mr. Westwood commented: "It was most unusual. It was suggested that Fijian villagers might have gone on board but there is no boat at Qoleleva. The sea was rough and it is a long way to swim. We took bearings on the light and it remained constant. Next morning the same bearing was the position of the ship. We could find no explanation for this."

IRELAND: Sept 9, 1962 Location of sighting: Duncanon, Ireland. Reported that a mysterious object the size of a baseball and, possibly, with 12 points has fallen from the sky. The object was found to land near a flour & Bakeman. In falling the object made a crater more than 3 ft. across. At the time of the fall an explosion was heard over a wide area. Army forces from Dublin came and took possession of the object. This report was heard over radio WCKY, Cincinnati, Ohio on the night of 9-9-62.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                                                9 SEP 62

Another type of colored substance is the "Blue rain" that sprinkled a thirty-mile stretch of countryside near London on September 9, 1962. Falling without warning from clear skies, it left a blue stain that wouldn't wash off. Investigation showed that the substance came from jet planes taking part in Britain's annual giant air show at Farnborough. The jets were using the blue dye to color their vapor trails and make a more spectacular display.

Object Strikes Irish Field

A mysterious object, about the size of a baseball with four spokes protruding from it, fell from the sky over county Wexford, Ireland and made a crater four feet in diameter on 8 September 1962.

Residents in the area reported an explosion within a half-mile radius at the time the object fell. It was found lying on top of a burned-up patch of grass near the crater cordoned off the field while waiting arrival of military experts from Dublin. No further details.
