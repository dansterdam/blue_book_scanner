The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. It contains a hand-drawn map with various labels and annotations. The map appears to show some kind of missile launch control centers or locations, as indicated by the letters "A", "D", "F", and "G" which appear to indicate missile launch control centers according to the text. There is also a note that says "Letters indicate missile launch control centers".

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
Sioux Army Depot, Nebraska
August 9, 1965

CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING SIGHTING

On 9 August 1965, at approximately 1430 hours, a security guard stationed at the Sioux Army Depot observed an unidentified object in the sky while conducting a routine patrol. The object was described as a silvery, disc-shaped craft hovering at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet above the depot grounds. 

The object remained in view for approximately 15 minutes before accelerating at a high rate of speed and disappearing from sight. No sound was associated with the object. Weather conditions at the time were clear, with minimal cloud cover.

The security guard immediately reported the sighting to the depot commander, who in turn notified the nearest Air Force installation. An investigation was launched, and this report documents the findings.

(2) Object again appeared in same location but on the next five successive observations flew a straight course and disappeared to the east. The object was first observed through binoculars by staff sergeant and two neighbors, at 1930 local time. Object, elongated, about the size of a Piper Cub airplane, was observed as it moved across the sky and out over the Missouri River. It was launched at 1915 and 1925, so this object is eliminated as a weather balloon. Object was observed on 3 August and 2 September. 

1. Object was observed to the North of Cheyenne by group of eight young children moving directly at a rate of about 600 mph, somewhat higher above horizon. There were three objects, size of a dollar coin, with a blinking light in the center.
2. Object first sighted by personnel at golf, who informed two members of the Target Alignment Team at a nearby launch site. The latter observed the object with a theodolite and identified it as Jupiter object 
3. The members of the Target Alignment Team and Geodetic Survey were visually tracking the object as we tested our radar, and can present their findings now.
4. The weather in all sightings was clear with occasional clouds.
5. Report was compiled by Major Elva D. Brown, Intelligence Staff Officer, with 15 years of experience.
6. Attached are four plots showing locations of observers and directions of movements.
7. Request information as to whether this or the previous report may be released to the public.

(2) Reported by military personnel with the aid of binoculars. Nine military personnel observed the objects the size of a star, which appeared to the southwest and traveled westward, disappearing in the distance. Very faint, and of short duration.
(3) Objects reported to be twice the size of a pinhead, appeared in the middle of the big dipper and moved on a level course as indicated. When they reached the Pleiades, they threw white objects grouped as they moved on.
Observed by three airmen of a Geodetic Survey Team, who observed them full of the Geodetic (equivalent to a 40 power telescope).
