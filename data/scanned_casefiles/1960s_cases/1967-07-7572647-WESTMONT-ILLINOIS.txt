Case: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Photo: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted and photographed an object that was cigar shaped, gray, and was not self luminous. It was cold, but the edges were fuzzy as if it were vibrating...

COMMENTS: Because of a filing error, investigation of the sighting was not initiated until a thorough investigation was impossible. The original negative of the photo was not available and will therefore be evaluated as insufficient data. Also the case will be listed as insufficient data because of age.

Dear Sir:

My friend snapped this picture while in and I was resting his new camera. The scene arrived around #00 CPT July 25, 1967 & was about 4 mile exactly & was traveling rapidly at about 

just in Downers Grove we felt like we only got time to take one picture please find enclosed a 3 page off the paper slow track report.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. here is a diagram of its path

[Note: Some words are partially illegible or cut off in the image]

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very low quality, high-contrast black and white document with significant noise and degradation. Most of the text is illegible. There is a photograph or document fragment positioned at an angle in the lower portion of the page, but the details are too obscured to read clearly. The page seems to be from an archival document, possibly a UFO-related report given the filename context, but I cannot confidently extract any specific text from this image.


- page 6 -

I apologize, but the text on this document is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scan. The image appears to be a black and white document with multiple horizontal bands, and a small photograph of a landscape with a tree and a building is positioned at an angle in the upper part of the page. However, I cannot make out any readable text from this image.

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
