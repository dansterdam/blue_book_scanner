August 12, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of July 30, 1964, in which you requested information on the time of a satellite which appeared over your area on recent evenings.

It is not clear whether you refer to the Los Angeles area, or the site in your address, or to the Washington site near Wilbur, as given on the transmack. Also, while your letter is dated July 30th, you state "last evening" (25th), so we are uncertain as to which two dates you observed the satellite.

If you will advise us the exact dates on which you made your observations, and the nearest city near you at that time, we will be glad to send you the detailed information.

You probably observed the passage of either Echo I or Echo II since these two satellites are very prominent in the skies and are the two satellites most often viewed.

Sincerely,

WINSTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division

Los Angeles, Calif.

Here is the text from the document:

[Letterhead location partially obscured] July 30th

Denver, Colo.
Gentlemen:

Last evening (25th) we sighted a satellite which traversed from NNW to NNE and about 7-23' west of the zenith.

At location in Forsyth 99 L., have 90 d. NNW. Visited, we saw a 'start' move over at the zenith at 9:20 P.M. still at a 35° to 38° direction.

Would you advise which of the several items going overhead, this one is.

Any advice as to the various visible satellites which may be noted in the early evening, will be appreciated.

Los Angeles, Calif.
28-29 July 1964

July 28-29: Los Angeles, Calif.: A strange yellowish object "with little things" darting about was seen at Van Nuys and a general police dispatcher was puzzled to call. In the meantime, there was a report of a pink pink vapor-like cloud over Azusa.
