The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with radiating lines, depicting an object in the sky. The second sketch shows two larger sketches - one of a person standing on a road with buildings in the background, and another smaller sketch of a person on a road with hills in the background.

OCR Output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The handwritten text in the document states:
"Last night at about 9:20 a.m. I walked out to look at the sky - was looking NW - saw a bright light about the size of your fist at arm's length. It was bluish-white in color and seemed to be hovering about 300 feet off the ground. It just hovered there for about 2 minutes, then suddenly took off straight up at a terrific rate of speed. I watched until it disappeared. I have 13 years in Project Blue Book, none scottish or the Atlantic ocean."

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

Dear Senator Prouty:

Your letter of 15 August 1960 to the Secretary of Defense, in behalf of Mr. C. F. Foster for Clover, Vermont, has been forwarded to this office for appropriate consideration as an unidentified flying object by Mr. Foster.

Mr. Foster's letter does not contain sufficient information on which to arrive at valid conclusions. The standard procedure would require a more detailed and comprehensive report to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for their analysis and final determination.

Please convey to Mr. Foster our appreciation for bringing this matter to our attention.

Sincerely yours,

Enclosure:
Honorable Winston L. Prouty
United States Senate

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from a document. The text on the page appears to be a form or questionnaire related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

The text from the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object or objects you observed.

Continued: Triangular-shaped of a bluish-white color, with the left side tinged with red. The middle filled with greenish-brown streaks and clouds of vapor. The right side with pulsating blue-white intensity. The whole formation moved up and down, to and fro, in a rather erratic manner, with abrupt stops and sudden changes of direction. Both vertical and horizontal movement. About 10-15 seconds duration.
