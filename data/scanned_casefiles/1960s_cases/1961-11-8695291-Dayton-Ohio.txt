clockwise direction, passing over about 4 times. Patterson dispatcher was contacted and he stated that there were 3 T-33's in area at time. 1 which was shooting landings

11. COMMENTS
Circle over Dayton area in a light pattern. Witness stated that when 1 light was overhead, it would go out, then come back on again, then when it was over Wright-Patterson it would go out again. This can be explained by fact that T-33 has two landing lights located in the nosewheel well, and upon taking off it will rotate witness saw the wheel are retracted. Then when preparing for a landing wheels are extended and at a distance they can appear to be one instead of 2. Light that disappeared to S was probably 1 of the other T-33's observed by witnesses were those on an a/c.
