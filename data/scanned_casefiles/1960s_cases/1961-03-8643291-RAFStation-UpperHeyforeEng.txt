10. BRIEF SUMMARY: Very bright white or yellowish, circular obj., size described anywhere fr orange size to basketball size. Obj appeared to be at about a 15° angle in relation to ground and remained there during entire period. Ground observers say obj. appeared stationary; radar observer said obj was moving very slowly.

11. COMMENTS: Direction of movement was not reported for visual observation. Planet Mars and a number of bright stars were at elevation reported for obj., to SW and W. Visual sighting possibly a celestial body. Radar return probably caused by radar bouncing off clouds.

HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL SIGHTING, MIDLAND RADAR CONTROL VECTORED
AN AIRCRAFT TO THE OBJECT ON THE SCOPE, BUT THE AIRCRAFT COULD SEE
NOTHING. AT THE TIME, THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED HE WAS AT 6000 FEET
AND ON TOP OF THE CLOUDS WITH NO CLOUDS ABOVE HIM. ALL CONVERSATIONS

H. NOTHING UNUSUAL THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING.

I. NO INTERCEPTION ACTION TAKEN.

J. THERE WAS NO AIR TRAFFIC OR KNOWN BALLOON RELEASE IN THE VICINITY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING.

K. THE BASE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, RAF UPPER HEYFORD IS THE PRE-PARING OFFICER OF THIS REPORT. THE REPORTING OFFICER DID NOT WITNESS THE UFO. THE ONLY THEORY THAT HAS THUS FAR BEEN ADVANCED IS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TEMPERATURE INVERSION CAUSING SOLID SECTIONS OF CLOUD DRIFTING WITH THE WIND. THIS MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE RADAR RETURN. THE BRIGHT LIGHT CANNOT BE SO EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR, AS ALL THE OBSERVERS INDICATE THAT THE LIGHT WAS VERY BRIGHT, THIS WOULD SEEM TO NEGATE ANY THEORY OF REFLECTION. THE HEADINGS OF THE OBJECT, AS TRACKED BY RADAR WERE MORE OR LESS CONSISTENT WITH THE WIND DIRECTIONS AT THE TIME. THE REPORTING OFFICER CAN OFFER NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE SIGHTING. THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT OR BALLOONS IN THE AREA THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING AND INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP NO INDICATIONS OF BALLOONS IN THE VICINITY. AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC WAS NONEXISTANT AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING. THE MIDLANDS RADAR CONTROL HAD NO AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS AFTER
