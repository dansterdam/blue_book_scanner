SUBJECT: Sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

TO: AFCSC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. The following Unidentified Object Reports (UFO's) are submitted as directed by AFR 200-2, 20 July 1962, amended and in the format prescribed in par. 74 of the regulation.

Report Number One:

a. (1) The object appeared slightly elongated. It was described as being 10 arc-seconds in overall size, or 5 to 10 times larger than the star Polaris. (Mr. Eldred)
The object had a definite configuration in contrast to star.

(2) Hatch Head
(3) Blue-White
(4) One
(5) N/A
(6) The object was traveling at a speed of 2 to 3 times the speed of the Echo Satellite.
(7) None
(8) N/A
(9) None

b. (1) The object was observed while preparing to shoot the star Polaris. The object was visibly sighted by Mr. Eldred and Mr. Elliot when observed the object with an optical instrument.

(2) The object was 30° from the horizon and on a due North heading.

Here is the text from the document:

(3) After the object was sighted it maneuvered and had a final heading of about 35° and climbed out of sight at an 40° angle of elevation.

(4) The object initially traveled on an Easterly heading for 100' of arc and made a 90° turn to the North. The object next slowed, executed a loop turn and took up a reciprocal heading. Upon reaching the intersection of the original Easterly flight path, it turned Easterly at a heading of about 35° and climbed out of sight.

(5) The object faded out as it climbed at a 40° angle of elevation.

(6) 3 min.

c. (1) Ground-Visual

(2) A 45XK Theodolite was the observing instrument used by Mr. Elliott. The instrument is made by Kern and is Model # DKM5-AK.

Mr. [redacted] was an ex-Navigator and Navigation Instructor. He has been making astronomical shots. For eight years. He is appropriately well informed and gave a concise account of his observations. I would assume that he is a stable and reliable individual.

Mr. [redacted], 56 years of age

Senior Spaniards Lab Technician

Mr. [redacted] has taken Solar Astronomy and Celestial Navigation courses. He has four years practical experience in Celestial Navigation with first order instruments. In addition, he has 250 hours of private flying time.
