October 6, 1966

Gentlemen,

On the night of October 5, 1966 at approximately 10:40 I sighted two strange lights in the sky. One appeared to be a satellite white dot, about the size of a pin head. Hill about one arms length away, moving across the sky at a reasonable speed, then this glowing cherry-red object came out of nowhere and was moving at a terrific speed compared to the white lights, so the red object approached the white light, the white light dropped, stayed still and let the red object pass overhead, then it came back on its approximately same course and went in the same direction as the red object.

The red object was in sight for about 3-5 seconds or the white light about 6-3 minutes.

The red object was long and was a steady light which did not blink as I watched it.
