PILOTING AN F4F ON STEEL TIGER MISSION WAS IN THE VICINITY OF
ICHEP AIRFIELD (XD 25485) AT 6,000 FT IN A LEFT TURN PASSING
100 DEGREES WHEN HE OBSERVED A UFO. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED
AT A RELATIVE BEARING OF ROUGHLY 120 TO 130 DEGREES FROM HIS
AIRCRAFT AT 45 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. AS HE OBSERVED THE
UFO THREE SECONDS THE PROJECT PASSED OVER THE AIRCRAFT ON 
A NORTHEASTERLY COURSE AND FADED FROM SIGHT (AS IF BURNING OUT).
AT ABOUT 12 DEGREES PAST THE VERTICAL, ALTITUDE WAS ESTIMATED AS
"POSSIBLY" 16,000 FEET ABOVE AIRCRAFT ALTITUDE - ONLY A "TAIL" OF
GASEOUS RESIDUE WAS OBSERVED WHICH WAS DESCRIBED AS SUSTAINED NO
D AND D ARC OF ABOUT 25 DEGREES - WHILE THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT, 
ISSLE AND BORDERED ON BOTH SIDES WAS A VERY BRIGHT GREEN. THE
"TAIL" DID NOT PERSIST BUT APPEARED TO MOVE WITH A "RUSHING" SOUND 
MUCH LIKE AN AFTERBURNER OR ROCKET EXHAUST. SMALL PARTICLES APPEARED
TO GET HIGHER AS IT WENT OVER THE OBSERVERS AIRCRAFT. WEATHER WAS
FIVE MILES IN HAZE WITH A SCATTERED LAYER AT 16,000 FEET. NO UNUSUAL
ATMOSPHERIC OR ELECTRONIC PHENOMENA WERE OBSERVED. THE PILOT STATED
THAT HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS A BIG COMET BUT IT APPEARED TO BE
UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL.
