PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 15 FEB 62 2. LOCATION: Morgantown, Pennsylvania
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. DETAILS OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 8 minutes
8. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
9. COURSES: Westward
10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient Data (possible)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer watched at first an orange fireball, then a more obscure object coming from the east. The fireball type of object changed to one with a more distinct outline and light. The observer made several calculations to determine the object's altitude and speed. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation.

P.O. Box
Dear Sir:
Thank you for your report, which Lt. Marley has forwarded to me for comment. Your calculations appear correct in principle, but the speed could not have been calculated under the assumption of a straight course, as the object was apparently taking a very erratic course when the object was sighted. The calculation done in that way gives AAO mph.

The only part of the sighting which does not fit the description of a conventional aircraft is the very bright light, which is not ordinarily seen. 

I say ordinarily. Actually the hatch you calculated would indicate a jet aircraft size (over 20,000 ft. usually). It is a common for jet aircraft climbing through transsonic speeds to appear much brighter than normal. Are concentrated forward in a moderately wide beam.

I have done some calculations on the brightness of these light at various distances, and found, for example, that a 1,000 candlepower light, concentrated to a 20-degree beam will appear as bright as Venus (about -4 magnitude) at a distance of 30 miles. Thus the bright light does not strike me as unusual.

Text from the document:

The remaining configuration and colors of lights you describe sound just adequate, but they confirm the normal single light of identification, but in considering with our own observations with this plane through our own investigation. 

Yours truly,

Text from the document:

To: Project Blue Book,
Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Subject: UFO Report

Time: 9:16PM to 9:54 PM, February 14th, 1967.
Location: Southeast of Morgantown, Pennsylvania.
Duration of Observation: 38 minutes.
Description: at first, an orange fireball, then changing to a three light formation which changed color and size. The lights blinked on and off and changed from a steady burn to a non-blinking-continuous lights.
Atmospheric conditions other than pertaining to the size, speed, and altitude of this object:
Weather: SSW at 5o mph, temp. 33o F, Relative Humidity 77. Ceiling 12,000 ft.
Wind speed direction: SSW at 2-3 mile. Sound: a loud motor sound like a 4 motored propeller type.

Report on Observation: I live in a mobile home and later in the evening while watching television, the private line telephone rang. It was a civilian police officer that inquired if I had seen anything strange in the sky. I replied that I had observed some unusual lights east of my home at approximately 9:30 PM this evening. The officer stated that he and other officers had also observed the object and were perplexed by what it could be. The officer stated that several other civilians had also called to report the sighting. I advised the officer that I was a good observer with "good sighting" for observing the night sky. I had, in fact, observed unusual aerial phenomena on various occasions prior to this sighting. I stated that the object or objects were brilliantly lit, changing colors rapidly, and the shape appeared to be somewhat elongated. The lights were very much brighter than any stars in the sky here. Visual observations even rather close to the horizon are usually obscured due to the added atmosphere the light has to penetrate, but this observation was very clear and distinct. I could clearly make out the shape, color changes, and the fact that it was a solid, dark, silhouetted object, rather than just disembodied lights in the sky. After a few minutes, the object appeared to recede in the distance, the lights became dimmer and finally disappeared from view. I advised the officer that I would be glad to answer any further questions should the need arise.

( Later ) I measured the distance from where I was standing, by the space leading to the door about 30 ft to a line drawn between the door and the lower edge of the outer box that surrounded the object; then I stepped up to the door and called my wife out to see it, just in time to see the object move rapidly upward and obliquely forward and off into the distance. ( That distance, the 30 ft, is of course an estimate only and may not be critical). I noted that the outline of the object gave the appearance of a small box but that when I looked at it it appeared rather like a bright light or luminous glow rather than a clear-cut outline. I noted the time, which was 8:50P... when the object was directly South, I noted that I could see it clearly through the window panes without any distortion and that it appeared to be bright white or luminous.

After the fireball passed and was south west of me, it suddenly grew larger and more brilliant, going through the phases of changing from a small bright object to a very large, brilliant fireball, then it seemed to explode, and I saw several bright flashes or pulsations of light, after which it rapidly faded from view. The time from the beginning to the end of this sighting was about 10-13 seconds.

After the flreball receded, when it was traveling more West than South, I observed a very strange shaped object, somewhat crescent or semi-circular in shape, which seemed to emerge from the trailing edge or extension of the fireball, as if being pushed or expelled from it. This object was quite large, larger than the original fireball, and was illuminated, with the illumination seeming to come from its trailing edge or rear. It traveled in the same direction as the fireball, but at a slightly slower speed, appearing to peel off or break away from the main body of the fireball. After it had traveled some distance away, it seemed to disappear or fade from view.

 I knew that the speed of the fireball and the strange shaped object were far in excess of any known aircraft, and the size and brightness were beyond anything I had ever seen. I am quite sure it was not an aircraft or meteor or any other known object.

For calculations, the diameter of the original small box-like object was 6 inches, and the observed distance of 30 ft places the object 6 ft across my line of sight, or a ratio of 6 inches in 6 ft or 1 in 12, so that if the true diameter of the object was 4 ft, the observed diameter would be 4 inches. Given the observed size of 6 inches and the calculated 4 ft diameter, the original distance must have been about 24 ft, which is only an estimate.

Since 53 ft/sec equals 36 mi/hr; then 7.47 ft/sec equals 1 mi/hr.
730/7.47 equals 550 mi/sec.

This gives the observed diameter of the object at 24 inches, was made at a distance of 24 inches, and a true diameter of 4 ft is calculated.

The image contains a diagram with geometric shapes and annotations, but no photograph. The text in the document reads:

Calculation, the correction for the real diameter.
Notes: the apparent diameter is really the hypotenus of a right triange; and since this one is in a 45 degree over the correction merely multiplying the apparent diameter by 1.414 which is the ratio of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side of a 45 degree triangle.

Transcription of the text:

If the sound log in 13 inches ft. a distance of 24 inches; then the ratio timer 1/2 the speed of sound will give the real speed of the object. 60/24=2.5 which is 1750 ft/sec. Then 51.4 diameter per 57 seconds.

7.6 seconds have elapsed in 17 seconds; then 51.4/7.6=6.8 gives 6.8/7.6=0.89 which will give the real calculated diameter which is 51.4.

The object is traveling at 45 degree angle and at a speed of 24 inches, the object diameter is 51.4 inches and the time needed to travel an equal distance is determined as I have just calculated.

So the same amount of time is needed for the round to travel the distance. This is the time given for the round to travel the same distance which is 17,650 ft/sec. Which is the correct speed from the observers. Therefore, this is 17,650 ft/sec which is the true speed of the object.

By dividing by 1.4 (the can calculated sound is 1176) we have a true speed of the object of 12,628 ft.

As a result of these calculations, I have to mind that the object was at an estimated range of 250 miles/hr.

Sincerely Yours:

MORGANTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA
9 FEB 1967
PROJECT BLUE BOOK FILE NO. 9665950

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S) SIGHTED:
Large spherical object, silvery in color, was observed moving in the sky. The object was first observed at approximately 7:00 PM EST, and was visible for approximately 15 minutes. The object was estimated to be approximately 1/4 mile in diameter and was moving in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 100-300 mph at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.

DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT(S):
The object was first observed hovering in one position and then began to move slowly in a northeasterly direction. After several minutes, the object accelerated and continued moving rapidly in the same direction until it disappeared from view.

CONCLUSIONS:
The object could not be identified as any known aircraft or phenomenon. The Air Force could not explain the nature or origin of the unidentified flying object.
