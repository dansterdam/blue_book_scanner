Wright-Patterson A.F. Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Last nite of July 1 this year I have been watching a celestial or reported UFO sighting. On that night it was approximately 11:15 when I was out of the east a large luminous object so bright it was impossible for me to look at. My special shape, I learned to know, such of way like, was lantern, and then changed course and disappeared into the north. After it turned to the north a lost some of its brightness but remained a shapeless blob. There were no blinking, alternating lights as we see on conventional airplanes, nor were there any bizarre antics which we so often read about in reports.

The enclosed clipping has led me to send this report. It was sent to me by my daughter-in-law who was visiting me at the time and watched the phenomenon at the same time. The county newspaper from Frankfort, Co. paper or the Boone, Ind. press. If there is an explanation for such a sighting, I'd be glad to hear it.

There were other reports of this kind in this general area at about the same time. There is surely some logical explanation for looking objects and we'll like very much to have one.

Very truly yours,

[Signature and name are redacted/blacked out]
