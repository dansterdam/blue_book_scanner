FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY
Washington 25, D.C.

MAY 2 1961

Major William T. Coleman, Jr., USAF
Public Information Division 
Office of Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Coleman:

Your letter dated April 7, 1961, regarding sighting of white light rotating beacons on aircraft has been forwarded to this office for reply.

Approved anti-collision lights required for night flight on aircraft having a maximum gross weight of more than 12,000 pounds and used on many lighter aircraft are red rotating beacons.

Special Civil Air Regulation SR-392B which is scheduled to terminate February 25, 1962, provides for limited experimental use of strobe lights in lighting systems which do not comply with the relevant specifications contained in the CAR.

A number of different types of lights are being evaluated by the Federal Aviation Agency Bureau of Research and Development and various operators and manufacturers. The majority of these consist of the conventional red rotating beacons with a brilliant blue-white anti-collision light. One type of installation consists of "strobe" wing-tip lights in green and "bobbing" white tail light. The descending discharge flash or the "bobbing" effect may not be distinguishable from a rotating flash as a distance, which may contain the impression that white rotating beacons have been observed.

Since approvals of experimental operation in accordance with SR-392B are granted in the field, the number and types of lights presently in operation are not readily available. 

Maintaining a current list of aircraft with experimental lighting would be impractical as it is subject to frequent changes.

If we may be of additional assistance, please advise.

Sincerely,

Jack W. Judson, Chief
Air Carrier Operations Branch
Bureau of Flight Standards

FLARES USED WITH REFUELING OPERATIONS:

SOURCE: NCOIC of REFUELING SQUADRON AT WPAFB

KC-97s carry M-4 flares for emergency use. These are used primarily when communications by radio are cut or the A/C to be refueled cannot locate the tanker A/C. The normal color is a two-ball yellow and green flare fired out of the rear of the A/C. The flare looks like a roman candle and falls in an arc descending. The duration can be up to 30 seconds. Red flares are carried also, but these are used in emergency only and not for identification of refueling operations.

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document titled "FIREBALL REPORT". The text on the page provides instructions for reporting information about fireballs or meteors to the American Meteor Society. It outlines the type of information that should be reported and emphasizes that reports should be as complete as possible in order to obtain useful scientific data.

FIREBALL REPORT

Persons observing a fireball or meteor should report the information to the American Meteor Society. The information desired is contained below. 

A very brilliant meteor or fireball which you have observed should be reported as soon as possible. It is only by the reports that you can help to those who can give personal information that any good can be done. By your prompt assistance that data can be secured for the computation of the path, and the scientific value and all reasonable efforts should be made to obtain them. You will be unable probably to answer all questions below, but answer those you can, as they may be of the greatest importance.

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Chief Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Ohio 45433

Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter of 15 November, 1965, with reference to your investigation of an unidentified flying object, I am submitting the following information:

The pilots aboard the ARMCO Steel Corporation Gulfstream G-157-A were Donald Swenson and the undersigned, who are employees of the company.

a. There were no unusual lights or other aircraft observed during the approach to the airport.
b. The time of landing was 1840 EST(2340Z).
c. The takeoff of the aircraft was from the northeast over the field after which a right turn was executed and the aircraft then proceeded westbound until entering a downwind leg on the southwesterly heading in preparation for landing to the northeast on the runway heading 052 degrees.
d. There is no afterburner used on the engines.

Insofar as there are wing tip and tail flashing strobe lights installed on the aircraft which we operated at the time, as well as top and bottom fuselage rotating beacons, we feel this might help in your investigation.

We hope that the above will be of some assistance to you.

Very truly yours,
E. E. Winglewish
Pilot

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It shows a photograph of a NASA Wallops Station facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, dated February 5, 1965.

The text in the document is as follows:

NASA Wallops Station
Wallops Island, Va.
February 5, 1965

Balloons Launched at Wallops
Routinely every morning Monday through Friday at about 8:00 a.m. we release a balloon which is about 6-feet in diameter (buff color), carrying a radiosonde (3" x 8" x 8")
on a 50-ft. string. These balloons rise until they burst (approximately 100,000 ft. altitude). There is a parachute attached to the radiosonde which brings the radiosonde back to earth after the balloon bursts. This is a meteorological balloon which collects information on temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere.

Also through the day and night whenever a rocket launching is scheduled, one of these 6-ft. balloons is launched about one hour before launch. Some purpose as above.

In connection with the rocket firings, at about T-3 hours
we launch one of these 6-ft. balloons carrying corner reflectors
covered with silver foil (instead of a radiosonde) to determine
winds aloft. These balloons may catch someone's eye occasionally
due to the bright reflectors.

For special firings such as Nike-Cajuns, Aerobees, and
Scouts, we launch little 3-ft. balloons (some buff color and
some red) as frequently as every 15 minutes during the last hour
of the countdown (no attachment to obtain data on winds
as the 6-ft. balloons). These are launched primarily
during a countdown due to holds, etc. These do not go as high
as the 6-ft. balloons.

About 90 percent of the balloons released from Wallops (and
Norfolk area also) end up over the water due to prevailing winds. 
Sometimes during the summer when prevailing winds are contrary,
a few do end up over land.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document discussing various types of rockets and their characteristics.

Some other things launched at Wallops which may be visible to the public (probably not the Norfolk area) are:

Arcas rockets which have a 15-ft. orange and white parachute to lower the payload from high altitudes in the neighborhood of 200,000 ft. Sometimes it takes 3 hours to impact in the water.

ASTRONOMICAL SIGHTINGS

101 Cases contained objects evaluated as meteors. Evaluation is performed by analysis personnel within the section on the basis of description, motion, and duration. These analytical reports are reviewed for final evaluation. These reports are then forwarded to Dr. Charles P. Oliver of the American Meteor Society for whatever action he deems advisable.

135 Cases contained objects evaluated as stars/planets. These reports are evaluated by analysis personnel within the section on the basis of the object characteristics or the motion. Again, Hynek must concur with the analysis prior to evaluation of a report.

The astronomical (other) category can best be explained by an examination of those cases evaluated and placed in this category. Some of these cases are evaluated by local astronomers having a knowledge of the particular phenomena because of the locale and atmospheric conditions. Examples: The A.F. Combat, Sub C. Moon, and a few by analysis personnel within the section and the evaluation is concurred with by Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Project Consultant). Cases of sun-dogs and parhelias are forwarded to Dr. Donald Menzel because of his particular interest in these case studies.

December 28, 1965

Major Quintanilla, 
Hq USAF, Project BLUE BOOK,
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Thank you for your letter of December 20, inviting a set of reports from Miss Ochlid. Having read them over, I am sorry to say that they were very disappointing. Nevertheless I am glad to have them for our files, and did find one or two definite sightings which were not entirely clear.

This reminds me of the time when Miss O. was doing very good lady seems well and I will send her $1.37 in hopes she can get into her car.

In the large batch of reports for the first six months of 1965, you kindly sent me, I have been going over them in detail and have come to the conclusion that while many of them may have natural causes, they are too numerous and puzzling to dismiss as such. The time of day, locations, and descriptions all seem to indicate something quite extraordinary, although of course a matter of judgment.

Altitude and azimuth data was given in some of your reports, which we checked carefully at the observatory. These also seem to indicate a pattern pointing to real objects rather than visual delusions. They help visualize what can be seen and give it a certain intelligibility.

It is a mystery to me that so many educated people can see so much on a starry night. Naturally where in the sky it started and where it ended, giving full descriptions, even to the colors, would help considerably. Every report would be valuable, but unfortunately they are not. But extensive use of diagrams should help greatly.

We are brining this to the attention of the A.F.S. in our work, and with best wishes for 1966, I am 

Sincerely yours,
Charles P. Olivier

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document discusses the history of Project Blue Book, including its investigations into public reports of "flying discs or saucers" and the Air Force's response to these reports. It mentions early correspondence indicating that the U.S. military was concerned about these reports and conducted preliminary investigations. The document also discusses a letter from Lt. General Twining of the Air Materiel Command in 1947 expressing the opinion that there was sufficient substance in the reports to warrant a detailed study.

The document then goes on to describe a letter from the Chief of Staff in 1947 directing that all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena be collected and distributed to interested government agencies. It also mentions a Technical Intelligence Division report in 1948 that analyzed previous reports and concluded that evaluation of reports of unidentified objects was a necessity for national security.

The text does not contain any photographs or images, only descriptive text about the history and investigations of Project Blue Book.

The image does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

During the phase in which Special Report #14 was in preparation (1952 - 1954) the material attracted an unusual degree of attention and interest. Subsequent Fiction publications of alleged contacts with visitors from outer space and Science Fiction publications of purported pseudo-scientific formations of purported UFO sightings. The radar sightings in Washington D.C. during July 1952 tended to substantiate the UFO reports. News coverage during this period was extremely high and General Samford conducted a press conference on 29 July 1952 to explain the situation.

With the increased volume of reports pouring in, a Scientific Advisory Panel on UFO was established in late January 1953 all available data was examined. Conclusions and recommendations of this panel were published in an unclassified report, and made public. The panel concluded that UFO's did not threaten the National Security of the U.S. and recommended that the "Myth of the flying saucer" be removed. 

By 1953 Air Force responsibility for the UFO program had become firmly established. It was not apparent that some directives were necessary in order to standardize investigative procedures and formulate policy. AFR 200-2 was written and the final publication appeared in August 1954. This regulation states the purpose, investigative procedures and policies relating to the release of information. Special Report #14 was completed on 17 March 1955. It was the product of the Scientific Advisory Panel and it was highly improbable that any of these reports represented observations of technological developments outside the range of present day scientific knowledge.  In accordance with the recommendations of the Scientific Panel and the review of information concluded in AFR 200-2 the report was declassified and released to the general public on 5 May 1955.

After 1955 the public concern with scientific UFO investigation virtually disappeared. Periodic evaluation of the data and release of information to proper news media called the "FACT SHEET". These, or similar releases have been made periodically. All data collected has been in conjunction with the conclusions of the Scientific Panel in January 1953. Still, the "Flying Saucer Myth" has persisted and many conferences and seminars have been held among the interested individuals and organizations. Among the most significant of these are: a) 8 October 1956, Incident Investigation Board Meeting, b) 6 September 1957, Defense Science Board Briefing, c) 31 January 1958, McClellan Sub-Committee Briefing, d) 8 August 1958, McCormack Sub-Committee Briefing, e) February 1959, Washington D. C. Policy Meetings and f) 11 - 15 July 1961, Congressional Briefing (Mr. Robert Smart).

As far back as 1952 recommendations have been made to discontinue the project or transfer it to civilian agencies or contractors. However, continuation of the project under Air Force auspices is likely. Letter from General Mason 7 July 1955 to General Samford expressed the view that the reliance on a contractor would not reduce the responsibility of and therefore the load carried by the Air Force. Also, various studies have been made to transfer the project to other organizations within the Air Force.

CURRENT SITUATION: Personnel associated with the project are engaged in receipt of reports, investigation, analysis, and evaluation of these reports and maintenance of research and correspondence files. In addition, information is supplied to SANOL-GS which is a reply to more than 2,000 letters a year from individuals requesting information on the UFO program. From 1966 - 1969 the files were reviewed and placed in a standard format. Periodic statistics were recomputed on the basis of the actual case files. The actual case files were revised to provide information statistics. Periodic case summaries on cases of public interest are released. The current AFR 200-2 is under revision. Present Project Officer is Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

and, to determine the technical or scientific character or identify all UFO sightings as described in paragraph 1b.

3. Responsibilities:

a. Reporting: Base commanders will report all information and evidence of UFO sightings, including information and evidence received from other services, Government agencies, and civilian sources.

b. Investigation: Investigators are authorized to direct contacts from the investigation area to the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), of the Air Force Systems Command, Dayton, Ohio, phone number water 3-7111, ext. 69216/69375). The purpose of the calls is to report high priority findings.

c. Evaluation: The commander of the Air Force unit receiving the reported UFO sighting will conduct all necessary investigation to submit a complete initial report of a UFO sighting. The initial investigation will include every effort to provide the maximum amount of information other than that closest to the scene of a reported UFO sighting will refer the incident immediately to the commander of the major air command concerned. (See paragraph 5.)

d. Analysis: The Air Force Systems Command Foreign Technology Division will analyze and evaluate.

(1) Information and evidence of reported sightings within the United States to determine the basic nature of the UFO.

(2) Information and evidence collected in EXCEPTION: The AFSEC (FTD), independent unit, regarding substantiation with pertinent Air Force Systems Command analyses for any further and continuing investigations necessary to further analyze or conclude findings.

(3) Findings: AFSEC (FTD) will prepare a final report on each sighting after collection and analysis of data, and will forward a copy of the report to USAFE (AFCIN).

The Office of Information, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, will be responsible for releasing information on sightings, and, in coordination with the AFSEC (FTD), statements to the public regarding UFO's. (See paragraphs 7 and 8.)

turn this information to the Office of Legislative Liaison for reply to the inquiry. 
(3) Process requests from congressional sources in accordance with AFR 11-7.
e. Cooperation. All Air Force activities will cooperate with Air Force, UFO investigations to insure the economical and prompt success of investigations and analysis. When feasible, this cooperation will include transportation and other assistance.

4. Guidance. The thoroughness and quality of a report of investigation of UFO's are important. Success of the investigation may depend on the person who receives the initial information and/or prepares the report. The usefulness and value of any report of investigation depend on the accuracy and timeliness of its contents. Following are aids to proper handling of UFO sightings:

a. Careful study of the logic, consistency, and coherence of the observer's report. An interview with the observer by personnel preparing the report is a means of verifying the report's source's reliability and the validity of the information received. Factors deserving particular attention are the observer's background, education, and whether his occupation involves observation reporting, or technical knowledge.
A report stating that a witness is completely reliable with certain angles of a sighting should be evaluated judiciously.
b. Theodolite measurements of changes in altitude, azimuth, and elevation and angular size.
c. Interception, identification, or air search, if appropriate and within the scope of air defense regulations.

d. When feasible, contact with local aircraft control and warning (ACW) units, and with pilots and crews of aircraft aloft at the time and location of the sighting in order to obtain corroborating evidence of verification. Contact with other persons or organizations that may have incidental data on the UFO can also be useful.
e. Consultation with military or civilian weather forecasters concerning balloons released in the area and any unusual meteorological activity which may have a bearing on the UFO.
f. Consultation with navigators and astronomers to determine whether the phenomenon could be astronomical in origin or the result of some known astronomical phenomena.
g. Contact with military and civilian tower operators, air operations units, and airlines to obtain data on any unusual activity.

SECTION B - PUBLIC RELATIONS,
INFORMATION, CONTACTS, AND
RELEASES

6. Maintaining Public Relations. The Office of
Information is responsible for:

a. In coordination with the AFSC (FTID),
maintaining contact with the public and the press on all aspects of the UFO
program and its related activities.
b. Releasing information on UFO sightings
and results of investigations.
c. Periodically releasing information on this
subject to the general public.

I do not see any photograph or image in this document. The text appears to be describing procedures and guidelines for processing, responding, and taking action on correspondence received from the public regarding UFO sightings and related matters. The text has been transcribed as follows:

AFR 200-2

d. Processing, answering, and taking action on correspondence received from the general public pertaining to the public relations, interest, and informational aspects of the subject.

7. Releasing Information. The Office of Information, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, will release to the public or official persons or agencies any information concerning UFO's, regardless of origin or nature. This includes replies to correspondence except concerning reports made by ASCS (FTD) and other Air Force activities by private individuals or organizations. The results of analyses and investigations of sightings.

8. Exceptions. In response to local inquiries re-  garding any UFO reported in the vicinity of an  Air Force base, the commander of the base concerned may release information for the general public only after positive identification as a familiar or known object. The commander must exercise care not to reveal any classified aspects of the sighting or investigation.

9. Release by Non-Air Force Sources. If news-  media sources wish to release information concern-  ing a UFO sighting, Air Force activities will make every effort to assure that the statements, figures, opinions, and allegations of persons inter-  viewed are not associated with or represented as official information. 

10. Contacts. Private individuals or organiza-  tions desiring Air Force interviews, briefings, or  any other requests to the Office of Informa-  tion, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, regarding UFO's, will not contact private individuals on UFO cases, nor will they discuss their operations unless so directed, and then only on a "need-to-  know" basis.

SECTION C - PREPARING AND SUBMITTING REPORTS

11. General Information:

a. Paragraphs 2 and 3 will serve as aids and  guidance for screening, investigations and re-  porting. Paragraph 14 contains an outline of the  current format. Attachments include planning guidance for collecting UFO data and phenomena, and  screen the information to determine whether the  report contains a valid UFO which will be defined in the provisions of this regulation.

b. To assist activities and personnel respon-  sible for handling, screening, and processing in-  formation and reports, guides to the types and sources of data and the follow-up of the general sources and types of reports.

c. Generally, initial UFO reports originate from two sources:
(1) Generally, initial UFO reports originate from two sources:
(a) Those observed by military air, marine, private, and pro-  fessional pilot-observer sources (control tower personnel, military observers, and the public in gen-  eral), by correspondence, telephone or personal contact.
(b) Military units and personnel (pilots, observers, radar operators, aircraft control and warning units, etc.) by telephone, electronic messaging, etc.

(2) Generally, UFO reports received from civil-  ian sources are of two types: 
(a) Those referring "strictly to an ob-  served UFO, containing either detailed or meager information.
(b) Those referring only in part to an  observed UFO, but primarily requesting infor-  mation on some aspect of the UFO program.

12. Methods for Transmitting Reports:

a. Together with any necessary recordings and  investigatory preparatory to reporting, report  all information on UFO's promptly. Electrical transmission with a "Priority" precedence is au-  thorized. The date of sighting. Electrically trans-  mitted reports over 3 days old should carry a "Routine" precedence.

b. Submit written reports of sightings over 3  days old on AF Form 112, "Intelligence Report."

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was the official program of the United States Air Force to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
The United States Air Force has the responsibility under the Department of Defense for the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The name of this program, which has been in existence since 1948, is Project Blue Book. It has been identified in the past as Project Sign and Project Grudge.
Air Force interest in unidentified flying objects is related directly to the Air Force responsibility for the defense of the United States. Procedures for conducting this program are established.
The objectives of Project Blue Book are two-fold: first, to determine whether UFOs pose a threat to the security of the United States; and, second, to determine whether UFOs exhibit any unique scientific or technical characteristics which could contribute to scientific research. In the course of accomplishing these objectives, Project Blue Book strives to identify and explain all UFO sightings reported to the Air Force.

HOW THE PROGRAM IS CONDUCTED
The program is conducted in three phases. The first phase includes the receipt of UFO reports and the initial investigation of the reports. The Air Force bases receive the information on a reported sighting, investigate the information, and forward it to the Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
If the initial investigation does not reveal a positive identification or explanation, a second phase of more extensive analysis is conducted by the Project Blue Book Office. Each case is carefully studied and documented to determine if sufficient data is available which could identify the UFO sighting. All personnel associated with the investigation, analysis, and evaluation of the project view each report with a scientific approach and an open mind.
The third phase of the program is dissemination of information concerning UFO sightings, evaluations, and statistics. This is accomplished by the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information.
The Air Force defines an unidentified flying object as any aerial object which the observer is unable to identify.
Reports of unfamiliar objects in the sky are submitted to the Air Force from many sources. These include military and civilian pilots, weather observers, amateur astronomers, business and professional men and women, and housewives, etc.
Phenomena reported as unidentified may include balloons, birds, aircraft, satellites, haze, aircraft navigation lights, and anticollision beacons, jet engine exhaust, condensation trails, astronomical bodies and meteorological phenomena.
(2) Insufficient data, and (3) unidentified.

and AF Form 112A, "Supplement to AF Form 112", (see paragraphs 14 and 15). However, keep the use of these forms to a minimum in reporting initial sightings. The delay offer involved in processing through channels may make followup investigation difficult, producing only limited usable data. Reporting by electrical means will eliminate this delay. If requested by the AFSCC (PFDD), AF Form 112 will provide a followup and/or complete report of all sightings initially reported.

13. Where To Submit Reports:
a. Electrical Reports. Submit multiple ad-dressed electrical reports to:
(1) Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, Colo-rado
(2) Nearest Air Division (Defense) (For United States only)
(3) Air Force Systems Command, Foreign Technology Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
(4) Headquarters, USAF (AFMIN), Wash 25 DC
(5) Secretary of the Air Force (SAFOI), Wash DC 

b. Written Reports (Basic letters and AF Form 112): 
(1) Basic Letters. Submit all letter reports direct to the AFSCC (PFDD). The AFSCC (PFDD) will provide screening and analysis of these reports, on-the-spot investigations in the United States and to the Office of Information Services of nearest Air Force base.
(2) AF Form 112. Submit original report (including sketches) within 10 days, direct to HQ USAF (AFOIX) Wash 25 DC, and a copy to AFSCC.

c. Reports from Civilians. Where possible, ad-vise civilian sources contributing reporting UFO's to submit the report, for processing and transmission, to the nearest Air Force base.

14. Basic Reporting Data and Format. Show the abbreviation "UFO" at the beginning of the report. Include the following data in the format of written reports. Include the required data in all reports, in the order shown below:

a. Description of the Object(s):

MEMORANDUM FOR MILITARY DIRECTOR, SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)

In keeping with its defense role, the Air Force has the responsibility for the investigation of unidentified flying objects reported over the United States. The name of this program is Project Blue Book...

The Air Force has conducted Project Blue Book since 1948. As of 30 June 1953, a total of 3,201 reports have been received and investigated by the Air Force...

It has been determined by the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff/Plans and Operations that Project Blue Book is a worthwhile program which discharges the Air Force mission of all unidentified flying objects investigation...

To date, the Air Force has found no evidence that any of the UFO reports so far examined are a threat to our national security.

Accordingly, it is requested that a working scientific panel composed of both physical and social scientists be organized to review Project Blue Book, its method of operations, and its findings. This panel should be asked to recommend to the Air Force any changes in the program it deems advisable.

Doctor J. Allen Hynek who is the Chairman of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University is the scientific consultant to Project Blue Book. He has indicated a willingness to work with such a panel in order to place this problem in its proper perspective.

Doctor Hynek has discussed this problem with Doctor Winston, the former Air Force Chief Scientist. The document is signed by E. B. LeBailly, Major General, USAF, Director of Information.

The document lists 3 attachments: 1. Blue Book Report, 2. Blue Book, and 3. AFR 200-2.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing types of UFO identifications and evaluations.

Identified reports are those for which sufficient specific information has been accumulated and evaluated to permit a positive identification or classification of the object.

Reports categorized as Insufficient Data are those for which one or more elements of information necessary for evaluation are missing. Some examples are the omission of the duration of the sighting or disappearance. If an element is missing and there is an indication that the sighting may be of a security, scientific, technical, or military nature, the Project Blue Book Office conducts an additional investigation and every attempt is made to obtain the information necessary for identification. However, in some instances, essential information cannot be obtained, and no further action can be taken.

The third and by far the smallest group of evaluations is categorized as Unidentified. A sighting is considered unidentified when a report apparently contains all pertinent data necessary to succeed a valid hypothesis concerning the cause or explanation of the report but the description of the object or its motion cannot be correlated with any known object or phenomenon.

The text then goes on to discuss other aspects of UFO identifications and evaluations, including satellites, aircraft, and the work of the Project Blue Book Office.

Unidentified Flying Objects: a generic term for atmospheric phenomena, detected visually or by radar, of a nature not immediately understood. The principal interest in these objects stems from the speculation that some of them are of intelligent extraterrestrial origin, and from the psychological insights into contemporary human problems which this interpretation provides.

Current popular interest in unidentified flying objects began on June 24, 1947, when a set of rapidly-moving, glistening objects were observed from the air in daytime, near Mt. Rainier, Washington, by Kenneth Arnold, a Seattle resident, who dubbed them "flying saucers." The sighting received extensive publicity, and somewhat similar sightings have been reported ever since. The diversity of these observations, however, is as striking as the observations themselves. Unidentified flying objects (or UFOs) have been described variously as rapidly-moving or hovering; disc-shaped, cigar-shaped, or ball-shaped; moving silently, or noisily; with a fiery exhaust, or with no exhaust whatsoever; accompanied by flashing lights, or uniformly glowing. A simple listing of the observations suggests that all UFOs do not share a common origin. This interpretation suggests that all UFOs do not share a common origin. In-

deed, the use of generic terms such as "UFOs" or "flying saucers" has served to confuse the issue by the implication of common origin.

Because of its air defense responsibility, the United States Air Force has undertaken to investigate all reports of unidentified flying objects over the United States. The number of sightings reported and investigated between 1947 and 1960 is shown in the accompanying Table.

Evaluation of these reports is difficult. The observations are frequently fragmentary, and reports by different observers of the same phenomenon are often dissimilar, or even irreconcilable. There is an understandable tendency for the observer to exaggerate the spectacular aspects of his observations. In many instances, statements are made concerning distance, size, and velocity which are without foundation. A small object, close by, may appear larger than a large object far away. Also, many deliberate hoaxes have been perpetrated (for example, involving double-exposure photography). After allowances are made for these possibly confusing factors, the accepted scientific procedure is to attempt an explanation of the observations in terms of natural phenomena. Only if an observation is not readily explicable in terms of known phenomena does the scientist bring to bear additional investigatory powers.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing various types of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that have been observed and reported, including unconventional aircraft, meteorological phenomena, and other high-altitude objects.

The text of the document is as follows:

introduce, ad hoc, another phenomenon in explanation.
Confirmed identifications of UFOs have been made with 
the following: unconventional aircraft; aircraft under
uncommon weather conditions; aircraft with unusual external
light patterns; meteorological and other high-altitude bal-
loons; artificial earth satellites; flocks of birds; reflec-
tions of searchlights or headlights off clouds; reflection
of sunlight from shiny surfaces; luminescent organisms, in-
cluding one case of a firefly lodged between two adjacent
panes of glass in an airplane cockpit window; optical mirages
and looming; lenticular cloud formations; ball lightning;
sundogs; meteors, including the rare green fireballs; planets,
especially Venus; bright stars; and the Aurora Borealis.
Radar detection of unidentified flying objects has also oc-
curred occasionally. Many of these sightings have been ex-
plained in terms of radar reflection off temperature inversion
layers in the atmosphere, and other sources of radar "angels."
Considering the difficulties in tracing out the visual 
and radar sightings, it is remarkable that all but about 1%
of the reported UFOs have been identified as naturally-
occurring -- if sometimes unusual -- phenomena. In October,
1957, Sputnik I, the first earth-orbiting artificial satel-
lite, was launched. Of the 1,178 sightings in that year,
701 occurred between October and December. There is a clear

implication that Sputnik and its attendant publicity was responsible for many "UFO" sightings.
In July, 1952, a set of visual and radar observations of unidentified flying objects over Washington, D.C. caused some public hysteria. Government concern was reflected in the establishment, by the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the Central Intelligence Agency, in November, 1952, of a special panel chaired by Professor H. P. Robertson, of the California Institute of Technology, to evaluate these reports. The Robertson panel thoroughly investigated the UFO reports to that date, and concluded that all were very probably natural phenomena, erroneously interpreted.
There have been strange objects seen in the sky ever since men first looked upwards. But the testimony of greatest reliability should be that of the professional astronomer. Professor J. L. Greenstein, of Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories, California Institute of Technology, has pointed out that a vehicle 100 feet in diameter, at an altitude of 50 miles, would leave a broad track on photographic plates taken of the sky with large telescopes, a track easily distinguishable from those of ordinary astronomical objects such as stars, meteors, and comets. Nevertheless, the 5,000 plates of the Palomar Sky Survey and some half-million wide-angle, fast-lens photographs taken of the sky for other purposes reveal no such tracks.

at Harvard College Observatory have never indicated the
existence of any such object.

Repeated sightings of UFOs, and the persistence of the 
Air Force and the responsible scientific community in ex-
plaining the sightings away, has suggested to some that a
conspiracy exists to conceal from the public the true nature
of the UFOs.  Might not at least a small fraction of the
residual 1% of the sightings be space vehicles of intelli-
gent extraterrestrial origin, observing the Earth and its
inhabitants?  Let us examine this possibility.

It now seems quite clear that the Earth is not the
only inhabited planet.  There is evidence that the bulk of
the stars in the sky have planetary systems.  Recent re-
search concerning the origin of life on Earth suggests that
the physical and chemical processes leading to the origin
of life occur rapidly in the early history of the majority
of planets.  The selective value of intelligence and tech-
nical civilization is so obvious, and it seems likely that a
large number of planets within our Milky Way galaxy --
perhaps as many as a million -- are inhabited by technical
civilizations in advance of our own.  Interstellar space-
flight is far beyond our present technical capabilities,
but there seem to be no fundamental physical objections to

it, and it would be very rash indeed to preclude, from our present vantage point, the possibility of its development by other civilizations. If each of, say, a million advanced technical civilizations in our galaxy launched an interstellar spacecraft per year (and even for an advanced civilization, the launching of an interstellar space vehicle will not be a trivial undertaking), and even if all stars in the galaxy can be explored with equal facility, then our solar system should, on the average, be visited only once every hundred thousand years.

UFO enthusiasts have sometimes castigated the skeptic for anthropocentrism. Actually, the view that the Earth is daily visited by interstellar spacecraft is far more anthropocentric. If even a small fraction of the residual UFOs are interstellar in origin, this would imply an overriding significance to our small planet; as if all the professional anthropologists in the world converged on one of the Andaman Islands because the fishnet had recently been invented there. Anthropologists have other interests. Only a few specialize in the cultures of the Andaman Islands. If our views on the frequency of intelligence in the galaxy are correct, there is no reason for the Earth to be singled out for interstellar visits. A somewhat greater frequency of visits

could be expected if there were another intelligent civilization within our own solar system, but at the present time there is no evidence for the existence of such a civilization on Mars or on any other nearby planet.

Related to the UFO report is the contact tale, a contemporary report of the landing of an extraterrestrial space vehicle on Earth. Unlike the UFO descriptions, these tales display a striking uniformity. The extraterrestrials are described as humanoid, differing from us only in some small characteristic such as teeth, speech, or dress. The aliens -- so the "contactees" report -- have been observing Earth and its inhabitants for many years, and express concern at "the present grave political situation." They are fearful that, left to our own devices, we will destroy our civilization. The contactee is then selected as their "chosen intermediary" with the governments and inhabitants of Earth (The contactee's qualifications for this position are not always evident.). He is taken on voyages in the spacecraft, sometimes to the visitors' home planets, but somehow the promised political or social intervention never materializes.
C. G. Jung has pointed out that the frequency and persistence of these contact tales -- not one of which has been confirmed by the slightest objective evidence -- must be of considerable psychological significance.

Substantial psychological significance. What need is fulfilled by a belief that unidentified flying objects are of extraterrestrial origin? It is noteworthy that in the contact tales, the spacecraft and their crews are never reported to be hostile. It would be very satisfying if a race of advanced and benign creatures were devoted to our welfare. The interest in unidentified flying objects derives, perhaps, not so much from scientific curiosity as from unfulfilled religious needs. Flying saucers serve, for some, to replace the gods that science -- for good or otherwise -- has deposed. The old mythological frameworks have evaporated, but, with their reports of distant and exotic worlds and their pseudo-scientific overlay, the contact accounts are acceptable to many people. These tales, and their attendant ritual, comprise one of the few viable contemporary cult movements of more than passing interest and local relevance. But precisely because people desire so intensely that unidentified flying objects be of benign, intelligent, and extraterrestrial origin, honesty requires that, in evaluating the observations, we accept only the most rigorous logic and the most convincing evidence.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing aircraft evaluations and related information. The text is as follows:

AIRCRAFT

Aircraft evaluations are made on the basis of description and flight characteristics. As the priority on the report is attributable to aircraft no object is observed and the evaluation is made primarily on the time-motion sequence. The lighting and visual characteristics as well as the time motion sequence may differ with the type of aircraft and/or its mission. Initial lighting observations are maintained for full identification and are considered in the ACIG portion of the section with maps showing low and high level air corridors and flight restricted areas. They also pulling the "flight planning guide" which lists all refueling areas and their control agency. Special low-level military training areas are included in this publication and a map showing the routes is distributed periodically. ADD provides support on aircraft lighting configuration and the flight requirements stipulated. The QUAD crew at WRAFB provides information of visual characteristics of night refueling operations. SAC is closely photographed a refueling mission so that the visual characteristics of a refueling operation might be observed by analysis personnel. Civilian and military segments known to be engaged in night photography are contacted in cases of suspected photographic missions. NO cases in which an A/C flight is visualized at low altitudes or with the reported maneuvers are not consistent with known aircraft flight.

CONVENTIONAL
a) Regular scheduled airliners - Fly in air corridors, and are usually controlled by FAA. Lighting will probably be typical red and green wing
lights with rotating beacon. Landing lights on. Used landing lights on approach and takeoff, may include period of time reported as hovering or stationary if the aircraft is in a turn or approaching the observer. Not likely that duration will exceed 5 s or unless some grades of maneuvers is being performed. Most often reported at night and reported as single light (landing light) blots on time and given duration if lighting configuration are not readily distinguishable. The lighting configuration of each aircraft is included in the aircraft characteristics and can be red. Those objects in straight flight at altitude can be checked against local flight schedules. FAA can be checked if there is some doubt that the object is an aircraft or if positive identification as to a specific flight is required. May or may not have sound associated with the report. If near an airport, this type of object is not regarded as a UFO since moving lights in and around airports which could be caused by aircraft are regarded as airtraffic.

- page 60 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing various types of UFO-related phenomena, such as balloons, satellites, and other objects that are not considered unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text extracted from the document:

Balloons continue to be reported as UFOs. Several thousand balloons are released each day from military and civilian airports, weather stations, and research activities. There are several types of balloons - weather balloons, communications balloons, and the large research balloons which have diameters up to 300 feet. At night, balloons carry running lights which cause an unusual appearance when observed. Reflection of the sun on balloons at dawn and sunset sometimes produces strange effects and distortions before the sun.  These balloons can move at speeds of over 100 miles per hour when moving in high altitude jet windstreams. These balloons sometimes appear to be stationary or to have lights mounted inside the bag itself due to the sun's rays reflecting through the material of the balloon. The Balloon Control Center at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, maintains a continuous around-the-clock surveillance of all balloon operations in the continental United States.  

Another category of UFO evaluations labeled Other includes missiles, reflections, mirages, searchlights, birds, kites, spurious radar indications, hoaxes, fireworks, and flares. Aircraft, satellites, balloons, and the like should NOT be reported since they do not fall within the definition of an unidentified flying object.

- page 61 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, that describes various characteristics of jet aircraft and special low-level missions.

b) Private or non-scheduled flights - Same characteristics as conventional airliner. Speeds of light aircraft may be slower and the duration longer. Usually at lower altitudes. Sound will not be heard if the wind is blowing a certain way. Normal flight is VFR from some local airport. Not carried on flight clearance. Hardest type to check for positive identification. Evaluation made on flight characteristics.

JET AIRCRAFT
a) Visual characteristics depend upon the type of mission:
e) Airliner and high altitude missions - Characteristics are similar to conventional flights with the following exceptions: (1) The color is most often reported as red. (2) The sound is associated with the object. (3) Flight is usually straight or with one turn. Duration is about 3-5 minutes depending upon the degree of maneuver performed.
b) Special low level missions (military) - Mission flown at 2,000 ft. in known air corridors. Sighting is usually brief (one minute or less). Sight of an object which may appear to be hovering if the approach is directly toward the observer. May include a sudden burst of speed. No sound wind may carry sound away from observer. More than one flight may be involved. Flights are normally performed at night. These aircraft are not mis-interpreted during the day since wings, tail, and/or other features can be noted. (Simple route assumed)
c) Special tests or training missions - Characteristics will depend on the number of A/C, formation, type of A/C, etc. Can vary from a single A/C to multiple formations. These flights can be determined by contact with local, regional, or major air commands.
d) Jet with afterburner - Afterburner operation viewed from the side may give the appearance of a short flame. Color usually reported as blue, but size and character may be reported as disappearing completely or the witness may believe that the object passed off into space. Duration usually brief. Object frequently in a climb. As viewed from the rear as the object is going away from the observer the color reported may be red or orange with some yellow and blue.

REFUELING MISSIONS
Differ from other missions in that lights on the tanker and multiple A/C engaged in the operation add visual characteristics not normally associated with aircraft flight. Reports are flight time only since daylight operations can be recognized by the observer. May be both low and high altitude refueling missions involve multiple lights moving around, in formation. Flight of the basic tanker formation will be straight and steady. Lights in an area may run as high as 15 minutes but each observed a single pass and require not much more than 1-2 minutes. Lights may appear going one way then appear on their return path at a later time. Operations are controlled and scheduled is conducted in specific areas. The location of these areas and the agency to contact for use are specific cases. Tankers engaged in this operation will provide information as to the exact nature of the missions, how long they will last, and new schedules maintained.
a) A/C using flare drops--More often reported as flares rather than A/C engaged in photo work.
b) A/C using strobes for illuminating the target. Can be low level or high altitude missions. Only the strobe light is visible and the A/C is reported as a source of slowly spaced flashes.
c) Infra Red--These aircraft are specially equipped with turbine generators to drive the equipment. The generator makes a noise similar to a whine and can be heard above the noise of the aircraft. Many are on classified projects and the agencies doing this work are limited. The A/C utilized are relatively slow, sound will be associated with the object and the landing lights are used because of the low altitudes flown. The A/C will be low, sound will be associated with the object and the landing lights should be observed. No portion of the infra red equipment will be observed.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is as follows:

ADVERTISING AIRCRAFT
Fall basically into two types:
a) Those targets or banners of some sort visible during daylight hours. Those are not usually misinterpreted unless the aircraft remains as a result for the observer to see only outlines and not details of the plane and sign being towed. Frequently reports are accompanied by drawings or photos assumed to be a part of the object viewed and generally marked by maneuvers. Frequently loud speakers are utilized but when heard the A/C should be within range identification as a known object. Local investigators can check for these aircraft since FAA regulations require that a permanent record be obtained for those flights.
b) Electrical lighted signs - Same essential characteristics except that they are usually viewed at night. On occasions there signs have been regarded as windows of a much larger craft. Flights again are relatively slow and maneuvering back and forth in one area is characteristic of the flight. An aircraft usually operates in an area for more than one day and can be viewed on successive nights, weather permitting.
HELICOPTERS
Motion slow. Flight may or may not include hovering. Should be far enough away from the observer that positive identification cannot be made during the day. May be reported as a black speck moving back and forth, up and down, etc. During the night when effect can be obtained from the red rotating beacon flashing through the canopy. Again motion will be erratic if the flight includes hovering. Positive identification usually simple to obtain by checking the flight schedules of military and civilian helicopters in the area.

CONCLUSIONS

To date, the firm conclusions of Project Blue Book are: (1) no unidentified flying object reported, investigated and evaluated by the Air Force has ever proven to be a threat to our national security; (2) there is no evidence that sightings categorized as unidentified represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge; and (3) there has been no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified are extraterrestrial vehicles.

The Air Force will continue to investigate all reports of unusual aerial phenomena over the United States. The services of qualified scientists and technicians will continue to be used to investigate and analyze these reports, and periodic reports on the subject will be made.

The former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Carl Vinson, recently commented on the conduct of the UFO program by the Air Force and stated that Congressional hearings on this subject are unnecessary.

The Air Force does not deny the possibility that some form of life may exist on other planets in the universe. However, it does state, the Air Force has concluded nor discovered any evidence which tends to indicate that aerial phenomena exist which are beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge. The Air Force continues to maintain an open invitation to anyone who feels that he possesses any evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles operating within the earth's near space environment. The address for this purpose is through the following address:

PROJECT BLUE BOOK INFORMATION OFFICE
SAFOI
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20330

Anyone observing what he considers to be an unidentified flying object should report it to the nearest Air Force Base. Persons submitting a UFO report to the Air Force are free to discuss any aspect of the report with anyone. The Air Force does not seek to limit discussion on such reports and does not withhold or censor any information pertaining to this unidentified program.

Dear Sir,

The object that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-
Patterson AFB was tested at the Air Technical Intelligence
Center. A report on the test results is attached. While no
identifiable evidence or the object was found, tests con-
ducted indicate the object was of unknown origin and
did not exhibit evidence of space residence. The sphere
is being returned to you under separate cover.

In expressing your patriotic duty as an American citizen in
submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.

Sincerely,

ATTN OF: MAAF (W. P. Conrady)

SUBJECT: Analysis of Metallic Sphere

TO: TDEW (Sgt Moody)

1. On 17 Feb 1965 Sgt Moody of the FTD delivered a metallic sphere to the Materials Engineering Division for analysis. Examination of this sphere is as follows:

a. Consists of two hemispheres held together with 4 set-screws.

b. Approximately 9" in diameter (OD).

c. Weighs 23.99 pounds.

d. Wall thickness approximately 1".

e. Density is such that it would readily sink in water.

f. Sphere is an aluminum (195 casting alloy) casting that has been machined and polished. External finish was a black paint. Set screws are steel, 1/4 diameter; 28 threads per inch with Allen wrench head fittings, recognized as Standard American. Steel alloy is of the 4130 series type.

g. This container was apparently designed for compressive loads. The design is such that it would not be suitable for internal gas pressures because of the relatively weak method of closure.

h. There are no external connections, hooks, eyes, entry ports or markings other than the machining tool marks.

i. There is evidence that a gasket had been used at the closure flange although no gasket material remained.

MATERIALS. THE KEY TO AEROSPACE PROGRESS

- page 77 -

The image contains text but no photograph. I will now act as an OCR system and output the text from the document:

3. Internal surfaces are severely corroded, indicating a more corrosive environment internally. The lack of corrosion on the outside (even though paint was removed) indicates a less corrosive environment for very long. Analysis of the corrosion products did not provide any clue to the possible contents.

4. A survey for residual alpha, beta or gamma radiation was negative.

2. Discussion.

We have not been able to establish the intended use of this device. The following possible applications were considered but not confirmed:

The design was considered as a waste disposal container for radioactive materials. However, it would not be an efficient container from a payload point of view since only half (one hemisphere) could be loaded. Nonetheless, it was found that this was not comparable to any radioactive waste containers they have handled.

Wave and blast protective shell for instrumentation exposed to shock wave and blast pressures. Samples were obtained which showed sufficient strength to withstand something like the one now under consideration. In support of atomic tests in Nevada. However, the process of manufacture and the materials used did not indicate that this was the type used by them.

For a portable submersible test device. Not a likely application since there are no external connections for anything, and additional tests are contemplated without further instructions from your office.

The image does not contain a photograph, it is a page from an old UFO report document. The text describes an alleged incident of a vehicle from outer space landing near Brooksville, Florida on March 5, 1965. The report discusses details about the alleged spacecraft, including its speed, landing gear, and the papers reportedly dropped by an occupant. The text also mentions an analysis of the papers by the Institute of Paper Chemistry in Appleton, Wisconsin.

AIR FORCE STATEMENT ON BROOKSVILLE, FLORIDA, UFO SIGHTING, 2 MARCH 1966
The alleged landing of a vehicle from outer space at Brooksville, Florida, on 5 March 1965, was apparently a hoax according to information obtained by Air Force investigators from BROOKVILLE AFB, Florida, and Dr. G. W. Bemiss, Pan American Airways technical staff member of the Eastern Test Range, who conducted an additional investigation. The report submitted to the Air Force investigators by the alleged eyewitness contained several statements which cannot be confirmed as facts. The spacecraft allegedly took off straight up at 5000 miles per hour and was out of sight in ten seconds. It is extremely doubtful that a twenty to thirty-foot object could have been seen for more than five seconds at which time the object would have reached an altitude of 36,430 feet. The blast-off from a vehicle taking off at this speed would have disturbed the sand and soil in the immediate area. There was no evidence of any abnormal disturbance in the area. The sketch of the alleged spacecraft showed four still poles as the landing gear. These poles protruded from the spacecraft at an angle. The holes which were purportedly caused by the landing gear were distinct and appeared to have been scoped or dug as opposed to indentations caused by an object of any sizeable weight. There was no radioactivity in the area. Two papers which contained unreadable hieroglyphics were reportedly dropped by an occupant of the spacecraft. An analysis was made of these papers by the Institute of Paper Chemistry in Appleton, Wisconsin. This analysis indicated that the paper is composed of fibers which are common worldwide. The fiber composition corresponds to that used in lens and optical papers. The hieroglyphics on one of the papers was deciphered by means of simple substitution and was determined to be the work of an amateur.

Reads as follows: "Planet Mars - Are you coming home soon - We miss you very much - Why did you stay away too long". Since no other implications were apparent, it was not feasible for the Air Force to expend further time and money in deciphering the second sheet: Based on the above, it is the opinion of the Air Force that an attempt was made to perpetrate a hoax.

The shared image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report on a UFO sighting. While there is no photograph present, the text describes an encounter with what the witness perceived to be a "robot-type creature" that was seen by a longshoreman named John P. Reeves. The text provides details about the encounter, including the creature's appearance and the witness's reaction. It also mentions that the team will send the report to the Bluebook staff at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation.

Man Recounts Run-In With 'Saucer Robot'
BROCKSVILLE, OH - It made a "whistling noise" and was about 5 1/2 feet in height or even taller, retired longshoreman John P. Reeves said yesterday in describing a bizarre incident he claims to have stumbled onto in the Brocksville area.
Reeves, who admits to being "past 69," told a story of a being or creature that appeared to take his picture. 
REEVES, WHO LIVES ALONE at a trailer park's mobile home unit, said the incident occurred at mid-afternoon on Wednesday as he was walking along Highway 20 about 700 yards from his residence.
"I saw the object when the robot-type creature appeared and walked toward me," Reeves said. "It was blush-green and reddish-purple in color with two pieces of cloth-like paper as it headed back to the saucer."
Reeves said the creature flashed a third time and then rushed back to the saucer, which had remained about 100 feet away. "THEY WERE FROM outer space," he said. The team said the creature's actions were more like those of a "moving machine, some blinking open and shut." 
Reeves said the team started circling and rushing, then started straight up. It was out of sight in 10 seconds.
The two pieces of paper were turned over to an investigator. The team said the Air Force would be notified of the incident for further investigation.

NON AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS
The following items are for internal use only and are not available for distribution to the public. These concern internal management and procedures for forwarding UFO reports to the appropriate agency:
1. Air Force Regulation 200-2
2. JANAP 146
The Air Force has no films, photographs, maps, charts, or graphs of unidentified flying objects. Photographs that have been submitted for evaluation in connection with UFO reports have been determined to be a misinterpretation of natural or conventional objects. These objects have a positive identification.
The Air Force no longer possesses, and thus does not have for distribution, outdated reports on Project Sign, Project Grudge, Blue Book Special Report No. 14, and outdated Project Blue Book press releases. Non-military UFO publications should be requested from the publisher, not the Air Force.

Your Ref: TDEW/UFO 

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The following summarizes our analyses, interpretations, and suggestions on the specimen submitted to us recently by Major Quintanilla. This is the material allegedly dropped by a visitor from outer space. Much of this information was reported previously but is included and supplemented here for the sake of completeness. We have divided our comments into several categories.

1. Composition of Fiber

The sample is composed of plant fibers from the bark or the leaf of one or more of a number of plants. A wide variety of plants of this general type grow in this country and abroad, and some species are not distinguishable from one another in fiber form. Of the more common ones, we believe the sample contains types resembling fiber from the following: cotton, ramie; it could be fiber from abaca, sisal, kozo, hemp, or a similar but less common plant.

Exhibit A includes photomicrographs showing botanical similarities of fibers from the unknown sample and from two known reference materials. It also includes photomicrographs from our files of a number of known fibers maintained as reference materials for the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry.

- page 84 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text from the document:

Although the United States paper industry is based principally on fibers derived from trees, the use of bast or leaf fibers in this country and in foreign countries is not uncommon, and we see no reason to believe that these fibers have any unusual origin. In foreign countries, such fibers are grown specifically for papermaking; this practice is not as common in this country, but such fibers can be imported for papermaking or can be (and are) obtained from waste cordage, and similar products containing fibers of this type.

2. Paper Identification

The sample itself is of the type used for lens paper or stencil tissue (sometimes called Japanese tissue). The sample submitted had a basis weight of 5.5 lbs. (for a ream of 500 sheets, 24 x 36 inches), a thickness of approximately 0.0013 inches and was soft, bulky and of open structure. Formation was very uniform, indicating a high quality operation. There was no evidence of any special treatment to impart water repellency or wet strength.

3. Possible Origin

Of the samples which were readily available to us for comparison, one approximating the unknown sample quite closely was taken from "Papercraft 1969" published by Japanese Paper Import Co., and identified as "Machine-made Tengujo (Stencil) Paper" was essentially indistinguishable from the unknown. Where the samples are identified as "machine-made" it is quite probable that similar materials are available in various commercial channels, or possibly as souvenirs brought from foreign country by an individual. Similar papers also manufactured in this country by a number of mills, and to our knowledge, could be manufactured by these mills but we do not know whether they actually make such materials at the present time.

A second sample similar to the unknown, identified as "Speed-O-Print Carbon Ribbon Sheet No. 700", is used with mimeograph stencils and obtained from a local stationery supply house, but we do not know whether it is imported or an item of domestic manufacture.

Exhibit B includes transmitted light photographs at approximately 3.5 diameters magnification, showing similarities in structure between the unknown, the Japanese tissue and the commercial stencil tissue.

Exhibit C includes specimens of the two commercial papers for comparison with the unknown.

4. Suggestions for Further Exploration
In case additional information on the possible availability or the actual history of the specific sample is desired by the Air Force, or by some other appropriate agency, we suggest the following contacts:

A. Domestic Paper Manufacturers
There are several companies in this country which are capable of making products very similar to the unknown. We feel that discussion with these companies, including an opportunity for them to examine the sample, may be helpful to determine whether or not any of these companies do, in fact, manufacture a product identical to the unknown. Companies active in this particular segment of the paper industry would be able to comment on the present status of domestic production versus imports of products of this type and the probable channels of distribution. For primary contacts we suggest the following:

John A. Manning Paper Co., Inc., P. O. Box 328, Troy,
New York (C. E. Lanyon)
C. H. Dexter & Sons, Inc., 100 Canal St., Windsor Locks,
Conn. (Geo. D. Knight)
Crystal Tissue Co., Middletown, Ohio
Peter J. Schweitzer Division of Kimberly-Clark Corporation, 230 Park Avenue, New York, New York Delsta Paper Operations Division, Celotex Insulation Division, Pisgah Forest, North Carolina

In turn, discussion with each of these companies may develop further contacts worth investigating.

B. Users and/or Distributors
At least two types of organizations would be interested in handling papers comparable to the unknown: for lens tissue and for use as stencil tissue. We suggest that the following be contacted as converters or distributors of paper for lens tissue:

THE INSTITUTE OF PAPER CHEMISTRY

Among the companies handling mimeograph supplies, we 
suggest the following be contacted for information on 
their sources of supply (whether domestic or imported)
and on methods of distribution:

A. B. Dick Company, 5700 W. Touhy Avenue, Chicago, 
Illinois
Speed-O-Print Business Machines Company, 1801 W.

In addition we have recently received 
Beautiful for November, 1964) suggesting
various papers for art work and noting 
Japanese papers is available from:

Craft Studios, 118 Evans St., New Hyde Park, New York

C. Importers

In addition to general importers or specific contacts 
developed as a result of the above discussions, the 
following may be able to contribute useful information:

Nelson-Whitehead Company, New York, New York

This company is listed as a sales agent for 
one of the Japanese manufacturers of hand-
made paper but we have been unable to 
locate a New York address for them. It is 
possible that the firm has been reorganized 
since the information of the directory in which 
it appeared. The following companies 
listed as paper merchants in the New York 
area, might or might not be related to this 
possible contact:

A. C. Neilson Paper Company, Inc., 420 W. 
Broadway, New York 12, New York
Whitehead and Alliger Company, Inc., 
11 Thomas St., New York 7, New York

The following is an importer of various materials

Further Speculation
We have made no chemical analysis of the markings and do not
intend to do so. In my previous letter I attempted to suggest the possibility
that the markings were placed upon the paper by stamping or printing rather than by an instrument such as a pencil,
which would tend to disrupt the fiber structure. Some of
my colleagues feel that this, the markings could have been made
with a special type of pencil used in photographic touchup
work and graphic arts processes. One example is
the MARS-Lumograph Dz, available thru J. S. Staedtler in this country.
Further speculation about the nature of the markings brought
out the comment that these markings appear to have been made
by a person with skilled hand and confidence in his ability.
Someone who was painstakingly and hesitatingly following a set pattern with
no previous experience. This again suggests the possibility
that a commercial artist, or someone with similar skills,
may have been involved in preparation of the coded message,
either for the incident under consideration or for some
previous occasion.
If there is any way in which we can be of further assistance to the Air Force
or to any agency investigating related aspects, please feel free to call
on us.

1. (U) The following information is the result of an investigation conducted by Captain John F. Lorincy, Combat Intelligence, Intelligence Division, 433rd Bombardment Wing (M), on 26 and 27 August 1965. According to the witness interviewed in accordance with AFR 200-2, the following concerning an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO):

2. (U) Description of the object: Nine (9) light blue plastic bags approximately 36 inches in length, each bearing the inscription "WARNING! DO NOT REMOVE THE AIR! THIS BAG WILL ALLOW HEAT TO ESCAPE!" These bags were found in a field near where a mercury type battery wired to a flashlight type bulb, #605, by two wires, number X-233 and X-232, indicating the battery and bulb were in place of cellophane colored blue, orange, green and purple. The plastic bags appear to be the type utilized by commercial cleaning establishments to enclose clothes for customers.

3. (U) Investigation information: Mr Jack E. Page, 1949 Stubblefield Road, Fayetteville, Arkansas, age 50, self-employed Asphalt Broker, reported observing the UFO approximately 0255L hours, on 24 August 1965. He had just arisen from bed and saw the object in a field approximately 150 yards back of his house. He estimated the wind to be very light, from a northeasterly direction at the time of first seeing the object. Mr Page took the UFO to Mr Glenn Diston, Chief of the Little Rock AFB Security Office. Subsequently Mr Eates was interviewed by a reporter from the Northwest Times newspaper of Fayetteville, Arkansas. The UFO received extensive press coverage in the Northwest Times plus TV coverage in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Weather conditions at Fayetteville, Arkansas during the period from 2200L, 23 August to 0800L, 24 August 1965:
a. Wind - Surface calm until 0800L, 24 August

that a man,

Harold Karnes
1/2 29th Street
Reno, Pennsylvania 677-5235 (Code 814 through Oil City)

and his wife had been painting a house when the object dropped near them.
It frightened them, and they left the scene, returning later to find
an object roughly the size and shape of a child's football. It is
apparently hollow with rubbery walls approximately 1/16 inch thick.
It was cracked, but all pieces were recovered. This is near Oil City,
Pennsylvania.
Mr Karnes reported this to the:
652 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron, Oakdale, Pennsylvania
and they are waiting to pick up this object for delivery to FTD if this
is desired. They are going to wait for a call from FTD.

MEMO FOR RECORD:
On 7 October Major Quintanilla went TDY to Pennsylvania and obtained the object
from Mr Karnes. Object was a found of some sort, not a meteor.

TO: Hq USAF SAFQIC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the balloon which was recovered at Vero Beach, Florida. It can be identified that this balloon was manufactured by the G T Schjeldahl Company, Northfield, Minnesota. This particular balloon was previously launched from Cape Kennedy, not prior to the Gemini G mission. The Schjeldahl Company has supplied approximately 1,500 of these balloons for use in the Marshall Space Center for atmospheric sounding. More detailed information on temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere prior to a launch. At times, some of these balloons are launched as frequently as every five minutes during the last hour of the countdown in order to obtain data on wind direction and velocity. Most of these balloons would probably end up over the water due to the prevailing winds.

1. Reference Telecon between Sgt Moody and Maj Fernandez on 25 October 1965 in which further information was requested on the identification and return of the balloon.

2. After notifying FTD (UPO) on 21 October 1965 that the object would be
sent to them for identification, we received a phone call from Mr. Robert
Laddie, Washington representative of the G.T.E.Sylvania Co. of Northfield
Minn. From our description, Mr. Laddie identified the object as a test
balloon manufactured by the Echosphere Co. He requested we return the balloon to him as soon as possible since the item was valuable and we did not need it for further identification.

3. On 22 October we received a call from Mr. Bob Long of NASA Operations,
who stated that NASA had launched similar ones manufactured by the Schia-parelli Co. as a check on the data for the 20 October launch conducted the
day before. He stated the only way to be certain of the identification was
to have the balloon delivered to NASA on Monday or Tuesday of the following week.

4. Further information on the return and ownership of the balloon can be
obtained by calling Mr. Bob Long at NASA, Wallops Island Station, VA. Phone

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of text describing an unidentified inflatable, object that was sighted near Dover, Delaware on October 25, 1955.

According to the text, the object was reported to be approximately 15-20 feet long and white in color. It was described as a "mysterious" and "unidentified" object. The text discusses how the object was detected by radar and that Air Force officials from Dover Air Force Base were investigating the incident. The text also mentions that the object did not appear to include a "primary target" or "device for guiding radar", and that it was made of some kind of material, possibly aluminum, and was partially inflated.

- page 109 -

The image appears to contain a newspaper clipping with text and no photograph. The text describes an incident involving a "strange object called balloon" that was observed descending from the sky in Snow Hill, Maryland. The object was initially thought to be a weather balloon, but it was eventually determined to be a "mystery deflated" object. The text also mentions that the object was the subject of an investigation by the Washington office of the U.S. Air Force.

Morning News, Wilmington, Del.
Fri., Oct. 22, 1965

Strange object called balloon

Md. mystery deflated

SNOW HILL, Md. - The object which fell from the sky behind a Snow Hill, Md., hatchery Wednesday afternoon may be a weather balloon, a spokesman for the hatchery said last night.

Robert Ledd, manager of the Washington office of the U.S. Air Force in Rockville, Md., said he based his theory on a description of the find—an inflatable, winged object 12 to 14 feet long, with a diameter of 8 to 10 feet. Ledd said he would conduct an investigation at once.

MRS. George Hopkins, owner of the hatchery, said the object descended at the rear of her building. The markings on the object were SSV and the name of the company.

It was entirely with foil vanes, Mrs. Hopkins said. Four of these appeared designed to propel it, she added.

MRS. Hopkins said heat apparently vaporized automatically to cause the thing to expand and when it was carried into the hatchery office it quickly deflated to the size of a softball.

A team from the Dover Air Force Base picked up the object and returned it to the base. A base spokesman said it was taken to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for possible identification.

Representatives of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Wallops Island, Va., said it did not originate there.

Scheidahl was the firm that produced the Echo I satellite which cut a brilliant trail through the skies in 1960. LEDD said Scheidahl balloons are used in tests at Wallops Island and also are used by the Army in tests in the Washington-Virginia area.

"It's entirely possible one of them got loose," Ledd said. "Balloons of various types are used over a period of time in various tests in this country all the time," he said.

MRS. HOPKINS said the object resembled aluminum.

Throughout Wednesday afternoon and night scores of persons flocked to the scene to view the object before it was removed. MRS. Hopkins said many theories were expressed about its origin and size, the most prevalent being that it was a gunnery target or a device for training radar operators.

Text from the document:

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

January 13, 1966

Major Hector Quintanilla USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
DAYTON, OHIO 45433

Dear Major:

This is to report to you that Sergeant Moody and I are hard
at it for these three days. I think that we will be able to clean
up all of 1965.

As I go over the 900 or so cases of '65, I am once again impressed by the inadequate quality of the data upon which the evaluations must be based. In some cases the "even infufficient data" is
really a misnomer; there is enough data but it is of such poor quality
that the meaning of the anything is indefinable rather than unidentified. To use the category "insufficient data" overly much weights
the statistics so that one's vision may be blurred. There is just a handy
catch-all to which we put unsatisfactory cases that I find a ready explanation for. On the other hand, to say the case is "unidentified"
is even worse because this is interpreted by many as saying that some
mean that something really mysterious is going on. The reason for
its being unidentified is not that the data do not permit any logical
explanation. I would prefer the term "unidentifiable" or, better,
"unidentifiab'le because of poor data" to either of the terms "unidentified" or "insufficient data". I rather agree with public opinion that
the term "unidentified" should be reserved for those cases which really do puzzle us even though we have, reasonably good data, by which I mean largely that there was more than one
observer, and that we have some single-agency sequence of the reported
events.

Should there ever be any official inquiry from the Pentagon
about the conduct of our Project, I think it might be well to bring
up the above points. I have for years, as you know, pleaded for
immediate capability in the gathering of data so that evaluations
could be placed on a much firmer foundation than they have been in
the past. The chances of ever uncovering what really lies behind
some of these cases are slim because of the inadequate way of evaluating
which is simply because of the inherent paucity of the data.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen
Director

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory 
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The information which you requested regarding satellites with visual magnitudes of 3.0 or brighter is given below. All are orbiting as on this date. Many of the satellites mentioned in 1965,
however, have magnitudes fainter than 3.0 and thus for those objects, the magnitudes are to be considered less reliable.
