10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
To visual sighting. Picked up by ground radar. Speed of about 72 kts to E. Altitude of approx 17,000 ft. 2 F-100 a/c concerned and picked up object on their radar and look-on obtained for several passes. No visible contact. Observed by 10 military personnel on ground radar. Picked up by both airborne radars. Plt at 47,000 ft was from heading of 240° at 90 kts. No inversion in area. Tropopause at 35,000. All other weather normal at altitude.

11. COMMENTS
Particle object picked up on 3 separate radars. Only remote possibility of weather or the cause. Believed to be solid object by radar analyst. Wind would carry balloon released from Loring AFB, Maine at 0000 to the above location. Fairly indication or slight leak would cause balloon to level off at 17,000 ft instead of usual maxima altitude. Speed of object together with the wind direction indicates a lighter-than-air object. Also no visible identification indicates that balloon was probably cause.

□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon

SUBJ: UFO. THIS MESSAGE IS IN 10 PARTS. PART I. DESCRIPTION OF
OBJECT: ONE OBJECT DETECTED BY AIR DEFENSE RADAR. NO VISUAL SIGHTING.
SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR UNKNOWN. PART II. DESCRIPTION OF COURSE:
THE OBJECT WAS INITIALLY OBSERVED AS A RADAR RETURN WITH A MEASURED
HEIGHT OF 47 THOUSAND FEET. LOCATION WAS 112 NAUTICAL MILES SSE
OF MELVILLE AS, LABRADOR. (51 DEGREES, 42 MINUTES NORTH; 59 DEGREES,
10 MINUTES WEST). RADAR CONTACT WAS MAINTAINED FOR 1 HOUR AND 54
MINUTES. THE OBJECT MOVED GENERALLY EASTERLY AT 72 KNOTS. IT FAD-
ED AT 52 DEGREES, 10 MINUTES NORTH; 56 DEGREES, 12 MINUTES WEST

(175 NAUTICAL MILES ESE OF MELVILLE). PART III. MANNER OF OBSERV-
TION: THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY GROUND ELECTRONICS (FPS 20 AND FPS
6D) AND AIRBORNE FIRE CONTROL RADAR (MG10). PART IV. DATE AND TIME:
INITIALLY DETECTED 02/0532Z APRIL. FADED AT 02/0724Z APRIL. PART V.
LOCATION OF OBSERVERS: MELVILLE AIR STATION, LABRADOR. PART VI.
OBJECT OBSERVED ON RADAR BY APPROXIMATELY TEN MILITARY PERSONNEL ON
DUTY IN THE 641ST ACRON OPERATIONS. THE SENIOR DIRECTOR WAS 1ST LT
GEORGE W MCKELLAR, A03097153. ALL OBSERVERS CONSIDERED RELIABLE
BEYOND DOUBT. PART VII. WINDS AND WEATHER: ALL WEATHER VALUES
QUOTED ARE ESTIMATES, DUE TO THE LACK OF REPORTING STATION IN THE
AREA OF SIGHTING. SURFACE - 090/10 6000 FEET - 240/40
10000 FEET - 240/60 16000 FEET - 240/70 20000 FEET - 240/70
30000 FEET - 230/120 40-47000 FEET - 240/90 50000 FEET - 250/60
80000 FEET - 230/20. CEILING: ONE THOUSAND FEET OVERCAST WITH LAY-
ERED CLOUDS ABOVE. ESTIMATED TOPS 30000 FEET WITH HIGH THIN
SCATTERED ABOVE. VISIBILITY TWO TO THREE MILES IN SNOW, RAIN AND
FOG. NO THUNDERSTORMS IN AREA. NORMAL TEMPERATURE LAPSE RATE WITH
NO SHARP INVERSIONS. TROPOPAUSE AT 38000 FEET. PART VIII. INTER-
CEPTION ATTEMPTED BY 2 F102'S. PILOTS ESTABLISHED RADAR CONTACT
WITH THE OBJECT ON EACH OF THREE SEPARATE PASSES. THE RADAR RETURN

WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE PILOTS TO "LOCK ON" EACH TIME. HOWEVER,
NO VISUAL CONTACT WAS MADE. THE PILOTS STATED THAT THEIR OVERTAKE
SPEED INDICATED A TARGET THAT WAS NEARLY STATIONARY. PART IV.

WEATHER BALLOONS RELEASED IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES WOULD HAVE BEEN
BORNE BY THE WINDS ALOFT TO THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. THE WIND
VELOCITY WOULD HAVE PLACED THE 00082 RELEASE FROM LORING AFB, MAINE
IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING AT APPROXIMATELY 0530Z. ALTHOUGH
PROGRAMMED TO REACH GREATER ALTITUDES, FAULTY INFLATION OR A SLIGHT
LEAK COULD RESULT IN A BALLOON LEVELING AT 47000 FEET. PART X.

THE PREPARING OFFICER IS CAPTAIN BILLY B FORSMAN, SENIOR CONTROLLER,
GOOSE NORAD SECTOR DIRECTION CENTER. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO POSITIVELY
DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF THE OBJECT. COMPARING ITS DIRECTION AND
VELOCITY WITH THE WINDS ALOFT, HOWEVER, WOULD CERTAINLY INDICATE IT
TO BE A WIND-BORNE, LIGHTER-THAN-AIR OBJECT. THE COUPLED WITH THE
TIMING LEADS ONE TO BELIEVE IT TO PROBABLY BE THE 00302 WEATHER
BALLOON RELEASED FROM LORING AFB.
