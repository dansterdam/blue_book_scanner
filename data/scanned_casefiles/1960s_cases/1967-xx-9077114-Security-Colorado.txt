MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                7 June 1967

Subj: UFO Report, 4 June 1967, Colorado

Contact was made with Goodfellow AFB, 6th Weather Group autovan 895-3451 extension 601, Col Vaughn. Major Quintanilla asked Col Vaughn if he knew of any balloons that may have been over the Colorado area on 4 June 1967. Col Vaughn did not have any balloons responsible for the sighting. He suggested that we call the Office of Naval Research in Washington regarding the Sea Space Office in California who have been launching balloons; NCAR at Palestine, 214 729-6921, Frank McCray or Jack Warren with balloons.

Contact was made with the Office of Naval Research in Washington, D.C. Mr. [redacted] and the Commander [redacted] were traveling and on leave. Commander's [redacted] secretary checked with him and he didn't feel that any of there balloons were responsible for the sighting, however, he suggested that we contact the Field Representative, Mr. Mike Evanizk, 612 373-3371 at the Univ of Minnesota, who may have additional information.

On 9 June 1967 spoke with Mr. Evanizk re balloon. They had one that went up the 1st or 2nd of June and came down in Sheridan, Wyoming. He is going to find out the date it came down and return our call. The balloon was launched from Minneapolis. When he calls back find out the programmed altitude, what type of instrumentation package it was carrying and size of the balloon. Also, do they have any plots on it.

On the afternoon of 9 June 1967 spoke with Mr Evanizk re balloon.

Their balloon came down six miles east of Sheridan, Wyoming on Sunday morning. The balloon was 100,000 cu ft, had two pkgs of 12 pounds each and was programmed for 98,000 - 100,000 ft alt.

Mr. Evanizk said the balloon was called in on Monday the 5th of June and reportedly had come down Sunday morning. However, if when he receives the packages and finds that it came down later he will let us know. He suggested that we call Linton and Winzen Research Corp.

On 12 June spoke with Holloman Balloon Control Center, Mr. Markling and received a negative reply. However, he suggested we call their Detachment in Chico, California, Capt Cunningham, area code 916 343-5011 or 343-5616 or 343-5776

On 12 June spoke with Winzen Research Corp, Mr. Williams was not in so I spoke with Mr. Nelson. They did not have any balloons. They had one launched 4 June 1967 from Palestine, Texas 2000, CDT, 3 mi cu ft balloon, however, it came down that same day within thirty miles of launch. He suggested that we call Litton Incorp as they had a balloon get away from then. Actually it was a Winzen balloon that got away but had been launched by Litton, 136 mi cu ft balloon.

On 13 June 1967 spoke with Mr. [redacted] Incorp, Minneapolis, area code 612 [redacted]. They have a derelict which was launched the 12th of May and refused to come down. It was last seen going over the Atlantic. Probably went down over the Atlantic but could come around. However, he thinks it went down because it was a 136 ft diameter balloon and had gone down to an estimated 70 ft in diameter when last seen.

Balloon carried a payload of four spheres, square about the size of two desks. Mr. [redacted] doubts that this is our balloon since it was going down in size over the Atlantic and was not built to go around the earth, though it could happen. He said if it would happen they would be rich and could sell a lot of their balloons.

On 13 June 1967 spoke with Sgt Roland Smith, Detachment #3 AFCRL, Chico, California, area code 916, 343-5011. They have not launched any balloons since early May. Also, all their balloons are accounted for.

On 13 June 1967 spoke with Clint Hankins, Palestine, Texas. All balloons have been accounted for. Have had these recent launches:

launch 0615, 4 Jun, came down 17 miles from Cisco, Texas.
launch 2000, 4 Jun, came down 22 miles NE of San Angelo.
launch 0450, 3 Jun, came down just outside of San Angelo, Texas
