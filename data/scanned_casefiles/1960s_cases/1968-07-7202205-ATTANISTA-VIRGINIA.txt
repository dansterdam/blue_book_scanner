11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer stated that "At first there was a small spot in the sky and it grew slowly in size. It held its fall size for a few seconds, before starting to slowly disappear. As it grew smaller the second one started to appear the same way." "The second one then disappeared like the first one."

COMMENTS: The local investigator felt that the observation was of the moon fading in and out of the clouds. The moon was on the horizon at an azimuth of 250 deg at the time. Dr. Hynek agreed with our evaluation of prob. moon through clouds.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
People told me about it

We were watching for them to happen where they were seen before I arrived. At first there was a small spot in the sky and in a few seconds, before I got the full size for a few seconds, before starting to appear. The object started to appear the same way.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The first occurrence side it appeared, slowly getting smaller. As it got small the second one started to appear as the first did. It seemed to be a little larger than the first one. After it became full size it held its form for a few seconds, and started to turn, into a vertical position, staying that way a few moments and turning.
