TO: TDED/UFO

From the information supplied in the message from 328 FTWG Richards Gebaur AFB, it is probable that the targets observed by the aircraft were false targets, possibly ground targets from some distance away, which can be seen on the screen because of anomalous propagation - bending or reflecting of the radar waves due to "bubbles" or abnormal variations in the atmosphere.
