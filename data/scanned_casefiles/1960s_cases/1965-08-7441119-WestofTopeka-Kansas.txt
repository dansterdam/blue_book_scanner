SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 1 Aug 65, West of Topeka, Kansas 
TO: TDDER/Mr. Bryant

Reference the attached message from 323rd STRATEGIC RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON, APO 225, which describes the observations of a bright light UFO observed by the aircrew of OSCAR PAPA 36221, apparently at the indicated location and time. This report is submitted for evaluation and further report.

TO: TDDN/UFO
From the information supplied in the message from 323rd STRATEGIC RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON, APO 225, it is possible that the targets observed by the aircraft were false targets, possibly ground targets from some distance away, which can be seen on the screen because of anomalous propagation bending or reflecting of the radar waves due to "bubbles" or abnormal variations in the atmosphere.
