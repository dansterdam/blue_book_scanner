MENTAL TELEPATHY ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL BY [blacked out]

How at school many students have seemed to feel they shall look into and yet something - 50% of up time they have seen flying saucer in "U.F.O.'s" of know they are not by in other mind, because they know other students that they see. This also has to be associated with dreams. Many time they have what a U.F.O. and see the U.F.O. They dream about a part of the U.F.O. This is not always true but has been in several instances.

One student tried to communicate with the saucer through his mind. His thought about it, copy that if it was from the planet, it shall move in this or and off for several cases this actually happened as before, was witnessed by another student. Many students have had a "[blacked out] and" in certain instances remaining the same as U.F.O. and it has now been. I would like to stress that the only happened in a minute number of cases. Can these U.F.O.'s contact us though slightly? I have it seems unbelievable, but is it not possible? All this incidents may be have some remarkable explanation.

Dear [redacted]

Further reference is made to your letter of May 9, 1964 in which you enclosed a report on Unidentified Flying Objects observed by students at the Asheville School for Boys.

Our Project Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base states that there is no data submitted which indicates that observations were anything other than stars and planets or conventional aircraft. The most significant of the planets during this period was Venus with a magnitude of 1.2.

Saturday- May 9, 1964

Dear Sirs:

Enclosed is part of a series of reports which have been given to me by several students here at school. These reports concern the sighting of various unidentified flying objects over or in the approximate area of the school grounds.

I hope that you can find some reasonable explanation for this other than the one which seems apparent, but I am inclined to think, with several other students that no other explanation can be found. I assure you that none of this has been done as a joke, because we feel that this is not a joking matter. The only incident which we have disclosed to anyone except those involved is Incident #1. The reaction to this of most of the school is to be expected. They think we have spring fever and that it is all a big joke. I can not say I blame them due to what my reactions would be if I were them.

We have talked this over among ourselves and I have been persuaded to give you the whole report, complete, as is. The reason for hesitation is due to the fact that this story might appear to be partially doctored up. I assure that this is not the case. We have not made this report except for the reason to give you a true report of the happenings here over these days. I can also assure you that the students who gave me these reports are not making them up.


- page 12 -

All these students are very honest. This was not made up for PUBLICITY because we have no intention of having this published. Before you is a true report of the happenings. If you wish I will send to you any other reports if there any more. I am inclined to think that there will be, due to these constant sightings. Many reports have been given to me in confidence and I do not wish to disclose any names unless you feel, for some reason, that it is necessary.

Please do not say anything to any of the students here at school except those involved. We feel that this would not accomplish anything but might produce unnecessary feeling among the student body and those involved. Just for the record, one master knows about it but will keep it in confidence. Please reply to me if you have some explanation or something else to offer. We will remain to keep this quiet for several obvious reasons.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
