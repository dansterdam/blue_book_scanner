But I thought I should report it because something to do with the sighting.

I saw. It was seen by about 4 people. The object I saw seemed to glow and didnot light up the area. There was no noise, no sound, and can tell the difference between such objects I know because I'm a amateur astronomer.

I do not know wether if this means any thing to do with the sighting after the sighting and I considered it for a while and the filling I was being watch. This may sound very silly sounding and I'm really scared. I was being watched. They might think I'm crazy because I saw something to do with the sighting.

Dear Sirs:

I would like to report the sighting of a U.F.O. on the morning of July 6th. It is similar to a report of about 2 years ago from Bridge City, Texas. We saw the same thing and I don't know if I should make this report. The object was strange and the same as the one I saw about 2 years ago. It was orange in color and was about 270 yards from us for about 7 minutes.

I would appreciate if you would look into this matter with such sights [sights].

Respectfully, yours

Dear Sir:

I wish to report a U.F.O. sighting on July 31, 1968 at 9:50 PM on Deweyville, Texas. Its size was similar to various stars. It gave off a whitish-blue light and was as bright as a star of the first magnitude. My father said it was moving in a north or south-south-east direction and we could not estimate its speed. We lost sight of it after a few minutes later.

Yours truly,

Text Extracted from the Document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL TO REACH THE OBJECT SIGHTED AT THE TIME. NOTE THAT THE LARGER THE OBJECT, THE CLOSER IT WOULD BE TO THE X, THE SMALLER THE OBJECT, THE FARTHER AWAY IT WOULD BE FROM THE X.
IF ANY OF ITEMS BELOW, PLACE AN X ON THE DIAGRAM TO INDICATE WHERE THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED.
IF X IS PLACED OUTSIDE THE COMPASS ROSE, INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER TO X.
