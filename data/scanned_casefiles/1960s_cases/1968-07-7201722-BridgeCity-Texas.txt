10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient Data For Evaluation
Because the observer did not seem to be interested enough in the sighting to call it to the attention of his personnel and because quickly went back to sleep while watching the object, the sighting is being evaluated as insuf data.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer stated that he sighted a self-luminous, orange object near a transformer station that is located just south of his home. After watching the object for 10 to 12 minutes the observer became tired and went back to sleep.

Here is the text from the document:

There was another sighting similiar to the object I saw. It was seen by about 4 people who did not report it.

I would also like to say that the object I saw seemed to glow and did not hardly light up the area.

After I viewed the U.F.O. for about 12 min.

I became very tried fell to sleep.
I know that it was no comet, meteor, planet, or star because I'm an amateur astronomer and can tell the differents between such thing

I do not know if this next statement has any thing to do with the sighting of the U.F.O. But after the sighting of the my letter to N.A.S.A. I had the filling that I was being watch. This may sound funny to anybody, But I really scared. I haven't told anybody this because they might think I'm crazy. But I thought I had better tell you because this might have something to do with the sighting.

SAF-OICC/Miss Turnure/6526/August 9, 1968

Your letter of July 30, 1968, to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object or UFO has been referred to this office.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached question naire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book report are inclusions.

Dear Sirs:

I would like to report the sighting of a U.F.O. on the Morning of July the 26. It is similar to a sighting made by another group of people in Orange, Texas that we know and I don't know if I should use their names in this report. The object they saw was similar to the one I saw. The object was orange and was about a transformer. The one I saw was about 250 yards from our house. I viewed it for about 12 minutes. I would be pleased if you would forward this letter to the right branch of the Air Force that deals with such sightings.

respectfully yours

Dear [redacted]

Thank you for reporting your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) to the Air Force.

Without additional information, however, we cannot offer an explanation of what you observed. But if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are inclosing.

Dear Sir:

I wish to report a U.F.O. sighted on July 31, 1968 at 9:50 PM over Deweyville, Texas. Its size was similar to Venus'. It gave off a yellowish-white light, and was as bright as a star of the -3 or -4 magnitude. My father and I saw it moving in a south or south-south-east direction. We could not estimate its speed or altitude. We lost sight of it a few minutes later.

Yours truly,
