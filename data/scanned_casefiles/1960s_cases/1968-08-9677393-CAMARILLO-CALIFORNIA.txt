PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE OF THE GROUP: 29/0703Z
2. LOCATION: CAMARILLO, CALIFORNIA
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: TEN SECONDS
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND-VISUAL
7. COURSE: TO ONE
8. PHOTOS: YES
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers sighted a bright bluish white light.

COMMENTS: The observers at one point described the light as simply a light, yet in another as a large Fireworks sparkler. No mention is made if there were any sparks or not. Also the distance of the light is given as "100 feet but it could have been miles away." Camarillo is quite close to several airfields. The sighting may have been of a plane, a meteor, a hot air balloon, a weather balloon, etc. However, since the sighting is of a light it does not really meet the definition of a UFO as given in AFR 80-17. All that can be said is that there is not enough information to determine what the light was attached to.

INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

The witnesses drove into their driveway about midnight 28 Aug 68. As they were getting out of car, the wife noticed a weird bright light hovering above the top of their house, in a shape described previously. She pointed it out to Lee, husband and they watched it move slowly across the roof (although they had stilled it could have been miles away) of it was just above the roof, then it would have appeared to be 16-20" across. It moved in a jerky motion, and then seemed to drift away very quickly, faster than a jet) and was lost sight of.

The witness appeared credible, brief not appearing in observing visual phenomena.

2. WHAT TIME DO YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?

3. WHAT TIME DO YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 2400 MINUTES □A.M. □P.M.

4. TIME ZONE □EASTERN □CENTRAL □MOUNTAIN □PACIFIC □STANDARD □OTHER

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON A ROAD MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS. IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE LOCATION AND DESCRIBE THE AREA ON NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

4. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT IS APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
