REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDBEW

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

TO: FT USAF SAF-OIPR
Wash 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter from dated 3 Nov 63,
regarding a UFO sighting. The following information is provided
to assist in a reply to Mr Sample.

2. The sighting is evaluated as a meteor. This
evaluation is based on the duration and description as well as
the direction of flight. The speed of the object as indicated
by the duration is well within the limits of meteor capability.
It should also be pointed out that the direction of flight to the
Southwest rules out possible satellite decay, also, the duration
of decay sightings are much greater. Sputnik IV decay on 5 Sep 62
lasted in excess of two minutes. The Discoverer VIII decay on
7 Mar to lasted over four minutes.

Ask a few minutes ago on manner 7:20 p.m. Local time of [illegible] time last night while other 31st my wife and was just going out of our living room into our study, noticed my telescope in fog object (not sting). I looked up quickly from my seat in the top and saw a low, one small body, by the object approaching the about the size of a tennis ball white small flying piece - broke off and then other slightly from "what" was of the last night to be in front a positively two and a move in a direction and, as might be from the [illegible] and a such let most to watch, and at gait walk. I then with the mysterious object for two practically stood watching when it gradually "got out like a plunging white static light". The object was slowly to have been a photography plane, but was not moving at just about the same speed in the sky from what I was without and then. one moving about a 10 light yes. Motion was very definite, let moving but slowed after move with a positively considerable slow of glass of wind and of my wife and I watched the one. Two point object but I wanted to anyway. I want to be as sound to be want light a what I was about 100 high but exactly [illegible] was more brief.

Dear [redacted]

This is in response to your letter of November 5, 1963, in which you reported the sighting of an unusual object on October 31st.

Your sighting has been evaluated as a meteor. This evaluation is based on the duration and description as well as the direction of flight. The speed of the object is well within the limits of meteor causality. The duration of flight rules out possible satellite decay.

Also, the duration of decay sightings in excess of two minutes and Discoverer VIII decay on March 7, 1960 lasted over four minutes.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
