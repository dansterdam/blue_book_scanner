forwarding a UFO sighting report from the following information is provided:

2. The sighting was evaluated as a meteor. This conclusion is based on the duration and description as well as the speed of the object as indicated by the observation. In addition, the diminishing of the object after the initial sighting and the reported behavior of the white-green light are indicative of the characteristics of a meteor.

a object. He saw. out. of
the and was
about 7 minutes, by in his 10 to 12
minutes.

he was a little startled when at first saw the
object, but soon settled
down and watched it closely. The object
seemed to be a very bright light, almost white in color, and was
rocking or oscillating from side to side as it moved. It was
traveling at a high rate of speed, and was estimated to be
traveling at an altitude of about 15,000 to 20,000 feet. During the
time the object was in sight, it did not change its course or speed.
After about 12 minutes, the object faded from sight, seemingly
going out of sight in the distance. There was no sound associated
with the object. The witness stated that the object was definitely
not an aircraft, and that he is familiar with all types of aircraft
in this area.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an official document from the Project Blue Book archives. 

The text in the document reads:

November 25, 1963

"This refers to your letter of November 5, 1953, in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object on September 14th.

Your sighting has been evaluated as a Hoax. The duration was much greater than is normally indicated by the duration as well as the detail in the description. As indicated by the duration it is well within the capabilities for an aircraft to be in the area southwest of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, with the reported observations.

As the sightings are so much greater than is normally received, this case is listed over 3,550 listed over 2,500 cases without discovery or solution."

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
