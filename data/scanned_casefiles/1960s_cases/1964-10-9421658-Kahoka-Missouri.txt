Kahoka, Missouri
October 10, 1964

Mr. J. Edgar Hoover
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

On the night of October 7, at 9 p.m. CST, I walked out on my porch facing the east, and happened to glance up at what I thought was the moon, which was east slightly northeast. I blinked and glanced again, then opened the screen door, looked, took off my glasses, and still the thing I saw persisted. It looked like an electric light pole I reflecting light roached from the earth to the moon. For fear I was imagining things, I ran to the neighbor, and a teen-ager came out to look, and she was just as amazed as I was. At 9:20 p.m. I went to look again, and it was gone, no moon, and the sky was black as ink.

The next day I went to our newspaper office, the Gazette-Herald, and the girl said, folks calling in had flooded the switchboard, and all of their employees had been remarking about it. One man in town said some surveyors working east of Kahoka were doing that, another said he was from a barge on the river. Now I think I did not see the moon, that it was the reflection centered up in the clouds, as I saw dear-shaped clouds floating around the centered light up there, and once the cloud looked tunnel-shaped.

It seems as though there should be some logical explanation, but it takes some brains somewhat enough to cast a beam to the clouds, could they be harmful to our eyesight? If there is no reason for such a performance, it should be stopped. I may be bothering you for nothing, but I would like an explanation. People in general are talking about it, but if anyone tries to find out about it, I am not aware of it. I hope I have not bothered you for nothing, but in these kind of times, we cannot be sure of anything of a worldly nature.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
Kahoka, Mo. # 86415

P.S. Perhaps a year or two ago I saw in the paper where a quantity of mass may guns were perfect in this country; that those things in that they could blind at quite a distance if points at anyone. I hope this will be stored and guarded like the atomic bomb, as they could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.
