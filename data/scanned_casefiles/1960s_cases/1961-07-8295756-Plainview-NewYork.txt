U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)
In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a brief description of the saucer description of the saucer observation. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. They represent the details of the observation as they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

The text handwritten in the document states:
"The first sight of this event was a brilliant light in the southern sky accompanied by a peculiar sound when 3 round or airplanei got on the air craft. I picked up communications and noncollapsable craft appeared to me. It come over town a string of lights appeared and made a turn and went south where I could no longer see by naked eye so I went upstairs and saw a formation of more than six and made another observation that will be a separate account.
This time I will on my next report express more detailed and specific information which I gather and made than I have here. The sights on this first view were extremely startling and unnatural to any conventional aircraft observation that I have ever made or heard of."

The planet Jupiter can be seen in the southeast during July and is brighter than usual for this time of year. Saturn also appears in the sky, according to the reports.

UFO APPROACHES BRAZILIAN AIRLINER

A Swissair airliner, while approaching Rio de Janeiro International Airport on 14 December 1960, was approached by an unidentified flying object. The object was observed by the pilot and co-pilot, who described it as a bright, round object with a metallic appearance, which approached the airliner from below. It maintained a constant speed and altitude relative to the airliner, remaining off to one side, until the airliner broke through the overcast.

The object was observed for approximately 8-10 minutes. During this time, it made no sudden maneuvers, but maintained a constant course, speed, and altitude in relation to the aircraft. When the airliner broke through the overcast, the object disappeared from sight. There was no evidence that the object had emitted any exhaust or caused any interference with the airliner's radio or other equipment.

The pilot and co-pilot filed reports of the incident with their company, but no further action was taken. The report was eventually forwarded to the U.S. Air Force, but no additional investigation was conducted.

Saturn Moves Slower Than Jupiter
This passage, of course, occurs with the 1962 opposition. Toward the end of the evening of July 9, Saturn will be farther from the western horizon than Jupiter. For the rest of the month, as Jupiter moves rapidly westward - setting about 4 hours after the sun - Saturn, moving more slowly, will be trailing it through the evening sky, as they are seen near.

This section provides a detailed schedule of celestial events and visibility for the month of July.

SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
THIS SPECIAL REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CAPT. GREGORY AND MAJ. QUINTANILLA, USAF (RET.), FROM THE BLUE BOOK FILES.

ON 27 JULY 1957, A CIVILIAN OBSERVATION REPORT OF A FLYING OBJECT WAS RECEIVED FROM PLAINVIEW, NEW YORK. THE OBSERVER, MS. MARY HYRE, REPORTED THAT SHE OBSERVED THE OBJECT AT 3:43 P.M. ON JULY 23, 1957. THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE.

DESCRIPTION: THE OBJECT WAS TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE, SILVER IN COLOR AND REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS. IT MADE NO SOUND AND REMAINED LEVEL WITHOUT CHANGING ALTITUDE DURING THE PERIOD OF OBSERVATION. THE OBJECT'S SPEED WAS VERY RAPID AND IT DISAPPEARED GOING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION.

CONCLUSION: A. THE OBSERVATION WAS PROBABLY OF A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE SHAPE, COLOR, SPEED AND FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS ARE TYPICAL OF A JET AIRCRAFT.

B. DETERMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT'S IDENTITY WAS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CONTACT THE OBSERVER FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS BUT SHE COULD NOT BE LOCATED.

C. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS MOST LIKELY A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

Textual output from the document:

Plainview, New York
August 29, 1961
The object in the picture appears to be a bright light over the water. It was reported to be changing size and color rapidly. The object was observed for about 15 minutes by several people. It was about the size of a basketball when first seen and changed to a smaller size. The distance to the object was estimated at about a mile. The color changed from bright white to reddish orange and then to green, then back to white. The object appeared to be hovering over the water and then suddenly disappeared.

August 2, 1961

Reference is made to your letter of August 25th. The investigation of the unidentified aerial object sighted near Plainview, New York, on July 15, 1961, has been completed. The object was observed by several persons and was described as being oval in shape, hovering at times, and occasionally changing color to a reddish hue. The investigation revealed that the object was not a conventional aircraft and did not originate from any known military or experimental source. Further investigation failed to determine the nature or origin of the object.
