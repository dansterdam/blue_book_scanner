11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Yellowish object as large as an a/c, color of star. Seen first through bedroom window and thought to be a star, however it started to move. Observed at 60 deg elevation in NE. Disappeared on same angle. Moved toward the horizon and also appeared to move in a lateral direction and slightly. (2 log) movements. Disappeared slowly by fading scallop. Will in slight after 1 hour and 15 minutes. Reported disappearance occurred during interview with the witness by the investigating official.

COMMENTS: Object observed through window, yet reported at 60 deg elevation. Likely that the elevation was somewhat lower. Arcturus was at 45 deg elevation in the East and the only major star body near the reported area. Sighting characteristics of an astro body observation. Motion attributed to illusions.

TO WHOM MR. [REDACTED] INITIALLY REPORTED HIS SIGHTING. PRIOR TO CONTACTING MR. [REDACTED] THE DUTY OFFICER ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE IF A WEATHER BALLOON HAD BEEN RELEASED, WITH AFFIRMATIVE RESULTS. DURING THE PERIOD OF CONTACT WITH MR. [REDACTED]

THE DUTY OFFICER MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE THE OBJECT, AT THE OBSERVERS REQUEST, BUT COULD NOT SIGHT IT. CONTACT WAS THEN MADE WITH NORAD SPADER, WHO ASSERTED THAT NO VISIBLE SATELLITES WERE IN THIS AREA. MR.

[REDACTED] REPORTED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT.
