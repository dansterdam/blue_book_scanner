MEMO ROUTING SLIP

TO: SMLS/Captain Flynn

REMARKS:
Reference your letter of 15 November on SAMSO Random Reentry Safety Policy. Attached are two items I thought you might be interested in concerning an "object" that dropped into a yard in Hawthorne.

The news query from the LA Herald Examiner resulted in a short story in that paper. Apparently the "thing" was part of a meteorite or something similar and not part of a space vehicle or craft entering the atmosphere.

Major Drury's section was to check the object and then forward it to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright Patterson AFB. If desired, submission of information of this type will be made in the future to SMLS.

FROM: WARD M. MILLAR, Lt. Col., USAF
Director of Information

Date: 28 Nov 67
Phone: 30030

OFFICE OF INFORMATION QUERY                                   DATE 22 September 1967
FROM Hank Allison                     AFFILIATION LA Herald Examiner       PHONE RI 81212

QUERY
What are the details and the description of the meteorol to which fell in Hawthorne today?

COORDINATION
Operations Division, 31747, Major Drury and his Sergeant

REPLY
Weighs three pounds
... the size of a doubled fist
in black with spots of white
Has the texture of a sponge, pitted and looks like lava
a dozen pieces the size of a pea were picked up with it as well.

It is being held by the Operations Division of the 652nd Support Group at Los Angeles Air Force Station to determine if the Air Force has any interest in it. If not then it will be turned over to the appropriate people for their study and analysis and use.

The object will be forwarded to the Air Force's Foreign Technology Division at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio for study and analysis.

ACKNOWLEDGED BY Capt. Dederick                               DATE 22 September 1967

Air Force
To Study
'The Thing'
A meteor-like "thing" which landed on a Hawthorne dance floor will be examined by the Air Force Monday in hopes of determining its origin.

Hawthorne Police Capt. Eugene Gores said his department received a call from a woman in the 5000 block of 125th Street Thursday night, a short time after a secret Vandenberg Air Force base missile shot in the sky.

Gores said the woman told officers she had heard a loud report as something landed on her dance floor, and later found a black "thing".

The "thing" is the size of a cantaloupe and weighs about 13 lbs. Gores said. It is now being "like Air Force or anyone," an Air Force spokesman said.

The Air Force did not believe the "thing" was in any way related to the missile shot.

Operations division of the 6592 Support Group, U.S. Air Force in El Segundo, received the "thing" and several scientists looking smaller objects found it worthy.

"They will be studying" Air Force specialists.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: FDETR (MAJ Quintanilla)

1. The enclosed objects were forwarded to this office by the Los Angeles Police Department for inspection and disposition since they were reported to have fallen from the sky. This station has no facilities to perform an analysis. Request your assistance in determining the content of objects.

2. One of the local papers gave this front page treatment and has thereby generated considerable interest. Any assistance you can render to provide a plausible explanation will be appreciated.

Maj Quintanilla:

Lt Matthews called regarding the attached. He wanted to know if this could be part of a satellite decay. I read him the paragraph I from the attached memo regarding the fact that the sample was not part of rocket body or space vehicle. I also sent him a copy of the complete file at his request.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Reference Physical Specimen   26 September 1967

7 December 1967
Captain Margenthaler called and asked to have the following questions answered.

1. Could the sample be part of a rocket body or space vehicle?
2. Is there any indication of burning or charing on the outside?
3. Could the object be a meteorite?

8 December 1967
Called Mr. Huston (Head of Materials Lab)
His response to the questions were:

1. Sample (large) was not part of rocket body or space vehicle.
   It has much too high a silicon content. The slag has a high silicon content such as found in the sample.

2. The sample had been molten at one time. This again was expected of the slag.

3. It is also unlikely that the object is a meteorite, since it does not contain enough Ni.

11 December 1967
Called Lt. Marley (Metallurgist)

1. Lt. Marley did not think it was a meteorite either because meteorites are usually high in Fe, Mn, and contain some Ni.

11 December 1967
Called Dr. Hynek (Astrophysicist)


- page 10 -

1. It is definitely not the common type of Fe-Ni meteorite.
However, he would need to look at the sample before he made a definitely
statement that it was not a meteorite.

Note: 1. Capt. Marganthelter wants the sample to be returned to
AFB.

2. Hold the specimen for Dr. Hynek to see December 18-20.

SUBJECT: Analysis of Material from Los Angeles, California

TO: TDET/UFO (Lt. Marano)

1. The sample submitted by Mrs. [redacted] of Los Angeles, California was analyzed and the data obtained was included in Evaluation Report MAY 67-7, dated 12 October 1967.

2. The 3/8" disc of metal, which appeared to have been punched from a 1/4" sheet, was analyzed spectrographically and found to be unalloyed iron. The carbon content was found to be 0.21%, thereby classifying the material as a Type 1020 steel, which is quite common.

3. Material corresponding to both samples can be found in the scrap pile of any steel mill.
