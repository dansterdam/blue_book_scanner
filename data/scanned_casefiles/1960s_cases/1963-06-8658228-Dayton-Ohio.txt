Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any education, which might be pertinent.

June, 1963, Case 11: Yes. Especially since it occurred in Dayton, a little more digging on this one would have been apropos, and relatively easy. Since time of signing was 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. if daylight saving was used, that probably corresponds to the time of launching of weather balloons.

Otherwise, in the first part of June, 1963, the committee is in remarkably good agreement. The agreement is generally too good. I wish we could have fights instead.

No meeting this week since I was in New Mexico and the father of one of the committee members died--Nancy Van Etten's father. But we will get back on the ball this week and try to finish up this year fairly soon. Then next month we should like to come visit the Great Establishment in Dayton.

Cordially,

The title at the top reads "SATELLITE 1960 DATA" and the page is divided into sections for different dates in June 1963. The columns include information such as time, longitude, latitude, and other numerical measurements. At the bottom of the page, there is a section titled "ORBITAL ELEMENTS FOR EARTH SATELLITE 1960 DATA" with some additional notes and information.

The document appears to be a log or record with repeated entries following a similar pattern. Each line contains:
- A timestamp
- Location description (either "NORTH OF CITY" or "SOUTH OF CITY")
- Degree measurement (e.g., "57 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON")
- Movement direction (usually "MOVING SE" or "MOVING NE")

The text is consistently formatted, with entries like:
"01.02.58 AM NORTH OF CITY, 57 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON MOVING SE"
"01.03.58 AM SOUTH OF CITY, 61 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON MOVING NE"

There is a handwritten note "DAYTON" and what appears to be a page number or reference code in the top right corner.

The document looks like a detailed observation log, possibly related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting, with precise time, location, and angular measurements of an object's position and movement.

18-24 Jun 63
Andes Mts, Argentina

Andes (Mendoza Area):
Between June 18 and 24, a large party of scientists, meteorologists, and Army engineers were up on the Andes studying the Zodiacal Light. On several of the nights they saw great red lights which moved up and down and to and fro on the sheer rock faces of the Cordillera, in the vicinity of the famous gigantic statue of Christ the Redeemer, and near the Santa Elena Peak. Huddled in their mountain huts, the party also heard strange "metallic noises" outside and there was much uneasy talk among the troops and flying saucers.

The whole area being uninhabited and all the climbing routes being blocked at the time by very heavy snowfalls, it was argued by all concerned that "a 'relatively' no explanation could be found". The report of this affair is also given by the CODONYC, who added that personnel of the Argentine Civilian meteorological services who have to do duty on these lonely Andean heights confirm that they have frequently seen these mysterious moving lights.

Medina, Ohio

MEDINA, OHIO.......6/23/63......3:40 AM.
A large object which seemed "as large as
an orange" was seen by Mr & Mrs Marvin Hall.
Mr Hall described the object as of a bright
white color with variations of red and
brown. It was round, with two extension
lights revolving about the central body.
"It bobbed like a buoy in the water", explained the husband. The object moved W
to NW and was last seen fading in intensity as it disappeared behind trees......
No sound, trail, exhaust, etc.

26 June 1963
Rockland, Mass.

Another June 26 sighting was made by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Tonberg of Rockland, Mass. They were sitting outside their home along with Mrs. Tonsberg's brother-in-law William Henderson. They saw a lighted object with the same exact colors and light relationship but flying much higher. They heard no sound. All three reported the object traced a zig-zag path, making a series of sharp dodgers turns without pausing in its flight. The glow the object emitted was orange and white. Mr. Henderson reported the object's flight path was sharp and irregular as in the photograph taken in Wollaston about 1:30 on the 25th or 26th. He said it appeared to be heading northwest, but repeatedly doubled back and forth over its path. "All three of us watched it for about five minutes," Henderson said, "and the main reason we did so was the late number of almost-perfect right angles taken by whatever it was." The trio first saw it when a commercial airliner bound for Logan Airport passed over their house. When the plane had passed, all three saw the orange-white light source "much higher than the airplane, tracing this zig-zag pattern."
