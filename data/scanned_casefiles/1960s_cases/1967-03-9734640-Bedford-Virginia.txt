Observed two hugh red lights appearing suddenly over the horizon. The tall and off the colors seemed to turn into a monster-like object. The lights were seen to make sudden and erratic maneuvers and at one point disappeared behind some trees. The police were alerted but no one else reportedly saw the objects on this occasion. On each occasion the police reported that they could see nothing unusual on their sight finder or search radar.
