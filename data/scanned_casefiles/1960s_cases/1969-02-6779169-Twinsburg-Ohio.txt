February 19, 1969

Dear Sirs:

On Monday, February 17, 1969, at about 6:40 pm, there was a report called into the Twinsburg Police Station, and policemen were dispatched to the area of Drive, and Drive, which is the exact area where I live. A person from the area had reported a large white object, with red lights surrounding it, following their family car, and more than 20 persons had also reported it. There were three Policemen dispatched in two cruisers. Sgt. Donald V. France, Patrolman Walter Orcutt, and Patrolman Herbert Nunn, were the officers.

We had noticed the disturbance on our Television set, as the color contrast went completely out, and the sets recovery unit, tried to retrieve the signal, but for over an hour, the set was out. During this time, my mother had come out, and had seen the object in question. She was afraid to report it, because of an incident that had happened to us while traveling home from California in 1966. I had sent a picture and a description, and time and place to Wright Patterson, and had never heard from them until I had asked for information while doing a science report in my senior high year, (1968), and then they even denied receiving my letter, but they did send me some very valuable information, and my report was a Science Fair Success.

I was wondering if there is an organization where a person can get involved in interviewing other persons who have seen, or think have seen U.F.O.'s. If there is such an organization, please write me, and inform me of it. I am 19 yrs. old. This subject has interested me for many years. Please return a letter either

way. I would appreciate an answer on the U.F.O. reporting in
our area, and if there was a radar contact, what if any identi-
fication was made.

About the group, I would be willing to correspond, and answer
all letters pertaining to the subject.

I had thought of writing the Air Force Base, and asking if
I could form an organization of young people who are interested
in the subject, as to if we could start a club to investigate
sightings without being outside our legal rights, or being cast
off as nosy teens.

Thank you in advance, and I hope to hear from you in the
near future. I will greatly appreciate your time.

Thank You
