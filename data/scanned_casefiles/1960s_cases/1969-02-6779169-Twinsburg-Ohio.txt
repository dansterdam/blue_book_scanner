Dear Sir:

On Monday, February 17, 1969, at about 6:40 p.m., the report called into the Twinsburg Police Station, and reported seeing a strange object, which is the exact area where I live. A person does had reported a large white object, with red lights, floating above the trees and road more than a half mile from where I live. Also reported it. There were three policemen dispatched to investigate. Sgt. Donald V. Prange, Patrolman Walter Grozinski, and Patrolman Herbert Hunn, were the officers.

We had contacted the television station on our television, but the color contrast went completely out, and the sets would not, tried to control the signal, but for over an hour, we could hear the sound, but the object in question. She was afraid to report it, because she assistant that had happened to us while traveling home on Interstate 271 on 1965. I had never a picture and a distant time and place to Wright Patterson, and had never heard until I had asked for information while doing a science my paper intake 1969, as just after, about 7:00 p.m. They told me they could and my report was a science fair success.

I was wondering if there is an organization where can get involved in interviewing other persons who have had UFO encounters. If there is such an organization, I would be glad. This has interested me for many years. Please return a letter.

Here is the transcribed text from the document:

"Way- I would appreciate an answer on the U.F.O. reporting our case and a radar contact, since if any fiction was made. 

About the group, I would be willing to correspond, and all letters pertaining to the subject. 

I was thought of writing the Air Force Base, and asking form an organization of young people who are interested in this field, as to if we could start a club to investigate sightings without being outside our legal rights, or being off as assy teens.

Thank you in advance, and I hope to hear from you in near future. I will greatly appreciate your time.

Thank you"
