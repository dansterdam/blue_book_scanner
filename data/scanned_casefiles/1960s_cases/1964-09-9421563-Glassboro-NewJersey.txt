FACTS ON THE GLASSBORO LANDING: The alleged saucer landing at Glassboro, New Jersey on September 18, 1964 has received considerable publicity in the press and has led to a number of official enquiries. While some information has already been published, it seems desirable to present the facts as known at this time.

1. On the evening of September 18, 1964 Mrs. Jessie Roestenburg and her two friends, Mrs. Mildred Landis and Mrs. Katharine Nulton, while returning home, allegedly observed a large lighted object descend to the ground in a meadow near Glassboro, New Jersey. Mrs. Roestenburg stated that the object, which was about 40 feet in diameter, hovered over the meadow about 5 to 10 minutes and then took off at a high rate of speed. 

2. The Glassboro Police Department was notified by a resident of the area and the police went to the scene. They did not observe any object in the air or on the ground. Mrs. Roestenburg then led the police to the spot where she claimed the object had landed. The police found no physical evidence to substantiate her story.

3. An Air Force investigator from McGuire AFB, Captain William B. Neff, interviewed Mrs. Roestenburg on the following day. She repeated the details of her story, but was unable to provide any physical evidence to support it. The Air Force investigator could find no evidence to corroborate the alleged landing.

4. On January 9, 1965 Dr. J. Allen Hynek of the Air Force scientific advisory group, visited the site of the alleged landing. After a thorough ground search, he could find no physical evidence to indicate that a landing had taken place.

About 10 days after the alleged sighting, an article appeared in a local newspaper stating that the two young girls who were with Mrs. Roestenburg denied seeing anything unusual. They stated that Mrs. Roestenburg was mistaken and that they had not seen a landed object. This contradicts Mrs. Roestenburg's version of the incident.

It is the opinion of the Air Force that the evidence does not support the contention that a landed UFO was present at the site near Glassboro, New Jersey on September 18, 1964. We will continue to report further information as we receive it.

RECENT NEWS

THE SIGHTING OF SEPTEMBER 4th, is glowing object in the sky was seen over Glassboro, N.J., on September 4, 1964, according to a report received by the information office, United States Air Force, Westover Air Force Base, Mass.

According to the report, the object was first sighted about 9:50 p.m. in the general direction of Glassboro, N.J., and was observed for approximately five minutes. The object was described as a glowing object, larger than a star, and moving in a northeasterly direction.

The report was called in to the local police, who in turn notified the military authorities. Major Ward Campbell, Jr. contacted the local police, who in turn were told that the object had apparently disappeared from view at about 10:00 p.m. No other details were given in the report.

The site was visited by an Air Force officer the next day who interviewed the witnesses. His findings follow:

The most accurate description of the landing spot was supplied exclusively to the undersigned officer. The landing spot was claimed to have been positively identified from the natural foliage markings left on the ground. The indentation left on the ground measured aproximately ten feet in diameter and it was apparent on grass 20 feet from the spot. The grass in the center of the indentation was broken down, and dirt beneath the surface was somewhat disturbed.

On the sides of the indentation, a straw-like weed was noticeable broken and appeared to have been pushed down, not pulled up. Within a diameter of 25 feet from the center of the indentation, there were a number of markings or impressions that were clearly visible on the ground.

These markings or impressions consisted of four flat impressions, roughly triangular in shape, and from 18-24 inches in width. The impressions were spaced approximately 6 to 8 feet apart, symmetrically arranged around the center. Each of these impressions showed signs of the same type of vegetation disturbance as was found in the center indentation.

In addition, there were a number of smaller, circular impressions, from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, located between the larger triangular impressions, and interspersed radially around the center.

There was no evidence of scorching or burning of the vegetation, and the disturbed areas showed no signs of heat or fire. The soil beneath the topsoil was not disturbed below a depth of approximately 1 to 2 inches.

The report also states that the military authorities had no other information on this matter.

Adjuste to the vehicle as thw camo. They succeeded in identifying the matter aa a weather balloon, evidenced by the shape, color, and flight pattern. However, the report indicates that one or more witnesses felt this identification was incorrect, and viewed the object as something else. Obviously those were the two sons of Ward Campbell. One son apparently had a fairly detailed explanation to offer in support of his contention that the object was not a weather balloon, but rather some other type of aerial object. The report notes that the witness "does not believe the incident was a hoax". It provides that just as the witness was about to reveal what he felt the object was, a sudden noise caused him to step away from the phone and that he was unable to give any further information. The report concludes by stating that the air force was "unable to ascertain the true identity of the object".

"Charges Earth - Charged Particles at Glassboro" 
By Frank Toughill - in the Glassboro Staff
Glassboro, N.J., Sept. 7 - The mystery on my hands.

The mystery centers around some weird marks which were discovered in an oat field near this campus of Glassboro State College. The marks, about four in number, were circular and stretched out in a line about 20 feet long.

The marks measured about two feet in diameter and were depressed into the ground about two inches on each side and two inches deep. The marks glow dimly a greenish-white phosphorescent light.

The three marks were the indices in diameter and six inches deep. They were discovered by a boy named Campbell, 12, or 13 years old, who had been checking on the family cow and calf in the field.

Campbell said the field had been thoroughly checked on Labor Day, and the marks were not there then. He said the family dog, which had been accompanying him, became uneasy and refused to go near the marks.

Hundreds of persons want to see the "mystery" hole. Authorities M.J., Sept. 8 -
Hundreds of persons want to visit the oat field near here yesterday, where strange marks were discovered on Labor Day.

In the center of a 20-inch diameter hole was a 30-inch diameter depression about 4 inches deep.

Roy Campbell, 14, said the hole was discovered by his two sons, who were getting the family cow and calf.

Campbell said the boys reported the hole about 8 o'clock on Labor Day evening. A few minutes later, Campbell said, the hole appeared to give off a reddish glow, and the boys said a red glow appeared about a half inch above the hole.

The boys investigated the story and found the charred area about 1 1/2 yards in diameter around the hole. Hundreds of persons went to see the "mystery" hole."

Police, USAF Officials 'Mystified' Here:
Glassboro Scientists Experimenting With Authorities
At Glassboro last night, Sergeant Robert D'Onofrio and representatives of the Gloucester County Sheriff's Office said they were still conducting an investigation of a report like the mysterious holes found in the woods off Delsea Drive near Malaga, which occurred last Saturday.

1. Our investigation showed these holes were actually an average of 3.5 inches in diameter, and 9 to 11 inches deep. (For actual dimensions see Page 2)

2. According to our investigation, figures called "strange visitors" appeared. The holes were not exactly 27 feet apart. (For actual distances see Page 2)

3. Incident-September 1st.

4. Saturday, September 5, 1964.

According to local officials, discovery of the circles or charred areas of corn in the woods at Ward's Lake was reported by Ward Cosbill, Sr., on 30 August 1964. Glassboro Police and the N.J. State Police investigated and found charred circles approximately 27 feet in diameter, in an area adjacent to Ward's Lake. The area affected was apparently an acreage of 2 to 3 acres on Saturday, September 5, 1964. A random 20-year-old youth, questioned at the scene, could give no explanation for the unusual phenomena, other than that he had seen a red flash in the sky just prior to finding the charred areas in the woods. The authorities investigated the warden's report, leading to notification of Glassboro officials that an investigation was being conducted there.

The text in the image is as follows:

"Glassboro, - The Air Force investigators were, they took back to Headquarters Monday, September 7, 1964, information concerning a sighting of an unidentified flying object they were advised last Saturday in an Air Force alert. Full details were not released.

The Air Force Scientific consultants. The investigators concluded that there were the marks that were observed, and said she saw a "red glow" in the sky and a stationary light some distance of this starlike object. 

The investigation was handled by Air Force Major Underwood of Philaelphia and Capt. L. Rosell of the local Pesfield. 

Police officials say a triangular arrangement of 4 lights with a larger star-like center all of which remained stationary for several hours was observed last Saturday by two young brothers. They had previously observed the object on Friday evening about which a red glowing object landed.

Our interest in the Glassboro case started on Monday, September 7, 1964. In the eleventh message, an announcement was made that these had been a UFO sighting. - a crater having started about 30 feet-across, was present and serious tripod marks were discovered at Glassboro, New Jersey. This was the first information given subject matter of this report by a Philadelphia TV Station.

We did not make our initial trip to Glassboro until the following Saturday, September 12. Part of the reason for this was that we feel that this was a mistake, for in delaying our investigation we may have eliminated chances for collected more concrete and clear evidence which is so important in all UFO cases. During the week, the area had been plowed under by curiosity seekers, Glassboro police, and the Air Force. It has also rained before and on the Saturday-we got there. This may distort slightly the validity of some evidence presented later in our report. This, however, has all been taken into consideration, and has been given much thought. We have come to the conclusion that none of our evidence is so doubtful as to warrant its being dismissed as unreliable, nor is it meant to be."

Joy
For Space Landing Hoax
The bizzard starting, accompanied by strange sounds, and floodlights for a short time Monday night, apparently was a hoax set up to attract attention. About a dozen cars were parked in the area. Several persons claimed to have seen a "flying saucer" landing, but police found no trace of this, Although the lights and sounds did occur, the explanation appears to be some kind of a prank or hoax.

LURED THOUSANDS
As a result of news stories and reports, hundreds - perhaps even thousands - of local residents flocked to the area in hopes of seeing the "flying saucer."

The boys, with their prank, probably caused an undue amount of excitement and even some fear, as some persons said they "knew it was real." However, the police found no evidence of a landing or of any unusual activity other than the lights and sounds reported.

STRANGE THINGS
Local authorities found some rather strange things. However, they indicated this apparent hoax may have been the work of mischievous youths out for a prank. "They probably did it to see how many people they could bring to the area," he said.

Justice Lawrence Myers then said Coppolino if he had any information regarding the details of the "flying saucer" landing, but Coppolino said he had none since he did not see it.
The Judge then sentenced Coppolino, with the warning that if anything like this happens again, he will be severely dealt with.

The Spaceship
Tuesday, January 19, 1964.

SPACE SHIP LANDS NEAR GLASSBORO
GLASSBORO, N.J., Jan. 19 - A strange space craft landed in a wooded area near here last Friday night, according to several residents who reported seeing the object.

Michael Rasmowitz, 13 (eight), accompanied by Capt. Philip J. Cardavelle, of Glassboro police, visited the scene and here is their report:

GUY PAYS $10 COURT COSTS FOR 
SPACE LANDING HOAX

The 13-year-old perpetrator of the Glassboro, N.J., 'space landing' hoax was charged in juvenile court and paid a $10 court costs for his prank at the time, police said.

Capt. Cardavelle said that the boy had rigged up a light and sound effects to simulate a space landing, attracting a large number of curious spectators. The boy later admitted the hoax when confronted by police.

Capt. Cardavelle told how Rasmowitz had led him and others to the scene, which was in a wooded area, where the boy claimed a 'spaceship' had landed. However, the captain said, a close inspection revealed only a light and sound device.

Cardavelle said the boy's 'spaceship' apparently consisted of a battery-operated lamp and a hand-cranked sound effects device. The captain said the boy had become something of a local celebrity as a result of the hoax.

Text transcription:

It was about 3:15 PM, Saturday afternoon, when these Renderskit and J. Walt Klinglng arrived at the scene. Here the clearing was first found.

The clearing was located in a wooded area containing mainly traces of oak, hickory, sassafras, and a few pines. These trees are all common to southern New Jersey forests. Other similar landmarks are near all common plants, shrubs, and mosses which are found throughout the southern New Jersey area.

The clearing in which the markings were found is located about 100 yards from the dirt road leading from Pitman to Glassboro. A house located about 600 yards from the scene at 600 yards is within hearing distance of the crater. Any explosion or the size needed to create a crater or comparable measurements would be audible to the occupants of the house. There is no main highway and is presently not well travelled at night. This all adds to the probability of any loud noises, and especially an explosion, would have been reported to the police or anyone else by the occupants of this house.

The possibility remains, however, that the occupants were responsible for the whole thing. This is doubtful since those who discovered the crater would have probably recognized their neighbors.

The owners of the property where the crater was found were generally more concerned with property damage by possible trespassers over the place than with making any sort of a profit or gaining fame by the report of the crater. This is usually not the case in a hoax.

The clearing itself was just a small opening between the trees, approximately 25 feet across. No trees lines, with the exception of the broken trees, protruded from above into the clearing, but rather extended just to its edge.

- page 15 -

This page of the document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a detailed description of some observations, measurements, and other details related to a particular UFO sighting or report.

In the center of the image, there is a large block of text describing various physical characteristics of the observed object, such as its size, shape, color, and other details. The text also mentions measurements and distances related to the object and its surroundings.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

In the center of the clearing there was a hole, 7 ft. 40 inches in length and 5 ft. 13 in. in width. Around the perimeter of the hole, sand was mounded, four inches in on all sides and one inch above ground level. The color of the sand was more yellow. Nineteen inches centered with in the perimeter of the hole there was a white circle.

Approaching the center of the crater, there is a drop of five inches (actually four inches below ground level). This drop extends in toward the center of the hole. The color of this and was more yellow and typical of this type of sand, known as "cascade sandy sand". Note, again the sand here was covered in places with an extremely thin layer of very white sand.

The central and deepest portion of the hole is twenty inches below the ground level and twenty-seven inches in diameter. The sand in this region of the hole was colored a yellow-orange, indicating that this sand was a much softer or finer textured as compared with the section of the hole. There were definite signs of the hole's creation. There were some faint prints around the hole. However, no small foot impressions are discernible. In any event, we cannot locate them.

The three "tripped holes" in question are located at the edge of the clearing. They are not evenly spaced or centered, nor are they symmetrical. Their dimensions are as follows: A to B, 26 ft.; from B to C, 27 ft.; from C to A, 23 ft. 4 in.; the dimensions of A were 17 in. by 17 in. by 9 in. in depth; the dimensions of B were 16 in. by 13 in. by 11 in. in depth; the dimensions of C were 13 in. by 12 in. by 10 in. in depth; the distance from A to the center hole was 13 ft. 6 in.; the distance from B to the center hole was 15 ft. 9 in.; and the distance from C to the center hole was 13 ft.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from an old project blue book document.

Text extracted from the document:

These "imprded" impressions appear to have been pressed rather than dug. Roots in the a.d. extending into these holes we - not shared off, but were pressed heavily into the sides and bottom of those holes. Anyone digging these would have had to use considerable force to achieve this as impressions showed.

A young sassafras tree was broken in half six feet above the ground. The break was about 7 ft. 6 in. from the center of G. The tree was partially uprooted, probably due to the numerous visitors. The top of the tree was grasped and had some bark removed. This would seem to indicate that something had to crawl up on or down this tree. The bark itself was not greatly splintered. Sassafras is a soft wood and splinters greatly when broken, unless it is broken violently and with great force.

The limited data we have on the species indicates that in the area conditions as to soil depth, amount of humus, etc. a sassafras tree of 6-8 inch diameter would require 20-25 years to develop. If we use this type strength data and allow a spread concentration as appropriate piece strength, it might mean that a weight in excess of 1500 pounds to break the specimen. This indicates a sizable creature walked through or on (by?) this area.

There was a patch of moss about a foot from the center hole. These mosses were not in any way damaged, either by heat or by particles thrown from the hole. This is very important. This shows that the hole that fixed the sand in the 8. Although the central hole is 27 in. in diameter, it is not perfectly symmetrical.

- page 17 -

There is no photograph present in this document. However, the text of the document has been provided, and I will output it as follows:

Center hole was very controlled and was confined to the hole. If an explosive was used to make the hole, it was highly directional blast. There were no burn marks anywhere in the area from the blast. The laboratory results indicate that no chemicals used in making a direction. Careful analysis of the type needed to produce the blast and disturbance of the soil indicate that the soil around the hole contains chemicals and explosives were not used. We did not, however, get positive and definitive proof of an explosion. We can deduce tests on soil samples that the area was saturated with inorganic material. A concentration of nitrates in the soil would indicate the use of chemical explosives.

Five soil samples were taken at the site of the UFO landing in Glassboro, New Jersey. The soil is typical of sand. Tests with addition of some material indicating a magnetic anomaly. The soil is in three layers; the first and uppermost is black with a great deal of organic material in it and is approximately 1.5 inches in depth, the second is gray with some carbon material and appears to be approximately 1.5 inches in depth; the third layer is brown/orange in color and its depth was not determined, but was at least 20 inches. All soil is silty and (parts) with plain "dirt".

The original soil samples obtained from the Central hole (main hole) from Fig. 1, as in the other test holes, a test was performed on this sample, as well as to determine the presence of nitrates, if any, the "known ring" test was conducted. This test showed only a slight reaction, indicative, but not conclusive, of the presence of nitrates. Additional tests also showed slight traces of nitrates and another sample was taken. This same sample showed only a faint trace of nitrates and the reported landing was not considered significant. It is felt that these tests are accurate.

- page 18 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

This call appeared to be rather routine on its face. The test proved negative on this sample. 

Soil sample #3 was obtained at 4 feet from the center of the area. The nitrate test on this sample was also found to be negative; however, coloring in the test kit possibly indicated a very faint trace of nitrates.

The soil sample #4 was obtained at the same location as #3 but was taken 18 inches below the surface, in the brown/orange layer. The nitrate test proved to be positive, showing the presence of nitrates.

All tests and attempts to obtain evidence of the hole or impression in the right side of the broken tree were unsuccessful. It was decided that no test would be necessary on this sample.

All tests performed indicated were performed to determine if any unconventional explosives were used. Our conclusion is that the central hole was not the result of an explosion of conventional chemical explosives. Chemical explosives usually leave nitrates at explosion sites.

Report on soil gases from Battelle-7:

Gasseous matter is found to consist of a grayish-brown surface layer over a region or disturbance which may indicate the site of Glassboro sighting. The soil gas sample taken from this layer appears to contain an excess water content, probably from vaporization of water due to heat emission from the ground. These well-delineated soil gas accumulations indicate they occur primarily along existing faults or fractured bedrock within the area. The steep edges of the accumulation indicate a source that is escaping gas to the surface.

Extracted text from the document:

"Excavated trench have microscopic panicles up to 3 inches in diameter. The particles are in the shape of spheres or irregular spherical segments. The report further states that the particles range in size from 1/16 inches to 3 inches in diameter. They are scattered over the area and in some places are concentrated up to 14 inches deep. These particles seem to have a glassy lustrous appearance. They are brittle and tend to crumble when handled.

The analysis by the Laboratory show these particles to be normal soil particles and there is nothing unusual about them. The particles size and frequency is what one would expect to find in cultivated fields generally.

The thickness of the soil layer disturbed by the landing gear of the craft was about 18 inches. This was determined by observing the soil profile when the pit was dug.

Relative to the work done by Dr. Brown at Southern Connecticut State University. He stated that there was no evidence that sophisticated explosives were used, and furthermore, it was the work of some amateur chemist.

Dr. Brown made no explanation of the three "tripod holes" or of the broken trench.

In a phone conversation with Colonel Bouchard, the Investigations officer at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, I learned the Air Force had "made available" certain information.

Text from the document:

This samples any pictures from the area to Dr. Brown. It is Colonel Bouchard's understanding, "as far as I know", Dr. Brown did not visit the actual site, some 30 miles southwest of Maguire. I can make available to try knowledge, did not include a chemical analysis to determine nitrate content or anything else by Dr. Brown or by anyone at Maguire.

Colonel Bouchard said the samples would be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for complete examination by Air Force experts. Said Colonel Bouchard, "He only conducted the initial investigation." We are sending the samples to Wright-Patterson where he will be kept.

Since Dr. Brown did not take any samples of his own for examination, and since he left his statement with the Air Force at Maguire at the time of his visit, it would like to know how Dr. Brown determined the presence of potassium nitrate and what his views are concerning the "bruised marks" on broken trees. A copy of this report will be sent to Dr. Brown.

In drawing Figure 1, it was noted that triad holes A and B are almost the same distance from the center of the crater and are almost centered on the crater. However, the third hole C is not concentric.

Assuming the position of hole C could be changed to form a more concentric triangle, C would have to lie on a declining axis with a diminished distance from the center. This would satisfy the triangle indicated between the three holes would fall across the broken branch, and come very close to showing the point of the break. This leaves, possible to a very definitive conclusion.

Before going further, I would like to present parts of an article written by Carol Lorenzen which appeared in FATE Magazine, August 1964, pp 27-30. (For those who are unfamiliar with FATE, it is a monthly magazine which prints "news stories of the strange and the unknown". It considers a wide range of information on UFO sightings.)

These are parts of the late account of the UFO landing in Socorro, New Mexico on April 24, 1964. 

It is a dry, rocky draw within the city limits, but isolated from the town proper. Only the tracks of two cars are visible on the spot. The highway, less than half a mile away, is hidden.

9. Air Force Headquarters for UFO investigation.

Although there are basic ground differences, the New Jersey site resembles that of Socorro in that the highway in both cases was hidden. As New Jersey by the woods. No houses are visible from the New Jersey site, they too are hidden.

The marks left by the machine are not entirely unfamiliar to experienced NICAP investigators, but they are still a puzzle. As another point of similarity, ground depressions found at both sites approximate impressions a little less. Almost in the middle of the area there-disturbance. The terrain, like at Socorro, is rocky and wooded. The area at the New Jersey site was circled and marked, and something from the scene was removed, as was done in the Socorro incident.

As in the Socorro incident there were no tracks. The soil in New Jersey was soft and would show something of the same weight as the Socorro craft, but make holes over twice as deep to make holes over twice as deep to make the surrounding area at all.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book regarding a UFO incident in Glassboro, New Jersey in 1964.

Text extracted from the document:

A very important point relating to the markings at the site of the landing was the indications found here of the triad system which was apparently used. The radiation effect showed this markings and settled to earth in such a way that they would indicate a weighted down or heavy indentation. No chemical residue of any kind was left behind and the markings were burned only toward the apparent center or hole.

Here a difference is found. In the Glassboro case the indentations were not wedge shaped, but they appeared to be spirally shaped at the bottom. This seems to show something blunted or round at the end made the hole. Again only the center hole was affected by the heat. The markings from the vehicle on the surface were apparently quite slight. The pressure of the vehicle from Kuka was found to have caused three tripod holes about this pressure on the surface. The indications can be found to prove the incident is a hoax.

We feel reasonably sure the sightings were the result of some unknown type of vehicle, possibly interplanetary, landing in the clearing. 
In closing, we invite any persons having additional information on the Glassboro sighting to make their information available to us.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Investigator: Sgt. S. Curtis Claver, 8920 51st Ave., Elmhurst, N.Y.
Date: 14 Sept. 1964
Witness: Arnold B. Campton, Deerfield, 22 July 1964

This report has been prepared from information provided by the witness at the time he reported the incident. The witness is considered a reliable and credible source.

The incident occurred on 22 July 1964 at approximately 2330 hours. The witness, Arnold B. Campton, was driving his automobile northbound on Route 47 near Glassboro, New Jersey. As he approached an intersection, he observed a large lighted object hovering over the roadway, approximately 300 feet ahead of him.

The object was described as being about 100 feet in diameter, silhouetted against the night sky. It appeared to be chrome in color and was illuminated from within, emitting a bright white light. The object was observed to hover motionlessly for a period of about one minute before it suddenly accelerated in a vertical direction, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.

The witness stated that the object was completely silent and that there was no evidence of any exhaust or propulsion system. He further reported that the illumination from the object was so intense that it completely illuminated the surrounding area, enabling him to clearly see the road and countryside. He stated that he experienced no physical effects as a result of the encounter and that his automobile operated normally throughout the incident.

The witness is considered a reliable and credible individual. His report appears to be a straightforward and honest account of what he observed. No other witnesses have been identified at this time, and there is no physical evidence available for examination. The case is presently classified as "unidentified".

LOCATION: Glassboro, New Jersey, United States

DATE: September 9, 1964

INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:
On September 9, 1964, at approximately 11:00 PM, a local resident reported observing a bright, unidentified aerial object hovering over the town of Glassboro, New Jersey. The object was described as being approximately 40 feet in diameter, glowing with a reddish-orange hue, and emitting a humming sound. 

Several other witnesses in the area also reported seeing the object. One witness, a local police officer, was able to take a series of photographs of the object before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The photographs were subsequently analyzed by Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects. The analysis concluded that the photographs did not provide conclusive evidence of an extraterrestrial aircraft, but the origin and nature of the object remained unexplained.

The case was classified as "unresolved" and added to the growing archive of unidentified aerial phenomena documented by Project Blue Book over the years.

Location: Glassboro, New Jersey 
Date: September 9, 1964 

On September 9, 1964, at approximately 2235 hours, the report writes that several persons in Glassboro, New Jersey reported seeing a bright, multi-colored light in the sky. The light was described as rapidly changing colors from red to white to green. Some witnesses said the light seemed to hover in the sky for several minutes before suddenly shooting off at a high rate of speed.

Local police were notified and investigated the incident. They were unable to identify the source of the light. The report states that no aircraft were in the area at the time and no meteorological phenomena could account for the sighting.

Investigators from Project Blue Book were dispatched to interview witnesses and examine the area. The report concludes that the incident remains unexplained and is classified as a "Unidentified" under Project Blue Book standards.

Boy Fined '$50 In Spaceship Hoax in N.J.

By The Associated Press
GLASSBORO, N.J. - A 16-year-old youth was fined $50 Thursday for perpetrating a hoax last weekend in which he claimed a spaceship had landed in a field.
The youth, whose name was withheld, pleaded guilty to making false reports of an emergency. He was fined in Glassboro Municipal Court.
The boy told authorities that at 1:30 a.m. last Saturday he had seen a spaceship land in a field near the Rowan School of Technology here. He said the craft was about 40 feet in diameter and had green, yellow and red lights.
After an intensive search, police determined the report was a hoax. The youth later admitted he had made up the story.
Working as a delivery boy for a newspaper, the youth saw the lights of a truck being loaded and mistook them for a spaceship, authorities said.
The police chief said the youth's stunt caused "quite a disturbance" and that he had to call in extra patrolmen to handle the situation.

THE "CASE" IN NEW JERSEY
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR JAMES G. AYDELOTTE, a resident of Glassboro, New Jersey, a town of 10,000, has in a research project covering the activities of UFOs, made a study of one case which occurred in his area on September 9, 1964 and which, because of its significance, is being reported herein.
The above is an abstractFROM AP UFO HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. to the Commanding General, USAF, Washington, D.C. pertaining to the case.
Glassboro, New Jersey, a town of 10,000, lies in a rural area, approximately 20 miles southeast of Philadelphia. On September 9, 1964, at about 10:15 pm, two young boys, aged 12 and 13, were in the backyard of their home, when they observed a strange light in the sky. This light, which was white and dome-shaped, was located approximately 100-150 feet above the trees and some 1,000 feet distant from their position. The object was hovering, and after observing it for some time, the two boys called their parents to observe the object also. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yoeli, came out and also watched the object for some time.
Mr. Yoeli reported that the object had a dome-shaped top and a metallic underside, and appeared to be luminous. It hovered for some time, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed, going straight up and out of sight. 
Investigators from the New Jersey State Police were dispatched to the scene, but were unable to locate the object or obtain any further evidence. The local newspapers at the time carried stories of the sighting, but no photographs were obtained.
At the request of the Air Force, a detailed report of the incident was prepared by the private investigator, James G. Aydelotte, and forwarded to Air Force Headquarters. The Air Force has officially classified the case as "Unidentified."

UFO INVESTIGATOR

EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS HOAX CLAIM

An investigation has been made of a UFO report originating at Glassboro, N.J., in September 1964. A trained Air Force officer, who was with the Strategic Air Command, reported seeing a strange object in the sky over Glassboro. The Air Force report indicates that the witness, who was considered a reliable observer, described the object as circular in shape, larger than a car, and hovering about 300 feet above the ground. The object then accelerated and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. This case is being investigated further, and any new developments will be reported in a later issue.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

TO: Commander, Aeronautical Systems Division (AMAD) ATTN: ASRMF-19
Patterson AFB, OHIO

1. An investigation was conducted by this Wing with the cooperation of the Glassboro Police Department regarding an incident which occurred on 4 Sep 64. A local teenage boy launched a homemade rocket which appeared in a Philadelphia newspaper. (see attachments) and various information was gathered by this Wing and the Glassboro Police department.

2. Our investigation team was unsuccessful in locating the individual who launched the rocket vehicle on this date. Interviews with the Glassboro Police and with the local populace revealed that the rocket vehicle was homemade and appeared to have been launched from a local area junk yard. No pieces of the rocket vehicle were recovered or examined by a forensic analyst for any residue that might indicate the type or character of the propulsion material used. The police claimed to have gathered the expended material and disposed of it. This was an unfortunate situation as we were unable to conduct any meaningful analysis of the incident.

3. A discrepancy in this nature does not contain enough of a conclusive nature to warrant further intensive investigation.
