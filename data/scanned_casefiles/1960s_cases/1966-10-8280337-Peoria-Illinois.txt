35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I feel positive about seeing some form of UFO. After walking into my house and depositing packages I was carrying I hurried back outside to see if there might be some kind of high-tension wire over the area in back of my house (knowing well there was no such wire). I just was so awed I had to take another look to prove to myself that I actually had seen something in the night sky.

Gentlemen:

Two weeks ago on October 11 between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m. I saw a moving light (at what seemed to be a height just above the tree tops) pass over my house. The light was elongated (perhaps three feet in length and a few inches thick -- from my position on the ground), brilliant yellow in color, and moved very fast. There was no noise. I am sure I saw something of this description. Even though I live on a well lit street corner, I was startled when I looked up into the dark sky and saw the "thing" moving so swiftly.

I am writing to you because I just read an article entitled, "UFO's To Be Probed" in the October 22, 1966, edition of Science News. You asked in this article that such events be reported.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
