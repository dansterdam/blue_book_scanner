AIRBORNE OFFICERS STATEMENT CONCERNING AIRCRAFT IN AREA AT
TIME OF SIGHTING: HIGH ALTITUDE JET AND CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS
OVER DENVER; ONE C-47 AND ON T-33 FLYING LOCAL FROM LOWRY AFB.
T-33 LANDED TO THE WEST AT LOWRY AT 24.52. HIS TRAFFIC
PATTERN WOULD PUT HIM IN VIEW OF THE OBSERVER AS STATED AND
AS HE TURNED ONTO THE 45 DEGREE APPROACH TO THE INITIAL, THE
LIGHT WOULD APPEAR TO STOP AND MOVE ERRATICALLY. IN MY
ESTIMATION, MR. [REDACTED] SIGHTED THIS T-33 ON 2 SEP 60 AND OTHER
AIRCRAFT LANDING LIGHTS ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS.
