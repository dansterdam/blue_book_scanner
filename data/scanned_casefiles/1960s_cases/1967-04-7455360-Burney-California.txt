Probable (AIRCRAFT)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported a glowing white object traveling toward the northern horizon. The object was visible for approximately 10 minutes before only disappeared in the north. The FAA requested a radar fix to be made. This was accomplished with range and height finder radars. The radar then reverted back to SAC operation and did not track the object.

COMMENTS: There seems to be no reason why the observation could not have been on a small aircraft with landing lights on. A small plane on VFR would not have had to file flight plans with the FAA and would explain why the FAA had no record of it. Under normal operations, SAC did not track objects going slower than 180 knots and was not interested in tracking.


- page 1 -

Observations: The object was seen moving Northerly at an altitude of roughly 8000 feet, near Lassen peak. Close examination of a navigational map of the area revealed that the radar ray does come close to several points on the terrain, but the Moving-Target-Indicator operates to remove all nonmoving objects and should have had no difficulty in discerning the moving object. If it remained at an altitude of 8000 feet, the observer would have seen it 'rise' above the hills to the south, near Lake Almanor.

The hills there have an altitude of 6000-7000 feet. On a straight northerly course, the object would have been visible under ideal conditions until it passed over the hills just south of Klamath Falls. The southern range of hills is about 30 NM from the observer, the northern range about 50 NM from them to the north, and also about 20-30 NM from the Klamath Falls airport, the largest one within several hundred miles.

The object was within one hundred miles of this airport at the time the observer lost contact with it, and heading directly for the airport.

This fact alone rules out the possibility of a truck being the object sighted, and close scrutiny of the map reveals no roads on which a truck might have been visible to the radar beam at the necessary altitude. I leave open the question as to whether the radar will pick up a speed of 20 mph.


- page 2 -

A talk with a friend who has had piloting experience revealed that it is entirely possible for an airplane to be flying at that altitude, at that time, in that weather, heading for the Klamath Falls airport. He suggested that the landing lights on some # military craft are comparatively large, and could appear much larger due to diffraction as it passed through the snow.

Another look at the map showed that the object may have been visible over a 70-mile path under ideal conditions. The position-indicator radar fixed a point about 18 NM as the crow flies from the observer, who must have seen the object a few minutes before that. Assuming a 20 NM visibility for the observer, the object covered 40 NM in 10 minutes, or 240 NM per hour speed. This speed is well within the range of twin-engine aircraft, and a small jet such as the T-38.

Suggestion: A small aircraft with its landing lights on flew over the path indicated at the time indicated. Size of light caused by snow diffraction; lack of noise caused by observer sitting in car with engine running, or wind noise, or both; landing light may have been on due to emergency condition.

It may be possible to check with the Klamath Falls airport and ask them about any arrivals at this particular time.

SUBJECT:    Unidentified Radar Returns - 19 April 1967

TO:         TDET(Major Quintanilla)

1.          From the information available it appears that:

            a.   Both search and height finder radars were functioning
                 properly.

            b.   Weather conditions were not likely to have supported
                 extraordinary electromagnetic refractions.

            c.   Visual observation was substantiated by radar.

2.          The report indicates that a derelict balloon was shot down
            on the succeeding day; although no balloons were released in the
            proper time frame, this balloon should at least be considered.

3.          Weather conditions do appear to have been that which would in
            theory support a charged ice particle plasma. The plasma would be
            visible to both human eye and radar. The orange color might have
            been a moon reflection as the incident occurred at 0410 hours
            between first quarter and full moon.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office has recently received several inquiries regarding the UFO sighting from Burney, California on 19 April 1967. As a result, we are re-investigating the case.

2. Request information on the specific type of radar on which the object was painted. Were any measurements made as to speed and course of the object, if so, what were they? What is the period of time for an antenna rotation?

3. It has been proposed that the target which was picked up on your radars could possibly have been a truck. A map of the area indicates that there are mountains in this area with elevations near 3,000 ft. Do you feel that a truck could have been painted by the radars? If so, is this considered routine for your station?

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

A review of our records indicates that no balloon flight was launched by AFCRL on 18 April 1967. However, a balloon flight of 34.5 hours duration launched on 18 April 1966 is-sue of "Atmospheric Research". The flight path of this balloon launched from Holloman AFB, New Mexico was in a northeasterly direction with termination performed near Washington C. H., Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanillas:

I recommend that the evaluation be changed from ionized plasma to unidentified since there is nothing in the data to support "a charged ice particle plasma". In the first place, the term "ice particle plasma" is meaningless to a physicist. I, at least, do not know of any ice particle plasma that is giving white, travels slowly and is visible for approximately 10 minutes. This appears to be a purely ad hoc evaluation and is open to the severest criticism.

Since this case has also been submitted to the University of Colorado, I suggest that we request an evaluation from them.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek

Dear Major:

I herewith return the Burney, California case. I was not aware that this was
the original copy, but now upon examination I see that it apparently is. Had
I realized this before I would have made a xerox of it before writing it with
me from Dayton.

At any rate, I wrote to Mr. Forrester, Shasta City Deputy Sheriff, to tell
him that on Sunday, November 26 at 7:00 P.M., I would call him for further in-
formation. (This is part of my regular plan now; I wish in advance to
advise witnesses I wish to interview, telling them when I will place a phone call
to them at a given time and asking them to be in readiness.) I found that
Mr. Forrester had been killed in an auto accident just three weeks ago. Very
unfortunately, he had quit his sheriff's job to Burney, California, "because he
wanted to get away from its camera" and accepted a job with the Los Angeles
Police Department whereupon just a few days after he joined them, he was killed
in an auto accident.

The case is still a good one, however, and our only chance of tracing down what
this "ice particle plasma" might be is to check with the radar squadron in
Red Bluff, Oregon. Since this is a military installation, I think it would
be easier if we placed an extra call to them next time I visit Blue Book.

I must apologize for walking off with the Saigon "For Information Only" case,
but the original has been returned. As far as I know I do not have any other
original copies. Unless you specifically got mixed up with a batch
of xerox pages. Rest assured that any original copies, should there be any,
will be promptly returned to your files.

I am still surprised that no further investigation was made of the Saigon case.
In its case like this, I am sure you must realize, that given the nature that
"the Air Force knows all about it" since to the average citizen it is incon-
ceivable that so striking a personal happening would go uninvestigated.

But be that as it may, this does not concern me directly. My job as called for in the contract is to continue to see whether I can find anything of scientific value in UFO reports. This task I am pursuing. I try diligently to swell "looking under the bed" techniques. I will leave such matters to people trained to do such things and try to concentrate solely on the scientific aspects of the work, whatever those may be.

1. We would like to thank 2d Lt. A. Secrest for his excellent analysis of the 19 April 1967, Burney, California, unidentified flying object sighting. It is one of the most comprehensive analysis that we have received from a support activity in FTD, in quite some time. The background data that Lt. Secrest provided in his analysis will enable this office to answer inquiries on this sighting with accuracy.

2. We are re-evaluating the sighting to that of a small aircraft with landing lights, as Lt Secrest suggests.

Attn: FAA/Mr. Wise

1. Reference a 19 April 1967 radar paint of an unidentified flying object which was reported to the Air Force through Adair AFS, Oregon. The initial message stated that contact was made by both range and height finders radars. In determining if the visual observation and radar paint of the same object is necessary for additional information on the radar contact, Adairch, distance, and height information are requested if available.

2. At present, it does not appear that the two unidentified objects were related. Adverse weather conditions at the time of the sighting would imply that the object visually observed would have been quite low in the sky.

Through: Chief, Airways Facilities Branch(SFO-400)
FAA SanFrancisco Area Office

On 19 April 67 at 1210GMT, I received a call from the Flight Service Specialist on duty at the Red Bluff Airport, requesting information on an object in the sky at 32 degrees Mag and approximately 50 Nm miles. He advised that Sheriff at Burney California had reported the object and He was concerned as to it being a possible hazard to air navigation.

I confirmed an object being at 32 degrees Mag and 48 N.miles. The Radar contact was observed on MTI video. This would indicate the object had some movement to it.

I then called the Air Force Height Section and requested the altitude of the object, if they had it on their Height Finding Radar. The operator advised that they did have the object on radar, and he measured it at 8000 ft. He also said that the object was moving vertically above and below that altitude by 200 ft.

I relayed the information to the Flight Service Specialist at the Airport and advised the MLO at the Oakland ARTCC.

The Flight Service Specialist advised that the Sheriff estimated the altitude of the object to be 3000 ft above him and that his location was near 5000 ft.

At the time of the sighting the Radar showed that the worst part of the storm was in a different location than the area of the sighting, with little or no weather in the sighting area. Electronic means were in use at the time to maintain precipitation returns.

The target size as seen on the radar would indicate the object to be smaller than most airplanes, but this could be deceiving due to the characteristics of the MTI system. The target quality was such that it lasted for 3/4 of an antenna revolution.

I hope this information is what you desire and can be of some use to you.
