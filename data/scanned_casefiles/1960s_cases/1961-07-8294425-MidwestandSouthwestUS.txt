10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round obj, bright blue-white with a faint tail or glow, looking like most not in motion. Disappeared as daylight not brighter. Tail 4 times width of obj, 30° above horizon at 050° azimuth. Appeared stationary.

11. COMMENTS
Bright reported has all characteristics of a comet. Science news weekly of 5 August 61 reports that a new Comet was discovered on 23 July in position reported by many of the witnesses. It is, therefore, concluded that these are observations of the comet.

SAUCER "FLAP" IN PENNSYLVANIA: It seems that saucers are still being seen as often as ever. In 1959, though the newspapers do not usually give them such big write-ups as they used to. On July 24th, Mrs. Anthony Rossi of Lower Makefield, Pa., was walking, looking out the window of her bedroom when she saw a lighted object, coming right at her. The window was open. After a moment it disappeared, and she noted its color as the moon, round, with no tail. Alternately it changed as though both had a smoky streak following after it. On the night of the 25th, six residents of Bristol saw a UFO blinking a giant red light at them. Mrs. Helen Hammel was the first to spot it. The UFO was hovering over the home of one of her neighbors. A similar sighting was made later the same night. The incident was reported to State F. Galley, assistant director of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, who admitted he was carried.
