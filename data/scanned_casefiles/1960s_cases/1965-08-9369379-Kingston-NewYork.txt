PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 16 August 65 17/0355Z

2. LOCATION: Kingston, New York

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 - 5 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual (BX)

7. COURSE: Northerly

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Satellite (Possible ECHO II)
Sighting characteristic of a Satellite report. Duration consistent with this evaluation.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Star-like object white with yellowish tinge. No sound trail or features noted. Seemed faster than other Satellites observed by the witness. Observed at 85 deg elevation, moving NE at 52 deg elevation. Observed at 45 deg elevation. 3-5 minutes. Binoculars used but didn't help. ECHO II was over New York at 1035 PM about 20 minutes before the reported sighting, moving NE at 52 deg elevation. ECHO II would be a possible object for the sighting. The duration is not inconsistent with a satellite sighting.

The following information is submitted in connection with a report received of an unidentified flying object, by the undersigned Officer on 17 Aug 1965. Information is submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2 14 a. through 1.

A. Description of the Object:
1. One (1); starlike
2. Same size as a star
3. Color was white with a yellowish tinge. No flashing lights.
4. One object
5. N/A
6. No discernible features
7. No tail or exhaust
8. No sound
9. None

B. Description of course of object:
1. The observer was watching the stars when they (his wife also) noticed the object appear to try to join up to another star.
2. The object was approximately 65 degrees or almost overhead of the observers, who were facing Southwest.
3. The object moved South to North and disappeared in cloud cover at an angle 45 degrees from where they first sighted it.
4. The flight path was normal until it appeared to join up with another star.
5. The observer said, "It was erratic in its motion," going back and forth around the other star.
6. The object proceeded on to the north at a rapid rate (faster than previously sighted satellites). And was lost in the clouds.
7. The object was observed from three to five minutes.

C. Manner of observation:
1. Ground-visual
2. Binoculars were used, but were ineffective for further identification
3. N/A

D. Time and date of sighting:
0352 17 Aug 65

E. Location of the observer:
1. Four miles west of Kingston, N.Y. 41-58N, 74-04W

F. Identifying information on observer:
1. Civilian
2. Age-53
3. Occupation: President of [redacted] dealership
4. By his position the observer is quite reliable. He displayed

an active imagination as to what the object was, e.g. "Spy-in-the-sky."

C. Weather and winds:
1. Clear except for a light cloud layer to the North.
2. Light and variable.
3. Ceiling- High scattered.
4. Visibility-7 miles.
5. 1/10th
6. No thunderstorm activity
7. Slight temperature inversion from ground to 15,000. SFC: 74 F
   a. Vertical temperature gradient attached.
   b. No. 2-7 obtained from Stewart AFB Weather service for 0000Z 17AUG.

H. No unusual Weather activity.
I. N/A
J. No air traffic and no weather balloon releases in the area.
K. Preliminary analysis: Possible satellite, the reason being that it was at a high altitude and its velocity. The other possibility is that it could have been a planet, which is highly doubtful in my mind.
