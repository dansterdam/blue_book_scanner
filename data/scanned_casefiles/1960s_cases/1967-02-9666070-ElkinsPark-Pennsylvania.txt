I AM WRITING TO YOU

A U.F.O.

ON THE MORNING OF FEB 17 (1967)
I WAS AT MY DESK, GATHERING MY
PAPERS UP INTO MY BRIEFCASE, WHEN
I SAW AN OBJECT IN THE SKY,
PULSATING.

Dear Maj.Quintanilla:

In reference to my rebuttal of the evaluation of my U.F.O. photo, Maj.David Stiles, suggested that I contact Dr.Gordon of Colorado University. He made no mention of the discrepancies in your evaluation, which I pointed out quite clearly. In my rebuttal, I cast a bit doubt on your evaluation, which you seemed to have ignored totally. I will repeat my rebuttal.

1.Point "A" of your evaluation says that it is a multiple exposure because of the overlapping frame outlines. Many rolls of negatives, both color and black & white, have frame lines. A contact print, a photo strip, which is what my negative was a part of.

2.Point "B" of your evaluation says that a definite cone shape exists on the top. That would be so, were it not a cone exists in your 8x10" enlargement. That cone is formed by the top of the negative being cut off.

3.Point "C" of your evaluation says that it is an unprocessed spot on the negative. If that is so, then why would I have taken a picture of the empty sky? Would I have known that a technician in the developing labs would crop out the background, so point "C", you said it was a multiple exposure, and now you say that it is a processing defect. Well, which is it? Is it a multiple exposure or a processing defect?

Please review your own evaluation and my new rebuttal. Thank you.

Cordially,
(age 13)

This man doesn't like our evaluations of his photos.
I don't evaluate the photos, the photo people do and
I'm stuck with their evaluation whether I like it or
not. I'm not going to change the evaluation and the
only thing that I will agree to is that this man has

he doesn't like our evaluation, then let him submit

Major Quintanilla

Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla,

The findings of your investigation of my U.F.O. sight-ing and photograph were forwarded to me by Major David Stiles (acting chief of Civil Branch, of the community relations division, of the Office of Information), from Washington, D.C.

There are several points of the analysis results which I feel I must dispute:

1. Point "a" of the results says that my photograph is a multiple exposure, that claim being erroneous. Exact multiple frame outlines on the right and left edges of the negative.

If you were to examine any strip of Kodak negatives, you would find that the negatives usually overlap on the edges. This I do not feel that this is sufficient evidence of a multiple


- page 20 -

exposure...

2. Point "c" states that the entire object was blurred with the exception of a definite cone shape on the tip. None of my pictures has any such cone on the top. Your said Black+white copy desk have such a cone, but this is because you have the top of the negative in the picture.

3. Point "D" says that "the general appearance of the image suggests that an unprocessed spot on the film". How could this be? I not only photographed this object but I also saw this object, moving, in the sky, with my own 2 eyes.

I believe that you should re-evaluate your findings.

Sincerely yours,

[The signature is blacked out]

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of October 5, 1967, to Major Quintanilla at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

We are sorry that you believe there are discrepancies in the evaluation of your photographs. However, you might be interested in sending the critical negatives to Dr. Edward U. Condon, 1005 JILA Building, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80301. His group is conducting an independent investigation of unidentified flying objects and is searching for a photograph of a bona fide UFO.

SAF-OICC/Wright-Patterson/J. Turnure/bp/19079/21 Sep67

SEP 21 1967

Dear [redacted]

Reference your unidentified flying object observation and subsequent photographs which you made on February 17, 1967, the Aerial Phenomena Branch at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, submitted your negative to photographs experts for analysis. The results are as follows:

a. An examination of the negative reveals this to be a multiple exposure. This is evidenced by the multiple traces outlines on both the right- and left-hand sides of the negative.

b. The size of the image relative to the frame size indicates the "object" was either very large or very close. Since no camera-to-object distance was given, a determination of size is not possible.

c. The image is blurred with the exception of a definite cone-shape on the top edge. With a fixed-focus camera of the type used, the blur could be caused by motion of the object, however, if this were the case, the cone-shape should also be blurred.

d. The general appearance of the image suggests that it is an unprocessed spot on the film.

In summary, your photograph was a multiple exposure and the image suggests a processing defect.

Enclosed is your original negative and an 8" x 10" black-and-white print. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[HEADING - PARTIALLY ILLEGIBLE]

This report is in reply to Blue Order number 67-106 which concerns a photographic analysis of an unidentified flying object. The photographs was taken on 17 Jan 1967 at Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.

In explanation to the Panel, I would like to be a little more specific about the multiple photo evidence on both the original and the negatives.

Two of the three prints do show some evidence that the "object" was very white. There is a considerable-to-good distance was given, a determination of the exact center of the self-same object could be made to study its characteristics.
