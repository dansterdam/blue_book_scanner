The image appears to be a page from an old report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. It contains a detailed description and illustration of the three planets that will be visible in the night sky in December 1964 - Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn. The text and diagrams provide information on the appearance, visibility, and location of these planets in the sky.

Transcribed text from the document:

ASTRONOMY

Three Planets Visible

The new moon, beginning the appearance of Jupiter, Mars and Saturn, will include a total eclipse of the sun as one sees it tonight.

By JAMES STOKLEY

The planets Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn - all will appear in the January evening sky, January observers can look forward to some interesting sights.

Only Jupiter, however, is shown on the accompanying chart, which is a map of the northern skies as they will appear on the first of the month. This is the only one of the three that can be readily seen during the early part of the month. Their appearance is similar to that in November, Saturn as high in the south, and Jupiter to the southwest, that it is not difficult to locate.

On the astronomical diagrams, Saturn is drawn as 30 times its normal size, simply to make it more visible. In reality, it is a very small object in the sky, scarcely visible to the naked eye. This is why it is not shown on the map with the other two planets.

During January, Saturn can be seen in the south and southwest, even before Jupiter appears. Thus it is easy to locate in the west in the early evening.

This month, Jupiter will reach its greatest brilliance for the season, about an hour before sunset and then slowly fade from view as it passes behind the sun during the closing weeks of the month. Its brightness is magnitude 2.0, even brighter than Saturn.

In the east, Mars will be rising earlier each night, the constellation of Canes Venatici, the great star, Arcturus, and the bright star Spica will be visible during the evening hours. Orion, the warrior, with his two first-magnitude stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, will dominate the southern sky.

Taurus Stands Higher

Still higher and farther right stands Taurus, the bull, with brilliant and reddish Aldebaran. And not too high in the sky is Cassiopeia, the queen, with her W-shaped configuration.

Above and to the left of Orion is the bright wishing group called The Pleiades, or Seven Sisters. To their left, the brilliant group are the twins, Gemini, with Castor and Pollux. To their left, making up the winged figure of Pisces Cetus, the whale, can be seen, and farther up, Perseus, the hero, with the head of Medusa, the Gorgon, at his feet. On the map of the northern half of the sky is, of course, the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Dipper.

To the southwest is the brilliant star Sirius, the Dog Star, in the constellation of Canis Major, the Great Dog. Below and to the left of Sirius is the faint but prominent group called the Orion Nebula. The Great Nebula in Orion is a mass of glowing gas in which new stars are being formed.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or in your explanation of your sighting.

The sighting occurred on the evening of may 7 1962 at approximately 11:30 pm. I was outside my home in Glen Falls, New York, looking up at the sky. There was a bright object crossing the sky from north to south that was moving very rapidly. It seemed to change direction to the west, then continued on its original course to the south. It was much larger than any satellite or star, and seemed to have a reddish glow around the edges. It disappeared from view after about 2 minutes. There appeared to be no sound or trace of the object. I was very surprised and puzzled by what I saw, as it did not resemble any known aircraft. I have seen satellites and other objects in the sky before, but this was very different and quite unusual. I would be very interested to know if anyone else reported seeing the same object that evening.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

UFO form continued

My attention was directed to an object in the sky, it was of a deep red color, and appeared to be a light, of some sort. The object was an irregular oval shape and seemed to be quite large, at least the size of a jet aircraft, and quite close, not more than a few hundred yards distant and at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet above the ground.
The object seemed to be slowly hovering, without any apparent means of support or propulsion. The object was close enough for me to see that it had no wings, tail or any other appendages such as is found on an aircraft.
The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes, the it began to move slowly toward the east. As it moved, the color faded to a pale orange and then disappeared from sight. This object was observed by several people who were standing with me at the time.
I am able to follow it by eye until it was out of sight. The weather was clear and the visibility was excellent. The object did not make any sound that I could detect. I have no theory as to what the object might have been, but I am quite certain that it was not any kind of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with.
Every detail of this sighting is fresh in my memory, and I could give a detailed description of the object if needed. I hope that this report will be of some value in your investigations of unidentified flying objects.

Dec. to East.
I had thoroughly of course

consideration did I determine
this was something from another

The object moved swiftly and
in a manner unlike anything
man-made I know of and held
a rapid speed. It then seemed
to disappear in twinkling.

UFO INVESTIGATOR

SIGHTING BY CANADIAN RANGER

On Dec 11, 1964, an unknown flying object with four equally spaced lights was sighted over British Columbia, Canada, by a Canadian ranger. Y. D. Dale, the ranger, reported this sighting to the R.C.M.P.

At first the lights would be coming towards them, and then the lights of the object would be swung around and the object would be going away from them. The lights appeared to be perfectly round, equally spaced, and pale yellow in colour.

When first observed, the object was about overhead, and seemed to be going at a high rate of speed, He then saw the object make a sharp turn and disappear behind a cloud.

The sighting was reported by the ranger to the R.C.M.P. Port Alberni office, and they in turn notified the air force by the quickest method. They checked with the airport and learned that no aircraft were reported in the vicinity.

Seen by Mr. and Mrs. William Marcy who reported the following to the State Police: They were driving east on Porter Dr at a point about 200 yards south of the intersection of Porter Dr and Rt. 9. As they approached an area and descended slightly down the street, they noticed a round object about a foot or more in diameter hovering about 25 feet above the ground and perhaps 20-30 feet away. It was solid white with no visible lights or markings. It appeared to have a metallic sheen. It was apparently stationary as they watched it for about 20 seconds until it suddenly vanished. They stated it was very quiet and disappeared in an instant.

A uniformed member of the landing lights were lost seen at airports where this phenomenon is observed. That this event was a landing as described in State investigation procedure is doubtful because of the speed and sudden vanishing of the object."

In the first instance, a green light was seen to move from west to east at a high speed, observed by security police at Cape Kennedy. On December 8th, there was an explosion at the Cape. The public information officer at the Patrick Air Force Base informed the security police at Cape Kennedy that there had been a missile explosion and that there was nothing unusual about the sightings. They were attributed to the explosion at the Cape. The sightings were from north to south course, and west of Cape Kennedy over the ocean. There was no explosion at the time and no launchings. Military authorities could find no explanation.

RENDEVOUS OVER BEREA

Berea, Ohio - December 8, 1964 - 9:20 P.M. EST

A businessman, who wishes to remain anonymous, called the Berea Police Department to report a strange sighting in the sky. These are the details as he gave them:

(David Nelson) was walking behind his backyard. He spotted a bright object in the sky, which he later described as a "rendezous" of four separate objects.

His calls brought his mother outdoors to see the sighting. At first they both observed the objects "hovering". Then they began to move about, separating and rejoining in what appeared to be a coordinated fashion. After a few minutes (5-7), the lights switched off and the objects disappeared. After a few seconds (.5?), the lights were again visible, continuing their strange manuvering.

David Nelson and his mother both concurred that at one point, the lights seemed to be arranged in a definite (but clear) outline. The smaller white singular objects were moving in and out of this formation, at times disappearing altogether.

There were no sound effects heard from the three objects, according to the witness.

The duration of the sighting was estimated to be about 15 minutes. It started thinking on and off, and the objects appeared to move about erratically, some 10-15 degrees in direction.

Just a few minutes later when they saw a large red light near the horizon, it was headed straight down toward the ground. It stopped suddenly about 5 feet off the ground, then shut off, and finally drifted to the ground. There was no evidence of a crash. 

At the same time, the original sighting of about 15 degrees of arc started blinking on and off, and then appeared to move off behind some trees. That was the end of the sighting according to the witness.

A number of County Park employees studying from Gold and his son observed an object over the park's main office at about 4 p.m. when it "circled past" in an east-west direction. It then seemed to halt in its course and make a tight turn and proceed in a northwest direction. The object was stated to be in sight about 5 minutes. The clouds could not, his son observed, account for this phenomenon. Gold said the object appeared to be an unusual weather balloon which ordinarily floats in one direction.

Green Light Shoots Over Omaha Area
Two Deputies, W.E. Employ Sight It
By Hub Ogden
Early this morning, around 1 a.m., two Sarpy County Sheriffs deputies on patrol northwest of Omaha saw a green light shoot across the Omaha sky early Friday morning.
W.E. Employ, and a Western Electric employee, Joe Golden, reported to Sarpy County Sheriff's office they saw the rare phenomena while on patrol about 2 miles south of Rainwood. Employ is a deputy sheriff on the southwest edge of Omaha. 
The light was described as a bright greenish-blue streak that raced to the southeast at high speed. It lasted but a few seconds. 
"I knew there would be a lot of phone calls about it," said Employ. "This is not the first time I've seen something like this."
The light was in the shape of an elongated tear-drop. The largest forward part was a brilliant, brilliant greenish-blue. It slowed somewhat toward the trailing end and did not light up the terrain.
It moved in front of them on a horizontal path.

The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Greenish-Blue Light or Fireball Seen in Sky Over Omaha". There does not appear to be any photograph included in this image.

Greenish-Blue Light or Fireball Seen in Sky Over Omaha
A high, swirling light in the direction of Western Electric was seen over Omaha at about 6:35 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 8, and was traveling slower than a meteor. 
It moved to the southwest and was lost from view at the horizon, according to Mrs. Anna Jones of Elkhorn, Neb.
She said it did not disappear over the horizon, but just went away.
Joe Barta, Jr. of 1327 N. Washington Street, reported to the newspaper from his bedroom window a pure white light, like a small ball, drop out of the sky and explode early Friday morning. He believed it was a meteor.
Mr. Barta said it was for a moment in the direction of Offutt Air Force Base.
The Sheriff's office and Mr. Jones made separate reports to Offutt Air Force Base.
An Offutt spokesman Friday said he could not comment except to say the reports would be forwarded to higher headquarters.
Ed Stepovich, chief of the Weather Bureau here, said bureau personnel did not see the light, indicating it was not an official weather report.
He said the length of time it was seen "seemed a little longer than usual for a meteor."
Absence of a similar reports from other parts of the Midweat indicate the light may have been just local. He said if the weather was clear, and if the light were high there should have been other reports.

Great Light Shoots Over
Omaha Area
Two Deputies, W. E. 
Employe Sight It
By Hub Ogden
Blue-white brilliance flashed
across the Omaha sky early
Friday, Dec. 4, as two deputy
sheriffs watched, according to
a W'estern Electric employee.
The deputies patroling on
Rainwood Road south of Rainwood
saw the object about 4:15
a. m., the employee said.
The object moved south on
Rainwood near an intersection
with paved 36th Street. 
Temporary Lane said it
was the brightest of three that
he has seen fall ling stars and it did not appear
to be one.
"I know there would be
more of these about it and
the thing I liked about it
was that it seemed the thing
was falling it I felt pretty good."
He Details From Sergeant Lang:
The light was in the
shape of an elongated leaf, 
The largest forward
end was a brilliant green.
The rear end trailed a
brilliant red-orange tail. 
It slowed down and did
not light up the terrain,
he said.
"It moved in front of
them on a horizontal path,"
Lang said.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 April 1947
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not satisfactorily covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
A - stepped out for some fresh air. As the house was on a hill, I could see a long distance. I saw what appeared to be a hundred stars out, scattered about, seemed to be in a line going in a circle. This was very strange, as I am used to seeing stars scattered about, and not in any particular order or pattern. I watched this for some minutes, and then a gray object appeared to come up out of the trees or hillside. This object appeared to be large, round, and somewhat flat on the bottom. It seemed to move leisurely across the sky, and then disappeared from view behind some trees. I thought at first this was an airplane, but there was no noise, no lights, and the motion was unlike any airplane I had ever seen.
I'll also admit that I have some proof - a written statement from two neighbors who saw the same thing I did that night. But I am some-what reluctant to furnish their names, as I do not want to involve them, unless it is absolutely necessary.
If this was a natural phenomenon, then I have never seen anything like it before. On the other hand, if it was something else, I have no idea what it could have been. It did not resemble any aircraft I am familiar with, and though I supposed it could have been some sort of experimental aircraft, the fact that there was no noise or lights makes me doubt that. In any event, I can assure you that what I saw was very real, and not the product of my imagination.

A P.S. to my Report. I am enclosing a newspaper clipping of a similar sighting which occurred in this area. The witness is a young boy and his story seems to corroborate the date & time of the incident reported. I would like to call your attention to this matter.

Also, please return the Blue Book as I am ready and interested in this matter. This matter has mysterious notes scribbled in the margins.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that includes a celestial timetable for January.

the Northern Hemisphere, and of autumn the Southern Hemisphere. The Sammer begins for us, will come June 21 at 10:56 a.m. EDT. The Autumn will start Sept. 23 at 2:25 p.m. EDT. The greatest eclipse of the Sun in 1965 the most important, will be on July 20, at 3:10 p.m. EST. It will be farther south. Then another will take place between the winter and spring in 1966, visible across parts of the Pacific. The next total eclipse will be on March 7, 1970, most observed across eastern states from California to Washington.

A partial eclipse of the moon, on the nights of June 15-16, will be visible in South America and eastern parts of North America. A partial eclipse of the sun, visible from southwestern Asia and many Pacific islands, although a ring of the sun will not entirely cover the moon, will occur on July 20.

The next total eclipse will occur around the South Pole, last Aug. 2, 1966, but even where it will be visible, in Europe and Asia, only a partial eclipse will be able to be seen. Because of the moon's greater distance from the earth at that time, it will not entirely block the sun.
