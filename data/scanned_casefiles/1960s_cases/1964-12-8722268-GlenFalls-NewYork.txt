SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for December 26, 1964

Three Planets Visible
The new year, beginning with the appearance of Jupiter, Mars and Saturn, will include a total eclipse of the sun as one highlight.

By JAMES STOKLEY

►THREE BRIGHT PLANETS—Jupiter, Mars and Saturn—will appear in the January evening sky, joining the bright stars normally visible.

Only Jupiter, however, is shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the skies as they look about 10 p.m. your own variety of standard time, at the beginning of the month. Their appearance is similar at nine in mid-January, and at eight as the month ends.

Jupiter shines so brilliantly, high in the southwest, that it is not difficult to locate. On the astronomical brightness scale, it is of magnitude minus 2.1.

In the evening sky, it is the brightest planet. Although only about a 20th as bright as Jupiter, it equals a first magnitude star. Thus it is easy to locate in the west in the early evening.

Mars, on the other hand, rises just too late to be the first of the month, about an hour and a half before midnight, and earlier in the following weeks. Standing in Virgo, the virgin, which is just below Leo, the lion, its magnitude is 0.2, even brighter than Saturn.

Taurus Stands Higher

Still higher and farther right stands Taurus, the bull, with brilliant and reddish Aldebaran, the first magnitude star just to the right of Taurus, in the next-door constellation of Aries, the ram.

Above and to the left of Sirius is the lesser dog, Canis Minor, with the brilliant star called Procyon. And right above this group are the twins, Gemini with Castor and Pollux, the two first magnitude stars.

In the northwest you can see Ursa Major, the great bear. Part of the group forms the Big Dipper, with the "pointers" indicating the direction of the horizon.

Near the horizon and toward the east is part of Leo, the lion, with Regulus. Although this is a star of first magnitude, its low altitude will increase its brightness. This is also true—to an even greater degree—of Deneb, in Cygnus, the swan, just above the northwestern horizon.

Looking ahead to see what 1965 has in store for us in the skies, we find that one of the features is an approach of the planet Mars. Now rising late in the evening, it will come up earlier and earlier until March 9 when it will be directly opposite the sun. Then, of course, it will be visible all night, rising at sunset and setting at sunrise.

About the same time it will make its closest approach to the earth of this trip around the sun. Its minimum distance, on March 12, will be 62.1 million miles. Such approaches of Mars, which come about every two years and two months, vary considerably in distance and this will be a poor one. In the future each approach will be closer than its predecessor, until August 1971. Then Mars will be only 35 million miles away—offering astronomers a good opportunity for inspection.

Jupiter will continue to be prominent in the evening sky until May. On the 30th it will pass behind the sun and after that it will become a morning star, rising before sunrise. By autumn it will be visible in the evening and on Dec. 18 it will be opposite the sun, shining all night.

Saturn to Disappear

Saturn will soon disappear from view, for it passes behind the sun on Feb. 26. Then it will become a morning star, rising in the east before sunrise. By summer, it will again be prominent in the evening, rising in the east after sunset. It will be in superior conjunction with the sun on April 11. By midsummer it will be visible easily in the evening, and will increase in brightness until it reaches its maximum on Dec. 21. This will make it a conspicuous Christmas star.

The sun's apparent annual movement around the sky, which is really due to the earth's motion around the sun, will bring it directly over the earth's equator on March 20 at 3:05 p.m. EST. This is the vernal equinox, the beginning of spring in 1971.

[The rest of the text appears to be a handwritten narrative, which reads as follows:]

On that afternoon I was in my car driving along close mercury arc highway. The sun was to my left and back, almost directly back.

I saw a man and a big body lying in the sky. They seemed so intent. That I stopped and looked out my left window. When my eyes went level with the power line across the area I saw the object it moved very evenly and smoothly like a satellite but slower. After a few minutes it seemed to fly & for visual compression locally, not militant, a jet.

Very simply like a fighter would move into my line of sight. The object seemed bigger than the jet when close. This may have been because the jet was near the foothills which is quite a distance from El camino.

Here is the text from the document:

UFO form continued                                                Page 8

[Handwritten text, partially legible:]

After standing still seemingly, the object to my
argument, diminished in size very rapidly
then it really and distinctly higher than the
into it resumed its westward motion.

I say this object being higher than seek became I think
an help in establishing speed, size & height. At first
the object was behind the clouds. These clouds are others.
The object was 25-30,000 FT high, then it changed
to 15-20 times smaller. It then
was seen with difficulty and disappear between clouds about
clouds, appearing only when there a break in the
clouds. Luckily I was able to follow it by using
electric wire to guide my eye. But then
then though I remained for perhaps two minutes
fixed at the spot, I was not able to see it again.

To my memory, no glint of sun lit on it,
differently no vapor trail. It did not change shape
color nor was there a visible radiation
from or anything setting out from its surface that would
estimate its size to be the same as 4 square
blocks, perhaps larger.


- page 14 -

Mr. Quintanilla,

His may belive that the object
I saw had to be proved in
order to fly against the jet
with with possible from west
to East.

I had thought it was a follow
until I remembered this, that is
only I did not report it.

I also felt that if it was
something from another world
that was nothing to be gained
in forcing it exists since we
would never catch it and make
use of it.

UFO INVESTIGATOR

SIGHTING BY CANADIAN RANGER

On Dec. 4, 1964, an unknown flying object with four equally spaced yellow lights was sighted over British Columbia by Forest Ranger Donald M. Hawkins and a companion, V.G. Bate.

At first Hawkins and Bate thought the lights could be coming from the cabin of a low-flying aircraft, but when they got out of their car they could hear no sound. The UFO traveled at approximately the speed of a DC-6 airliner. The lights were "perfectly round, equally spaced, and pale yellow in colour."

When first observed, the object was about one-fourth of a mile away, at which time it was measured as the size of a dime behind a cloud. After a few moments, the UFO disappeared behind a cloud.

The sighting occurred between Burns Lake and Smithers, B.C. When the witnesses arrived at Smithers, they checked with the airport and learned that no aircraft were reported in the vicinity.

The AF on being notified, said that none (G-134) which fly over that mountain area, or any other planes were missing. An attempt at explanations was a report that a lumber mill or pile wood was on fire in the area. No further reports.

LOCAL SIGHTINGS

Dec. 7, 1964... 8:35 P.M... Prior Dr., Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio
Sighter - Sandy Vulck... Mrs. Vulck was backing her car from
her garage when she caught sight of an extremely bright light
moving from an object to her left at an elevation of approx.
30 degrees. As she straightened the car to proceed down the street
she decided suddenly to follow it. It was to no avail however, as
the brilliant yellow-white light was moving no fast that it disap-
peared after she had followed less than a block.

It remained her of the landing lights on planes when at airports
when planes come in for landings, except that this was a single
light. It was round and no wings or fuselage was seen. She heard
no sound. The object was seen under cloud cover. It seemed to her
that the speed was very great because the object diminished to a
pinpoint of light so quickly.

Cape Kennedy, Florida
5 & 8 December 1964

NEWS BRIEFS. On December 5th and 8th, sightings of UFOs were made at Cape Kennedy, Florida. In the TAFB (Patrick Air Force Base) area, a green light was seen to move from north to south at very high speed. This was observed by thousands of people in the area, many of whom believed erroneously that there had been an explosion at the Cape. The public information officer at nearby Patrick Air Force Base issued a press release stating: "Security police at Cape Kennedy have reported a blue and silver object traveling at a high rate of speed on a north to south course, and west of Cape Kennedy over the ocean.....There were no explosions at Cape Kennedy at the time, and no launchings." Military officials could find no explanation....

RENDEZVOUS OVER BEREA

Berea, Ohio --- December 8, 1964 ... 8:20 P.M. EST ... A roaring, interference-ridden, TV set, a UFO conscious young man trespassing the property of an irate landowner, and startling happenings in the sky, these are the facts.

David Meckl, 16, rushed out into his backyard. He spotted a bluish-white object "over" and "moving" back and forth, to the West.

His calls brought his mother outdoors in time to see the object as it moved toward and over them in urging flight.

The boy ran S.S.E. The object was moving in a smooth curve to the street crossing Bevan. When he was about 7 or 8 houses down that street, and with the large blue object in his clear, two white, dim-like objects were seen alongside. When the two smaller objects were closing on a large object, they suddenly stopped; there was a merging and the two objects disappeared. After a few seconds (5-8), the remaining large object continued eastward, rising gradually and eventually fading.

"It was as if they were sucked up by a vacuum cleaner," said David. No sound was heard from the three objects, no trail, no change in color or brightness. In estimating size, digital blue-white object was about 2 times Jupiter in length, (digital at 30 degrees elevation). It was large enough to see a definite (fat cigar) outline. The smaller white objects were about 1/4 as large.

After scanning the sky for a few minutes, the boy returned to tell his mother what he had seen.

It was just a few minutes later when they saw a large red light approaching from the S. It was headed N.E. at low altitude. When it reached a position directly east of them, it stopped in mid-flight. Looking at it through the trees, the object was at elevation of about 15 degrees. It started blinking on and off at about second intervals.

Soon, David was inside the house for his 7x50 binoculars and camera. When he returned, the object was still stationary. He crossed Bevan, and ran full tilt down the alley until he had crossed the next street E. In his excitement and determination to get a better look, he was "carried" into the yard of one of the houses bordering the alleyway.

Suddenly he was in the grasp of the irate landowner, who proceeded to shake him and accuse him of trespassing. No amount of explanation or attempts by the "baron" to take "peeping Tom" David off the premises after some hot words, relented.

He had tried to explain about the red light to the man, but he was already "seeing red".

He looked, found the object, but before he could get that better look, it climbed upward and disappeared. David was left with a traffic light at relatively close range.

No sound or trail, no details seen. Overall time of sightings: 15-20 minutes. Four objects seen.

David: The attitude of the (first) bluish-white object guessed to be about 30 degrees elevation, much slower than planes usually seen. The two white objects that rose up from the first (?) might have been rising from different directions, arcing in from horizon at high altitude. (corrected)

No color change or brightness change according to David. No color change or brightness could be seen, but changed somewhat orangish color as it passed over. Weather clear to somewhat overcast. An hour later it was overcast. TV: no further trouble that night. This area is full of large trees. Cleveland Hopkins International Airport just a few miles away.

Montrose, Colorado--St. Highway Patrolman found the image of a UFO on film exposed at 11 a. m. on 13 December 1964. He was shooting pictures of the Bureau of Reclamation Operations Office south of town. At first thought the object was a speck of dust but by enlarging it 20 times he brought out a clear image of an object with "definite markings."

It then seemed to halt in flight and made a right turn and proceeded into the south above the clouds. Goold said his son observed a similar phenomenon about 2 p.m. The same day (28 December 1964) while riding bikes on Day Road and it appeared to be flying over Mt. Madonna.

BLUE-GREEN OBJECT PASSES OVER AKRON

December 29, 1964... Sgt. Louis Hunt, of the Akron Police Department, reported a high-flying object going SE, at very high velocity (3 to 6 times swifter than a jet). He was of the opinion that the round blush-green object was at very high altitude. Its size was compared with the planet Venus as seen near the horizon. No other lights were seen. No sound or trail. First seen at 40 degrees elevation. It blended into the stars at about 20 degrees elevation. It was in view about 30 seconds. Location: On N. Firestone Blvd. near Brown Street.

Green Light Shoots Over Omaha Area

Two Deputies, W.E. Employe Sight It
By Hub Ogden

An unexplained greenish-blue light or fireball flashed across the Omaha sky early Friday.

It was seen in two points by deputy sheriffs and a Western Electric employe.

Sheriff's patrolmen Sgt. Dan Lang and Joe Golden saw the object about 4:14 a.m. as they drove north of Irvington on Highway 133, south of Rainbow Road.

It traveled on a level trajectory from northeast to southwest.

Sgt. Lang said it was the sort of thing that "takes your breath away."

He said he has seen falling stars and it did not appear to be one.

"I knew there would be a lot of joking about it and when I heard about it the Electric man seeing it I said, 'Let pretty good.'"

Details from Sergeant Lang:

—The light was in the shape of an elongated teardrop.

The largest, forward brilliant green.

The color was a rare one into orange at the trailing end.

It glowed somewhat like a neon light. It did not light up the terrain.

—It moved in front of them on a horizontal path

Headline: Greenish-Blue Light or Fireball Seen in Sky Over Omaha

Text:
[First column partially legible]
It was in view for 40 to 50 seconds. It appeared to be at an altitude of five hundred to one thousand feet and at an angle low enough to be seen from the car windshield.

Its distance from the officers could not be judged.

An employ of Western Electric named Millard, Richard Jones of Ashland, reported a similar object about the same time.

He said he and two other employees, Bonnie Stevens and Sharon Mack of Omaha, saw the light for about five seconds at a time that could vary from 4:10 to 4:14 a.m. It was bluish-white with brilliance that resembled welding flame, he said.

[Continues in second column]
and was traveling slowly, then a meteor.

It moved to the southwest and was lost from view as it went behind a building, Mr. Jones said it did not appear high nor far away.

J. Joe Barta, Jr. of 1507 Washington Street, reported he saw from his bedroom a pure white light, like a small ball, drop out of the sky and explode early Friday morning. He believed it was a meteor.

Mr. Barta said he was in the direction of Papillion. He did not know the time.

The Sheriff's office and Mr. Jones made separate reports to Offutt Air Force Base.

An Offutt spokesman Friday said he could not comment except to say the reports would be forwarded to higher headquarters.

Ed Siegowicki, chief of the Weather Bureau here, said bureau personnel did not see the light.

He said the length of time it was seen "seems to be fairly long time" for a meteor.

Absence of similar reports from other parts of the Midwest indicate the light may have been low and local. He said the weather was clear and the light should have been other reported ports.

An attendant at the Federal Aviation Agency control tower at Epply Airfield suggested jet planes sometimes are mistaken for mystery lights in the sky.

It was seen at two points by deputy sheriffs and a Western Electric employe.

Sheriff's patrolmen Sgt. Dan Lang and Joe Golden saw the object about 4:14 a.m. as they drove north of Irvington on Highway 133, south of Raywood Road.

It traveled on a level trajectory from northeast to southwest.

Sgt. Lang said, "It was the sort of thing that 'takes your breath away.'"

He said he has seen falling stars and it did not appear to be one.

"I knew there would be a lot of joking about it and when I heard about the thing I felt pretty good," he said.

Located in Nashville, at 3 Loyd Way. Some school friends and I were up until summer 1964, at which time our family moved here to Nashville. Father is Cadet in Air Force in Administrative Branch, stationed at Sewart Air Base now, was stationed at SAC HQ, OAFD in Waco, Texas. While babysitting for friends, kids were asleep, I stepped out on the back porch at which time I saw the object.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
No one. Tried to phone local Radio station in Omaha, but line was busy, so after two tries I made a call.

Official U.S. Air Force

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 April 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

As stated above, I stepped out for some fresh air, as the house was kind of stuffy. It was a clear, crisp December night and there seemed to be hundreds of stars out. I was looking at them when the green object suddenly appeared and dropped out of sight in a swirling, panoramic I just steed there, staring at the spot where it had been. Then I went inside, tried to call the radio station where I was, but no one was on. I made a sketch of the object while the incident was fresh in my mind, including date + time.

Now I admit that I'm a science fiction fan and like monster movies and all that, but what I saw wasn't brought on by my "sci-fi" subconscious.

If what I saw was a natural phenomenon, then at least it must be a once and never read of another sighting of the same type. I've heard of the "Green Fireballs", but this wasn't a Fireball!

I'll also admit that I believe saucers are real, but I'm not entirely certain what I saw was a spacecraft. I know it was a proper witness, but I saw some thing weird. So even if it does turn out to have been a natural phenomenon, instead of "Unknown" nothing said, nothing lost.

A P.S. to my report, I am enclosing a newspaper clipping of a similar sighting which occurred in Oneida which is only about 10 miles from OFFUTT. I've forgotten the date I cut it out of the paper but it sometime in August. Submitting this report, I would like to request a copy of the Blue Book as I am greatly interested in this modern mystery!

There will be four eclipses in 1965, the
most important a total eclipse of the sun
on May 30. The path of totality, about
150 miles wide, starts west of Auckland,
New Zealand, then passes over the Pacific
Ocean in a northeasterly direction toward
the equator. It ends at the coast of Peru.
At the middle of the path, the moon will
obscure the sun for the unusually long
time of 7 minutes. The path of totality
along the path will be well populated with
astronomers on that date. In Mexico,
Central America and the northwestern part
of South America, a partial eclipse will be
visible.

A partial eclipse of the moon, on the
night of June 15, will be visible in South
America and the eastern part of North
America. On Nov. 21 will bring an annular
eclipse of the sun, visible from southeastern
Asia and many Pacific islands. Although
the moon will pass in front of the sun,
it will not entirely cover it. A ring of the
solar surface will be visible around the
dark lunar disc.

The year's last eclipse will come Dec. 8
but even where it will be visible, in Europe
and Asia, you would hardly be able to see
anything unusual. This will be a "penum-
bral" eclipse. That is, the full moon will
enter the outer part of the earth's shadow
—the penumbra—where our planet partly
ally hides the sun. The moon will be a
little dimmer than usual when full, but
much different sunlight will shine on it
that the effect will hardly be noticeable.
