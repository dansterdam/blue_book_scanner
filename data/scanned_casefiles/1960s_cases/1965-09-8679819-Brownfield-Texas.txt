K. Capt Harry D Logan, FV3006280

I have investigated the UFO report by Mr [redacted] on 21 Sep 65 in accordance with AFR 200-2. No other incidents of this type had been reported to the Sheriffs Office, Dept. of Public Safety, FAA or Lubbock Municipal Airport. A thorough check of possible IFR air traffic and satellite tracks has revealed nothing. It is impossible to determine at this time what Mr [redacted] observed. He has sighted many objects of the same type at varying times throughout the past year. This is the only time he has reported one. He has observed many aircraft and some satellite tracks. He says he moves at a much slower speed, yet seen to be at a much greater distance. As investigating Officer, I have been unable to make any reasonable assumption with the limited data available to me.

L. None.
