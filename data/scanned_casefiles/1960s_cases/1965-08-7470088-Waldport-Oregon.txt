Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in reply to your request for an evaluation of an aerial object which you observed on 4 August 1965.

Your description of the object indicates that it is similar to the many reports of satellites which we receive. However, the information included in your letter is insufficient to firmly establish its identity as a satellite. It is requested that you complete the enclosed PDD Form 164 so that a firm evaluation can be made.

Sincerely,

Reference the attached letter from [redacted] requesting information on his observation of 4 Aug 65. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear [redacted]:

The description of the object which you observed is similar to many satellites recently received by the Air Force. Duration of 15 seconds is rather short for this type of observation and you did not include the traditional in-flight course was moving.

It is requested that you complete the attached FTD Form 164 in order that a more firm evaluation may be made.
