Unidentified
Object in Sky

An unidentified object, described by viewers in Meriden as a "satellite, but moving in an erratic course," was reported yesterday by Donald Blakeslee, 19, an astronomy major at Wesleyan College, said he was called in to observe the object by George F. Baxter, 18, of 9 Grove Street; Richard Wright, 16, and John Addich, 17, all of this area. 

Blakeslee said the object, which appeared to be traveling from northwest to northeast, "was too slow to be a satellite, and seemed to stop completely for a short while, and then speed up again." 

The strange, moving light, in addition to the youths' mentioning, was also observed by Mrs. Dorothy Blakeslee, Donald's father, and by Donald's brother Keith.

The image does not contain any photographs, it only shows text in the form of a block of text describing various individuals and organizations related to the International Union Against Cancer. As an OCR system, I will output the full text found in the document:

"Some at the capitalistic coun-tries:
Prof. V. R. Khanolker, vice chancellor of the University of Bombay, and our outgoing president of the International Union Against Cancer, was sponsoring a resolution that while the cancer problem is global, the way to attack it must be local, that is local problems demand local solutions. 
Prof. Alex Haddow of London's Royal Cancer Hospital who took office as president of the International Union during the congress, stressed that ultimate progress for better treatment for cancer through chemical attack "may have come."
He cautioned against overoptimism, but declared that research findings in various fields since the last war hold out the promise that our knowledge of the disease is advancing steadily, despite the fact that so far no specific treatment or cure has been found.
He called upon the delegates representing a set of principles and practices called the "International Union Against Cancer," which sponsors a congress every four years, to dedicate themselves entirely to advancing the effort to find a solution to the problem of cancer.
Now an affiliate of the World Health Organization, the union is an outgrowth of the first international congress held in Madrid in 1933."
