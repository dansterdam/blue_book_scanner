APPENDIX III o 265

Most of the text in the document is illegible due to the low quality of the scanned image. The only clearly readable text is the page number/label "APPENDIX III o 265" on the right side of the page.

The image appears to be a form or table with multiple columns, but the details are not discernible due to the poor scan quality.

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely faint and illegible. While the document seems to be a scanned page with text, the text is so light and blurry that I cannot confidently read or transcribe any of the content. The page looks like a typewritten document with multiple columns, but the details are not clear enough to perform accurate OCR.

Unidentified
Object In Sky

An unidentified object, described by viewers in Meriden as a "starlike, but moving in an erratic course," was reported late last night by Donald Blakeslee, of 187 Broad Street.

Blakeslee, 19, an astronomy major at Wesleyan College, said he was called on the street by George Dodge, 18, of 37 Gravel Street; Richard Wright, 16; and Jan Aldrich, 17, all of that area.

He said the object, white-colored, traveled from northwest to northeast, when I was lost to view behind a clump of trees. He described it as "moving too slow to be a satellite, and maintaining a zig-zag course." He said a "gleaned brightly for minutes, then seemed to stop completely" for a short while, and then shine again.

The strange, moving light, in addition to the youths mentioned, also was observed by John H. Blakeslee, Donald's father, and by Donald's brother Keith.

Here is the text from the document:

Prof. V. K. Khankhar, vice Chancellor of the University of Bombay, and outgoing president of the International Union Against Cancer — sponsoring organisation of the congress — declared that while the cancer problem is not yet solved, "we have come a long way toward it."

Prof. Alex Haddow of London's Royal Cancer Hospital, who takes office as president of the international union during the congress, asserted that ultimate prospects for better treatment of cancer through chemical attack "are rather exciting."

He cautioned against overoptimism, but declared that research findings in various fields since the last war had put "the prospect that our knowledge is beginning to crystallize" in a set of principles for attacking cancer.

The International Union Against Cancer, which sponsors a congress every four years, is the only international organization devoted entirely to advancing the effort to find a solution to the problem of cancer.

Now an affiliate of the World Health Organization, the union is an outgrowth of the first international congress held in Madrid in 1933.
