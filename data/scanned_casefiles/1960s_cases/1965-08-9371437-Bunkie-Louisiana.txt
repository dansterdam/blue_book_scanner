Chief, Project Blue Book

Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of unidentified objects or phenomena, I believe that you have a copy of my report and photos. Due to the nature of these objects or phenomena, they could not all be reported on form 164, as there were many of them on two nights, as you will learn from my report.

Also, I believe that Form 164 might confuse things, as many of the other forms, similar to it, that I have attempted to fill out have, in my report, which I took several weeks to prepare, I have presented the total story and the inter-relations between objects, in the most orderly and scientific fashion possible, having had the report commented by several UFO investigation groups, among them, NICAP.

As for the negatives, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared between Lincoln and Valentine, Nebr.

If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have not explained other than in my report here, I will be quite willing to talk with your people.

Very truly yours,

JAH/ink

Here is the text from the document:

-2-

The antics of subset C1 are most interesting. When C appeared from behind the trees, what was its angular rate? About that of Cl, faster? The disappearance, you say, took place in a matter of seconds, but what about the travel of C and C1 to their rendezvous point?

I wish you would expand on the astronomical seeing conditions — and the transparency. Were there any clouds at all? Any haze? What was the limiting visual magnitude of stars visible to the unaided eye? Was there any noticeable twinkle to the stars in the immediate vicinity of the objects B1 and C1? Did the lights you saw themselves twinkle in a star-like manner? And why were you looking at the extra-focal image of the lights? What did they look like in focus?

By the way, I did not receive any copies of the photographs. Were these returned to you, and if not, who has them now?

And re object D: When the airplane came by, how many seconds did light D remain off?

If I cannot get to Los Angeles myself, and if the data continue to warrant deeper investigation, I could ask one of my friends in the Los Angeles area to talk with you if you would permit — perhaps Mr or Mrs ______. He is extremely busy right now, but I hesitate to ask Alan Sandage as he might be unwilling to be my lab assistant. But we shall see. Let's see how things develop and whether we can come up with a physical theory for your experience and apparently that of many other people in the midwest on those evenings of early August.

Are the other witnesses to your experience available for answering a few of my questions? I could find an enough. Then I do hope that yours not become tired of answering questions. Many principals in other cases I have investigated have complained of the onslaught of questions from the idly curious and I hope you have not been bothered too much. Thank you again.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

Miss J
Glendale, California 91202

Dear Miss:

Major Quintanilla has forwarded to me some correspondence relative to your sightings of August 2 and 3, 1965; including a copy of his letter to you of February 24, 1966. I want to compliment you on the form and detail of your report. You will be named some professional investigators!

I was going to put in a call to you or Dr. and Mrs. Form in New Mexico the other day I had a bad and broke my jaw. So I am wired up now, but not for sound. But in the event that I would like to have same points cleared up, I can make myself understood on the phone with some effort, and so I ask your indulgence in advance should I call.

The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that came in to the Air Force of sightings made on the nights of July 31 through August 3, 1965. I am hoping that your report, plus a personal interview or at best a few photo calls, will help us to a great many loose ends together. It is entirely possible that something of considerable scientific value may come out of this investigation. I therefore earnestly solicit your cooperation. I imagine you and your friends are an anxious as I am to solve this mystery. I can assure you that I will give this particular problem my personal attention, as it interests me greatly.

I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained angular rates and altitudes, although I wish you had made a time-sequence plot of altitudes and azimuths, and close passages to stars. Perhaps you can still do this from memory. Are you going to visit in Valentine, Nebraska again this summer? If so, it might be interesting to re-enact the crime with the sky setting the scene. Might I ask a few questions as a starter?

I assume that objects A, B1 and C1 were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 2-3, and that only object b was visible on the night of August 3-4. Is this correct?

Abilene, Kansas
4 Aug 65

TRUCK DRIVER CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER IN KANSAS! One of the weirdest incidents of the current world-wide flap occurred about 25 miles south of Abilene, Kansas, shortly before 2 a.m. on the morning of August 4th. Don Tennepils, a truck driver from Beatrice, Oklahoma, reported that he was driving north on Highway 15 when all of his lights suddenly went out. Just then, a flying saucer passed over the truck with a "sizzling or wind-like blowing sound," searching the ground. The mysterious object was only 20 feet above the ground, and about 100 feet in front of the truck. Tennepils screeched on his brakes, thinking that the UFO was going to land right on the road, but it slowed toward the south and west.

The object was 15 feet in diameter, orange in color, and was shooting off reddish rays of some sort. It seemed to be about two feet thick, with a four-foot-high hump or dome in the middle. This protrusion may have had a window in it but Mr. Tennepils, who was completely unnerved by the experience, was not sure on this point.

the fly was object seemed to
drift on the air currents

Observations Below theory was held
out of the picture but the following

At an altitude of 1200 to 1400 feet

UFO Report

This is a report of a call from the 4th of August 1965 case of wife, mother and some neighbors. There was a mix-up here.

One object they saw in the west seems most likely to have been Venus - it was stationary. A few nights later they saw Echo, but the primary sighting remains unexplained. None of the witnesses, that is, neither Mr and Mrs, are exactly a bright light, but I got most from Mrs. They generally agreed on the fact that they were facing northward one evenings, shortly after dusk, and nearly overhead they saw a very bright light, very much brighter than any other star, which moved erratically, went out, came back to the site, moved, stopped, grew brighter when it stopped, and kept this sort of thing up for about 45 minutes, wending its way slowly down from nearly overhead to about "6 inches off the end of the moon". This establishes the fact that it made an appreciable arc across the sky, and hence rules out a twinkling star.

It does not rule out a balloon, if said balloon was carrying a variable light.

The identity of the object remained the same because she said they watched it the whole time. She said it would move, then stop, turn brighter, then move again. It was the color of a star. Apparently quite a few people saw it, because a police officer came to their apartment saying that some young girl had reported it. The police officers apparently got there too late to see anything. However, they said that they had reports from all over the city about the strange object. The case is sufficiently interesting to send the 164 Forms to them, and I am so doing - several of them, so Mrs. can get the neighbors to fill them out also.

The only legible text in this image is the header at the top of the page which reads:

Please refer only to the object sighted originally nearly overhead and not to the object in the west or the satellite sighting of a few days later.

The jfilled-out forms should be mailed back to me.

1. Reference is made to the request for radar analysis of scope pictures of 35 mm microfilm reels 65-26 and 65-27 from ICT Wichita, Kansas.

2. More information is required before analysis can be performed. Due to the number of targets that appear on this type of radar and changes that occur, it cannot be ascertained which targets are suspect.

3. In order to perform an analysis of the scope pictures, the time, range and azimuth at which the alleged UFO's appeared are required.

The sudden drops down from

air currents, up to this point.
Hovers the abrupt way it held

and then plummeted 20-25
feet straight down over this

and the fact that this flowing
of jets blinking lights dilated
and then suddenly turned to a
steady darker crimson red
-while at hovered motionless
over this one spot on the island

to me. Then an ordinary
over water balloon drifting free
with the changing air currents
could suddenly drop - almost
thought of one. Sure. But it
was impossible that such a
steady balloon could hover motionless

previously and not been observed. Some of the objects reported are undoubtedly stars or planets, however stars do not generally fall in an upward direction, neither do they move at low level parallel to the earth's surface with both a horizontal and perpendicular movement.

e. The only estimate of possible cause which can be offered is that the lights and moving objects are due in some way to the temperature inversions which existed at the time.

1. Reference AFR 200-2 as amended, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base is located in an area which has recently experienced a considerable number of reports pertaining to unidentified flying objects. On the night of 31 July 1965, several civilians of Cheyenne, Wyoming reported to the local radio stations various objects generally with red and green flashing lights. These were relayed to the Francis E. Warren Command Post. All missile sites were immediately contacted and alerted to be on the watch for such objects. As a result, the following number of sightings were reported during the following three nights:

31 July     - 75 objects - observed by 70 personnel
1 Aug       - 29 objects - observed by 27 personnel
2 Aug       - 44 objects - observed by 46 personnel

Totals 148 objects                 143

2. Description of Objects. Reported objects are mostly round, although there are reports of oval/cigar-shaped and pencil-shaped, or merely a light source. Reported sizes vary from the size of a pinhead to a nickel when seen by the naked eye, and from the size of a half dollar when seen through binoculars. Where sightings involved more than one object, V-shaped, echelon, cross, box and tail-shaped formations were reported. On August 1st, there was one daytime report, from a civilian source in Cheyenne, of an oblong object tumbling through the sky and in the distance becoming two objects before disappearing in separate directions. There were no discernable features, except that most reports stated that colored lights were flashing on and off at one to two second intervals. Sometimes becoming alternately bright and dim. (See Atch 1.) Possible tails were reported in a few cases. There has been no sound reported in association with any of the objects. All of the moving objects were to the northwest, north and northeast of the observation points.

3. Description of Courses of Objects. The early observations were somewhat accidental and perhaps incomplete. In that light and/or movement caught the eye of the observer. Subsequent observations were the product of intentional surveillance prompted by earlier report.

Saw by now having my
first week studies...

Both times this flying object
exhibited breath to having little off
at phenomenal sales of speed
(but to sea) only to return at
approximately the same rate of
speed to "drop down" and
hover motionless over this one
particular spot over mt. Bauer
Island.

By now (this time)
I was quite certain the flying
object was for certain in 8 to
5 miles determined again as had
first yet stood out the probably
of this. With being some kind of
U.S. Air Force experimental flying
source type aircraft (logic if
had first appeared coming from
the mainland where at key
important S.W. Base was located
(now Air Force Base) near Range
Maine... just 13 miles distant
However once again the erratic
flight pattern (the ability) having
motion the sweep & supporting
passes over the islands the
sudden drop down over as give

Objects appeared at elevations from the horizon ranging from 0° to 900 and at various azimuths through all four quadrants. No discernible pattern of flight is apparent from analysis of reports. Some objects were alternately stationary and moving, sometimes in level flight, sometimes climbing, sometimes descending. Reported speeds ranged from zero to orbital speed (one observer drew a comparison with TELSTAR speed); many reports of "high speed" movement. Maneuvering included "hovering," up and down movement, gradual changes of direction, sustained climbing/descension, and possible landings (two reported cases which later investigation failed to confirm). In one case, the object moved across the sky at high speed then stopped and remained in position for a considerable length of time. Objects disappeared from view either by horizon limits, by local terrain obscurance, or by fading out, usually quite suddenly. Some objects were visible for only one minute or less, while others were viewed, by naked eye or with binoculars over a span of a few minutes (5 - 15) to as long as several hours. All observations were ground visual, most often with the aid of 7X50 binoculars.

4. Time and Date of Sightings: All reported observations occurred during hours of darkness or near darkness (dawn), beginning at approximately 05002, 1 August 1965, and continuing during similar periods of the following two nights, with the most prominent sightings being after midnight.

5. Location of Observers: In most cases, observers were located at various Minuteman launch control facilities in the area north of Cheyenne, Wyoming, east through the Nebraska border and southeast in Colorado. In a few instances, observers were roving security guards driving vehicles in the area. Others made observations from the roofs of control centers. Most of the objects sighted were toward the east.

6. Identification of Observers: Most observers were young (18 - 21 years of age) combat defense force airmen on duty in Minuteman missile areas. A few observers were young missile maintenance men; others were mature NCOs. All observers are considered to be reliable and intelligent. Only a few have had aircraft experience and, few, if any, have had prior experience in observing aerial or space phenomena. Colonel Williams and other personnel of the Sioux Army Depot near Sidney, Nebraska also are included among those who made the sightings.

7. Weather and Winds Aloft Conditions at Time and Place of Sightings: Observers reported dry, cool, CAVU conditions, generally; there were no thunderstorms in the area and negligible cloud cover throughout all three periods. Temperature gradient and winds aloft (based on 1200Z soundings):

35 KTS.

The 1200Z sounding on 1 August revealed primary temperature inversions
at the surface and at 11,000 - 13,000 Feet, and a smaller inversion of
temperature at 28,000 - 29,000 Feet. The 1200Z sounding on 2 August
revealed a primary surface inversion, and a smaller inversion at
13,000 - 14,000 Feet. The 1200Z sounding on 3 August revealed a
primary surface inversion. A lighted weather balloon was released
from Cheyenne at approximately 0500Z on each of the three days.
Definite correlation with a reported UFO sighting was possible in
only one case, no correlation with aircraft movements.

8. General Comments:

a. Due to the great number of sightings, specific reports on each
sighting are not being forwarded, however all reports will be kept
for reference.

b. In several instances, sightings were verified by other
observations from neighboring control centers. Binoculars were
available at all launch control facilities.

c. Due to length of duty tours and distances involved, many
reports were taken by telephone and are somewhat sketchy. Personal
interviews with returning crews revealed more accurate information
with sketches, diagrams, degrees of altitude and general characteristics.

d. There were reports of falling stars, however the men seemed
to be able to distinguish the difference between stars and other
unusual objects. The launch control facilities are generally located
in isolated areas with unhindered vision in all directions. The
combat defense personnel are accustomed to night duty and it seems
hardly possible that these unusual objects would have been present

Sighted at 0515 z, one bright light. It was observed by a Tech. Sergeant Powers and Airman 1st Class Anderson from the base weather station. At first it was approximately 10 degrees above the horizon. Southeast of Cheyenne. Then moved roughly northwest until it was directly overhead of Cheyenne. No sound or propulsion and it was the approximate size of a half dollar. Bigger then a pea, huh? Yea. Weather was clear, visibility good. It was observed for approximately 5 minutes. OK. And when it moved northwest the speed was very rapid and the color of it was reddish orange. OK That's it.

After lately a nice black colored dream of light up "as being clock
to many and stately curving here
I was accordingly down on the observation spot

But relating to this unique flying
object experience of last Sunday
up at Northeast Harbor, Maine
I said. My wife (Mrs. Irene Clark) was more
impressed by the fact that this
underdyfield flying object was
more than usually made "no sound". Mrs. Morris, at
all, despite its erratic flight
behavior pattern. Flashing lights
at all. This seemed to my view

Mrs. Clark most of all.
"Then suddenly this "thing"
whatever it was slicked past
over the sea onto the island
once again, and stopped as
before - Simply, yet astoundingly
by true, just hovering motion
view was that exact same
spot on the island. There it
repeated its spontaneous due
maneuver back out side, the

DUTY OFFICER NOTES

1 Aug 1965 - Dept Shelling USAF Command Post called OTOCO1

1 Aug Near Cheyenne Wyoming, Mr Jones Camp, a local radio announcer reported

13 - 20 telephone calls about an object over the city. The object was large,

circular with several colors and no sound. It had red and blue blinking

lights. Two NCO's and one airman controllers (outside) said it began to

move in a NE direction very rapidly. Two sights had it on binoculars. At

0107, a security guard at E site, which is approximately 35 miles east of

Cheyenne, reported that he was observing an object with binoculars. He

described the object as cross shaped with two projections coming from it,

located like arms. Light in the center was flashing red and green. The

sights has the object in sight at the present time. At 0507 the object

was directly over base operations. Since then, various reports have come

in from missile sites. No fighters were scrambled.

1 Aug, Capt Johnson, Base Command, Francis I Warren AFB called PTO.

He said that the remaining officer of the Sioux AFB Depot saw five objects

at 0300. Sgt Johnson said that at 0506, SAC Command Post reported three

sights and confirmed 3 UFOs previously given over 2 sites. At the same time,

two more appeared, one from the North and one from the NE. Two objects

appeared to be at 50,000 ft and the at 30,000 ft alt. Forty people are

now observing these objects. At 0340, B Flight reported that from 50 - 100

miles from Sidney, Nebraska, on a heading of 330°, a UFO fitting the same

description was sighted. It appeared to descend below the tree line and at

ground with no explosion. There was no radar observation. At 0840, members

of B Flight saw what appeared to be the same UFO. The security teams were

dispatched from B Flight to the area to investigate. At 0950, nine more UFOs

sighted. At 10052, the object appeared symmetrical. Colors appeared
to be blue, red, and green. The whole object looked like a white oval at
between 20,000 - 40,000ft alt. No radar at this time and no size can be
determined. There appeared to be from one to nine groups in no pattern or
formation. No features, trails or sounds could be determined.

c' 11052, received another phone call from Col Johnson thru SAC command post.
He said that at 10002, 4 Flight reported nine UFOs in sight - 4 to the NW

Colonel Kizer, Ready to go. Okay this was reported to me at 1246 by 15th Hq from Warren. Reported to Warren at 1030 by Strike team 6/Airman 3rd Class Williams and an Airman 2nd class Diviny. They were 5 miles west of Delta 4 sight which is approximately 60 miles east northeast of Cheyenne. When they got within 10 miles of it and the road they were on ran out. They did not leave their vehicle to continue on. They were watching this object through binoculars. They report the object was very large with red and white flashing lights, led to white white back to red. The object was on the ground while they were observing it. And while they were watching the object appeared to rise 500 ft. and move off in a northwest direction. They watched it for 10 to 15 minutes through binoculars before it faded out of sight. Another Strike team that was dispatched did not get within 15 miles of the object. And they reported only seeing lights no visible objects, only lights. That's it. NORAD has this. No. I will pass it.

2nd 5-72 "MG" Sgt. 4 MG Station.

Just went for minute in one
determined spot and my pure
mind dog tag and intelligence
forbade me to believe any fact
of flight Balloon could perform
such a fate. With no drift or
movement from one spot in a
turned period of ten minutes.
All my intellect was seeing and
intellect against my own desire
all direction... these flying object
suddenly seemed to behave with
flashing flight and almost
took off at such speed after
put once the Atlantic Ocean
at an unbelievable able rate of speed
and one I would say and guess
at being between 1000 to 1500
miles per hour from a lead
stand still. My act did not build
up any sudden take of movement
sure, but just took off at an
incredible rate of speed...
And with it went my observation
Balloon theory, too.

Then said only these pulled the
U.F.O. sites suddenly into what

Air Staff Summary Sheet
UFO Report - 8/28/65

Location: Corner of Pond and Berry Roads, Berry, New Hampshire
Date: 28 August 1965
Time: 26:40 P.M. EDT

SUMMARY:
Acquired a newsclip from USCAP taken from the "Manchester Union Leader" dated 28 August 1965. Informant was a radar operator at Civil Scout Headquarters as they live with Mrs. [redacted] at her address and telephone number.

ACCOUNT:
There were several people at the way to Ogden AFB from a public well. They saw something unusual in the sky. They noticed that at 19:00 to 19:15 a number of aircraft using low cut of the south were in the area. These aircraft, some noted as having a reddish, hazy projection, Indiana, radar, and other ground observers saw a formation of 6 to 8 aircraft. The accompanying discussion back revealed the presence of a sighting of the phenomenon.

FTD (TDEW)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
30 August 1965

Dear Mr. [redacted]
Bismarck, North Dakota

The unidentified flying object observations which you reported to Air Force officials at Minot AFB, North Dakota have been forwarded to Project Blue Book for evaluation. The general characteristics and duration of the sighting indicate that the objects which you observed were astronomical and were distorted by a strong inversion throughout the midwest.

We are conducting a study of the many reports of this nature for the period during which your sighting occurred. Positional data of the object/objects were not included in the initial report. We are attaching an FTD Form 164 and would appreciate your completing it and returning it in the envelope provided.

The Air Force appreciates your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

NEWS RELEASE: 2 Aug 65, 1530 hours

Initial study of the majority of reports thus far received by the Air Force indicates that the observations were astronomical in nature. The objects most likely observed were the planet Jupiter and the stars Rigal, Capella, Betelgeuse, or Al-deb-aran, which are clearly visible in the eastern sky. The time of the reported sightings, the azimuth and elevation of the reported sightings supports this conclusion. In addition, on August 1st and 2nd the temperature distribution and varying wind speeds observed over the Great Plains, from northern Texas to Wyoming, were favorable for the phenomenon, known as scintillation. Some of the reports were the aquarid meteor showers which occur between 25 July to 5 August. The meteors approach from the southeast and streak swiftly across the sky trailing sparks. There has been no confirmation that any of the sightings reported were tracked on radar.

The weather was scattered to heavy clouds. 30 minutes later a thunderstorm

[The rest of the text contains multiple paragraphs, but due to the image quality and edge cutting, I cannot confidently transcribe the full text without potentially introducing errors. Some words and phrases are visible, but not enough to provide a complete, accurate transcription.]

There are two black redacted sections in the middle of the document where text has been deliberately obscured.

The document appears to be a report, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing some kind of observation or incident, but without a full clear transcription, I cannot specify the exact details.

REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS IN OTHER AREAS. AIRMAN WHITE CONE OF THE
GROUP THAT FIRST REPORTED THE OBJECTS) STARTED HIS NARRATIVE OF THE
SIGHTINGS BY STATING THAT HE HAD HEARD SUCH REPORTS ON THE RADIO
AND BEGAN LOOKING AROUND THE SKY TO SEE IF HE COULD SEE ANYTHING
UNUSUAL. IN HIS LAST CALL HE SAID HE WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THE
OBJECTS WERE STARS.

THE RADAR SIGHTING WAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE RAPID CITY AIRPORT
AND COULD HAVE BEEN A LIGHT SLOW MOVING ACFT (ALTHOUGH NONE WAS
REPORTED BY THE AIRPORT). EVERY REPORT EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ONE CAME
AFTER PERSONNEL WERE ALERTED AND COULD HAVE BEEN A RESULT OF SUG-
GESTION. IN SUPPORT OF THIS THEORY IS THE REPORT OF THE SUPERVISOR
OF FLYING, MAJOR EDGAR A. CARROLL. HE SPENT OVER AN HOUR SCANNING
THE AREAS WHERE SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED AND SAW "NOTHING BUT STARS".
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MAJOR CARROLL IS AN EXPERIENCED PILOT
AND MUST BE CONSIDERED A MUCH MORE RELIABLE SOURCE THAN THE OTHERS.
ALSO TO BE NOTED IS THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION BETWEEN 12,300 FT.
AND 12,300 FT REPORTED DURING THE TIME OF THE SIGHTINGS. THIS MAY
HAVE CAUSED DISTORTION IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE STARS WHICH WERE

Here is the OCR text from the document:

Major Dadler Yeh Is this Major Warren? Do you want a copy of this
UFO? No I just walked in were and I got my feet wet but I guess I'll
be competent from now on. Well, this is the thing I got so many
reports on this that I don't know--what's your last entry on it?
Let me take a look. Sac team at sight a hotel 2. 1000 z. Let's see--
1000 Sac team at 10-okay do you have a good atmosphere? We have
out out standing man here with his pencils sharp. Go ahead. Okay
let's run from that 1000z to make sure that's what I'm talking about.
Sac team hotel 2 reports UFOs directly over head. Right. Hotel one
at the same time observed the same object said it looked red and
green and somewhat star shaped. 1012 Warren reports UFO 50 miles
east of Cheyenne heading east at a high rate of speed and descending.
It appears to be a blinding bright color. New entry 1017. East of
Cheyenne reports one oval object. One oval object high and white.
With white lights on the side, and a flashing red light in the
center moving east. Are you estimating any altitude on any of these?
No, I just passing them right on. These reports come in faster
than we can copy.

I do have some altitudes coming on in subsequent reports so will
get those okay? Sight on this one? Same 1017. One appears to have landed 10 miles
east of the sight. A Sac team has been dispatched.

New entry. Okay. 1020. Echo sight reports 7 UFOs. East of the
sight 20 to 30,900 feet. Okay

1025 Echo reports 6 UFO stacked vertically. Okay. What entry
was that? 1025.

1027 Golf 1 reports 1 ascending. Its climbing. Right. Same
time Echo two reports to additional UFOs have joined the 7 from
the 1020 entry make it a total of nine. Okay.

1028 Golf 1 reports the UFO ascending still further and going
east. Another one at 102 degrees azimuth level and going from
south to north.

1042 z. Golf 1 climbing UFO has leveled off. Okay. Tibet sight
reports the bright one still climbing higher. Tibet now has two
visually. Due east of the bright one. With four northwest of
the sight and three east of the sight. There now appears that there
are nine objects north of Cheyenne and 5 east of Cheyenne.

1040. Golf reports 1 at 070 degrees. 1 at 120 degrees. 3 came
from the east stacked vertical passed between the other two and
all 5 are now heading west. As quickly as I been getting them
in to NORAD and then calling you and I believe I've decided
to stay with this sequence. Are you feeling this into that
set up at Wright-Patterson. Yes that's correct. Fine. How about
if it is agreeable with you for me to call Warren--well let's leave
it as it is I believe Warren will be following this up with
written reports. Okay we want to keep real current on this. I think
there will be major interest in this real quick. And your name
again Major Wolmers. ████████ Any comments from NORAD?


- page 196 -

Are they taking any action? No NORAD is getting several reports from reliable sources of these own interest. Namely people in the various defense sector regions. What have been reporting something.

Now are you still there? Right. Listen there's one entry here I believe you'll get let me see. Yeh, 235 CO of the CO Army Depot at Sydney, Alaska reported 5 UFOs heading east. That was at 0935 I believe I did pass on up. Right. What is the weather conditions at this time and the visibility? Hold on one sir. Okay, Colonel, yes. SE 1 is reporting clear and 15 and the conditions of darkness. What is it now is it daylight? Stand by 1 sir. Colonel, Okay go ahead. They just about passed the twilight and the sun is beginning to come up. Right, so some of these observations have been made under twilight conditions. Well sir, I would say some were but most were made in periods of darkness. See the first entry we have on this was at 0700z. Right I have been here all night and I've been listening to everyone of them. Well let's see the last one was 1040 and that would be just about 30 minutes ago and the sun is just about breaking so I would say on the last one was seen at 1017. I would estimate it began around the end of twilight. Keep us posted this is starting to look interesting.

Yes sir, well pass on as quick as we get it after we pass on to NORAD. Okay thanks. Bye.

No radar pickup. Are you getting any sightings other than those that are reported from the SAC people? We had reports from our people out at the 5th region and the 29th region. Are these numerous and about the same pattern from SAC. Right. Just about identical. Well okay, as long as we're following directions here we think we were setting numerous sightings when our SAC was . Well we've had this reported to us by our team. He had similar reports from the objects in the air from our sources as well as from SAC. Does this reach a point where your instructions require for you to make an aerial observation? We have no such instructions. No. Okay thank you.

Colonel Kier. Ready to go. Okay this was reported to me at 1246 by 1st Lt Warren at 1030 by Strike team by Airman 3rd Class Williams and an Airman 2nd class Delving. They were 5 miles west of Delta, a sight which is approximately 60 miles east northeast of Cheyenne. They were trying to check on object when they got within 10 miles of it and the road they were on ran out. They did not leave their vehicle to continue on. They were watching this object through binoculars. They report the object was very large with red and white flashing lights. Red to white were back to red. The object was oval in shape not round. They say that the object was on the ground while they were observing it. And while they were watching the object appeared to rise 500 ft. and move off in a northwest direction. They reached it for 10 to 15 minutes through binoculars before it faded out of sight. Another Strike team was dispatched. Let our steno catch up here just a second sir. Okay. Another Strike team that was dispatched did not see with 10 miles of the object. And they reported only seeing lights no visible object. And they said it. NORAD has this. No. I will pass it.

MARTY CHRAN REPORTER FROM NEW YORK CALLED ON 3 Aug 65.
Gave him the basic information on current UFO flap in the midwest.

MARY JOE NELSON REPORTER ON THE OKLAHOMA CITY TIMES CALLED on 4 Aug 65.
Tinker PE had a clip on their radar. They had stationary object for
forty minutes. Do not know the exact date. This probably has no
correlation with other objects. From telephone conversation with Tinker
it appears to be a stationary object. Miss Nelson said like a tower.

Also explained to her that the explanation for the Oklahoma sightings
could not be made until we had received the official reports. Tinker is
making the reports to us. Explanation for stars that the Air Force
gave was in regards to sightings over in Cheyenne and Kansas occurring
between 0100 hours and 0430 hours. Therefore the astronomer at the
Planetarium in Oklahoma was correct when he said that the stars were
on the other side of the earth at the time of the Oklahoma sightings
(2100 - 2400). He and the Air Force are talking about completely different
sightings. It was an unfortunate thing that the Oklahoma sightings had
been connected with the sightings over Kansas and Wyoming.

How soon we get the reports depends on how fast Tinker is able to get
the reports, investigative data, typing etc all takes time and especially
since there has been such a rash of them.


- page 198 -

Told her that an official statement will be issued from the Pentagon. We submit our findings to the Pentagon. We have no reports from South America, Argentina, etc. Thats there business. Maj said he could not comment regarding he is a private citizen. I have a high opinion of have talked with him several times in the past few days. he appears to be a fine guy. He is a private citizen and can say what he wants to, I have no bones to pick with him. said a UFO exploded over Texas a week ago. We have not heard of this. said fragments were hitting a car, and that they are being analysed at some laboratory. We have no information regarding this. Maj said that wants to send it to us we will analyze it. He said one radio station reported that a UFO rose from Lake Hickman and that a fisherman was taken to a hospital in some. Ambulance driver could tell the truth. We had not information on this either. Reports are a lot of emotional. We have a flurry once the wire service pick it up. Everybody has been looking at the sky.

5 Aug 65 - COLORADO - (AFS)

Col Dugan requested information on the current missile test. Sgt Moody gave complete briefing on the current flap and our position.

4 Aug 65 - Sgt Bergstrom AFB

Are we interested in this stuff that has been happening in the past few days. Sgt Moody told him to submit raw data andplace it in an envelope. Newspapers are generating a lot of reports. He said something moved from Zenith to the North Star.

Two Girl Scouts
Spot UFO in Derry

DERRY, Aug. 26 - Two girl
scouts reported today they
saw an unidentified flying
object hovering and maneuvering between them at
8:30 p.m. last night just outside this town.

Dorothy Dunn and Patricia
Knowles, both of Derry, said
they were walking in Black Derry,
and were watching looking
over the green store when
they spotted the flying object.
Describing its movements, they
said it was "hovering" and
then "went straight up."

The girls described them as
being white and round. They
said it was about the size of
a dime held at arm's length.
They claimed the object was
going up and down and sideways.

They claimed the electrical
wires near the green store
were "vibrating" when the object
was near.

MISS NORTHRUP, NAVY, COLUMBUS, OHIO - 4 Aug 65

They are preparing a program, wanted permission to have Major Quintanilla to talk on it. SAPOI said that he couldn't appear because they were having a current flap. They had had the program prepared for quite some time and now all of a sudden the Pentagon up and says no. She was quite upset and wanted Major Quintanilla to be on the program. Major said he was not in the public relations aspect and he would have to do what SAPOI directed him to do. She then suggested Dr Rynck be on the program. She had talked to him and he said he would be in Dayton during August 1965 and could be on then. It would be up to Major Quintanilla. Major said he would see what SAPOI had to say. Any statement must come from them, any authority for radio and television appearances etc. She said she didn't want just NICAP on the program. Her program is going to be on the 25th of August. Said she would come to Dayton, or we could come to Columbus.

Major Quintanilla was informed on 5 Aug 65 that neither he nor Dr Rynck could be on the program. On 5 Aug 65 Major Quintanilla informed Miss Northrup of SAPOI's decision.

Capt Romalick (Ops) Information Officer, Ellington, Texas - We have a rash of people calling in about blinking things in the Houston. Assistant Ops wants to talk to the press and given them a statement. 90% of these cases are blinking lights. Told them that any press release must come from SAPOI. If you can identify the cases there is no need to forward them. However if identification is not made do forward them. Was very insistent upon wanting a statement to get the press off their backs.

Once again informed them that a statement would have to come from SAPOI.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL FROM FRED WHIPPLE FROM THE Wall Street Journal, Texas

he had talked to Major Quintanilla at his residence a few nights ago and asked him to call back at the office during office hours to obtain statistics.

Sgt Moody gave him the figures which were reported to the Air Force. We only investigate reports made to the Air Force. Told him that a case may contain 50-60 reports. The Air Base nearest the sighting does the investigation. He asked how many people worked on the program and how long does a person work on an unidentified case. Since each air base does its on investigation there is no set number of personnel working on cases except for the ones here at Wright-Patterson and SAFOI. We feel that some of the old statistics are wrong. It would be nice if we had the time and knowledge of what happened then to go back and reevaluate these cases. Mr Zimmerman said he realized that this was impossible. We have had bigger flurries at different times.

(1) Purpose of this program: (1) Security such as a threat from a missile.
(2) Scientific and technical information, satellite decays, ball lightning.
(3) Public relations aspect. People ask about these things. Probably if a sighting is reported a Sunday but does not appear to be significant the reporter would not ask final report until Monday. We've had one hoax and 7 unreliable reports so far this year. A very small minority are hoaxes. We never doubt the witnesses work. No effort is made to ridicule the person making the report.

Explained that the statement regarding stars was in error. The statement pertained to the sightings at Wyoming and Kansas for the time 0100 to 0400 hours, not in Oklahoma at 9pm the night before. We don't know of any Air Force jets being sent up. A check with ADC regarding airplanes being sent up should be made if he is interested. Then he does his feature article he will send us a copy.

A spate of Unidentified Flying
Object (UFO) reports over eight
Western states Sunday night and
early yesterday were no cause
for alarm, according to Wright-
Patterson Air Force base investi-
gators.

The agency said the reports
resulted from natural phenomena."
spokesman for the Project Blue
Book office said. The agency
handles all UFO reports for the
Air Force.

Only one sighting remains to be
explained. It was made by the
Wichita, Kan., weather bureau
which observed as blips on a radar screen UFOs of a type reported over at least six states.

Another radar sighting from
Tinker Air Force base, Okla.,
which was a ground target
sighting, was up on the radar
screen.

The spokesman here said what
hundreds of persons saw Sunday
night and before dawn yesterday
was the planet Jupiter or its
moons, which can appear as discs
does not pick up planets or stars.

Robert Bisson, director of the
Oklahoma Science and Art foundation planetarium in Oklahoma
City, said watchers in Oklahoma
certainly did not see the planet
or stars the Air Force listed.

"That is as far from the truth
as you can get," Bisson said.
"Somebody has made a mistake.
These stars and planets are on
the opposite side of the earth
from Oklahoma City at this time
of the year."

Four or five blips at a time
were picked up on the ground
radar at Wichita. Watchers, including many law enforcement
officers, saw things that ranged
in appearance from flashing
lights of various colors to egg-shaped objects.

Reports of sightings by citizens poured in from Kansas, Texas,

Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska
and Wyoming. Oklahomans probably saw the most.

The earliest sighting was at 9
p.m. CST (8 p.m. EDT) Sunday. The latest was at 6 a.m.
CST (5 a.m. EDT) yesterday.

Ellis Pike, first assistant meteorologist at Wichita, said the
blips "looked much the same as
an airplane might." He said
they were "small and rather
distinct." Each blip had a fading
effect; it would brighten and then
dim.

Pike estimated the objects
moved at about 45 miles an hour.
Radar picks up cloudy formations, but Pike said nothing was
nothing in the atmosphere Sunday to produce the blips seen on
the Wichita weather bureau radar.

Deputy Sheriff Everett Tucker
at Wellington, Kan., and his wife
said they saw an object "gliding in the sky" about 4:50 a.m.
CST (5:50 a.m., EDT). It had a
reddish vapor trail and moved
rapidly toward the north, Tucker
said.

A Wellington policeman looked
at one object with binoculars. He
said it was about three car
lengths, egg-shaped and moved
in an erratic manner along
a straight path.

Saucer Reports
Flood Oklahoma
[Continued from Page One]

OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 2 (UPI)—Dozens of reports of mysterious, multi-colored objects in the sky swamped police and newspaper switchboards across Oklahoma.

The highway patrol said Tinker Air Force Base authorities reported tracking some of the objects on radar early last night, but Tinker officials later refused to confirm or deny the reports.

The objects were described as emitting various colors light. Some were said to be flying an erratic course in diamond formation.

There was at least one unconfirmed report of an object resembling a flaming plane crash near Bartlesville.

At least eight law enforcement officers were among Oklahomans who reported seeing the unidentified flying objects.

The Daily Oklahoman described the rash of telephone calls as reminiscent of the Orson Welles Mars invasion panic of Oct. 30, 1938.

Reports of four mysterious objects (Cont'd on Page 6, Column 3)

craft flying in diamond formation came from Chickasha, Cushing, Shawnee and Claire, Okla.

Some of the first reports came from Purcell, 20 miles north of Wynnewood, where the highway patrol said an unidentified flying object was picked up on two radar screens early Saturday.

Officers in three patrol cars at Shawnee said they watched the diamond formation flight for 30 to 40 miles. They said the strange craft moved in a northerly direction and changed colors from red to white to blue green. They said the objects hovered near side to side at times.

[The Weather Bureau Wichita, Kan., confirmed reports of unidentified flying objects over a wide section of south central Kansas early today.]

Deputy Sheriff Everett Tucker of Wellington said he and his wife saw one of the mysterious objects moving "rapidly to the north."]

Cushing officers also observed a formation of four unusual objects. Their description of the changing colors was similar to the description given by Shawnee police.

At Chickasha, Patrolman C. W. Barnhill reported a kite-shaped object with a red light on top.

Sightings also were reported at Wichita Falls, in north Texas, and at Borger, Pampa, Dalhart, Dumas and Tulia in the Texas Panhandle.

TRUCK DRIVER CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER: One of the weirdest incidents of the current world-wide flap occurred about 25 miles south of Abilene, Kansas, shortly before 2 a.m. on the morning of August 4th. Don Tennopir, a truck driver, reported he was driving north on Highway 15, carrying a cargo bound for Lincoln, Nebraska, when all of a sudden all of his lights went out. Just then, a flying saucer passed over the truck with a "sizzling or wind-like blowing sound," scaring him greatly. The mysterious object was only 20 feet above the ground, and about 100 feet in front of the truck. Tennopir screeched on his breaks, thinking the UFO was going to land right on the road; but it moved on toward the south and west. The object was 15 feet in diameter, orange in color, and was shooting off reddish rays of some sort. It seemed to be about two feet thick, with a four-foot-high hump or dome in the middle. This protrusion may have had a window in it, but Mr. Tennopir, who was completely unnerved by the experience, was not sure on this point.

Probably Stars, Says AF
People Seeing Things
All Through The Sky

OKLAHOMA CITY—Reports of mysterious objects that float, sit and speed along in the atmosphere came in from Minnesota to the Mexican border yesterday.

Most of the sightings, which the Air Force said probably were more than planets or stars, were in Oklahoma and North Central areas.

It was the third straight day of UFO watching, one of the most persistent periods of the space age.

Watchers who saw Air Force objects he saw flying in the sky were Oklahoma City last Sunday.

It looked like it had a flat bottom, and it was not a time sphere. The observers around it and the rings were a cast of the main body.

Another weather observer in Oklahoma City said he saw what appeared to be a typical "UFO" that later turned out to be a weather plane.

Two newsmen came up with pictures of UFO.

One of them, Bob Campbell, a radio newsman from Sherman, Tex., watched a bright flare in the sky for about an hour and a half. He said it did not move while he was watching it.

A picture he took of the object showed a slightly oval burst of which bobbed up and quickly darted about.

One report said the object appeared to be spotted green on both sides with a bright red light on top.

The Air Force said a variety of stars and planets are probably responsible for the rash of reported UFO sightings.

"Initial study of reports received would indicate the observations were astrological in nature," the Air Force said.

The photographer for the Junction City (Kan.) Union said he took a picture which showed what he said was a UFO. But he did not see the dots when he took a picture of a skyflyer plane he developed the shot, but they don't look anything like objects.

Junction City is about 100 miles south of Wichita, Kan., where tracked several UFO objects flying about a half-hour.

The northernmost sighting early yesterday came at Blaine, Minn., and Friday, Minn., two suburbs of Minneapolis. Police officers touring the area reported seeing a bright object.

OKLAHOMA CITY—Reports of mysterious objects that float, sit and speed along in the atmosphere came in from Minnesota to the Mexican border yesterday.

Most of the sightings, which the Air Force said probably were nothing more than planets or stars, were in Oklahoma and North Texas.

It was the third straight day of UFO "watching."

One of the most persistent spotters was an Air Force weather observer who said the objects he saw flying in the sky over Oklahoma City last Sunday were "no mirage."

He said he had a flat round bottom, and it was not a true sphere. "The observer said the object was round in and the rings were a part of the main body."

Another weather observer in Oklahoma City said he saw what appeared to be a "typical UFO" that later turned out to be a weather balloon.

Two newsmen came up with pictures of UFO.

One of them, Bob Campbell, a radio newsman from Sherman, Tex., watched a bright flare in the sky four about an hour and a half. He said it did not move while he was watching it.

A picture he took of the object showed a slightly oval burst of which bobbed up and down.

The photographer for the Junction City (Kan.) Union said he took a picture which showed eight black dots in the sky. He said he did not see the dots when he took a picture of a skydriver parachuting in the ground. But when the developed the shots, the dots were there.

The photographer, George Gonder, said the dots were not caused by a technical fault in developing or printing and that "they don't look like anything."

Junction City is about 100 miles south of Wichita, Kan., where trackers several unidentified objects flying about 45 miles an hour.

The northernmost sighting early yesterday came at Blaine, Minn., and Friday, Minn., two officers seeing the area reported seven or eight objects.

One report said the objects appeared to be spotted green on both sides with a bright red light on top.

The Air Force said a variety of stars and planets are probably responsible for the rash of reported UFO sightings.

"Initial study of reports received would indicate the observations were astrological in nature," the Air Force said.

The objects hovered and quickly darted about.

SO FAR UNIDENTIFIED

Flying Objects Spur
Rain of Phone Calls

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., Aug. 2 (AP)—Authorities in portions of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas were deluged last night and early today by reports of unidentified flying objects.

The Sedgwick county sheriff's office at Wichita, Kan., said the weather bureau tracked several objects at altitudes of 6,000 to 9,000 feet.

THE Oklahoma Highway patrol was tracking the unidentified flying objects on its radar screen at one time, maintaining their altitude at about 23,000 feet.

A Tinker spokesman refused to confirm or deny the radar observations.

"The reported sightings this evening will be investigated by Air Force personnel," said Information Officer Lt. John Walmsley.

The Oklahoma Highway patrol said police officers in three different patrol cars reported watching the objects fly in a diamond-shaped formation for about 30 minutes in the Shawnee area. The patrol said the officers described the objects as changing in color from red to white to blue-green.

A DISPATCHER for the Sedgwick county Kansas sheriff's office said "I was a dispatcher last night and so did other observers at the weather bureau and the Air Force base McConnell."

Descriptions phoned in to police and other authorities included:

"They were red and exploded in the clear sky."

Deputy Sheriff Dan Carter of Canyon, Tex., said he "thought at first a plane had exploded in the air."

SCIENTIST REFUTES AIR FORCE CLAIM THAT UFOs ARE STARS! Unidentified objects which were picked up on radar on August 2nd at the Wichita, Kansas, weather bureau, as well as elsewhere throughout the mid-west and west, were said by the Air Force to be the planet Jupiter or assorted stars. Robert Risser, Director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation planetarium in Oklahoma City (where numerous sightings were also made), said that local residents certainly did not see Jupiter or any of the stars which the Air Force listed in their explanatory report. Said Risser: "This (statement by the Air Force) is as far from the truth as you can get. Somebody has made a mistake. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year."

The sightings in question came in during the early days of August from Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. In addition to numerous radar sightings, there were dozens of reports by private citizens as well as police. But the Air Force stated, after a very superficial investigation, that the sightings were probably of the planet Jupiter or the stars Rigel, Capella, Betelgeuse, or Aldebaran.

Radar Tracks
Zipping Objects
Near Air Base

OKLAHOMA - Air Force radar tracked four unidentified flying objects at high altitude in a 30-mile radius of the Altus Air Force Base Sunday night, authoritative sources reported today.

At least eight Air Force men, officers and enlisted, were watching the two hours of radar activity after the first objects were spotted just before sundown.

The sightings followed a report by a UFO (United Flying Objects) patrol of two emissaries of the 1607 Civil Air Patrol unit who were watching.

Tracked on two radar screens, the objects darted about in a pattern that defied conventional explanation. The objects were tracked about 29 miles southeast of Altus, and at times moved about 1,000 miles an hour.

Highway Patrol said a security officer at Altus Air Force Base was called up from one to four times during the evening about the sightings.

The objects were described as an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet and moving at tremendous speeds.

A base spokesman later said he could not confirm or deny the objects. He said only that Air Force records would be studied.

sions across the nation's midlands and southwest again last night reported seeing mysterious flashing, winking and spark-ling phenomena that sped and sometimes zigzagged across the skies.

The Air Force contends most of the sightings were prob-ably just stars or planets.

Nolen E. Halsey, former director of the Federal Aviation Agency, said the real of reports may signal a new "American mythology."

REPORTS OF SUCH objects seem to reach their peak in August and September. It may be that the long, hot sum-mer expedites the imagination, he said in Los Angeles.

Most of the objects people saw were described as Red or yellow, and speeding across the sky from southwest to northeast at very high altitudes.

It was the fourth consecutive day of UFO sightings, which have harried some police departments so much they have referred all inquiries to Air Force bases.

A LOT OF PEOPLE took issue with the Air Force's claim they were stars or planets.

A 25-year-old Sioux City, la., high school English teacher said he saw a flashing object and that "anyone who would say this is a star would be out of their mind."

The teacher, who would not give his name, said he spotted the phenomenon when he and his wife drove out in their car to look for flying saucers.

SOMETHING ZIPPED overhead that was bright, yellowish and disc-shaped, shortly. It was replaced, he said, with a red light surrounded by three white lights. The red light was the brightest, he said.

He said he got out of the car and turned off the ignition to try to hear an airplane engine.

"There weren't any," he said.

Several other persons saw the same thing, he said.

AN AIR FORCE weather observer in Oklahoma City has repeatedly seen unusual objects in the skies, and said they are "too mirage."

bottom, and it was not a true sphere, the observer said.

"There were no rings around it and the first were part of the main body."

Two newsmen got pictures of the UFO's.

A photographer for the Junction City (Kan.) Union said he took a picture which showed eight black dots in the sky. He said he saw no dots when he photographed a skydiver parachute but when he developed it, the dots showed up on the negative.

SHELBY CRAIN, who lives near Harrison in northern Arkansas' Ozark mountains, saw something that "moved back and forth from northwest to southeast." It was joined by another thing that was dark red and they moved together, seeming to get higher and higher until they disappeared."

Crain, who saw the objects with his wife and 15-year-old son, said he called several neighbors to look.

A Harrison radio station said it got numerous reports of UFO's about the time the Crain reported them.

AN OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY patrolman said he believed he saw a UFO near Erick in extreme western Oklahoma. Similar sightings were reported at Lawton and Tulsa.

Several persons reported a series of flashing objects over the Denver area which was 2,500 to 3,000 feet high. It hovered up and down, then finally disappeared over the mountains, they said.

A green object sped along at an estimated 200 feet north of Albuquerque, N.M., but about four seconds then suddenly, an observer reported.

REPORT ON VISUAL SIGHTING OF
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
(Compiled August 3, 1965)

On Monday night August 2, 1965 between approximately 10:10 and 10:25 P.M. my wife, [redacted], and I visually observed an object in flight over the northern part of Austin. Following is a description of the object observed and the path flown:

The object was first observed in the northern sky at approximately 10:10 P.M. at an angle of approximately 15° from horizontal. It, to the naked eye, appeared as a bright star moving slowly from west to east. The object was then observed through 12 power binoculars. It was then ascertained that there were several individual white lights, the number of which is unknown but is felt to be four or five. The object appeared (on basis of the lights) as a large aircraft. Its speed, however, was quite slow (estimated around 50 mph) and the lights varied from time to time in intensity. To the naked eye, the intensity ranged from the brightest star (or possibly brighter) to almost fade-out.

The object continued eastward across the northern sky (at what appeared to be a constant altitude) for about five minutes. It then appeared to be motionless for less than one minute. At this point the object had traveled through an arc of approximately 70° from our vantage point. The object then appeared to have risen vertically for a few (less than 10) seconds. After approximately two minutes, we realized that it was moving almost directly toward us, e.g. in a westerly direction.


- page 274 -

The orientation of the lights as it came nearer changed from a line to two rows, to an outline of a flat elipse, to an elipse (minor diameter almost equal major diameter) as it passed over head (at about 75°) then to a flat elipse, two lines, and a single light source as it continued westerly. Absolutely no sound was heard in connection with the object as it passed overhead.

The lights of the object as it passed overhead appeared as in Figure 1. The central light appeared as a circular "glow". This glow varied in intensity from dim gradually to bright (felt to be a little brighter than the glow of a watch dial) back to dim but was not changing periodically. The outside lights were dim as it passed overhead, about the intensity of normal light bulbs at a far distance.

If the object were about the size of a large transport a/c, I would estimate the altitude as below 5000 feet.

Following are firm observations by myself and Margaret.

glow in center.

5. Large center light described
as a "glow" but much brighter
than pinpoint lights.

6. Object had two reddish
lights.

6. No opinion.

7. Object had constant inten-
sity pinpoint lights when
observed 1 minute from
overhead.

7. Object lights seemed to
"flicker".

8. Object appeared as a line
of white lights as it
disappeared in distance.

reddish hue.

9. Object made absolutely no
detectable sound as it

10. Object covered entire view
of binoculars in the near
vicinity of overhead.

11. To naked eye lights varied

11. Lights "flickered".

12. Nobody was seen; only
lights, with and without
binoculars.

13. Object was observed con-
tinuously from initial
sighting to disappearing
to the west.

14. Orientation of lights ap-
peared as shown in sketch.
In additional elliptical
pattern of lights changed
as described above.

Following are opinions concerning the object, not to be considered as firm observations:

Myself

1. Exact number of individual
lights unknown, but felt
to be as sketched.

2. Object appeared to have
stopped, but may have been
traveling directly away
from us.

3. Object was observed for
about 15 minutes.

13. Same

14. Same

1. No opinion.

2. Same

3. Object was observed for 10
plus minutes.

In Figure 2 times and locations are approximate:

1. 10:10 P.M. Initial sighting - appeared as a bright light to
naked eye.

2. 10:12 P.M. observed through binoculars - several pinpoint lights
were seen. Looked like a slow moving aircraft.


- page 277 -

3. 10:13 P.M. same as (2).

4. 10:14 P.M. same as (3).

5. 10:15 P.M. lights appeared motionless for about 30 seconds, followed by what appeared to be a vertical rise in altitude for a few (approximately 5) seconds.

6. 10:16 P.M. definitely ascertained that the object was approaching us. It appeared as a line of lights to the naked eye.

7. 10:16 P.M. object appeared as a line of lights.

8, 9, 10. 10:17 P.M. at 8, the lights appeared as two lines; at 9 as a very flat ellipse; at 10 as an ellipse of major diameter to minor diameter as approximately 3:1. Also at 10, first indication of a large glow circumscribed by the lights was noted.

11, 12, 13. 10:18 P.M. lights appeared as an ellipse with major diameter to minor diameter as approximately 3:2. A large "glow" was definitely discernible and its brightness was greater than the circumscribing pinpoint lights.

14, 15, 16, 17. 10:19, 20, 21 P.M. lights changed from ellipse to two lines and then to single light source to naked eye. At 14 the large center light was not apparent. At 17 the light disappeared from view.

The day following the sighting, I tried to correlate what we had seen with the Weather Bureau and Bergstrom AFB. Neither source had tracked the object with radar, or had recorded sightings from Austin citizens.

Following is listed information which may be in some way connected with the object:

1. Weather Bureau reported no knowledge of weather balloons in the area at this time.

2. Winds at 9000 feet were from the northwest at 1.3 to 8 knots during the evening of the 2nd.

3. Winds at 5000 feet were from the southeast at almost negligible velocity.

4. [Name redacted], a member of a satellite observing team observed an unidentified second magnitude object at 11:35 P.M. traveling north (at unknown speed and altitude) and disappeared after 27 seconds.

5. Austin American Newspaper reported sightings from citizens living approximately 3/4 mile southwest of my residence. They reported sightings of an object "rectangular in shape with colored flickering lights" at approximately 9:30 P.M.

Following was compiled on September 17, 1965:

The only sighting that I have been able to correlate with our sighting was a report from a Meteorology student (Jesse Charba). He related a description of the sighting to me without any prior knowledge of my having observed an object of unusual nature. Before informing him of what I had seen, I questioned him in detail about what he had observed. Although vague, his description of the object was no doubt relates to the same thing we had seen. He observed the object from a vantage point about 3 miles south southwest from where we were and about 45 minutes after we had seen it disappear to the west. It was confirmed that his sighting was during the evening of August 2, at approximately 11:00 P.M.


- page 280 -

Following is a description of what he observed as he related it to me:

At approximately 11:00 P.M. he sighted a large reddish light at about 25 degrees from horizontal at almost due north. The object was traveling eastward at a very slow speed and what appeared to be a low altitude. The large light did not flicker but changed in intensity from a pale glow to as bright as the brightest star, pulsating in intensity. The object continued eastward for a short but unknown period of time. When it was at approximately 150 from horizontal, it stopped moving, and remained motionless for more than a minute. It then began moving westward and passed over the observer at approximately 70° from horizontal. At no time were individual pinpoint lights observed, only a large reddish light which was circular in shape. There appeared to be no periodic pulsation of light intensity, but there was a definite change in brightness going slowly from dim to bright and back again. The size of the light was compared as slightly smaller in size than the moon. There was absolutely no sound connected with the object. The object continued westward and disappeared from sight, not from view.

EDITOR'S NOTE—Maj. Hec
tor Quintanilla Jr., is a physicist
who spends his time staring into
the skies—poking over
weather maps, tracing nature's
check out reports of flying things
found out about UFOs for the
Air Force is our following story.

By M. L. GOLDBERG

DAYTON, Ohio (AP) — The
Air Force doesn't believe in
flying saucers.

That's not just a snap conclu-
sion, but is based on the inves-
tigation of more than 9,000 re-
ported unidentified flying ob-
jects compiled by the Air Force's
Air Force's—and in fact the
world's—agency for scientific
analysis of aerial pheno-

There is nothing in indica-
tions that any of these phenomena
are extraterrestrial in nature,
said Maj. Hector Quintanilla Jr., a serious, 42-year-old physi-
cist in charge of the project for
examining UFO reports. More-
over, sightings in at least eight
states—including Louisiana, Ok-
lahoma and Kansas—earlier this
month, Quintanilla claims, were
seeing UFOs actually were look-
ing at planets and stars, or four
prominent stars. He said
atmospheric conditions "gave
many persons the impression"
made them appear "close to-
gether and in formation."

The major explained that Air
Force reports that Tinker
City, Air Force Base at Oklahoma
City, and McConnell Air Force
Base at Wichita, Kans., spotted
UFOs on radar were "not cor-
roborated by visual sightings."

Quintanilla replied, "They
could not signed something that
was not there." He said the peo-
ple put two and two together.

"The radar sighting at Tinker
was on the opposite side of the
spectrum a the reported UFO
sightings."

Fine, but what was it radar
that fixed up? "A building, well
(an atmospheric inversion
brought on by the conditions
and varying temperatures) caus-
atures) caused the radar beams
to bounce off and fix on some-
thing not moving.

The major explained that in-
versions are responsible for 40
to 50 sightings involving radar
beam. If the reported radar
sightings are a training facility
moving away from the radar
beam, it could, if given a
chance, be identified as a high-flying unidentified object.

The first thing I do when I
get a report is a large, round
table in my office with a map of
the United States and surround-
ing areas of the universe sur-
rounding the position of any planet
or star that might be visible at
that time.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

1 - High flying balloons:
"There is much balloon activity, private. Some of them get away and are hard to trace, but we can usually solve them by finding out who put up a wire and the direction the wind was blowing."

2 - High flying aircraft, illuminated after the sun had set on the ground:

3 - Nightly reflections in the atmosphere of distant light sources on the ground.

Meteorites, fireworks, flares, chaff and pieces of satellites, "Satellite decay," etc.

These are pieces of junk from space, "they pass into the atmosphere and burn up when they last several minutes. We have often found pieces of these very shortly after it as from earth satellites. These look much slower."

4 - Planets, Venus and Jupiter, or other astronomical bodies.

5 - Searchlights illuminating old cloud layers and the like.

6 - Jet exhausts, contrails, condensation trails.

7 - Hoaxes or mirages, "So far this year, there has been only one reported hoax."

Quintanilla notes: 663 unsolved UFO sighting cases "nearly half" of them in the past of 1952. But he adds "None has ever given any indication of being a threat to our national security, of being beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge, or as being extraterrestrial."

Despite this approach to UFO, what does he think of the possible existence of an advanced life in outer space?

1. We appreciate Mr. _______ interest on the subject of unidentified flying objects. The attached brochure outlines the status of this project. Its. Ruppelt was the project officer in 1952 and 1953.
His book was written as a civilian after his discharge from the Service, and the opinions stated represent those of the author and do not reflect the opinion of the United States Air Force. Lt. Ruppelt
The present policy is to submit photographs submitted to the Air Force himself.
more familiar with the subject photographic evidence to specialists.
Lt. Ruppelt have been re-evaluated and an evaluation consistent with photographic evidence has been made. An example of this re-evaluation is the Selan, Massachusetts Coast Guard photographs of 16 July 52.
The initial evaluation was that of a hoax, since the "lights" did not reflect consistent with an internal light source or the windows.

2. Mr. _______ analysis of the Wiltshire photos of 20 August 1965 is indeed interesting. His analysis is in accord with that used by present photo analysts. He has been evaluated pictures submitted to the Air Force. This analysis has been forwarded to the photographic section as an item of interest to them.

Office of Information
Secretary of the Air Force

WASHINGTON DC. 20330

Gentlemen:

Mr. B. J. Slattery of the NASA of Huntsville (AL) told me by direction of Dr. W. von Braun, that the Air Force is "conducting investigations on UFO's" and that published results can be obtained from your office.

1) On attached note P-234 I have analysed the recent UFO-sighting at Warminster (Dorset/England) by method I was not 100% reliable, having to use certain assumptions, I claim that it has a high degree of reliability. As the most reliable assumptions can be named: 1. the UFO diameter (S 2 or no note) and still better the overall height: 8 feet (§3 of my note) A = 166 feet is certainly an unacceptable figure.

2) My method can be further developed and enlarged. I do not know how far the Air Force investigating office has progressed since Lts. Ruppelt did not give a single photo in his book. (1956). Lt. Ruppelt did not give a single photo in his book and a sharp analysis of the evidence, presented to him. The question whether UFO's are real or not, cannot be decided by majority-vote but only by a very thorough analysis of evidence produced, especially of UFO-photos.

3) Please forward by letter and the print P-234 to the Air Force investigating office.

4) Please let me know whether you are publishing weekly or monthly information bulletin on UFO-analysis. Did you publish one on the Warminster case? If so, please send.

5) Please send me a list (with prices) of current publications from the Air Force. I doubt, whether an UFO are real. One must be openminded, until the last little evidence has been discussed. Various civilian UFO-research groups must be taught to be REALISTIC and RATIONAL. Otherwise their claims can not be taken seriously. My note is a hint, what should be done with every photo of an UFO presented.

7) I have more critical ideas on that UFO-subject. Suggest, that an openminded member of the Airforce investigating team gets in touch with me.

Encl.: 1 P-234.

Sincerely yours,
Mech. Eng. ret. American citizen.

Department of the Air Force

Washington D.C.

Gentlemen:

I presume that the Air Force still maintains an office, which is analyzing flying saucers. I do not know the present situation, only know the activities which H. G. B. himself described in his book of 1956, "Report on unidentified flying objects".

An important phase of this work is to compile and reject photos of UFO's.

I was surprised along that lack of these known long, oval strategy methods can be used, as an example I am sending you, and it is a recent Washington-made method can be further explored or developed.

Yours truly,
[Signature and additional redacted section at bottom of page]

ANALYSIS OF AN UFO-PHOTO.

I) The photo was taken by Gordon Faulkner on August 29, 65. in Warminster (Wiltshire) and published (about 10 times enlarged) in the DAILY MIRROR of Sept. 10, 65.

II) ADDITIONAL DATA:
From the DAILY MIRROR (DM):
a) The UFO flew fast and low over the South of the town.
b) It made no noise.
c) The camera was a Halina, 35 mm.
d) It was focused on infinity.
e) The shutter speed was 1/50 sec.

From Oct. 65. (GP) in his letter to me:
f) The film was black-white. Speed rating: ASA-125.
g) The photo was taken after sunset at 8:20 pm against a clear sky.
h) The shutter speed was "perhaps: 1/25 sec."
i) The estimated distance of the UFO from the camera was: 1/4 to 1/2 mile.
j) The estimated diameter of the UFO-disk was 30 to 35 feet.
k) UFO spotted it was "probably quicker than a jet.
l) The distance from film to center of lens on my camera - a = 2-1/8" = 54 mm.

III) DEMENSIONS:
Diameter of the UFO disk: D = full size. D' = on DM-picture. D" = on GP-film. 
Overall height of UFO: H = on full size. H' = on DM-picture. H" = on GP-film.

IV) ANALYSIS.
a) From similar triangles follows: A:D = a:D".
Ergo: A = (D x a) : D" and D = (A x D")a.
b) We check now, whether the film data check with reasonable assumptions.
1) We assume A = 3/8 mile and solve for D. 3/8 mile = 604,000 mm. 
D = (604,000 x 6.2) : 54 = 69,300 mm = 226 feet. WAY TO LARGE !!

2) We assume D = 32.5 feet = 11,650 mm and solve for A.
A = (11,650 x 3/4) : 6.2 = 1,401 mm = 333 feet. TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT! The shockwave of the passing UFO would have knocked GP off his feet!

3) We assume H = 8 feet = 2,440 mm and solve for A.
A = (2,440 x 54) : 6.2 = 20,500 mm = 1/16 feet. THIS IS WORSE THAN THE 333 FT.

4) We assume the UFO speed = speed of sound = 331 m/sec = 710 miles/hour which would be considerably less than the speed of a jet (about 1,200 miles/hour). If the UFO flew at "high angle to the camera", the blur-out in flight direction would have been for 1/37 sec. shutter speed equal to 331/37 = 8.9 m = 29 ft. If flying at a smaller angle to the camera-axis it would be less. Anyway the blur-out on the DM-picture, which at maximum would have to be: (52 x 29.2) = 1,520 mm is actually only (1) is actually "nil" WHICH IS PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF IT WAS NOT MOVING AT ALL !! Suppose it was a model of 1 ft diameter, then a would have to be 2,660 mm = 8.7 feet, quite a reasonable figure !

V) OUTLOOK.
UFO-researchers show a great lack of thoroughness in analyzing their data. My analysis of the Warminster UFO-photo shows, what has to be done. There are more methods for a thorough analysis. Details will be explained on request.

21 August, 1965
Bunkie, La.

Goes Step-Like

"I didn't move straight up but looked like R was going up slant." (He said it moved diagonally and then vertically again, over and over.)

It was very luminous. It looked to be about two and a half miles up.

When he finally got his wife to the window, it was disappearing upward.

At the same morning, his wife and some friends about it.

"Yes, they laughed and ribbed me at first. But since then they've read something about these things, and they don't laugh as much anymore."

Case No. 3

Bobby Puckett, 14, of Mount Road, has been reading about space and flying saucers for some time. On many a night he has spent hours gazing skyward.

Bobby kept telling his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Abernathy, and his sister about what he saw. They laughed at him until...

Last Tuesday night Bobby saw something and after checking with his sister, who was sitting in the middle of the road, saw a big star.

"Abnormally and calling their star 'weirdest'," he said.

Mrs. Abernathy said the activity around the big star that was odd at first had been followed by other strange things.

For the next two hours, Mrs. Abernathy said, she, her six children and two neighbors watched what they thought was a star.

Mrs. Abernathy said the activity around the big star that was odd at first had been followed by other strange things.

It wasn't exactly round, more of a...

Dear Sirs:

While on vacation in Valentine, Nebraska, I saw and photographed some UFO's that were seen in the midwest. My data is for the nights of the second and third of August.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society for several years, and have been observing for even longer and have never seen anything like the objects in question. My objective is to find out exactly what I did see.

If you are willing to examine my report and photos, please notify me, and the data will be forthcoming.

Dear Mr. Hall:

Enclosed is my report on the Unidentified Objects.
Unfortunately, I am not able at this time, to present the photos, because I originally had only three sets made. However, as soon as school gets under way their classes are using their labs, and the photographer will have one of my friends make some copies and I will have one of them.

I am quite aware that you are not one of the groups that pose as experts on the UFOs. I have discovered, in my investigation of these objects, that many of the groups contacted are most unscientific, assuming, almost before having seen the data, that the objects are extraterrestrial in nature. It is from your observatory and others around the country, from the non-experts that I am hoping to get a scientific analysis of my sightings.

Dear Mr. Hall:

I am not able to release the photographs because I obtained them under the condition of anonymity from a source in "Alameda, California." I have one of the photographs and I will send them.

The report you mention sounds very interesting. Many U.F.O.s have been reported and many of them identified. While these sound very interesting, no one at Griffith Observatory has been able of these objects and we cannot, at this time, make a positive identification. We will be willing to examine your photographs and report but doubt that we can help you.

Dear Mr. Hall:

In my letter of Sept. 7, I said that the photos that accompany my report on unidentified objects or phenomena would be forthcoming. They are enclosed.

By photographic analysis, it was determined that photos A and A1 in the report were two different printings of the same negative, so to save some, only the best copy negative was printed.

I am most interested in your opinion of the nature of the phenomena that I observed.

Gentlemen:

I am sending you a report, correspondence and two pictures sent to Griffith Observatory for evaluation. We are not able to identify the objects seen on August second and third and hope that you may be able to help us. Most of these reports on U.S.F.'s we handle here but this one has us puzzled. When there is a U.F.O. reported in this area, we usually have enough reports to identify it, but this one is out of the area of Southern California.

We request that you send the material and photographs back to us so that we can return them with your report to the witness. We would appreciate a report from you on the best possible identification of these objects.

Sincerely,
Leon Hall

Burning light

The South Wales Evening Post of 4 September 3 carried a letter from Mrs. V. Fawcett of Swansea, telling how her daughter was standing at the window of her Townhill, Morriston home at 11:20 p.m. on August 25 when she saw a bright object approaching in the sky. The object was illuminated by the glare, which seemed also to burn into her skin and because very frightened. Her husband was at work, and she was still quite shocked when he came home more next morning.

A neighbour recalled that for days she had been frightened at the same time, and for ten minutes before she was utterly to put out.

Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of unidentified objects or phenomena, I believe that you have a copy of my report and photos. Could not all be reported on your Form 164, as there were many of them on two nights, as you will learn from my report.

Also, I believe that Form 164 might confuse things, as many of the other forms, similar to it, as I have attempted to fill out have, in my report, which I took several weeks to prepare, I have presented the total story and the inter-relations between objects, in the most orderly and scientific fashion possible, having had the report commended by several UFO investigation groups, among them, NICAP.

As for the negatives, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared between Lincoln and Valentine, Nebr.

If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have not explained in my report here, I will be quite willing to talk with your people.

Very truly yours,

March 7, 1966

[Recipient's address is redacted]

Dear Miss Hatcher:

Major Quintanilla has forwarded to me your sightings of August 2 and 3, 1965; including a copy of his letter to you of February 24, 1966. I want to compliment you on the form and detail of your report. You have been most helpful.

I was going to put in a call to you or to Dr. [redacted], but in the meantime the other day I had a brief conversation with Dr. [redacted] who wired me, but not few days ago. But in the event that I would like to have some points clarified, I can make myself understood the phone with some effort, and so I ask your indulgence in advance should I call.

The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that came in to the Air Force of sightings made on the nights of July 31 through August 3, 1965. I am hoping that your reports, plus a personal interview or at best a few phone calls, will help us great may solve some together. It is entirely possible that something of considerable scientific value may come out of this investigation. I hope some way can be worked out to give this particular problem my personal attention, as it interests me greatly.

I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained angular rates and altitudes, although I wish you had made a time-sequence plot of altitudes and azimuths, and close passages to stars. Perhaps you can still do this from memory. Are you going to visit in Valentine, Nebraska again this summer? If so, it might be interesting to The annot the origin with the sky setting the same. What I ask a few questions as a starter?

I assume that objects A, B1 and C1 were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 23, and that only object D was visible on the night of August 3-4. Is this correct?


- page 346 -

Here is the text from the document:

-2-

The antics of sunset Cl are most interesting. When C
appeared from behind the trees, what was its angular rate? About that of
shot? Faster? The disappearance, you say, took place in a matter of
seconds, but what about the travel of Cl to the rendezvous point?

I wish you would expand on the astronomical seeing conditions — and the transparency. Were there any clouds at all? Any haze?
What was the limiting visual magnitude of stars visible to the unaided
eye? Was there any noticeable twinkle in the stars in the immediate
vicinity of the objects Cl and Gl? Did the lights you saw themselves
twinkle in a similar manner? And how were you pointing at the time?
Could I have details of the lights? What did they look like in shape?

By the way, I did not receive copies of the photographs. Were there any? If so, why did it not, was this the reason?

[Several lines in the middle of the page are partially illegible]

If I can't get to improve quickly, and if I can't
in the Los Angeles area to talk with you, I would like to get my
task at Harvard and I think she would be willing to do this favor for me.
But we shall see. Let's see what changes are coming and whether we can wrap up with a physical theory for your experience and apparently that of many
other people in the area of early August.

Are the above questions clear? Would you be kind enough to elaborate. Some
I do hope that answers will be direct of answering questions. Many
might be yes or no, others again I have forewarned you in question. The
slight of questions from this daily occurrence and I hope you have not been
bothered too much. Thank you again.

Sincerely yours,

However, the majority of the text is too blurry and dark to read with certainty.

Dear Sirs:

While on vacation in Valentine, Nebraska, I saw and photographed some of the UFO's that were seen in the midwest. My data is for the nights of the second and third of August.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society for several years, and have been observing for even longer, and have never seen anything like the objects in question. My objective is to find out exactly what I did see.

If you are willing to examine my report and photos, please notify me, and the data will be forthcoming.

Dear Mr. Hall:

Enclosed is my report on the Unidentified Objects. Unfortunately, I am not able at this time, to sent the photos, because I originally had only five sets made. However, as soon as school gets under way their labs, and the photography classes are using their labs, I will have one of my friends make some copies and I will send them.

I am quite aware that you are not one of the groups that pose as experts on the UFO's. I have discovered, in my investigation of these objects, that many of the groups that I have contacted are most unscientific, assuming, almost before having seen the data, that the objects are extraterrestrial in nature. It is from your observatory and others around the country, from the 'non-experts' that I am hoping to get a scientific analysis of my sightings.

Truly yours,

Disc over Stonehenge

Mr. and Mrs. P. Wilcher of Southend-on-Sea were driving near Stonehenge when, according to the Evening Post of August 26, Mrs. Wilcher saw "four silver objects coming over a hill". At first she thought the sun was very catching the wing of an aeroplane but there was no sound in the air above. She drew her husband's attention to the strange sight.

Mr. Wilcher stopped the car, got out and looked up. "As far I could see only two of three queer things," he said later. "Then a third covered and a fourth joined the trio shortly after. They were moving circular."

Date of sighting: August 25

Dear Mr. Hall:

Your recent report on the incident, I am not able it, because I cannot definitely state, however, as some photographs will help me.

Clearly Griffith Observers, using their lens, will have one of the Drawings. We will send them.

The report you mention sounds very interesting. Many U.F.O.'s have been reported and most of them unidentified. While these sound very interesting no one, at Griffith Observatory, has been any of these objects and we cannot, pose as experts in their identification. We will be willing to examine your photographs and report but doubt that we can help you.

Gentlemen:

I am sending you a report, correspondence and two pictures sent to Griffith Observatory for evaluation. We are not able to identify the objects seen on August second and third and hope that you may be able to help us. Most of these reports on U.S.A.F.'s we handle here but this one has us puzzled. When there is a U.F.O. reported in this area, we usually have enough reports to identify it, but this one is out of the area of Southern California.

We request that you send the material and photographs back to us so that we can return them with your report to Juli Anna Hatcher. We would appreciate a report for her as soon as possible identifying these objects.

Sincerely,
Leon Hall

Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of unidentified objects or phenomena, I believe that you have a copy of my report and photos. Due to the nature of these objects or phenomena, they could not all be reported on Form 164, as there were many of them on two nights, as you will learn from my report.

Also, I believe that Form 164 might confuse things, as many of the other forms, similar to it, that I have attempted to fill out have been rejected. Several weeks to prepare, I have presented the total story and the inter-relationships between objects. In the most orderly and scientific fashion possible, having had the report commented by several UFO investigation groups, among them, NICAP.

As for the negatives, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared between Lincoln and Valentine, Nebr.

If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have not explained either in my report or here, I will be quite willing to talk with your people.

Very truly yours,
[Signature is blacked out]

Rio de Janeiro
27 August 1965

And, a Reuters dispatch from Rio de Janeiro, dated August 27th, quotes an article in a newspaper called "Brail Herald," written by a journalist of 20 years experience, who claims to have personally met two occupants of a flying saucer. The newsman, named Gabriel Rubens Mellvig, says the same UFO the size of a small car land in a rice field. He communicated with the two-man crew telepathically, he claims. They informed him that they come from another solar system, and they seemed very intelligent. No further details are given in the Reuters story.

March 7, 1966

[Redacted address in California 91202]

Major Quintanilla has forwarded to me some correspondence relative to your sightings of August 2 and 3, 1965; including a copy of his letter to you of February 26, 1966. I want to compliment you on the form and detailed your report.

I was going to put in a call to you or to Dr. Dunlap, but in New Mexico the other day I had a bad fall and broke my jaw. So I am writing you, but not over the phone. But in the same that I would like to have some points cleared up, I can make myself understood on the phone with some effort, and so I ask your indulgence in advance should I call.

The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that came in to the Air Force of sightings made on the nights of July 31 through August 3, 1965. I am hoping that your report, plus a personal interview or at best a few phone calls, will help us this a great many loose ends together. It is extremely possible that something of considerable scientific value may come out of this investigation. I therefore earnestly solicit your cooperation. I imagine you and your friends are as anxious as I am to solve this mystery. I can assure you that I will give this particular problem my personal attention, as it interests me greatly.

I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained angular rates and altitudes, although I wish you had made a time-sequence plot of altitudes and azimuth, and close passages to stars. Perhaps you can still do this from memory. Are you going to visit in Valentine, Nebraska again this summer? If so, it might be interesting to "re-enact the crime" with the sky setting the same. Might I ask a few questions as a starter?

I assume that objects A, B, and C1 were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 2-3, and that only object D was visible on the night of August 3-4. Is this correct?


- page 365 -

Here is the text from the document:

-2-

The antics of subset Cl are most interesting. When Cl heard from behind the tree, what was its angular rate? About that of a shot? Fast? The disappearance, you say, took place in a matter of seconds, but what about the travel of Cl and Cl1 to their rendezvous point?

I wish you would expand on the astronomical seeing conditions — and the transparency. Were there any clues at all? Any haze? What was the limiting visual magnitude of stars visible to the unaided eye? Was there any noticeable twilight? Can you describe the immediate vicinity of the objects Cl and Cl1? Did the lights you saw themselves twinkle in a small area near the extreme point? What was the color of the lights? And why were you looking at the extreme point? What messages of the photographs? Have these returned to you, and if not, who has them now?

If I could get to Los Angeles soon to investigate, I could ask one of my friends in the Los Angeles area to take with perhaps some of the ground details or else. Alan Sandage or perhaps he is directly busy right now, but Mrs. Sandage used to be my lab assistant. But we shall see. Let's see how things develop and whether we can come up with a physical theory. You were apparently that apparently that of many other people in the midwest on those evenings of early August.

I am taking a few of my questions available for answering a few of my questions. Well, you be frank enough to admit I do hope that you will not become tired of answering questions. Many principles in other cases I have investigated have complained of the onslaught of questions from the public. I hope you have not been bothered too much. Thank you again.

With the exception of the motion of the three objects, it appears that some sort of mirage was the most likely cause. The negatives of the photos were not available therefore, no photo analysis could be made.
