It could be noted that while the image does not contain a photograph, the text states "Photos will be forthcoming", suggesting that photographs may be provided in a later document.

The text in the document is as follows:

It should be noted that while these, during the course of several earlier communications, reports of sightings and disappearances, now or recent in occurrence, have appeared to involve objects or phenomena which cannot readily be accounted for by conventional explanations, corroborating evidence or proofs, of the same, have not been sufficiently conclusive to warrant the formal reporting on these occurrences through channels. It is my opinion that this report, as is, does not lend itself to definitive conclusions or judgements on the nature of the incident or its implications. However, as you will note, the photographs which were to accompany this report have not yet been received. It is possible that these, when obtained, may provide additional information or clarification which could alter the initial assessment of this incident.

Photos will be forthcoming.

Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of reported objects or phenomena, I believe that you have a copy of my report and photos. Due to the nature of the phenomena involved, they could not be photographed any clearer than they were on two nights. As you will learn from my report, these objects seemed to avoid the camera when I attempted to fill out have it. In my reports, which took several hours to complete, I have described the objects in the most orderly and scientific fashion possible, having had the opportunity to observe them well on at least two occasions for a number of hours.

As the relatives, I can not submit the originals for the paranormal and Valentine, Sheriff-If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have observed, either in my report or here, I will be quite willing to talk with your people.

Very truly yours,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter discussing observations of unusual celestial phenomena, possibly related to a UFO sighting.

The antices of subsat C. are most interesting. When C appeared from behind some saucer?, about three or more? easter?. The disappearances, you say, took place in a matter of seconds. This suggests a strange device of some kind. Do their radivous point?

I wish you would expand on the astronomical seeing conditions - and the thing? diminishing and enlarging as before and stopping the eyes. What was this that had no visible eye? Wasn't this to the extreme twinkling to the stars in the immediate vicinity? How does this tie in with CI and the lights moving at tremendous speed? What did they look like? Were these only focal images of the lights? What did they look like in focus?

By the way, I did not receive any copies of the photographs. Were these returned to you, and if not, who has them now?

And we object to: When the airplane came by, how many seconds did light remain off?

If it continues to warrant deeper investigation, I could say: one of my friends in the Los Angeles area may be able to assist you. Perhaps his investigation could be helpful.

He is extremely busy right now, but Mrs. Hynek would be delighted to discuss the facts you gathered with him. She would be glad to assist in any way she could.

I have a special theory for your experience and apparent that of many others. Are the other witnesses to your experience available for consultation?

Answering a few questions: I am just learning of your incident now I would be interested in any details which may supplement the information I now have. I understand in other cases I have investigated there have been complaints of the reluctance of witnesses to discuss their observations. I hope you will not find this to be the case.

Thank you again.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Director

Miss _____________
Glendale, California 91205

Dear Miss _____________,

Major Quintanilla has forwarded to me some correspondence relative to your report of August 5 and 6, 1965 including a copy of his letter to you of February 24, 1966. I want to compliment you on the form and detail of report. You put to shame some professional investigators.

I was going to put in a call to you or to Dr. and Mrs. _____________, but I am wired up now, but not for sound. I was in the event that I would wish to have some points cleared up, I find that your report was so full and complete that I see no need for any further call.

The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that came in to the Air Force on sightings made on the night of August 3-4, 1965. It appears that yours was one of the more complete and detailed ones. There is a growing suspicion that something of great many kinds and together. It is entirely possible that something of tremendous significance happened during those hours that night and we have only incomplete reports to indicate what may have occurred.

I am as anxious as I am to solve this mystery. I can assure you that I will give the particular problem my personal attention, as I am interested in it greatly.

I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained a very complete sequence plot of attitudes and azimuths, and close passages to stars. Perhaps you can still do this from memory. The data going to visit in Valentine Nebraska is still on my mind and I might ask a few questions as a further check.

I assume that objects A, B and C were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 3-4 and that only object B was visible on the night of August 3-4. Is this correct?

text:

In January 65-, Mr. Moore (pseudonym) was eating dinner with his wife near Bunkie, Louisiana. At approximately 7:00 p.m. they observed several red lights in the sky that were maneuvering at a high rate of speed. The lights were located somewhere over the east northeast horizon area.

The object(s) were observed for approximately 15-20 minutes and the observers were able to see the object(s) make several sudden turns and stops. The objects were also observed to change directions several times.

The temperature was approximately 65 degrees and the sky was clear. The observers could not hear any sound from the object(s). The object(s) appeared to be at a high altitude.

The observers stated they believe the object(s) were under intelligent control, but could not determine if the object(s) were craft or simply lights.

The observers reported this sighting to the local civil defense office upon returning home.

No Case, Information Only
Source: Saucer News, Vol 12, No. 4 
Date: 65

TRUCK DRIVER CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER IN KANSAS: One of the weirdest incidents of the current saucer-side film occurred about 25 miles south of Abilene, Kansas, shortly before 2 a.m. on the morning of August 4th. Don Tennyson, a truck driver from Bartlesville, Oklahoma, reported that he was driving south on Highway 15 when all of his lights suddenly went out. He then noticed an object passed just in front of the truck with a "sizzling or whirling" sound, going above the sound barrier, clearing his truck by about 10 feet. The mysterious object was only about 15 feet in diameter, orange in color, and was moving at a great rate of speed. It seemed to be about ten feet thick, with a deep, wide, four-foot-high hump or dome in the middle. This protrusion was completely unnerved by the experience, but he was not sure on this point.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system output:

The Civilian Saucer Intelligence organization believes the investigation into this case is one of the most detailed and thorough conducted since the inception of the flying saucer controversy. The data collected seems to indicate that the physical evidence is sufficient to warrant serious consideration.

At 5:15 AM the observer, Mrs. X, was awakened by a strange noise and glowing light outside her home. Upon looking out of the window she observed a large saucer-shaped object hovering about 20 feet over a field adjacent to her home. The object was approximately 40 feet in diameter and 12 to 15 feet thick at the center. It was illuminated from within and appeared to be changing colors, going from a brilliant white to a dazzling blue-green and then to an amber tone. There was no sound associated with the object.

Mrs. X continued to observe the object for approximately 15 minutes before it suddenly shot up at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. She immediately dressed and went outside to examine the field. There she found three distinct impressions in the soft earth, approximately 12 inches in diameter and spaced about 20 feet apart, forming an isosceles triangle. The center of each impression was slightly burned and had a greasy black substance on the edges.

Samples of the soil and vegetation from the area were collected and sent to the project laboratories for detailed analysis.

Text extracted from the document:

Please to consider that this is strictly confidential fact that many facts have been collected that indicate it is no longer tenable for official management to refuse to acknowledge the reality of UFOs and the continuing flow of highly reliable reports from competent and trained observers. Failure to consider this information is not only a disservice to the taxpayers who pay for the management of this program, but may also carry serious political risks. Dark diecast Delavan (unreadable name) material harbor and the retical has been in dark and unapplanable for some 2 weeks now. The vehicle again has taken a report that it has been sited (sic) about 5 miles west of Bunkie, Louisiana, on August 9, 1965. The vehicle was hovering about 50 feet above the ground and was observed for about 10 minutes before it made a rapid departure in a SW direction. The observer was an adult male, sober, reliable and reportedly has a good reputation in the community. There is no reason to doubt the veracity of his report. Please forward this information to proper authorities for immediate consideration.

UFO Report
This is a report of a call from the 4th of August 1965 case of Mrs. and Mr. witnesses. There was a mix-up here. 
One object they saw in the west seems most likely to have been Venus - it was stationary. A few nights later they saw Echo, but the primary sighting remains unexclined. Here or the witnesses, that is, Mr. and Mrs. 
is exactly a bright light, but I got most from Mrs. They generally agreed on the fact that they were facing northward one evening, shortly after dark, and shortly overhead they say a very bright light, very much brighter than any other star, which moved erratically, Went out, came back to the site, moved, stopped, grew brighter when it stopped, and kept this sort of thing up for about 15 minutes, spending its very slowly from nearly overhead to about "6 inches off the end of the moon". This establishes the fact that it made an appreciable arc across the sky, and hence rules out a twinkling star. It does not mile cut a balloon, I said below. The identity of the object remained the same because she said they watched it the whole time. She said it would move, then stop, turn brighter, then move again. It was the color of other stars, rather bluish white. 
Because a police officer came to their apartment saying that some young girl had reported it. The police officers apparently got there too late to see anything. However, they said that they had had reports from all over the city about the strange object. The case is sufficiently interesting to send the 164 Forms to them, and I am so doing - several of them, so Mrs. can get the neighbors to fill them out also.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter. The letter is dated November 30, 1965 and is addressed to "Mrs. _______, Omaha, Nebraska" from "J. Allen Hynek, Director". The letter discusses a sighting of an unidentified flying object and requests that the "jilled-out forms" be mailed back.

November 30, 1965

Mrs. _______
Omaha, Nebraska 

Dear Mrs. _______:

Following our phone conversation, I am sending you several copies of the Form 106s, one for you and the others for your neighbors. I hope they will cooperate and kindly fill these out.

Please refer only to the object sighted originally and not to the satellite or other things seen in the week or week and a half later.

The jilled-out forms should be mailed back to me.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

Based on the image, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The image shows a document titled "Request for Radar Information" from the United States Weather Bureau Station in Wichita, Kansas, dated September 3, 1955. The document requests information about specific radar returns that may represent unidentified flying objects.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from a UFO report or Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present in this image. 

Transcription of the handwritten text:

"Tellinogut and some of the population are convinced that a saucer landed at the town cemetery recently. The mayor has interviewed a number of the witnesses and according to his statements the object was elliptical in shape, about 50 feet in diameter, and hovered over the cemetery for several minutes. It then took off straight up at a terrific speed. The witnesses stated that the object was silent during the landing and take-off.  

Many of the inhabitants of Tellinogut are disturbed because of this incident, and some of them are even considering moving away from the area, fearing that the object might return. The mayor has contacted the nearest Air Force base to report the incident, but so far no official investigation has been made.

It is further reported that in the nearby town of St. Joseph, a similar object was sighted several weeks ago, also hovering over the local cemetery. The description of the object was almost identical to the one reported from Tellinogut.  

If other reports of this nature are received, it is recommended that a thorough and prompt investigation be made, in order to determine the true nature of these sightings."

Project Blue Book 1965-08-9371437-Bunkie-Louisiana.pdf57.txt

The handwritten text in the image is as follows:

My first sighting of a delighted wife and a wild red dog for some unspecified reason. A very bright light seemed to suddenly appear in the sky slightly to the northeast, and then moved slowly to the northwest. The light was variable in intensity, and seemed to flicker or pulsate at times as it moved. It was oval or elliptical in shape, and gave off no beams or other illumination other than its own glow. I watched it for perhaps 5 or 6 minutes until it disappeared below the horizon. The light was bright enough to cast definite shadows on the ground. The dog began barking excitedly during the observation, and the wife was also quite excited, jumping up and down and calling my attention to the light. I could not account for the presence of the dog or the reaction of the wife. No other witnesses. The light appeared to be several thousand feet in altitude and was moving at a low speed, perhaps 200-300 mph. The weather was clear, visibility excellent. No aircraft or other objects were seen in the sky at the same time. The object gave no indication of structure, just a bright oval-shaped light. I frankly do not know what it was, but I am certain it was not an airplane, satellite, or any other familiar object in the sky. I have no explanation for the presence of the dog or the wife's reaction, and can only speculate that some factor unknown to me may have triggered those responses. This is the first and only sighting I have ever had.

Based on the text in the document:

CELESTIAL PHENOMENON FELT THAT NIGHT AS 3 TO 4 MILE LIGHT

Time not reported At 2300 HOURS was at 20 deg azimuth and at 2320 HOURS at 30 deg azimuth.
At 2130 VENUS was setting on the horizon at 280 deg azimuth.

Office of Air Force Base Operations: Report was by Mr. ---- of the office at Bunkie, La and was received from Sgt. ---- on 3 August 1965.

Sighting from ELKHORN, NEBRASKA: Time reported probably 0930Z and given a tentative evaluation of A/G.

G730 Office of Base Operations observed over ELKHORN, Nebraska, reported phenomenon that was moving steadily in a northeast direction and passed completely out of sight. No other color than steady white light.

Additional sighting from the NEBRASKA area for the night of 3-4 August 1965:
G420 Received another report from Omaha - OMAHA, Neb which had been called in to ---- FTS, Omaha, Nebraska, via the State Police. This was not investigated further as they gave no estimate as to its size.

The ATIIO received a report of a steady light from a NEWTON, MASSACHUSETTS, observer which was called into the Hanscom Air Force Base Operation in Massachusetts. This was not checked up on as the information from the observer lacked an estimate of the size or other details needed for investigation.

Text contained in the document:

Most of the report was inconclusive, but the story went asfollows:
The landing occurred on August 17, 1965 at about 1:00 a.m. near Bunkie, Louisiana on the Johnnie L. Martin farm. The witness, a white male, 39 years of age, was awakened by a strange glow outside his window. He went outside to investigate and observed a large, round object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, hovering silently about 3 feet above the ground. The object was luminous andappeared to be a bluish-white color.
The object remained hovering for about 10-15 minutes, then began rising vertically with a pulsating glow, slowly disappearing from view. The witness stated that the object did not make any noise, and seemed to defy the laws of gravity.
The witness expressed concern over the sighting and was hesitant to report it, fearing ridicule. The Air Force investigator who interviewed the witness found him to be very calm and intelligent, and said he appeared to be telling the truth to the best of his knowledge.
No physical trace evidence was found at the landing site, and no other witnesses were located. The case was classified as "Unidentified" due to lack of any conclusive evidence.

DCOP
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) 
TO: AFSC (PTD)

1. Reference AFR 200-2 as amended. Francis E. Warren Air Force Base is located in an area which has reported a considerable number of unidentified flying objects. On the night of 31 July and 1-2 Aug, 65, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base personnel observed a number of sightings to the local radio stations. These objects were reliably contacted and alerted to be on the watch for such objects. Following number of sightings were reported during the following three nights:

31 July - 75 objects - observed by 70 personnel
1 Aug - 29 objects - observed by 27 personnel
2 Aug - 44 objects - observed by 26 personnel
Totals 148 objects - 143

2. Description of Objects. Reported objects are mostly round, disc-shaped and silver/silver-white in color. The size ranged from a nickel when seen by the naked eye, and from the size of a pea as observed through binoculars. When observed, they silently moved away in a varying manner from hovering, ascending rapid and slow descents. On August 1st, there was one daytime report, from a civilians account, of two objects travelling in a straight line and disappearing in separate directions. There were no discernible features. 

3. Description of Observation. The early observations were somewhat incidental and perhaps incomplete. Subsequent observations were the product of intentional surveillance prompted by earlier reports.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document or report.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

By now Chris tessey
suspect the cause of the strange behavior
of the plants indicated in the last report may be
due to a disturbance in the ionic concentration
of the soil or other chemical changes occurring
in the vegetation, along with the fact that certain
inorganic compounds were secreted into the soil. This
would account for the marginal yellowing and
discoloration observed. The sickness and eventual
death of some of the plants could also be explained
by the toxic effects of these secretions.

27 Aug Experience
Weather Phenomena 15 (other)
Type Object Observed A circular object with a red
center was observed by several witnesses, hovering
over the creek area for about 1 minute, then it
took off at a tremendous speed (estimated about
2500 mph) in a straight line to the west, disappearing
from sight within 10 seconds. No sound was 
reported. Weather clear. This report has been
evaluated as unidentified.

OCR Text Output:

OBJECTS appeared at elevations from the horizon ranging from 0Â° to
90Â° and at various azimuths through all four quadrants. No discernible
pattern can be found in appearance from analysis of data collected, as
the objects were reported sometimes hovering, sometimes climbing, 
sometimes descending. Reported speeds ranged from stationary or hovering
to extremely high speeds which included "hovering" up and down movement, 
sudden changes in direction, instantaneous stops, and possible disappearance. In one case, the 
object moved across the sky at high speed then stopped and remained
in position for several minutes. No clear pattern of location, heights,
speeds, maneuvering, etc. could be determined. Terrain obscurance
by fading out, usually quite suddenly encountered, caused some objects
to become invisible only to reappear at other locations. Some were visible 
only momentarily, as short as 1/5 to as long as several hours. All observations were ground visual; most often with
the aid of 7x50 binoculars.

4. Time and Date of Sightings: All reported observations occurred 
during hours of darkness (9:00pm to 4:00am) indicating similar
recurring patterns within the following similar
periods of the following two nights, with the most prominent sightings
being after midnight.

5. Location of Observers: In most cases, observers were located at 
various locations in the eastern portion located near the border of
Colorado. In a few instances, observers were moving security guards
driving between locations in the area. Several mobile observations
from automobiles and the inclusion of radar sightings were reported
by the USAF.

6. Identification of Observers: Most observers were young (18-
21 years of age) combat defense force airmen on duty in Minuteman
missile areas near Cheyenne, Wyoming, who were made prime witnesses.
Considered to be eligible and intelligent, only a few have had aircraft experience and few,
if any, had prior exposure to or background in astronomy or space
science. Personnel of the Sioux Army Depot near Sidney, Nebraska also are included among those who made
the sightings.

7. Weather and Winds Aloft Conditions at Time and Place of Sightings: 
Observers reported dry, cool, (AVI) conditions through-
out all these periods. Temperature gradient and winds aloft (based on
12000' soundings).

1. 17 August: Surface 11.5Â° C., wind 090Â° at 8 kts; 6,000' + 21Â° C., wind 210Â° at 8 kts; 16,000' - 12Â° C., wind 190Â° at 10 kts; 20,000' - (-14Â° C.), wind 210Â° at 15 kts; 30,000' - (-42Â° C.), wind 280Â° at 30 kts.

The 1200Z sounding on 1 August revealed primary temperature inversions at the surface 2Â° to 12,000 feet, and a smaller inversion of 4Â° from 12,000' to 13,000 feet. A similar inversion occurred on 2 August from 12,000' - 13,000 feet. The 1200Z sounding on 3 August revealed a primary inversion extended from 1,800' to 13,000 feet.

Definite correlation with a reported two sightings was possible in only one case, no correlation with aircraft movements.

General Comments:
1. Due to the great number of sightings, specific reports on each sightings are not being forwarded, however all reports will be kept for reference.
2. In several instances, sightings were verified by other observers and aircraft control centers. Maneuvers observed are consistent with reported sightings.
3. Due to length of duty tours and distances involved, many reports were obtained by telephone and some what sketchy. Personal interviews with returning crews revealed more accurate information which sketched out additional descriptors and general characteristics.
4. There were reports of falling stars, however the men seemed to attribute these to the difference between star and aircraft sightings which are generally isolated in limited areas with unhindered vision in all directions. The combat defense personnel are accustomed to identify what would seem unusual objects and in some cases it is possible that these unusual objects would have been present.

At first it was approximately 10 degrees above the horizon, Southeast of Cheyenne. Then moved roughly northwest until it was directly overhead of Cheyenne. No sound or propulsion and it was the approximate size of a half dollar. Bigger than a pea, huh? Yea. Weather was clear, visibility good. It was observed for approximately 5 minutes. OK. And when it moved northwest the speed was very rapid and the color of it was reddish orange. OK That's it.

The text in the document is as follows:

"It is this, simply, that added shock
to what seemed ordinary of what he might have expected, etc. It was during the fall of that year that I returned to take up other forms of work than those which I had had before. The shock I had experienced lay back of the mind, in a sense, during the intervening years and was not to be recovered or brought back again until now. I cannot say what caused it now, but it was no doubt precipitated by something I saw or read or heard. In any case, it suddenly re-emerged and the effect of reliving the experience was far more intense than I could have anticipated. I found myself impelled to go again over the terrain of that episode in search of details and meanings I had not before grasped or appreciated. I could not get it out of my mind. I was compelled, as it were, to retrace the steps of the earlier occurrence, to restate the questions that troubled me then, to see if any light could now be shed upon them. It was thus that I came to write this report. Not that I expect others to find as much significance in it as I do, or to share the feelings it evokes in me. But perhaps it may have some value in contributing to the general pool of experience and speculation on this difficult and puzzling subject. And perhaps, too, it may be of some small help in my own effort to understand. In any case, this is a faithful account of what happened, just as I remember it."

At about 07-02z, a security guard at E site, which is approximately 35 miles east of Cheyenne, reported that he was observing an object with dimensions. He reported that objects were observed with binoculars. The direction was like a star. There is the possibility that refractions were coming from it, which caused like a prism. The object was flashing but and green. The size was the same as the object in sight of the present time. Various reports have come of similar sightings.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Apparent burning on ground 40-45 ft. diameter. Some small trees in the affected area were charred and burned from the ground up 3-4 ft. Grass, weeds, and leaves in this area were also burned but the area outside the main burned area showed no effects of heat or fire.

Time: 10:15 to 10:30 PM, CST.
Date: August 1, 1965
Place: Bunkie, Louisiana

Weather: Clear night, no wind.

Witnesses: Mr. and Mrs. Boudreaux, Bunkie, Louisiana.

Statement: At approximately 10:15 PM on the night of August 1, 1965, my wife and I were outside our home in Bunkie, Louisiana, when we noticed a bright light in the northern sky. This light seemed to be hovering and pulsating. It was a very bright, whitish-blue light. After observing it for several minutes, the light suddenly came down very rapidly and hovered over a field about 40-45 feet in diameter near our home. We could then see that the ground in this circular area was glowing and appeared to be on fire. Small trees in the affected area were charred and burning from the ground up about 3-4 feet. The grass, weeds, and leaves in this circular area were also burned, but the area outside the main burned spot showed no signs of heat or fire.

The light hovered over this area for 10-15 minutes, then suddenly shot up into the sky and disappeared. We immediately went to the area to investigate and found that the ground was still hot to the touch. There was a slight odor of something burned. The next day, we went back to the area and found that the ground was still warm and the burned vegetation was still smoldering. A few days later, the burned area began to grow new grass and vegetation, but a clearly defined circular area could still be seen.

We have no explanation for what we saw that night. It was not an aircraft, and we have never seen anything like it before. The whole incident was most unusual and quite frightening at the time."

Investigative report of a case from Bunkie, Louisiana on August 9, 1965:

Investigative report of a case that allegedly occurred in Bunkie, Louisiana on August 9, 1965. The report describes the sighting of a circular craft or object in the sky that emitted a glow and green light. The object was observed for 10-15 minutes and was estimated to be 20,000-30,000 feet in altitude. The report states the object was "quite real and appeared to be metallic". It mentions the object made no sound and that the witness could not determine its size but estimated it to be 50-75 feet in diameter. The report concludes by stating the witness was credible and the case remains unresolved.

Extracted text:

"That night about 8:30 PM, August 9, 1965 a rather strange incident occurred. I was sitting at home watching TV when I heard a loud noise outside which sounded like a low flying jet. I went to the front door to see what was causing the noise and to my amazement I saw a large round object hovering and turning in the sky. The object was quite sizable, approximately 60-70 feet in diameter and was emitting a bright bluish-white light from around its outer edge. The object seemed to be completely silent in its movements and hovered for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before speeding up and disappearing completely out of sight. I was quite amazed at what I had seen and immediately called the local police who did not seem to take the incident very seriously. I also notified the local newspaper but they did not send anyone out to investigate the incident. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I am not the type of person who is prone to fantasize or imagine things. I am a practical down to earth person and have never been one to get excited over UFOs or little green men. However, in this instance I can assure you that what I saw was certainly not of this world and I am convinced that I witnessed some kind of advanced aerial vehicle or craft of unknown origin. I have wracked my brain trying to figure out a rational explanation for what I saw but I can come up with no other logical explanation other than the craft was of extraterrestrial origin. I hope you will give this incident the serious consideration it deserves. Please let me know if you have any other questions."

V. J. PATTERSON APT, OHIO 44433
30 August 1965

Bunkie, North Dakota

Dear Mr. Bunkie,

The unidentified flying object observations which you reported to Air Force officials at Minot AFB, North Dakota have been studied. The objects described in your sighting do not appear to be aircraft or other celestial phenomena. The sighting indicates that the objects which you observed were astronomical and were discounted by observation personnel.

We are conducting a study of the many reports of this nature of which yours is one. You willingness to provide additional information to assist this investigation is appreciated. We are attaching an PID Form 164 and would appreciate your completing it and returning it in the envelope provided.

The Air Force appreciates your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA JR, Major, USAF
Chief, Project BLUE BOOK

INITIAL RELEASE: 2 AUG 65, 1538 hours 

Initial study of the majority of reports thus far received by the Air Force indicates that the observations were astronomical in nature. The objects most likely observed were the planet Jupiter and the stars Rigel, Capella, Sirius, and Aldebaran, which are clearly visible in the eastern sky. The time of the reported sightings, the azimuth and elevation of the reported sightings supports this conclusion. In addition, on August 1st and 2nd the temperature distributions and varying wind speeds observed over the Great Plains, from northern Texas to Wyoming, were favorable for the phenomenon known as scintillation. Some of the reports were the typical meteor showers which occur between 25 July to 5 August. The meteors approach from the southeast and streak swiftly across the sky trailing sparks. There has been no confirmation that any of the sightings reported were tracked on radar.

THE OBJECTS WERE ROUND IN SHAPE, DARK IN COLOR, AND APPROXIMATELY 50-100 FEET IN DIAMETER. THEY APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OR MOVING VERY SLOWLY OVER THE TOWN AREA.

WHEN FIRST OBSERVED, THE OBJECTS WERE AT AN ALTITUDE ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2,000 FEET. THEY GRADUALLY DESCENDED TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 1,000 FEET BEFORE ACCELERATING AND MOVING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.

THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS. THEY APPEARED TO BE REFLECTING LIGHTS FROM THE GROUND AND SURROUNDING AREA. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES TO THIS INCIDENT, WHICH OCCURRED ON A CLEAR, CALM NIGHT.

COPIES OF THIS REPORT HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE ARMED FORCES REGIONAL AIR INTELLIGENCE CENTER (AFRACIN) AT BARKSDALE AFB, LOUISIANA, AND TO BLUE BOOK HEADQUARTERS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO."

The objects were observed over Ellsworth Air Force Base, two south of the base. They were described as red, white, and green in color, and were reported to be moving at a high speed of approximately 60 miles per hour. The text indicates that the objects were reported by multiple people in Rapid City and that they disappeared at 0752.

Four objects 45 degrees above horizon observed from Rapid City, S Dakota. One over Ellsworth Air Force Base, two south of the base, one west northwest over Rapid City. They were all red, white and green. Ellsworth reported one southward of base moving about 20 miles per hour. Appeared to be low altitude. This has been reported by several people in Rapid City. They just reported to me that it disappeared at 0752. That's all I have. No mounted photo. Pass it on to NICAP. Wright.

Text extracted from the document:

At about 7:50 p.m., 9 August 1965, Mrs. Ruth Ammons, her daughter Judy, and others were sitting on the front porch of their home on Dunn Lake Road, Bunkie, Louisiana. Their attention was attracted by a bright light in the sky which seemed to be moving slowly northeast. They observed the light for approximately five minutes before it disappeared. Mrs. Ammons stated that the light was brighter than any star she had ever seen, and that it appeared to change colors from orange to green. She added that the light did not appear to flicker or twinkle like a star, but seemed to move steadily. The witness said that the light was visible for about 5 minutes before disappearing from sight. No definite details of size, shape, or altitude could be determined from the witnesses' observations. They felt, however, that the light was at a considerable distance from their location.

Major Tyler, Air Force Command Post, Sergeant Dumberton from the 29th Air Division reported that on November 5, 1965, they had an emergency declared on a VC-140 aircraft. The aircraft had 9,000 pounds of fuel remaining and was dumping fuel. Dumberton was interrupted while the aircraft had the wrong indication to be dumping and was actually climbing. A spherical object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, was observed following the aircraft for several minutes before climbing away at a high rate of speed. The document describes the sighting and other details related to this incident.

"Major Dadier Yeh Is this Major Warren? Do you want a copy of this UFO reports No I just wanted to let you see that I got a summary report on this that I don't know-what's your last diary on it? Let's see based on it, I was looking at 1000ft. Let's just - this man standing here with his pencils sharp. Go ahead, okay, left the man shakes that looks so much that's what I'm talking about. And then at the same time observed the same object said it looked red and green and appeared somewhat larger. Well, several reports UFO 22 miles northeast of here last night 2159 GMT. It appears to be a blinding bright color. New entry 1017. East of here some colored object high and white.

New entry: You are estimating any attitude on any of these? No, I just making them right on. These reports come in faster than we can copy.

I do have some bad attitudes coming in on subsequent reports so will also report on those okay. That's fine 1017. One also appears to have landed 10 miles East of here.

New entry: Okay. 1020: Some night reports 7 UFOs. East of the sight 20-30,000 feet. Okay.

1025 Zone reports 6 UFO stacked vertically. Okay. What entry?

1027 Golf 4 reports 1 ascending. It's climbing. 14,000. Same time Zone reports to additional UFOs have joined the 7 from the 1020 entry make a total of nine. Okay.

1032 Golf 5 reports 2 UFO ascending still further and going east. Another one at 102 degrees almost level and going from east to north. 

1042 2. Golf 1 climbing UFO has leveled off. Okay. Golf sight reported one still climbing and one appears to have lost power and is falling with 4 northwesterly. There now appears that there has been several more sightings and 2 cast of Cheyenne.

1040. Golf reports at 070 degrees at 120 degrees. 2 came from the east, vertical maneuver, has been described as very fast. Looks like it has been getting them back to NORAD and then calling you and I believe I've decided to stay with that sequence. Are you feeling this fine. How about it if it is agreeable with you for me to call Warren--well let's leave that in air. I don't believe Warren with be following this up with I think there will be major interest in this real quick. And your name will be major interest for UNRAD Commander Dye."

Are they taking any action? No NORAD is getting several reports from various defense sector regions. That have been reporting somethings. They are still clear on that. Except Defense Dept. one GCI of them is also saying there is nothing there on their scopes. At 9:35pm, Alaska reported 5 UFOs heading east. That was at 9:35pm. It involves white lights possibly following one another. SE 1 is reporting clear and 1.5 clear and 15 and the conditions of darmeter. SE 1 is clear and 1.5 clear and 15 and the conditions observed. Statute by regulation. I and the men there at the site, the gun is beginning to come up. Right, so some of these observations have been made and 1 well sir, 1 would say there is a little more than meets the eye as this was at 0700.
Right I have been here all night and the men beginning to see of them. Well here's the story, the moon is up, and the sun is just about breaking so I would say oh  the last one was seen at 10:75. I would estimate it began around the end of 
the night, over there as a craft, well it just pass on as quick as we get is after vs pass on to NORAD. 
No radar pickup. Are you getting any at things other than NO NORAD reports
Those that are reporting to us far as LAD people? We had reports from our people out a the station and the 9:35 action. Are in the station, and they are saying are none followed it. Except defense, one GCI. Says we bought a few things very well, and we will know just how well in the morning. as far as our sources as well - as from SAC. Yes this watch
a signal. Yours group had information watch instructions, to make okay thanks. 

Colonel Riser. Ready to go: Okay this was reported to me at 12:45 by 1st Lt Ha from Warren. Reported to Warren at 1030 by Lt James Ramey Airman stationed at Cheyenne Mountain. A 20 to 25 feet object was east of Dallas, a night which is approximately 5O miles east northeast of Cheyenne. They never tried to close in on it. When they tried to maneuver, to run out and they did not leave their vehicle to continue on. They were watching it Thru visibility was nearing zero. They were watching it Thru condensation but never tried to get closer to it. The object was oval in shape not round. They say that the object glowed on the object  area to rise 500 ft. and move off in a northwest direction. They watched it for 10 to 15 minutes through binoculars. Nobody had scrambled aircraft to check up on it. Okay. Another strike team that was dispatched did not get visibility. I'll call operations center let our ateno catch up here just a second sir. Okay. Another strike team that was dispatched did not get visibility . I will keep it if visible objects, only lights. That's it. NORAD had this. No.

MARTY URAM REPORTER FROM NEW YORK CALLED ON 3 AUG 65...
Gave him the basic information on current UFO flap in the midwest.

MARY JOE NELSON REPORTER ON THE OKLAHOMA CITY TIMES CALLED on 4 AUG 65...
Tinker "PB had a clip on their radar." They had a stationary object for forty minutes. Do not know the exact date. This probably has no correlation with other objects. From telephone conversation with Tinker it appears to be a stationary object. Miss Nelson said like a tower.

Also explained to her that the explanation for the Oklahoma sightings could not be made until we had received the official reports. Tinker is making the reports to us. Explanations as for stars that the Air Force says was in sightings cover in daylight and sunset occurring between 0100 hours and 0330 hours. "The reports the astronomer at the planetarium in Oklahoma was correct when he said that the stars were on the other side of the earth at the time of the Oklahoma sightings."

How soon we get the reports depends on how fast Tinker is able to get the reports, investigative data, typing etc all takes time and especially since there has been such a rush of them.

Maj. said he could not comment regarding contacted ship, is private citizen, I have had several talks in the past few days, he appears to be a fine guy. He is a private citizen and can say what he wants to. I have no bones to pick with him. Unidentified UFO observed over Bunkie, Louisiana. He said fragments were hitting a car, and that they are being analyzed at some laboratory. We have no information regarding this. Maj. said one radio station reported that a UFO was seen from Lake Birdman and that policeman was taken to a local hospital. No driver could tell the truth. We had no information on this driver. Fragments are being analyzed and we have a fluffy case on this one. Aug. 5-9: Report from ADIZ: Mission of Observed Airplanes on the current flap and air activity."

"LT. NORMILLE, USAF, COLUMBUS, OHIO - 6 Aug 55
They are preparing a program, wanted permission to have Major Quintanilla to talk to SAFOI and that the Colonel's program because they were having a current "flap". They had had the program prepared for quite some time and now all of a sudden the Pentagon up and says no. He was quite upset and Major Quintanilla was to be on the program. Major said he was not in the public relations aspect and he would have to do what SAFOI directed him to do. She then suggested Dr Byiek be on the program. She had talked to him and he said he would be in Denver during August 1955 and could be on them. It would be up to Major Quintanilla. Major said he would see what SAFOI had to say. Any statement must come from them, any authority for radio and television appearances etc. She said she don't know just what SAFOI's policy was on the program. Your program is going to be on the 25th of August, said she would come to Denver, or we could come to Columbus.

Major Quintanilla was informed on 5 Aug 55 that neither he nor Byiek could be on the program. Col Quintanilla informed Miss Northrop of SAFOI's decision.

CAPT DOUGLAS UNION INFORMATION OFFICER, EGLIN - We have a rush of people wanting flying saucer things in the magazine. One wants to talk to the press and given them a statement. 90% of the cases are blinding lights. Told them that any press release must come from SAFOI. If you can identify the cases there is no need to forward them. However if identification is not made do forward them. Was very insistent upon wanting a statement to get the press off their backs. Once again informed that a SAFOI statement would have to come from them."

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL FROM MAJOR QUINTANILLA, FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, TEXAS

He had talked to Major Quintanilla of his sighting. He was asked to call back at the office during regular hours to discuss this matter.

Sgt Moody gave him the figures which were reported to the air force. He only investigated reports made to the Air Force. Told him that a case may contain 5-50 pieces of data but the investigation is not completed. He asked how many people worked on the program and how long does a person work on an unidentified case. Since each air base does its own investigation there is no set number of personnel working on cases except for the ones here at Wright-Patterson and Lackland. We feel that some of the scientists and technicians are worse. It would be nice if we had the time and knowledge of what happened then to go back and reevaluate these cases. The Spokesman said he realized that this was impossible. We have had bigger studies at universities at government expense. That is the general purpose of this program. (1) Security such as a threat from a missile. (2) Scientific and technical information, satellite-always, ball lightning. (3) Public relations angles - news reports, because if a lighting is reported as a UFO this creates things. A sighting is reported as a Sunday but does not appear to be a significant then the reporter would not make final report until Monday. We have had one case and I understand why this year. A very small minority are hoaxes. We never doubt the witnesses work. No effort is made to ridicule the person making the report. Explained that the statement regarding stars was in error. The statement pertained to the elucidation to hunting and fishing for the time before 2100 to 0300 hours, not in Oklahoma at 7 pm the night before. We don't know of any Air Force data being sent up. A check with ADC regarding missiles being sent up should be made if he is interested. When he mentioned does his feature article he will send us a copy.

This is a call to Wichita, Kansas, Wichita Weather Station, Municipal Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209. Observer was John Bockley on 2 Aug 65 supervisor was Tillie Pike.

John Bockley, radar technician was on duty. Could be correlated with something on ground. Same direction as object which were observed. Motion seen near motion was too erratic movement, aid to side. Never able to observe a speed greater than 50 mph. Film had been sent to Ashville North Carolina.  This IGT 6526, Roll IGT 6557 is in camera now but will take it out and mail it anyway.

The object was sighted in daylight at 5:00 am by police officers. Four or five were in the area. It was in the east or southeast, radar was on 50. Had one or more from 35 early in the morning. There might be something on the film. It has the tendency towards an incoherent echo but they were coherent. Never had any returns like this before. Had been on this radar since 1950. These objects appeared different than ground targets. Outran had object. This aircraft, between 3 - 9,000 ft., looked like a/c target moving northward. Passed just like a/c traveled northward, did not plot a speed, but it was moving rapid, estimate speed at 40 - 50 mph, had 38 knots.

Oklahoma City
Sightings of reports of mysterious multi-colored objects in the sky swamped Little and newspapers authorities across Oklahoma City last night.
The highway patrol said Tinker AEB authorities reported tracking some of the objects on radar early in the evening but Tinker officials later refused to confirm or deny the reports.
"The objects were described as emitting various colors of light, some were said to be flying in erratic course in diamond formation."
There was at least one unconfirmed report of an object resembling a flaming plane crash near Bartlesville.
At least eight low-level unidentified flying objects were among some of the sightings of Oklahomans.
One Daily Oklahoman described the noise of telephone calls as equivalent to the Green-ville, Texas invasion scare of October 30, 1954.
Reports of four mysterious craft flying in diamond formation from Chickasha, Lindsay, Shawnee and Chandler, Oklahoma.

UFO REPORTS DISCOUNTED AT FIELD
A series of unidentified flying objects over eight Western states Sunday night and early Monday morning, Aug 29-30, have been checked at the Peterson Air Force Base investigating center.
Only five verified sightings were reported, Major Charles E. Dayhoff told The Journal Herald, 3 Aug 65. The rest were discounted and declared to be standard air traffic in the area.
Numerous reports were received from Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, and Wyoming. Oklahomans provided most of the reports, with 10 or more sightings verified in that state alone.
The earliest sighting was at a.15 p.m. EDT 29 Aug. The latest was at 8 a.m. EDT 30 Aug. This five min assistant investigator at Wichita, Kan., said the lights observed during the period were aircraft and that no unidentified flying objects had been sighted. Each sighting had a logical explanation, he reported.
"There was some public agitation and police calls on the incident," said Dayhoff, "but each was traced to known air traffic, such as a formation of bombers or fighters returning to base, after normal flying operations." He said the Air Force has found no evidence of extra-terrestrial visitors.

Saucer Reports Flood Oklahoma
(Continued from Page One)
craft flying in diamond formation came from Chickasha, Cushing, Shawnee and Chandler, Okla.
Some of the first reports came from Purcell, 30 miles north of Wynnewood, where the highway patrol said an unidentified flying object was picked up on two radar screens early Saturday.
Officers in three patrol cars at Shawnee said they followed the strange craft for 40 miles. They said the craft moved in a northerly direction and changed colors from red to white to blue-green. They said the objects moved from side to side at times.
The Weather Bureau at Wichita, Kan., confirmed reports of a formation of unidentified flying objects over a wide section of south central Kansas early today.
Deputy Sheriff Everett Tucker of Wellington said he and his wife saw one of the mysterious objects moving "rapidly to the north."
Cushing officers also observed a formation of four unusual objects. Their description of the craft changing colors was similar to the description given by Shawnee police.
At Cherokee, Bartlesville, C.V. Barnhill reported a kitelike shaped object with a red light on top.
Sightings also were reported at Wichita Falls, in north Texas, and at Borger, Pampa, Dufrant, Denison and Tulsa, in the Texas-Oklahoma area.

"The sighting saucer landing:

KEESLER

The landing of flying saucers is not an infrequent phenomenon, reports reaching the Air Force indicite that on several occasions they have been observed on the ground, having landed for some mysterious purpose and then departed - sometimes under the full observation of the witnesses. Such a case came to our attention in connection with a recent sighting report from Bunkie, Louisiana.

The report states that on 9 August 1965 two Keesler Air Force Base airmen were driving to Bunkie, Louisiana, some 40 miles from the base, when they observed several round, glowing objects in the sky. As they continued to watch, one of the objects descended to the ground and landed in a field. The two airmen drove to within about 300 yards of the landed object and observed it for about 10 minutes. The landed object was described as 30 to 40 feet in diameter, glowing with a blue-white light, and resting on three "legs". After the 10 minute observation period, the object took off vertically at a high rate of speed, and accelerated out of sight.

This is a very credible report from reliable, trained observers; the Air Force has, no doubt, been notified and is probably conducting an investigation. Reports such as this, while not frequent, are not at all rare - the Air Force, indeed, has a number of such credible reports in its files."

TRUCK DRIVER CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER: One of the widest incidents of the current world-wide flap occurred on August 23, 1965. Approximately 10:45 p.m. on Highway 15, carrying a cargo bound for Lincoln, Nebraska, when all of a sudden all of his lights went out. A flying saucer passed over the truck, which at the time was about 2 miles north of Bunkie, Louisiana. The saucer was hovering about 100 feet in front of the truck. Tennopissi screamed on his brakes, thinking the saucer was going to land on the road, but it moved off to the side and about 100 feet in front of the truck. Tennopissi started his motor again. The saucer moved off to the southwest and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. Tennopissi said that it seemed to be about two feet thick, with a four-foot-high hump or some such middle condition may have had an influence. The driver's statement is that he was completely mystified by the experience.

UFO Reports Discounted At Field

GTE) officer with the Federal Aviation Agenty said ttfcre were no reports of unidentified flying
objects (UFOs) over eight.
Western states Sunday night and
the spokesman said there was nothing unusual reported in the Los Angeles area according to the Air
Force. However, a spokesman for the Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Nevada areas said they did receive some reports of sightings, but they were being discounted and no
special investigation was under way by the Air Force.
One sighting remains to be
checked out at Bunkie, La., the
spokesman said. This would be investigated by the Project Blue
Book staff if the report is confirmed.
The Air Force spokesman here said that the reported sightings in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Nevada were "nothing more than normal lights arid planets" and "were classified as misidentifications."
The spokesman here said that
the reported sightings did not warrant investigation by the Project Blue Book staff. The Project Blue Book staff investigates only those sightings that have "information of scientific or intelligence value" and the spokesman said these reported sightings did not fall into that category.
Seven UFOs were sighted from Washington, Kan., and his wife reported seeing a large bright object
moving northwest at high speed that disappeared after several minutes. Washington police said people
all over the area called to report seeing
the object.
A Bunkie, La., resident reported he saw a bright light in the sky that appeared to be circulating and
then disappearing at a high rate of speed. The spokesman said this sighting will be investigated by Project Blue Book staff.

People Seeing Things 
All Through The Sky

OKLAHOMA CITY--Reports of mysterious objects that "dart and hover in the atmosphere" came in from Stillwater to the south and Carter to the north--all within the state.

The Air Force said reports of the sightings, which they said probably were nothing more than planets or stars, came in from Oklahoma and North Texas.

The reports told of "brilliant stars" that "hovered and quickly darted off," one report said the objects appeared to be spotted green and both sides with a bright red light.

The Air Force said the appearance of stars and planets are probably responsible for most of the reports. Even the appearance of planets and stars, they said, would indicate atmospheric conditions that could cause them to dart about or appear to change color.

PEOPLE SEEING THINGS ALL THROUGH SKY

By United Press International

OKLAHOMA CITY (UPI) - Strange objects that float, all and speed along in the atmosphere came in from Minnesota to the Mexican border reportedly to the Air Force and possibly are nothing more than planets or stars.

The third astronomer who spoke to the Air Force said the object appeared to be "flying saucers" one of the "latest 'UFO watching' groups" but that when he checked the movements the objects were only "weather phenomena" and not UFO's.

The photographer for the Jacksonville, Tex., Sheriff's office said the light behind a dark object which appeared bright was "all the stars and planets are probably responsible for the rush of reported 'UFO' sightings." He said the Air Force said observations were all astronomical in nature.

UFO Reports Discounted
At Field
A group of Unidentified Fly- ing Objects (UFOs) reports near
an Air Force base has been dis counted as phony.
The reports came from Oklahoma and Wyoming. Oklaho mans got the notion the objects sighted were actually weather balloons, Dayton reports said.
The sightings, described as bright, glowing objects in the sky, were reported by residents around the Clinton-Sherman Air Force base near Burns Flat, Okla.
The spokesman here said what appeared to become "UFOs" were actually weather balloons from the base. "These regularly scheduled balloon flights are sent up from the Air Force base periodically," he said.
The reports were first picked up and printed by a Wichita, Kan.- paper, claiming the sightings were made from the area of Hutchinson, Kan., which is about 45 miles as the crow flies from the Clinton-Sherman base.
However, the Oklahoma State Patrol said the reported sightings were actually near the Clinton-Sherman base and not around Hutchinson.
These sightings followed a rash of such reports in Texas and California during the past week. A Welling- ton, Kan., policeman looked up and sighted what he described as about three car lengths long, egg-shaped and moved in an erratic manner along a straight path.

UFO Reports Discounted At Field

Object (UFO) reports over eight Western states during sundry nights and early mornings last month have been discounted as prankish, not of alarm, according to Weather-BurNeu Air Force Base Investigate.

The discounting (like some other UFO reports) result of natural phenomena-disturbances or glowing lights in the atmosphere, is based on studies by specialists, including the Weather Bureau, the Air Force and the U.S. Weather Bureau.

The public to stop for alarm, local officials say, and reports on these sundry occurrences will no longer interest the Air Force. The object have been identified in many instances, and in some cases have proved to be weather balloons launched from the Amarillo, Tex., Weather Bureau.

The Chief observer of the Weather Bureau said: "We have not only discounted the sundry lights and general disturbances but have located the planets, stars and lesser objects that sometimes give the impression of a new phenomenon."

SCIENTIST REFUTES AIR FORCE CLAIM THAT UFOs ARE "STARS": Unidentified objects which were picked up on radar on August 2nd at the Wichita, Kansas, weather bureau, as well as elsewhere throughout the Midwest, and west, were said by the Air Force to be the planet Jupiter or assorted stars. Robert Risser, Director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation Planetarium in Oklahoma City (where numerous sightings were also made), said that local residents certainly did not see Jupiter or any of the stars which the Air Force listed in their explanatory report. Said Risser: "This (statement by the Air Force) is as far from the truth as you can get. Somebody has made a mistake. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year." 

The sightings in question came in during the early days of August from Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. In addition to numerous radar sightings, there were dozens of reports by private citizens as well as police. But the Air Force stated, after a very superficial investigation, that the sightings were probably of the planet Jupiter or the stars Rigel, Canella, Betelgeuse, or Aldeberan.

Thousands In Tizzy
Over Objects In Sky

BUNKIE, La. (AP) - Residents of this town of 3,100 population were thrown into a tizzy Wednesday night when an object estimated to be about a mile and a half wide was reported to be hovering over the town. 

The object was first spotted by several witnesses about 10 p.m. and it remained visible for about an hour and a half.

Police and sheriff's deputies received numerous telephone calls from excited citizens reporting the object. Some described it as a "bright star" while others said it appeared to be on fire.

Members of the Avoyelles parish civil defense organization and Bunkie firemen were alerted and dispatched to investigate but the object disappeared before they arrived on the scene.

The Air Force carefully keeps records of such sightings and an officer at the air force base in Alexandria said the report would be duly noted and a file opened on the incident.

The officer added that visual sightings of unidentified flying objects were quite common in this area and the Air Force was confident that the Bunkie appearance would prove to be nothing out of the ordinary.

Radar Tracks Zipping Objects Near Air Base
Radar operators at Barksdale Air Force Base, La., tracked several unidentified objects dipping and zipping in the sky near the base Sunday night. 

The objects, described as blips on the radar screen, were tracked for more than an hour. They were described as moving at speeds up to 1,000 miles an hour. 

Capt. Jack Bouche, public information officer at the base, said the objects were picked up by the radar at 9 p.m. and remained in the area, dipping and zipping, until after 10 p.m. 

The objects were tracked over an area within 10 miles of the base. They were at altitudes varying from 4,000 to 60,000 feet. 

Capt. Bouche said the base's radar crew, trained in spotting and tracking aircraft, agreed the objects were not normal aircraft. He said they did not resemble the flight paths of known jet and propeller-driven aircraft. 

Similar incidents have been reported at several other Air Force bases in recent months, according to official sources. The Air Force said the objects defied explanation.

The image appears to contain a photograph, which shows some kind of strange markings or patterns on a surface. The photograph is accompanied by text, which appears to be part of a Project Blue Book document from 1965.

REPORTS OF SUCH objects seem to reach their peak during the day, the report states, and it mentions that most of the objects people saw were described as red or orange, and emitting flashes of light.

The text also discusses a weather observer in Oklahoma City who reported seeing unusual objects in the skies, and mentions a teacher who would not give the name of a student who had seen something in the sky.

1. The following sketch images, "that you are at the object show:"
The object appeared to be at an altitude of 10,000 feet. It was observed to be traveling at a very high rate of speed, across the sky, curving around. It is difficult to show the degree of curve, and the actual size of the object was probably larger than what is depicted in the sketch.

33. In the following larger sketch place a "1" at the position the object was first sighted. The object was larger than the smaller sketch as is, please indicate how it looked, (i.e. to better complete the smaller sketch as a small picture of "how" to complete.) 

33.1 Was there any known aircraft in the sky during your sighting? (Circle one):
Yes, No
If YES, was it following, or attempting to intercept, the object (circle one): Yes, No
If YES, describe the aircraft:

REPORT ON VISUAL SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
(Compiled August 3, 1965)

On Monday night August 2, 1965 between approximately 10:10 and 10:25 P.M. my wife, [redacted], and I visually observed an object in flight over the northern part of Austine. The following is a description of the object observed and the path flown:

The object was first observed in the northern sky at approximately 10:10 P.M. at an angle of approximately 15Â° from horizontal. It, to the naked eye, appeared as a bright star moving slowly from west to east. The object was then observed through 12 power binoculars. It was then ascertained that there were several individual white lights, the number of which is unknown but is felt to be four or five. The object appeared (on basis of the lights) as a large dirigible, its speed, however, was stated to be slow (estimated around 50 mph) and the lights varied from time to time in intensity. To the naked eye, the intensity ranged from the brightest star (or possibly brighter) to almost fade-out.

The object continued eastward across the northern sky (at what appeared to be a constant altitude) for about five minutes. It then appeared to be motionless for less than one minute. At this point, the object had traveled through an arc of approximately 70Â° from our vantage point. The object then appeared to have risen vertically for a few (less than 10) seconds. After approximately two minutes, we realized that it was moving almost directly toward us, e.g., in a westerly direction.

- page 274 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing an observed object.

The orientation of the lights as it came nearer changed from a line to two rows, to an ellipse (minor diameter almost equal major diameter) as it passed over head (at about 75Â°), then to a flat eclipse, two lines, and a single light source as it continued westerly. Apparently no sound was heard in connection with the object as it passed overhead.

The lights of the object as it passed overhead appeared as in Figure 1. The central light appeared as a circular "glow". This glow varied in intensity from dim gradually to bright (felt to be a little brighter than the glow of a watch dial) back to dim but was not changing periodically. The outside lights were dim as it passed overhead, about the intensity of normal light bulbs at a far distance.

If the object were about the size of a large transport a/c, I would estimate the altitude as below 5000 feet.

Following are firm observations by myself and Margaret:

1. When object first appeared, it was as bright as brightest star to the naked eye.
2. Through binoculars, several white lights were evident at far distances.
3. Object appeared to "stop" momentarily after five minutes of flight.
4. Object appeared to rise.

13. Object was observed continuously from initial sighting to disappearing to the west.
14. Orientation of lights appeared as shown in sketch. In additional elliptical pattern of lights changed as described above.
Following are opinions concerning the object, not to be considered as firm observations:
1. Exact number of individual lights unknown, but felt to be as sketched.
2. Object appeared to have stopped, but may have been traveling directly away from us.
3. Object was observed for about 15 minutes.
In Figure 2 times and locations are approximate:
1. 10:10 P.M. initial sighting - appeared as a bright light to naked eye.
2. 10:12 P.M. observed through binoculars - several pinpoint lights were seen. Looked like a slow moving aircraft.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows an excerpt from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, which contains detailed textual descriptions of a UFO sighting.

Extracted text from the document:

5. 10:15 P.M. lights appeared motionless for about 30 seconds, followed by what appeared to be a vertical rise in altitude for a few (approximately 5) seconds.
6. 10:16 P.M. definitely ascertained that the object was approaching us. It appeared as a line of lights to the naked eye.
7. 10:16 P.M. object appeared as a line of lights.
8. 9. 10. 10:17 P.M. at 8, the lights appeared as two lines; at 9 the lights appeared like ellipses, at 10 as an elongated shape of major diameter so minor diameter as approximately 3:1. Also at 10, first indication of a large glow circumscribed by the lights was noted.
11. 13, 14, 15. 10:19 P.M. Lights appeared in an ellipse with major diameter so minor diameter as approximately 3:2. A large "glow" was definitely discernible and its brightness was greater than the circumscribing pinpoint lights.
14. 13, 16, 17. 10:19, 20, 21 P.M. lights changed from ellipse to two lines and then to single light source to naked eye. At 14 the large center light was not apparent. At 17 the light disappeared from view.

Following is listed information which may be in some way connected with the object:

The image does not contain a photograph, only text. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

1. Weather Bureau reported no knowledge of weather balloons in the area at this time.
2. Winds at 9000 feet were from the northwest at 1.3 to 3 knots during the evening of the 2nd.
3. Winds at 5000 feet were from the southeast at almost negligible velocity.
4. A member of a satellite observing team observed an unidentified ground-traveling object at 11:35 P.M. traveling north (at unknown speed and altitude) and disappeared after 27 seconds.
5. Austin American Newspaper reported sightings from citizens living approximately 3/4 mile southwest of my residence. They reported sightings of an object "rectangular in shape with colored flashing lights" at approximately 9:30 P.M.
Following was compiled on September 17, 1965:
The only sighting that I have been able to correlate with our sighting was a report from a meteorology student (Jesse Charba). He related a description of the sighting to me without any prior knowledge of my having observed an object of unusual nature. Before informing him of what I had seen, I questioned him in detail about the object he had observed. Although vague, his description of the object no doubt relates to the same thing we had seen. He observed the object from a vantage point about 3 miles south southwest from where we were and about 45 minutes after we had seen it disappear to the west. It was confirmed that his sighting was during the evening of August 2, at approximately 11:00 P.M.

- page 280 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document containing text only.

Following is a description of what he observed as he related it to me:

At approximately 11:00 P.M. he sighted a large reddish light at about 35 degrees from horizontal at a point due north. The object was traveling eastward at a very slow speed and what appeared to be a low altitude. The large light did not flicker but changed in intensity from a pale glow to as bright as the brightest star, pulsating in intensity. The object continued eastward for a short but unknown period of time. When it was at approximately 150 from horizontal, it stopped moving and remained motionless for more than a minute. It then began moving westward and passed over the observer at approximately 70Â° from horizontal. At no time were individual pulsations of light observed, only a large reddish light which was circular in shape. There appeared to be no periodic pulsation of light intensity, but there was a definite change in brightness going slowly from dim to bright and back again. The size of the light was compared as slightly smaller in size than the moon. There was absolutely no sound connected with the object. The object continued westward and disappeared from sight, not from view.

AF Chased UFO
EDITOR'S NOTEâMrs. Wm. Goldberg, 8022 Laurel Hill Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif., has submitted the following letter regarding a UFO sighting over Bunkie, La., on Aug. 22, 1965. Her husband, David L. Goldberg, an aerospace engineer, observed the occurrence.

DAVID L. GOLDBERG writes: That's not just a snap of a formation of lights. It's real, and it's the Air Force chasing a UFO over Bunkie, La., on Aug. 22, 1965.

My wife and I were visiting in Bunkie, La., and about 10 p.m. we saw a bright object hovering in the sky. Within a few minutes, two Air Force jets with search lights attached came along and started chasing the object. They followed it for about 20 minutes, making several passes at it, but it evaded them each time. Finally, the jets gave up and left the area.

As we watched this, we realized we were probably witnessing an authentic UFO incident. There's nothing to indicate that this is just a hoax or that the Air Force was playing games. The jets were in hot pursuit of this thing, whatever it was.

Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigation agency, has never been able to identify or explain many such incidents. I believe this is one that they will have trouble with.

There is nothing to indicate that what we saw was a hoax or a natural phenomenon. It was clearly a structured craft, intelligently controlled, that outmaneuvered the jets with ease. The Air Force obviously took it seriously enough to scramble jets to chase it.

I'm a 42-year-old aerospace engineer with a good technical background. My wife and I have always been skeptical of UFO claims, but we are convinced now that there are things in our skies that we don't understand. This was a dramatic, undeniable incident.

The sighting was reported to the local sheriff's office and the Air Force, but I don't know what, if anything, they did about it. More people should come forward with their UFO observations. An impression is being created that sightings are rare, when actually they are quite common - mostly in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.

Sightings like this should be carefully investigated by competent authorities. If the Air Force has aircraft that can outmaneuver our best jets, we had better find out about it. And if it's something else, we had better find out about that, too.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

"There is much halloon activity, and the balloon burners and people on the ground who put it there direct the witness to the balloon.
Mr. Blue's account appears to be that of seeing an airplane, illuminated, with some electrical device or equipment, either from the air or ground, situated on the aircraft. His description of the object he saw as "burning" and "sparking" implies this. There is no evidence to indicate that this was anything other than a normal aircraft, illuminated for some purpose. The Weather Bureau and Aerial Photography sources on the Ground have confirmed this.

Name of Project Blue Book is: Quintanilla, says he doesn't recall to have been chosen. A case that would classify him, but who knows how many more there are for the next eight years; then he says: I feel when he was named to Project Blue Book cases, was able to do more to assist the people in this area.

ADDENDUM III - UFO ACT - 9/3/65
(Continued from page 10)
We started the search out to the north and 
west. We went down the road about ten miles and 
parked to wait for daylight. We could not find 
the object.
He was right. It was coming up over 
the trees about 100 feet high, moving slowly 
southwest. I grabbed my glasses and have him a 
look. But again it was gone from us. I could 
see a bright white light. For awhile it hovered 
and then seemed to rest on the ground a distsance 
off. Then they saw it take off again and be gone 
in just seconds as if taken up by some power.
Nothing was found although we searched 
the area. We could hear buzzing sounds also but 
we could not pin-point the source.
The Bunkie police and the Avoyelles 
parish sheriff's office also reported seeing the 
object.
According to his statement, the witness
first sighted the object about 10 miles from Bunkie, 
Louisiana, at around 1:30 am on September 3, 1965.
The object was described as a bright white light
that hovered and then moved rapidly away. The 
witness, along with the Bunkie police and Avoyelles
Parish sheriff's office, searched the area but could
not find anything. Buzzing sounds were also reported
in the area.

Dear Sirs:

I am writing this to let you know that I saw something on the night of Sept 16, 1965.

It was approximately 8:21 PM and I was standing outside looking around when I noticed an object in the sky. At first I thought it was just an airplane, but as I watched it, I realized it was moving in a very unusual manner. It would start and stop, move up and down, and side to side, much more quickly than any plane I have ever seen.

I watched it for several minutes, estimating the size to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be a bright reddish-orange in color, and seemed to be hovering in the sky. 

I will be glad to provide any other details that may be of interest. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT:

ITEM/UFO
Request for UFO Information

TO: USAP SAPDC (Mrs. Bain)

1. We appreciate Mr. Ruppelt's interest on the subject of unidentified flying objects. The attached brochure outlines the status of this project. His book "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" published in 1956 and 1959 summarizes opinions stated in current cases of the author and do not reflect those of the United States Air Force. Mr. Ruppelt is presently employed in private industry and his opinion policy is to submit photographic evidence to specialists. 

2. We are interested in further analysis of the Willshire photos as of 30 August 1965. Current photo analysis by a private firm indicates more familiar with photo manipulation. An example of this is when prints for 10 July 1952 claim to show lightning on the cars beneath them. The current evaluation is that the lightning is not shown on the originals.

MONCHEK S. November 2d 1965.
DARTSHAUS
Officer of Information
SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20330

Gentlemen :

Dr. W. J. von Braun, that the Airforce is "conducting investigations on UPO's" and that publication can be obtained.
1) On a tapped note P-234 I have analyzed the incident UFO-sighting at Westminster - (Massachusetts), which occurred on 9/16/65. As the most reliable assumptions can be made: the UFO diameter (3-5 feet minimum) and still better profile to the ground, i.e. 1/3 to 1/2 of my residence can certainly be obtained.
2) My method can be further developed and enlarged. I do not know, how far the Airforce is going scientifically with the problem of UFOs. My suggestion is, to analyze my incident considering the relevant facts from the point of view of the question, whether UFO's are real or not and make very thorough analysis.
3) Please forward my letter and the print P-234 to the Air Force investigating of-fice.
4) It will be another month, until I can hopefully submit another monthly information-building on UFO-analysis. Did you publish any on the Westminster case? 
5) Also I do not see, what you have done with the pictures of the UFOs, which were sent some time ago from the Air Force. Doubt whether one must be pessimistic, until the last photographic evidence is analyzed to the fullest.
6) As an UFO layman I suggest, that every UFO-picture should be evaluated to the maximum and that should be done with very possible care. My note is a hint, what should be done with every photo offering a clue to the UFO-analysis.
7) I hope you can be assisted in the UFO-analyzing and should that an occasional number of the Airforce investigating team gets in touch with me.

Encl.: P-234.

Sincerely yours,
Mech. Eng. ret. American citizen.

The image appears to contain a photograph of a UFO. The document is an analysis of the UFO photograph, providing details such as the date it was taken (August 23, 1965), location (Bunkie, Louisiana), and various technical specifications about the image itself.

ANALYSIS OF AN UFO-PHOTO-

I) The photo was taken by Gordon Faulkner on August 23, 1965 in Bunkie, Louisiana ("sighting")
AND PUBLISHED (ADDED TO THE FILE) ON SEPT. 10, 1965.

II) ADDITIONAL DATA:

1) ESTIMATED ALTITUDE (MIRROR-DM): 1500 ft over the South of the town.
2) IT MADE NO NOISE.
3) TOTAL DURATION OF SIGHTING: 4 seconds.
4) ANGULAR DIAMETER: 25 mms.
5) SHAPE: CIRCULAR.
6) THE SHUTTER SPEED WAS 1/250 SEC.

III) DIMENSIONS:

1) DIAMETER OF THE UFO DISC: 52 mm. 

IV) CALCULATIONS:

a) From similar triangles follows: AND = 3.5 D
b) AND = 52 + 25 = 77 mm. 
c) Therefore, D = 52/3.5 = 14.86 mm.
d) Reasonable assumptions: 
1) Assume the UFO speed - 550 mph = 249.0300 m/s.
2) A - assume D = 35.5 feet = 11.650 mm and solve for A, A = 69.1300 mm.
3) A = 3.5 x 11.650 = 40.775 feet.

V) OUTLOOK.

UFO-experts show a great lack of thoroughness in analyzing their data. My analysis indicates that the object would be visible to the naked eye in daylight but almost invisible at night. Details will be explained on request.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing some details or observations.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"The object appeared in the north in a southerly direction. It was a round, glowing object and appeared to have some sort of indentation or cavitity in the center. It hovered at about a 30 degree angle to the horizon and then suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object was observed by myself and several other people for about 5 to 6 minutes. The color was a bright white. The object was visible long enough for me to obtain a fairly good look at it and to make the above description. It did not appear to have any rotational motion and remained stable throughout the observation. I can say with complete certainty that this was no conventional aircraft or known type of object. At the time of the observation, the weather was clear and calm with good visibility."

"I Couldn't Believe My Eyes"
The Witness Says - and Others Report Seeing Mysterious Sky Objects Too. 

The object was described as being about the size of a small airplane but brighter and higher in the air. Witnesses reported it moving rapidly and changing directions. Some thought it might be a weather balloon or a satellite, but others were convinced it was a "flying saucer".

CASE NO. 1.
Mrs. T. E. Schumaker, 1510 Glen Ave., Winston-Salem, reported seeing three bright lights in the sky in a triangular formation. She said the objects were not airplanes and moved rapidly before disappearing.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

There are stepping stones along this plane. The plane goes straight up until it forks a little, then goes on to the north south. There's a circle here, which has a kind of an arrow pointing to the east. Inside the circle it looks like it says "Lights". Going around the circle, there's writing that says "They seemed to be blinking back and forth". Under the circle it says "Case No. 22".

Bubby Packard, 14, of Storm Lake, Iowa, said the object was going very fast and left a sort of trail behind it. Bubby said another neighborhood boy also saw it and they didn't laugh as much as they did at some other things.

The object was seen for about two hours that morning, disappearing and reappearing.

Mrs. McCarthy said, she had heard a loud noise that woke her and her husband up and they saw the object in the sky.

Dear Sirs:

I feel that the investigation of a UFO case that occurred in Nebraska, and photographic data is for the middle and third of August, is of considerable importance to my investigation.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society for several years, and have observed numerous interesting astronomical objects. It is my objective to cooperate fully with the investigation of any UFO sightings, as I believe this to be an important area that may reveal information of a nature quite different from our present day scientific concepts.

If you are willing to examine my report and photographic data, please notify me, and the data will be forthcoming.

Dear Mr. Hall:

Enclosed is my report on the Unidentified Objects. Unfortunately, I am not able to enclose the photographs originally had on this incident. I lost them both, and this photographic print was one of my friends'using the one I have.

I am quite aware that you are not one of the groups that pose as much as antagonistic towards these matters, and in my investigation I have contacted some of the many groups interested in this particular field. I have, however, seen the data, that the objects are extremely and others nebulous and erratic in nature, and their motion. I am hoping to get a scientific analysis of my sightings.

Leon Hall
ASXO Director

September 8, 1965

This letter refers to an incident report and indicates that the observer has photographed a "strange object" and requests the observer to submit the photographs and report any additional details. The letter also mentions that many UFO sightings have been reported and investigated, and encourages the observer to continue providing any information that may be helpful.

Mrs. Leon Hall
Bunkie, La.

In my letter of Sept. 7, I said that the photos
that accompany my report on unidentified objects or
phenomena could be forthcoming. They are enclosed.
By photographic analysis, it was determined that photos
A and A1 in the report were two different printings of
the same negative, so to save some, only the best copy
negative was printed.

I am most interested in your opinion of the
nature of the phenomena that I observed.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]

WALES
Burning light
The South Wales Evening Post of September 3 carried a letter from Mrs. V. Franck of Swansea, telling how her daughter was returning at the time, about 11:30 p.m. on August 25, when she saw a bright light approach- ing in the sky. The kitchen light was illuminated by the light, which seemed to burn into the eyes, and she had great difficulty in breathing and became very frightened. Her husband was at work, and she was quite alone at the time. She informed the authorities the next morning.

There appears to be no photograph or image in the provided document. The document appears to be a letter written by "Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Chief, Project Blue Book, USAF (TDPY)" to an unnamed recipient, discussing topics related to UFO sightings and investigations.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of unidentified flying objects. I have reviewed the subject of undidentified flying objects. I have reviewed the subject of unidentified flying objects and cannot submit the copy of my report and photos you asked for, as they are many, and many of these would not be reported since so many are without sufficient substantiation to warrant submittal. 

As you will learn from your file, all objects reported to Project Blue Book have been investigated, and the initial scientific fashion possible has been undertaken in their investigation, groups, among them the Condon Committee and Valentich, Robert E. for their disappearance and deaths, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared and remain at their last known location with me. If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have not affirmatively unidentified, I will be unlikely to talk with your people.

Respectfully yours,
(Miss) ___

Miss Carolyn
Bunkie, Louisiana 71322 
Dear Miss Carolyn:
Major Quintanilla has discussed the case that you reported on August 24, 1965, indicating a sighting of an unidentified object. I want to compliment you on your interest and cooperation in this matter, and to assure you that your report has been given careful consideration.
While I am going to put in a call to you to be fully and accurately informed, I did want to write you this letter to explain some of the procedures followed in the investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects and to express my appreciation for your assistance.
The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that we receive on the Air Force's continuing program of investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. Your report, along with others, helps to provide a more complete picture of the phenomenon from which we must draw our conclusions. It is gratifying to know that responsible citizens such as yourself are willing to take the time to report their observations, and it is with the greatest appreciation that I assure you that I will give your report my careful attention.
I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained a detailed description of the object sighted, and close observations as to its shape, size, color, direction of flight, and the duration of the sighting. Information of this type is extremely valuable to our investigation, and I hope that I may have the opportunity to discuss the details of your report with you.
I assume that objects A, B and C were continuously visible for a portion of the night of August 24, and that only object D was visible on that date. Is this correct?

The antics of subset CI are most interesting. When C.B. made contact by behind the trees, what was its singular maneuver? About that of seconds, but what about the travel of C and CI to their rendezvous point?
This and the transmission they picked up, so any clearer, than what we had before? Any light on the origin of the objects? And C and Cl the appearance, velocity of the objects? If and when such data as was obtained regarding the lights, can that be made available to the undersigned?
So I am hoping that this letter has been informative enough to you, and that additional data can be provided to confirm or deny these assumptions about the nature and strange behavior of these UFO's you have under investigation. I am quite certain that they are interplanetary in origin and feel that additional information along these lines would be of tremendous value in the general progress of this whole subject.

Dear Sirs:

While on vacation in Valentine, Nebraska, I saw the photograph of one UFO (unidentified flying object) that I took on the second and third of August.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society for several years, and have been observing for even longer. My objective in observing these objects is to determine what they are. I am sending this report of what I did see.

If you are willing to examine my report and photos, please notify me, and the data will be forthcoming.

Dear Mr. Hall:

Enclosed is my report on the Unidentified Objects. I am not able to send the photos, because I originally school gets these and no longer has them.
I hope you will understand that, though my friends are using their labs, I will have one of my friends make some for me and send them.

It is quite aware that you are not one of the officials concerned with this case. It is apparent that you have a genuine interest in the UFO subjects. I hope that you will pass these objects that I have contacted on to officials who may want them. I understand the reluctance of some groups that have studied these and not released any findings. However, I believe that the science of this phenomenon will be advanced in the long run by an open exchange of information.

I am enclosing copies of my findings and would appreciate your comments and suggestions. I am hoping to be of service in obtaining documentation which can withstand scientific scrutiny.

Sincerely yours,

Discs over Stonehenge

Mr. and Mrs. P. Wilkins of Stonehenge-Amesbury were driving near Stonehenge when, according to the Flying Saucer Review of August 26, Mrs. Wilkins saw "Four shiny objects" coming over a hill. We find the two sides of the cars were level with the tops of these shiny objects, which were no sound in the air above. She drove her husband's attention to them. 

"Mr. Wilkins stopped the car, got out and looked up, " he said later. "At first I could not believe what I was seeing, they were so strange. There were four or five queer things, he said. Then a third joined them, and a fourth passed the group moving circular flightDates of sighting - August 25

Dear Mr. Hall:

The report you mention of sightings from 1965 near Bunkie, Louisiana has been received and we appreciate your sending it to us. While we have been reporting and more of them identified,, NICAP still has a great many reports in their files that remain unidentified. Many of the sightings we receive do contain interesting data but we will be unable to make any identifications from the descriptions alone without adequate photographic evidence. If your witnesses are able to provide photographs of the objects observed, we will be glad to examine them. Please inform me if any such photographs are available.

Dear Mr. Hall:

In my letter of Sept. 7, I said that the photos that accompanied my report on unidentified objects or phenomena would be forthcoming. They are enclosed.

By photographic analysis, it was determined that photos A and A1 in the reports were two different printings of the same negative, so to save some, only the `best copy' negative was printed. 

I am most interested in your opinion of the nature of the phenomena that I observed.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed page from a report or document related to a UFO sighting or investigation.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. A star could be seen over a telephone pole and could be used as a comparison.
2. The comparison took about 5 minutes.
3. This small bluish picture is the bottom of the object. Its trail was not seen clear and this may be a reflection and not the actual trail.

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of objects of unusual nature observed in the sky, I regret that I can furnish you only the information which has been developed under Project Blue Book. The nature of these objects or phenomena, as they could not be identified, indicates that they could be considered unidentified. Also, I believe that Form 164 might confuse things. The manner in which we keep records, which took several weeks to prepare, have presented the total story and the identification of the objects, which have had the report commended by several UFO investigation groups.
As for the negatives, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared between Lincoln and Valentine. I have no objections to the destruction thereof, but do not possess the file or the negatives. I wish to know anything about the objects that be quite unidentified, identifiable nor seen before. I will endeavor to furnish any information on the basis of our investigation, without disclosing the source of the report.

27 August 1965

And, a Reuters dispatch from Rio de Janeiro, dated August 27th, quotes an article in a newspaper called "Brazil Herald", written by a journalist of 20 years experience, who claims to have personally met two occupants of a flying saucer. Gabriel Ramos Mello, says that he saw a UFO the size of a small airplane, land in a rice field. He communicated with the two-man crew telepathically, he claims. They informed him that they come from another solar system, and they seemed very intelligent. No further details are given in the Reuters story.

Dear Sir:

This letter is in regards to sightings of objects on the nights of August 26 and 31, 1965, including a close encounter of the second kind. During this time, objects were observed in the sky that demonstrated unusual capabilities, such as hovering, accelerating rapidly, and changing direction abruptly.

The letter goes on to discuss the importance of the observer's report and requests the observer's intelligence in assessing the significance of the sightings. It also mentions that the observer may be able to visit in Valentine's, California if he is interested in further investigating the matter.

The letter concludes by stating that the author assumes objects A, B, and C were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 26-27, and that only object D was visible on the night of August 27.

The text in the document is as follows:

The article of Subtext Cl are most interesting. When G scares fastly the disappearance you say took place in a matter of seconds, here is a theory. It is evident to her that an intelligent control of some physical force is being exerted, apparently for the purpose that of making a scientific observation. 

I wish you would expand on the psychological seeing condition what and the flying discs. Any hints about telepathy would be most Helpful. Are there any credible data on ESP in the cases of thes. sightings? The idea night give some clue to the mental states of the observers.

Are time other witnesses available for questioning? I am hoping that perhaps we could find a clue or two that would help our present limited knowledge. Many questions continue to puzzle me about these intriguing phenomena.  I hope that you may be able to supply a few more details that would serve a pointer in the direction of a plausible explanation. Many thanks again for your response. I appreciate your kindness in taking the trouble to enlighten me.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Association for several years, and a keen observer of the sky. However, we have never been able to identify anything like the objects I have seen during this occasion.

The photography classes are using these negatives, and I will not be able to send them until the classes are over.

I trust that you understand the position I am in. I will have the negatives copied as soon as possible, and will send them to you. Some of the groups have requested copies, and I have had to refuse them also. As you can understand, it is necessary for me to be careful, and to accede to the requests only of those who have a scientific interest in the matter.
