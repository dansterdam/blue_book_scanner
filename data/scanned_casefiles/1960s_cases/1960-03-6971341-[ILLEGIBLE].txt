10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Elongated white object, not tumbling but elongated with object, not lower than 10,000 ft altitude first sighted through several at 32 deg azimuth and west and disappeared at 146 deg on a heading of 156 deg. Appeared to have characteristics of satellite. No pickup on radar.

11. COMMENTS
Request for satellite information sent to ATIC was only reply we received. All indications are that the object was in orbit. Spatially 3 did not cover what April 6 to 15 believed that this was the object, however since no confirming data was available, and the condition was not included in the report, the case is listed as insufficient data.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☐ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other: Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown
