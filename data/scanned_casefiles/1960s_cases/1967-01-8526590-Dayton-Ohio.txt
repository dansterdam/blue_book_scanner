In February 1968, a film was submitted to Wright-Patterson AFB that was taken in Camarillo, California apparently in early 1967 or possibly even in 1965 (no date given). The "Object" appears as a very small indistinct image on the film. No one visually sighted the object despite the fact that it was reported that about 100 people were present at the time the film was made. Because of the age of the sighting, the extreme lack of data, and the lack of clarity of the image no investigation was undertaken. A tentative evaluation is that the image may be of the moon; but without the date, time, etc. no definite evaluation can be made.

1. Enclosed are the films that were submitted to this office for analysis. Study of this imagery indicates that the UFO is a relatively faint or no moon, the presence of which was not considered or noted during the "shooting" of the scene. Furthermore, it was noted by the source that apparently was used to the factor's lens, which in this case probably depended upon the movement or jogging of the horse upon which he was riding. In this instance, the man could have been between the horse's erratic movements causing the background (moon) to move in an equally erratic manner.

2. Should further analysis be required, it will be necessary to obtain the exact date and time of photography to order to confirm or refute the conclusion that the image is that of the moon.

1. Enclosed are the film that were submitted to this office for analysis. Study of this imagery indicates that the UFO image is poorly lit. Thus of the image, the processed film was not conclusive or useful during the "shooting" of the scene. Furtheremore, it was noted by the source that camera used was not color, but B&W, which in this case probably depended upon the movement or posing of the horse upon which he was riding. In this instance, the pertains would have been dependent on the horse's camera movements causing the background (moon) to "move" in an equally erratic manner.

2. Should further analysis be required, it will be necessary to obtain the exact date and time of photography in order to confirm or refute the conclusion that the image is that of the moon.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 68-74 in which Lieutenant Colon Quintanilla requested a photo analysis be made to determine the identity of an object visible in a 35mm motion picture.

2. ANALYSIS: A comprehensive analysis was precluded due to a lack of information by source. According to the source the referenced film sequence was made during "mid-morning" hours (local time) but the actual time and particularly the date of the "take" was not given.

3. Study of the imagery indicates that the UFO image is probably that of the Moon, the press of which was not considered or noted during the "shooting" of the scene. Furthermore, it was stated by source that panning was used to the actor's lead, which in this case probably depend upon the movement or jogging of the horse upon which he was riding. In this instance the pan would have been dependent upon the horse's erratic movements causing the background (Moon) to "move" in an equally erratic manner.

4. Should further analysis be required, it will be necessary to obtain the exact date and time of photography in order to confirm or refute the conclusion that the image is that of the Moon.

UFO - WO # 68-74                                                   29 October 1968

An examination of both the dupe negative and the positive revealed no evidence of physical or optical tampering. The image in question is quite indistinct and does not appear to contain any detail whatsoever.

An untold number of explanations could be offered, none of which could be proven or substantiated. The size of the object (if it is an object) could not be determined because of insufficient distance, focus, and lens data.

The image does not appear to be a printing, processing, or film defect. The most reasonable explanation, considering all the factors and statements in the report, is some kind of reflection off or due to some distant object on or near the optical system. The possibility exists, but is quite remote (due to the erratic motion of the image) that it could be the image of a reflection off an extremely high altitude aircraft.

DEAR SIR,

I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT OF UFOS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF SIGHTINGS IN THE GENERAL AREA WHERE I LIVE. SINCE THE SIGHTINGS WERE PERHAPS NOT IN LOCAL PAPERS ONLY, I FIGURED THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT REPORTED TO YOU. BECAUSE OF THIS FACT I AM SENDING A COPY OF THE REPORTED SIGHTINGS TO YOU. THE SIGHTINGS SUFFERED A & 8 OF THE SPORT ARE NOW DATED BECAUSE I SAVED THE ARTICLE BUT FORGOT TO DATE IT. NUMBER 8 WAS SPOTTED IN LATE SUMMER AND NUMBER 9 SOMETIME IN EARLY SUMMER. ALL ARTICLES ARE TAKEN FROM THE LOCAL PAPER: SHAMOKIN NEWSPAPER: IN NUMBER 8 OBJECT WAS TO HAVE LANDED IN A LOCAL FOOTBALL FIELD.

SHAMOKIN, PA. 1727

TWO UFOS WHICH APPEARED OVER IRISH VALLEY EARLIER THIS WEEK
MAY BE SIMILAR IN DESIGN TO THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECTS RECENTLY SEEN
OVER MICHIGAN. REPORTS INDICATE THAT OBJECTS SEEN IN BOTH SECTIONS
WERE IDENTICAL IN SHAPE, SIZE, AND CHARACTERISTICS. THE ONLY
DIFFERENCE NOTED IN REPORTS IS THAT THE OBJECTS OVER MICHIGAN
WERE SEEN WITH ANTENNAS ON THE FRONT SECTION, WHILE THOSE REPORTED IN IRISH VALLEY
HAD A SERIES OF ANTENNAS PROTRUDING FROM THE CENTER. AN ADDITIONAL
REPORT OF THE SIGHTING OVER IRISH VALLEY WAS RECEIVED YESTERDAY
BY THIS NEWSPAPER. ELMER JIM CHUSY, A MEMBER OF SHAMOKIN AREA SCHOOL
BOARD, SAID HE SAW THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT AFTER OTHERS OF A TOP STORY

HOVERED OVER THE CITY FOR FIVE MINUTES, THEN MOVED TOWARD THE SOUTH.

SEVERAL UFOS WERE VISIBLE IN THE ELYSBURG AREA LAST NIGHT AND
CAUSED WONDERMENT AMONG A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS OF THAT COMMUNITY. ONE OF
THOSE WHO STUDIED THE STRANGE OBJECTS WAS DAVID J. BLACKWELL, WHO SAID
HE AND SEVERAL OTHERS IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD WATCHED THE OBJECTS AT GREAT
LENGTH. THE UFOS WERE DESCRIBED AS COMING IN WHITE LIGHTS OF RED,
GREEN AND WHITE COLOR, BLINKED IN RATHER RAPID FASHION. ACCORDING TO
BLACKWELL, THE OBJECTS AT TIMES APPEARED TO BE ROUND, BALLS LIKE
A CIRCLE THAT MOVED UP AND DOWN. ACCORDING TO THOSE WHO WATCHED THE UFOS
THEY EVENTUALLY DRIFTED SLOWLY AWAY.

VETERAN SHAMOKIN PILOT SIGHTS UFO*****VETERAN SHAMOKIN PILOT
AND TWO PERSONS ABOARD HIS TWIN ENGINE PLANE SPOTTED A MYSTERIOUS UFO
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHILE FLYING BETWEEN WILKESBARE AND HAZLETON. IVE
BEEN GIVEN ANYTHING LIKE IT, SAID RAY HOFFMAN, FLYING DESCRIBING
THE EXPERIENCE. IF EVER I HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT REPORTS ABOUT MYSTERIOUS
UFOS, THEY ARE GONE NOW. HOFFMAN WAS FLYING A CHARTER FLIGHT FROM KEMPS
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO HAZLETON. AS HE APPROACHED WILKESBARE RADIO
CONTROL CONTACTED HIM THAT A LICENSED OBJECT WAS SPOTTED BY SQUARONE MOVING
VERY SLOWLY BETWEEN WILKESBARE AND HAZLETON. AFTER LANDING AT WILKESBAR
HE TALKED WITH SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ALSO SAW THE LIGHT. HOFFMAN, A LONG
LEG OF HIS JOURNEY TO HAZLETON, WITH --------
BERWICK ABOARD THE PLANE, WAS NEAR -------- SO MAHANY MILES SOUTHEAST
OF THE LANDING FIELD WHEN THE THREE OF US SAW THE LIGHT FOUND 10:30. "A
HOFFMAN SAID, IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT, LARGE IN SIZE AND CERTAINLY DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE THE ANY AIRCRAFT. THE WEATHER PILOT REPORTED THAT THE MAHANY
HIS PLANE AND HEADED TOWARD THE OBJECT. HE WAS WITHIN 5 MILES OF IT
WHEN THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT SEEMED TO FADE AND NORTHEAST AT A SPEED
THREE TIMES AS FAST AS WE COULD TRAVEL. HOFFMAN TOLD NEWSMEN THAT HE
HAS WATCHED CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN HIS PLANE AND THE UFO. BEFORE HE CUT
OFF CLOSE ENOUGH -------- SAID THE OBJECT SPED AWAY AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT
IN SEVERAL MINUTES. HOFFMAN WAS GOING ABOUT 330 MILES PER HOUR AND COULD
ONLY PICK UP -------- SPEED OF THE OBJECT WHICH WAS MADE BY HOFFMAN TO WILKES
FLIGHT SERVICE WHICH IN TURN REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.
ASKED WHETHER THE LIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN A REFLECTION FROM THE SKY OR
SOMETHING HOFFMAN DEFINITELY SAID NO. HE SAID THAT AFTER TALKING TO
AN REFLECTION OR ANY OTHER KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT, IN SERVICE TODAY,
HOFFMAN, WHO WAS A COMMERCIAL PILOT, SAID HE WAS CONVINCED THE OBJECT
APPEARED HAS BEEN A LICENSED PILOT SINCE 1926 IN 1926. IVE "MAHANY FREE
WILL" OF SIGHTINGS THAT MYSTIFYING OBJECT, HE SAID. AND ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE, FROM WHAT MY PASSENGERS AND I EXPERIENCED
AN CONVINCED THAT THE LIGHT WAS CAUSED BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN ANOTHER
AIRCRAFT OR A REFLECTION.
