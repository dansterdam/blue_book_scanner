The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a typed Project Blue Book report.

In February 1965, a file was submitted to Wright-Patterson AFB that was examined by the Aerial Phenomena Group. The document describes an incident that occurred in early 1967 where a very small indistinct image was observed on a film. No one visually sighted the object described in the incident. The document notes the extreme lack of data, and the lack of clarity of the image, making any investigation or evaluation difficult.

SEEING UFO FILM

24 i 1958

Universal City Studios
Universal City, California 91608

1. Enclosed are two stills that were obtained in this case for analysis/study. The film itself from which these stills were taken is being retained by USAF Intelligence Division, Los Angeles, pending further analysis. It is likely that the original film, now in their possession, will be forwarded to your office later for your information and analysis. The apparent motion and apparent rate of travel of the object as shown in the film are probably one of the most significant and interesting features, and are consequently the subject of special interest and scrutiny.

2. Should further analysis be required, it will be necessary to obtain the film from the USAF Intelligence Division, Los Angeles, for that purpose.

35 MM UFO FILM

1. A photograph was submitted to this office for analysis. According to the information submitted with the film, it was taken by an observer in Universal City, California 91803 on November 15, 1966.

2. A request was made by this office to have the film under technical analysis by the Photographic Technology Division, Processing and Exploitation Laboratory. The report submitted by the source that the film was taken indicates that the object in the film was observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and that the camera used was a 35 mm Nikon F camera with a normal 50 mm lens.

3. Should further analysis be required, it will be necessary to obtain the object dose and date of photography in order to confirm or refute the conclusion that the image is that of the moon.

The image does not contain a photograph. It is a photo analysis report for an unidentified flying object observed in Universal Station, Canalilic, California on an unknown date.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NUMBER: 69-76
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Universal Station, Canalilic, California
DATE: Unknown
PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF: IR
QUALITY: Good
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 68-74 in which Lieutenant Caton requested a photo analysis be made to determine the identity of an object seen in a 35mm motion picture.
2. ANALYSIS: A comprehensive analysis was precluded due to a lack of information by mid-making (source). According to source, the referenced film sequence was made during the object's flight. The data and particularly the date of the photography could not be determined.
3. STUDY: The imagery indicates that the UFO image is probably that of the Moon, the press stated by source that panning was used to the actors' lead, which in this case probably depended upon the movement or describe of this known or actual object (Moon), which is moving in an equally erratic manner.
4. FURTHER ANALYSIS: The analysis is required, it will be necessary to obtain the data and photography in order to confirm or refute the conclusion that the image is that of the Moon.

The image in this document does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed text describing and analyzing a purported UFO image.

UFO - 40 # 68-74
An examination of both the dupe negative and the positive revealed no evidence of physical or optical tampering. The image in question is quite indistinct and without detail whatsoever.
An untold number of explanations could be offered, none of which could be proven or disproved. The 15 of the 173 objects in the picture are not clearly defined as to shape, size, or distance. The data is vague and meaningless.
The image does not appear to be a printing, processing, or film defect. The most reasonable explanation, considering all the factors and statements in the report, is that the object is affected by some kind of reflection off of or within or near the optical system. The possibility exists, but is quite remote (due to the erratic motion of the image) that it could be the image of a reflection of an extremely high surface that is off of the optical system.

Dear Sir:
It can be easily the letter of a U.F.O. or a sight of this material light which started to move and seemed to stop at 6:30 P.M. on January 11, 1962. Dayton, Ohio. The number of witnesses were 5 who resided in the vicinity of Beavercreek, Ohio and noticed something unusual in the sky. It looked round. Colors there were many that kept changing. I went outside and heard the humming sound which was running, coming at a good rate. The object was silently, slowly moving. It was a clear night.

I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE SUBJECT AT UMS 5-1967 CASE AND A HIGH-POWERED LIGHT AIRCRAFT WAS SICKED IN GENERAL AREA WHERE I LIVE. SINCE THE SIGHTINGS WERE PESENTED IN LOCAL PAPERS IT IS A FACT THAT I HAVE A COPY OF THE REPORTED SIGHTINGS TO YOU. THE SIGHTINGS WAS NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT TO STATE IT WAS SOMETIME IN LATE SUMMER AND NUMBER TO BE 50 OR MORE STRANGE LIGHTS OBSERVED ALL APPARENT TO FOLLOW A PATTERN. IT IS REQUESTED THAT THIS BE FILED AND CONSIDERED SINCE THE OBJECT WAS TO HAVE LANDED IN A LOCAL FOOTBALL FIELD.

The text from the document is as follows:

"3 UFO'S SEEN IN AREA...TWO UFO'S DESCRIBED AS SAUCE-SHAPED OBJECTS WITH RED, WHITE AND GREEN LIGHTS MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH THE SKY. DURATION OF OBSERVATION APPROX 1-2 MINUTES. AT ABOUT 1:30 AM, CALLED MILITARY BASE BUT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING ON RADAR. AFTER THAT, OBSERVED OVER AN ADJOINING COUNTY. FIRST UFO DESCRIBED AS OBLONG-SHAPED, BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR WITH RED AND GREEN LIGHTS ON THE OUTER RIM AND AFTER HOVERING FOR A SHORT PERIOD, IT TOOK OFF AND DISAPPEARED AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED. AND DISAPPEARED IN MINUTES.

TWO UFOS WHICH APPEARED OVER HIGH VALLEY VALLEY THIS WEEK MAY BE RELATED TO REPORTED SIGHTINGS RECENTLY SEEN OVER MICHIGAN-REPORTS INDICATE THAT OBJECTS SEEN IN BOTH SECTIONS CAN BE CONSIDERED ROUGHLY SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE. THE TWO UFOS OBSERVED HERE HOVERING OVER HIGH VALLEY WERE REPORTED TO BE SAUCER-SHAPED, WITH RED, GREEN, AND WHITE LIGHTS FLASHING IN SEQUENCE AROUND THEIR RIMS, AND WERE SAID TO BE SILENT IN OPERATION, AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A MEDIUM-SIZED AIRCRAFT. ONE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT IN THE SKY WHEN HE FIRST NOTICED IT, BUT HIS ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY ITS APPARENT CHANGE IN POSITION. THE LIGHT MOVED VERY SLOWLY, HE SAID. THE OBJECT LATER SHOWED UP IN A DIFFERENT POSITION. HE AND HIS WIFE WATCHED BOTH OBJECTS FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES UNTIL ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY SHOT UPWARD AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED IN MINUTES."

SAM THIS REPORT A STUDY OF "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS". SOME FACTS WHICH HAVE COME TO LIGHT: A CAREFULLY CONTROLLED SCIENTIFIC STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT WHICH WOULD INDICATE EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN OF OBJECTS OBSERVED IN THE SKIES. MOST REPORTED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, WEATHER BALLOONS, OR OTHER KNOWN PHENOMENA. SOME REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, BUT THESE LACK SUFFICIENT DATA FOR POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION.

AFTER ANALYSIS OF VERIFIED SIGHTINGS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE SOME REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THEM REPRESENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OR VISITATIONS FROM OUTSIDE THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED "FLYING SAUCERS" OR "DISCS" HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AS MISIDENTIFICATION OF KNOWN OBJECTS. FURTHER STUDY OF UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA CONTINUES WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES.

MYSTERY OBJECT SEEN OVER DAYTON. ANOTHER REPORT OF A STRANGE FLYING OBJECT CAME FROM DAYTON OHIO WHERE A CROCKETT RESIDENT, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD THE DAYTON JOURNAL-HERALD HIS STORY. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE ABOUT 8:45 P.M. ON JANUARY 8. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHTLY LIT OBJECT MANEUVERING IN THE SKY. SHERIFF DEPUTIES ALSO REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT. THE U.S. AIR FORCE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY RECORDED IN THE AREA.

MYSTERY OBJECT SEEN NEAR HOUSE IN WOODLAND AREA - SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS FLYING SAUCERS. THEY SAY THEY ARE AS PLAIN AS DAY. THEY FLEW SILENTLY ACROSS THE SKY. THERE WAS NO SOUND MADE BY IT. ONE WITNESS STEPPED OUTDOORS AND LOOKED UP IN THE SKY. HE SAID IT WAS A DISTANCE AWAY, BUT LOOK BIG AND BRIGHT. HE CALLED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS TO LOOK. THAT CLOSE IT HAD TO BE REAL.

SEVERAL RESIDENTS OF FAIRVIEW WATCHED THE OBJECTS AT GREAT LENGTH. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE ROUND BALLS OF FIRE. THEY MANEUVERED IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND MOVED AT HIGH SPEEDS. MR. BLACKWELL, WHO ALSO SAW THE OBJECTS AT TIMES, APPEARED TO BE FOUND BALLS OF FIRE. THEY MANEUVERED IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND MOVED AT HIGH SPEEDS. MR. BLACKWELL, WHO ALSO SAW THE OBJECTS AT TIMES, APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT EXCITED BY WHAT HE SAW.
AND TWO VETERAN SHACKOIK PILOT SIGHTS UFO...
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO HAMILTON. A FLIGHT WAS MADE TO LAND NEAR A REMOTE AREA. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE THE GAS BETWEEN HIS PLANE AND THE UFO... HIS PLANE RACED AT OVER 300 MILES PER HOUR TO ESCAPE THE UFO, WHICH WAS FOLLOWING CLOSELY. THE UFO DISCHARGED SOME STRANGE RAY THAT CAUSED ELECTRICAL FAILURE IN HIS PLANE. THE LANDING GEAR COULD NOT BE MADE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, AND AS A RESULT THE PILOT MADE A CRASH LANDING NEAR A SMALL TOWN WITH MINOR INJURIES TO HIMSELF AND HIS PASSENGER.
