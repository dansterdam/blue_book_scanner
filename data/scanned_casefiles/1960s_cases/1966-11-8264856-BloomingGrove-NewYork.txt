8. PHOTOS: Yes   XX No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes   XX No
10. CONCLUSION: Astro(S/P)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer noted two different objects that changed in color; red changing to green changing to white back to red during the observation. The objects maneuvered erratically but always returned to the original position. The objects were observed for 15-20 minutes on several different nights.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation, without a definite azimuth of the object. It is difficult to definitely pinpoint the culprit.
