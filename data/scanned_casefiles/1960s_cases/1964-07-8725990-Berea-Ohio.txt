(Detailed report follows) 

Berea, Ohio 
Reported 8 July 1964 
11:40 PM EST

Report from Mr. X, age 28, male, Caucasian, high school graduate, married, employed as a printer. He was in the backyard of his home when he observed a large, lighted object in the sky moving slowly from east to west at an altitude he estimated to be about 500 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape, had a bright, luminous glow, and made no sound. It remained in sight for approximately 2-3 minutes before passing out of sight to the west. Reporting person appeared calm and sincere in his account; no indication of hoax or hallucination. 

Investigator's evaluation: Insufficient evidence to classify as either "identified" or "unidentified". Recommend no further investigation.

Subject: Unknown sighting.
1. On the evening of July 8, 1964, this observer was alerted to the presence of strange lights in the sky near his residence by a neighbor. Upon looking, the observer saw two strange lights maneuvering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet. The lights appeared to be round or oval in shape and had a grayish color. They seemed to pulsate and vary in intensity. The lights were observed for about 15 to 20 minutes before they suddenly disappeared. During the sighting, the observer attempted to attract the attention of other neighbors but was unable to do so.
Respectfully,

The image appears to contain a handwritten report with diagrams and sketches, but no photograph. As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

Propulsion characteristics, as approximately determined for this apparent aerial phenomena.
1. Apparent static spin of object.
2. For the attitude - desire to point nose toward higher atmosphere - seems to suggest a gravity propulsion system.
3. The size view - would indicate the object to be a low mass, high fineness ratio vehicle, thus could explain ability to maintain hover from a very low power source.
4. Met typical physical sizes of known projects, but much more substantial internal structure - typical of advanced propulsion system.
5. The apparent disappearance or transition to some less perceptible state - could indicate use of gravitic shielding technology.

The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch depicts a triangular or conical shape with measurements and annotations. The second sketch appears to be a schematic or diagram of some kind, showing a circular shape with rays or spokes emanating from the center.

TIME: 2130 HOURS

OBJECT DESCRIPTION: WITNESS OBSERVED TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS HOVERING ABOVE A WOODED AREA APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE AWAY. THE LIGHTS REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN BEGAN MOVING ERRATICALLY BEFORE DISAPPEARING.

INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES: THE WITNESS SKETCH SHOWS TWO GEOMETRIC SHAPES, POSSIBLY REPRESENTING THE OBJECTS OBSERVED. ALTHOUGH NO PHOTOGRAPHS WERE OBTAINED, THE WITNESS REPORT AND SKETCHES PROVIDE SOME DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIGHTING. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE REPORTED PHENOMENON.

MYSTERIOUS HERMANS FOLLOW UFO

Observer: Mrs. Archie W. Archie, 37, saw the peculiar object first. He was driving along U.S. Route 42, about 5 miles south of Berea, Ohio, when he spotted the object. It was about 1,000 feet up in the air, moving rapidly. He called out to his wife, "Look at that thing!", and she turned and saw it. It appeared to be a bright luminous object shaped somewhat like a cigar and was apparently about 25-30 feet long. It was moving silently at high speed, first in a straight line and then it started making darting motions. After it had gone on for a short distance, it suddenly seemed to "hop up" into the air, about twice its original altitude. At this point, Mr. Archie pulled off onto the shoulder. He got out of the car to observe the object which was still clearly visible, and Mrs. Archie also got out. The object continued its rapid, darting motions for about a minute, then suddenly the whole thing seemed to diminish in size, become dimmer, and then it disappeared completely. When it disappeared, there was no smoke, trail, or any other visible evidence of its having been there. What Mrs. Archie described as "something" apparently had been popping in and out of the larger object.

The color of the upper section were "dull", the divisions were indefinite. The lower section (the main body) was brilliant white, shaped somewhat like a cigar. It appeared to be about 25-30 feet long. At one point, the object started flashing a bright light, almost like a strobe light, at irregular intervals.

It was estimated that the whole sighting lasted about 6-10 min. duration. Observers: Mr. and Mrs. John W. Archie.

Comment: 2 signifies are an above-normal size one at position (20:25) lasted 2-3 minutes.

July 17, 1964
9:45 P.M.

Returning home at night of July 17, 1964, my husband and I were called outside to see a strange light in the sky. We rushed outside and saw that it was not a plane or star, but a strange, glowing object, pulsating and changing color. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball as it hovered over a nearby tree for several minutes. Then it suddenly shot up through the trees at a high rate of speed. It appeared very close - perhaps 200 yards or less - and I could see that it was not a plane or satellite or any kind of known object. As it hovered, it seemed to be about the size of a basketball. It was a beautiful, bright, glowing object, pulsating and changing color from white to yellow to orange. Then it suddenly shot up at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. My husband and I were both amazed and puzzled by this strange sight. We called a few neighbors and they also saw it. One neighbor got his camera and took a picture, but I don't know if it turned out. 

We cannot explain what it was we saw that night. It did not resemble any known aircraft or satellite. It was a strange, glowing, pulsating object that hovered close by and then shot up at great speed. There was no sound given off. We were both intrigued and a little frightened by this unexpected and unexplained sighting. It was a most unusual and puzzling experience.

Extracted text from the document:

"On Monday, July 20, 1964, I called the U.S.A.F. office in Dayton, Ohio and reported the incident. I was told no one was available to investigate it at that time but that someone would call me later on July 20, 1964 (Sunday). 

On July 22, 1964, a Capt. J. Holt Hargrave came to see me. He was most interested and said he would make a full report on it. 

On Monday, July 20, 1964, I also called the U.S. Air Force Tracking Station. I was told we had in all probability seen a distant reflection of one of the missiles that were being fired that day as part of a test program. However, I do not believe this could have been the case, because the object was solid and sharply defined, and it did not appear to move or change shape. The tracking station said that it was quite possible for a nearby object to come to a point of observation and disappearance, and that is not what the book says the Air Force should do. This is not what I saw.

July 17, 1964. (At the same time this occurred, there was a Mercury launching scheduled for that date, but it was postponed and moved to 1:16 P.M. on the 18th.) On this date, residents spotted a large, high-flying object hovering above and apparently sighting their location. It was a bright, silvery object, which hovered briefly, then sped away at a terrific rate of speed. The object was observed by a number of witnesses, all of whom were amazed at its sudden appearance and departure. It was a very bright, nearly motionless object which seemed to hang in the sky for a few minutes and then suddenly accelerate and disappear from sight. The weather was clear and the object was constantly illuminated, which was what made it so impressive to those who saw it."
