PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 6 Jul 61

2. LOCATION: 7 Mi SW of Manchester, Tenn.

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION:
☐ Ground-Visual
☐ Air-Visual
☐ Air-Intercept Radar

5. SOURCE: Civilian

6. PHOTOS:
☐ Yes
☒ No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 min

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: First sighted rising from ground near highway. Moved up and hovered for a duration of a few minutes. Appeared to be a round, white object which glowed white to size of a golf diameter. Moved from ground to air, then disappeared.

11. COMMENTS: Appears to be satellites possibly or a fairly rare phenomenon called a daylight meteor. A meteor or space vehicle better earth's atmosphere are so small they cannot be seen. Noting daylight, however, few meteors that are visible in daylight can be seen. Possibly satellites leaving a trail similar to an a/c.

12. CONCLUSIONS:
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical
☒ Probably Astronomical
☐ Possibly Astronomical
☐ Other
☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
☐ Unknown

LEFT OF POINTING THROUGH AN ARC OF 20 DEGREES. TOTAL DURATION WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 35 DEGREES ELEVATION AND SUBTENDED A FALLING TRACK TO AZIMUTH 269 DEGREES ELEVATION BEFORE DISAPPEARING. THE SIGHTING WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT TWO SECONDS. THE SIGHTING WAS GROUND VISIBLE FROM AUTOMOBILE TRAVELING ABOUT 65 MILES. SIGHTING OCCURRED 13:52 ON 6 JULY 1961 DURING DAYLIGHT. THE POSITION OF OBSERVER WAS 35 DEGREES 34 MIN N. AND 86 DEGREES 2 MINUTES W. ON 7 MILES WEST OF MANCHESTER, TENN. PRESENT OCCUPATION IS A ROCKET TEST ENGINEER.

ADC, HQ., AFCO. HE WAS A USAF JET FIGHTER PILOT FROM 1952 TO 1954. G. AT THE OF SIGHTING WEATHER WAS CLEAR SKIES IN AREA OF SIGHTING.

H. HOME. K. NONE. J. FLIGHT TRAFFIC NOT DETERMINED. RELEASED WEATHER BALLOONS IN AREA CONSIDERED REMOTE. K. REPORT SUBMITTED BY LT CURRENT K. MILLER, CONFIGURATION TECHNOLOGY, HEADQUARTERS, AFCRC.

OBSERVER IS RELIABLE ROCKET ENGINEER AND EXPERIENCED JET FIGHTER PILOT, CONSIDERED THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH CONTROLS AND STATES WHAT HE SAW WAS NOT A CONTRAIL. NO REPORTS OF METEORITES HAVE BEEN MADE OR REPORTED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS. APPARENT HIGH VELOCITY, GENERATION OF VISIBLE TRAIL ARE INCREASING TERMINAL LIGHT INTENSITY ELIMINATES

MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION. MOST INDEPENDENT FACT FINDING BY SIGHTING IN VISUAL RANGE OF OBSERVED SUGGESTS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SIGHTING IS PHENOMENA CAUSED BY TERMINATION PHASE OF A CERTAIN ROCKET OR ATMOSPHERIC CARRYING OF ORBITAL POINT.
