LOOK HUMAN
Salesman Chats
With Space Visitor

PARKERSBURG, W.Va. (UPI) — With police and
an Air Force representative listening, Woodrow Derenberger yesterday told of his meeting with a "spaceman"
who did everything — short of ask him to "Take me to
your leader."

However, the "spaceman" did — according to Derenberger, who lives in a country that is not nearly as powerful as yours. "We
mean you no harm."

Derenberger, a salesman and father of two, held a
news conference yesterday to relate the experience
he said occurred about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday while
driving home from Marietta, O., on Interstate 77.

ATTENDING THE conference were local policemen
and Air Force representatives who said he would
report Derenberger's account either to Washington or
the UFO investigative center at Wright-Patterson AFB.

Derenberger said the episode began when a "dark,
long object" traveling about the same speed as his
panel truck "cut in front of my vehicle and continued to
travel at some distance sideways."

The object was charcoal gray in color, he said, "apparently made of some kind of metal and shaped something like an old kerosene lamp globe, having a flat
bottom and a dome-like top." With no visible lights, it
inches above the pavement, blocked the highway and
finally stopped, he said.

DERENBERGER SAID the side of the UFO then
opened and a "man" stepped out, approached his truck
and told him to roll down the window.

In a "five to 10-minute conversation," he said, the
man communicated through "thought waves or mental
telepathy." Derenberger said his lips were closed in
a fixed smile.

He described the "spaceman" as about six feet
tall, 35 to 40 years old, "by our standards" and about
185 pounds.
