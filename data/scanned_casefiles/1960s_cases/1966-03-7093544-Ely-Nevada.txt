My husband and I went out to watch it with my daughter aged 9 and 11 years. It stopped dead still right over us and you could hear a humming sound which was the only time we ever heard it. Then it continued on toward the N. West. Here are the times, dates, and directions that I have recorded in the 2 weeks we saw them.

Indianapolis 22, Ind.
March 31, 1966

I would like to inquire of you the following information, if possible.

I have on several occasions had the experience of watching an unusual action. I had not mentioned it to anyone because I did not want to be ridiculed - However, last night my husband witnessed the same sight.

The time was about 11:30 P.M. Wednesday, March 29, 1966. I noticed as he scanned the skies, 7 very bright "stars" in a perfectly straight line.

I said nothing. I knew what was about to begin. My husband said, "That is something I've never seen - look at


- page 14 -

Here is the text from the document:

those stars, a perfect line."
I continued to watch after we had
gotten into bed. Our bed is placed so,
that we can look out into the sky.
He watched, too. But I had seen
nothing. Slowly the first stars started.
Sort of gliding, as in moving a boat
- - - motion. It disappeared
behind the roof of the house across the
street. My husband said "They are
moving". Then the second, then
the third - it took about 10-12 minutes.
All the while their lights first grey,
very bright - then almost gone.
Now to the right of the house was
a fifth star. I say star for want of
something better. It began its descent.


- page 15 -

Here is the text from the document:

that took about 10 minutes. It simply
slowly disappeared into horizon. The
last, brightest was directly above the
house roof. It began very very slowly
to descend. About 1/2 hour it was
gone too.

I am sending a sketch perhaps
it can explain more clearly. This
is always in the West, where I have
seen it. The roof of the house across the
street is a good marker. You can judge
the movement by the stars passing behind
it.

We are very interested in this.
At first last year I thought the first time it
was a space missile. It does not
occur every night. I don't tell
they are really stars, because their movements
are complete in 10-15 minutes. The first 3
the other 2 the longer.


- page 16 -

Here is the text from the document:

Can you supply any
information?
Please don't laugh. I am
sincerely interested, and not
given to seeing things. Now that
my husband has witnessed this
I feel, I can ask publicly
about, what it could be.

Thank you.
Mrs Mrs [redacted]

Now it is oct 27, 1966
And we see one very large
bright object. That things suspended in the
west then point of view about 35-45 minutes. Then
slowly moves on about 5-10 minutes has disappeared.

UFO SUMMARY (Haverhill, Mass. 3/29/63)                                SHEET 2

Russell described the light as follows: "A bright light of the intensity of an auto headlight 200-300 feet away. The light was at first dim white and as it moved in a left to right direction, it (an unknown) brightened, dimmed, and seemingly went out. After its brightening, and as it dimmed, it seemingly was replaced (?) or the last by a dim red and light followed the same sequence, in turn replaced by green and blue and again white, each following the same pattern and intensity."

As Russell watched this overhead activity, the circles circumscribed by the object's flight became larger as he walked. He noted the length of his driveway in a general easterly direction (about 85 ft.) still observing the lighted object. At this time, approximately 9:15 PM, the lights were drifting eastward. Russell ran into his home and asked his mother to come outside to observe. Russell came out, Conway came with his mother to the lighted object with him for about 10 minutes. At this time the lights were apparently near motionless and after hovering for about 3 minutes they suddenly gained speed and darted away in a WSW direction disappearing over the distant treeline. Russell estimated the interval from hovering to disappearing over the horizon at 3 seconds. (My compass bearings of the directions indicate, an azimuth around 310°)

Both Russell and his mother stated separately that the object/light left a short BLURSH HAZE OR VAPOR TRAIL behind it as it gained speed and left their sight. The vapor trail was of short duration.

Shortly after this, a neighbor of Mrs. Conway, Joel Pollard of Newburyport, Mass., who had left Conway's route and was on his way home, is reported to have sighted a similar lighted object and returned to the Conway's. Mr. Paul Conway, who was this time with his wife and part in the sighting, Mr. Pollard and Russell got into Mr. Conway's auto and drove along Route 110 where they again sighted the object and observed it through 5X binoculars. It was in the distant SW. Upon their return through the Haverhill Police station about their sighting at about 10:30 PM.

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
Clear, cool evening, stars clear and sparkling. Quarter Moon in SW.
No wind.

EVALUATION:
A. PERSONAL ATTITUDES -
1) During my visit to the police station, the two officers were reluctant to divulge any information until I fully identified myself and stated that I was a representative of the Conway family and was in possession of their address and phone number. The officers evidenced some interest of an NICAP and NICAP International letterhead to me. The police stated that the Conway and Pollard were well-known in the area.

2) Russell Conway impressed me with his clear concise story and answers to repeated questioning. I was somewhat surprised that I would ask him to simply sketch he could define a shape or outline of the object carrying the rotating lights. This is in opposition to the report and sketch provided by his mother.

3) "Mrs. Paul Conway's account, although basically supporting her son's, is 'interesting in the way she apparently believes that she discerned an outline and shape. She drew a sketch of it just after the sighting. It looked like a child's top.

4) Mr. Paul Conway's attitude was respectful and openminded. He did not feel that his observation, even though 'rough' through binoculars, was of much help and I agreed with his reluctance to fill out a report form.

B. SIGHTING EVALUATION -

1) Weather does not seem to be a factor in this sighting.

2) Astronomical objects can be dismissed as inapplicable due to the directions of sighting, motions of the object and the allowance in all accounts of the moon and stars.

3) The family is reasonably familiar with aircraft, both civilian and commercial. They stated that they can easily distinguish the sound of small craft, "helicopters, large piston aircraft and jets.

4) Russell Conway's story agreed in general and in detail with his report, and, since the total interview time, both inside and during outside "walk-through" totaled nearly 3 hours, many occasions for disparity were provided.

5) It would seem that Mrs. Conway's sketch and more detailed description are without credible basis, since -
a. Her observation of the object was at a greater distance than her son's.
b. Her son (Russell) could not substantiate her statement of shape and appearance.
c. The issue of Life Magazine containing the sketch and "quilted" description for Ann Arbor, Michigan, eight years similar to the sketch she had drawn and it was in the home and had been seen by the whole family.

Taking into account all the above testimony and reports, I believe the observed object to have been an unidentified category.

UFOs Sighted In Haverhill, Merrimac

Unidentified flying objects, which have been visiting other sections of the country in recent days apparently paid a call on Greater Haverhill last night, complete with blinking and flashing multi-colored lights.

Just after 9:15 p.m. 17-year-old Russell Conway, son of District Deputy Fire Chief and Mrs. Paul B. Conway of 15 Dove St., Whitier Road, home of the Conway's, noticed something where she observed "an object in the sky."

Mrs. Conway, noting Russell's excitement, hurried outside where she observed "an object in the sky." It was up, and it didn't act like an airplane. Unconfirmed reports could see four distinct colors, and I wrote them down. The object was white, with colors. They were: red, green, blue, and white. Mr. Conway told The Gazette.

"The object traveled in a big circle for a time and then took off like a comet toward Lee Highway, leaving a trail of blue light."

Mr. Conway's nephew, Joe Pollard of 15 Dove St., Newbury port, who had been visiting at home at the time, but did not go outside during the sighting, was awakened by his mother when he spotted lights, similar to those described by Mrs. Conway. Pollard was driving on Route 110 at the time. He turned around and headed back to the Conway's home where he reported what he had seen.

Followed the Object
Deputy Chief Conway in accomp- anied Pollard in his car along Route 110 and they reportedly observed the object moving in the same direction.

Mrs. Conway, substitute school teacher, said the air was "clear" last night when she made the observations. "I saw the colors and others did, also. We had never thought seriously about these things until last night, but we did see something."

Somewhat earlier last night, Merrimac residents near the Sacred Heart Church St. area after Wilfred Lavalle, 71 Church St., first spotted a flying light, described as blue, red and white, with the other colors in the background and the object moving around in the middle.

Several persons in addition to Lavalle saw the object, according to Police Officer Frank J. Mathews, who had been called to the scene from the police station at 8:05 p.m. Mathews also re-

A large group of people went missionary to Bear Hill, Merrimac, for some sightseeing unusual from that locality.

Meanwhile the UFO "Invasion" was reported in several locations. Some residents said they were convinced. Others were skeptical. Calls came into the Gazette from Haven Airport by night crew members, radio operator, and others.

In a sky-Gagliardi described as "perfectly clear" he saw the object and was convinced it wasn't a plane. He said, "It's peculiar. I was looking at a plane. Because it was standing in the same place all the time. He said he watched it 10 minutes before going back inside, but 10 minutes later he went back and the object was still there. "I just don't know what it was," Gagliardi said.

If an electric motor could be used some batteries charged with on the ground state in generators with the blades shaft to spin the batteries charged of the craft fight the blades shaft. Presumably would be the batteries charged. I do not know the generators could do more than furnish preliminary. I do not know the multi blades could do more than one engine on each end of the craft perfectly safe, as one engine could support the craft in emergency, obviously this would have been described as moving indication electrical power being used.

The platform carrying the balance of the craft shaft, would carry the load, such a craft should move almost immense to such a direction instantly such direction, instantaneous, no tail fins, a craft would move no other guidance, no tail fins, one wings, relying on one adjustment of engine.

UFO SIGHTING

Date: March 30, 1966
Place: Lemon Grove and La Mesa, California
Time: 8:45 P. M.
Observers:

Donald R. Carr
1613 Woodrow Avenue
Lemon Grove, California

Humberto Salcedo
1607 Woodrow Avenue
Lemon Grove, California

Merlin D. Gindlesperger
5985 Cowles Mountain
La Mesa, California
(Independent sighting)

Background

Neighbors Carr and Salcedo had been conducting their own private skywatch since the first of August 1965. Almost every night, except totally overcast or rainy nights, they were to be found at their appointed task. Many long hours had been devoted to this thankless, but to them, necessary and so routine task of watching, waiting. Somehow the secrecy was conducted while viewing the heavens through "Mr. Carr's 6 inch reflector telescope."

Merlin Gindlesperger was not known to the other observers.

On the evening of the sighting, visibility was unlimited. Echo I could be seen, and the sky was normally 8:00 P. M. (the exact time was not legible from the source).

It was observed to move into the sky, and to show at about 45 degrees above the south-southwest horizon.

ENCL 4


- page 53 -

The Sighting

At about 8:45 P. M. (time checked by both observers' watches), Mr. Salcedo saw a bright light rising, almost due West from the viewing position. He, at first, thought it was Echo I again, but, he said, he thought to himself that it was too soon from another passage by Echo I, and it wouldn't rise in the same place again, anyway. So he said, or rather, shouted, and saw the object when it was about an elevation of 15 degrees above the western horizon. It was rising at an angle of approximately 70 degrees to the horizon, toward the Southeast. Its ratio of angular travel was about 5 degrees per second. As it rose, it rapidly increased in size, indicating that it was approaching the observers. It rose to an elevation of about 40 degrees, before declining, at which time it was about 25 or 30 degrees from the noon, which was about 4 degrees Southeast of the star Pollux, in the constellation Gemini. The moon was in its half-moon phase, in the so-called "dry" position.

Direct comparison was possible between the apparent size or the component size of the object. The object, that is, the elliptical part of it, was about three-quarters the size of the moon at the time it faded out.

The object was a golden-white color, and was very beautiful and majestic. In was awe-inspiring, to say the least. The object itself appeared as a VERY SHARPLY DEFINED ellipse at an angle of perhaps 30 degrees to our line of sight. Looks like a coin on edge. Although no appreciable haziness could be discerned. Streaming back from the upper left of the ellipse was a very odd shaped double trail, which was curving, short, about three times the major diameter of the ellipse, and filled in behind the object about halfway back the length of the tail. The color was more intense around the edge of the ellipse and along the outer edges of the tail. A very definite impression of rapidly streaming particles of a elliptory nature was received by the viewers.

There was no variation in color between the ellipse and the tail, except that the ellipse was somewhat brighter than the tail. The ellipse was not as bright as the moon, by direct comparison. To repeat, the ellipse was VERY SHARPLY OUTLINED; there was absolutely no fuzziness about its periphery.


- page 54 -

The Sighting (cont'd)

The dimension took place over a definite period of time, between one and two seconds. Even as it faded, the impression of streaming particles was still present. It took on a ghostly appearance; the outline of the ellipse and tail being the last to fade away.

Both observers, while rather experienced in seeing many more or less spectacular meteors, innumerable satellite passages, and several other unidentified objects in the past, were quite shaken by the weird, eerie experience of the object. As Carr ran into the house to record his impressions of the object, his wife asked, "What's the matter with you, you're as white as a ghost!"

Unfortunately, Carr did not have his 16 X 50 binoculars with him at the time of the sighting. Therefore the binoculars, the object would certainly have been a fantastic sight, and its true nature determined.

The independent sighting of this "other-worldly" appearing object by Mr. Gindlesperger was, indeed, a fortunate happenstance, as it afforded the opportunity to triangulate it.

Careful and repeated measurements of the elevation and azimuth angles as seen from both viewing locations were made. The tall television tower at Diego area proved most useful in this respect, as they provided fixed reference points in which the position of the object could be related. Results of the triangulation were incredible, even after varying the azimuth and elevation with considerable care and size of the object were based.

An angle of 3 degrees was established between the lines of sight from two positions. Ground distance between the two positions was established as 5.08 miles. The other two angles on the base triangle were established by direct layout on a map of the area. Solution of this triangle gave a distance of 91.77 miles to the point on the ground over which the object was then located. Disappearance of this base of a vertical triangle, and using a conservative elevation angle of 36 degrees to establish the object's true distance from the observers in Leon Grove, a distance of 116.5 miles was obtained. Using this figure in a proportion to obtain the actual diameter of the ellipse from its apparent diameter, we arrive at a true diameter of 4,800 feet! This is a tremendous size, not only for a material object, but also for the glow from a rocket exhaust! (Remember, a sharply defined ellipse.)

The object did not have any appearance of being a rocket exhaust. There was no variation in its brightness, no flickering, no extremely brilliant spot of light, such as would be expected from a rocket exhaust. There was no smoke or vapor trail. The double tail observed was pouring off the outer periphery, top and bottom, of the large elliptical shape and could not be reconciled with the typical rocket exhaust pattern.

                                                 , June, 1962, P.800

By varying the viewers' azimuth angles to the object by adding 5 degrees to Gindlesperger's angle and subtracting 5 degrees from the Carr - Salcedo angle, we arrive at an angle of 15 degrees between the lines of sight. It is felt that this is an extreme extension of the actual azimuth angles. Solving this triangle gives us a true distance to the object of 20.5 miles, and an actual diameter of the ellipse of 846 feet.

Still, tremendous difficulty based on the two trigonometric solutions for distance, and an angular displacement of 5 degrees per second, calculated out at 10.17 miles per second for a true distance of 116.5 miles, and 1.79 miles per second for a true distance of 20.5 miles. It is the writer's opinion that the greater of the two figures is more nearly correct, since it is felt that the lesser figure is based on too great a variation of the azimuth angles.

Mr. Gindlesperger's description of the object coincided almost exactly with that of Carr and Salcedo, except that to him the elliptical object appeared more nearly circular. This would, of course, be true if were viewing it from a less acute angle. Also, to have a single of accent was less acute, or flatter. However, his estimate of its position in the sky at the time of its disappearance, when measured, was in close agreement with that of the other observers.

The object was reported to the Operations Duty Officer at Stead Air Force Base, Lt. McCleary, and the San Diego Union newspaper. The newspaper was requested to publish the report, so that any other observers of the object could be contacted for purposes of triangulating. But the report was not published. It is difficult to understand the newspaper's apathy, since they occasionally published reports of UFOs off the news wires.

In a telephone conversation with Lt. McCleary, on the following day, he stated that a satellite had been launched at Vandenberg, at the time of the sighting, but this could not be confirmed. Gindlesperger said that she had seen an announcement in the next day's paper of the satellite launching, and the time was quite different. This could be checked by someone with sufficient authority.

Attached hereto is Mr. Gindlesperger's statement on an official NICAP report form, and the trigonometric solutions to the object's distance, size, and speed.

Illustrated here is the geometry of the sighting.

Point "A" is the location from which Carr and Salcedo saw the object.
Point "B" is "ground zero" under the object at its disappearance.
Point "C" is the location from which Gindlesperger saw the object.
Point "N" is the point in the sky at which the object disappeared.

The curvature of the earth is neglected in this trigonometric solution.

Determination Of Object's True Speed

Angular rate of speed of object: approx. 5 degrees per second
Greatest distance of object: 116.5 miles away
Least distance of object: 20.5 miles away

(116.5)(5 pi)
160 = 10.17 miles per second

(20.5)(5 pi)
160 = 1.79 miles per second

Given: side "B" = 91.8555 miles
Find: side "b" and side "a"

Solution:

b/a = sec A
b = d sec A
b = 91.8355 ( 1.269)
b = 116.54 miles

b/a = sin A
a = b sin A
a = 116.54 (.6157)
a = 71.754 miles

sec A = sec 38°
= 1.269

sin A = sin 38°

Commutation of Actual Size of Object Based on Apparent Size

Apparent size of elliptical part of object: 3/16 in. = .188 in.
Actual distance of object: 116.5 miles
615331 feet = 116.5 miles
.0156 feet = .188 in.
2.0 feet = arm's length

By proportion:
.0156 : 2 = X : 615331
2X = 9999
X = 4799.5 feet diameter

By varying observers' angles:
Actual distance = 20.5 miles = 108451 feet
All other factors remain constant

By proportion:
.0156 : 2 = X : 108451
2X = 1692
X = 846 feet diameter

The object I saw was clearly outlined in the evening sky. The part that drew attention was what seemed to appear as a vapor trail behind a jet aircraft, differing then. It appeared wide. It was of very appealing coloring starting very brightly of sky, center, edges of the trail to getting dimmer of less coloring in the center.

The point of the object as I remember impressed me as being round & with an extra bleak ring around the front & center part.

As in relation to speeds of jet aircraft, this object seemed to be moving rather slowly. It became visible and to me an example, it became (as a twister almost beats up) and it went out of view, in the same way, perhaps fading out of view slower than appearing. Mildew Sandberger.

The sketch shows a circular object labeled "Silver or Aluminum Coloring" with a trailing "Reich" and other annotations.

The description of the object contained herein; the measurements of its elevation and azimuth angles, and the statements of the observers, are as accurate and truthful instruments, and not having had elaborate photographic equipment at hand at the time of the sighting.

However, it is felt that it has been established that a very large object, of extremely unusual appearance, was seen by the three observers.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Dear Sir,

I will a time explaining this object or sometimes objects to you because all saw them for 2 weeks as explained this time to you. This was the most interesting might I saw them. I never saw these objects alone and always called someone to watch them with me so I'll know I wasn't seeing things. I had never seen them before nor have I since. Although several times I have climbed high on an elk field where places are caving and going all the time. I decided to help a record of these sightings and will write them all down here as accurately as I can although there was one night I forgot to put down in which I saw 2 of them. I have the date or time on this but remember the direction. There was one being one side a spot when directly it stopped and I will completely still about 10 minutes. Then came a smaller red one. From S. East to 5 West. It met with the large one like a star and met to disappear completely inside. It for about 5 minutes then it came out again and headed back in the direction it came from. The big one started traveling toward the 5 West and finally went out of sight. Another lady that saw this was Mrs. Not Collins 37 Keystone Ave. Ruth, Nevada - then one night it went over our home.
