10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
2 bright light sources, as big as airplanes, which appeared to be airplanes or helicopters, were observed moving at high speed, almost silently, from southeast to northwest. They passed near the witness, with no visible strobed lights or sound. No definite shape could be determined, due to the extremely bright light. The objects seemed to glide and were white in color with a slight blue tinge.
11. COMMENTS:
Witnessed by several persons. Apparently was caused by two airplanes or helicopters, exact nature uncertain. They moved at extremely high speed and were quite silent in operation.
