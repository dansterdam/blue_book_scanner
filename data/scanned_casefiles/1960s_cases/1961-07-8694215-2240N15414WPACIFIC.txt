The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card from the Project Blue Book files. I will now proceed to transcribe all the text found in the document:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE
2. DATE-TIME GROUP
3. DURATION
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
5. LOCATION
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The object was observed by the observer for about 15 seconds at an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. It was brilliant white in color and appeared to be travelling at a high rate of speed. The observer believes it was about the size of a thumbnail held at arm's length. No trail or sound was noted.
9. COMMENTS: This appears to be a meteor, although the brilliant white color and high speed is unusual for a typical meteor sighting. Possibility of satellite or other man-made object is low. Possibility of aircraft or balloon is remote. Classification as Balloon is doubtful. Other possibilities are:
a) Meteor
b) Satellite
c) Unidentified
