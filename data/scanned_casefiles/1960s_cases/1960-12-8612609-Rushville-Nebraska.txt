11. COMMENTS
Several people reported object, one reported
color. One reported a sound like explosion.
Majority estimated duration to be few sec.
Longer than it would have otherwise. Description
is characteristic of solids disintegrating.
Direction indicates it was "overriding the
earth as it rotated, thereby staying in view
longer than it would have otherwise. Color
possibly from federal highway next to that
witness reporting it. Long duration reported
by 2 witnesses could have been due to
scattered clouds.

AT ELLSWORTH AFB, SDAK, RECEIVED TELEPHONE REPORT FROM SHERIFF AT
RUSHVILLE, NEBRASKA TO THE EFFECT THAT SEVERAL PERSONS HAD
SIGHTED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT FROM WHICH BURNING PARTICLES WERE
FALLING AND THAT THE SIGHTING WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE ODER OF TEAR
GAS AND A SMARTING SENSATION OF THE EYES. INVESTIGATING OFFICER

ARRIVED AT RUSHVILLE MORNING OF 28 DEC. AND INTERVIEWED ALL
WITNESSES EXCEPT MR. WHO WAS OUT OF TOWN. MRS.
VIEWED THE OBJECT FROM HER WINDOW AND WHEN SHE WENT OUTSIDE
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD EXPERIENCED A SHARP SMARTING OFF THE EYES
AND SMELLED A STRON ACID TYPE ODER. SHE CALLED SHERIFF HILLS WHO
ARRIVED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD AND NOTICED THE ODER AND A SLIGHT
SMARTING OF THE EYES. HE DID NOT OBSERVE OBJECT. HE SAID THE ODOR
WAS SIMILAR TO TEAR GAS. HIS INVENTORY OF HIS TEAR GAS SUPPLIES
SHOWED NONE MISSING OR DAMAGED. HE PRODUCED A TEAR GAS SHELL AND
MRS. SAID IT WAS NOT THE SAME ODOR. THE OTHER OBSERVERS WERE
APPROXIMATELY FOUR BLOCKS AWAY AND NOTICED NO ODOR AND NO
SMARTING OF THE EYES. THEY WERE ALSO NEARER THE OBJECT. MRS.

WAS SIMILIAR TO TEAR GAS. HIS INVENTORY OF HIS TEAR GAS SUPPLIES
SHOWED NONE MISSING OR DAMAGED. HE PRODUCED A TEAR GAS SHELL AND

LIVES ADJACENT TO A FEDERAL HIGHWAY WHICH IS HEAVILY TRAVELED BY
LARGE TRUCKS. IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FUMES ORIGINATED FROM THE
HIGHWAY AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE ODOR AND THE SIGHTED OBJECT
ARE NOT ASSOCIATED. THE PRESENCE OF NUMEROUS PRIVATE AIRSTRIPS
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF RUSHVILLE PLUS THE FACT THAT MR. _____
REPORTEDLY TOLD OTHER OBSERVERS HE HAD SEEN THE SAME TYPE
LIGHT BEHAVE IN THE SAME MANNER BEFORE, LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE LIGHT PROBABLY WAS ON A SMALL PRIVATE AIRCRAFT WHICH
