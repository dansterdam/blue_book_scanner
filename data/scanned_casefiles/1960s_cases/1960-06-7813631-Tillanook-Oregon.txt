9. COURSE
NNW-SSE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two objects connected, side by side. Rectangular, two lights, larger than pencil lead, bluish white. Level flight path. Gradually dimmed until no longer visible. Appeared 30° elev, azimuth 270° magnetic. Disappeared elevation 30°, azimuth 200° magnetic. Also reported as two bright lights about 3 ft apart, size unknown. Lights reflecting in millpond. Had straight line of flight. Disappeared instantly to SW. First observed at 35° in 240-330°.

11. COMMENTS
It is possible that the object observed was a satellite, but there was a later sighting made from Oregon which appeared to be a meteor, indicating a meteor shower was being observed. Therefore, the object observed by these witnesses was probably a meteor rather than a satellite.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
[X] Probably Astronomical
