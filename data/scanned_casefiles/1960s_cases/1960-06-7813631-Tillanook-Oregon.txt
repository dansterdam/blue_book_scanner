The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book record card, which is a document used to record details about unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.

The text on the record card is as follows:

1. DATE: 20 Jun 60
2. LOCATION: Tillamook, Oregon
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2235-2245
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GR-Ground Visual
5. PHOTOS: No
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6-10 sec
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: two
8. COURSE: NNW-SSE
9. COMMENTS: It is possible that the objects observed were balloons possibly sighted from the witnesses was a satellite, but there was no other sighting made from the region which appeared to be a meteor. Therefore, the objects observed by these witnesses was probably a meteor rather than a satellite.
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two objects connected, side by side. Rectangle. It is possible that the objects observed were balloons possibly sighted from the witnesses was a satellite, but there was no other sighting made from the region which appeared to be a meteor. Therefore, the objects observed by these witnesses was probably a meteor rather than a satellite.
11. CONCLUSIONS: Was Balloon - Possibly Balloon, Possibly Aircraft - Insufficient Data for Evaluation, Unknown.
12. CONCLUSIONS: Was Balloon - Possibly Balloon, Possibly Aircraft - Insufficient Data for Evaluation, Unknown.

The image contains a photograph, which appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. The photograph does not contain any human faces, so I will describe the contents of the image without identifying any individuals.

The document appears to be a report on a sighting of a "lighted object" with details on its movement, elevation, azimuth, flight pattern, and duration. The report includes information such as the time, location (Tillanook, Oregon), and details from the Air Traffic Control Tower and civilian witnesses.
