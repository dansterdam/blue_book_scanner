CHECKED RADAR AND WAS TOLD THAT NOTHING APPEARED PAGE 4 RUEBEAA7798 UNCIAS ON RADAR SCREENS. I DID SEE A SATELLITE WHICH CHECKED OUT WITH THE SATELLITE TRACKING REPORT. THAT IS THE ONLY THING I SAW. SOMEHOW A RUMOR WAS STARTED THAT ANDREWS WAS SENDING OUT A PLANE TO CHECK ON THESE OBJECTS. STATE POLICE CALLED ME TO CONFIRM THAT AND I INFORMED THEM THAT NO SUCH ACTION HAD TAKEN PLACE TO MY KNOWLEDGE. SIGNED ARC ALERT J. GRAY.

The object was observed moving in a south-southwest direction at a rather rapid rate of speed. It appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and was a bright yellow-orange color as it moved through the sky. It was observed for approximately 1 minute. The object made no sound and appeared to be under intelligent control. At times it appeared to be accelerating and making sudden turns. After moving a distance of several miles, it suddenly diminished in size and appeared to disappear into the distance. The object showed no resemblance to any known aircraft I am familiar with.
