TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

This is to certify that I, ROBERT P. HERRABRUGH, certilicnte number 240117309, did observe a fiery, round object, rather fast moving, listening object. I observed it through binoculare on Saturday, November 3 , 1962, about 1930 hrs. (5:30 p.m.) in the vicinity of Zanderij Airport, Paramaribo, Surinam, South America.

It did not seem to be a U.S. satellite, and I could not identify it otherwise. The object appeared to change course and direction several times. At first I thought the object was a star, but then I saw that it was moving in a parabolic course. It should be much obliged, if you could give me some information about what I have observed.

Sincerely yours,

Robert P. Herrabrugh
