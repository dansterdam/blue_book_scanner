SIR,

This is to certify, that I, Robert F.Herrebrugh, serialnumber 240181136, squadron adjudant of the Netherlands Armed Forces in Surinam, S.A., detached et Princes Beatrix Camp, Zendewij Airport, observed a rather fast moving, lightened object, i observed it through night-binoculars.

Direction: from almost North-West to almost South-East.
Date : Saturday, November 3, 1962.
Time : about 1900 Pq ( 2330 Z ).

What I like to know is this: could this have been a U.S. satellite?
I did not hear any noise of ( jet ) engines and did not see the usual red and green navigation lights, eventhough I was using night - binoculars.

At first I thought the object was a star, but then I saw it was moving and was not following a normal straight-lined course, yes was moving a parabolic course.

I would be much obliged, if you could give me some information about this.
