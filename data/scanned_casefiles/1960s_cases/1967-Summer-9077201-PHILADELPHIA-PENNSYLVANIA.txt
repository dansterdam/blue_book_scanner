Dear Ltr. Hegname re
I have written you in August of
1966 of U.F.O. sighting. Since then I
have moved to a new address. OVER â†’
However, in the summer of 1967 the
strange sighting took place. My
friend and I were sitting down when
we saw a sudden is jumping out of
of the trees. Clearly and could fly
look up in the sky we both seen
something that was weird but
believe. I'll tell both seen the
sign in U.F.O. about seven or
eight. These seem to. Well
then one of my friends yelled
and said "Look" & outside near
the U.F.O. too. All of a sudden
when it was going straight something
was to spin up. It was close
away is something that
LIKE

I will, was not close to tell
you then. I just would like
more information about the
U.F.O. sighting let me know.
