7. Did trackers report incident immediately when it happened or after film developed?

8. Were any observations of incident reported from ships at sea?
If so please furnish details, including ship locations.

9. Any hard facts or evidence to support "possible explanations" reached in part III of referenced message.

Part II. The following comments are offered regarding the possibilities broached: (1) that this was an IRBM. The timing coincidence coupled with the U.S. countdown, the geometric relationship, and the estimated characteristics of Soviet MRBM/IRBM propulsion systems strongly argue against this possibility.

(2) That this was an ABM. Able: This would have to be water-borne and this is unlikely in this time period considering the present Soviet land-based capability. Baker: The technique of interception during ballistic missile launch and check-out is not believed under development. Charley: The best estimates of a Soviet ABM capability are in the 63-64 time period. This would mean that the Soviets have a 3-5 year lead on the best estimated capability, presuming such a weapon is being field-tested under the described conditions. Regarding the other three possibilities, they may not be derived on the basis of data available here, therefore we do not consider comments appropriate.

LIGHT SOURCE EMANATING FROM THE IONIZATION CLOUD OF THE ATLAS-AGENA AND FLY AT HIGH SPEED APPROXIMATELY OVERHEAD WITH AN AZIMUTH OF APPROXIMATELY 292 DEGREES. (D) MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS POSITIVELY INDICATE THE GREAT IMPROBABILITY OF OBSERVING AN AIRCRAFT AT OR BELOW ANY NORMAL JET AIRCRAFT ALTITUDE SINCE THESE CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT AN AIRCRAFT AT 35,800 FT WOULD HAVE TO BE GOING ONLY 115 MPH IN ORDER TO CROSS THE TELESCOPIC FIELD IN SLIGHTLY UNDER 4 SECONDS AND AN AIRCRAFT AT LOWER ALTITUDE WOULD OF NECESSITY BE GOING PROPORTIONATELY SLOWER. AN AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NORMAL SPEED RANGES OF JET AIRCRAFT SHOULD BE FLYING WELL ABOVE THE OPERATING ALTITUDES OF ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN ORDER TO HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED AS THIS OCCURRENCE.

MSG CITE 61-39 DTD 15 SEPT61 AND YOUR SECRET CITE NEW 16-9-40 DTD

THREE PARTS.

PART I: BASED ON FACT THAT "BOGIE" IMAGE WAS SEEN ONLY IN BE
NEW CAMERA AT PATRICK AFB AND NOT IN SENSORS AT OTHER TRACKING
SITES, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT "BOGIE" WAS NOT, REPEAT NOT, IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO TITAN.

TIME WHERE "BOGIE" APPEARED, INDICATES THAT THE IMAGE IS VERY
PROBABLY THAT OF A STAR, NAMELY GAMMA PISCIUM. IN SUPPORT OF THIS

TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS COINCIDENT WITH THAT OF THE STAR.

PART TWO. THE CONCLUSION THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS A STAR IS FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTS. THE OBJECT WAS IN THE FIELD OF THE TRACKING UNIT APPROXIMATELY FOUR SECONDS MOVING GENERALLY VERTICAL. THE DIMENSION OF THE FIELD IN THIS DIRECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 1/4° AND THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE TELESCOPE IN THE VERTICAL PLANE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY .09° PER SECOND. A RELATIVELY STATIONARY OBJECT WOULD THEN REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 4 SECONDS TO PASS THROUGH THE FIELD. THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE TRACKING TELESCOPE IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

PART THREE. THE PROBABLE REASON WHY THIS PHENOMENA WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY AFMTC PERSONNEL IS DUE TO THE IMPROBABILITY OF IT OCCURRING. FOR THIS PHENOMENA TO TAKE PLACE THE TRACKING UNIT MUST HAVE A LOW ANGULAR RATE DURING THE PERIOD THE 1/16 SQUARE DEGREE FIELD OF VIEW IS COINCIDENT WITH A STAR. THE IMPROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY IS SUBSTANTIATED BY THE FACTS THAT THE DENSITY OF STARS WHICH CAN BE VIEWED WITH THE EU TRACKING TELESCOPE IS WELL BELOW ONE PER 1/16 SQUARE DEGREE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF THE LAUNCHING PAD AND THE TRACKING STATION PLUS MISSILE VELOCITIES USUALLY REQUIRES TRACKING EQUIPMENT TO OPERATE AT HIGH ANGULAR RATES.
