JANUARY METEORS
In northern Iowa is located the radiant point of this month's short Quadrantid meteor shower, named after an old constellation. Unfortunately, the gibbous moon will interfere with observations of shower maximum, which occurs on the morning of January 3rd. Under more favorable conditions, a single observer at maximum might see some 53 meteors per hour. This shower, somewhat like the Geminids and Delta Aquarids, is unusual in that it has never been identified with a comet.
