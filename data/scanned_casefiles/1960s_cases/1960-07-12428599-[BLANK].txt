[Rest of first paragraph partially illegible]

The meeting became a general question and answer session. Dr. Smart stated that the Astronautics Committee, the first half hour was something of a briefing of the Blue Book program, and an explanation of some of the phenomena and/or objects responsible for sightings.

The meeting became a general question and answer session. Dr. Smart stated that this information was being withheld from Congressional Committees. Major Friend pointed out that the Air Force was not in the possession of any evidence classifiable as unidentified with any proof or indication that midair, aerial phenomena were interplanetary vehicles. It was further pointed out to Dr. Smart that this would be foolish action on the part of the Air Force since the revelation of such information would be possible to the Air Force apparatus. Regarding classification of UFO reports, it was pointed out that Far 210 of AFR 200-2, dated 14 Sept 1959 (AFch 7), specifically requests that UFO sightings not be classified unless they could do something for the Air Force.

Private UFO organizations and such as Billentetter and that plans are to write to these men to determine the actual state of their connections.

ATIC Capability for Investigating Sightings of Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena

20 July 1960

AFCIN-446                THRU: AFCIN-42

1. On 15 July 1960, a briefing was held at the Department of Defense
for members of the House Armed Forces Committee, House Science and
Astronautics Committee and CIA. The subject of the briefing was the
Air Force Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program, and resulted from a
recent increase in Congressional interest on the subject. This recent
surge of interest is due in part to private UFO organizations com-
plaining that the Air Force investigations of UFO sightings left some-
thing to be desired.

2. Mr Robert Smart of the Armed Forces Committee stated that the Air
Force should have both the numbers and the capability to properly con-
duct the program, particularly the area of investigation. At this was
subsequently pointed out to mean that the Aerospace Technical Intelli-
gence Center should investigate those cases which give indication of
having high intelligence or scientific potential, and also those which
have an unusual amount of public interest.

3. It is estimated that 12-15 cases each year would require investiga-
tion by ATIC. It is further estimated that the cost of investigating
these sightings will average $200.00 each, or approximately $3000.00
per year. It is hoped that utilization of space available military
aircraft will reduce the cost of this operation or allow us an
extended capability.

4. Investigating these significant cases of sightings of unidentified
aerial phenomena, from the standpoint of qualified personnel, is within
the capability of AFCIN-42.

5. It is requested that the necessary action be initiated to make
$3000.00 available to AFCIN-42 for the purpose of investigating sight-
ings of sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

6. At the briefing it was decided that ATIC would be provided with an
inter-capability directly from the Office of the Secretary of the
Air Force. Appropriate accounting symbols to be requested by telephone.

1. L/Col Tacker, SAFOI-3d, telephoned Major Friend at 1530, Friday, 
8 July 1960, and informed him that an UFO briefing would be held in the 
AFCIN briefing room at 1400, Wednesday, 13 July 1960. Col Tacker indi-
cated that Mr Stu French and Mr Bob Smart, House Armed Services Committee, 
Mr John Carstorigan, House Science and Astronautic Committee, Gen Walsh, 
AFCIN, Gen Kingsley, SAFIL, and Gen LeBally, SAFOI, will be present. Col 
Tacker also requested that Major Friend contact Dr Hynek, Air Force Con-
sultant, and Mr Arcier, Scientific Advisor, AFCIN, to insure their presence.

2. Contact was made with Mr Arcier's office, and it was determined that 
he will be on leave until 25 July 1960.

ATIC UFO Investigation Capability

SAFOI-34 (L/Col Tacker)

1. During July 1960, ATIC participated in a briefing on the Air Force UFO Program for members of several Congressional sub-committees. Following the briefing Mr Robert Smart of the House Armed Services Sub-Committee made several recommendations directed at improving the capability of the Air Force to investigate significant sightings.

2. All of the recommendations that were made with reference to improving the UFO Program have been affected with one exception, the assignment of an additional officer to the UFO Branch to assist with the investigation of reports.

3. ATIC has accomplished what we feel is a better solution to the problem. Rather than utilize one officer full time, a group of four officers have been made available on a priority, on-call basis to assist with the problem. The UFO investigation requirement is cyclic and erratic; therefore, a group of officers can handle the task on a much more expeditious basis than one officer. Further, the officers selected for this duty have backgrounds in physics, chemistry, and electronics, and can be assigned to cases on the basis of apparent educational requirements.

4. It is requested that Mr Robert Smart be advised of this latest action to implement his recommendations.

SUBJECT: Congressman Heistand

1. On 13 June 1960, Col Tacker called Major Friend to inform him that he had been requested to brief Congressman Heistand on the Air Force's UFO program. The reason for the briefing was that Congressman Heistand had a scheduled interview with Mr Harold Salkin. Mr Salkin is one of the two gentlemen who visited ATIC during the week of 30 May as "supposed" representatives of ARGOSY magazine.

Mr Salkin requested the interview to gather information for an article on the UFO subject which is to appear in an early edition of McCALLS magazine.

Major Tacker, SAFOI-3d, Hq, USAF, Washington, D. C. called Major Friend 7 June and advised him that there is a very strong possibility that a Congressional hearing will be called on UFO. The particular area of concern with the lack of adequate investigation. Major Tacker indicated that during Major Friend's next trip to Washington it might be profitable to sit down with L&I and discuss the situation. The specific incident which was probably the cause for this concern was a case which was brought to the attention of a Virginia Congressman, and had not been reported to ATIC by Langley AFB. Langley AFB was contacted by phone and they gave their reason for not reporting the incident as the fact that the witness was a chronic reporter of UFO's and they did not feel that the case was worthy of investigation.

Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Hq, USAF
(AFOIN)
Washington 25, D. C.

1. On 8 December 1960, M/Gen McLelland, USAF, arranged a meeting with Col Hall, Deputy, AGC/I, to discuss recommendations made to the U. S. Air Force by Mr Robert Smart, House Armed Services Sub-Committee. These recommendations were concerned with the investigation of significant sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. Following the meeting Col Hall instructed Major Friend, AFCIN-4, to prepare a short summary of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program, and to outline generally what would be required to bring the program in line with Mr Smart's recommendations. This correspondence is a result of those instructions.

2. For the past 13 years, the United States Air Force has been charged with the responsibility for investigating and analyzing reports of sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

3. Air Force regulation 200-2, dated 14 September 1957, charges ATC with overall program responsibility as well as specific responsibility for analysis. SAFOI is charged with the associated public relations and still satisfies congressional interest. The Air Force case nearest the location of a specific sighting is responsible for reporting and investigation.

4. In the United States there are more than 50 private unidentified flying object (UFO) organizations. Collectively, these organizations boast more than 500,000 members. For the most part, persons belong to these organizations for various reasons, pure emotional outlet, ignorance, or possibly to use the organization as a "cold war" tool. The principal claims of these organizations are that unidentified flying objects are interplanetary visitors and that the Air Force is withholding information it has concerning them.

5. The most active and influential of these organizations is the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). This organization is headed by Major Donald H. Keyhoe, U. S. Marine Corps (Ret.). NICAP also claims such men as Vice Admiral R. H. Hillenkoetter, USN (Ret.), formerly of CIA, and near Admiral H. B. Knowles, USN (Ret) as members of its Board of Governors.

6. Strenuous efforts by Major Keyhoe and others to discredit the Air Force's handling of the UFO Program have resulted in two Congressional

briefings. The first briefing was in the summer of 1959, and the second took place on 15 July 1960. The later briefing was given to members of the House Armed Services Sub-Committee, House Space and Astronautics Sub-Committee, C19, and representatives from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.

7. During the course of the 15 July 1960 briefing Mr Robert Smart stated that the Armed Services Committee was currently investigating capabilities of the Air Force Bases, as currently provided, is limited to routine cases. He further stated that the Air Force should have both sufficient people and funds provided to permit investigation in depth in cases having special significance. Mr Smart requested that he and the other committeemen be advised of progress toward this end. He also requested that summaries of all significant cases be forwarded to his office.

8. During the period 12-20 August 1960, a rash of sightings occurred in the Red Bluff, California area. These sightings were handled in a routine manner by the Air Force, but apparently the conclusions did not satisfy the UFO public. In November 1960, these Red Bluff sightings came to the attention of Mr Smart. While querying SAFLL concerning the California sightings, Mr Smart also requested information concerning Air Force progress toward strengthening the UFO Program as proposed during the July briefing. SAFLL advised Mr Smart that the suggested changes had yet to be accomplished.

9. The following resources are available to ATIC for carrying out the UFO mission:

a. The Aerial Phenomena Group monitors the overall program and maintains the project files.

b. The scientific and technical capabilities of ATIC, and in addition, the facilities of AMRC, NASA, FBI and the Bureau of Standards provide assistance with the analysis of reports of sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

c. Special source information such as missile firing schedules, satellite data, balloon release schedules, special flight information, and weather data is available from the appropriate agency.

d. ATIC contracts the services of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, head of the Department of Astronomy of Northwestern University and Director of its Dearborn Observatory, as scientific consultant for the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program. Dr Hynek's services cost $3,000 per year.

10. To satisfy the proposal outlined by Mr Smart, the following would be required:

2

- page 17 -

a. Assignment of one additional officer to the Aerial Phenomena Group. Present strength is one commissioned officer and one non-commissioned officer.

b. An increase in the services of Dr Irving at an estimated additional cost of $1000 per year.

c. Additional travel funds in the amount of $3000 per year.

d. Procurement of a polaroid camera and geiger counter for field investigation work.

11. ATIC is attempting to fulfill the responsibilities assigned by AFR 200-2. The proposed increase in scope of UFO investigation and analysis, however, can be adequately accomplished only by the increase of resources as stated.

1. A briefing on the Air Force Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program
was held for members of the House Armed Services Committee, House
Space and Astronautics Committee and CIA on 15 July 1960. During the
ensuing discussion in the Robert Smart of the House Armed Forces Committee
stated that due to the usually limited technical capability of the Air

which give indication of having special significance.

2. The ATIC Aerial Phenomena Group is presently staffed with one
commissioned officer and one non-commissioned officer. To adequately
conduct the additional function of investigation of significant sightings,
this office requires the assignment of an additional officer.

3. It is estimated that it will cost $3000.00 per year travel funds to
implement this capability.

MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

1. On Friday, 15 July, in Secretary Sharp's Conference Room, members of this Directorate, AFCIN and SAFLL briefed the following Congressional Committees: the Air Force's UFO program: the Preparedness Sub-Committee of the US Senate, the Science and Astronautics Committee of the House, and the Armed Services Committee of the House.

2. In addition to personnel from each of these Committees and this headquarters, Dr. Hynek of Northwestern University (our civil consultant on UFO's) and Major Friend of ATIC attended this briefing.

3. The Congressional Committees involved wanted reassurance from the Air Force concerning our position on unidentified flying objects because they have received a great deal of pressure from constituents advocating public hearings on this subject.

4. All personnel attending the briefing were pleased with the results and the general concensus is that no public hearings will be held in the near future.

5. However, this meeting and the informal discussions which followed revealed the fact that ATIC (Major Friend's office) must have immediate mobility to investigate specific UFO sightings which generate instantaneous press, public and congressional interest. Major Friend and ATIC will, of course, involve TDY funds so TDY funds and other investigative personnel to visit the scene of a specific sighting and could, I am told, involve the assignment of additional personnel to Major Friend's office. Major, SAFLY, Dr. Hynek and AFCIN-P-1a all concur in this need for immediate mobility in investigating certain specific sightings.

6. Therefore request your office support this recommendation and action be taken as soon as possible to implement this requirement.

ATIC Capability for Investigating Citings of
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

17 AUG 1960

AFCIN-P

1. During the week of 11-15 July 1960, meetings were held at Department
of Defense (SAFOIL-34), SAFIL, and AFCIN-PIA) concerning the status of the Air
Force program for investigating and reporting on Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena. During the course of these meetings, briefings were given to
staff members of the Senate and House Committees concerned with this
problem.

2. At a briefing on 13 July 1960, Mr. Stuart French of the Senate
Committee on Preparedness pointed out that ATIC should have a capability
to investigate those cases which give an indication of having a high
intelligence or scientific potential, and also, those which generate an
unusual amount of public interest. During the course of a joint brief-
ing of members of the House Armed Services Committee, the House Sciences
and Aeronautics Committee, CIA, and Office of Secretary of the Air
Force on 15 July 1960, Mr. Robert Smart of the Armed Services Committee
stated that the investigative capability of Air Force Bases, as currently
provided, is limited to routine cases. He further stated that the Air
Force should have both the numbers and capability to conduct the UFO
operation. This was taken to mean that the Aerial Phenomena Group of
ATIC should investigate outstanding cases. An indication of the high
priority assigned is the fact that for an interim period, financing of
travel in connection with this program was authorized to be made directly
from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.

3. This additional function is estimated to involve 12 to 15 cases each
year requiring investigation and subsequent reporting. This represents
an outlay of resources not originally programmed and not within the pre-
sent capability of the Aerial Phenomena Group of ATIC, which is currently
staffed with one commissioned officer and one non-commissioned officer.
Performance of the function properly would necessitate the assignment of
an additional officer and would cost approximately $3,000 in travel funds.

4. It is requested that the additional personnel and funds be authorized.
This request is being routed to AFCIN-P, since the representative at the
meetings, Lt. Colonel Sullivan, expressed a willingness to coordinate in
securing the additional resources necessary. The officer selected for the

- page 21 -

Memo, AFCIN-M5, ATIC Capability for Investigating Citings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

assignment should be a rated officer and have a scientific background (preferably physics or astronomy). The combined experiences and talents represented by an officer possessing these qualifications would be beneficial to this group in the Investigative and analysis phases.
