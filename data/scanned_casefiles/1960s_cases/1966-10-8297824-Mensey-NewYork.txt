11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted football shaped that was traveling toward the north. Suddenly it turned Northeast, gathered speed and was climbing swiftly, as it was turning two to eleven seconds to come together to form one. It suddenly hit this white object, at impact there was a white flash, the football shaped object shook and shuddered then it went upwards very rapidly.

Observers have seen UFOs on other occasions. They appear to be prejudiced against accepting any explanation as to what they saw. The available information is consistent with that of an aircraft observation.

There are numerous air routes and airports around the area.

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:

I talked to Mrs for 15-20 minutes on the telephone. She would offer no more information than is presented in Mr. letter. There is no physical evidence with which to conduct an investigation.

I offered Mrs several possible explanations of what she and her husband saw. They are both UFO enthusiasts and feel they saw something unusual. However, there are numerous air routes and airports around the area. The overwhelming amount of evidence available would point to aircraft in flight. Especially so in view of the strong inversion layer in the area of the observation.

WILLIAM J. ARCHIBALD, CAPTAIN, USAF
Investigating Officer

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs:
None.
