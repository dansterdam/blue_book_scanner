Mrs. Frances,
Your attention is called to the information contained in report 8297747 concerning a UFO sighting near Fairborn, Ohio, on 8 August 1961.
According to the report, two observers sighted an object which appeared to be triangular in shape, hovering at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet.
Bearings : 110° ± 5°
Elevation : 19° ± 5°
(Alt.: over 70°)
The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes, during which time it moved slowly, then gradually accelerated and disappeared over the horizon.
This sighting is considered to be possibly of significant interest and warrants further investigation.

The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather two sketches or illustrations related to a UFO sighting report.

The first sketch shows a curved line with instructions to "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second sketch contains a larger landscape illustration with two smaller illustrations. The larger illustration shows a road or path with buildings and trees in the background. The smaller illustration on the left shows a person standing on the path, while the smaller illustration on the right shows a more distant landscape view.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

At about 2027 EST, on Aug 31, 1 observed a moving light in the sky. The light was moving from east to west. It was brighter than the moon and appeared to fluctuate in intensity. The light seemed to be oval in shape and apparently had a tail or wake behind it. The light was observed for about 10-15 seconds and then disappeared (passed behind trees). I called a friend to observe the light but he was unable to see it. 2 sketches (attached) show what I saw.

Description of object:
- Moving light
- Brighter than moon
- Fluctuating intensity 
- Oval shape
- Apparent tail or wake
- Observed for 10-15 seconds
- Disappeared behind trees

E.g.: If this is intended as a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object, this is a valid summary of the key observations about the shape, movement, and disappearance of the light object reported.

While 190 feet up in a tower located on an airforce range near [redacted], Ohio, observer notice a bright light coming towards him to the east which was about 500 feet off the ground and passed overhead in a westerly direction. The light was reported as a brilliant star-like object and approached at a high rate of speed, then passed directly over the observer at an estimated distance of 300 to 400 yards above the ground. The object was sighted for approximately 30 seconds and it continued its westerly course at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
