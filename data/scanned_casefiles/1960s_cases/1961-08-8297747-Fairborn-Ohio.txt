Was observed to N at a fairly high elev, having S. Description is characterized as a "rather balloon". Balloons are launched just E for miles NE of Fairborn, and prevailing winds would carry 1 to the E. These balloons are launched at approx time of sighting. Therefore concluded that object was probably a balloon.

Maj. Frisell:

If you the questionnaire to Capt. Harland. He will have it for me tomorrow (Rts of big today).

Revised figures for point of diagonals: harder some what at noon:

against: 110° ± 8°
elevation: 14° ± 5°

(B..: now about 75° of arc rather than 70°)

The use of a transit would make 1/2 to too much tape due to their uncertainty: most of point of diagonals (Rts) (Held) would still have uncertain in ± 5 ring.

[There is also a small black silhouette of what appears to be a bird or animal at the bottom of the page.]

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: 31 AUG 1961

At about 2027 EST, 30 AUG 61 I observed a moving object. My first sight of it was at a point on my meridian about 5° north of the zenith. It traveled at a uniform angular velocity and passed below my horizon (limited by a house). Disk track was about 100° true and angular length of observation about 70°. Length of time in view was about 2 minutes (± 30sec). I checked time as about 2030 EST shortly after it passed out of view.
