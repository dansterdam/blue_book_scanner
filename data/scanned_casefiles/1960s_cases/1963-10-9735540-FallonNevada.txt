H. JUPITER - THIS PLANET CURRENTLY RISES ON THE EASTERN
HORIZON AT THE APPROXIMATE TIME OBSERVED REPORT SEEING THE
UFO, WAS A MAGNITUDE OF MINUS 2.5 AND IS VISIBLE DURING DAYLIGHT.
SATELLITE - A SATELLITE WAS OBSERVED PASSING OVER THIS AREA AT AN
EARLIER DATE, 1 OCTOBER 1963 BY THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER AND A
1.0 COLOR, 3 FT THIS PHASE.
L. A FLIGHT OF FOUR NAVY A1'S WERE OPERATING IN THE AREA
AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ONE AIRCRAFT RETURNING EARLY WAS
ADVISED BY THE TOWER TO USE CAUTION DUE TO THE SIGHTING. THE
PILOT, LT. W. SPEAR, 55-7538, STATES THAT HE OBSERVED AN
EARLY STAR, REPORTED IT AS VENUS, AND DID NOT CONCERN HIMSELF

FURTHER. WHEN THE REMAINING AIRCRAFT RETURNED TO THE FIELD,
THE LEAD AIRCRAFT DID PURSUE THE LIGHT FOR A SHORT TIME, AND THE
PILOT, LT COMMANDER CHARLES G. HARDEN, 569862, THEN
DECIDED THAT THE LIGHT WAS A PLANET, VENUS, AND ALSO RETURNED
TO THE BASE. BOTH AIRCRAFT AND CREWS ARE ASSIGNED TO THE V.A.
SQ ATTACK SQUADRON, NAS FALLON, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,
AND ARE TOY TO FALLON NAS, FALLON, NEVADA.
J. NO KNOWN WEATHER OR RESEARCH FALLONS WERE IN THE
AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM
THE AEROSPACE RESEARCH OFFICE, CHICO, CALIFORNIA
K. MAJOR DONALD E POST, DIRECTOR OF SAFETY, STEAD AFB,
NEVADA, NO OTHER REPORTS OF THIS OBJECT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.
AT THE ONSET THE ORIGINAL WITNESS DID, ALERT THE RADAR SITES AT
TONOPAH, FALLON AND WINNEMUCCA, NEVADA. OBSERVERS AT THESE
SITES CONFIRMED TO THE EXISTENCE OF A LIGHT IN THE SKY ON THE EASTERN
HORIZON. THIS SAME LIGHT WAS REPORTED ON THE FOLLOWING TWO
NIGHTS AND WAS OBSERVED TO BE A STAR, NOT A STAR. IT IS
THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED
WAS THE PLANET JUPITER, THAT THE PRESENCE OF AN CLOUD LAYER
AT ALTITUDE PROVIDED THE ILLUSION OF APPARENT MOTION AND CONFUSED
