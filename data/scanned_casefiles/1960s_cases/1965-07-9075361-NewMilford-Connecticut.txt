Dear Sirs:

On July 3, about seven-thirty P.M., myself, my daughter and son-in-law were out this unusual night. Rising slowly from southern horizon (probably along the Connecticut) a top-shaped, brightly lighted object, at least twice as large as a plane. I thought we were watching early fireworks. My son went to look a bit, as the object slid and seemed to move. My daughter and I watched it for another 15 min. and slightly it was getting higher and higher, scaled my son back out to the lot to building, quickly, yellow, red as if got close. I thought close, but over the end of our field - directly behind the object - with a jet stream - relative to it. I'll tell you briefly what might surprise you.

Sincerely,
[signature blacked out]
