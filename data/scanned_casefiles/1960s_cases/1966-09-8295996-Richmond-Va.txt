The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an unclassified document from the Department of the Air Force discussing a space experiment that ejected a barium and copper oxide payload from a four-stage rocket fired from Wallops Island, Virginia. The document describes the creation of a huge multi-colored cloud which covered hundreds of miles of the sky and was visible at high altitudes for about 45 minutes. The document also mentions that the object sighted was believed to be the NASA-created cloud and that the swirling motion observed was caused by the expansion of the cloud, certain maneuvers of which "Captain Maurer believes his sighting was the most logical conclusion is that the observer and his fellow officers saw the NASA space cloud which reported was visible from widely scattered areas of the country."

h. Remarks:
Although this sighting occurred on the 23rd, it was not reported until a few days later. As he did not notify any authorities until then, there is no official record of the incident. He received the call at 2130, 26 Sept. The boys were aged 10 and 15 according to the caller, who thought it was a matter that required a report. After questioning the caller, it was decided that the object was probably an unusual reflection of light, the minimum size estimated as about 30-40 feet across, and the maximum height estimated as above 5000-6000 feet. No photos were taken and no physical evidence of any kind was obtained. The duration was from 10-20 minutes.

CLOUDS TAKE ON COLORS

WALIOPS ISLAND, V». Sept. S.— A rigid inspection, scientific instrumen's appar from the sky and were subjected to. It was the Navy's opinion that the clouds look strangs and varied colors as they developed during the firing of an experimental rocket.
The National Aeronautics and Space AdminiSL/ation at Wallops Island conducted a thorough study of the unusual cloud formations and the strange colors which appeared to result from the experimental firing. A scientific report was prepared at the conclusion of the study, which was made at the request of the Navy's Office of Naval Research.
The report indicates that the sky took on strange and varied colors, with unusual cloud formations, as a result of the experimental firing. It appears that the exhaust of the rocket produced chemical reactions in the cloud formations, resulting in the varied colors. The full scientific report has not been made public at this time.

Strange Object Band

A clear night, and an American on the ground in Virginia related the following: He said he witnessed an object like a baton or band or ribbon which hovered and moved over a field for several minutes. The object was long, cigar-shaped, giving off a bluish light. One man reported it as very high up and others said it was low. It was visible for about ten minutes.

The report stated that the pocket watch of a witness was stopped. It was a very bright light, blue-green in color, and about 50 to 75 feet long. The object made no noise and moved in a straight line. No details of a structural nature were observed. The object appeared to be about 30 feet off the ground and hovered and moved very slowly, sometimes downward slightly, and then back up, maintaining generally the same altitude. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing at a high rate of speed.

GERMAN BARIUM CLOUD EXPERIMENT LAUNCHED AT WALLOPS

A cooperative experiment between the Max Planck Institute of Munich, Germany, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was launched from Wallops Island, Va. at 5:13 a.m. EDT today.

The chemical barium and copper oxide payload was developed by a scientific team headed by Professor H. Lüst, Director of the Max Planck Institute.

The big colored clouds, illuminated by the sun, were visible for hundreds of miles. A similar launch is scheduled for 5:51 a.m. EDT tomorrow morning.

Launched on a four-stage Javelin sounding rocket, the experiment ejected barium clouds at altitudes of about 257 and 570 statute miles. The artificial clouds first appeared as light green tinged with red. As they enlarged, they turned blue and formed elongated patterns, several hundred miles long, along the lines of the earth's magnetic field.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text document with typewritten content. The text appears to be part of a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text states that the experiments are based on an agreement between the Ministry of Scientific Research of the Federal Republic of Germany and NASA. The primary objective is to obtain measurements of electric fields and wind motion in the upper atmosphere by photographing and tracking the movement of ionized barium clouds. Tracking stations are located along the Virginia-North Carolina coast, and the experiments are being conducted.

SECOND BARIUM CLOUD EXPERIMENT
LAUNCHED AT WALLOPS

The second of a series of two barium vapor cloud experiments was conducted at 5:31 a.m. EDT today at Wallops Island, Va.

A cooperative project between the German Ministry of Scientific Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the chemical payloads were developed by scientists of the Max Planck Institute of Munich, Germany.

Today's experiment was launched by a Nike-Tomahawk sounding rocket. Portions of the mixture of barium and copper oxide were ignited and ejected at three separate times during the flight of the rocket-at about 125 miles altitude during ascent and again at 160 miles altitude during descent. The three distinct green-colored clouds were visible for hundreds of miles.

57° and corpulent. 
legs numb and paralyzed,
20 - 25 000 ft elevation.
29.00 High ( Fit 7 800 ft ) This was apparent.

The difference is to have the angle from the object to an apparent and more high altitude and was thought to be but one.

The object: It was similar to attempt and neon light with an interion an exterior green lights. The the object was brilliant and after a tense. I have so intense that the object was much go visible and I have to look away. as that a yellow across B is also it was still visible at times. of apparent size about 25 to 30 yards and moved without a sound. The object appeared to be shaped light-and acted on man-like in motion. I could not not any motor or other visible means of propulsion. It disappeared right quite suddenly and could no locating again.

The object of the investigation is plausible and the carcass that the officer saw, considered in the light of these other circumstances, would suggest that something has been taking place here that is not of a normal character. he is not as yet made over to know that. It is also a matter of how the carcass was exhibited and who saw it. Unfortunately, the report on this incident does not give any indication of this. Although the officer is entitled to his opinion, the evidence at hand is obviously not conclusive, and more detailed information would be required before any definite conclusion could be reached.

29 Sept. 66

Contact was made with Wallops Island (NASA) Virginia (N-24-411) from Project Blue Book. The sighting was reported to have been made at 2200 EST on 26 Sept. 66. It was stated from Wallops that could have been the cause of the sighting.

Contact with Langley AFB, Virginia PIO office - SS-2947. There was no report received to Langley AFB for the sighting on 26 Sept. 66. The PIO office knew of no sonic booms being heard which could have been reported by personnel at the Richmond area.

(757) 327-2355 - contact with the FAA control tower at Richmond (at this unknown time), They were unable to confirm any aircraft activity at the time but advised they were not always aware.

The watch supervisor was asked if he knew of any aircraft being observed in the area for the observation of a doubtful UFO.

30 Sept. 66

Contact was made with the OSI at Richmond Virginia (649-4611) ex of Richmond PD), who advised FBI advised to be checking into incoming data relating to the sighting(s). Apparently became being reported on their records dealing with an observation of an UFOs.

Contact was made with Capt. Kid'd Langley AFB, Virginia - SS-2352. He did advise that a flight of 4 UFO observe were observed over the Wilcox Area, and it was later that night. The command post had received no call for the sighting.

Contact was made with Dr. Hynek (AF consultant to Project Blue Book) that the sighting sounded very much like a day light met but that such a meteor would have left behind some type of a smoke trail which was not reported in the incoming data. A sun reflection seems highly unlikely since the alleged traveled 57 degrees in the sky in 3-4 seconds.

Echo I was going over the southern United States on a 3E heading from 1600 GMT and would note have been vanguard due to the flight characteristics of a satellite.

30 Sept. 66

The possibilities of a daylight meteor being observed is quite obvious. However, much more research is very bright to have been seen from a point on the ground. A solid body is possible, but in this respect this seems to give the object was observed approximately 5? degrees in the sky in 3-4 seconds. The only explanation is a possible meteor. No definite conclusion can be reached.

3 Oct. 66

Contact was made with the weather bureau Richmond, Va. regarding alleged UFO sighting 9/27-28. There was no indication on their records to account for the UFO sighting. No sonic booms were heard to best the tower personnel could remember. Nothing unusual was seen or heard.
