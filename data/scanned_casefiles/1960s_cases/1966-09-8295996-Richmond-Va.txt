35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I a - not believe the object in question to have been a flying saucer. It was as discribed, more like a balloon. About noon on the following day, sometime, I heard on the radio that an experiments missile had been fired in the Washington D.C. area to be released as a chemical cloud. The data about was about the same as the object I had sighted, as was the position. It was possibly it was in this general cloud I had sighted, as well as other such information, as reliable as this is, cannot conclusively prove or disprove the experiment.

The weather as bid just been reported on the radio at the time was: temp. 63° wind- calm  smoky ground fog in low-lying areas.

The object was circular at first sighting, and growing in diameter as it was sighted. Then it changed shapes, with a great mass of intensity, to an almost clear form and angle of approx. 30°. It seemed to be the same angular alt.(20°) as the first sighting.

The first report you received is the original one I made as the sighting occurred, and is as accurate as I could make it at the time. I hope I have been of help to somebody. Anything else I can do, let me know.

Sincerely,

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form when your Op report is in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sighting at the same time are received, contact Capt. Gately or Lt. Lowell. It points are much more easily investigated at the time of the sighting than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AAPR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn to this form with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several persons at one time, such as Capt. Craig, et. Lt. Campbell, report a more easily investigated sighting. Your cooperation at the time of the sighting, that a way or two these sightings in a professional manner will help the Air Force investigate.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. It started out as a haze about the size of a moon's halo; then it suddenly got bigger and bigger and finally faded out slowly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: ______

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: Not really moved. It appeared in front of some stars. (you could still see the stars)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: like a buzz, some (very faint)
b. Color: bluish-gray

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Very little. Maybe just the very center.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

A SPACE EXPERIMENT WHICH EJECTED A BARIUM AND COPPER OXIDE PAYLOAD
FROM A FOUR-STAGE-ROCKET FIRED FROM ITS TEST RANGE AT WALLOPS ISLAND,
VIRGINIA. THE SPACE EXPERIMENT CREATED A HUGE MULTI-COLORED CLOUD
WHICH COVERED HUNDREDS OF MILES OF THE SKY AND WAS VISIBLE AT HEIGHTS
310 TO 570 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES, SETTING OFF
PAGE 4 RUNG-U 2465 UNCLAS

A SERIES OF UFO REPORTS. UPON LEARNING OF THE SPACE EXPERIMENT,
MAJOR BUNCE ADVISED THAT HE BELIEVES THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS THE NASA-
CREATED CLOUD AND THAT THE SWIRLING MOTION HE OBSERVED WAS CAUSED
BY THE EXPANSION OF THE CLOUD. CAPTAIN MAURER BELIEVES HIS SIGHTING
ALSO WAS THE CLOUD. ON THE BASIS OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE
MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THAT THE OBSERVER AND HIS FELLOW OFFICERS
SAW THE NASA SPACE CLOUD WHICH REPORTED WAS VISIBLE FROM WIDELY
SCATTERED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH THIS SIGHTING WAS ORIGIN-
ALLY DESCRIBED AS COMET-LIKE, A COMET PROBABLY WOULD NO HAVE BEEN
VISIBLE FOR SO LONG A PERIOD. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE SUITABLE FOR
THE OBSERVATIONS REPORTED AND IN THE ABSENCE OF REPORTS ON ANY
OTHER PHENOMENA, THE SPACE CLOUD IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE
OBJECT SIGHTED. 14L1 NONE.

TO:     AFSC (FWD)
        Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1.     The two UFO reports attached are submitted for your information.

2.     Reference the report on the completed work sheet. This report is
        actually, Incl 3 days old before I received it.

3.     Reference the hand-printed report, I could not make out enough
        information from this report to complete a work sheet so I am sending
        the report I received directly to you. On this report, a woman in a
        town or service main warned orally that she made me sighting and reported
        it to Lt Col Addey, who was PAAAS at Louisiana, may at Huston, La. Colonel
        Addey added his own comments. Captain Casey, whose name and address
        appear in the upper right corner is also a PAAAS at the school and
        he referred the report off 2nd Lt Casey to verify. I was to be credible
        to Lt. The 2nd DI called me late yesterday afternoon to forward the
        reports to me.

4.     Because both reports were so long being received, I was unable
        to get much exact information for corroboration. However, I would like
        to point out the similarity of the tales on both reports. As noted on
        the first report, etc., an UON noting, no re, car. As a matter-of-fact,
        they were called by the inform, the newspaper to inquire about the same
        information. Apparently, the local newspaper is as well as the
        AFWON unit.

h. Remarks
Although this sighting occurred on the 23rd, I was not notified until the evening
of the 25th by the bureau boy's mother. She did not, by her own admission,
have all the facts straight so I asked her to have her son call me when he had the
chance. I received this call at 2130, 26 Sept. The boys were at a local Football
stadium "guarding" a concession which had been set up the night before to be
ready for a game the night of the 23rd. A phone call to UAC and a subsequent
survey of their logs does not show any activity in that area at that time.
Although I have no official weather data, the sky was clear at midnight and
also at 0700 (my personal observations) and the minimum temperature that night
was 64 degrees.

Contact with Wallops Island, Va. (NASA) regarding the barium cloud releases on 24 and 25 Sept.
There were suppose to be launches beginning on 7 Sept 66 after dusk; however, various problems arose and they had to postpone. The launch window ran out on the dark shots and they had to consider another date.

On 24 Sept.66 at 0h13 EST there was a launch. There were two cloud releases one at 310 miles and the other at 570 miles. The clouds should have been visible for up to one hour.

On 25 Sept. 66 at 0451 EST there was another launch. There were three cloud releases. Ascending the rocket released a cloud at 125 miles, and 160 miles. Descending the rocket released a cloud at 160 miles.

Contact was made with Mr. [redacted] ex-579-584. A news release will be forwarded to Blue Book for our retention.

The cloud releases would have been visible for up to approximately 2200 miles.

Different Parts of News
Located Sighted Gas
By DAVID LYON Daily News, Warren County Bureau

LEBANON, Sept. 21 - Two Lebanon policemen say there's
no explanation for the Air Force to explain the "unidentified flying
object" they spotted at about 4:30 a.m. today.

Patrolman James D. Snyder and dispatcher Steve Anderson
said they can identify it. They theorize that the
"object" could cover a wide area, consisted of a haze
luminous appearance, which shows up under certain
atmospheric conditions.

Snyder was on patrol when he saw the stationary object
high above the ground, the luminous object had a silver-
like appearance, a part of the city skyline was altered.

Snyder said he was sure of his car just to make sure he
really was seeing what he was seeing.

He followed that road at headquarters, and the dispatcher
also watched the object. The haze, or fog-like appearance
was seen by both. "I don't know what it was," Snyder said.
"Nor do I know what we looked at it." Anderson said.

Meanwhile, the Lebanon department received to
started hearing with reports that the object had been seen
in Greene County (as a matter of fact in Bellbrook and
and 5 other). Said. The Lebanon department received to
date four such reports.

"It was no UFO," was a report it was unexplained,
said a Lebanon police official who asked not to be named.

Recalling his theory, Anderson said the haze becomes
visible when warm air lies in a warm layer under cover
air from below. This document colors were this that red. The
city is up to almost 600 feet, whereas Snyder in Greene
County observers saw it as a red-ish light, Anderson said.

GERMAN BARIUM CLOUD
EXPERIMENT LAUNCHED AT WALLOPS

A cooperative experiment between the Max Planck Institute of Munich, Germany, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was launched from Wallops Island, Va., at 5:13 a.m. EDT today.

The chemical barium and copper oxide payload was developed by a scientific team headed by Professor Reimar Luest, Director of the Max Planck Institute.

The big colored clouds, illuminated by the sun's rays, were visible for hundreds of miles. A similar launch is scheduled for 5:51 a.m. EDT tomorrow morning.

Launched on a four-stage Javelin sounding rocket, today's experiment ejected barium clouds at altitudes of about 310 and 570 statute miles. The artificial clouds first appeared light green tinged with red. As they enlarged, the clouds turned blue and formed elongated patterns, several hundred miles long, along the lines of the earth's magnetic field.

The experiments are based on an agreement between the
Ministry of Scientific Research of the Federal Republic of

measurements of electric fields and wind motion in the
upper atmosphere by photographing and tracking the movement
of ionized barium clouds. Tracking stations are located
along the Virginia-North Carolina coast and in Bermuda.

SECOND BARIUM CLOUD EXPERIMENT
LAUNCHED AT WALLOPS

The second of a series of two barium vapor cloud experiments was conducted at 5:51 a.m. EDT today at Wallops Island, Va.

A cooperative project between the German Ministry of Scientific Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the chemical payloads were developed by scientists of the Max Planck Institute of Munich, Germany.

Today's experiment was launched by a Nike-Tomahawk sounding rocket. Portions of the mixture of barium and copper oxide were ignited and ejected at three separate times during the flight of the rocket--at about 125 and 160 miles altitude during ascent and again at 160 miles altitude during descent. The three distinct green-red-blue clouds were visible for hundreds of miles.

The artificial clouds were photographed and tracked from several sites along the East Coast and in Bermuda. Purpose of the experiments is to measure electric fields and wind motion in the upper atmosphere.

The first of the two experiments was launched from Wallops Island at 5:13 a.m. EDT yesterday. Ralph D. Welsh was the Project Engineer for Wallops Station.

24 Sept. 66
Richmond, Va.

On Saturday September 24th, 1966 at about 1600 (15 minutes) E.D.T. as I lay upon my back on the lawn of my home at 511 St. Christopher Road in Richmond, Virginia I observed an object move across the open sky space above me from West to East on a course slightly North of 090°.

I observed this object for about 3 to 4 seconds until it became obscure by a tree. Although I jumped to my feet and attempted to move closer from the tree that obscured it I was not able to see it again.

The Object: It was impossible to estimate its size and therefore impossible to estimate its altitude. I had the impression that the object was quite high. It was small, difficult, or nothing. I have observed it almost directly overhead so that a plane view of it was all I could observe. It appeared to be round and without any discernible projection or nothing. Against a deep blue sky it appeared light - in tone such blue color in color, but not of anything. Instead its color was similar to & less of unplated silver.

Congressman from Richmond Virginia watched a silver bright flat object travel above an arc of 57 degrees in several seconds. The object was observed through several trees and disappeared behind some trees after being observed for about 4 seconds. The alleged UFO was traveling toward the east.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I heard a sound, (buzz-saw). I look into the sky and saw a long vapor (blush-gray) like a very wide hose. Then it got larger and larger, but stayed basically in the same place. Then it got huge and started fading away into nothing.

29 Sept. 66

Contact was made with Wallops Island (NASA) Virginia (824-3411 ex.579). Miss Millner in the information office said that she knew of nothing from Wallops that could have been the cause of the sighting. She checked and found that no balloons were launched from Wallops on 24 Sept, 66.

Contact with Langley AFB, Virginia PIO Office ex-2947. There were no UFO reports reported to Langley AFB for 24 Sept. 66. The PIO Office knew of no sonic booms being heard on that particular day. There was nothing on their records to account for the Richmond area sighting.

Contact was made with the FAA control tower, Byrd Field, Richmond, Va. (737-220). There was no observation of any unknown over the Richmond area on the afternoon of 24 Sept. 66. There were no accounts of sonic booms being heard. The watch supervisor was asked if he knew of anything unusual that could have accounted for the observation of a UFO and he replied negative.

30 Sept. 66

Contact was made with the OSI at Richmond Virginia (649-3611 ex 2500). Their office knew of no unusual observations being made in the Richmond area. They had no accounts of any sonic booms being heard. There was nothing on their records dealing with an observation of any UFOs over the Richmond area, for the date in question.

Contact was made with Capt. Kidd Langley AFB, Virginia ex-3252. He said the on the night of 24 Sept. 66 a UFO report was received by the Langley AFB command post; however, the report was from Norfolk, Virginia and was later that night. The command post had received no calls concerning a sighting from the Richmond area in the afternoon of the 24 Sept. 66.

Contact was made with Dr. Hynek (AF consultant to Project Blue Book). He said that the sighting sounded very much like a daylight meteor but that such a meteor would have left behind some type of a smoke trail. He did not believe a balloon responsible for the sighting. If the alleged UFO was a meteor if should have left behind some type of trail. From the given data a sun reflection seems highly unlikely since the alleged UFO traveled 57 degrees in the sky in 3-4 seconds.

Echo I was going over the southern United States on a SE heading at the 1620 EDT, but would not have been visible due to the light conditions. The sun had not set making the observation of a satellite quite impossible.

30 Sept. 66

The possibilities of a daylight meteor being observed is quite possible. 
Although a meteor must have been very bright to have been observed 
and some type of a smoke trail should have been present. A sun reflection 
from a solid body is possible, but in this respect this seems unlikely 
since the object was to have traveled approximately 57 degrees across 
the sky in 3-4 seconds. The only explanation is a possible daylight 
meteor; however, no definite conclusion can be reached.

3 Oct. 66

Contact was made with the weather bureau Richmond, Va. regarding 
the alleged UFO sighting (737-121). There were no balloons launched 
in the late afternoon of 24 Sept. 66. There was nothing unusual noted 
to account for the UFO sighting. No sonic booms were heard to the 
best the lower personnel could remember. Nothing unusual was 
observed.

ATTN: Colonel C. S. Allman
Bolling AFB DC 20332

1. The attached material was forwarded to SAFOI by SAFIL. Following this we asked Major Quintanilla to check the reports. His findings were essentially negative:

a. Wallops Island reported no balloon launches coincidental with the sightings.

b. Langley AFB reported no UFOs at that time of day, but one that night.

c. FAA at Byrd Field reported no unusual observations.

d. OSI, Richmond reported no unusual observation.

e. All of the above reported no sonic booms at or about the time in question.

f. Echo One was over the Southern U. S. at 1620 KST but should not have been visible since even at night the magnitude of this body is comparable to stars.

g. Dr. Rynack has pointed out that a daylight meteor is a possibility but should be accompanied by a smoke trail.

h. All the above was passed to Lt Colonel Dave Jones, SAFIL, for his use in replying to the congressman.

2. Colonel Jones has asked that someone in the local area who is familiar with Project Blue Book reports and procedures, someone capable
