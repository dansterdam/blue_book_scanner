Re: 10/Sept/68, Las Vegas Case
4 Witnesses

Las Vegas, Nev. 89107
701/878-1211

It is possible that one person thought one star was moving among others. One would have to ask witness whether she actually saw the object move with respect to the stars.

Report states object was moving west at a constant rate of speed, and that when it reached a position directly overhead, forward motion ceased and a pendulum motion was observed.

Furthermore, Nellis Air Force Base personnel also observed the object (supposedly). Also, North Las Vegas airport observed the object (supposedly) same object, but, of course, not established west of their location at an estimated height of 5000 feet. Radar did not pick up. Therefore, I cannot agree that it was likely that a star was the stimulus for this report. To say so means that we have to discount completely:

1. Observed motion of object.

2. Its pendulum motion (were other stars also moving like a pendulum?)

3. Evidence of other observers, presumably experienced, at Nellis AFB and at airport.

Cause of report in my opinion must remain "unidentified" until, if and when, proper follow-up is made to seek observers to trace motion of object among the stars. I will attempt to do so if authorized. Actually, authorization is implied in Article 1, Paragraph 4"to analyze and evaluate reports of un-identified aerial phenomenon for the purpose of determining the cause."

8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
