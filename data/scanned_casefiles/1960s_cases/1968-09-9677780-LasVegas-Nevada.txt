Re: 10/Sept/68, Las Vegas Case
4 Witnesses
Las Vegas, Nev. 89107
701/878-1211

It is possible that one person thought one star was moving among others. One would have to ask witness whether she actually saw the object move with respect to the stars.

The moving object was merely a star at a constant rate of speed that when it reached a position directly overhead, forward motion ceased and a pendulum motion was observed.

Furthermore, Nellis Air Force Base personnel also observed the object (supposedly). Also, North Las Vegas Airport observed the object (supposedly) but of course, not established what was observed.

1. Observed motion of object.
2. Its pendulum motion (were other stars also moving like a pendulum?)
3. Evidence of other observers, presumably experienced, at Nellis AFB

Cause of report in my opinion must remain "unidentified" until, if and when, the object disappears from view, I will attempt to do so if authorized. Actually, authorization is implied in Article 1, Paragraph 4(c) to analyze and evaluate reports of unidentified aerial phenomena for the purpose of determining the cause.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram showing the elevation angle of an observed unidentified phenomenon. The diagram is accompanied by a questionnaire titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" that collects various details about the sighting, including the time, location, and observer's descriptions.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.

The image contains a photograph depicting a compass with directions and two illustrations showing a person standing in a landscape with a distant horizon. The text at the bottom of the image indicates this is "Page 2 of 9 pages".

DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, "PLACE AT "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENOM WHEN LAST SEEN."
PHENOMENON WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD
TO BE SET ALL 8 POINTS OF THE COMPASS, CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN SEEING. THEN ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DATA, SUCH AS DIRECTION AND APPROXIMATE SIZE, THAT WOULD SATISFACTORILY SHOW WHAT THE OBSERVER SAW. UTILIZE THE LARGER SKETCH.
