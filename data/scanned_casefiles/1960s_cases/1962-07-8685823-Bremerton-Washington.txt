REPLY TO
ATTN OF: FMCIO/5639                                                                14 NOV 1962

SUBJECT:  Release of Information on UFOs

TO:       25 Air Div (25CIO)

1. In accordance with par 7, AFR 200-2, 20 Jul 62, the attached correspondence is forwarded for information and action.

2. On the night of 23 July 1962 a number of calls were received from civilian sources reporting a "lighted object" in the vicinity of Bremerton, Wash. Soon after these calls were received from these civilian sources, a pilot of a McChord aircraft who had just landed at McChord also reported an object in the vicinity of Bremerton. This pilot, considered an experienced observer, reported that the object unquestionably in his mind was a shooting star. Additionally, a Civil Air Patrol pilot was reported to have contacted civil flight officials about an object sighted in the same vicinity at the same time and he also thought that it was a shooting star.

3. In view of the above no further investigation was made, nor was report submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2.

4. As for reference to the article in the Seattle Times our records do not reveal any such story and a check with the Seattle Times information desk and morgue confirms that no specific reference to UFOs and McChord jets has been published in that paper during the past year.

Dear [redacted]:

With reference to your letter of October 30, concerning UFO and also referring to an article in the Seattle Times in connection with the UFO incident near Tacoma with directions from Sq USAF, I have forwarded your letter to them. I am sure that you will hear from them in the very near future and perhaps they will provide you with some information on the subject.

As for your reference to reading an article in the Seattle Times concerning our jets making these sightings, neither this office nor the Seattle Times can find such an article. If you recall the exact date and will let me know, I will again make inquiries from that publication.

Thank you for your interest.

Yours truly,

JOSEPH L. MCHUGH, JR.

Commanding Officer
McChord Air Force Base
McChord, Washington

Dear Sir:

I am a sophomore at Ingraham High School, and I am extremely interested in unidentified flying objects (UFO). I have talked with a friend on the subject whose opinion I believe and respect.

I have investigated the subject through books and magazine articles such as Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force by Lawrence J. Tacker with the report on Unidentified Flying Objects by Edward J. Ruppelt written in 1956. Some of these are written by persons in the armed services who personally have witnessed these phenomenon.

I recall reading in the Seattle Times recently that jets from your base made these sightings. I will appreciate your views or opinions as to whether these UFO's could be interplanetary vehicles.

Very truly yours,

[Signature is blacked out]
