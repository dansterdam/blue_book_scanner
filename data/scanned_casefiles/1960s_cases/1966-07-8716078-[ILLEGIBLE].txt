35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Sir:

I know my recent encounter was with an object or craft not of natural origin. I now believe if it had a plane or test craft that it would have not played funny little games with me. This object seemed to be observing me for its own personal interest.

The object can be snugged off as a natural phenomena or a misinterpreted air craft. But this was clearly an object that was intelligently guided and propelled by a power source unknown to our technology.

I would never insult the opinion of your agency, but I know what I saw was no natural happening. The next day - two people in Pleasanton and High Point witnessed U.F.O. similar to the one I saw. I seems highly unlikely that the physical description would not closely correlate with mine, unless the object was of the same origin.

These ships or craft would possibly be interplanetary vehicles visiting us on friendly basis. We would they want to detain us when they are many times more advanced than we.

(Signed)

This of course is only one redemption day more, which
means nothing from your viewpoint!

I would like the summary of my encounter again.

I was standing from Asheville to Troutdale, N.C. I
saw - flying side glance in a wooded area, I stopped
the car to have sit off was a fire. (I the area was
extremely dry) I smelled no smoke no noise, an
eerie thing of fire. I returned to my car and continued
my trip.

I then noticed a strange red glare in my rear
view mirror. I immediately increased my speed to
go then 120 M.P.h. Then came to a full stop
in three to 400 feet. The object stopped and hovered
over my car. I left the car and hid under the
rear part. The object was about 50 feet of the west
100 yds back. The basic structure didn't change
just the arrangement of lights. Still - pulsating and
changing color. The craft wobbled on its axis. It
made a slight turn. It then approached the
car closer to just over my and finally rose and vanished
into the horizon in less than 5 seconds. I was
so frightened I could tell all to tell anyone. I
after was by my place and thought it over. I
still myself no one would believe me so I kept it
quiet except my letter to you.

P.S.
Since you along with my
report and to my comments. If it
is possible. Thanks again.

Dear Sir:

On the night of July 24, 1966 a strange an unexeplained event happened to me. While driving between Greenville and Vanscboro, N.C. I encountered a large glowing dark-shaped object on vehicle. About six miles east of Greenville I noticed a strange glow coming from a wooded area to my left. The weather has been dry so I thought it might be a forest fire, I stopped my car to check it out. I then was no smell of smoke but the bright glowing orange-red color continued. It was fascinating, but I saw best interest and returned to my car and continue my trip.

Two miles down the road, I saw the same mild, light in my rear view mirror. This scared the hell out of me, so I increased my speed to 90 M.P.H. the glow continued to follow me. This continued for 10 miles; not giving, not losing distance. At one point I was running 120 M.P.H.

the object continued pursuit. (cl slammed on my
brakes and stopped in about 3-400 east. It would
be highly unlikely for any type of convected aircraft
to make such an abrupt stop, even a
helicopter.)

I stopped from my car and hid under the
trunk between the back tires. I was almost
housed about 50 feet over the road about 100 yds.
behind me. I finally I emerged a spot a little
back at the object; it was huge, about 100 feet
in diameter with a dome shape top. The
object slowed color in a pulsating manner, from
orange to red to blue to green. It made no on the
after matter making a sound of any kind.

The object approached my car and came
within 100 feet of me. At this distance I
could at an extremely good look at the craft.
it was spherical with a nearly type of glow
like a neon light behind a magenta net. The
craft emitted no heat no sound what so ever.

The object hovered at close range for about
2 minutes and rose could disappeared among
the stars. The _______ of the object
was roughly the goldtown vanished in

in less than five seconds.

I know all types of crafts, commercial and military. This was no plane, helicopter, satellite, or natural happening of any kind. It was a structural craft defying the laws of gravity. This experience happened about 2:00 A.M. on the morning of the 25th.

I am a geography major at East Carolina College. I have a sound reputation and not only to write something that I actually happen to me. Will you Department please reply to my experience at once.
