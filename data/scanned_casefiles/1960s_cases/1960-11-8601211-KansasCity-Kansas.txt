9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A class unknown object about 100 ft long, black in color, pulsed light, observed moving from north to south. No in point and one object traveled about 1,000 ft behind. Initial observation due to car breakdown. Object very visible with ground visible that travels. Fell appeared to be orange. Stopped at West 68th Street at elevation of about 10 deg. Witness estimated altitude at 1,500, however could be tracker at different. All bearings taken at 6.7 miles. Converging lines in visual flight in general.

10. COMMENTS
Contrails projected the sun and on 9/10 at midnight and changes would appear like this to an untrained observer, particularly one not familiar with sky. The motion is slightly in excess of that expected for an aircraft. Observation, however, was total, including observation of the contrails, and is an example of the possibility.

11. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical

□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

There is no evidence to indicate this was something other than an aircraft of three aircraft, at altitude with contrails.
