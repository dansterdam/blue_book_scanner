SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO:    OP-0

1. The following information was received via telephone from Col Arnold (OSI) at 1030, 28 Aug 62:

    a. Col Arnold received a telephone call from a USMC Recruiting Service, Old Customs House, Aurora, phone reporting the following facts as he saw them:

    (1) "At 1845, 26 Aug 62, just after sunset in Del Mar Park an object was sighted in the sky, before Venus had risen and too early for stars to appear. The object was much larger than a commercial jet-about twice the size of a DC-8. The object approached from the West over the mountains in an easterly direction. The object was golden in color, much brighter than the rest of the sky and 3 to 4 times brighter than Venus. The core of the object was golden-yet darker than the rest of the object-more like a golden gray. The object was not the shape of a cigar or submarine nor oval like an egg, but was a shape between those two. The object travelled at terrific speed from over the mountains to the Park (West to East). As it approached the park it appeared to be a finger width above the horizon, (as viewed with fingers held to eye). The object made a high speed turn which was a perfect right angle and headed South for a short distance, (the distance as viewed between 2 Leghorn poles). The object then made another right angle turn very abruptly and went straight up. The object appeared to start a backward roll as some planes do when bombing. At this time the object was lost from sight. This viewing occurred during a sprain of only seconds. The brightness of the object did not increase nor diminish during the course of the maneuvers."

    b. Capt [REDACTED] stated he had not been drinking, nor had he read the recent book on flying saucers.
