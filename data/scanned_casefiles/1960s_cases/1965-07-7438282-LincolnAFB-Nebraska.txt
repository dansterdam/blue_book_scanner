(3) None.

(4) 12 miles.

(5) 2/10.

(6) None.

(7) (Valid at 25/0300Z) Average, surface to 30,000 feet, 2 degrees C per 1000 feet. Temperature inversion from 5,000 feet to 8,000 feet. This information was extracted from Omaha, Nebraska, sounding.

a. Any other unusual activity.

One of "Echo" satellites passing base to southwest at approximately the same time. The first UFO was sighted prior to "Echo" and both lights had disappeared approximately one to two minutes prior to "Echo's" con-placed passage. UFOs were traveling three to four times as fast as "Echo".

i. Unknown.

j. None known.

k. Colonel [redacted], one of the observers, considers the objects were most likely tumbling sections of a spent missile in orbit reflecting sunlight at certain angles. A closer orbit to the earth would account for the greater speed in comparison with "Echo".

1. None.
