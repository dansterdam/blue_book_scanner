Unidentified flying object sighting was reported
34. Approximately 9:20 P.M.,  9 Feb 1967.
35. On the scene I arrived, I could see 2 reddish-orange lights, hovering, pulsating, and maneuvering. The lights were at about 1,000 feet altitude, and were approximately 2 miles from the observers. The lights were observed for about 5 minutes.
36. The lights pulsated and maneuvered in an erratic manner, not like any known aircraft. They appeared to accelerate rapidly and then hover motionless.
37. There were several observers who also saw the lights, and I interviewed them. Their descriptions corroborated my own observations.
38. I could not identify the objects as any known aircraft or other explainable phenomena.
39. The sighting was reported to the Tactical Air Command (TAC) and notification was made to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).
