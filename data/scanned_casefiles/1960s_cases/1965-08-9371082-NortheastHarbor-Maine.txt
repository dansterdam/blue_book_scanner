Dear Field

Please File
Sun 21 65

Air Force Intelligence Section,

I will & just flying object

On a very clear night last Summer
at Northeast Harbor Maine where I came
Cmpl. logged me a night auditor at the
Boothbay Inn a summer resort at
owned by the Delano Corp. of North
east Harbor (Maine). I observed a
unidentified flying object shortly
after the prob. nitely of the Jackson
Cancer Experimental Laboratories
below Bar Harbor.

It was August 29 1966
at approx. nitely 9:15 to 9:30 PM
ask the night clerk in Northeast
Harbor that I was the same
Clarke, at Boothbay at the Boothbay
Institute Stoke Passage Convent
onto of Boothay (Maine) - suddenly
spotted what few appear at to be
low "Observation B Lamp" moving very
slowly, but emitting a "Red Glow"
while light shifted up and off
"in some regulated sequence". Highly
nitely morning from the direction
of Bangor (Maine) apparently with
the sun crossing at approx. nitely
150 feet height - to my way of thinking
Harbor and Bar Harbor, Maine.

As I was Summer at approx. nitely
at my same point of observation just

Then at actually heated fine milk-sac
and its midway stationary -

just apparently shape with me
in total have later determined to me
the proximity of the Jackson
Ponds. By previous to that said
located on the east shore of Beal
Harbor, with 350 to 1500 ft on
the side of just peak there...
as Henly ea. mentioned, perhaps
for a red shaft time I was on
a hill separates me in the sweep
fire to up minute later, the
UFO suddenly sped off at a
breath, neck, rate of speed - put
to sea - only to return after
minutes later to hover motion-
less over the same spot (the
Jackson Lake) and take off a
beyond, time at was could spot
of features, 700 and 1300 miles
off my home - but the sea again.

The Thea Signe it seemed to
hope give that exact same spot
the Jackson Laboratories - it under-
ly ground 1/2 through - being on
the mainland, having Mount
Desert Island at a slant, both off
speed, in fact almost no slow
down as nearing upward west of
westerly perhaps of flight, something
was found - and flashing - only held
and while lights at take off.

My own Judgment Testified... for what they are worth. Estimate these numbers close to F.C. sightings, particularly on this that England areas of dark figures strongly suggest - show if space itself being pulled at attention to strong pen points of intensified electrical and electronic radars. Stations placed bases, apparent mental laboratories, etc. Also hide-out phase... principally located in scattered areas off our country, but strategically located near eye big picture and the lines (see & below) also notably enough for isolation areas, precisely to radiate, but adjacent to some agile white receiving and abandoning its usual moves.

The N.S. H.S. force (to be expected) and will support possible attempts to lift these fallen damage to - test and try sweeping into our atmosphere. But as far as yet - have determined pole attempts thus far - with failure.

Sir in matter now only seen off my note herewith experience to last August 29 and attention to life 2 (illegible)

Diligently yours, (signature partially obscured)
