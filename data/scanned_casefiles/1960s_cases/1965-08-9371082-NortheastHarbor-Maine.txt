Sighting at Northeast Harbor, Iaine on August 9, 1965

On August 9, 1965 at about 7:00 PM, Mr. r as sitting near the entrance of his home when he noticed a bright light in the northern sky. The light appeared to be stationary and shining with a blue-white color. This light gradually increased in intensity and also seemed to grow larger in size.

The light remained stationary for about 2 minutes, then it began to move in a straight line, going from north to south at a rather rapid rate, estimated to be about 1,000 mph. As it moved, the light continued to increase in intensity and size. When it reached a point directly overhead, the light seemed to explode or burst, sending out rays of light in all directions. It then diminished in size and intensity as it continued moving to the south, finally disappearing from sight.

The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. The object displayed no sound or trail and seemed to be under intelligent control. Mr. r described the phenomenon as definitely not an airplane, helicopter, satellite, or other known object. He was unable to determine the actual size or altitude of the object, but estimated that it was quite large and at a very high altitude.

Please advise if any further information is required.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

"The de detaily he i8ty t of the observed orvects as ithey appeared to the observer.

The object first came into the witness field of vision appearing to cone straight up from behind a hill or rise some distance away. It hovered Just ibove the treetops for a short time, then moved off to the west at what the witness describes as a very high rate of speed. Its shape was described as being round or eliptical and its color as white or light gray. No other details of its appearance were noted.

The witness, who is a resident of Northeast Harbor, Maine, reports that he was standing on the porch of his home at approximately 10 PM on the evening of August 9, 1965, when he first observed the object. He stated that he watched it for only a matter of seconds before it disappeared from sight. The weather at the time was reported as clear and the sky was free of clouds.

Subsequent investigation by this office has failed to disclose any known aircraft or astronomical phenomena which could lave accounted for the sighting. The witness is considered to be a reliable and sincere observer."

Dear Mr. Hynek

Incident Report - Sighting

According to telephone conversation with your office, Ranger, Maine National Park Service, here is the report on the sighting as witnessed by me.

At a very clear night, about 10:30 P.M., in the vicinity of the Northeast Harbor, Maine, I was driving along a road when I noticed a very bright light, much brighter than a star, approaching from the northwest at a high rate of speed, estimated at over 1,000 miles per hour. The light was bluish-white in color, spherical in shape and about 2 feet in diameter. It passed overhead at an elevation of approximately 300 feet. When it reached a point directly overhead, the light suddenly went out and I saw nothing further. The whole sighting lasted less than 5 seconds. 

I reported this incident immediately to the nearest park ranger station. Several other people reportedly saw the same object at about the same time, from other locations in the area. I am quite certain it was not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object. This sighting appears to be one of several which have been reported from this general vicinity on various occasions.

I trust this report will be of interest to you and your staff. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)

There is no photograph present in this scanned document from Project Blue Book. The image appears to show handwritten text on a page.

Transcribed text from the document:

The object was approximately 20 feet in diameter, egg-shaped and slightly raised in the middle. It appeared to be surrounded by a soft white glow. The object was first sighted at about 10:30 pm and was visible for approximately 30 minutes. It was observed moving slowly at first, then seemed to accelerate rapidly and disappear from view to the northwest. Two independent witnesses reported the sighting. The weather was clear and the sky was filled with stars.

Jackson (aster) and I observed the object together for about 20 minutes. We were camping in the woods near Northeast Harbor, Maine. The object appeared to be just above the treetops. It was silent and did not seem to be attached to any supporting structure. We were both surprised and puzzled by what we saw. The object appeared to be under intelligent control, but we could not determine its origin or purpose. 

The Air Force was notified of the sighting shortly after it occurred. An investigator was dispatched to interview us, but we were unable to provide any additional details beyond our initial report. The case was classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.
