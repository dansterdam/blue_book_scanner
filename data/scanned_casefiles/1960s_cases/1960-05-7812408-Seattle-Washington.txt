Dear Sirs:

May 6, 1960, I saw my first chance to take "snap shots" of the strange sighting. I purchased a fair of 7x50 binoculars to aide my new contactor in single-shotting 35mm and Pola-color (camera to shots) to enlarge and enhance the image because we hadn't had clear sky since I bought them.

The weather report for that day was: 62-82 Fahrenheit with 15.0 k.t.s light winds at intervals.

I set the camera focus x f infinity) and the right eye piece of the binoculars fully counterclockwise (for greater telescopic range). Then, I put the camera lens right up against the central focus of the binoculars until the object filled my entire range of vision through the binoculars (I had always kept records of the exact focal point, and the elaborate equipment I had always kept records with).

I took four photos that night with Kodak 35mm film. Three were of the moon, and one with binoculars for 1/125th sec. the second was for 1/100th sec. The one of the star was blank, so I discarded it.

The first picture revealed only a fuzzy of the contours/image from the distant object. In the same slide (first frame) also reveals a relatively for image object, almost to the side of the main subject. In the success of colliding, these objects seem to form a sort of "star-speed" and also reveal a relatively less distinct to relatively more distinct gradations of light of the two objects, one being the larger and the other the smaller object relatively.

There is no photograph present in this document. The image appears to be a typed letter or report text.

About "as far away as the moon. The upright frame makes me even more positive that this object is not a man-made one, but in the far lower left of the frame another another object is pictured. This object is much larger, closer or course, but, as I am sure you can see from the exact focusing, it is a completely separate one.

You'll notice too that there are two dots just above the object in frame. Viewing and inspecting the negative under magnification I'm convinced that all of these objects were under 2 dots.

For your convenience, I've included in outline the data and several pictures. I have decided to the negative, since I have no further use for it.

I would deeply appreciate a reply as to the of my findings.

Thankyou.

Yours truly,"

TO: AFCIN-4E2 (Col R. R. SHOOP)

1. Analysis of the negatives and prints reveals that the objects shown are apparently identical to one or three lights similiar to those previously seen with other reports of this nature wherein a lights that mentioned as presenting a strong "blimp" in the central portion. A situation similar to that mentioned in 4 previous report was reconstructed and it was found that by varying the angle of the window through which the photos were taken, the images could be caused to appear and disappear. It is accordingly concluded that the images in the sequence in which they appear, the window would tend to be slightly more for each subsequent exposure.

1. The photographs submitted by Wena of Seattle, Washington, were found to be reflections of stationary lights on a window, and is attempting to pass them off as flying objects. A poor, but determined, attempt to perpetrate a hoax. Any person would recognize the probable circumstances which gave rise to these pictures as definittfied flying objects.
A request was made on 13 July 1960, for an investigation. The investigation was made on 21 July 1960, and all information will be forwarded to ATIC at a later date.

SAFOI-34/1 "Col Tucker,

29 July 1960

Dear [redacted],

With your returning your photographs and negatives submitted with your letter of July 1960 concerning the flying objects, the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has determined that these are definitely pictures of light fixtures reflecting on a window.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects. It plainly states the Air Force's position in regard to this subject.

Sincerely,

SAPER-23 (1/Col Tacker)
1.	The SAPER, the objects reported as alleged UFO's, submitted by Mr. were carefully studied and the objects were determined to be blinking lights, on a window, which is typical of being off as a flying object. The apparent color and characteristics were reported in only general term and gave no light fixtures appearing as unidentified flying objects.
2.	A request was made on 13 July 1960, for an investigation of Bill X X  X.  The investigation was made on 21 July and information will be forwarded to ATC at a later date.
