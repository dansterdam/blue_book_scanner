Dear Sirs:

May 6, 1960, I saw my first chance to take a photo-graph of the moon since my purchase of a pair of Taylor 7x50 binoculars to fit my new contraflex I single lens reflex 55mm camera. The night (time of shooting was between 9:30 PM and 10:00 PM) seemed to be hazy, but, because we hadn't had clear sky since I bought my camera, I tried it anyway.

The weather report for that day was: 62-52 degrees Fahrenheit, and 0.61 inches of rain.

Using the Edmund Scientific Co. binocular-to-camera adapter, I set the camera focus at infinity and twisted the right repiece of the binoculars fully counter-clockwise (for greater telescopic range). Then, to focus the moon, I twisted the central focus wheel on the binoculars until the split image in my rangefinder indicated correct focus.

Since I was beginning to take photos with such elaborate equipment, I had always kept records of each shot.

I took four photos that night with Kodak Tri-X Pan 35mm film; three of which were of the moon, and one of a star. The first was shot at F5.6 (F5.6 lens opening with binoculars) for 1/125th sec., the second was taken at F5.6 for 1/250th sec., the third was taken at F5.6 for 1/60th sec. The one of the star was blank, so we'll forget it.

The first picture revealed only a very fuzzy image of the moon, thus we may remove it from discussion along with frame #4. The second frame shows the moon clearer (finer space) and also reveals 3 positively foreign images in the shape of cigars. These objects seem to be in flying formation, the top one being either the closest or largest, another object is possibly shown at the far right of the second frame. I mean possibly by possibly that it's so small that it could be a scratch or a dust point on the camera lens. I'm certain that the other three were not raised, definitely against the sky, for they don't show up on Frame #1 or #4 and they seem to have the same texture as the moon, that is, they look like they were

about is far away as the moon.
The third frame makes me even more positive. The
moon is blurred (from slow shutter speed and poor focus),
but in the far, lower left of the frame, another object
with the same features is the object in the second
frame is pictured. This object is much larger, or much
closer, than the rest. All of these objects are not in
exact focus, of course, out, as you can see from the
enclosed pictures and negatives, they are more distinguishable
than a bug would be if it were on the lens.
You'll notice, also, two dots just above the large
object in frame #3 and above a few of the others, upon
inspecting the negative under magnification 7 times, I
found that all of these objects were under 2 dots.

For your convenience, I've included an outline of
the data and several pictures. I have decided to include
the negative, since I have no further use for it.

I would deeply appreciate a reply as to the validity
of my findings.

Thank you.

Yours truly,

TO: AFCIN-4E2 (Col R. R. Shoop)

1. Analysis of the negatives and prints reveals that the objects in question are apparently a series of street lights similar to those previously seen with other reports of this nature wherein a light with a shade, reflecting on a window, creates an elliptical shape with a strong white "bump" in the central portion. A situation similar to that mentioned in the report was reconstructed and it was found that by varying the angle of the window through which the photos had to be taken the street lights would appear as seen in the three attached negatives. It might also be stated that to get the images in the sequence in which they appear, the window would have to be opened slightly more for each subsequent exposure.

UFO Reports

SAFOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)

1. The photographs of alleged UFO's, submitted by [redacted] were carefully studied and the objects were determined to be reflections. Deliberately took pictures of light fixtures reflecting on a window, and is attempting to pass this off as flying objects. This was a poor, but determined, attempt to perpetrate a hoax, as any trained person would recognize the probable circumstances which gave rise to the light fixture appearing as unidentified flying objects.

2. A request was made on 13 July 1960, for an investigation of the Oak Hill, W. Va. sightings. The investigation was made on 21 July 1960, and all information will be forwarded to ATIC at a later date.

29 July 1960

I am returning your photographs and negatives submitted with your letter of 6 July 1960 reporting to show unidentified flying objects.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has determined that these are definitely pictures of light fixtures reflecting on a window.

For your information I am including the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects. It plainly states the Air Force's position in regard to this subject.
