FTL (IOETRS)
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio 45433

Dear Sir,

Enclosed in this letter is a Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire on a sighting made October 19, 1969. Because of the extensive sighting made in northern Ohio I would like to have another copy of the Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire. As soon as possible I would like a reply to this letter containing the conclusion of the Air Force evaluation of my report.

Thank you,

Sincerely yours,

[Signature and name are redacted/blacked out]

Here is the text I can read from the document:

AFR 80-17(C)

Date: 17     Month: Dec.     Year: 1969

10     15     16     66

[Most of the middle section is blacked out/redacted]

At the bottom of the document is a partial diagram showing an angle or arc measurement, with points labeled A and B.

The document appears to be a standard form with some sections obscured by black redaction marks.

The text I can read on this document is:

AFB WATCH

At the bottom of the page, there are two captions:
(Becomes Attachment 1 to AFB Form)

On the right side of the page, there is a circular compass-like diagram with cardinal and ordinal directions, and two additional diagrams showing what appear to be landscape or terrain views.

Most of the form on the left side of the page is not clearly legible. There is a handwritten note that appears to say "to explain was to the best of its phenomenon", but parts of this are difficult to read with complete certainty.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

[Left Page]
Flashing lights and speed of object.

(Handwritten notes on diagram include)

[Bottom of both pages]
(Reverse Attachment 1 to AFR 80-17)

The rest of the text appears to be in form fields that are partially obscured or too faint to read completely. There is a hand-drawn sketch/diagram on the right side of the page with some annotations about stars and lights.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

(Reverse Attachment 1 to AFR 99-17)

Some text is illegible due to the image quality and document formatting.


- page 6 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

There was a aircraft flying in the vicinity to the left of the object. Also, in the vicinity of the sight were high-tension wires.

The rest of the document appears to be heavily redacted with black markings obscuring most of the text.

The document header appears to show "AFR 80-17(C)" at the top of the page.

At the bottom of the page, there are notations for "Attachment 1" on both the left and right sides of the document.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] dtd 22 Oct 1969.

1. Reference your letter of 22 Oct 1969. From your description of the object, the flight path, and duration of the sighting, we feel that there is no evidence that the sighting could not have been of an aircraft.

2. We are enclosing a Blue Book which we hope you may find interesting.
