Proposed reply to letter from dtd 22 Oct 1969.

1. Reference your letter of 22 Oct 1969. From your description of the object, the flight path, and the duration of the sighting, we feel this is so evidence that the sighting could not have been of an aircraft.

2. We are enclosing a Blue Book which we hope you may find interesting.
