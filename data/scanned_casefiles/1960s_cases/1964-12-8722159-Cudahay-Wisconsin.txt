Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you related an observation of an object which you could not identify.

From the information which you submitted, the duration, speed, and are distance would indicate a meteor observation; however, the description including the color change is not consistent with this analysis. Your statement that the object seemed like it was going to run in your 15 not in accordance with the flight path from northeast ending in the south unless there was a change in course of the object.

Analysis at the Project Blue Book investigation office are unable to determine the cause of your observation. However, you can be assured that no unusual object or phenomena was observed in conjunction with the lunar eclipse on 18 December 1964.

Sincerely,

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (13 Dec 64, Cudahy, Wisconsin)                1 Feb 65

TO:   Hq USAF SAPOI PB (Wash D C 2030)

1.  Reference the attached letter from reporting an unidentified flying object observed on 13 Dec 64 over Cudahy, Wisconsin.

2.  The Lunar eclipse of 13 Dec 64 was observed by many astronomers, both professional and amateur, continuous photographs were made. No objects were reported from these observations.

3.  From the information which was presented to us it seems that the duration, speed and arc distance traveled would indicate a meteor observation, however, the description including color change is not consistent with this analysis. The statement that the objects seemed like it was going to run him is not in accord with the flight path from northeast ending in the south, unless there was a change in course of the reported object.

4.  Analysts are unable to determine the cause of his observation. However, we can assure Leslie that no unusual object or phenomena was observed in conjunction with the lunar eclipse.

Cudahy, Wisconsin

Dear Sir:

Even though I'm only 11 years old I don't see strange what went there. I might as well go right to the point, as I think I saw a flying saucer. I tell only my best friend who I know would believe me. Below are some details:

1) I saw one object. Place was 13 Wis. somewhere.
2) It was during an eclipse of the moon.
3) The object was a sphere.
4) The color of the object changed.
5) The speed was very fast.
6) I saw it come from the eclipse part of the moon.
7) I saw the object for about 7 seconds.
8) It started to path in the north east & ended its path in the south.

Cudahy like to say, it definitely could have seen a meteor, comet, star, planet, water, motion, space, and satellite, but I could't. It has been strange & mysterious because I don't look like my system.

Turn over.
