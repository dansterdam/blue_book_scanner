UNIDENTIFIED SPACE OBJECT

Location: British Columbia, B.C.
Date: 
Source: 

SUMMARY:

Afternoon mail, Agassiz from Lake Killarney, B.C., near Vancouver, British Province. The object reported was a bright white object moving at high speed across the sky. The witness, a reliable source, was driving on Highway 1 near Agassiz when he observed the object moving rapidly across the sky. The object appeared to be traveling at a high velocity with a west to east trajectory.

Object reported to have not or few characteristics on close-up view of British Columbia northeast of Fraser River along river shore about several miles east.

The object moved into view, went under three auto ton of height, the object shifted UNTIL 4 inch velocity into a test record of 6 miles.

Sighting was made by reliable source, a local civilian who was driving along the highway. The air defense radar system did not detect any unusual activity. Information was not correlated via official channels from British Columbia.

The document appears to be a typed report with some words difficult to fully discern. The text begins with "Please note" and seems to be related to aircraft or technical service documentation from British Columbia, Canada, dated around 1960. The bottom of the page mentions something about "automatic belief" and references the "sphere of British Columbia", but specific details are challenging to read with complete certainty.

Indian Dept.
U.S. Bureau of the Interior
Washington D.C.

Febri 1960

Sirs:

Please be advised that a group of Canadian Indians request investigation of a mysterious rocket device now in the interior of the Main Forrest in western Canada in area known as the MAIN FORREST OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.

The Athabasca Indians report that a large device or some sort of a Space Ship (Rocket?) has been reported by Athabasca Indian Scouts in British Columbia, object crashed in the interior of Canadian Province of British Columbia.

The Space Object is reported to be about 200 yards in diameter, about weight of 1000 tons. Object was reported to have come from direction of Alaska - in long horizontal slide of about 40 degrees from great height.

Object may have been a rocket? Satellite? or some sort of Space ship?

The Athabasca Indians call the device a "SASQUATCH SHIP" and report that object emits radiation rays of some sort. Might or might not glow in the dark. According to information received hear the object is in the interior of the Main Forrest area near the small Canadian settlement of AGGERSIS, BRITISH COLUMBIA WESTERN CANADA

The Space Ship? or Rocket? is said to be top of a plateau area, or local hill top near Frazer River, Canada

The object or Rocket is said to have hit Lake Fraser or some lake near Main Forrest area, then skidded across the lake about five miles, then large aircraft about several miles, then landed on the surface of the Fraser River. The Space object is then sighted uphill into some sort of heavy timber in the Main Forrest and is there under a heavy growth of timber now. The Athabasca Indians report that the object is concealed from air and is not visible from airplanes.

The Athabasca Indians are reportedly owners of the Main Forrest Forrest area. The Chief of the Athabasca Indians requests Governmental investigation of object to ascertain if object is HIDDEN METAL DEVICE or something in radiation rays, in the interior of the Main Forrest area of Western Canada near Aggersis, British Columbia, northwest of British Columbia settlement of Aggersis, Dr. Vol. 1a vicinity of Ruby Creek and Fraser River in heavy growth of timber in the Main Forrest area of western Canada.

Sincerely yours,
Hayes News Agency
Paris, France.

P/S: Space object might possibly be located by the use of Geiger Counter and Joint Pointers from low flying planes over the Main Forrest area of Western Canada near Aggersis, British Columbia.

Please note--The Chief of the Athabasca Indians reports that the Athabasca Tribe has a treaty with the United States dated year of 1784 by the Hardimanl treaty of the Athabasca Indian Tribe the treaty of British Crown with the Athabasca Indians gave the area to the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN 1784. Treaty.

Territories if Fairforest area was CEDED TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE YEAR OF 1784 by ATHABASCA HARDIMAN CROWN TREATY then the U.S.HAS EXPLORATORY RIGHTS TO THE MAIN FOREST AREA ALONG THE TRAIL. RICH and therefore is also the CHIEF of all objects, devices, rockets-missiles, SPACE SHIPS --Interplanetary flying devices- minerals -land timber and waters in the area from UNITED STATES BORDER to MAIN FOREST and including land in the MAIN FOREST area and the waters along the FRASER river and LAKE FRASER, etc --this would include the mysterious object known as "MAGNETIC SHIP" believed to be a Interplanetary Vehicle on FRASER RIVER TIMERED PLATEAUS area. Indians report that device left scattered timber in a path about 1 mile in extent in undergrowth of timber, however shape of timber is not visible at present time due to snow fall and heavy timber.

The Athabasca Indians report that the tribe cedes the mysterious object to the United States government for removal to the United States of America. It is said that the device is about 1000 long tons weight and IF SO, it WILL be necessary to transfer DEVICE from British Columbia via A SPECIAL RAILROAD BUILT FROM THE U.S.-CANADIAN BORDER to SEATTLE-CANADIAN WILDERNESS AREA OF RAIL FOREST SO AS TO TRANSPORT THE OBJECT OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TONS WEIGHT.

Special Information

C.I.A. Station,
174 - U.S.A.,
March 9, 1960.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police
To: Ottawa Police Hdqtrs.
Ottawa, Canada.

Sirs:

Please be advised that the ATHABASCA INDIANS of BRITISH COLUMBIA PROVINCE in Eastern Canada, Commonwealth of Canada, report that some sort of a SPACE SHIP or "FLYING SAUCER" has been seen in the heavy timbered area of the British Columbia Rain Forest Area. The Athabascan Indian tribe locates somewhere in the Space Ship as "SAUCER SHIP" in the Athabasca language meaning "SKY BOAT".

According to recent reports from a group of hunters with the Athabasca Indians of British Columbia, the object is said to have come out of sky and hit a lake (Lake Fraser?) then rose into air and hit on Fraser River in British Columbia Province of Canada. The Space object (Missile? or possibly rockets?) is said to be a heavy timber area of the place known as

RAIN FORREST
AUGASSIS, BRITISH COLUMBIA, (Canada)

The Space ship or Satellite is reported to be circular, about 200 yards in diameter, and the Indians state with weight estimated of 1000 tons, object is made of white metal. The British Columbia Indians report that object is on a plateau area after it slid from Fraser River uphill into (and Thru) timber and is now stalled down a heavy growth of timber in the British Columbia timbered area named "RAIN FORREST". (Near Agassis, British Columbia, Canada)

The Athabasca Indians reported that the object emits a glow at night or "LIGHT" (possibly radiation). In view of recent reports of unidentified flying objects (U.F.O.) perhaps it may be advisable to send some competent investigators from the R.C.M.P. office? It may be possible to locate the Space Ship (or Missile-Satellite?) by use of a low-flying plane over Rain Forrest-plane equipped with a Geiger counter and Aerial-counter aerial URANIUM LOCATING DEVICE, might be able to find the object as Indians believe it is radioactive object?

British Columbia Indians report that the strange object is 50 miles from Agassis, (N.W.?) in the heavy Rain Forrest area.

[The text is partially faded and some words are difficult to read, but I'll transcribe what I can clearly make out]

[Top of document appears to have some header information that is mostly illegible]

It would appear from the letter that the object 50 miles northwest of Agassiz, such is the case to verify the sighting in the Fraser River area in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. The location is noted in the letter from the witness who claims to have seen the object.

In the quest to verify the sighting, it is approximately 50 miles northwest of Agassiz. The world would place the object in the Coquihalla River area, which is approximately 50 miles from Agassiz and west from the river.

Agassiz is a small town located in British Columbia. The object is supposed to be near Agassiz and 50 miles from the river. Agassiz is located in the Pacific Ocean area. The Fraser River without being seen by local residents is very remote.

Limited and discreet enquiries were made regarding the possibility that a UFO had landed near Agassiz or Harrison Lake area, but these enquiries did not reveal anything.

From the information contained in the letter and other local area sources, no definitive conclusion could be drawn. The opinion of the local area sources was inconclusive.

Agassiz is 45 miles northwest of Vancouver. There are some logging camps in the area. The country is covered by various mountain ranges and the area could be surveyed by air. It is suggested that a survey be completed and further instructions and arrangements be completed.

Investigation (British Columbia)

4th USAF FAG (HEDCOM)
New York

Reference letter from _____, Eaves News Agency, Paris,
France to General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, Chief of Staff, U.S. Army

Mr. _____ States in his letter that it was reported to the Eaves
News Agency that a space machine crashed in British Columbia in the
vicinity of Fraser River near Agassiz. The object was reported to be
approximately 200 yards in diameter and estimated to weigh 1,500 tons,
prior to coming to rest in a densely wooded area, the object was reported
to have struck a lake from a trajectory of about 30 degrees, slid across
the lake at a high velocity, rose again into the air, skipped again on
the Fraser River, then slid to its final resting place. The object is
reported not visible from the air due to heavy woods. The witnesses,
members of the Chilcotin, Chilkasa and Chilkoot Indians, further describe the object as circular, and of a metal which looks like stainless steel and emitting some type
of radiation.

Mr. _____ States this information was from the Royal Mounted Police
and that the Eaves News Agency received it via Sarreute National, Paris,
France and Queens Messenger Service, London, England.

An unidentified flying object sighted on 14 Feb 60 from Nome and Unalaska, Alaska has received an unusual amount of congressional and
public interest. Mr. _____ indicates possible connection of the object
with the Nome and the object supposedly on the ground in British Columbia.
We understand that for this reason and our primary responsibility
is intelligence that an investigation must be conducted to determine if
this object exists and if so, its identity.

Request that an investigation be conducted through the United States
Attache to Canada to determine the following:

1. Has a report of this alleged object reached the Canadian Government?

2. If such a report was made:

AFIC FORM 144 (REV 28 SEP 58)    ROUTING AND COORDINATION SHEET

- page 27 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

(1) Are the identities of the witnesses known?
(2) Has an official investigation been conducted?
(3) Was the object located?
(4) Was the report originated by the Royal Mounted Police?

c. If the object was located, what was its specific position
d. What was the direction from which the object came?
e. If the object was identified, what were the conclusions of the investigators?
f. What are the dimensions and other descriptions of the object?
g. Is the Canadian Government aware of any occurrence which could explain the report?

There are a number of factors which tend to discredit this report. The envelope is postmarked Davenport, Iowa (attachment nr 2) and not Canada, France. The weight and size of the object must be assumed exaggerated. An object 600 feet across and with a weight of 2,000,000 pounds would have ripped a swath through woods that could easily be seen from the air; and an object two football fields in diameter would not be hidden by trees. The report states that the Indian witnesses said the object was giving off some type of radiation. No particulars about the individual witnesses was provided, ATTIC, but the Encyclopaedia Britannica 1959 states that the Athabaskas Indian tribes are a backward people.

All indications are that this report is a hoax, but an investigation must be conducted to remove even the slightest doubt of it being true.
