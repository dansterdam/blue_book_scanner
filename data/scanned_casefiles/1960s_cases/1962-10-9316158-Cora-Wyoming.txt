SUMMARY: At 17152 hours, 2 November 1962 a report of an UFO sighting was received from Cora, Wyoming, 139 10" North - 109° 40' West, whose local address is Salt Lake City, Utah. At the G. P. Ranch, located on Green River Canyon, and looking out of a large picture window of the ranch house, he sighted a brilliantly lighted object at approximately 2400Z hours on 29 October 1962 while looking directly up Green River Canyon. He sighted an object that was highly illuminated, at an altitude of approximately 12,000 feet. Object remained semi-motionless for a period of approximately 5 minutes. Object started to gain altitude for a minute and one half, then appeared to grow brighter and come closer to where he was sitting, until the object was within a half mile or where Decker was observing the object... At this point he could make out the outline of a conventional type aircraft with... all landing lights on. The object disappeared over the ranch property and down the course of the Green River.

Very shortly after this at an altitude of approximately 16,000 to 17,000 feet, Decker sighted an object more brilliantly illuminated than the previous object. For a period of time, 1 1/2 to 20 minutes, it stayed motionless, then started to gain altitude very slowly and drift toward the ranch. The object was observed for approximately 1 1/2 hours. When last noted the altitude of the object was approximately 40,000 feet. At this time they retired for the evening and next morning the object was gone.

1. At 17152 hours, 2 November 1962, a report of the sighting of two objects on 29 October 1962 at 2400Z hours at the G. P. Ear Ranch, Cora, Wyoming. The first object was sighted coming up Green River Canyon, making a turn and coming back and disappeared down Green River Canyon. Altitude of the object was approximately 12,000 feet and was identified as a conventional type aircraft, the size of a Navy RD-4 transport. The aircraft was brightly illuminated, as if all landing lights were on.

2. Object No. 2 was seen as the first object disappeared. This object was 6,000 to 7,000 feet higher and more brightly illuminated. It stayed motionless for a period of 15 to 20 minutes, then started to gain altitude very slowly until it was approximately 40,000 feet. The ran house was a north westerly direction.

3. At 18302 hours, 2 November 1962, Mr. [redacted], Salt Lake City, Utah. Following information was received during the interview, and answers to questions are presented by paragraph number of items of information requested in paragraph 14, AFR 200-2, dated 20 July 1962.

1-4x    Presurring Officer: Howard W. Lucas, CS-7 and TSgt Theodore L. Tatton,
are investigating, Security and Law Enforcement Division, (Hill Air Force Base), Utah.
Preliminary analysis indicates observer is a logical and mature person. He is convinced that object No. 1 was a conventional aircraft with full landing lights on.
Object No. 2 could not be identified. He consistently described the objects as to bright illumination and movement. The observer was the only recorded witness to this sighting. There are no known manufacturers of experimental aircraft in the area, and no known missile firings are being conducted other than static tests. With the submission of this report, it is believed that all local efforts to identify the objects have been exhausted.

Investigators Note: Although the observer believes that the Object No. 1 mentioned in this report was a conventional type aircraft, information is furnished with this report to this object image as the object seemed to have some connection with Object No. 2, which is unidentified.

UFO SIGHTING
Grenever Canyon, Wyoming
29 October 1962

Observers: Mr. [redacted], age 44
Cora(?)], Wyoming & Salt Lake City, Utah

Mr. [redacted] manages and leases the [redacted] owned by his father. The summer is a [redacted] operating primarily in the summer months.

Mr. [redacted], age 66
Cora(?)], Wyoming & [redacted] (?)

Location: [redacted] Canyon, about 200 air miles from Casper, Wyoming.

Time: Shortly after 1700. Observer looked at watch at 5:30 and estimated that the object had appeared about 15 minutes previously. Dusk, not yet dark but not light enough for clear visibility.

Course: Object #1: First observed about 12 miles up Grenever Canyon. It turned (fm up to down), came down Grenever Canyon to a position over Grenever Lake, moved down Grenever River in Grenever Valley. It appeared in the southeast and moved northwest down the Grenever River.

Object #2: Elevation first at 16000 feet, then ascended very slowly to estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. Object became smaller. Object appeared in the east and traveled west.

The observers were in a home situated [redacted] Canyon through a large window. The object was highly illuminated and estimated to be about 12 miles up the canyon. The altitude was estimated to be between 11,000 and 12,000 feet. The object remained semi-stationary for a period of about five minutes and then started to disappear for an estimated period of about one to one and a half minutes. If then appeared to grow brighter and come nearer to where the observers were located.

Viewing the object through field glasses (power eight), it was impossible to see any object other than the light until the object was within an approximate distance of about a half mile. At that time, the observer was able to see a faint silhouette, as the object approached the outline of a conventional aircraft, fuselage and wings, was discernable. There was no aircraft apparently was burning trail, tail or exhaust. At last sighting through the field glasses, the object appeared to be the size of an R4-D transport (as used by the Navy in the last war). The total time of the sighting was ten minutes and the object seemed to be traveling from Southeast to Northwest.

Here is the text from the document:

Very shortly after the first object disappeared over the ranch property and down the course of the Glenever River, a second object at an altitude of about 16,000 to 17,000 feet was sighted further to the East about five ground miles down the canyon. This second object was more brilliantly illuminated than the first object and was surrounded by a pearlescent haze. The haze was about twice the width of the object and surrounded the object on the edges. The object remained more or less stationary for a period of about .15 to 20 minutes, then started to gain in altitude (too slowly for any known aircraft, said observers) and very slowly drift toward the observers. At that time it was nearly dark and it was not possible to identify anything other than the lights of the second object. The light was not orange enough or red enough to be a flame. The object appeared as a mass of bright light, possibly oval in shape, but at no time did the observers see any form. At the highest altitude of the object, both observers agreed, it was approximately the size of a quarter full moon and the haze was similar to that sometimes seen around the moon. The light of the object was compared to a phosphorescent glow rather than that of an electric light. There was no sound, trail, tail or exhaust. Total time of sighting was one to one and a half hours and the object traveled toward the west. The observers retired before the object was out of sight, and was not visible the following morning.

Attention was first drawn to the objects because at the time of their appearance, it was not yet time for stars to be visible. The sky was cloudless.

Observers reported the first object to be below the highest point of a nearby mountain range and the second object about 7,000 to 8,000 feet above the highest point (14,000 feet).

The second object was not the color or shape of any star and the observers are convinced that the object was man-made (but contending that it rose too slowly for any known aircraft). They realize the presence of an air base in Casper, Wyoming and attribute the sighting of the first object to this fact as jets have been known to traverse the area. The observers expressed the fact that the time of day could impair identification of the object and that the object was sighted near a flight path. There is no record of any unusual aerial phenomena in the area.
