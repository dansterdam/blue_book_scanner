to yourself in Washington. It is difficult to assess the amount lost by flaking
after weighing at the college. Incidentally, Dr. Kusian assures me that the
weighing was fairly accurate and could not have varied as much as plus or
minus 1/10% of a milligram. The packaging for transmission may have
resulted in some further loss of mass by flaking with the flakes caught
in the tape that surrounded the two watch glasses which enclosed the sample.
It was not feasible to place it in any other type of container and we were
anxious not to add it with any material which could add to the flaking. The
handling it received by postal employees could very well have resulted in further
loss of particles or flakes from the main mass onto the dish or the enclosing
tape.

I had assumed that the particle would be weighed immediately
upon receipt and that any flaking could have been accounted for in a more
stable situation. In addition it occurred to me that a section could be cut
from the mass to avoid any errors that may be associated with the dislodging
of fragments or encrustation.

The analysis intrigues me as does the apparent change in
mass. Assuming that some of the change in mass could be accounted for by
the flaking we still have a discrepancy. Is it possible that another principle
might be operating? Assuming the particle had been in a 'neutralized'
gravity state for some time could it not have acquired an 'excess' of gravity
upon impact and like a pendulum swing back and forth in mass until it finally
comes to rest at a given position. I am certain that the effect of adsorption
and the like will be taken care of in the sealed container weighings.

I trust that some answers to this intriguing puzzle may soon
be brought to light.

Here is the text from the document:

However, this entire analysis probes only the very thin layer near the surface, and in this layer the proportion of barium is very high.

A comparison was made between Sample #2 and standard containing the following:

20% Ba
0.2% Sr
2.0% Cu
2.% Fe
2.% Mn
1.6% Cl
1.1% S

The results indicated that the sample contained all of these elements, in approximately these proportions, with perhaps 1% to 30% barium instead of the amount listed above. However, this figure for barium is high because of surface segregation, and therefore this should be considered an analysis of the surface layer. As indicated in the previous section, Aluminum and Magnesium also make up part of the specimen.

Without destroying the sample by homogenizing it, we cannot make any quantitative estimates of analysis by weight. However, the following guess might be put forward on the basis of the surface layers exposed to the X-ray beam.

Ba              15.%

At 9:30 PM of here current reporter Jno C. Thoro appeared at the Detective Division in company
of Thomas Gobert, town tel. officer Trinity 1126, ret. from his associate instructor at Southern Conn.
College and formerly with Cana State Teachers College. He is a fire inspector of NCDX/NAXCX
section 67 in New Haven. He made a visual observation of his substance recovered and stated that
it was unrecognizable to assure that the object was launched locally or thrown. It does no resemblance
to and not scientific. Conclusion that it may be part of some oxidized sulfide and that its color
of green may be attributed to copper less likely Cobalt. The fused material indicated that some
copper salt may be present. The material itself is basically insoluble can be seen oxidized by what
appears to be the rapid passage thru atmosphere.

It was suggested that the material be preserved and forwarded upon request to the National
Aeronautics and Space Agency Washington DC Director T. Keith Glennon.

HEADQUARTERS

Preliminary Analysis and Certain Historical Details Relating
to Objects which Fell at Hartford, Connecticut

Chief, Nuclear Studies Branch

The following historical summary is by Dr. John T. Wasson
who journeyed to Hartford, Connecticut on 17 September 1960, and
talked at length with the principal witnesses.

At 2015 E.D.T. on the night of 4 September 1960, a lady
standing near the back door of her first floor apartment at
Hartford, Connecticut, was startled by a
"swishing noise" followed by a thud. Upon looking, through the door,
she observed a "cone of green fire" which immediately subsided.
The cone of fire was of the order of one foot in height. She
attempted to go out the door to investigate, but was driven back
clouds of smoke. The witness' name is Mrs.

Another lady, living on the second floor of the apartment
house, is reported to have heard the sound of the fall above the
noise of her television set. She thereupon ran out onto the back
balcony and saw "glowing embers" on the ground at the site of the
fall.

At the same time, Mrs., an employee of a cafe four
houses east of there at (The White Cedars),
was standing in the kitchen and observing through a window the
proceedings of a dance taking place in the residence immediately
to the west. She had just noticed the time at 2012 and mentioned
it to someone in the kitchen. Her attention was caught by a green,
pendant-shaped object in the western sky in which orange and red
colors were also visible. Her duties were near a window in
the kitchen, and she apparently did not follow the object with her
eyes until it struck the earth.

Back at the superintendent of the
apartment house, Mr., was called from his apartment on
the second floor. The smoke having cleared, he and Mrs.
proceeded first to throw a little water on the coal-carrying
which was smoldering, and then to search for the objects. A
flashlight was the light source.

They first searched at a point about a yard from the building. There being no crater could be seen and no other immediate evidence as to where it landed. After a little while, however, the spot was discovered by Mr. [redacted] by virtue of the fact that it was warm when touched with the palm of the hand.

This spot was just beneath the spot where the garbage shed was demolished. After this discovery the location, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] started gathering small objects. At first they apparently were warned as a requisite to dismissing the true "stones" and the very large "background" of stones and objects in the immediate vicinity, i.e., all along the edge of the shed. Later they noticed a white crust on the objects and used this as a basis for their search.

The object landed in an ideal place as far as offering the possibility of determining its trajectory. The only open to it if its azimuthal angle was 60-70Â° or smaller were a 15Â° segment coming from about 20Â° E of North, and another 15Â° segment coming from almost due west.

Completely eliminating the segment from the east, roughly from 250 to 205. The apartment building, shielded the location from the northwest, and a utility pole, a wooden fence and a 2-1/2-story house shielded it from the southwest. Mrs. [redacted] and a lady watching television both reported that the object sounded like it came from the north. If so, it navigated through clotheslines mounted on all three stories without breaking one. The other direction, the west, is roughly that where the object was seen in the air by Mrs. [redacted] (perhaps should not have affected her view appreciably) and seems to be the more likely direction of approach.

After Mrs. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] had picked up the objects, the police were called and eventually the word reached Prof. Robert Brown of Southern Connecticut State College, who is in charge of the New Haven Moonwatch Station, Prof. Brown and Capt. Hankwitz of the Hartford Police got in contact with the Smithsonian Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a share of the stones were sent over to their organization.

Mrs. [redacted] and the [redacted] family retained shares also. The story was in various newspapers and came thus to the attention of Dr. Townsend Brown of Wheaton, Washington, D.C. He contacted ARPA and obtained the release of the Smithsonian stones to him. Officials at the Smithsonian gave the collection to Dr. Brown, and indicated that the stones were clearly not meteoritic in origin. He transported the stones to the Geophysics Research Directorate for analysis, leaving about half the sample.

Here is the text from the document:

there. A week later, he obtained the shares of Mrs. ______ and Mr. ______

Dr. Wasson of CRD went to Hartford, Connecticut on 17 September 1960 to obtain more information on the fall. His information, other than reported above, concerns chiefly the problem of separating "true" stones from those in the immediate area. Photographs which he made at the time show this graphically, and a collection of background stones which he obtained appear very similar to many in the sample.

Dear Major Friend:

It was a pleasure to be with you last Wednesday. I was glad to have the opportunity to give you some information on the Hartford fall. It has been an engaging subject to me for the reasons I explained to you.

Professor Robert Brown telephoned me upon my return to Washington and mentioned that your office had requested additional samples. I told him of our visit and that no samples are available because of work in progress. I assured him, however, that you would be furnished complete reports of our investigation, and that our efforts would be closely coordinated with the Air Force.

It was a pleasure to be with you on September 4, and to have the opportunity to examine the material which fell at Hartford, Connecticut, on September 4. After careful consultation, you comprehend the original 8 leaves. This material was not meteoritic, and therefore of no further interest to your group at the Astrophysical Laboratory.

You will recall that during my visit I was in touch with the Air Force and personally delivered some of this material to the Air Force Research Center at Bedford, Massachusetts for analysis.

I promised to send Dr. McCrosky at your laboratory, copies of the Hartford police reports and other reports for your permanent file, and these are enclosed.

Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter.

Dr. T. Townsend Brown,
Whitehall-Rand, Inc.,

Washington 6, D.C.

Dear Dr. Brown:

I should like to clarify some aspects of the particle sent you from New Haven.

It is not part of the Hartford fall but a distinct fall both spatially and with reference to time. It is my opinion, however, that both falls are related to the same orbiting object. The relatively larger particle sent you through the mails fell in Woodbridge, a suburb of New Haven. The airline distances between the two falls (Hartford and Woodbridge) is roughly 47 miles along a line within heading 18 approximately 30 degrees (N 30Â° E). Certain aspects of the fall are the same as those of the Hartford fall. However, the Woodbridge particle fell essentially intact with only a slight general scattering of the metallic dust noted in the area where it landed in an area (asphalt driveway) that had been carefully swept clean. The particle, an impact area calculated a "cracked circle" 54 inches in diameter with a slight elongation to the North. Contained within this circle were several "splotches" of the metallic material with the largest particle slightly off center toward the north. The time of fall could easily be established as between 9:30 A.M. and 12:30 P.M. local time after the discovery. Mrs. _____ had walked by the area at 9:30 and noted nothing unusual, whereas upon returning from a drive into New Haven was astounded at noting when she returned at 12:30 the object within the swept circle. She had first noticed at once, then phoned a friend, Prof. _____ Curator of the Peabody Museum at Yale University who in turn suggested she notify me. I recovered the particle after noting the conditions, returned to the college and notified you by phone.

I might add that no final can be prepared until the earlier portion of the interval inasmuch as it was not warm when picked up.

Now, sir, the large particle was encrusted with some peculiar metallic coating noted previously. Obviously some of this was lost when the particle was kicked, and some when I packed it to mail material prior to bringing it to a college. When Dr. Louis Kahan of the Johnson Department weighed the object it still showed some flaking of the loosened material. Obviously more material could have flaked off during transportation by mail.

to yourself in Washington. It is difficult to assess the amount lost by flaking
after weighing at the college. Incidentally, Dr. Kuslan assures me that the
weighing was fairly accurate and could not have varied as much as plus or
minus 1/10% of a milligram. The packaging for transmission may have
resulted in some further loss of mass by flaking with the flakes caught
in the tape that surrounded the two watch glasses which enclosed the sample.
It was not feasible to place it in any other type of container and we were
anxious not to add it with any material which could add to the flaking. The

the flaking we still have a discrepancy. Is it possible that another principle
might be operating? Assuming the particle had been in a 'neutralized'
gravity state for some time could it not have acquired an 'excess' of gravity
upon impact and like a pendulum swing back and forth in mass until it finally
comes to rest at a given position. I am certain that the effect of adsorption
and the like will be taken care of in the sealed container weighings.

I trust that some answers to this intriguing puzzle may soon
be brought to light.

SUBJECT: "Woodbridge" fall of suspected gravitationally anomalous material

Dear Professor Brown:

Thank you for your letter of October -- and the additional information concerning the Woodbridge fall. I am inclined to agree with your initial observations, and this source to be borne out by further investigation of the performance.

This subject has not been officially clarified to the best of my knowledge, but I suspect that it may soon be, and I will keep you to notify you to make any matter can be finally decided.

We are continuing the work on physical tests of the chunk of material which you sent to us. Even though you anticipated no difficulties to eliminate the possible effects of moisture or occluded gases, the weight of the sample is no objection. Continuing, the amount of white surface indication is increased, and, as I mentioned over the telephone, your intervention, only partially, can contain certain new ideas of further and method in extremely high post-temperatures.

The continuity change in weight is startling and intriguing. Since Dr. -- claims recent finding is that the material appears to have lost over 350 gm and is still decreasing. A most curious observation (and perhaps a speculation) is induced by this finding which will be discussed, perhaps soon you may have the opportunity to come back into some other things.

In reading your letter, there are certain questions or comments which occur.

1. What was the date of the Woodbridge fall? Perhaps you covered this in a telephone conversation, but I have no record of it. I note that you believe that the material probably fell between 1:30 and 10:30 a.m., and that I did not seem to be directly related to the Hartford fall of September 4, 1960.

2. You mention "spitchets of the metallic material" at the area of impact -- what has become of the metal and ore samples available to us?

3. Would Dr. Kosslan give me an affidavit covering the weighing operation, so as to have a formal record of its accuracy and authenticity?

4. When I received the material from you (showing the two watch glasses), I looked closely for any flaking or evidence of detached particles. Nothing was found.

5. I am greatly interested in your thoughts of an oscillating bend in the weight-change following impact. While the observed curve shows irregularity, the steady trend is definitely downward, and there is no evidence so far of any regular oscillation.

While we are deeply grateful to Mrs. [redacted] for her alertness, for turning the material over to you and for her interest in what may come of it, I suspect, in the interests of science, that it will be some time before this piece of material can be relied upon. This is especially true as the more important because, from theoretical considerations, the material would appear to have a definite (half-life) rate of decay, and every effort is being made to utilize it while it is "hot".

Major Friend tells me that he may use frequent trips to Washington, so by copy of this letter, I wish to invite him to stop in upon his next visit to learn more in detail what is happening. I would be very glad to see him.

Again, thank you for your kind collaboration, and I shall look forward to your visit in the near future.

a. Tuesday, 6 December 1950:
a. Major Friend, ACTN-1452x, visited L/Col Tucker, SAFOI-36, and assisted with the preparation of the SAFOI annual face sheet on unclassified flying objects.

b. L/Col Tucker informed Maj Friend that his appearance on the Garroway show, January, 5 Dec 60, had been extended for the entire program as a result of telephone calls from the Winant public. Maj Friend learned to a large extent of the show. A copy of the recording has been requested for the ATIC files. For those who heard the first portion of the show, the second half was generally the same. L/Col Tucker was positively in the affirmative.

c. Maj Friend read L/Col Tucker's book entitled "Flying Saucers and the United States Air Force". (ACOS (A) 1st book) He was generally in agreement with the material reviewed by ATIC. Several corrections were made to the technical material, and are being included in the second edition which is presently in draft.

The first half of the book was sold out within two days of going on the stands.

Maj Friend met with B/Gen Le Bailly, SAFOI, Dr. J. A. Hynek (in Washington on other business) and L/Col Tucker concerning recent inquiries to [redacted] for recent data. Hynek Andrews Garries Sub-committee (see Carl Tinson). A complete outline of what action the Air Force had taken toward implementing inquiries was given by Dr. Hynek during the meeting on 15 July 1960 (Atch #2). The cases which renewed interest in Star's Internal in this matter were sightings near Redding Bluff, California sightings which occurred during 12-20 August 1960.

Maj Friend briefed L/Col Sullivan, ACTIN-PLA, of the developments and informed him of the planned meeting between W/Gen Walsh and B/Gen Le Bailly.

Thursday, 8 December 1960:

A meeting was held in the office of B/Gen Le Bailly. Present at the meeting were the following:

B/Gen Le Bailly, SAFOI
Col Hall, AFCIN
L/Col Hacker, SAFOI
Maj Friend, ATIC
Dr. J. A. Hynek, ATIC Consultant

At this meeting the problem concerning the requirements of the sub-committee were outlined for Col Hall. Col Hall instructed Maj Friend to prepare for him an outline of what is necessary to implement the UFO project at ATIC with the requirements spelled out by [redacted].

Wednesday, 7 December 1960:

Maj Friend monitored a radio program (Patty Cavin Show, WGR, Radio) which featured an interview of L/Col Tucker concerning UFO's and his book. Incidentally, L/Col Tucker stated that the Air Force had no evidence to date which indicated that [remainder of text partially illegible]

Contacted Commander Robert Luker, AFPA, concerning his interest in material recovered in Hartford, Connecticut 1 Sept 1960. This case was investigated by Dr. J. Townsend Brown. Additional data by Maj Friend to Commander Luker indicated that the samples of material which related to the sighting were collected by Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown instrumental in having a portion of the sample released to Cambridge Research Division for analysis. In the course of analysis, Dr. Brown was able to isolate a few simple crystals. Commander Luker indicated that his interest was stimulated from the fact that he was particularly interested in the nature of the sample. Dr. Brown promised Maj Friend a copy of his report on the preliminary analysis of the samples of J. Townsend Brown, indicated that they were losing interest in the case.

Item 7 (Cont)
The analysis was completed. The completed analysis by Cambridge shows unusual combinations and quantities of elements, but there is no conclusive evidence that the material is from Sputnik 77, or any other satellite. Possibly correlation between the Loboratory, WADD, and Whitehall Rand reports will reveal further information on the source of this material.

5. Next course of action:

a. Prepare draft of a letter from M/Gen Doughes to Col Hall outlining what is needed to implement the requirements requested by Mr Smart.

b. Upon receiving a copy of the report from Whitehall Rand, make a comparison between the Cambridge, WADD, and Whitehall Rand reports. Inform all interested agencies of this final analysis.

c. Follow-up on the taped copy of the Carroway show.

DRAFT

Description and Analysis of Hartford, Connecticut Samples

DRAFT

The samples of the object which fell at Hartford on 4 September 1960 were designated and described as follows upon their arrival at the Geophysics Research Directorate:

1. Single separate piece - coal?
2. Metal pieces - aluminum?
3. Stony material
4. Powder of the surface of the coal of No. 5
5. Fragments of large pieces of coal
6. Pieces of material looking like coke
7. Magnetic material (slag)
8. Coke?

The designations have been retained, although certain samples have been further divided into letters a, g., b became 2A, 2C. Pictures were taken of the samples in order to help identify them, and for descriptive purposes in case it became necessary to destroy any of them. These pictures are included in this report.

The background samples brought back from Hartford on 17 September have been designated:

9. Slag
10. Anthracite
11. Black, light ball

and "Wasson's collection"

The numerical sequence was retained to avoid possible
confusion with the sample materials.

As can be seen, the 11 segments can be put into 4 groups.
1. carbonaceous
2. light-metallic (aluminum)
3. stony
4. slag

Of these, the slag seems certain to be of Hartford origin,
the stones were not analyzed, the carbonaceous material is in the
background but is inconclusive as to origin. Only the aluminum
samples seem clearly due to the observed fall. And, therefore,
the most time was spent in their analysis.

Analysis of carbonaceous samples

The carbonaceous samples are 1, 4, 5, 6, and 3 and the
background samples 10 and 11. Samples 10 "anchor" and
11 "black light ball" are very similar in composition. They look
like coal, and the Compton spread of the exciting W lines indicates
a very low average atomic number. The x-ray fluorescent analysis
showed more Sr in 11, otherwise the spectra are almost identical.
They contain caesium and Ba.

Sample 5 (coalish, mounted with white-coated side toward
exciting beam) when compared with the background samples 10
and 11 shows large differences, namely it contains large amounts
of Ba (up by a factor of 10 or larger), and less Zn. The heights
of the first order peaks are follows, using a LiF crystal and
W source at 30 Kv., 20 ma.

Analysis of light metallic samples.

Sample No. 2 X-ray fluorescence analysis:

A piece of Al of 48 mmÂ² area was compared to all three 2a, b and c. The spectrometer was aligned for the Al KÎ± line, and the third order ba LÎ³, suppressed by pulse height selection. The ratio of Al KÎ± intensity from the sample to that from Aluminum was 0.28, indicating a large proportion of Aluminum in the samples.

A standard was prepared having Magnesium, Aluminum and Barium in the following ratios:
Mg/Al = .48;   Ba/Al = .51

From the relative intensities of the Mg KÎ±, Al KÎ±, and Ba LÎ³ lines, it was determined that the indicated proportions were:
0.01 Mg and 0.96 Ba

However, the Ba KÎ± ratio from the standard was 10 times Ba/L, indicating a strong surface segregation of Ba in the sample. Therefore, the Ba data contains a possible bias of 10. In concentration, if we apply this only to the Barium, and assume that the Mg and Al are uniformly distributed, we obtain the estimate of:

30% Aluminum
1% Magnesium
10% Barium

Bem


- page 72 -

Here is the text from the document:

However, this entire analysis probes only the very thin layer near the surface, and in this layer the proportion of barium is very high.

A comparison was made between Sample #2 and standard containing the following:

20% Ba
0.2% Sr
2.0% Cu
2.% Fe
2.% Mn
1.6% Cl
1.1% S

The results indicated that the sample contained all of these elements, in approximately these proportions, with perhaps 1% to 30% barium instead of the amount listed above. However, this figure for barium is high because of surface segregation, and therefore this should be considered an analysis of the surface layer. As indicated in the previous section, Aluminum and Magnesium also make up part of the specimen.

Without destroying the sample by homogenizing it, we cannot make any quantitative estimates of analysis by weight. However, the following guess might be put forward on the basis of the surface layers exposed to the X-ray beam.

Element         Percent Composition
Ba              15.%
Sr              0.2
Zn              2.0
Cu              4.0
