Transcribed text:

The sky was clear at the time and I saw a bright light moving across the sky. I thought at first it was a shooting star, but then I noticed that it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star. It seemed to disappear and reappear at intervals as it moved across the sky. I watched it for several minutes and then it disappeared. I did not hear any sound. It was a clear night but I could not see any shape or outline, only the bright light moving across the sky. I have seen many shooting stars but this light seemed to move in a more controlled manner and was visible for a much longer period of time. I cannot explain what I saw, but it seemed highly unusual and unlike any ordinary astronomical phenomenon I have ever observed.

Sept. 4, 1960

The undersigned officer went to the rear porch of her home at 2:30 a.m., and noticed a round metallic object hovering about 150-200 ft. off the ground. It was about 30 ft. in diameter, and was emitting a bright light. It stopped suddenly, turned off the light, and came down very close to the ground. Immediately she saw a green flare about a foot high come down, and then it went back up into the object. The object then turned on a headlight and returned to the search. She observed it for 8 min. on the ground, the light went off, and it seemed to squash down to a thin line and disappear. The witness said the wind was slight and quiet, and there were no noise from the object.

At 1:00-a.m., a noise attracted her attention. She saw a search light of some unknown origin, which was shining various particles which showed up like sparks on the ground near the house. After a while, the particles were lifted, and the search light was extinguished. 

The witness believes that there was some kind of activity, but she is unable to explain what it was. She does not know what to make of the incident.

Preliminary Analysis and Certain Historical Details Relating
to Object which fell at Hartford, Connecticut
Child, Sudden-bright Branch

The following historical summary is by Dr. John T. Wessen,
who interviewed at length with the principal witnesses.

On the night of 4 September 1960, a lady residing in Hartford, "Connecticut, reported seeing a "bright light moving rapidly across the sky, followed by a "blinding flash" and a "hissing noise". Upon looking toward the door, she observed an"object" hovering about 20 feet from the ground near the side of the house. The object attempted to go out the door to investigate, but was driven back by the sound of a motor. 

Another lady, living on the second floor of the apartment house, heard the commotion and looked out her window and saw "glowing embers" on the ground at the site of the disturbance.

At the same time, Mrs. a cafe four houses away, was standing in the kitchen and observing through a window the proceedings going on in the yard. Her attention was caught by a "glowing ember" descending through the air, which she believe d to be a "falling star". However, it was apparently too close to the ground. Mrs. attention was then caught by a noise in the kitchen, her attention drawn to a motion near the stove. There she saw what she described as a "small creature" standing near the stove. This "creature" soon vanished, and Mrs. stated that she apparently did not follow the "object" with her eyes until it left the kitchen.

Back at the apartment house, Mr. the superintendent, was called from his apartment on the second floor. Mr. eyes were drawn to a bright light on the ground, which he described as a "steady, cold, white light" about 2 feet in diameter. This light source then gradually diminished and went out. Mr. stated that a flashlight was the light source.

Text output from the document:

Possibly object landed in an ideal place, as far as effecting the precision of the observation was concerned. The observers had picked up the object through binoculars and had watched it through binoculars and with the naked eye for about 30 minutes.

The object was estimated to be about 15-20 feet in diameter and about 6-8 feet thick. Both observers reported that the object appeared to be metallic and seemed to emit a "faint glow". Its speed of movement was estimated to be around 25° to 25°. The object was reported to make a "slight buzzing" sound.

After this sighting, the police were called and eventually the word reached Capt. Bankard of the Hartford Police. Capt. Bankard got in contact with the individuals involved, interviewed and obtained additional details from the witnesses. All of this had been in the process of verification.

Dr. Hynek was in the v icinity at the time and supposedly picked up some stones that were allegedly fallen debris from the object.

Dr. Brown, and indicated that the object was clearly not a meteorite, and its characteristics precluded it being a typical atmospheric phenomenon. However, he could not positively identify it as extra-terrestrial in origin.

Dr. T. Townsend Brown

Washington D.C.

Dear Dr. Brown,

I should like to clarify some aspects of the particle sent you from New Haven.

It is not part of the Hartford fall but a distinct fall both spatially and with respect to time. It is now under additional investigation, however, and this fall is related to the same orbiting object. The relatively low-velocity fall does not belong to the same orbiting system as New Haven.

The airborne distance between the two falls (Hartford and Woodbridge) is approximately 7 miles. It is clearly not the same fall as the Woodbridge particle fall, however, as the Woodbridge particle fall is essentially intact with only a slight disturbance of their external configuration since they landed in an area (asphalt driveway) that had been very carefully swept and cleaned.

The particles arriving here (New Haven) were recovered by the area at 3:30 P.M. at a point where a large number of the metallic particles had become embedded in the grassy surface. According to the information given me by Mrs. Brown, these particles were identical in appearance to those which were recovered at 12:30 the same day in the area it appears they had recently traversed.

While the conditions seem apparently identical, in turn suggested that they originated from some other source. I turned to the college and notified you in person.

The metallic particles that fell in New Haven do not appear to be attached as flakes or in the same manner as those which fell at Woodbridge, and within this circle were several "splinters" of the metallic material with the same distinctive outer surface as that of the main particle body. The inner material, however, is brown and powdery, rather than metallic in appearance. The larger particles show evidence of having been burned or melted at some recent time since the discovery. Mrs. Brown has asked that I give you this additional information, and I trust it will be helpful in your continued study of this material.

to yourself in Washington. It is difficult to assess the amount lost by flaking cores as the particles immediately. Dr. Horan assured me that the material would not have lost material upon reanalyzing it from the main mass of samples or flakes which occurred in some further losses of mass by flaking with the slides. It was not possible to place it in any type of container and we were disturbed by the fact that it had to be handled via an analytical process which might lead to further losses of particles or flakes from the main mass onto the dish or the enclosing tape.

I had assumed that the particle would be weighed immediately upon receipt and any flaking could have been accounted for in a more reliable situation. In addition it occurred to me that a portion could be cut out to avoid any errors that may be associated with the handling of fragments or encrustation.

The analysis introuges me as does the apparent change in mass. Assuming that some of the changes have been accounted for by making a mistake, it is possible that another principle might be operating? Assuming the particle had been in a "naturalized" condition for a long time and would not have required gravity to establish its structure, it is possible that electrical charge might be operating? I am certain that the effect of absorption and the like will be taken care of in the sealed container weighings.

I trust that some answers to this intriguing puzzle may soon be forthcoming.

Sincerely yours,

SUBJECT: "Woodridge" - fall of suspected gravitationally oriented material

Dear Professor Brown:

Thank you for your letter of October 28, 1960, and the additional information concerning the "Woodridge" fall of suspected gravitationally oriented material which you wrote to me about. I appreciate your concern in bringing this matter to my attention.

This subject has not yet been physically examined, and I regret that the equipment required for a more comprehensive investigation is not currently available. However, I will endeavor to keep you informed as matters develop.

We are confronted with the apparent fact that material has fallen from the sky which does not conform to any commonly recognized meteorological or accidental processes. Even though this material may prove to be of natural origin, the implications are nonetheless significant if it is found to be of extraterrestrial derivation. I would urge that the utmost discretion be exercised, both in the handling of physical specimens and in the dissemination of information, until the matter can be more thoroughly explored.

The continuing changes in patterns of behavior, as exemplified by the recent activity at "Woodridge", is particularly perplexing. These may, in fact, represent a part of a larger pattern of activity not yet fully understood. It is my belief that a thorough, objective study of all available evidence is essential if we are to eliminate the possibility of a technological advance by an intelligence not of this earth.

In reading your letter, there are certain questions or areas of inquiry which occur to me, and I would appreciate your views on these matters.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Letter to Professor Stuart L. Brown--October 26, 1960

1. Where was the date of the incident rude to? Perhaps you covered this in a telephone conversation, but I have no record of it. I note that you inform me that the incident probably took place in the vicinity of Seymour, Connecticut, on April 18, 1960.

2. You mention "splashes of a metallic material" at the area of impact -- what has become of the metal and are samples available to us?

3. You mention that the civilian observers are in definite disagreement as to the wishing on-station, so as to have a formal record of its accuracy and authenticity?

4. When I mentioned the search by radar, I was alluding to the fact that a check of radar data from that period might reveal information of significance -- I asked about this neither in my previous letter nor in our telephone conversation, and I believe I have no record of a reply from you. 

5. I am greatly interested in your thoughts on one oscillating brand in the weight-data -- I cannot be certain that I fully understand the significance of this. While this brand would indicate the presence of some material of an unusual nature, I  would like to know if it might possibly be due to a fluctuation or malfunction rather than to the presence of unusual material.

While we are deeply grateful to Colonel Townsend for furnishing the material over which we have spent some time, I am not certain that we have yet explored to the full this fascinating incident. I sincerely hope that in the course of time it will be possible to have a definite (even if negative) rate of decay, and every effort is being made to utilize this while it is still "hot".

Again, thank you for your kind consideration, and I shall look forward to your visit in the near future.

1. On 3 December 1959 a meeting was held in the office of 3/Gen Le Ballly. Present at the meeting were the following:
3/Gen Le Ballly, SAFOI 
Col Hall, ATIC
Lt Col Metzger, ATIC 
Dr. J. A. Hynek, ATIC Consultant

At this meeting the problem concerning the requirements of the ad hoc committee were discussed. Col Hall outlined in detail the instructions necessary to implement the UFO project at ATIC with the requirements spelled out by the ad hoc committee.

Wednesday, 7 December 1950: 
Lt Col Fry, USAF, presented a radio program (Broadcast Time 12.30-1.00 CST), "The Air Force Story", which was concerned with the Air Force's investigation of UFO's. This program had been coordinated with Col Odarenko and had no direct bearing on the ad hoc committee's requirements.

Captain Ruppelt gave an interview to Bates Lowery, Newsweek Magazine, concerning the Air Force's investigation of UFO's. This interview had been coordinated with Col Odarenko and Capt Ruppelt was instructed not to discuss details beyond those already made public.

J. A. Hynek contacted Capt. Ruppelt at Wright-Patterson requesting information on the "Minnesota Farmer" case. Commander Liken, ATIC, was also interested in this case. This was apparently an observation reported to ATIC via Project Blue Book channels.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
THE ATTITUDE OF THE AIR FORCE WITH
RESPECT TO THE UFO PROBLEM: OFFICIAL
POLICY, PAST AND PRESENT
1. LACK OF A UNIFIED GOVERNMENT POLICY
Since the closing of Project Blue Book, the Air Force has
clearly indicated that it regards the UFO problem as "closed"
in the sense that it no longer considers UFO reports to be a
matter of direct operational concern to the military. This
policy has been publicly stated on a number of occasions by
various Air Force spokesmen. However, it must be emphasized
that this policy represents the attitude of the Air Force
only, and does not necessarily reflect the views of other
government agencies which may still be actively interested in
UFO phenomena.
2. REASONS FOR AIR FORCE POLICY SHIFT
The reasons for the Air Force's apparent change in
attitude toward UFOs can be attributed to several factors:
a. Exhaustion of Investigative Leads
After more than 20 years of intensive UFO investigations
by Project Blue Book and its predecessor projects, the Air
Force concluded that no tangible evidence had been produced
which would alter the scientific community's sceptical
attitude toward the existence of extraterrestrial visitations.
The gradual exhaustion of promising investigative leads and
the Air Force's inability to provide clear-cut explanations
for many UFO reports led the service to conclude that further
investigations were unlikely to yield any startling new
discoveries.
b. Civilian Research and Investigation
With the cessation of Project Blue Book, the emphasis
for UFO research and investigation has shifted to civilian
research groups and individual investigators. The Air Force
apparently feels that this civilian effort, combined with the
large volume of UFO reports now being handled by the National
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program of the Center for UFO
Studies, is adequate to deal with the UFO problem from a
research standpoint.

S U B J E C r: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

1. On 8 September 1960, the undersigned received a telephone call from Mr. Robert R. Reed, 205 Garden Street, Hartford, Connecticut. Mr. Reed reported that on the evening of 7 September 1960, at approximately 7:15 p.m., he observed an unidentified flying object while driving his automobile on Interstate Highway Route 91, in the vicinity of Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

2. Mr. Reed stated that as he was driving northbound on Route 91, he observed a bright light in the sky to the east of his position. He further stated that the object appeared to be stationary, and was brighter than the surrounding stars in the night sky.

3. Mr. Reed reported that he drove to a rest area on Route 91, located approximately two miles south of the Massachusetts-Connecticut state line, in order to observe the object more closely. He stated that upon arriving at the rest area, the object appeared to move in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed, and subsequently disappeared from view.

4. Mr. Reed described the object as appearing to be round or oval in shape, and estimated its size to be approximately the same as a full moon. He also stated that the object emitted a steady, brilliant white light.

5. No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained regarding this incident.

SEPTEMBER, 8 1960

HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT

At 3:45 a.m. on the morning of September 8th, 1960, Mrs. Mary Jones of Hartford, Connecticut reported seeing an unusual object in the sky. Mrs. Jones stated that she was awakened by a bright light shining through her bedroom window. Upon looking outside, she observed a large, disc-shaped object hovering approximately 200 feet above the ground. 

The object, which Mrs. Jones described as silver in color, was estimated to be 50-60 feet in diameter. It emitted a pulsating glow and made a faint humming sound. Mrs. Jones watched the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The Hartford Police Department was notified, and officers were dispatched to the scene. However, by the time they arrived, the object had already left the area. No other witnesses were found, and no physical evidence of the incident was recovered.

This case has been classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files. Further investigation did not yield any conclusive explanations for the sighting.

(CONFIDENTIAL) DOCUMENT

1. On 8 September 1960, Mrs. John P. Jones, of 12 High Street, Hartford, Connecticut, reported to the Hartford Police Department that she had seen an unusual object in the sky over her home at approximately 6:00 P.M. that evening.

2. According to Mrs. Jones' statement, the object was a metallic, circular craft approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of about 1,000-1,500 feet. The object made no sound and was observed for a period of approximately 5-10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared in a northeasterly direction.

3. The local police department and the Air Force's Project "Blue Book" were notified of the sighting. An investigation was immediately initiated.

4. Upon arriving at the scene, officers from the Hartford Police Department interviewed Mrs. Jones and obtained a written statement from her. Mrs. Jones appeared to be credible and her account of the incident was deemed reliable.

5. No other witnesses to the event were found in the immediate vicinity. A search of the area revealed no physical evidence or residue that could be attributed to the reported object.

6. Project "Blue Book" analysts examined the case and concluded that there was insufficient data to determine the nature of the reported object. The case was classified as "UNIDENTIFIED".

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the analysis of carbonaceous samples related to a UFO incident. The text includes details about the composition and characteristics of different types of samples, as well as observations and analysis of the samples.

The text in the document is as follows:

The numerical sequence was obtained to avoid possible confusion with the sample materials.

As can be seen, the 11 segments can be put into 5 groups:

1. carbonaceous
2. high-metallic (aluminum)
3. stony
4. slag

Of these, the slag seems certain to be of Hartford origin, the stony and high-metallic are also probably the same, the carbonaceous, however, do not seem clearly due to the observed fall, and, therefore, the most time was spent in their analysis.

Analysis of carbonaceous samples

The carbonaceous samples are 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9 and the 11 "black light ball" are very similar in composition. They look like coal, and the Geiger counter showed a high count, indicating they are highly radioactive. Sample 5 (coalish, mounted with white-coated side toward the background sample) when compared with the background sample 10 and 11 shows large differences, namely that it contains large amounts of Sr (up to 10% by wt.), Ba (over 1% by wt.), and long- lived radioactive elements. The heights of the major order peaks are as follows: using a 1/4 crystal and 1/8 source aperture at 19 KV and 10 ma.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a document or report discussing the analysis of a flight metallic sample.

Analysis of flight metallic samples
Sample No. 2 - X-ray fluorescence analysis:
A semi-quantitative analysis of 43 mg* area on the sample was compared to all three standards. The spectrometer was aligned for the Al K, line, and the intensities of the elements present were suppressed by pulse height selection so that the intensity from the sample to Aluminum 0.28 was indicating a large proportion of Aluminum in the sample.
A standard was prepared having Magnesium, Aluminum and Barium in the following ratio:
Mg = .48, Al =.51
From the relative intensities of the Mg K, Al K, and Ba L, lines, it was determined that the indicated proportions were: 
9.91 Mg and 9.96 Al
However, the Ba K : Ba L ratio from the standard was 19 times that from the sample, indicating a strong surface segregation of Ba in the sample. Therefore, the Ba L-line contains a possible surface contamination, and assume that the Mg and Al are uniformly distributed, we obtain the estimate of:
30% Aluminum
1% Magnesium 
10% Barium

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an analysis report with a table showing the composition percentages of various elements in a sample. There is no human face visible in the image.

The text in the document is as follows:

However, this entire analysis proves only the very thin layer just the surface, and in this layer the proportion of Barium is very high.

A comparison was made between Sample #2 and standard containing the following:

Ba 15.%
Zr 0.6
Sr 2.0 
Fe 4.0
Mn 2.0
Cr 1.5
Ag 90.
Ni 2.

The results indicated that the sample contained all of these elements, with perhaps 1% variation above and below the percentages shown. The proportion of Barium is high because in a analysis of the surface layer.As indicated in the previous section, Aluminum and Titanium also make up part of the specimen.

Without destroying the sample by homo-genizing it, we cannot make any quantitative estimates of analysis by weight. However, the following guesses might be put forward on the basis of the surface layer examination.

Element	Percent Composition
Ba		15.%
Zr		0.6
Sr		2.0
Fe		4.0
Mn		2.0
Cr		1.5
Ag		90.
Ni		2.
