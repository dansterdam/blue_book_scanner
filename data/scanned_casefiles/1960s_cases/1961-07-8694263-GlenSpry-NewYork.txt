Gentlemen:

On the night of July 6, at
10:26 P.M. (New York Time),
E.S.S.D. a flying object,
identified as long and slender
with a red light at the first
followed by two white lights,
was first sighted, due north
traveling northeast covering the
area on approximately three
minutes.

It was located, first,
between the pointer stars of
the big dipper and the north
star, at a direction of N-NE 45°
traveled below the north star.

Here is the text from the document:

that was lost sighted at a
northeast direction heading
north west. Enclosed we diagram
reproducing to the best of our
ability, the travel of this craft.
Please send us, at your earliest
convenience, all information you
have pertaining to this object
to give knowledge this was
not an airplane, since in this
location there are not many
planes and this was flying too
high for a commercial craft.

Sincerely,

[The signature is blacked out]
