UFO Observations, 31 Jul 67 and 6 Sep 67

See Attached List for Addressees

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of two different unidentified flying objects from the Indianapolis area.

2. On the evening of 31 July 1967, one observer saw an object, that then hovered described by ordinary objects, looked like two connected white illuminated rolls of toilet tissue. These were connected so that when looking at the object, from directly underneath, it would look similar to the end of a pair of binoculars.

3. We also received a report from the morning of 6 September 1967 in which another observer sighted a white saucer shaped craft that was flat on the top and bottom.

4. If you were in the area on or about these days, or if you know what any have been the cause for the sightings, we would appreciate your letting us know.

5. Thank you for any assistance that you can provide in helping us to solve these two cases.
