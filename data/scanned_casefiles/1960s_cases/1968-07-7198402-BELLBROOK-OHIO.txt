What I saw was: A craft
that could remain completely
motionless in the air, thus being
able to remain still to make
pictures. wt is shaped like
a child's top. wt gets at a
far greater speed than any
yet. Completely silent. cat
can come straight down
or go straight up. not
taking off like an airplane.
wt is white in color; in
some instance looking not
unlike a cloud.
