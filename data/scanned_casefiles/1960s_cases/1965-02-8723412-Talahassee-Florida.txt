SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Report

TO: Foreign Technology Division (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. A follow-up investigation was conducted at 0100Z to 0500Z hours, 10 Feb 65, at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Fla. Prior to the designated time, the Dean of Students at FSU, a Mr. Arnold, was contacted for assistance in arranging for the presence of all known and available witnesses, in the college ballroom. Mr. Arnold was highly cooperative, and in fact, inserted a prominent notice in the college newspaper notifying the students of the time and place of the proposed interviews and urging personnel who witnessed the UFO to appear. In addition, local radio and television stations informed the public via spot news bulletins that Air Force investigators were in the area and desired to interview all individuals who could furnish information about the UFO.

2. In spite of the ample means of notification, only one student, Mr. [redacted] appeared for interview. His testimony appeared to be sincere and reliable; his description of the UFO was that of the classic "flying saucer" as depicted in movies, TV, etc. Another alleged witness, Miss [redacted], was contacted by telephone. She declined to appear personally (although she lived only two blocks from the ballroom), but consented to furnish the requested information via phone. Her description approximated that of [redacted] in most respects. Her manner, however, was rather flippant, and thus unconvincing. I would be inclined to place less credence in her story than in Mr. [redacted].

3. Attempts were made to contact other witnesses listed in the original message. One source contained a fraudulent address and telephone number. Another was at work and his mother advised he would be home shortly and she would send him over to be interviewed; but that individual did not put in an appearance. All other efforts to locate witnesses and secure statements were unsuccessful.


- page 3 -

4. In view of the very limited response to our requests for infor-
mation, one receives the very definite impression that the numerous
students who allegedly saw the UFO are reluctant to verify their
original statements. Since the UFO was supposedly observed in a
college area and mostly by college students, there is a good possi-
bility that the entire incident was a hoax of some sort. Otherwise,
it seems likely that more witnesses would have come forward with
information in an official investigation.

5. Because both witnesses who were contacted stated that the
object was travelling from West to East, the connection with the
sightings by the pilot of Eastern Air Lines and by the Tower Opera-
tor at Jacksonville, Fla, cannot be completely discarded. However,
there is at this time, no compelling evidence linking the sightings
in the other areas to the UFO allegedly seen in the Tallahassee area.

6. Tyndall and Eglin AFB's reported negative activity of any type
in, or near, the vicinity of Tallahassee, Fla, at the time of the
UFO sighting.

7. This evidence thus far is deemed as very unsatisfactory, vague,
and inconclusive. In the absence of subpoena powers, it would
appear that further attempts to secure statements from alleged
witnesses would be fruitless, and that the results would not justify
the manhours and expenses involved. It is felt that any attempts
of identification would be pure conjecture, and would be of no pro-
bative value. Therefore, it is recommended that this investigation
be closed.

Dear Sir:

The Air Force is conducting an investigation of an unidentified flying object reported on the night of 1 February 1965 in the Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Florida area.

We are attaching a self-addressed envelope for convenience in replying.

Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge your letter of March 8, 1965, received in this office on March 15, 1965, in regards to your request for information from EAL crew Flight 661 regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object, reported on the night of February 1, 1965, in the Tallahassee, Jacksonville area.

We have contacted the crew of our Flight 661 and they state they were not cognizant of any such flying object. EAL Trip originates Philadelphia and leaves there at 11:30 A.M.

It is our belief that you must have been given the wrong EAL trip number in this instance.

I am sorry we were unable to help in this instance. If there is anything further we can do, please advise.

Very truly yours,

M/R:  3 Feb 65

At 1500, 3 Feb 65 Major Jacks called Sgt Jones and wanted to know if we received a message from Tyndall AFB, Florida relating to a UFO sighting over Jacksonville and I said no, he told me to call Tyndall to find out what it was or what action they were taking on it.

At 1510 I called Tyndall and the Operations said they sent it to the Command Post, in turn. I called Command Post and they said they sent it to the Section at Gunther. Called the section and spoke to a sergeant who said he would find out all information about this sighting and call us back. When talking with Major Jacks office called and wanted to know what I had found out. Told them Tyndall sent it on to without taking any action. She said to call them back and tell that in accordance with AFR 200-2 they are responsible for the investigation.

At 1615 recalled Tyndall and spoke to Capt Harshburger who said to call the Commander of the Command Post, he transferred my call to that office. Spoke with Lt Col Middleton, he said it was up to the discretion of the Commander if he wanted to make the investigation or not, and he would think about it, I replied to him that Major Jacks office wants to know what action was being taken on it before closing time. He said he would call Maj Jacks himself. I then called SAFOI and told Sara that the Colonel was going to call her before quiting time.

At 1625 NORAD called me back and CMSgt Whitman from NORAD (32nd Region) read the message to me which had been sent to them from Tyndall. Whitman said he didn't feel that it was there responsibility to take the action since Tyndall sent them the message and about 9 other stations received it before them. Whitman said that on the same day that they received the message they informed Tyndall that Tyndall should make the investigation. I (Sgt Jones) do not know what Tyndall's


- page 12 -

reply was. Sgt Whittman did not know who had told Tyndall that they were to take the action but he had heard from 3 others that someone had told Tyndall to take the action. Sgt Jones told Whittman that it wasn't his responsibility and we would get Tyndall to send us a copy of the message.

At approximately 1400 hrs wfos we phoned
Sgt Maddox as he was not fixed
to date. He said Major Chambers was
conducting an investigation in accord
with AFR 200-2. Rpt would go out
in priority message by 6pm tonight.

On 5 Feb 65, Safos received their copy
of message. We have not -
