The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, with information about a sighting of an unidentified flying object on 13 Sep 63 at a location near Hawaii. The information includes details about the sighting, the type of observation, and the conclusions made about the object. The text in the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 13 Sep 63
2. LOCATION: 24-30N 150W (PACIFIC)
3. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 10 minutes
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: D Ground-Visual
5. DESCRIPTION: Bright light like Chrome finish; at times seemed to glow or flash on and off; approximately 1/3 the size of the moon in apparent diameter; Stationary on or near the horizon.
6. COURSE: Not reported
7. NAVIGATOR REMARKS: Star-like in Dipper handle.
10. DETAIL OF INTERPRETATION: AS GS3 ECHO would have been at about 52 deg South and moving NE at a logical speed. This is CO deg below reported observation. However, since object was reported as stationary on or near the horizon, it is probably in that category.
11. CONCLUSIONS: Was Natural
Was Familiar Aircraft
Was Astronomical
Was Satellite
Was Insufficient Data for Evaluation
