MEMORANDUM

IDPT/UFO:

This is a PR gesture. Guess we're obligated
to look at it. Nothing is said in the ground rules
about kid reporting UFOs.

If you'll let me know what you decide, I'll
know.

WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

1 JUL 1969

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter postmarked June 27, in which you requested evaluations of two unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

In order for Project Blue Book to investigate a UFO sighting, the observer must report it directly to the Air Force; we do not accept secondhand reports for investigation. In addition, we have found that after a sighting is over thirty days old, precise details become blurred in the viewer's mind and an investigation is not then worthwhile. For these reasons, we cannot investigate your friend's report. We thought that perhaps he might want this report for his records. So we are returning it. Enclosed is some material on UFOs; by looking at the different categories of objects often reported as UFOs, you may be able to help him identify his sighting.

The 1969 Project Blue Book has not been published. However, we anticipate no changes in the 1968 edition except in the statistical summary. You may bring your 1968 edition up-to-date by inserting the enclosed sheets at pages 8 and 9.

The report of your sighting is being sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. As soon as it is evaluated, you will be notified.

Sincerely,
/s/

UFO Observation, 26 Jun 1969

[Redacted address]
Jacksonville, Florida 22216

Reference your UFO sighting of 26 Jun 69. On the basis of description, we feel that the stimulus for your sighting was probably a satellite. There are over 1,700 objects in space, approximately 1% of which are visible to the naked eye. Although we are unable to identify which object you sighted, we feel that your sighting was of one of these "naked eye" satellites.

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU FIRST NOTICED THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
