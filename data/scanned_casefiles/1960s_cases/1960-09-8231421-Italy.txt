1. A positive identification of the objects which appear in these three photo prints is not possible with the limited information furnished.

2. It is suggested that the negatives of these photographs be obtained from the sources if possible, and also that more details concerning the conditions under which the pictures were taken be given. Were pictures taken through a window glass? Inside a building? Were the inside lights on? Were they taken from an automobile?

3. The two photographs dated 26 Sep 60 show three images which cannot be explained from photo analysis. It is stated in the letter dated 29 Sep 60 that the diameter of these objects is about 15 meters and focused on infinity. The objects are out of focus which could mean either that they are very small and close to the camera or moving very rapidly. It is possible that either the negative or original print could be retouched since the intensity of the dark objects is much greater than the other areas on these prints.

Evaluation of Source Reliability Unreliable

Analysis and Conclusions: The prints was submitted to photo analysis. The information reported is too meagre to allow a valid conclusion. The analyst states that the objects are either very small and close folkx the camera or moving rapidly due to their being out of focus. They also state that due to the objects being much x darker than the other dark areas, it is possible that the negative or original print was retouched. In one print, the objects size increased, indicating that they were closer to the camera than in the other print. However, the other objects in the print also increased in size, indicating that the camera was moved toward the background. Also in this print the background appears to be overexposed, but the objects are just as dark as in the other print. These prints are probably the result of someone attempting to perpetrate a hoax.

There is no legible text in this image. The photograph appears to show three UFO-like objects in the sky above a landscape with trees, a fence, and some buildings in the background. The image is in black and white and seems to be from an old UFO report document.
