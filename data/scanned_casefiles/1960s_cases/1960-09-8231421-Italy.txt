ATTN OF: AFCIN-4E2x

SUBJECT: Request for Photoanalysis

TO: AFCIN-4D4a

1. Attached is a photograph of an alleged UFO with a copy of accompanying letter from "RICHARD R. SHOOP OFFICER, USAF AFCIN-4E2x" dated 22 September 1960.

2. Request photoanalysis be made of these photographs.

1. A positive identification of the objects which appear in these three photo prints is not possible with the limited information furnished.

2. It is suggested that the negatives of these photographs be obtained if possible, and also that more details concerning the conditions under which the pictures were taken be given. Were the pictures taken through a window? Were the inside lights on? Were the photographs taken from an automobile?

3. The two photographs dated 26 Sep 60 show three images which cannot be explained from the analysis. It is stated in the letter dated 22 Sep 60 that the diameter of the object is such as to make it impossible to see more than a small and close to the camera or moving very rapidly. It is possible that the original print could be retouched since the intensity of the dark objects is much greater than the other dark areas on these prints.

Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: Fogs acft, but cannot conclude.
Other: Probably a hoax.
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Unreliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The prints was submitted to photo analysis. The information reported is too meager to allow a valid conclusion. The analyst states that the objects are either very small and close to the camera or large and distant. They appear to be quite dark compared to the other dark areas. It is possible that the negative or original print is underexposed. In one print, the objects size increased, indicating that they were closer to the camera than in the other print. However, the other objects in the print also increased in size, suggesting this was due to the objects being closer to the camera. The background appears to be overexposed, but the objects are just as dark as in the other print. These prints are probably the result of someone attempting to perpetrate a hoax.
