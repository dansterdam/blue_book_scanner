The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document with handwritten text. The text is partially obscured by redaction.

I shall now attempt to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text visible in the image:

Dear Sir
I noticed a strange light in the sky a few nights ago about 8:30 PM. It was traveling in a slow and erratic manner at an altitude of about 500 feet and seemed to be about 50 yards wide. The light was reddish orange in color and would disappear and reappear at irregular intervals. There was a bright white light in the center of the object. The object was visible for approximately 10-15 minutes before disappearing. I would appreciate if you would investigate this matter.
Sincerely yours
