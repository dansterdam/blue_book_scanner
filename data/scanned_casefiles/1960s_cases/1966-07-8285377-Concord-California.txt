The object moved in a horizontal direction at a fairly high speed & was round or circular in shape.
It appeared to be metallic or silvery in color. There was no trail or vapor visible. It appeared to be either a

The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a horizon line, with an object above it at various angles (0°, 15°, 30°, etc.). There is also a compass rose at the bottom of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the curve to show where the object entered the path, and a "B" or the end of the path, and place an arrow to show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 January 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point of interrogation or a narrative exposition of your statement:
To the nearest eye it appear that a tall - fairly light colored object with a circular or at least rounded shape of considerable size was observed in the sky in the late afternoon while performing ordinary household chores. It was moving rapidly across the sky in a horizontal direction, maintaining its shape and size in a steady fashion untill briefly seen by another person in the near vicinity. No sounds were heard and no visible efforts were made to affect the object or determine its nature and origin. Some consideration is shown about the event leading to the discovery of definite conclusions as to what has been observed other than for general speculation and theorizing on the subject of unidentified flying objects.
