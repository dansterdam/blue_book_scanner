On page one and two of the form is place the witness is and certain information, it may have mentioned it where it says "place" if it was A B" on line " .. " it is not what I want to convey. Anyway after spending considerable time analyzing all of this I must confess that I have done wrong.

I find that I do not have the information necessary nor the time to devote to them. One or more of them Dr. Pagliaro and some other fellows from WSU (perhaps "UFO") say I am a quack and my findings are useless. However, it might be best if you do not send me any more of these things for the time being. I thought it was best to return the one I had. As in the past, I have written up some suggestions, but I have tried to indicate why I feel I cannot handle these matters. I am returning BF's written material as it is not up to standard and I have done every thing I can to help in this matter.

Transcribing the text from the document:

Page 4, 24.
If you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, indicate the direction you were moving. (Circle One) 24.1 What direction were you moving? Northeast southwest Southeast E. Northwest
24.2 How fast were you moving? miles per hour? 24.3 Did you stop at any time while you were looking at the object? (Circle One) Yes No

25. Did you observe the object through any of the following?
a. Eyeglasses Yes No c. Binoculars Yes No
b. Sun glasses Yes No d. Telescope Yes No
c. Windshield Yes No e. Sighting device Yes No
d. Airplane window glass Yes No f. Other

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, indicate by a sketch or diagram, the direction from which the object appeared and approached, the direction it took in leaving, and any change in elevation or direction during the observation, and the apparent size of the object with respect to some known object as the moon or a dime at arm's length, in relation to the apparent size of the object which you saw.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point showed by the X. The lines curved will show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an X on the compass when you first saw it, and an O on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Indicate the beginning of the path, the ending of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
