The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some instructions for a UFO report document. The diagram appears to depict a curved horizon line with various angle markings, as well as a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a scenario where they are at a certain point and describe the position and height of an observed object above the horizon.

Text in the document:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
