Widely seen UFO in Calif.

On the morning of 5 September 1963, a fast-moving UFO was reported over Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Records from the Sheriffs offices in the above-mentioned counties received twenty reports. Some of the details given by witnesses were as follows: "A half moon pulsating object," a circular object lighted from the top to bottom, the light, which appeared to turn off and on was visible intermittently. The Federal Aviation Agency, when queried, was unable to account for the UFO.
