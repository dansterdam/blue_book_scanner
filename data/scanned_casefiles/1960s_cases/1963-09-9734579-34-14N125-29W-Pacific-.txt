Widely Seen UFO in Calif.

Shortly after 4:00 a. m., on the morning of 25 September 1963, a fast-moving UFO was reported over Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Reports came in from the town of Woodside and San Jose also. Sheriff's offices in the above-mentioned counties received twenty reports. Some descriptions given by witnesses were as follows: "A half moon pulsating object," a "circular object lighted from the interior." The light, while appeared to turn off and on was visible intermittently.

The Federal Aviation Agency, when queried, was unable to account for the UFO.
