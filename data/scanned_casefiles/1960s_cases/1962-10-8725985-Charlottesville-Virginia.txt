PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 6 October 1962
2. LOCATION: Charlottesville, Virginia
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 6 October 1962 
4. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 3-4 minutes
5. PHOTOS: O Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-4 minutes 
7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Yellowish-white color, circular moving in straight line at constant rate, 5-10 seconds, no sound, no smoke, no trail, no change in shape, this time with & without BX. Disappeared 4 seconds later.
11. COMMENTS: Satellite ECHO 1 over Virginia at 10:42 pm. This places ECHO in possible exact location to be observed by witness. Satellites they often appear to move at constant rate, seemingly for certain duration, and disappear. This is attributed to atmospheric conditions & witness's own optical capabilities when object approaches and when it disappears.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads as follows:

To whom it may concern:

This is a report of an unidentified flying object. At 8:55 p.m. on October 6, 1962 I observed a source of light in the sky exhibiting peculiar behavior. I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia and I was frequently in this area on that date. On the night of Oct. 6, I had a pair of 7X50 binoculars at my disposal.

While I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia as a landmark, I suddenly noticed a very bright white light in the sky which appeared to be as bright as Sirius but slightly yellower in color. It was moving toward Lacerta, a small constellation above the North Star. This light moved in a straight line and then appeared to be as bright as Sirius but slightly yellower in color.

This star was moving toward Lacerta, a small constellation above the North Star. It then made a sharp turn and moved at a much faster speed westward. It appeared as a point source of light through the 7X50 binoculars, however it still appeared as a point source of light even at maximum magnification. Based on this I judged the object to be some distance away. It moved across the sky and came to a stop and remained stationary for about 30 seconds. I then lost sight of it as it moved behind some trees.

In conclusion, I am at a loss to explain the phenomena with which I was confronted. I have carefully considered the contents. The conclusions that good judgment will be executed on its contents.

I am unable to avoid any confusion as to the purpose of this letter or the nature of the object observed. There are no witnesses to my observation. Enclosed is a rough map of the area in the sky where the object occurred and a path designating the path of the object.

In order to avoid any confusion as to the purpose of this letter, I remain:

Anonymously Yours,
U.Va., Charlottesville, Va.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn diagram or sketch depicting an astronomical observation. It contains various labels and annotations, such as "Constellation Laeerta", "Scheller", "Constellation Constellation", and "Punlable". The diagram seems to illustrate the movement or path of an unidentified object, with annotations describing its behavior and characteristics.
