Light source in sky yellowish, color
of Saturn, though to be satellite
moving in straight line at constant
velocity. Came to stop for 30 seconds
& remained stationary. Visible at
this time with & without BX. Disap-
peared 4 seconds later.

one

11. COMMENTS
Satellite ECHO I over Virginia
at 71 dgr elevation to the NE
at 842 pm. This places ECHO in
position to be observed by the
witness. During observation
satellites they often appear to
remain stationary for certain
periods & wave in their path.
This is attributed to atmospheric
conditions & witness's own optical conditions. This is particularly true when obj approaches
a star or other body

To whom it may concern:

This is a report of an unidentified flying object.

At 8:55 p.m. on the night of October 6, 1962 I observed a source of light in the sky exhibiting peculiar behavior.

I am a graduate engineering student at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia and I am frequently pursuing my hobby of astronomy. I spend many hours observing the sky and I am quite familiar with the various things that one would expect to find there. On the night of Oct. 6, I had a pair of 7X50 binoculars at my command.

While I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia as a landmark so I could find the great spiral nebula in Andromeda, I observed a "star" directly adjacent to the actual star Schedar in Cassiopeia. This star appeared to be as bright as Schedar but slightly yellower in color. It was the approximate color of Saturn.

This star was moving toward Lacerta, a small constellation above Cassiopeia at the time of the observation. Thinking that it was an artificial satellite I tried to pick up more detail in my 7X50 binoculars. However it still appeared as a point source of light moving at constant velocity in a straight line. At this time I judged it to be an artificial satellite. However after some 15 degrees through the sky it came to a stop and remained stationary for about 30 seconds. At this time I observed it very carefully for I was very curious. I saw it both with and without the binoculars and will quite sure that it was a star. Its color assured me that I was not mistaken, observing a star satellite. Then the peculiar yellow star proceeded to disappear and did so in about 4 seconds. I cannot explain this 1 term of the phenomena with a familiar so I am bringing it to the attention of the recipient of this letter in the hopes that good judgment will be executed on its contents.

The observation was made from the statue of Thomas Jefferson on the "Lawn" of the University grounds. There are no witnesses to my observation. Enclosed is a rough map of the area in the sky where the object occurred and a path designating the path of the object.

In order to avoid any confusion as to the purpose of this letter I remain:

Anonymously Yours,
U.V., Charlottesville, Va.
