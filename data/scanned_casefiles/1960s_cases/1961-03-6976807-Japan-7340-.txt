The image appears to be a blank page with text at the top. The text reads:

File 7340
March 31, 1961
Japan
2 photos

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present on this page.

- page 1 -

The image contains a black and white photograph of a cityscape, likely a skyline of a city. There appears to be a round object in the sky above the buildings, which could potentially be a UFO or some other unidentified aerial phenomenon. However, the quality of the image is quite poor, making it difficult to discern any clear details about the object.

Based on the context provided, this appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report from 1961 regarding a UFO sighting in Japan.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text from the document:
