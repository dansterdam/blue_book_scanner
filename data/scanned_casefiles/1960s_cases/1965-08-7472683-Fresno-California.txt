Dear Mr. Secretary:

Enclosed is a copy of a letter addressed to me by
my good friend and constituent, Mr. Violet of Fresno, California, concerning an
unidentified object viewed by Mr. Violet and his family on the night of August 8, 1965. I
have suggested to him that he and his family may
have been looking at a planet, but I am not
familiar with the location of the planets on this
night at the hours mentioned.

As the Air Force is responsible for the investigation of phenomena of this nature, I would
welcome comments which I can convey to my constituent. I know you to be a most responsible attorney and businessman, and I have no doubt he has
accurately described his observations.

Sincerely,
[Signature of B. F. Sisk]

Dear Bernie:

This letter is merely for the purpose of allowing you based on your knowledge of the reports that have been coming out on unidentified flying objects.

At approximately 11:45 last night my fourteen year old son, having just returned from work at the Broken Bit, had gone to bed and was just dozing off in Oakmore, Some five minutes later I went out to talk to him briefly and noticed to the southeast a star which appeared to be unusually red. As much as I called it to his attention and we watched it, it did not appear to move and so passed it off as a satellite. It was moving, thus would be classified as a satellite. The conclusion that it was simply the winking that made it appear unusually red.

At 11:55 David came in the house and said that he had moved something the size of a thumb and was mistaken and was prepared to kid him about his imagination getting the best of him but he did so and, look, it had moved as if it was no longer visible where we had first seen it. My wife, Betty, came to see what we were doing and the observation was made that it was an ordinary satellite during the past few occasions. As we have observed on several previous occasions during the past years, however, as far we know, I did see my dear rifle which has a Kassfeld telescopic sight which when set on maximum magnification to nine power

Upon observing the star or satellite thusly it became immediately apparent that it was nothing such as we had ever seen before. At 1:00 o'clock, as we viewed it, all of the following were seen: At the right, side of the object, hereafter described was the face of a clock, at 1:00 o'clock, a point. It was two-thirds of the star itself, almost boundary. The dark was dark to yellow to white in color. It appeared to vary from a dark space between 2:00 and 3:00; there was a dark red flow, and blue and red streaks of light, blue-green much further in length. All this was seemed to pulse, every so often but in color. All this lights and red glow would become dominant about every ten seconds. The maintained the blue-green color and encroach upon the blue-green area. We came across other and several other satellites that we have observed before. Finally disappearing to our eyes.

You have undoubtedly seen publicity concerning vicious sightings here in the valley during the past month or six weeks. I have no idea what we observed but felt that, knowing me and my family, you would be interested in having this report and would know what to do with it.

With best personal regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

DCPEK
