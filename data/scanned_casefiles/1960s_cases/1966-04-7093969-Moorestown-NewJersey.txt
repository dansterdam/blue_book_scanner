Gentlemen:

On March 31, 1966 at approximately 8:45 P.M., I was taking down our trash cans. I looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be an airplane. It had a giant red light on the tail end. To the made no sound whatever. It was headed north to south. After I checked my watch I realized I was looking at it at 8:30. I then used all direct lines. One time I went to you asking for information. You sent me Blue Book 1 January 1966. I so read this. After a few seconds a plane was in the area. I couldn't tell where it was. The duration of my sighting was only about 30 seconds. The object was traveling slow, it was low, made no noise, and it was not a helicopter. The way it flew told me this. At one time it seemed to dim the red light and I could see several clear points in the bottom. They were two scars. Then the red light seemed to "engulf" the "thing" as it went off. The object was about 60 feet wide and the red light diminished. I am the clear point I saw growing lights. This will be the only thing that you are interested in.

Here is the text from the document:

Solid object, Maybe + the sun in complete or to at it
to bear. What I saw that night wasn't anything I could
recognize. This is not Cupid fools!!!

I hope my report was clear enough so that you
can get an evaluation. Here are some statistics about
it in summary form:
1. Direction - north-to-south
2. Speed - about 30 mph.
3. Height - 100 ft
4. Area - Moorestown, New Jersey
over my home.
5. Time - 8:45 P.M.
6. Size - 60 feet across (diameter)

Probably dim saucer.

Sincerely,

(P.S. What did I see? All the guys are calling me "highball" be
cause it's flying saucers!)
