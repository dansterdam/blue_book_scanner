[Handwritten note on the side of the first sketch]: I really don't believe they were doing lower as the alignment to have such motion from different angle as they left.

I can't say definitely what they were. I began to wonder if they were satellites or something else. It was definitely not a meteor. I wonder if they were from the U.S.A. or Russia, or something else. I wondered then.

The were in the backyard and were looking up at a low-flying airplane when we noticed way overhead this metallic shiny object which came out of the southeast and disappeared in three minutes in the northwest. It rotated in a straight path, and then I noticed a second one, when the first tipped on its side and veered off to the northwest. They disappeared very suddenly together. There was no sound; it was a very steady, constant shape, no wind. It estimates they were very high, and yet, we

could see the whirling, or rotating motion, saw it move steadily on. As it rotated, it reflected the bright sun, and "sparkled". Three other persons viewed (age 10 & 7) and (age 7). They see have the same descriptions. The centers were thicker than the edges.

They were clear to me, and to the children, and not foggy. I wish I could remember the direction of the rotation, but can't. (I think clockwise, but am not sure)

They resembled 50¢ pieces, tops, spinning, revolves with a funnel through the hole, complete with a "lamp". or more. Take your pick. Of course, the angle viewed changed the total appearance.

The rotating motion & quick disappearance are the two things that impressed me most.

I see never put too much faith in those reporting before, but one not a doubting Thomas any more!

Dear Sirs:

It arrived 3:45 P.M. on Thursday on July 28th and were outside in the backyard and an airplane came over. We all looked up. My wife of 51 yrs. old. saw said "what is that?" We all looked up again, and high in the sky, very high, saw the ground, shiny, metallic. It was object height in a straight path from southwest to northeast.

It was thick in the middle, I noticed, as it turned at a different angle, before going out of sight. Incidentally, it was disappearing, another one appeared.

Dear Sir,

At around 8:45 PM on Thursday Aug. 25 we were outside in the back yard and an apple tree came over, very low, and as we all looked up my Tyler-old son said "What's that?" We all looked up again, and saw this round, shiny metal-like light going so straight past from southeast to the northwest.

We spent about 3 minutes as well as we could in the middle, I noticed as it turned at 8 different angles - before going out of sight. Incidentally, just before it disappeared, another one appeared to blow at it, rather to it. -
