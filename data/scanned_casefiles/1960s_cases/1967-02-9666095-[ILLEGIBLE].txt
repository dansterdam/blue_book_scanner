LAWRENCE EAGLE TRIBUNE
Switchboard operator received calls on a UFO that evening but no names and addresses available - may have referred to a pair of searchlights originating from a new super-market and connected with UFO sighting in question.

ADDITIONAL WITNESSES
Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] Street, Lawrence may have seen the same craft about 45 minutes later at approximately 7:45 PM. They were proceeding South on Route #93 when they noticed a loose cluster of 8-9 red, green, and white lights at a low altitude and very slow speed. A bright white light was noticed at the bottom of the cluster. The number of lights, the fact that they were not flashing off and on, the slow speed and abnormally-low altitude puzzled [REDACTED].

Rt. #93 about 1 1/4-1/2 mile ahead of them traveling in a SW-NE direction. Mr. [REDACTED] though he heard what sounded like a light plane's engine so dismissed it as a conventional aircraft with special lights. He was still puzzled enough to report it to me. He is a fellow Sylvania employee at the Applied Research Lab in Waltham. He is an electrical engineer.

EVALUATION

There is only one aircraft in the area bearing even the slightest resemblance to the craft reported - The East Coast Advertising Co.'s "sky-lize" advertising plane. It is a Tri-Pacer cub with an illuminated sign. However, it was not airborne on this date.

Normally, I would have written this sighting off as a case of mistaken identity and evaluated the sighting as probable helicopter but there is enough about the sighting that does not correspond to a conventional helicopter to warrant my sending a full report to NICAP.

1. The witness is familiar with aircraft. He works for "Flying Tigers". At first he thought the object was a helicopter but a close look at it changed his mind. Whatever it was frightened him.

2. There was no noise although the witness passed almost directly under the object with his head out the window. I see and hear helicopters regularly on a busy highway with my windows closed. They make a racket.

3. The craft did not have conventional running lights.

4. The craft carried unusual and unconventional floodlight-type lights.

5. The craft hovered dangerously low over a main highway.

6. There was no sign of propulsion visible.

I was outside during these miles. I noticed the sky darkening and moving toward the west of me. I thought I saw an unusual and weird scene. It was able to see while actually the whole sky appeared to stop and hold the sky and at that time I felt the sky light at of just was one, in the house to have any sign of trouble. It was and that time as I was the second object fly to the sun I did so. It was my high wide of speed and a very low altitude. The then pattern the 2nd object came from what we thought is from fighting 2 or 3 miles wide of people about 20 miles. It was object we figured into 20 miles 15 to 20 miles wide of any. Compared to be faster. Tell sky it was from the sun to looking right

Report of Investigation

Mr. [REDACTED]

Having called and obtained permission to visit, I interviewed Mr. [REDACTED] between the hours of 10:30 and 11:45 A.M. on 19 February 1967, at his home, [REDACTED] St., Methuen, Mass.

To support the rather terse answers on the NICAP Form, the following information was offered:

Mr. [REDACTED] was driving home from work on Route 93, northbound on the 17th of February, 1967. He is, as he describes himself, "a creature of habit", and was listening to his usual news and sports programs on the car radio, thereafter he was able to pinpoint the time of sighting at 6:55 P.M., plus or minus one minute. As he proceeded along Route 93, his car crested a rise in the road and he saw a bright object ahead which appeared to be hanging motionless over the road. Approaching, he took his foot off the accelerator and allowed his vehicle to slow from 65 mph to about 50 mph. Drawing closer, he saw what appeared to be a rectangular or extremely bright lights. Still closer, he could see a bright green frame, Vee-shaped, extended from the object, and from the other end he became aware of a flashing red light which was evidently shielded so that it was not visible until quite close to the object. The UFO was completely motionless, hanging over Route 93.

According to Mr. [REDACTED], the size of it was such that if there were to be a large, it would have completely blocked the Northbound lane of 93 and the green frame would have extended into the highway's median strip.

Prompted by my question about its light intensity, he indicated it was as bright as an array of floodlights like those used with home movie cameras. "Dazzling brilliance" He indicated further that the highway was not lighting the stretch of road, but the object overcast flood-lit the highway. As he slowed his car down to about 40-45 mph, he opened his window and put his head part way out of the window, expecting to hear the sound of a hovering helicopter, but heard no sound except that of his vehicle. Being an employee of an air freight company, he is familiar with aircraft types and sounds, and as the very low altitude of the object, he would have clearly heard a high level of sound if it were a hovering helicopter. He indicated that he saw just large, very bright lights of a "huge" helicopters used in Viet Nam. Still intent on identifying the object as a copter, he looked for a sign of a tail rotor on the green "V" frame, but saw nothing there.

At this point, he became concerned about the object's identity, and admitted that he wanted to pull over and stop to investigate. His sitting, but suddenly "a little afraid of the thing".

He attempted to look up at the lights as he drove under them, but it was now directly above his car and he could neither see nor hear it. He drove thru the brightly lighted stretch of road under the UFO kept looking in his rear view mirrors. After passing under it, and twirling several hundred yards up the highway, he caught a sight of it in his inside rear view mirror. The flashing red light was more pronounced on the north side of the than it was on the approach from the south.

Mr. [REDACTED]

As he drove along, Mr. [REDACTED] saw one car parked at the side of the highway with its parking lights on. Also, a car passed him on the right side, and the occupants of the rear seat of the car were turned around in their seats, watching the object through the car window.

Arriving home, Mr. [REDACTED] phoned the local FAA office to report what he had seen, and he also called a local newspaper office to ask if they had received any reports of the sighting. He did not leave his name with the girl who answered the newspaper office phone, but was told there had been several calls about a UFO near the intersection of Routes 93 and 495.

Mr. [REDACTED]'s wife was present at the interview, but she busied herself making coffee and said nothing about the incident, not even offering a comment. Mr. [REDACTED] appeared to be a stable, well-adjusted individual whose answers and comments were entirely appropriate to the subject situation. Summing up, he is a personable type, a little embarrassed to be involved, but willing to cooperate providing his name is not released to any news media. He offered the information that he had never paid any attention to UFOs, but upon being faced with a UFO situation, he felt that an investigation should be carried on to find out what is going on. He is quite derisive of the "little-green-men" proponents, and the reason he wants no publicity is that he is afraid of being placed in that category if his friends found out that he initiated a UFO report.

Flying Saucer Sketch

This drawing is from a sketch by Dewey Brake and students at Brentwood Junior High who reportedly saw a noiseless, silver-orange object hovering above the tree tops near Elgin AFB, Ft. 1. The boys said the object remained motionless in the air about an hour.

They said the square lights which hung down from the sides appeared to rotate and changed colors from red to green to blue to white. This object has reportedly been sighted in other parts of the U.S.

passed the intersection of Vincennes
and Elm St. (40-60 feet) I seen the

without a doubt, for I would have seen

descending at angle of - well I will
sketch a picture of my wind shield and
I think that will give you a good
comparison of the object and its
line of descent. It appeared to come
from the W.N.W. (map) very bright and
descending, after perhaps 2 seconds a
piece broke off and it also was
white. It fell fast and left no tail
or trail at all. It fell a short
while, turned yellow like a spark
and went out. It never
went behind any object I had a good
view of the sky at that point. And
I am certain it went out. The large
object then went behind a house.
It appeared dimmer and it did appear

Dear Sirs:

It is my understanding that most reports you receive about UFOs contain religious connotations. I ask that you overlook the fact that this does too and know that I will be cooperative with you fully in order to verify the scientific parts described. Please note my name is omitted in the report because I want absolutely no publicity, and I cannot grant permission for all or any part of this to be published.

I personally want nothing more to do with UFOs and regret my inconclusive curiosity about what they are, but for the sake of others, am willing to undergo your scrutiny and experimentation. It would be a great relief to me if you were to study the few described herein, but I am not financially able to travel far nor to be away from home for long. If you feel you wish to investigate me further, please let me know ahead whom to expect and when.

I am sorry I have only one set of the Polaroid pictures and don't know how you will be able to reproduce them, however I will include the originals in my report to Dr. E.U. Condon since he is the designated Chairman of UFO research. It would be futile to send the tapes without me to explain the significance of the sounds in them, so I will keep them until an official investigator may be able to examine them with me.

There are a few other facts which I did not feel were relevant to the account as I wrote it but which might be important to you, and I will be happy to send them at your request. Thank you all for your kindness in this matter. I will await further word from one of you.

Sincerely yours,
(Mrs.) Morrison McLaughlin

CC: Dr. E. U. Condon
     Major Hector Quintinnalla
     Capt. James E. McDonald

P.S. I have the Polaroid recording this in order to get different copies of the pictures enclosed. The first copies were useless.

AN ENCOUNTER WITH GOD AND THE UFOs

If you have worried that "God is Dead", then Rejoice! For He lives and signs and has power over evil as He promised: And this is my humble testimony to His Truth.

I had expected to write an exposé of the UFOs which are surrounding the earth, and I kept careful notes of the phenomena which I saw and experienced. Now, I am unable to write the precise, systematic report which I envisioned because God, Himself, entered into my experiences. This therefore must become a proclamation of His everlasting Love such as I never dreamed could be revealed in the year 1967.

I have started to write about an adventure which began in February 1967 and essentially ended the first week in September but the end is not yet as you will see. In retrospect, the beginning was long ago when as a child in the Church Kindergarten, I could not understand how the teacher could tell me that "God is Love" and then shake mischievous little boys with a fury that demonstrated only hate; or perhaps, it was when I was eight or nine and heard the Minister preach the Love of Christ, then damn all Roman Catholics; or maybe it was as a teenager at a Church Camp and helped save a drowning baby when the Christian Director became so furious that we who were applying artificial resuscitation were in our underwear that her face was screwed into unbelievable ugliness; or possibly it began during 21 years of marriage to a man who neither knew God nor cared about Him, and I trying to be the "obedient, dutiful wife"

as prescribed by Paul was driven nearly to the brink of in-
sanity. I shall never forget a Psychiatrist's incredulous
query about how how I avoided a complete breakdown when
he had the story of those painful years. I assured him that
always when puzzled, hurt or beaten-down by life, I had search-
ed the Scriptures and therein I found the Spirit of Truth
which saved me from total desolation and despair. And child-
like I believed that " God is in His heaven and all is well
with the world." In late years, I have had to exclude the
latter part of this saying, but I clung to the first part with
a passion; and when in all my summers at Scout Camps, Church
Camps and then as a leader of young scouts, I watched the
stars in His heavens, I wondered if He knew of the desecration
man were making of His world.

Thus it was that on leaving a dear friend's home
about 9 p.m. one early February night and seeing a brilliant
star above it, I expressed amazement for this was unlike any
stars or planets I had ever seen in my many nights out-of-doors.
She assured me that it was not a star, but rather a UFO which
she had reported to the police and the military in the fall of
1955. Her son and husband confirmed that they too had seen sev-
eral of these star-like objects hovering around their home and
said that they bore not only the brilliant white light, but also
tiny red and green ones at their tops. The family stated that
after darting about their pasture, the objects would suddenly de-
part towards the city about 12 miles away at great speeds. They
added that no one seemed able to tell them what these unknowns
really were. I was filled with wonder and curiosity about such

AN ENCOUNTER                Page 3.

happenings. The very next day on my way to work I stopped to buy all the paper-backs available concerning UFOs. Beginning to read them in the chronological order of their publication dates, I devoured a dozen or more including the Air-force Bluebook Project report, all of Frank Edwards' books, the accounts by the Lorenzens, the Adamski story, "The Incident at Exeter", "The White Sands Incident", Sullivan's "We Are Not Alone" and several others. And all the while I searched the skies for some evidence of truth to them for it seemed to me that if UFOs had approached other simple earth-inhabitants I ought to be able to see them too. I did!

By continually watching the heavens day and night, my first sighting occurred at 12:40 p.m. one brilliantly clear day in early March when I saw a jet plane moving very fast from the horizon in the southern sky towards the zenith, and I glimpsed a huge dull-metalic disc-shaped object undulating at great speed ahead of the plane. By comparison the plane seemed to be standing still as it rose in the heavens. I was truly excited and watched more carefully every night which was not foggy or rainy. Whereas I had stood in my yard for fifteen or twenty minutes after the 11 p.m. newscast, I now spent as long as two or/hours (depending on the coldness of the night) looking at the stars of the southern sky. The northern stars were hidden by my house and trees which are so densely crowded in my front yard that they block the view. Shortly after this I returned from late marketing about 9 p.m. and found my daughter's boy friend chatting with her at the back door step. Out of


- page 78 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 4.

habit I glanced up and saw a very bright star in the zenith
of the western sky begin to move towards the east, and all of
us watched it make an abrupt turn to the south. The boy was
as amazed as I and kept exclaiming about the terrific speed
of the object. I asked him to watch while I phoned a friend
who was interested in UFOs but had never seen one. Before I
could dial her number however, the young man called out that
it had disappeared. Disappointed we both searched for another
fifteen minutes or so but saw no other moving object. I call-
ed the Weather Bureau and was informed they had no weather
balloons in the area; none of us could understand how a man-
made satellite could move at such speed nor make such turns.

Continuing to scan the skies, I was attracted by
a brilliant star of first magnitude which friends who are ama-
teur astronomers insisted was the planet Jupiter. In their ex-
pensive telescopes none of us could see any of Jupiter's moons,
and all agreed that what was discernible was a brilliant hard-
edged disc. Even so they believed it was the planet Jupiter.
I kept observing it from early evening until the time it dis-
appeared at the horizon in the NNW. Finally my watch was re-
vised one night in early March when the "star" moved towards me,
the still a great distance away, and delayed its disappearance
by about half an hour. I was certain then that this was not
Jupiter and began to watch it every evening a various isolated
places near my home, the unplowed fields of farmers, a close-by
golf course, as well as my own backyard. It was about this
time that I called the Airforce Bluebook Project at Dayton, Ohio

AN ENCOUNTER                Page 5.

to report my sighting of what sounded like a helicopter flying
low over my house, but which somehow didn't look like one. The
young man who chatted with me ( it was after mid-night ) about
the sighting, promised to send me an official Airforce Observa-
tion Form for reporting UFOs.  The form did not arrive until
several weeks later, and in the meantime so many other fascin-
ating events had occurred that I never used it.

Eventually my persistence in believing Jupiter was
not Jupiter paid-off for one night it moved considerably closer
to me and I saw suddenly aware of a small dim-glowing disc which
hovered behind me at tree-top level. For several nights I tried
to find a place to achieve an even closer sighting until finally
in desperation I decided to see if this disc would "lead" me
while I followed in my car. As if responding to my thoughts,
it led me! In a very hilly area some thirty miles east of my
home, it descended to earth. The spot was an isolated lover's
lane, and in my headlights' glare I could see empty bottles and
the debris of careless people. I was reluctant to get out of my
car in this place, so drove on until I found an uninhabited hill
where I could park and study the sky. When I had walked to the
highest point of it, I discovered that not one, but two bright
stars were descending towards me at an angle thusly:

[A hand-drawn diagram showing two stars/lights descending at an angle]

The dim little disc bobbed up and down at the farthest edge of
the hill, and the two "stars" stopped moving about fifty yards
away from me and simply hovered there. In the brightness of their
lights I could not see what shapes they were. The one from about
WNW was bright and white, while the other from ESE was a bright

AN ENCOUNTER                Page 6.

yellow-orange color. I kept asking myself the question : "Who are you and where do you come from?" It certainly did not seem probable that our American Airforce or Scientists would be interested in me, a grandma with graying hair, nor could I believe any other earthly power would bother with a lone woman. So, I concluded that whatever these objects were they must be of extra-terrestrial origin! When I started to move towards my car after waving my cigarette to them, they immediately began a wig-wagging motion and ascended into the sky away from me, rising at an angle in the manner and direction from which they had come.

A few nights later when I arose about 2 a.m. to go to the bathroom, I looked out of my window at the bright yellow-orange star which hung about 45° S in the sky and was startled to see it suddenly cease being a star and was like a huge dull-orange ball that moved with great speed towards the west, then made an abrupt turn-around, headed to the zenith and disappeared in the ENE. I looked back at the place where it had been shining and discovered that a yellowish but much dimmer star was still there. Another night in an isolated area I watched a brilliant white star descend towards me (always the approach was at an angle as though maintaining the proper degree of declination) and illuminating a farm pond which I hadn't realized was about 100 feet below me on this slight hill. Suddenly, I was aware of a red-hot glowing ball that appeared to rest on the ground several yards beyond the pond. It made me rather apprehensive, but neither of the objects moved towards me, and I was not courageous enough to approach the ball so I waved goodbye and went home. Shortly after this, I saw a very bright star


- page 81 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 7.

at the zenith of the sky above my back door when suddenly a small dull-gray disc fluttered down from it, disappearing in the dim day-light; it was early April and just after sunset, about 7 p.m. I immediately called my friend with the telescope to ask her to watch with me, but she was busy with family until nearly an hour later and by then the sky had become cloudy. I was conscious that something had followed me to her home, and as we drove around for a while, even though I was able to discern movement in the sky, she never saw a thing. The cloud cover became thicker, and I decided it must have been my imagination, although I honestly didn't feel it was. So I kept observing and many nights made trips 30 and 40 miles from home, sometimes following the bobbing disc, and sometimes going to isolated places of my own choosing. Often I would be approached by one or both of the bright objects described before, but sometimes they would roll around the sky like huge balls with their lights out only to reappear at another spot and shine there like a bright star. Several nights I saw nothing at all.

On April 6th an event occurred which I don't understand and cannot explain, but whatever it was, however it was done, it changed my vision! I will endeavor first to tell what happened, and then what effect it had on my eyes. In my neighbor's yard about 90 ft. from where I was observing is a small yellow-orange lantern, while at the end of his drive further away is a mercury-type street light. I had never really noticed those lights since my eyes were always on the sky, but this night when I relaxed to light a cigarette, the lantern suddenly began to glow with such intensity and fiery brilliance that I thought the surrounding shrubs would surely

catch afire. Then I was aware of a beam of light streaming
from the mercury lamp, and moving to where I could see it better
I realized that it was as fiery green as the little lantern was
red. Excepting the Sun, I had never seen such bright and almost
blinding lights. Three dogs who had been romping in the yard
were evidently affected for they came quivering around me but
uttered no sound. I was stunned and apprehensive and wondered
if the unknown objects had landed in or near these lights. I
did not go out the next night, and early on April 8th I left
for Atlanta,rather glad for a respite from the watching and odd
happenings with the UFOs. But I was wrong!

There was no respite,for on arriving at dusk, I was
conscious of extremely brilliant street lights, and of signs at
the side of unfamiliar roads which would have been obscure to my
poor near-sights eyes before but which now were illuminated in
a strange way. Anxiously I scanned the sky in the NE of the city
when I got to my daughter's home and over the tree-tops in her
front yard, a tiny bright-red light went bobbing along, disappear-
ing over the roofs of nearby apartments. I had seen this thing
once or twice before skimming the trees around my yard and I was
convinced that whatever the unknowns were, they certainly knew
where I was. The third night of my stay I went to the drugstore
to get some needed item and on my return, saw the dim disc hover-
ing ahead in the tree tops. I decided to follow it, and in an
area away from bright city lights watched the two bright stars
descending towards me as they had before in my home state but they
did not come nearly so close. I was utterly amazed! When I got
into my car, I realized I was lost, but by asking at gas stations
found my way to my daughter's home,all the while sort of irritated

that Atlantans seem to drive with their headlights on high beam.
Since I sensed that my accounts of UFOs made my son-in-law uneasy,
I did not try to go out again the week I was there. In addition,
my three children who had accompanied me there were terribly bored
and giggled that "Mother's lost her marbles."

It was on the trip home that I began to really become
aware of what had happened to my eyes because the headlights of
all approaching cars seemed to be on their highest beams and were
nearly blinding. When the cars got almost to me however the bril-
liance seemed to die down and the lights appeared very normal, and
I was certain that it was not like drivers flicking their lights
to a lower beam. Little by little I discovered extraordinary
things about my eyesight and that it concerned only my far vision.
Since I don't use glasses for reading, sewing, typing or close
work, there is no difference when I am in a lighted room, but all
lights at a distance ( with or without my glasses ) have strange
shapes. I will try to show below how lights now appeared:

With Glasses                                Nighttime                                Without Glasses

[Diagrams and handwritten notes accompany the text, showing different visual perceptions of lights with and without glasses]

The text includes detailed descriptions of the author's visual experiences with lights, including how car headlights and stars appeared differently to them with and without glasses.

I have noticed too that the smaller stars (approximately 3rd magnitude and less) appear as distinct round discs and that in looking up into a very clear sky, I can see multitudes of these tiny discs far, far distant from what I ever remember seeing before. I had scheduled an appointment in March with an Ophthalmologist for April 23rd, because I thought my glasses were too weak not having had them checked for eight years.

His tests showed that my vision had changed imperceptibly and that no new lens were needed. And he did not discover this ray which puzzled me but I did not mention it either, because I really didn't know very much about it at that time, and foolishly thought I would eventually discover what it is and how it operates. Now, I would be delighted for any doctor or scientist to examine and experiment with it.

Never having studied Physics, I could only guess that the ray which floats before my eyes in daylight must be similar to a laser when it strikes light at a distance. Also, it has increased my peripheral vision so that I can see light which is almost behind me, and I see reflections of light where you would not expect any reflection at all. In trying to take pictures to demonstrate what I mean, I discovered the camera lens picks up this ray when I focus directly at an object, but when I am focusing down, the camera lens picks up what looks like two round balls and both of these phenomena show on the negative and print of the picture taken. At first this unusual sensitivity to light was slightly annoying, but now that I am used to it hasn't bothered me. One thing I wondered about was that before I always got severe headaches and eye strain

Pictures Showing Ray of Light

When I took those first two pictures, I thought the roll of film was defective, but since the ray kept appearing as on the next page, I realized that the camera lens was picking up the peculiar things in my eyes.

The ray seems to go from left to right and vice versa (see pictures #4 and #6) depending upon my relationship to the sun or greatest source of light.

This picture was taken about two hours later by a scientist friend I had called to come experiment with my camera. I had removed myself from the vicinity because of what had happened when he took the picture #9 in this series.

The document appears to contain three black and white photographic images, each with a different arrangement of shapes and lines. The images seem to be part of a technical or investigative document, possibly related to a UFO report. No other legible text is present on the page.

I took those pictures essentially to try to show how shadows and reflections of light now appear to me, e.g. the mirror image outside this window or other windows in my breakfast room which at right angles to it, and the way horizontal lines of screens (and my TV too) appear to be wavy instead of straight.

Also when I turn off my TV the light fades away in a straight line rather then in a diminishing circle as it previously did.

These pictures were not too successful for what I wanted to show, but again the camera lens has picked up the ray, and without the brilliant light of the sun, it seems to have a light of its own at its tip. I did not try to take other pictures than these three pages shown, because I felt I did not have sophisticated enough equipment for a really scientific demonstration.

The only text visible in this document are the numbers:

#7
#8
#9

The images appear to be three nearly identical black and white photographs of a car parked in a wooded area with trees in the background. Each image is slightly different in shading and contrast, but they depict the same scene.


- page 91 -

Here is the text from the document:

When I took this first picture, I was puzzled about the fact that no ray was apparent. So, I moved away from the car and took the next picture which again shows no ray, but does show a curious round ball at the side of the small tree on the right. Reexamining the first picture, I find evidence of this same ball in the trees just above the car. (Now, 2 months later it is not as pronounced as it was and I feel it is due to the poor quality of the Polaroid film, and print).

This is the first picture taken by my friend on the same roll of film as I had used in the pictures above. The sun was on his left, and I was to the right and rear of him. Since there was only a dark brick house and nothing to reflect light from his right, we both feel the light came up as shafts of light by the camera lens.

The images are labeled with numbers #7, #8, and #9, but the text of the images is not legible.

when driving at night, but curiously with lights appearing more brilliant than ever I have no headaches or strain. As I write this, the ray does bother me but for a reason I will explain later.

I suppose many will wonder why a woman fifty years old would deliberately expose herself to the dangers of driving alone far from her home to rendezvous with strange and unknown objects from the sky. For one thing, I know it was done in the spirit of adventure - a seeking in this day for a way of life that confronted my grandmother in the 1880's who had a baby every two years in six different states as she traveled west in a covered wagon. When one has a perspective of history and considers the tremendous courage of the first immigrants to America who crossed that ocean in fragile and vulnerable boats, one feels a sense of incompleteness in these times of ease and comfort and satiation. Also, ages ago I had to struggle to overcome and gripping inner fear, or else succumb to it altogether, and the courage that replaced that fear was indeed a child-like faith in the promises of Jesus Christ. Therefore, my family and friends have often considered my ways unorthodox because, with courage, I have refused to be squeezed into the vice-like mold that makes more timid souls conform. Frankly I feel that many pursue their narrow, dull and unrewarding lives in order to receive kudos and approbation from their fellow men. In trying to live a more full life then, I couldn't care less what men think of me although in the light of God's love I have tried to serve them. Thus, at only one time did I feel real fear of any consequence in these seven months; rather it could be called awe,

curiosity, puzzlement, but not fear per se.

Another reason was that my teenage children had to retire to their rooms almost immediately after dinner for serious study and mountainous homework. Evenings were long with continuous reading and TV pap, and after being cooped in an office all day long, I enjoyed the excuse to be in the out-of-doors, as well as the in-depth study of Astronomy which I had decided I needed for this adventure. (I also needed the mastery of Astro-Physics, Biochemistry, but doubt that I now will ever accomplish this). Lastly, at my age I have often wondered if the lives of my children were to be the only legacy and lone contribution I would leave the world. In my search for Truth in the years gone by I had studied Catholicism, Judaism, Buddhism, Mohammedism, Fundamentalists, the Stoics to try to understand first, why there were so many barriers between men who called themselves "Christian" and then, to learn of the many ways men had come to an understanding of God, or why some men omitted a God altogether in their philosophies of life. And somewhere in these studies I remembered this statement: "The World ought to have been a better place for one's having lived here," and I quoted it as a part of my own creed. Since I cannot paint a great picture nor compose I thought my contribution would come from the scientific discoveries I was making and, at last, I would have something to give for the benefit of all mankind. Little did I know then the outcome! For a while I could forget too the reality, the business for which I had had great expectations was slowly disintegrating from the mismanagement of associates. Therefore I kept on trying to "meet" these unknowns and each encounter would reveal a little more knowledge than I'd had before.

The following are the important things I have learned in almost seven months of consistent observation:

that first, there is not just one, or two UFOs. I have counted as many as seven hanging around the heavens as though they were stars of the first magnitude. In addition I have seen as many as six smaller dimmer objects which hover low in the skies. There may be more of both but this is the maximum count that I actually saw in one night. All move at tremendous speeds but always with a certain amount of undulation. They can turn off lights and seem to disappear completely, but I have seen them hover against a large tree when jets come screaming to find them. Occasionally, they will just move above the plane's path of flight, and sometimes they will follow the plane for a while as if playing tag.

that secondly, they themselves can imitate a helicopter or small plane with the usual red and green lights and with sound. I have seen a large disc move silently towards me with only a faint red glow outlining its shape, and then when just overhead become a "jet" with running lights, exhaust fumes streaming from its rear and with the roar and screaming whine of an actual jet; however, it does not seem to be able to disguise its undulation. Also I have observed a cylindrically shaped "plane" which looks like a one-motor plane of earlier times and sounds like one too, but which is simply too big to be powered by one motor and which can appear day or night out of nowhere. It has been close enough for me to see that it has no markings of any sort except for a dark stripe at its wingtips. On bright days it has a

shiny silver gleam, but on cloudy days looks very dull. 
that third, they seem to be able to manipulate Light and 
Electricity as they please. I have found my headlights on 
when I know that in dark, remote places I have turned them 
off. I have found radios blaring that were off when I went 
to market. My doorbell has rung at 2 a.m. with no one 
there. Farm lights and street lights have been made to shine 
in great rays reaching towards the zenith, and not only in 
rays of light but in black rays too. Three times these un-
knowns have used light to make pictures for me. Once on a 
cloudy night there appeared a huge lighted area in front 
of a tall trees across the meadow. It was like an enormous 
TV screen and in front of it was the figure of what looked 
like an astronaut walking in space. The effect was of light 
on light but with three dimensions, and the figure definitely 
floated in front of the screen. That same night a smaller 
area was used as a "screen" while two small pear-shaped fig-
ures appeared to be bobbing up and down in front of it. The 
third was similar to this last picture and I will describe it 
later since it was in relation to an important happening.

that they can do anything they please with Sound and Energy. 
If I knew anything about Physics, I suppose this would really 
not be separated from Light and Electricity, but I do so be-
cause of distinct things that happened. For weeks, I was sure 
that a cricket near me in the grass did not have the same 
rhythm as other crickets around the yard, and gradually I re-
alized it was a sort of dot-dash code. Eons ago I had learn-
ed the Morse Code when a young scout but never to receive or

send it with skill, so I bought a dog whistle too shrill
to disturb human ears and tried to learn the M.C. Meantime,
I was hearing this dot-dash business from other insects, and
a closely woodpecker would change from his ordinary rat-a-tat
to very definite dot-dashes. I bought a tape recorder which
I could ill afford and tried to start taping these sounds so
that when I learned the Morse Code I could interpret them.
Unfortunately, I was able to get only a few tapes before the
unknowns discovered my recorder and somehow blocked all sound
from my magnetic tape. Two or three times I tried to record
on the same blank tape and got perfect reproductions from
radio and stereo, so I know the tapes were not faulty. For
a long time I thought they had special devices which imitated
sound (and I still think this) but I also discovered that they
can manipulate energy which is already there. I have heard
the dot-dashes in all of my appliances, dishwasher, refrigerator, drier, as well as the heating tea-kettle, running water,
sink drain, typewriter keys and in my own pulse and heart beat.
How it is done I simply do not know! At any rate I got pretty
good at sending the Morse Code and found I did better with a
pair of Spanish Castanets, than the dog-whistle. I will relate
some of the message sent and received later, but I must report
that my hearing became very acute just when I thought I needed
a hearing aid and my children were fussing about my deafness.

that with sound they could imitate motorcycles or sport cars,
and played an extensive game with the local police who were
busy chasing "speeders" around the village in July. I am sure
the police got some innocent people in their pursuit of these
sounds. At first I thought it amusing, but I knew it was also


- page 98 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 16.

disturbing to my neighbors and I tried to signal them with my cigarette to hush. (In writing this, I must mention that a squib in the village news which is published every few months states that residents are glad to have peace and quiet again after the noises at the beginning of the summer)! In addition, I have heard the tires of little old ladies' cars squeal so loudly when they turned a corner you would have thought they were hot-rodders! They can manipulate radio, TV waves, as well as police short-waves, so that sounds of programs have come from startling places; my neighbor's swimming pool (he thought it was prowlers), dense woods, isolated fields, etc. In addition they can speak in perfect English but with a metallic ring to it. I will tell about this shortly.

that wherever I have been the animals, birds, insects, fish tree-toads, bullfrogs and all creatures seem to be affected by the nearness of the unknowns. Cows and chickens will moo and crow at midnight, and fish seem to leap out of farm ponds and streams gasping for breath. Since I did not become aware of them until I had either seen or heard them, I wondered what this instinct was that let animals know of their presence.

I tried to avoid going near any farms where there were cattle or dogs and most often watched from a huge gravel pit or from land that was for sale and uninhabited. They had some way of "fogging in" the meadow or area where I was and the small of the "fog" was acrid, and probably would have been unbreathable if I were not already a chain smoker with charred lungs.

As nearly as I can describe it, the odor was like that of an aluminum pan left empty on a hot electric burner, but that is not exact. My own dogs are silent if I am out in the yard,


- page 99 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                Page 17.

but when the unknowns,or rather their devices,come in the
late night hours my dogs do not bark or yipe, but utter a
sort of half-cry in a high pitch.

that lastly whenever I have taken someone with me to observe,
nothing distinguishable happens excepting for three days
when I was with a beloved friend on the Atlantic coast this
summer. She watched a bright star move from over the land
to hover outside our motel window which looked onto the sea.
Also she experienced the "fogging" one night when we were
out on the beach, as well as the dot-dash tapping from the
roof above our room. Because the skies were cloudy we did
not see the skies, but she watched the street light near the
beach suddenly send rays (light and black ones) skyward as
if it were a powerful searchlight. She also observed another
phenomena with me and that is when I am out in daylight walking or driving, no matter how still the air, some little bunch
of leaves from a bush or tree will start a "fluttery" motion
quite unlike the way wind moves leaves. I hesitate to guess,
but I do feel it is some sort of controlled energy, and that
if I had not been so acutely tuned-in to sight and sound I
would never have noticed it. With the exception of seeing
some very oddly-lit fireflys in early summer (my sister saw
them too and was alarmed) I have never seen any device that
could have been used as a conductor.

I have tried diligently to list all manner of things
observed since the beginning of this experience that seem
significant. The last week in July when I went East, they
followed and I stopped my car about 9 p.m. along the Pa. Turn-


- page 100 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 18.

piko to watch one that I had seen following me in my rear vision
mirror; they were making dot-dash sounds at my motel in N.Y. and
were at Harvard and MIT where I stopped on route East. I tried to find
a scientist, any scientist, at those two centers of learning to
tell these things to. Unfortunately, Dr. Phillip Morrison with
whom I really wanted to talk was out of the country, and the very
kind Biochemist I did see at MIT told me that his kind of science
would need my eyeball for study. I simply didn't feel prepared
to leave even one eyeball with him at that moment. While we
chatted I watched the "quivery" leaves of a tree outside his win-
dow and wondered if my conversation was being monitored. Having
told of the experiences along the ocean, I was aware that they
had followed me to the Washington, D.C. area where I went after
leaving the coast, when I saw the tiny red light bopping over
tree tops outside my motel window. I was conscious of them at
Arlington and again at a ceremony at Ft. McNair but I neglected
to record the exact reasons why. I would like to check my travels
around the country vis-a-vis Airforce Radar records because of the
inevitable presence of Jets wherever I went. For a while their
planes came screaming over my house with such regularity that I
thought the place could have been pin-pointed from their radar
scope. I simply do not know what was picked up on radar screens,
for excepting the two daylight sightings related herein, I never
saw any objects. At night however I often watched unknown maneu-
ver lower than the lowest screen on radar towers and sometimes go
undetected. But usually Jets would come screaming overhead passing
the exact place I happened to be observing. Unhappily the objects
were always able to avoid their flight path. I say this now, but

originally, was
had nothing that equalled the obvious power of these unknowns,
and that if the Airforce was over to discover they were it was
not going to be by wild scrambles, but rather by quiet study.
Perhaps, the United States and other national governments know
already what I have found out, but if they do, it is certainly
not being published.

On my return home I was busy with family and did not
go out much the first two weeks of August, but I did read a
couple of new publications about UFOs, one of which described
their occupants and the other which stated that they were enemies
from outer space.  I tried to analyze the first book's accounts
of meetings which people on earth had had and decided that only
a small percentage out of the total number described were very
alarming, and besides I had found that some things the unknowns
did were hilariously funny and concluded that they must indeed
be more like the loving creatures described by Adamski and Dr. Fry
than enemies.  And I decided I too would have to have an actual
face-to-face confrontation!  So it was near mid-August when the
first near meeting came.  I had gone to a remote fishing pond and
walked from my car to a huge unused pasture beyond.  It was about
10:30 p.m. when I know Arcturus would be low in the sky and the
UFO which hung in front of it could come towards me, but instead,
my peripheral vision caught sight of the tiny redlight settling
down amid trees on the far side of the pond not too distant from
where I was parked.  I was immediately "fogged in" and could hardly
distinguish the pond while the night insects started a cacophonous
din like I'd never before heard.  This was one time my fear went
deeper than apprehension and I didn't want to panic, so I walked


- page 102 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 20.

slowly back towards my car. I had passed the edge of the pond and was going up a slight hill alongside the woodsy area when I heard definite thump- thumps. It was not like footsteps and I knew I simply was not prepared for a night encounter in a lonely, foggy place and I went quickly to my car. Once inside and out on the road again, I was disgusted with myself for the near panic, so I drove to a field where I had witnessed many of the things described already. I kept thinking that if I could only see beforehand what I was to meet, even if hideously ugly, I wouldn't be overcome by fear. When I reached the field and started to walk across it, there suddenly appeared another "light screen" only this time the light from a farm home was man-ipulated and it was orangish-yellow rather white as the others had been. Again in front of the spread of light were the two pear-shaped figures which were bending and bowing as they bobbed up and down. I was too far away to see detail, and I simply don't know what they could have been.

I was astonished that the unknowns had shown me a picture as if in reply to my thoughts, but/other times I felt that they had read my mind. Looking back, I know I gave them an omniscience which I do not now believe they possess. If they read things off the top of my/mind, they simply could not read my heart; but this I did not understand at the time. I was making a concentrated effort to receive the Morse Code since their dot-dashes became ever more frequent but I was too dumb to follow at the speed they were sent. I had tapped out the questions I wanted to know: "Who are you and where do you come from?" several times and once had told them my name is: "-----". I could understand only a few words that they sent me such as: "Come out",


- page 103 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 21.

"U Pla With Me" and when I was driving, directions such as "Left", "Right" and "Stop". Once I had ask them: "Do You Know" and that night after I had gone to bed my watch started a ver- its dot-dash rhythm which I was able with careful concentration read as the same question I had sent: ? Do U No God?". Most of the time I spelled words as they are written in English, only rarely a phonetic spelling. But on the other hand, the majority of the words were with phonetics and only occasionally did they come as to spell it.

On August 30th I took my children to a dinner they were invited to attend, and I drove out to my favorite field even though the weather was gray and overcast. It was still light being on 6:30 p.m. so I could see nothing of stars or objects in the sky. The field has a quite high elevation and as I looked at the surrounding countryside, I saw what I thought was a white cloud in the distant sky. But the "cloud" which was above another field a quarter of a mile away moved to the front of trees which bordered that field, and I could see a perfectly round ball of a translucent whitish color, but with no lights of any sort. It made several starts towards me, then after about fifteen minutes the sky darkened with rain clouds and lightning was appearing, so I went back home. During these last days of August the "plane" I described previously kept making more frequent appearances, and I began to wonder if a daylight meeting might not be best. After the children had left for school, ember 1st, I started out toward the wilderness area and immediately got messages to go right or left, forward, etc. I must explain that any little rattle in my car became the source of some sounds that most often it was the jack in the right rear of my station wagon which had not been replaced properly and made quite a racket.

I arrived in an isolated area where I had never been before and was slowly driving up a steep hill, following an unpaved gravel road and certain that at the top I would find a field where the "plane" could land. But as I arrived at the peak, I saw a field on my left loaded with cars and I was stunned: They were carefully parked and it was not a junk yard so my first thought was "My God, these are cars of others who have been lured away." As I crept on, I heard a cry in perfect English, "C'mon, ----" and looking across that field of cars I suddenly glimpsed a large group of people who were shooting guns on the first legal day for Dove Hunting. Naturally I was relieved, but rather irked I had spent two hours arriving no-where, and I sped home to get chores done.

That was Friday, and all day and night I kept hearing the tapping which spelled "Kom Out". It continued Saturday and Sunday, but I was busy and did not go till Monday. I awoke very early Labor Day and decided to try in the dawn before the days' activities began. Again following directions I came to the area of the Dove Hunt, but this time was told to "stop" in a partially hidden lane near a creek. It too had the litter of fishermen and picnickers, and wilderness was encroaching on all sides of the stream. Choosing to walk down center of its shallow bed rather than wade through poison ivy, I kept hearing a signal from somewhere in the trees to "go on". I walked further into the wilds, listening and looking at the sky but saw nothing. Finally after I had rounded several curves and my boots were soaking, I stopped to examine some fascinating fossil/ formation in the rocks along the edge of the stream. I wasn't paying much

AN ENCOUNTER                Page 23.

attention but I suddenly heard insistent tapping and on listening carefully realized they had spelled the word "Jok_". There was no g but I knew what was meant and was really irritated I had been on another goose chase. I flew home arriving about 10 a.m. with three and a half hours wasted. Later in the day, I was tired and laid down to read Life but fell asleep. On awakening a short time later I heard a very carefully tapped: "Feet Wet ?" Of course the question mark wasn't there, but I'm sure it should have been, and I almost rolled off my bed in hysterical glee. I guess I had never considered before how much energy is released when a body is just lying quietly on a bed, and I should explain that even the relaxation of my muscles was used as the source of the dot-dash sounds. Sometimes it would come from my finger tips as they lay rested on the sheet and their tapping was certainly involuntary on my part. Most of the time the sound came from my own pulse beat near my ear as my head rested on my shoulder (I sleep mostly on my stomach with my head on one arm or the other), but once in a while the sound came from the middle of my bed and I couldn't figure out whether some part of me was causing it, or whether it came from a totally extraneous source. It was truly fascinating to me to contemplate the tremendous amount of unused energy there is and now marvelous it would be if we knew how to harness it as the unknowns did.

I must digress here to add something of importance to this whole business. And that is that Sundays did not seem to have any special meaning to the unknowns for they used to really augment the train rumbles during services (the tracks pass close to the Church) and make candles wave wildly on the Altar while the organ would give an extra twist now and then which I know

startled the poor embarrassed organist. Therefore, I had to come
to some conclusion regarding such irreverence for day which I con-
sidered Holy, and was really the one day of the week where I could
go get renewal and refreshment from a Power larger than myself
in order to continue the routine of daily living (and at this
time, it was dreary daily living). From all the evidence of their
superior knowledge and from their delicious sense of humor, I had
just about decided that they were from a super civilization which
had progressed far beyond ours on earth because they'd had no Sin
to bog them down as we did; that very likely they were unacquainted
with our custom of worship on Sundays because in such a heavenly
atmosphere they just worshipped God around the clock (or maybe even
worked with Him) and had no need for special days since He had not
had to enter into and direct their lives as He had with man. I also
considered the possibility that Man's Fall and the concept of Origin-
al Sin might be a bunch of mystical hogwash which had prevented Man
from discovering all these fabulous powers and from making full use
of his talents. I wondered if there was a God after all, but with
my background of seeking, I had to return to the first thought that
these unknowns came from Him or at least, with His permission to
cavort around earth's heavens.

Labor Day night I got the urgent message to come out, but
but being annoyed about the trip to the wilderness that morning I
clacked out a reply that I simply could not come out for jokes, and
that I did not have the time or money to just play and that I had
to go to work to feed my children. (The business I had worried about
in the Spring had collapsed in mid-summer and I planned to find
a job the first week or so in September after the children had re-
turned to school). Well, the question came: "Wil U Pla Wil Me ?"

So I answered that I truly had not been playing but that I wanted to know who they were and where they came from. And I want to bed. The next night I firmly decided that I was going to brave a meeting and have the whole business done with no matter what. When I got to the fishing pond, a car was there with young people in it, so I drove to an isolated place near some railroad tracks. I parked and was walking down the tracks to get away from the road when I heard a pounding on the rails.

This time the dot-dashes read: " U B O K - U Un of Us - U B Alrite ----- " U and I R Un." I was no little disturbed!

As I have written, I had turned to God for help all of my life, and in Him was my strength and with Him was I one as Christ promised. Therefore either the unknowns were "one" with Him too, or I was about to "B Un" with something, someone I had never met. I didn't really want to contemplate what they might be if they were not from God. I decided not to try to meet that night and went back home to search the Scriptures to see what was written there about "other worlds"; to see if there was any clue to the relationship of the unknowns with God, and/or this world. Unhappily I did not find any satisfactory answer, although Christ's statement: "other Sheep have I but not of this pasture" made me wonder if He spoke of more than the Gentiles.

I also noted that He referred at another place to the "devil and his angels" And I reread the story of Christ's temptation which I really never had understood. Also, there came to my mind a dispute I had had with my Minister when in a study class that concerned the Apostle Paul and whether or not he liked women. I had found a reference in Timothy that Paul would not let women speak in Church nor hold office and the explanatory notes had


- page 109 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 26.

stated that Paul thought women were the weaker sex and simply too
easily tempted and misled. Of course, I never thought Adam showed
such admirable character when he succumbed to Eve's persuasion,
but I began to wonder if the exciting displays of power and my
interest in the unknowns were becoming an idol for me. I had
really tried to act in a very friendly way towards them and faceti-
ously referred to them as "my friends".  The whole bit was just
too much to figure out, and I decided I would just have to have
faith that since God had protected me thus far, He would continue
to do so.  But I was totally not prepared for what lay ahead.

So it was that I answered their tapping to come out two
nights later.  This time I went to my familiar field and parked,
but this time, I got a distinct tapping to go left.  I was puzzled
because I had always gone to the field on my right (its 152 acres
of field, woods and stream are for Sale and uninhabited).  I decid-
ed to follow directions, climbed the barbed wire fence and went
up a steep incline into the field.  On my left was fairly clear
and rolling pasture land, while to my right was a woodsy area
whose terrain I could only guess at.  I had brought my small copy
of the New Testament which also contained the Psalms and Proverbs
that I always carried after that "close" meeting in August, and for
some untold reason I had brought a flashlight, something I never
carried since I had had one in the earliest of ventures and it
seemed to alarm the unknowns.

As I walked slowly away from the road and fence, I heard
the loudest din and banging I've ever heard and it seemed to come
from a ramshackle farmhouse which I knew was about 1/2 mile up the
road.  It was as if someone were pounding steel against steel with
powerful strokes and it was soon apparent that these were in a dot-


- page 110 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                Page 27.

dash rhythm which spelled "Go On - Go On - Go On". While I was getting used to this racket, a man's voice started yelling: "Go on Mommie, you'll be awright! Go on! You awright, go on, Mommie!"

It was like a cheer leader urging a team to victory and it was the terrible urgency which stunned me! While I didn't wonder much about the mechanical sound of the voice, I did feel odd that the word Mommie was used instead of my name. I tried to look down the road to see if I could see anything at the old farmhouse when a light I am sure was the mercury type, flared up so brilliantly that I could see its glow from where I was. It was then that dogs on that farm and others farther away began the worst, loudest and most pitiful wailing ever. The banging would stop for a few seconds and so would the yelling and the dogs; then, it would start all over.

I was chilled in my tracks, but finally I wrote with my cigarette in the air: "I am not afraid because God is with me, but what of those poor dogs?" Then I took my New Testament a few pages further and leaned it against a light pole which stood in the field.

Next I took the flashlight and beamed it around the sky where I knew the unknowns were hanging and then let it shine on that little book.

After that I came straight home.

The next day was rainy and dreary all day long and I wondered all day long if they had picked up the Bible and carried it away, or if it was merely lying there rain-sogged. Finally, at 4 p.m. I had to go see! So I drove in pouring rain, sloshed to the spot and found the Bible near where I'd left it but creased open to Proverbs 3. I brought it home and read and reread and pondered, for the 19th verse says: The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding He hath established the heavens.

Surely it would seem the unknowns were His and I need have no fear of them.

I did not go out again that night but after I had retired the house started bumping and shaking as if my girls upstairs were doing a wild Watusi. As the disturbance continued I ran to the foot of the stairs and called up to them to stop. They had been making no noise! The younger was already in bed and the elder was fixing her hair in the bathroom and neither had been dancing.

I could only guess that we had had some manner of visitor. At any rate I went back to bed and was nearly asleep when the tapping started on my mattress. I really didn't feel like concentrating, (I still can't get the Morse Code when it is given with speed), but suddenly I hear, J*E*S and I came fully awake to listen to the rest which went like this: " Jesus is Savor - We R His to me no to men - Kom out an get instruksh - Sa no mor - Savor is in His hevan." Well you can/imagine my distress and anguish! I have never considered myself a very fine or good example of a Christian and in times past had followed the lusts of the flesh and once had been on the verge of alcoholism, as an habitual smoker, have sworn like a stevedore and had no patience with myself or others. Altogether I had hoped to be allowed to have a niche in the farthest corner of Heaven and trusted that Christ was what He said He was - the Son of God and willing to forgive us who seem to be made more of clay than iron. But to send such a message to me? Incredible and completely astounding! I finally went back to bed after pacing my room for half an hour and my trusty little Nytol put the whole business out of my mind.

Saturday, September 8, I was busy getting chores done and had no time to think more about the matter until after the lunch hour. There was to be a funeral at our village church at 2 p.m. and I debated whether or not to go; first because I've seen so


- page 112 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 29.

many dearly loved ones gone and to me their funerals were unbearable in my grief, and secondly, because I felt "modern" funerals are almost barbaric, I had already decided to will my body to a medical school for whatever use the poor tired thing could be to science and to not have a service for grieving of any sort. If anyone missed me, I truly felt he could weep in the privacy of his closet where he might find solace and comfort from the Holy Spirit. Well, all this was going through my head as I emptied a vase full of dead flowers and ran water into it. Curiously, at the time I did this in one sink, a glass already rinsed and full of water sat in the adjoining sink, and the water in it began to move and swirl around. I turned off the faucet and watched while the water whirled more violently than before. I was fascinated and couldn't understand what was causing the movement, while the water in the vase became still.

I looked down into the glass for a "bug" but none was there. And as I stared, there appeared black concentric lines in the manner of an Op Art painting which moved with the rhythm of the water; but suddenly the art pattern disappeared and the water was absolutely still, and in a precise and tiny square at the far side of the glass was a picture of a city! It was as if I were looking at a miniature TV screen and the details were as sharp as those of a photograph. Of course, my first thought was that the unknowns were using this device in order to answer my question: Where do you come from? But as I stared at the picture I was puzzled because the buildings and landscape were like an ancient town on earth and certainly not what I would have expected that beings who zipped around in powerful machines would live in, nor did it fit any preconceived ideas I might have


- page 113 -

had of the many "mansions" of heaven. It occurred to me that
it was more like photos I had seen of old Jerusalem than any-
thing else, and I was perplexed.

But while I was thinking about this, the picture
changed to the head of a men shown in profile, and I was stunned
by the beauty and strength and exquisitely chiseled features
of this man. And the thought almost arose that this must be
what they looked like when I realized that this man wore a
crown of leaves and thorns. I knew in an instant it was the
Head of Christ, but certainly not like any I'd ever seen por-
trayed by man. Having had a lifetime interest in the History
of Art I knew I had never seen a Christos such as this. Now
I was truly confused, for I simply could not understand the
meaning of this. As I stood watching, there appeared another
head of a man, also in profile, but he was bald and rather
cruel looking, and I was bothered because I could not see his
eyes clearly. Also, the portrait was more like a drawn carica-
ture than a photograph but excepting for the eyes, the features
were clear. And following this man there came pictures of two
or three others and I kept thinking if only I could see their
eyes I might recognize them. Then suddenly appeared a profile
I knew well for it was the face of Hitler! And after him came
caricatures of Stalin and Mussolini and following those, two or
three more heads I did not know but one of which bore very
oriental looking features and there was no beauty in any of
them. After the last head came a series of men, and I suppose
women and children, for they were so disfigured with eyes gouged
out and faces twisted and scarred that I shuddered. The very
last picture was the portrait of a pig with a hat on, dressed


- page 114 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 31.

as a man. His eyes were mere slits and I could hardly see
a mouth, but his nose was definitely the snout of a pig, and
as I watched, the mouth spread into a wide, a greedy, satiated
grin. It was not very pretty! I stood there trembling for
there were no more pictures and my mind was churning in con-
fused thoughts.

I looked all around the inside of the glass and simply
did not understand. All I could see now were the reflection of
leaves from the top of a tall tree out in the yard, and I stood
there staring into the glass and trying to arrange my thoughts,
trying to find an answer. Suddenly, a tiny yellow fish appear-
ed on the other side of the glass from where the pictures had
been. I looked for the source of the yellow since the sun was
not shining then, and I realized it came from a paper cup in
the window sill. But by all laws of reflection, I should have
seen more than a tiny fish! And as I watched the little fish,
my perplexity doubled for it slowly became elongated so that
it looked like an eye in the manner of wrap around glasses. I
thought then that it must have some reference to my peculiar
vision, but answers did/come to the meaning of the rest that
I had seen. I tried to reason that the unknowns were present-
ing pictures as the portrayal of an all-loving, all-forgiving
God, and yet to me who wept at Hitler's madness and even more
when his Death Camps were exposed, this thought didn't ring
true. What was Christ doing with all those men of ugliness
and infamy? And why the maimed and tortured beings so similar
to those in Picasso's famous painting "Guernica"? I found no
answers, and I pushed away the thought that these might have
come from God Himself. It was too overwhelming to even consider!

Putting my quandry aside I went to the funeral and tried
to watch with equanimity, but in my state, my passions were high
kindled at the gross manner in which the whole business was done.
When friends who visited me later expressed like feelings, my
indignation was only kindled, and after they left, I wrote a
rather burning letter to the Minister. Then, since it was early
evening decided I would call him instead. Of course, I know now
that more upsetting than his cold funeral was all that I had ex-
perienced in the past twenty-four hours. And part of it I tried
to share with him like that message about "Savor gathering His
sheaf", but finally after 45 minutes of anguish and wanting to
reach this man, I thought I heard him lie to me about something he
had said to me concerning the Apostle Paul three or four weeks
before. I hung up more upset than ever and went to the nearest
meeting place I had with the unknowns. I took my dog-whistle
and my little Bible and I had to find an answer. Here and now!
As I walked from the car towards the center of the huge place,
an unused gravel pit, I began to whistle in Morse Code: "I hope
you don't lie to me like men do." All the while I was searching
the sky, and although it was not really clear, the stars were
quite visible all through the zenith to about 45 degrees around
the celestial heaven. Now, not far from this gravel pit are three
lights; two are large mercury lamps and the third a smaller yellow-
orange one. I know from past experiences that the smallest light
acted as a warning signal to the unknowns around the sky; if cars
or people were near me and the gravel pit, the light would dimin-
antly than the other two lights. When jets or other planes came
near the area it was the signal used to warn all the unknowns of

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 33.

danger. I had often wondered how they managed this and had suspected that some device was used to manipulate the power of that particular lamp. Tonight I was in such a state I couldn't have cared less.

Proceeding toward the interior of the gravel pit, and hoping for an answer to my questions: "Do you come from God? Or do you lie?", I was conscious that tall trees near my usual spot for observing were bending with the pressure of a sudden wind which when the unknowns approach over a woods. For a moment I thought they were surely coming to land. But then, I heard the clear steady beat of an insect at my feet and was startled at its tone and the fact that there were no dots, no cashes. I looked quickly at the sky and saw that all the stars and heavens had been covered with a black, filthy-looking fog, and just in time, I glimpsed the small signal light in the distance fade away and go out completely. And in that second I realized that the Power of God was with me and that my "friendly unknowns" were indeed like the infamous man I had been shown who now had to hide themselves from a Power greater than their own. I walked back to my car sobbing my thanks to my God and my Christ for His protection and for the understanding given me, one of the least of mankind!

I supposed this would be the end of the matter, but it was not. Now I knew the pictures were His work and I should have recognized the tiny Fish and the All-seeing Eye of God as the most precious symbols of Christendom. I should have remembered too that (excepting for the time on the ocean) the unknowns never showed themselves when another human was near me, and that

afternoon a dear friend had been helping wash kitchen and break-
fast room windows. Of course, looking back I should have known
that anyone who would say "We R His" and not be aware of Man's
ages-old custom of worshipping Him one day out of seven must be
a liar. But how easy to look backwards and see all my false reason-
ing; to think that the dogs wailed and the birds and insects lit-
erally shrieked when the unknowns came near because they did not
have the power to think and to reason like I did. I know now I
subscribed all manner of "goodness" to whoever, whatever they were,
because I simply could not envisage any more evil in this Universe
than exists here on earth; I suppose their misuse of cosmic power
is the same as with Nuclear Power which man possesses: what might
have been a force for total good became instead an awful instru-
ment of destruction.

Unhappily because of the ray (which I had been so
sure would somehow benefit man) I was still connected to these
powerful forces, and as I wrote the first rough draft of this
wonderful experience the dot-dashes became more incessant and the
"plane" buzzed my house night and day, while the ray was unbearable.
As with the light at the gravel pit, the power behind the ray
seemed to be turned up full force, and by Tuesday evening my eyes
were burning and my nerves frayed. I could stand no more! So,
at bed time I took the Castanets and clicked this one last message:
"I am sorry. I thought you knew I belong to Jesus. I came to seek
Truth and He came with me, but you hid from us. He has showed me
who you are. I live by His grace and in His power and I cannot
comeout anymore. I have work to do for Him. With love from God
and me. Goodbye." I really wanted to scream out, leave me alone,
but I began remembering all the things I had read about these un-


- page 119 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                Page 35.

knowns in the few instances where they had been harmful to
human beings in chance encounters on earth (things I had chosen
to completely disregard before) and I thought if I sent a sort
of friendly goodbye they would be inclined to go away altogether.

Curiously, I went to bed for the first time to sleep
without harassment and the quiet continued until about sundown
Wednesday. Then, the dot-dashes started, timidly at first, but
gradually becoming more and more bold. By Friday, the birds
were shrieking and that night the dogs were frantic. I was
terrified for when awake I could exercise all the faith I had
that God was with me, but in that twilight zone between complete
consciousness and deep sleep, I was heckled with incessant dot-
dashes and a shrill whistle in my inner ear to which I simply
did not want to listen. In addition in these periods of wake-
fulness and half-sleep, I could smell the acrid "fog" which had
never been in my own yard before! Thus, early Saturday morning
I sought comfort and help from my Minister and while he read
the rough draft of this report, I went into the Church Sanctuary
to pray, and to try to augment this faith that I so freely mouthed.
Now it had happened that with this peculiar vision, all the reflec-
tions of the gem-like pieces of glass in the Stained-Windows were
in such exquisite patterns and so intrigued me that on Sundays I'd
had to force myself to concentrate on the worship service, and this day
I simply wanted no remembrance of that ray at all. So I had kept
my eyes almost shut and as I literally sprawled at the steps to
the Altar, my super-peripheral vision caught the reflection on
the wall to my left and almost behind me of one of the gems. It
struck me that this was not what the reflections had been like be-
fore, and I turned and stared wonderingly at a little yellow fish!


- page 120 -

AN ENCOUNTER                                                Page 36.

I turned then and looked full hard at the wall which reflected the bright sun rays, and it was covered with many, many little yellow fishes! Nowhere did I see the fancy, lacy double-patterns that I had found so fascinating before, and again I felt a terrible surge of thankfulness that God cared and an even greater compulsion to share the whole experience with others.

My terror of the unknowns began to diminish, but I was still in ragged physical and nervous shape, and I am sure the two Ministers from whom I sought comfort and concern that day must have thought I was a basket-case ready for a mental ward. Sadly, they did not seem to understand the urgency of my need, and I slowly realized that the whole matter was one which only God could resolve.

The sun was absolutely brilliant all that day, and by late afternoon I was desperate for my eyes felt like they would burn out of my head. Thus, at 6:30 p.m. when driving towards the West and directly into the Sun whose blinding light neither my dark glasses nor car visor could hide, I cried to God that I would rather be blind than have/this ray any longer. I was fully aware that I might be blinded and have a wreck, and I don't know what happened. Somehow the light became dimmer and the ray less bothersome, but a remnant of it remains. I have prayed that God would remove it altogether but He does not. Maybe it is left for the "doubting Thomas's" to whom this story will seem incredulous, or maybe there is something beneficial that men of science can learn from it. At any rate, I shall have to leave it to the wisdom of God, for He certainly knows by now how much of an anathema it has become to me, and He knows too how these infamous unknowns have used it to annoy and exhaust me.

When I mentioned some things about this experience to my sister, she warned me that if I said I was"hearing things" I might be adjudged insane and that I had better keep still. Well, quite by accident I have a tape recording of the "sounds" I hear in my inner ear. Because they were unceasing at night, I decided that I would put my recorder mike under my pillow since the unknowns didn't seem to like tape-recordings and hoped that it would deter them from heckling me. To my amazement when I replayed the tape the next day, I found it contains my labored breathing as I tried to get to sleep and some of the dot-dash sounds I've tried to describe, but more important, the very sensitive mike picked up the shrill whistle which I hear in my inner ear! It also is in a code, but I did not try to "read" it because I simply want no more to do with the whole matter. I will be glad to give all my tapes to the government and/or whatever science group might desire to study them.

By consciously trying to feel the presence of God ( I have practically memorized the six-record Album of Handel's Messiah and I thank God the man lived and composed such wondrous music 200 years ago), I have been able to ignore the persistence of the unknowns which has continued now for two weeks - the never-ending brilliant lights, the dot-dashes, the dogs' peculiar cries in the nights, the birds' shrieking, and the "plane" which has been overhead more frequently with the inevitable Jets out searching. A week after I learned what the unknowns are really like I told a part of this to some dear friends. In the group was a stranger who informed me that the Bible is the last word of God and that men do not have "visions" anymore. Well, I feel if I had had a "vision", I would have fainted dead away, and I

truly believe it was absolutely cool of God to use a medium of
communication with which I was familiar. But the essence of
the total experience was the overwhelming knowledge that God
cares; and if He cares enough to intervene in the folly of one
single simple soul, here and now, how very much comfort that
ought to bring to those who now believe He is and to the multi-
tude of others who have not yet found Him!

I never understood before now what in the world Martin
Luther meant when he wrote "A Mighty Fortress is Our God" and
included the words about an ancient foe whose craft and power
are great and who on earth had no equal. Though I did not ob-
tain the scientific knowledge I sought, perhaps what I did dis-
cover will be of even greater benefit to mankind. It is with a
certain despair that I write this knowing many will not believe
one word herein, but I feel compelled to warn men that the un-
knowns are indeed powerful and malevolent forces as portrayed
that Saturday afternoon. And I feel compelled to shout with joy
the whole of Handel's Alleluia Chorus: "King of Kings and Lord of
Lords. He shall reign forever and ever! "

EPILOGUE TO AN ENCOUNTER

A month has passed since that astonishing disclosure ended my sorties with UFOs, and it has been a turbulent time of anguish interspersed with joy. Because I felt the scientific facts of the observation were of little importance, I gave this report to all manner of Christians to read, and on the advice of two protestant ministers I went to consult with a man distinguished in his profession of Pastoral Counseling.

Sorrowfully his cold manner, his questions and responses to my statements utterly confused and baffled me. When I proffered my thoughts that Christians with much knowledge and many educational degrees had been unable (excepting in two instances) to accept my account as true, but that those who were uneducated and nearly illiterate had believed it was so and therefore that they seemed to have a certain wisdom, the man immediately asked: " And I suppose you have wisdom?" I was dumbfounded! My mind had been considering the verse in Proverbs, "with the lowly is Wisdom", and I had not been thinking of myself in any way. Since I was the reporter, I simply did not see how I could be expected to have an objective reaction at all; I felt his question was in defense of his own status. Our discourse continued for over an hour, and his judgment was that my problem was that I wanted to be God, that I had been acting out symbolically all the needs in my own life, and that I might do well to see a Psychiatrist. If I had been emotionally torn by the events which had been happening, I was almost totally devastated by this man. But not quite.

Somewhere in all our talk, I had quoted the promise of Christ (John 14:20), "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you." To this he replied that that

saying certainly had an element of "sickness" in it, and I began
to see that men with great knowledge of the human mind might not
always understand the human spirit. And I had the feeling that,
since Freud, men could not openly demonstrate the warm love and
compassion which Christ gave His disciples and particularly, John,
for fear of being proscribed queer and unnatural. It was later
then, when I remarked that Christ had said, "If I called ye Gods..."
that the man at once corrected me by stating that he was a student
of the Bible and that the quote was not from the New Testament.
I hastantly suggested that since it was in my Bible, maybe he
could find it in his. So following a concordance, he found the
verse in the New Testament (John 10: 34), and on hastily reading
it, chortled that I had simply misinterpreted its meaning altogether.
There was no apology, not even the courteous admission that he had
forgotten Christ ever used it. And I wondered what kind of student
of the Bible would not know precisely Christ's most powerful pro-
clamation of Himself as the Son of God (John 10: 24-38)? As I
left the conference, the man said that he had noticed I was full
of bitterness, and since I couldn't tell him I was not bitter, but
rather consumed with grief over the fact that he, a Christian Chap-
lain, had been of no help or comfort, I simply agreed and told him
I would follow his suggestion to see a Psychiatrist.

I went immediately to my scientist friend who had assist-
ed me earlier in the summer with the experimental pictures of the
peculiar ray, and gave him my script to read. He seemed to have
no trouble believing all that I wrote was the truth, so I told
him of my experiences with Christian ministers and counsellors.
It was his suggestion that I rewrite the paper, leaving out my

philosophies, as well as all religious overtones and the revela-
tion from God; then, I should send only the scientific facts to
interested physicists, astronomers, the Airforce, and others.
That perhaps I had begun the wrong way around, and that after
the facts and especially the ray in my eyes had been verified,
Christians might be willing to accept and believe that this
was no symbolic acting, no hallucinating, no imagining. I
felt great relief and came away deciding my friend was entirely
right. I would do as he suggested and I would also see a Psy-
chiatrist so men would know I was not insane.

Since it was not possible for me to get an appoint-
ment for several days, I had time to reconsider these decisions,
and instead of rewriting the account, I now write this Epilogue
for the following reasons. First, if I were to offer merely the
scientific facts and present my records, tapes, and my eyes for
experimentation, then I deny God. To ignore His part in the
whole affair is to be false to everything I've believed about Him
all my life. And I am not ashamed to state that I believe He was
and is my salvation. Second, if I go to be examined so that men
can be assured that I am sane and that what I have written is true,
then I mock God. He is the one who has used me as His tool, so
if I am a tired, old clay pot instead of a polished vase of brass
or pure gold, that is His business. He knows the Truth and He
knows that I have reported it with absolute integrity. Since
He is my judge, I can do no more.

O-bserver seemed sincere in telling his story. After he told me of his sighting I asked him to fill out a UFO Report form. The story he told me in my interview with him, matches the report he filled out.

I know this story also, so I'd like to give you some facts about him.

1. He believes in U.F.O.'s or flying saucers
2. He seemed scared of what he saw
3. He believes that the A.P. is hiding U.F.O. information.
4. I don't believe him to be a hoaxer.

P.S. A woman stated that her and her daughter saw an object that looked similar to the drawing of [ILLEGIBLE] Report (see 147) in 1957, at about 2:00 or 2:30 A.M. in Kentucky, about 7 miles from Hopkinsville (? mile ?).
