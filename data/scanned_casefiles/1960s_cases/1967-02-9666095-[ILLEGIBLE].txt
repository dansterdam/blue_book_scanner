2. LOCATION
AUGUSTA, GEORGIA
10. CONCLUSION (BRIEF)
It was concluded that the object was possibly a satellite which had not been previously observed or that it was a meteor.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers looked up and saw a bright light move from west to east. As it moved, it seemed to get larger and brighter. It then appeared to decrease in size and traveled toward the southwest until it was lost from view. Observer stated that it moved in a straight line and did not appear to be an aircraft. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute. No sound was heard. No physical evidence was left. Just appeared to vanish. Observer stated that nothing else in the sky was observed at that time.

There is no photograph present on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows a diagram with various angles and a compass rose, along with some text and instructions related to sketching the motion and direction of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. If the object dropped below the horizon, place an "X" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

EVALUATION

There is only one aircraft in the area bearing even the slightest resemblance to the craft reported. The past coast advertising Co.'s billboard advertising on Route 2A in Norwell, Mass., about 50 miles from this area.

Normally, I would have written this sighting off as a case of misidentification and evaluation as probably a helicopter or a jet, but there is enough about the sighting that does not correspond to conventional aircraft behavior to warrant giving a full report on this case.

1. The witness is familiar with aircraft. He works for Flying Tiger's, and as such, he regularly sees aircraft of all kinds. His impression was that whatever it was, it changed his mind. Whatever it was, it was not a conventional aircraft.

2. There was no noise, although the witness passed almost directly under the object's flight path with good visibility through clear, sunny windows closed. They make a rackety. 

3. The craft did not have conventional running lights.

4. The craft carried unusual and unconventional floodlight-type lights.

5. The craft hovered dangerously low over a main highway.

6. There was no sign of propulsion visible.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

Report of Investigation: 
Mr. [REDACTED]

Having called between the hours of 10:30 and 11:45 A.M. on 19 February 1967, at his home, Meggett, S. C.

To support the rather terse answers on the NICAP Form, the following:

Mr. [REDACTED] was driving home from work on Route 63, northbound on the evening of 15 February 1967. As he was approaching his home, he noticed a light in the sky, which he at first thought was a star, but as he continued to watch, it appeared to be hanging motionless and was a glowing, extremely bright light. He realized it was not a star and became quite aware of watching it closely. It appeared to be rectangular or extremely bright light. After watching it for some time, he became aware of a smaller object below the larger one and they appeared to be joined or connected. The smaller object appeared to be hanging beneath the larger one, but still some distance away. He watched this formation for some time and then they started to move off to the northwest and began to fade from view.

Prompted by my question about its light intensity, he indicated it was of such brightness that it dazzled or blinded his vision. Comparing it to a movie camera flashbulb, he said it was not that bright, but certainly much brighter than the headlights of a car which is close up, say within 40-45 mph. He opened his side window and put his head part way out of the car to get a better look, and he could not see any outline or shape but only the bright glow which was extremely intense. An air freight company had a familiar type plane off in the distance and the blinking lights of this plane were dull and insignificant in comparison to the object he was observing. He stated further that the object was larger or larger than the big "Huey" helicopters and there was nothing to indicate the size or distance, but he became concerned about the object's behavior and the manner in which it began to move off.

He attempted to look up at the lights as he drove under them, but it appeared that he could not see them clearly through his car windshield. After passing under the UFD and looking in the rear view mirror, the flashing red light was no longer observed on the approach from the south.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force study of unidentified flying objects.

Page Two

As he drove along, Mr. saw one car parked at the side of the highway with its parking lights on. Also, a car passed him on his right side, and the occupant of this car waved to him through his car window.

And driving home, Mr. phoned the local FAA office to report what he had seen, and he also called a local newspaper office to try to get information about the sighting. He did not succeed in getting any more information, and was told that there had indeed been several calls about a UFO sighting the previous evening, but was told that there had been no idea what caused these. 

Mr. wife was present at the interview, but she busied herself with some items, and did not appear to be a stable, well-adjusted witness. No further comments. Mr. appeared to be a stable, well-adjusted witness, and he had no difficulty in being interviewed. There were no childish, immature or a little embarrassed to be involved, but willing to cooperate provided the information would be forwarded to OFFEN and the Director, OOAMA, for appropriate action.

Although he was keenly interested in UFO's, as evidence by his contacting the FAA and local newspaper office, he felt that an investigation should not be made on the basis of his report alone. He said he is afraid of being classed in that category if his friends found out that he had reported a UFO sighting.

Here is the text of the letter as an OCR output:

Re: UFO Encounter 
Dear Sirs:
It is my understanding that most reports about UFOs contain religious connotations, therefore your UBO case cannot be dismissed as mere superstition. I must confess that part - described - incident was largely publicity, and I cannot accept responsibility for any part of this to be published. 
I regret to say that I personally encountered nothing sensational or out of the ordinary. As you will understand, it is for the sake of others I do not wish to undergo rigid questioning or humiliation, and I will do everything in my power to travel person to be away from home for long or short period. Please let me know if that is convenient to you.
And don't forget I have only one set of the postmarks and will include the originals in my report to Dr. Hynek. I would be interested to know if your own copies compare with mine, as the existence of the sounds in them is vital to a careful investigation of me interference. I will keep you informed if there are any further investigations which may be called for.
There are no other facts which I did not include in my report. If you are really anxious to learn what I saw, I will be more than glad to answer them within reasonable limits, but I would ask you all for your patience in this matter. I await further word from you.

Sincerely yours, 
(Cir.) Morri

AN ENCOUNTER WITH GOD AND THE UFOS

If you have worried that "God Is Dead" - Rejoice! For He lives and reigns and has power over all, as He promised! And this is my humble testimony to His Almighty power. I had started to write an expose of the UFOS which are surrounding the earth, and I kept careful notes of the things which I saw and experienced. Now, I am unable to do that precisely as I envisioned because God himself, enters into my experiences. This is therefore, become a proclamation of His everlasting Love such as seemed could be revealed in the year 1967. 

I have started to write about an adventure which began in February 1967 and essentially ended the first of September but the end is not yet as you will see. The incident, the understanding which came too swiftly as a child in kindergarten, I could not understand how the teacher could tell me that "God Is Love" and then shake with hysterical laughter or perhaps mere nervous excitement as Catholic priests or German soldier's laughed, when I was eight or nine and heard the Minister preach of Christ, then damn all Roman Catholics; or maybe this incident in Germany where I watched American servicemen accuse Catholic officers of being agents of the Church by throwing tomatoes and rotten fruit.

I assured him when puzzled, that is in His heavenly as the Scriptures and therein I found the Spirit of the Christ which saved me from total desolation and despair.

In late years, I have had to evict a bitter part of this saying, but I cling to the first recession; and when in all my straits at Scort Camp Canada and have a sorrow of young accounts.

I devoured a dozen or more including these books; Project Report, all of Frank Scully's the accounts by the Lorenzens, the Adamski story, "sent at Exeter", "The White Sands Incident", Budd Are Not Alone" and several others. And all the time I was looking for some evidence of truth to them for I do not doubt that if UFOs had approached other simple to me that I ought to be able to see them too. I did not, as I sought to do, fully convince myself then too..

As it approached the plane I glimpsed a huge dull-metallic disc-shaped object far ahead of the plane.

Finally my witness one night in early March when the "star" became a great deal and disappeared in about half an hour.

Also a young man who chatted with me (it was after mid-night) the sighting prompted me to an official Air Force tion form for reporting UFOs. The form did not arrive several weeks later, and in the meantime so many other incidents occurred that I overlooked it.

Eventually my persistance in believing that not Jupiter paid-off for one night it moved considered to me and it seemed to my a small dim-glowing object hovered behind me at tree-top level. For several nights thereafter I attempted to find a place to achieve an even closer sighting of this UFO, but always with negative results. While I followed in my car. As if responding to my presence it led me in a very hilly area, some thirty miles east of my home. It descended to earth. The spot was an open semi-cleared land, and in my headlights' glare I could see empty the remnants of crude make-shift shelters. I was reluctant to get in close to this place so I drove on until I found an area where I could park and study the sky. When I had raised my glasses point of it, I discovered that not one, but stars were descending toward me at an angle slightly below the horizon.

The dim little object bobbed up and down at the far the the hill, and the two "stars" stopped moving about away from me and simply hovered there. In the bright lights I could not see that they changed they were. The two bright and white, while the other from ESC.

It certainly seemed probable that our American airforce or scientific interests have uncovered a strange but real encounter with a genuine hall, nor could any other earthly power would bother with a lone citizen like myself that whatever these objects were they must represented a profound interest. When I started to move toward saving my cigarette to them, they immediately began swaying and ascended in to the sky away from me, regaining in the manner and direction from which they came.

A few nights later when I cross about to the bathroom, I looked out of my window at the strange star which hunts about 45' 5 in the sky and to see it suddenly ceased being a star and was lifted in some strange ball that moved with great speed towards me. I looked back at the place where it had been and discovered that a yellowish but much diminished star was all that remained. Another brilliant white star descent towards me (always at an angle as though maintaining the proper distance from me) and illuminate several yards around me on this slight hill. sudden flash of a red-hot glowing ball that appeared to spring several yards beyond the previous one.

Shortly after this, I saw a very bright blue flash in the sky over to the right and the glowing ball was extinguished.

I have noticed too that the smaller stars (approximately the same magnitude and less) appear as distinct round discs in looking up into the starry clear sky. I can see only these tiny discs far, far distant from what I ever seen before. I had scheduled an appointment in Odontological office for dental 23rd, because I thought my vision had changed imperceptibly and that this may which puzzled me but I did not mention it because I really didn't know very much about it and foolishly thought I would eventually discover what this was which would be delighted or scientist to examine and experiment with it.

Never having studied Physics, I could not say that the ray they give before my eyes is similar to a laser when it strikes light at a distance. It has increased my peripheral vision so that I can see almost behind me, and I see reflections as if I could not before Possibly this discovery to demonstrate what I mean, I discovered this ray when I focus directly at an object, and I am focusing down, the camera lens picks up like to round balls and both of these phenomena negative and print of the picture taken.

I write this, the ray does bother me but for a reason I will explain later.
I suppose many will wonder why a woman fifty-four years old would deliberately expose herself to the dangers of driving alone far from her home to rendezvous with an unknown object in the dark - for one thing, I have done in the spirit of adventure - a seeking in the forest of life that confronted my grandmother in the covered wagon. When one has a perspective of history and considers the tremendous courage of the immigrants to America who crossed the continent in vulnerable boats, one feels a sense of incompleteness at times of ease and comfort and inaction. Also, age comes to struggle to overcome and erase innr fear, or someone may sit all companionless, and the course that requires courage that undertakes was indeed a child-like faith in the promises of God, clearly the testament of Jesus Christ. Therefore, my friends often considered my ways unorthodox, but accuse, I have refused to be squeezed into the viso-that makes more timid souls conform. Frankly I feel impure their narrow, dull and unguarded lives in deeds godiva kudos and approbation from their fellow men. a more full life than, I couldn't care less what might happen in the light of God's love I have given them. Thus, at only one time did I feel a real fear of quence in these seven months; rather it could be called a very peculiar excitement.

Curiosity, puzzlement, but not fear for so.
Another reason was that my teenage children, who were already on a serious study and mountainous homework. Evenings were with continuous reading and TV pap, and after being an office all day long, I enjoyed the excuse to be at-doors an intellectually study of Astronautics. I decided I needed for this adventure. (I also needed estroduced the lives to be the only legacy and of Astro-Physics, Biochemistry, but doubt that I now have promised this.) Lastly, at my age I have offered, the children were to the world. In my search for were geared by a studied Catholicism, Semitic Mohammedanism, Fundamentalists, the Stoics to try to first, why there were so many barriers between men constructive "Christian" and then, to learn of the man has come to an understanding of God or why some new together in their philosophies of life.

The following are the important things I have almost never seen mentioned or observed:

/ that first, there is not just one or two UFOs counted, as many as seven hanging around the horizon though they were stars or the first magnitude dazzling I have seen as many as six smaller dimmer ones which hover low in the skies. There may be a lot more, but this is the maximum count that I actually sight. All move at tremendous speeds but also a certain amount of undulation. They can turn and seem to disappear completely, but I have never seen them come back. Occasionally, they will just move above the path of flight, and sometimes they will follow for a while as if pacing the observer.

/ that secondly, they themselves can imitate a large, disc-shaped plane with the usual red and green lights, but with sound. I have seen a large, disc-move rapidly and glow outlining its shape when just overhead become a "jet" with running exhaust fumes streaming from its rear and with deafening whine of an actual jet, however, it is to be able to distinguish its undulation. Also a cylindrically shaped "plane" which looks like plane of earlier times and sounds like one is simply too big to be powered by any motor appear day or night out of nowhere. It has for me to see that it has no markings of any a dark stripe at its wingline. On bright days, it seems shiny too big to be some experimental aircraft.

shiny silver gleam, but on cloudy days looks very dim. That third, they seem to be able to manipulate electricity as they please. I have found my house to be powerless when I know there is electric power on. I have found radios blaring that were off. My doorbell has rung at 2 a.m., with no one there. Farm lights and street lights have been on in great regularity seeming towards the zenith, and the rays of light but in black rays too. Three times knowns have used light to make pictures for me, cloudy night: once appeared a huge lighted area of a tall tree across the meadow. It was like a TV screen and in front of it was the figure of a tall man, but it vanished in space. The object on light but with three dimensions, and the first floating in front of the screen. That same object area was used as a "screen" while two small figures appeared to be bobbing up and down in front of it. The third was similar to this last picture and I wish I knew if I was entitled to an important thing that they can do anything they please with sound. 

If I knew anything about physics, I suppose they may not be separated from light and electricity, but because of distinct things that happened. For that a cricket near me in the grass did not move in rhythm as other crickets around the yard, and I realized it was a sort of dot-dash code. Tone of the horse coda when a young scout but never realized that they can do anything they please with sound.

Send it with skill, so I bought a dog whistle too to disturb human ears and tried to learn the Ñ.

But when the unknowns, or rather their devices, come late night hours my dogs do not bark or yip, but sort of half-cry in a high pitch. That lastly whoever I taken someone with me nothing distinguishable happens excepting for than I was with a beloved friend on the Atlantic summer. She watched a bright star move from over to hover outside our motel window which looked as also she experienced the "frogging" one night when out on the beach, as well as the dot-dash tapping sort about our motel. Besides the skies were clear I could not see the stars, but she watched the street light suddenly send rays (light and black ones) off if it were a powerful searchlight. She also experiences phenomena with me and that is when I am out in dark driving, no matter how still the air, some leaves from a bush or tree will start a "ripple" quite unlike the way wind moves leaves. I hesitate but I do feel it is some sort of controlled energy if I had not seen so acutely tuned-in to sight as their moves have noticed at. With the exception some very oddly-lit fireflies in early summer (my cousin's vacation I was alarmed) I have never seen any conductor.

On my return home I was busy with family so out much the first two weeks of August. But I a couple of new publications about UFOs, one of which stated that the occupants and the other which stated that the occupants were from outer space. I tried to analyze the first of meetings which people on earth had had and decided that they would be more like the loving creatures described by acknowledged experts in religion-science com unications. So it was near mid September first near meeting came. I had gone to a remote walked from my car to a huge unused pasture beyond the bluff. A UFO which hung in front of it could come towards my peripheral vision caught eight of the tiny red lights down amid trees on the far side of the pond not where I was parked. I was apprehension and I didn't want to distinguish the pond while the night insects star din like I'd never before heard. This was one that deeper than apprehension and I didn't want to panic.

The text on the page describes an encounter with a mysterious "cloud" or object in the sky. The observer mentions taking their children to a drive-in theater on August 30th, and while there, they noticed a cloud-like object moving in the sky. The object seemed to move in front of a trail of trees, and then the sky darkened as the object disappeared. The observer describes trying to understand what they witnessed and wondering if it could be a UFO.

On August 30th I took my children to a drive-in theater invited to attend, and I drove out to my favorite field which was still lighted. It was still light: 6:30 P.m. so I could see nothing of stars or objects.

The field has a quite high elevation and as I looked up the countryside I was a white cloud. It was not a contrail sky. But the "cloud" which was above another field of a mile away moved to the front of trees which bordered them and I could see more clearly. But with no lights of any sort. It made several starts then after about fifteen minutes the sky darkened with a increasing was appearing, so I went back home. On last say of August the "cloud" I described previously.

I arrived in an isolated area where I had never been and was slowly driving up following a gravel road and certain that at the top I would find where the "plane" could land. But as I arrived a few friends of my boy joined me with care and bicycles. They were carefully parked and it was not a junk yard as I first thought was "by God, these are cars of others", seen closely as I crept on. I heard a cry in English, "C'mon, - - - - -" and looking across that far I suddenly glimpsed a large group of people who were guns on the first legal day for Dove Hunting. That was Friday, and all day and night I was there, the tapping which signaled "Come Out".  It continued end Sunday, but I was busy and did not go till Monday very early Labor Day and decided to try in the dark days' activities began.

It too had fishermen parked directly, and wilderness was concealed miss of the stream. Choosing to walk down better than wade through poison ivy, I kept hidden from somewhere in the trees to "go on". I walked the wild, listening and looking at the sky but a while. Finally after I had rounded several curves and my soaking, I stopped to examine some fascinating for in the rocks along the edge of the stream. I was

Therefore, I came to some conclusion regarding such irreverences for day considered Holy, and was really the one day of the week we got together and spent more time in order to continue the routine of daily living (and time, it was a great daily living). From all the evidence supernormal knowledge and from their delicious sense of just about decided that they were from a super civilization had prepared far beyond ours on earth because they wanted to see them down as we did; that very likely they were with our custom of worship on Sundays because an such atmosphere they just worshipped God around the clock (worked with Him) and had no need for special days and had to enter into and direct their lives as He had it considered the possibility that man's Fall and the original sin might be a punch of physical hogwash which had from discovering this, those countless powers and demon of his talents. I wondered if there a God after my background of seeking, I had to return to the first unknown came from Him or at least, with the cavern around earth's heavens.

So I answered that I truly had not been playing but I wanted to know who they were and where they came from. Then they said, "No son, I firmly decided that I wanted to brave a meeting and have the whole business done, no matter what." When I got to the fishing pond, a calm came upon me with young people. As so I drove to an isolated place I came across some railroad tracks. I parked and was walking down to get away from the road when I heard a pounding noise.

As I have written, I had turned to God for help and in Him was my safey and He promised. Therefore either the unknowns were "one too.', or I was about to "B Un" with something, something I did not really care to contemplate what it was. At the way I was not even from God. I decided not to stay there that night and went back home to search the Scriptures what was written there about other worlds, to see any clue she relationship of the unknowns to this world. Unhappily I did not find any satisfactory, although Christ's statement: "Other Sheep have I to be brought," may allude to the spoke of more than 1 race.
I also noted that He referred at another place tb his "angels" And I read the story of Christ's temptation. I really never had understood. Also, there came dispute I had had with my minister when in a study concerned the Apostle Paul and whether or not he knew of any other worlds. I had found a reference in Timothy that Paul would speak in Church nor held office and the explanations were not given.

Of course, I never thought such admirable character when he succumbed to Eve's - but I began to wonder if the existing displays of power between men and women becoming so ideal for man really tried to act in a very friendly way towards the one he so referred to them as "my friends". The whole too many to figure out I decided I would just have faith that since God had protected me thus far, He would continue to so so.

The cows roared and seemed near panic and I heard some strange sounds that seemed like soft muttering or buzzing. I walked on into the deeper darkness and could see dim shadows moving in the distance - at this point I increased my grip on the Testament and felt I was definitely not alone in this strange place. The shadows seemed to move away as I approached and after a time I could see nothing at all but the stars in the sky. It was then I noticed a peculiar silence - no sounds of night birds, insects or the usual country noises one hears on a farm. The silence was oppressive and I felt a strong sense of foreboding.

dash rhythm which spells "Go On - Go On - Go On" getting used to this racket, a man's voice started yelling and howling and you couldn't tell where it was coming from. It was like a cheer leader urging a team to victory a terrible urgency which stunned me! While I didn't want to confront it, somehow I did feel conscious of a presence was used instead of my name. I tried to look to see if I could see anything at the old farmhouse where I am sure this activity was taking place. It was then that I am sure was the curtains flared up so brilliantly I could see its glow from where I was. It was then that farm and others farther away began the wort, loudest and wildest yelling ever. The beings would seem to crouched down and then it would spring up and down and they would the yelling and the dogs; then, it would start again.
I was chilled in my tracks, but finally I wrote with in the air: "I am not afraid because God is with me, those poor dogs I" Then I took my hew testament a further and leaned it against a light pole which stood just to one side.
Next I took the flashlight and beamed it around the the unknown was flickering and then let it shine on the after that I came straight home.
The next day was rainy and dreary all day. Wonders all that they had picked up the ball it easy, or if it was merely lying there rain-sogged. At 4 p.m. I had to go out! So I drove in pouring rain to the spot and found the bible near where I'd left it. It was wet, but not open to Proverbs 3. I brought it home and read and pondered. For the 19th verse says: The Lord by wisdom hath established the earth; by understanding he hath established the heavens. Surely it would seem the unknowns were His and I needed to ponder them.

I did not go out again that night but after I had come into the house started bumping and shaking as if my girl was doing a wild watusi. As the disturbance continued I could see the drapes moving and I started to them to stop the noise, making no noise! The younger was already in bed and already was fixing her hair in the bathroom and neither had been out.

I could only guess that we had some manner of rate. I went back to bed and was nearly asleep when the disturbance started on my mattress. I really didn't feel like continuing this argument with the force and suddenly I heard, 3-x's and I came fully awake to the rest which went like this: "Jesus is Savior -- We know -- He has shown His sheep -- I am but a Savior -- Savior is in His heaven." Will you can/mm tress and anguish? I have never considered myself to be a sample of Christian and in times past the lusts of the flesh and once had been on the verge of a habitual smoker, have sworn like a stevedore and with myself as a witness I can testify that I have a niche in the farthest corner of Heaven and truly Christ was what He said He was - the Son of God and gives us coming to be as pure and a message of clay - when - such a message to me? Incredible and completely astounding!

Finally went back to bed after pacing my room for half an hour, my trusty little 38 put the whole business out of my thought. Saturday, September 8, I was busy getting other had no time to think more about the matter until after 24 hours. There was to be a funeral at our village church and I debated whether or not to go first because I was not impressed by the strange happening the night before.

It only served to make me cry so much the privacy of his closet where he might find solace far from the Holy Spirit. Well, all this was going my head as I emptied a vase full of dead flowers and into it, carefully, so the rain I did this already ringed and full of water sat in the adjoining the water in it began to move and swirl around. I realized the faucet and hastened to turn it off that before.

as a man. His eyes were more slit-like and I could hardly see a mouth, but his nose was definitely the snout of an animal -- maybe a dog or a cat. It was not very pretty! I stood there frozen, for there were no more pictures and my mind was churning with confused thoughts.

I looked all around the inside of the glass dome and did not understand. All I could see now were the leaves from the top of a tall tree sticking out in the yard where the dome rested. Glass and trying to find an answer. Suddenly, a tiny yellow light appeared on the other side of the glass from where the being had been. It looked for the source of the yellow light, but it was not shining then, and I realized it came from a reflection on the window sill. But by all laws of reflection, I should have seen more than a tiny flash -- I should have seen the substantial outline of my personality dissolved for the appearing of the light. Slowly it became stronger and stronger until it looked like an eye in the manner of a wrap around a face, but I thought then that it must have some reference to vision, to some understanding or unseen that I had seen. I tried to reason that the unknown living creature was as the portrayal of an all-loving God, and yet to me the sight was unwelcome. When his Death Camps were exposed, this thought did not seem true. What was Christ doing with all those men who were infirm? And infamy? And torture? And to those in Plesau's famous painting "Guernica" which found no answer, and I pushed away the thought that these could come from God Himself. It was too overwhelming to believe.

An encounter
Putting my quandary aside I went to the funeral to watch with equanimity, but in my state, my passion kindled at the gross manner in which the whole business had been handled, and when friends who visited me later expressed like feeling, the indication was only kindled, and after they left, I rather burning letter to the minister. Then, since I could stand it no longer, I thought of going into court and asking the court that more upsetting than his cold funeral was all the sustained in the past few years- And i could go to share with him like that. 'Savior gather me in your sheep', but finally after 45 minutes of anguish and sorrow I reach this man, i thought I heard him say to, about that I need to understanding of but the knowning I had him before. I hung up more upset than ever and want to meeting place I has had with the unknowns. I took my little car and I went to find all that. As I walked from the car towards the center of the that an unused gravel pit, I began to grasped in more that don't I it to me didn't seem to be a a like man. All the while the sky, and although it was not really the appear, quite visible all through the zenith to about 45 degree's two circular objects, not far from these lights two are large mercury lamps and the third a strange one. I knew from past experiences that the the acted as a warning signal to the unknowns around the people were near me and the gravel pit, the light to a very ordinary glow, but otherwise it gleamed terly than the other two lights. When jets or others near the area it was the signal used to warn all the unknowns.

danger. I had often wondered how they managed to escape any danger. I had often suspected that some device was used to manipulate the intensity of that particular lamp. Tonight I was in such a closet didn't have cared less.
Proceeding toward the interior of the house and hoping for an answer to my question: " Do you know from God ? " I was conscious that near my usual spot for observing were bending with a sudden wind which for a moment I thought they were surely land. But I paused to gain steady bearings at my feet and was startled at its tone and I was no dots, no ashes. I looked quickly at the stars all the notes and heavens had been covered with a filthy-looking haze. and just in time, I glimpsed a light in the distance fade away and go out completely. The second I realized that the power of God was what that my frienship had known were indeed like them.I had been shown who now had to hide themselves greater than their own. I walked back to my car certain that God had given me, one of the least of man, the understanding given me. 
I supposed this would be the end of the matter. Now I know the pictures were His work for me. It has recognized the Tiny Faith and the most precious symbols of Christendom.  I should never showed themselves when another human was near.

When I mentioned some things about this experience she wanted to know if I said I was "Peotio thingo" judged insane and that I had better keep still. We had an accident I have a tape recording of the "sounds" I hear some car. Because they were uncasing at night I would put my recircular under my pillow since I didn't seem to like tape-recordings and hoped that that might in some way protect me from them the next day, I found it contained my labored breathing to get to sleep and some of the dot-dash sounds I've callee, but tone-drop snore-like sensitive that I hear in my inner ear!

truly believe it was absolutely cool of God to use communication with which I was familiar. But the total experience the total overwhelming knowledge was so much the case; and if He cares enough to intervene in the single simple soul, here and now, how very much concern ought to bring to those who now believe He is such a god to those who have not yet found Him!

I never understood before now what in the world Luther meant when he wrote "A Mighty Fortress is Our God." I should have known there are great and who on earth had no equal. Though I can the scientific knowledge I sought, perhaps what I have learned will be of greater benefit to mankind in certain despair that I write this knowing many will perhaps hear but - one word herein, but I feel compelled to warn men though no one word believed powerful and malevolent forces acting upon us that Saturday afternoon.

EPILOGUE TO AN ENCOUNTER

A month has passed since that astonishing day, and it has been a turbulent enough interval. The facts of the observation were of little importance, I report to all manner of Christians to read, and on the two occasions minusters I went to consult with a man ed in his profession of Pastoral Counseling. Sorrowfully his cold manner, his questioning attitude to my statements utterly confused and baffled me. Those who had such knowledge of this subject were merely helpless, and I scarcely felt that they had a certain wisdom, the man immediately I suppose you have wisdom ? I was dumbfounded, and had no questions of any kind whatsoever. My reporter, I simply did not see how I could be expected objective reaction at all. I felt that had questioned was rather that I wanted to it has been acting out symbolically all the needs in a certain pattern, and that I might do well to see a Psychiatrist, if I could find one which would emotionally turn by the events which had been happened, but not quite so much devastated by this man. Somewhere in all our talks, I had quoted Christ (John 14:20): "At that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you." To this he replied that he did not seem to know anything about it.

saying certainly had an element of "sickness" in it. I also realized that man with great knowledge of the human organism never really understand the human spirit. And I had the strange feeling that the people around Jesus always misunderstanding the compassion which Christ gave His disciples and persecuted Him for fear of being prescribed queer and unnatural.

Then, when I remarked that Christ had said, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do," it was brought to my attention that the quote was not from the New Testament, but from the Old. I hastily suggested that since it was in my Bible, it could fairly be in his, so I read him the passage from my Bible and also told him of another verse in the New Testament (John 10: 34), and on hearing it, he shortly admitted that I had simply misinterpreted the text. There were no sceptics not even the courteous one who admitted that I had forgotten Christ ever used it. And I wondered why the translation of the Bible would not know precisely Christ's most celebrated sayings, not even the Son of God (John 1: 1). After the conference, the man said that he had never before heard of bitterness, and since I couldn't tell him I was rather consumed with grief over the fact that he, like many of my colleagues, has been so foolish as to regard it simply as some morbid mental state, I would follow his suggestion to see a Psychiatrist.

I went immediately to my scientist friend, and me earlier in summer with the peculiar ray, and gave him my script to read. He had no trouble believing all that I wrote was the truth of my experience with Christian ministers and their peculiar disease. It was his suggestion that I rewrite the paper, leaving out the names of the individuals involved and change their spiritual sickness to physical illness, which I did.

philosophies, as well as all religious overtones and quotations from God; then, I should send only the scientific interested physicist; astronomers, the Airforce. That perhaps I had begun the wrong way around, and the facts and especially the ray in my eyes had been Christian, might be willing to accept and believe was no symbolic acting, no hallucinating, no imaginative, just great relief and came way deciding my friend alright. I would do so he suggested and I would also chiastic so man would know I was not insane.
Since it was not possible for me to get treatment for several days, I had time to reconsider the said instead of reaction, I now write for the following reasons. First, if I were to offer scientific facts and present my records, tapes, and experimentation, then I deny God. To ignore this whole affair is to be false to everything I've believed all my life. And I am not ashamed to state that I am and is my salvation. Second, if I go to be examined as arranged that I am sane and that what I have is not then I mock God. He is the one who has used me as if I am a tired, old clay pot instead of a polished or pure gold, that is his business. He knows that I have reported it with absolute integrity. He is my judge, I can do no more.

Transcribed text:

Dear Sir:
I have listened to your request and have given it some thought.  I realize that this is a very unusual situation and I do not know how to handle it.  I was awakened the other night by a bright light which shone through my window.  At first I thought it might be the moon, but it was much brighter and seemed to be coming in through the window.  I got up to investigate and saw a strange object hovering in the air outside.  It seemed to be a large, metallic craft of some kind.  The light was quite blinding and I had to shield my eyes.  I watched it for a few minutes before it suddenly shot off at tremendous speed.  I am not sure what to make of this experience and I am a bit shaken by it.  I would be interested to know if you have had any similar reports in this area.  Please let me know if you have any advice on how I should handle this.  I do not wish to become the subject of ridicule, but I felt I should report what I saw.

Sincerely yours,
[Illegible signature]

Dear Lt. Fritzmann,

I would like to report on the force investigation in reply to your request.

The two cases under investications, while having the threads of similarities, are still rather unclear. The threads of investigation are not yet complete, little is still to be desired in the absence of these facts in order to lead to any conclusions, This is primarily due to the necessity of confirmation of the examination, which are now in process.

There may be available additional information, which I have not been made cognizant of, I await your further directive in this matter.
