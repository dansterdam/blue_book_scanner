The rest of the handwritten text is difficult to fully decipher due to the handwriting and image quality. The page is marked as "Page 7" and has the number "65" in the top left corner.

The handwritten text appears to be a narrative explanation, but I cannot confidently transcribe the full text without potentially introducing errors.

Dear Sirs,

I hope you will give this sighting some consideration, even though I am 15 years old.

On March 31, 1967 between 10:45 and 11:00 EST someone called my father and said "So you have a red light moving over your house". I look outside and showed a light moving slowly from west to east. No noise was heard. My father, brother, and I watched it until it could not be seen. The light gave a very bright red. The light did not seem to blink, but rather it pulsated. Gradually the light got dimmer until it faded away. I waited for it to reappear, but I did not see it again that night. But someone else did.

The next day another person told us that see thought it was a helicopter, but she was not near it. She stayed out longer than I did. She says that it did not appear and when it did, it did blink. At no time did it illuminate anything else in the sky. She two persons that saw the object besides myself were Richard Purnell and Helen Zigler.

Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten text appears to read:]
The UFO went in straight line and then at a higher height
and higher gaining altitude and they disappear
in the clouds and not coming out of the clouds.

For three nights between 9:00 and 10:00 at its earliest at 8:00, I saw the same or similar object that looked like might identification lights on an object I could not see. The lights were blinking. I would have been convinced it was a plane, but it went at a rate to west direction, stopped, and went back over it went south, and disappeared on April 1, 1967 between 9 and 10:00. The night after that it did not go south, but it did everything else at 8:00. Please investigate this object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching? If so, how?
From about a 25° angle it started slowing down slanting it's form going to a hazy light trail of white-pink red and then to red as if a signal light and disappeared behind the trees. I could see it quite.

Friday march 24th 1967

Off at 7:57 pm. On big and dark night a large bright surface then a low flying and quiet one 250 yds at side it was just about my neighbor's post. I saw it for about 2 minutes, pan of its right back to the window, and it let slowly move up further away to about 40° angle to my right. That rocking up and down, back and forth to that time. I could see the state police and gave him a description of what I was watching, give him the wrong direction in which I was writing. This was at the light of the tower. I did not know this, but the tower I was actually seeing is the new local television tower in Bognah, and not the one on Mt. (Hill Radio Tower) like I thought. This place probably included the Officer log telling them I could pass the U.S.O. in the vicinity of that mile 4 corner. And then to the window sill fly that low, my husband gets home from a supply truck. He does look through the windows, and agreed that it got like something else than a star but was not interested enough to watch any longer. Finally.

Got binoculars and made change app. to the right of the tower. turn around came back and watch it up near Rich Gully Course, left about 5-1 minute, longer like a pocket it started showing like a long trail in the most beautiful colors of yellow and red. then appear as red as a stop light. after gave change and busypass using the to the left of the tower, at about 8:40 p.m. went til 9:00 p.m. and come home. at about 12:30 p.m. after it again, right where it appears the first time. as big bright limit seemed higher.

To Case Capt Dudley - 79 MCG

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] Aug 2, 67 (Sightings Mar 29 & May 10,67)

Dear Mr [redacted]

Reference your recent letter in which you reported your unidentified observations of March 29 and May 10, 1967.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, etc., are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your nearest military installation is:

910 Troop Carrier Group
Youngstown Municipal Airport
Vienna, Ohio 44472
phone: area code 216; 374-1551 ext 258

The information on your unidentified observations will be added to our present data base.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the AirForce.

The objects usually moved in pairs and two of them came close enough to town (Crooksville) that I could see the shape. But they were usually too
