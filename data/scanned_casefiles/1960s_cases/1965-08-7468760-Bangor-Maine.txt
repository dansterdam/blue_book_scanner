LOCAL WEATHER, HIGH THIN SCATTERED, VISIBILITY 12 MILES NO UNUSUAL WEATHER PHENOMENA IN THE AREA. PART VII: COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER. AT 0224Z AND 0225Z A KC 135 AND B-52G MADE A WATER ASSISTED TAKE OFF FROM DOW AFB USING RUNWAY 33. THEY PAGE 3 REPORT 32 UNIAS WERE AIRBORNE AT THE TIME FOR THE SIGHTING. THEY WERE CONTACTED BY THE UNIT COMMAND POST AND DID NOT REPORT ANY SIGHTING. A CREW WAS DEBRIEFED UPON RETURN AND DID NOT NAME ANY INFORMATION TO GIVE PERTAINING TO THIS SIGHTING. THERE WERE NO OTHER LOCAL AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. BANGOR NORAD SECTOR WAS CONTACTED AND THEY WERE NOT CONDUCTING ANY ACTIVITY IN THE AREA. A DIRECTIONAL PLOT OF THE EXHAUST FROM THE TWO DEPARTING AIRCRAFT WOULD PLACE THE SMOKE, GENERATED FROM WATER INJECTION TAKE OFF IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE OBSERVERS. LOCAL RADAR STATIONS REPORTED NO CONTACTS IN THE AREA AT THIS TIME. TOWER WAS CONTACTED AT 0224Z WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. SINCE THE SURFACE WINDS WERE LIGHT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE JET EXHAUST TO HANG IN THE AIR FOR SOME BEFORE BEING DISSIPATED. TENTATIVE EVALUATION OF THIS SIGHTING IS THAT IT WAS A REFLECTION ON JET EXHAUST HAZE OR LIGHTS ON AMUSEMENT RIDES AT THE STATE FAIR GROUNDS. OFFICER PREPARING THE REPORT. LARRY K. ASBURY, CAPT.
