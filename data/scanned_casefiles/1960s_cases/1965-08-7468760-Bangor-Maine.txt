LOCAL WEATHER, HIGH THIN SCATTERED, VISIBILITY 12 MILES NO
UNUSUAL WEATHER PHENOMENA IN THE AREA. PART VIII COMMENTS OF
PREPARING OFFICER. AT 0224Z AND 0225Z A KC 135 AND B-526 MADE
A WATER ASSISTED TAKE OFF FROM DOW AFB USING RUNWAY 33, THEY
PAGE 3 RUEADP 52 UNCLAS
WERE AIRBORNE AT THE TIME FOR THE SIGHTING, THEY WERE CONTACTED
THE UNIT COMMAND POST AND DID NOT REPORT ANY SIGHTING A CREW
WAS DEBRIEFED UPON RETURN AND DID NOT NAME ANY INFORMATION TO
GIVE PERTAINING TO THIS SIGHTING. THERE WERE NO OTHER LOCAL
AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. BANGOR NORAD SECTOR WAS CONTACTED AND THEY
WERE NOT CONDUCTING ANY ACTIVITY IN THE AREA. A DIRECTIONAL
PLOT OF THE EXHAUST FROM THE TWO DEPARTING AIRCRAFT WOULD PLACE
THE SMOKE, GENERATED FROM WATER INJECTION TAKE OFF IN THE IMMEDIATE
VICINITY OF THE OBSERVERS. LOCAL RADAR STATIONS REPORTED NO CONTACTS
IN THE AREA AT THIS TIME. TOWER WAS CONTACTED AT 0240Z WITH
NEGATIVE RESULTS. SINCE THE SURFACE WINDS WERE LIGHT IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR THE JET EXHAUST TO HANG IN THE AIR FOR SOME BEFORE BEING DISSIPATED.
TENTATIVE EVALUATION OF THIS SIGHTING IS THAT IT WAS A REFLECTION
ON JET EXHAUST HAZE OF LIGHTS ON AMUSEMENT RIDES AT THE STATE FAIR
GROUNDS. OFFICER PREPARING THE REPORT, LARRY K. ASBURY, CAPT.
