DONNYBROOK, NORTH DAKOTA 
8 AUGUST 1966

On the evening of 8 August 1966, at approximately 2230 hours, a local resident of Donnybrook, North Dakota reported seeing a UFO near his home. The witness described the object as circular in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and hovering about 100 feet off the ground. The object was said to emit a bright, pulsating light that illuminated the surrounding area. 

The witness observed the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. No other witnesses were reported, and no physical evidence was found at the scene.

This incident was subsequently investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO study program, but the case remains unresolved. The witness's account and the lack of supporting evidence make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the nature of the observed phenomenon.

k. Position title and comments of the preparing officer: CHECKED AS PHASE 3 PROJECT: USAF, BASE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS - Comments: ON 23 AUG 1966- USAF BASE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS was interviewed and the case was determined to be NON OF INTEREST. THIS SIGHTING WAS RESOLVED TO BE THE REFLECTION FROM BRIGHT MOONLIT CLOUDS. HE WAS NOT SEEKING PUBLICITY OR SENSATIONS AND THAT HIS OBSERVATION THAT NIGHT WAS SINCERE AND IN GOOD FAITH. THERE IS NOTHING DEFINITE TO SUGGEST THAT THERE WERE TWO (2) SETS OF THREE (3) FLASHING LIGHT OBJECTS OBSERVED, NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHED FACT THAT THESE LIGHTS WERE SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND THAT AN AIR FORCE CREW CHIEF AND OTHERS SAID THEY SAW THE LIGHTS FROM THE HILLSIDE FROM THESE DEPRESSIONS APPROXIMATELY TEN (10) SECONDS BEFORE THEY WERE OBSERVED ON THE BASE. CREDIBLE MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO HAVE OBSERVED THE PICTURES OF THE AREA AND WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH WILD GEESE, WILD DUCKS, AND OTHER FORMS OF LIFE COMMONLY OBSERVED INDICATE THAT OBSERVATIONS OF THESE REPORTS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED EVIDENCE OF PHENOMENA UNEXPLAINED DUE TO ANIMAL LIFE.
1. Existence of physical evidence: See Atch 3.

When first sighted, object was on its edge floating down side to side about 10 feet from the ground. When it reached the ground it climbed up about 100 feet, still sliding on its edge. It recessed it flattened out and I noticed the "dome" on top. Over the trees the water vapor circled around moving to a stand still. After it landed, I did not touch the ground but hovered about 10 feet above the ground. It slowly tilted back on its 25 feet diameter and disappeared rapidly into the clouds.
