Conversation with Major Shaw, Minot AFB, Ohio revealed that there were no radar returns from the alleged UFO.

No additional information has been obtained on the sighting. Major Shaw felt that the individual definitely saw something most unusual. Witness seems very stable.

CHESTER A. SHAW, Jr., Major, USAF, Base Director of Operations. Comments on 23 Aug 1965: Interviewed and the area where the UFO was sighted was observed. Individual not inclined to be excitable or the type to relate wild stories. He was not seeking publicity as he stated that if his findings were published, he would deny any knowledge of the occurrence. In observing the area, nothing definite could be established beyond the fact that there were two (2) sets of three (3) each depressions in the shape of a triangle. Spacing between depressions in each set varied, from approximately 9Â½ to 12Â½ feet. In a swath from the hillside from these depressions approximately ten (10) rocks had been displaced from their resting place (rocks varied in size from approximately 12 inches to approximately 10 pounds). Personnel who have observed the pictures of the area and are familiar with wild game have noted that coyote (common in this area) make similar depressions in their nesting. It is also thought that coyote and badgers over turn rocks in the manner observed. Observations of this nature however, it is felt that the physical evidence (i.e., depressions and over turned rocks) are probably due to animal wild life.

1. Existence of physical evidence: See Atch 3.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

When first sighted, object was on its edge floating down side of hill wobbling from side to side about 10 feet from the ground. When it reached the valley floor it slid about 100 feet, still tilted on its edge, and moved across the valley to a small reservoir. Over the reservoir it flattened out and I noticed the dome on top. It hovered over the water for about 1 minute and then moved to a small field. At this point it settled toward the ground and appeared to be landing. It did not touch the ground but hovered about 10 feet above and about 250 feet from where I stood beside my car. It slowly tilted back on edge and disappeared rapidly into the clouds.
