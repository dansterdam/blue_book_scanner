April 28
Coloma, Michigan

United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs:

At approximately 9:13 p.m. on
Friday, April 27 I sighted a U.F.O.
at an approximate single of 60Â°
from within I first saw it. It
traveled parallel or seemed to
look that way to the earth.
I checked out all possibilities
of a beacon from our airport
and the spot was to judge
for a car light to emit. It
is unlike that either a new
aircraft is being tested or it
was a western from herpes soil.

Twin Fire Balls In Michigan

At 9:15 p.m. on April 27, 1962, Mrs. Fred Harris of Burt, Michigan, observed a brilliant green and speedy fireball with a tall which appeared half as large as the full moon. It was followed by another green ball of fire, slightly smaller, also with a tail. Both objects appeared to skim just above the tops of the trees which separated two lots. The witness said they were traveling "much faster than a plane."
