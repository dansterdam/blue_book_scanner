(11) Object first appeared as a settlelight and moved with terrific speed.

(13.6) As the object was traveling over towards us from the east I flashed my cell light at it, several times. When it stopped directly over head I flashed and saw. So several times just to see what would happen. At this point I had realized that it was noiselessly and I was very curious. It shifted a skent to the west, and was at about 75° angle from us, and stared again. Tim Weber from us, and shined a quiet search light at it and got a reflection at this point a faint fluorescent type light was sent directly on us with that I scanned, I had stayed on for about 5 seconds. I flashed another S.O.S. and a silent from what appeared as the point, flickered short series of flashes. Then the object took off.

(28) The speed of this thing was unbearable. It went from horizon to horizon (north to north) in no more than a minute. This was at the point where it was high enough to look like a satellite. I would estimate the size of the object as about a 40 foot diameter.

(35) We were watching for bears in an open dump when we first started the object. After that we were on the roof of the truck.

- page 11 -

Here is the text from the document:

NOTE: There are several minor conflicts in the description. One observer said the object was light off the object when it was directly overhead but another observer said it was 12 miles west of Alpena. The date of the observation is given in the original TWX is 11 September but both observers reported their forms stating that it was 12 September. Another point of interest is that another observer said it looked star-like at a distance they do not show any light on the object when it is at close range. The observers were near Lachine which is not miles west of Alpena (Lachine is not listed in back index of Rand McNally Road Atlas). This would mean that the observers were quite close to the Alpena area.

(See map). The observers also stated that they called a local police station who in turn contacted a radar facility. The name of police department and radar facility were requested from the observers but have never been returned. Another point of interest is the fact that one observer is very interested in UFOs and would like to make a career of UFO investigation. Dr J Allen Hynek was requested to comment on this case in November 1967, he has failed to forward any additional information as of 2 September 1963. Because information was requested of the observers but they failed to respond the sighting is being carried as Insufficient Data for Evaluation.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

IN REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THIS FORM:

@ IN ITS FARTHEST POINT, THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE VERY MUCH LIKE A BRIGHT STAR. BUT, AT ITS CLOSEST POINT, THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY A SOLID METALLIC MASS.

@ FLASH OR FLICKER @ AFTER WE HAD HIT THE OBJECT WITH OUR LIGHTS (VOLT SPOT) IT TOOK OFF DUE WESTWARD. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO STAY AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE UNTIL IT WAS APPROXIMATELY A MILE OR SO FROM US. OBJECT THEN APPEARED TO STOP COMPLETE (WE HAD ALL OF OUR LIGHTS OFF). SUDDENLY WE WERE IN A DIRECT BEAM OF LIGHT COMING FROM THE OBJECT. THIS LIGHT WAS NOT BRIGHT BUT MORE LIKE A SOFT FLUORESCENT TYPE OF LIGHT. HOWEVER, THE LIGHT WAS A STRAIGHT AND STEADY BEAM WHICH FOUND US WITHOUT SCANNING OR SEARCHING THE GROUND. THE TRUCK ON WHICH WE WERE STANDING WAS A DARK, ALMOST BLACK BLUE, BUT IN THIS LIGHT APPEARED TO BE POWDER BLUE.

@ ALTHOUGH THE LOCATION OF THE OBJECT WAS ALWAYS KNOWN BY US, THE LIGHT FROM THE OBJECT DID GO OFF FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND SEVERAL TIMES.

@ AT ITS FARTHEST POINT, A MATCH HEAD WOULD HAVE COVERED THE COMPLETE OBJECT. HOWEVER, AT ITS CLOSEST POINT, A MATCH HEAD WOULD ONLY COVER A VERY MINUTE PORTION.

@ DURING THE TIME WE WERE WATCHING THE OBJECT, WE NEVER SAW ANY SIGN OF VAPOR TRAILS. HOWEVER, AFTER THE OBJECT STOPPED RIGHT ABOVE US, I THOUGHT I HEARD SO SLIGHT HUM, BUT I AM NOT POSITIVE IF IT WAS COMING FROM THE OBJECT.

@ AT ITS FARTHEST POINT, I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT IT WAS 10 OR 15 MILES EAST OF US.

Here is the text from the document:

(228) WE WERE SITTING IN A PICK-UP TRUCK FACING EAST. WHEN I FIRST POINTED IT OUT TO MIKE, WE WERE VIEWING IT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. WE THE GOT OUT AND WATCHED THE OBJECT FROM THE ROOF.

(22) WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE OBJECT IT WAS ABOUT 15 DEGREES OVER THE EASTERN HORIZON, HOWEVER, WHEN IT STOPPED OVER, IT WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 65° WHEN IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT. IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT INTO THE SOUTHERN HORIZON. WHEN WE WERE TALKING TO THE STATE POLICE ON THE MOBILE TELEPHONE THE OBJECT REAPPEARED COMING FROM THE SOUTH. IT CAME IN SIGHT AT ABOUT 10° & CAME AS CLOSE AS ABOUT 45° BUT LET HIGH THIS TIME. WE FLASHED OUR LIGHTS WHEN WE NOTICED IT, BUT THAT AS CLOSE AS IT CAME. WHEN WE SAW IT WHILE TALKING TO THE POLICE, THEY CALLED RADAR. SHOWED NO SIGN OF ANYTHING. IT THEN DISAPPEARED FOR GOOD INTO THE S.E. HORIZON ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE CONSERVATION OFFICER APPROACHED.

SENT UP S.O.S. SIGNALS FIGURING THAT IF IT WAS AIR FORCE, OR PRIVATE VEHICLE, THE S.O.S. SIGNAL WOULD BE REPORTED, BUT THE S.O.S. WERE NO REPORT OF S.O.S. COMING FROM THE GROUND.

DEAR SIRS,

I AM PERSONALLY VERY INTERESTED IN THE STUDY OF AERIAL PHENOMENA. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION YOU COULD SUPPLY, WHICH WOULD HELP ME PURSUE A CAREER IN THIS FIELD. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF A COLLEGE DEGREE IS REQUIRED (IF SO, OWN TRAINING) OR IF THE U.S.A.F. HAS ITS OWN TRAINING PROCEDURES IN THIS FIELD. ANY HELP WOULD BE SINCERELY APPRECIATED.

P.S. ANY FINDINGS FROM YOUR INVESTIGATION WOULD ALSO BE APPRECIATED IF POSSIBLE TO SUPPLY.
