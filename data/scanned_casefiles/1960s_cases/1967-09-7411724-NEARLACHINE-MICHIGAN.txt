THE BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers sighted an object that resembled a star at its brightest moment. When it was overhead, it looked like a thick grey metallic disc shaped object with runners on the bottom.

- page 1 -

The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a compass rose and instructions for the observer to indicate the position of a sighted object relative to the horizon and the compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 24 10 67
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
(1) OBJECT FIRST APPEARED AS A BRILLIANT SEARCHLIGHT
(13.6) AS THE OBJECT WAS TRAVELING OVER US FROM THE EAST OF TOWN, TIMES, WHEN IT STOPPED DIRECTLY AT IT, SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS OVER HEAD I STARTED TO GO OVER IN MY MIND WHAT I HAD OBSERVED AND I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOISELESS AND IT WAS VERY CURIOUS. 3 TO 5 MINUTES
TO SAY THAT IT APPEARED AND THEN SEEMED TO VANISH IN A SPLIT SECOND.
(2) THE SPEED OF THIS THING WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WENT FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON IN A FLASH, LIKE A SHOOTING STAR, AND AS IT PASSED, IT SEEMED TO BE HOLLOW INSIDE AND LIGHTED UP WITH A BRILLIANT LIGHT, BUT IT LEFT NO TRAIL LIKE A SHOOTING STAR. AS IT PASSED OVER, I GOT A REFLECTION AT THIS POINT, A PART FLASHLIGHT TYPE LIGHT, AS SOON AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, THIS LIGHT DISAPPEARED AND IT WAS GONE. 
I NOTICED A S-SHAPED CURVE OR WAVE IN THE OBJECT JUST BEFORE IT SHOT OUT OF SIGHT, AND IT SEEMED TO TRAVEL ABOUT 5 SECONDS
I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS THAT FRIGHTENED ME SO, BUT I KNOW THAT WHAT I OBSERVED WAS NOT NATURAL AND COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED BY ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF BEFORE.
(3) WE WERE WATCHING FOR BEARS IN AN OPEN FIELD WHICH WE FREQUENTLY DO, WHEN THIS OBJECT SUDDENLY APPEARED THAT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE EVER SEEN ON THE EDGE OF THE TREETOPS.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, containing text describing a UFO sighting report.

There are several minor contrasts or details in the image, but no discernible photograph or visual depiction.

Text output from the OCR:

"There are several minor contrasts in the description. One observer stated that the object when it was directly overhead appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The object seemed to have a dull metallic surface and was rotating slowly. The object hovered over the area for several minutes, then accelerated to the east and completely disappeared. Another point of interest is that the object was observed again on 13 September. Another point of interest is that the object was at close range. The observers were near Lachine, Michigan. The object appeared to be guided in its movements and seemed to be under intelligent control. (See map) The observers also stated that they called the local police station. Two cars from the local police department and radar facility were requested from the observers but have never been returned. Another point of interest is the fact that one observer is very interested in UFOs and should like to make a careful investigation. On 7 November 1961, he has called information but was told that no additional information was available from the Air Force. To respond the sighting is being carried as Insufficient Data for Evaluation."

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

SEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS FORM: PART 1
(1) THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT OUR EYE WAS A DISTINCT GLOWING LIGHT, VERY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE A SOLID METALLIC MASS.
(2) PASSING EXTREMELY CLOSE TO US, WE FEEL THAT IT HIT THE OBJET WITH A LIGHT BEAM OR SOMETHING AS THE LIGHT SEEMED TO PASS COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT FROM US WITH OUR EYES. EACH TIME IT DID THIS, IT TOOK ONE OR TWO SECONDS.
(3) THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF LIGHT, ALMOST LIKE THE GLOW FROM MOLTEN METAL. THIS LIGHT WAS NOT CONTAINED BUT RATHER SEEMED TO BE EMITTED FROM THE OBJECT.
(4) AS THE OBJECT NEARED US, THE LIGHT COMING FROM IT SEEMED TO FLUCTUATE CONSTANTLY AND IN IRREGULAR INTERVALS. IT WAS NOT STEADY BUT RATHER VARIABLE IN ITS INTENSITY.
(5) AT ITS FARTHEST POINT, A STEADY HEAD - WOULD HAVE COVERED THE COMPLETE OBJECT. HOWEVER, AT ITS CLOSEST POINT, IT WOULD ONLY COVER A VERY MINUTE PORTION.

DURING THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION, THERE WAS NO SOUND WHATSOEVER FROM THE OBJECT. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO WINGS, TAIL OR APPENDAGES PROTRUDING FROM IT. IT SEEMED COMPLETELY ROUND OR SPHERICAL IN SHAPE. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION IF IT WAS COMING FROM OR GOING TO ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION, AS IT MOVED FROM POINT TO POINT IN A SEEMINGLY RANDOM FASHION.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is as follows:

(226) WE WERE SITTING IN A PICK-UP TRUCK PARKED 
ABOUT 200 FEET FROM THE ROAD, JUST WATCHING THE LANDSCAPE. SUDDENLY THE WINDSHIELD WENT UP AND SLID BACK, EXPOSING US TO THE AIR. WE WERE SHOCKED.
THE ROOF THEN WAS PUSHED UP ABOUT A FOOT AND STOPPED. WE COULD SEE THROUGH THE ROOF AND WITNESSED SEVERAL SHAPES MOVING ABOUT.
THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OVAL IN SHAPE.  ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CAR HOOD. IT MOVED DIRECT TO US, THEN IT STOPPED ABOUT 65 FEET IN FRONT OF US. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE WINDSHIELD WENT UP AND THE ROOF STARTED TO GO UP.
A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. WE COULD HEAR A FAINT HUMMING SOUND. 
AS CLOSE AS WE WERE, WE DID NOT FEEL INTENSELY HOT OR COLD, JUST A VIBRATION THROUGH THE TRUCK.
SUDDENLY THE OBJECT ROSE STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 2 OR 3 SECONDS. WHILE IT WAS THERE WE COULD SEE THROUGH THE ROOF. AFTER IT WAS GONE THE ROOF AND WINDSHIELD RETURNED TO NORMAL.
WE STAYED IN THE TRUCK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE CONSERVATION OF FUNCTION WAS RESTORED.
SENT TO S.O.S.

DEAR SIRS,
THIS STUDY OF AERIAL PHENOMENA IS OF GREAT INTEREST AND FASCINATION. THE DOCUMENTATION YOU COULD SUPPLY WHICH WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND THESE OCCURRENCES IS URGENTLY REQUIRED. OUR TRAINING PROCEDURES FOR U.S.A.F. OBSERVERS MAY HELP WOULD BE SINCERELY APPRECIATED.
IT IS KNOWN THAT FIELD STUDIES COULD BE APPRAISED IF POSSIBLE TO SUPPLY.
