FORKS ADS, GRAND FORKS AFB, N.D. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS
SERVATION INDICATES THE SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY AN UNUSUALLY LARGE
METEORITE OR SIMILAR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY
EXISTS THAT THE SIGHTED OBJECT MAY SUBSEQUENTLY BE IDENTIFIED AS A
MOON DUST SIGHTING. IN ADDITION TO THE OBSERVERS NOTED IN THIS
REPORT, NUMEROUS UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE SEEN THIS
OBJECT FROM THE GROUND. VARIOUS CIVIL AIRCRAFT LANDING AT HACTOR
AIRPORT, FARGO, N.D., REPORTED SEEING THIS OBJECT AT VARIOUS POINTS
AS MUCH AS 150 MILES NORTH AND SOUTH FROM FARGO, N.D. INCOMPLETE
INFORMATION ALSO INDICATES THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT MUNICIPAL
AIRPORT, DULUTH, MINN. AND BY THE US COAST GUARD OFF THE
SOUTHERN SHORE OF LAKE SUPERIOR. ALL THESE SOURCES, AS FAR AS
AN BE DETERMINED, AGREE IN TIME AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION WITH THE
TWO OBSERVERS IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT.
PARA: L. NONE.
