NORTH OF THE TURNALLY. THIS DISTANCE IS NORMALLY COVERED IN APPROX- IMATELY 3 1/2 MINUTES. P.M. 1440(HOURS) CHERRY, INTELLIGENCE PROJECT, 5TH BW (XSAC), BLYTHEVILLE AFB, ARKANSAS. THE MOST LOGICAL EXPLANA- TION IS THAT THE OBSERVER SAW ONE OF THE KC-135 TANKERS INVOLVED IN THE ORBIT. THOUGH THE TIME INVOLVED DO NOT CORRESPOND EXACTLY, CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FACT THAT THE OBSERVER TIME WAS ESTIMATED. INQUIRY AMONG KC-135 CREW AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL INDICATES THAT THE KC-135 AIRCRAFT IS EQUIPPED WITH A FUSELAGE-MOUNT- ED WING ILLUMINATION LIGHT WHICH IS TURNED ON AT VARIOUS TIMES TO FACILITATE OBSERVATION OF THE WING AT NIGHT. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PATTERN FOR THE USE OF THIS LIGHT. THE PREPARING OFFICER OF CREWS IN CLEAR WEATHER OVER BLYTHEVILLE AFB BY A KC-135, LATER IDENTIFIED AS CREW 45 ASSIGNED TO THE 97TH ARS. THE KC-135 WAS OBSERVED FROM AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 3/4 MILE POSITION AT A BIROZIC OF APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF MILE. THE ALTITUDE OF THE TANKER WAS ABOUT 4,000 FEET. THE OBSERVER STATED THE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED BY HIS C.O. W.D. P.M. 141(CLEAR) NOTE.
