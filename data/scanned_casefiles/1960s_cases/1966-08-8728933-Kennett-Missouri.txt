The shared image appears to contain a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The image shows a typed document, but there is no visible photograph or image within the document itself.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

AND IS DATED AUGUST 19 33 . THE SUPPORTING TANKINGS TOOK OFF TO THE SOUTH AT 7:40 P.M. 4 MINUTES AFTER INITIAL SIGHTING. A DISTANCE OF 2 MILES WAS COVERED IN APP ROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES. 

A PILOT AND 4 SUPPORTING TANKERES RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT AT 8:10 P.M. SUPPORTING TANKERS WENT OUT TO WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST AND TURNED BACK SHORTLY AFTER TAKE OFF.

SUGGEST THE FLIGHT RADIAL THAT THE HOUSINGS OBJECT WAS TRAVELING COULD NOT BE PRECISELY FOLLOWED DURING AN OVIT TAKE OFF DUE TO THE MOUNTAINS VERY NEAR TO THE POINT OF OBSERVATION. "FLIGHT" IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES SOUTH OF KENNETT, MISSOURI.

PAGE 2 STATES THAT "THE DISTRICT IS CLEARLY COVERED IN APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 4 KILOMETERS OF CLEAR MEDIUM ALTITUDE WISPY CLOUDS." THE OBJECT APPARENTLY MADE NO MANEUVER TO AVOID COLLISION WITH CLOUDS, AND THOUGH THE FLIGHT INVOLVES DO NOT CORRES POND DIRECTLY TO THE FORM OR APPARENT MOTION OF THE OBJECT, THE SIGHTING HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIATED. INQUIRY SHOWS NC-123 EVENT AND I AMINATION SHOW PROBABLE CAUSE THAT THE NC-123 AIRCRAFT IS EQUIPPED WITH A SLUNG-LOAD-TYPE EXTERNAL TANK. FACILITATE OBSERVATION OF THE LIGHTS AT NIGHT. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC REASON GIVEN FOR THE USE OF THIS LIGHT. THE SUPPORTING OFFICER OF CONTROL OF THE NC-123 AIRCRAFT IS AWARE OF A LOW PASSES IN CLEAR WEATHER, ON ELEVATION VILLE AND BY AMANNCLEAR LATER IDENTIFIED AS SGT. THE NC-123 WAS OBSERVED TWICE AS IT PASSED OVER THE TOWN AND WAS BELIEVED TO BE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SIGHTING. THE ALTITUDE OF THE TANKERG WAS ABOUT 2,000 FEET. THE RADAR RETURNS ON THE NC-123 WERE IDENTICAL WITH THE VISUAL SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT FROM GROUND BY THE WITNESSES. PLOT INDICATES G.C.
