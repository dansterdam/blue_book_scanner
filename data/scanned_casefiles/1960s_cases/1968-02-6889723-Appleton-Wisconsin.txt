We were told that strange objects were visible in the evening sky and were watching for them. When a bright light appeared, we watched it carefully. It seemed to ease straight up for a short distance, then move laterally, moving faster than anything we had ever seen. However, it seemed to lose its brightness for a while, then regain it. After remaining momentarily stationary, it started moving again, accelerating as it traveled. It accelerated at a tremendous rate, then reappeared somewhat dimmer, then moved at a very high rate of speed until it disappeared. The object appeared in the southern sky and was visible for about 5 minutes. We were unable to determine the exact size or distance, but it appeared to be a considerable distance away. We observed it and discussed it among ourselves carefully.
