1827 CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUILDING
HOUSTON 2, TEXAS

June 14, 1963

Commander Major Kolenda
OST Detachment 1004
Ellington Air Force Base
Houston, Texas

Gentlemen:

I am an american male, age thirty five years, residing in Houston, Harris County, Texas. I am a graduate Civil Engineer and a duly licensed and practicing attorney-at-law.

On the 14th day of June, 1963 at 9:57 p.m., I, accompanied by my wife, was observing the constellations from a point on the Jack Rabbit Road and the Katy Highway intersection of Jack Rabbit Road in Harris County, Texas; which point is roughly one and eight tenths miles west of the city limits of Houston.

At this time and place I observed what appeared to be a star situated approximately ten degrees directly below Polaris. This object was the same apparent diameter as Polaris and shone with a light slightly more intense.

At about this time the object began to move from point 1 (exhibit A) to point 2 shown thereon. This phenomena was also observed by my wife and her stretch phenomena was also observed less than one hour after our observations and without reference one to the other.

We estimate the total elapsed time from observing the object's first motion (pt 1) to its disappearance at point 2 to be roughly 38 minutes.

As regards motion: The object moved rather rapidly, but much more slowly than the velocity associated with a meteor. It apparently stopped once, a point A and B on the diagrams for periods of approximately twenty seconds without any corresponding loss of intensity during this halt.

As regards Apparent Brightness or Intensity:
The object appeared brighter or more intense at point 1 than at any other time during its observed journey.
Its' intensity seemed to diminish in a non-uniform manner until it was no longer visible. This fluctuation in intensity, while not uniform, was not such as could be characterized as "pulsating". Due to the fact that there was no observable, occurring time fluctuation associated with the variation in intensity.

In conclusion, you may be assured that this object was not an airplane nor was it any form of a "shooting star".

What then do you think it was?

Sincerely,

[Signature is blacked out]
