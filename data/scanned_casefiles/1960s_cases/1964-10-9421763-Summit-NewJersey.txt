The text in the document is as follows:

Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.
To Whom It May Concern:

During the fall of 1947, the United States Government "Project Saucer" under the authority of the Air Force due to the sudden rash of flying saucer reports. About two years ago, one saucer was disbanded and another project under another code name was established, "which is still in operation".

During Project Saucer's two years of operation it accumulated some four hundred UFO reports, each one being named numerically and given an account and summary of the findings which is not available to the public.

I realize our government is a very efficient organization, therefore I am led to believe that it is still being carried on of which I am interested in obtaining the files and summaries of cases 33, 144, & 172. If possible, to save both the Air Force unnecessary correspondence, please send any other back summaries. I would also appreciate a copy of the Air Force press release of December 27, 1949 and a copy of the Project Saucer report of 1949.

Dear Major Jacks:

In May of 1964 I inquired about the sighting of an unidentified flying object at Socorro, New Mexico (May, 1964). Just out of curiosity, I 
was told that this incident was observed by a local law enforcement officer.

At that time I was sent a briefing of the investigation. That was listed as unidentified and still being investigated. What was the final 
explanation given by officials from Wright-Patterson Field?

Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Jacke:

As you undoubtedly know, last evening, the 2nd of October 1964, a spaceecraft or unknown origin landed in a field in Broward County, Florida. The landing was witnessed by a local resident. 

The spaceecraft was approximately thirty feet in diameter, six to seven feet in thickness, and stood four feet above the ground on four (4) vertical supports or legs. When the object was observed, a "being" came forth from the object. This object was described as approximately five feet in height and wore a helmet. The creature brought forth an object similar to a book and took two readings or readings of the ground, and when doing so, the object or paper-like material. After the draft departure, the material was picked up and reported the sightings to the authorities.

Investigators from the Air Force base were sent to interview Mr. [redacted], and the loss of the craft left four impressions in the dirt which showed it to be an on-the-ground analysis of the cloth showed it to be an unknown material. The writing on the cloth has not yet been deciphered.

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text describes details related to UFO sightings in the Binghamton - Endicott area of New York.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI (Major Jacks)
WADDC 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. ---- of Binghamton, N.Y. requesting information on UFO projects. Previous correspondence on this subject has been received from Mr. ---- in May and June of 1964. The following information is in response to his request:

Dear Mr. ---- :

Your statement that the Air Force receives over 100 reports on UFO sightings is incorrect. The Air Force receives only a small fraction of the total UFO reports. The sightings in the Binghamton - Endicott area during April and May 1964 were reported to NICAP, New York City. The Air Force has no additional information about the sightings and all of the reports were determined to be natural phenomena.

A resume of the sightings is as follows: An aircraft flying from southwest to northeast with red and green lights; an aircraft flying from north to south with red and green lights; a bright meteor from west to east with a red and green trail; and a bright meteor from northeast to southwest with a red and yellow trail. None of these sightings were attributed to UFO's. The natural explanation is that they were aircraft and natural phenomena.

Sincerely,
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Subsystems

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your statement that the Air Force UFO investigative unit is a cover-up is quite true. The incidents you mention about the UFO sightings near New York are interesting. The Air Force investigator apparently was not able to find a natural explanation for the sightings. A pattern or the sightings is as follows: Lights were observed to the north with rapid movements northeast to southwest. Some of the sightings were from northeast to southwest. Some sightings were from northwest to southeast. Another witness to the north saw a meteor-like object pass overhead from north to south. These sightings occurred on 17 September. I would then suggest that you contact Major Jack Vacca, USAF, Chief, Data Retrieval Office of information, Clearwater, Florida.
