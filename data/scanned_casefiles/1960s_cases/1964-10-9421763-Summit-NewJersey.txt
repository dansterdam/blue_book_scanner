I would also appreciate a personal official statement issued by the present commanding officer of Project Blue Book regarding the views of the United States Government toward Unidentified Flying Objects and interplanetary visitors.

If possible, kindly forward this letter to the Secretary of the Air Force for his personal statement.

Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience,

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your letter of June 4, 1964, in which you request supplemental information on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

The Air Force Technical Information Sheet is furnished only to those persons who desire to report a sighting. The Electronic Data Sheet is no longer in use. The procedure previously furnished you is the official statement of the Project Blue Book officer as well as that of the Department of the Air Force.

There are no photographs of Unidentified Flying Objects available within the Air Force for dissemination. Those photos which were submitted for analysis have been evaluated as common objects, flaws in the negative, or hoaxes, and all have been returned to the senders.

Sincerely,

This is in reply to your letter of February 8, 1965.

The current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects, is attached for your information. This report contains information on the program since its origin in 1948. This project has been known in the past as Project Sign and Project Grudge; however, it has never been known as Project Saucer.

To Whom It May Concern:

During the fall of 1947, the United States Government established "Project Saucer", under the authority of the Air Force, to investigate the sudden rash of flying saucer reports. About two years later, Project Saucer was disbanded and another project under another code name was established, namely "Project Bluebook", which is still in operation.

During Project Saucer's two years of operation it investigated some four hundred UFO reports, each one being named numerically. For each case, an account and summary of the findings was published and made available to the public.

I realize our government is a very efficient organization, and therefore am led to believe that it still has records of such summaries. I am interested in obtaining the files and summaries of cases number 33, 144, & 172. If possible, to save both the Air Force and myself unnecessary correspondence, please send any other back summaries available. I would also appreciate a copy of the Air Force press release of December 27, 1949 and a copy of the Project Saucer report of April 27, 1949.

Dear Major Jacks:

In May of 1964 I inquired about the sighting of an unidentified flying object at Socorro, New Mexico (May, 1964), just outside the White Sands Proving Grounds. The object was observed by a helicopter pilot and a local law enforcement officer.

At that time I was sent a briefing of the investigation, which stated the case was listed as unidentified and still being investigated. That was nearly eight months ago. What was the final explanation given by officials from Wright-Patterson Field?

Dear Major Jacks:

As you undoubtedly know, last evening, the 2nd of March, a spacecraft of unknown origin landed in a field in Brooksville, Florida. The landing was witnessed by a Mr. [redacted], a wealthy, local resident.

The spacecraft was approximately thirty feet in diameter, six to seven feet in thickness, and stood four feet above the ground on four (4) vertical supports or legs. When the object landed, a "creature" came forth from the object. The creature was described as approximately five feet in height and wearing a glass-like helmet. The creature brought forth an object similar to a camera and took two photographs or readings of Mr. [redacted]. The creature then returned to it's ship, and when doing so, dropped a cloth or paper-like material. After the craft departed, Mr. [redacted] picked up the material and reported the sighting to the authorities. Investigators from MacDill Air Force base, Tampa, were sent to interview Mr. [redacted].

The legs of the craft left four impressions in the ground.

An on-the-spot analysis of the cloth showed it to be made of an unknown material. The writing on the cloth has not yet been

The unidentified flying objects were picked up on radar at the Washington National Airport Control Tower and the Civil Aeronautics Authority building. They were also visually sighted at Andrews Air Force Base and by Jets attempting to intercept them.

Dear Major Jacks,

I'm writing in request of all available information regarding the reports and sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects referred to by the Aces as (Flying Saucers) over the Binghamton-Endicott, N.Y. area during July, August and September, 1964. I have heard accounts of the Air Force sending over 100 men into the above mentioned area to investigate the sightings. If you do not have any details at your disposal, kindly inform me of the name & address of the chief investigator, and the name(s) of the Air Force Base(s) from which the other investigating units were dispatched. The done intensive investigation myself on these sightings and I would now appreciate hearing the official U.S.A.F. findings. The Air Force has certainly had enough time for investigation, and the issuance of a primary report of these sightings to the public.

Please: every time I write the Air Force regarding UFO's, I get a run-around. All the Air Force sends me is a Project Blue Book pamphlet regarding sightings through Feb. 1964. I demand the bare facts on these sightings — not the usual run-around. Dr. Donald H. Menzel, Director of Astronomy at

1. Reference the attached letter from _______, requesting information on unidentified flying objects. Previous correspondence has been received from him in May and June of 1964. The following is a suggested reply to him:

Dear Mr __________:

Your statement that the Air Force sent 100 men to investigate the Binghamton - Endicott UFO sightings is incorrect. The Air Force sent two, repeat two officers from Griffiss AFB, New York to investigate and talk to the witnesses and observers. There were no unusual about the sightings and all of the reports were determined to have been caused by natural phenomena.

A resume of the sightings is as follows: An aircraft flying from South to North with red and green lights; and aircraft from the Southwestern horizon with red and green lights; an aircraft flying from South to Northeast, Echo II; again; two jets flying through the sky from South to West; Part to East with red and green lights; a bright meteor streaking through the sky from South to Northeast; another meteor Southeast to North; an aircraft circling in the Northern Horizon; a jet flying Northeast to Southwest with red, yellow and green lights; another meteor, and then Echo I. As you can see, Tom, there is absolutely nothing unusual about these sightings. You can see all of these natural phenomena. With a pair of binoculars you could start scanning the sky after dark. With flying jets are difficult to identify without the aid of binoculars.

Sincerely,

2. Mr _________ has requested that a copy of the findings be sent to Mrs _________, Summit, New Jersey. It is suggested that a carbon copy of your reply to him be sent to Mrs _________.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your statement that the Air Force sent 100 men to investigate the Binghamton-Endicott UFO sightings is incorrect. The Air Force sent two officers from the Griffiss AFB, New York, to investigate and talk to the witnesses and observers. There was nothing unusual about the sightings and all of the reports were determined to have been caused by natural phenomena.

A resume of the sightings is as follows: An aircraft flying from south to north with red, white, and green lights; an aircraft on the southwestern horizon with red and green lights; an aircraft from south to northwest; Echo II; a jet bomber with red and green lights; flying northeast to northeast, Echo II again; two jets flying from west to east with red and green lights; a bright meteor streaking through the sky from south to northeast; another meteor southeast to north; an aircraft circling in the northeast with red, yellow, and green lights; another meteor; and then some. A few can see. There is absolutely nothing unusual about these sightings. You, too, can see all of these natural phenomena. With a pair of binoculars you could see part meaning the sky after dark. High flying jets are difficult to identify without the aid of binoculars.
