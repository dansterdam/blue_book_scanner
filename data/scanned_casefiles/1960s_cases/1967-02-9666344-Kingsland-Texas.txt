NOTE

DALLAS, TEXAS, CIVIL WEATHER BUREAU RELEASED A RADIOSONDE BALLOON 22/1733 CST. WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY WOULD HAVE CARRIED THE BALLOON IN A GENERAL SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION.

HICKAM, KINGSLAND, CAPTAIN, USAF, 75 TRW, TAC. THE BALLOON RELEASE FROM DALLAS, TEXAS COINCIDES FAVORABLY WITH THE REPORTED "SAUCER" DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BALLOON. THE EXTREMELY HIGH ALTITUDE TYPE OF BALLOON REACHES, AND THE REFLECTION OF THE SUN COULD POSSIBLY ACCOUNT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE OBJECT EVEN THOUGH THE SUN WAS BELOW THE HORIZON AT THE TIME.
