11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a light travel across the sky in about one minute. Observer compared the light to an aircraft light. The observer stated that only a light was observed. The object broke up into two different objects and changed color from a bright silver to a bright red. The observer said that he knew that it was not an aircraft because it was too high, and traveling too fast. Anyway he said that if it was an aircraft it would have heard something. He again stated that plane lights would be the closest resemblance to the alleged UFO.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. Only a light was at all times, and individual details are not clearly defined.

Dear Sirs,

I can't hold it off any longer, I've got to tell somebody. I saw a UFO.

1. I saw it October 30, 1966.
2. Time: 7:50 (estimate) P.M.
3. Time zone-Central-Standard
4. I was at about [redacted], Chicago Ill.
5. Object was in sight for 1 min. & 15 sec.
   a. Time in sight was determined by my estimation.
   b. Object was NOT in sight continuously. It dis-
      appeared then reappeared behind a couple of
      houses.

6. a. Bright, clear night.
7. a. Stars-few
   b. Moon-dull moonlight
8. a. Clouds-clear sky
   b. Weather-dry

9. The object appeared as a light.
10. A little brighter than the surrounding stars. I looked
    a. Comparing it with some common 5863 ft, it looked
    like an airplane light.

11. The edges of the object were like a bright star.
12. The object did stand still at one time.
13. The object did speed up and away at one
    time.
    c. It broke up into 2 separate parts.
    d. Gave off no smoke.
    e. It did change brightness.(from silvery white
       to a bright red)
    f. did not change shape.(remained in the shape
       of a ball all the while)
    g. Did not flash or flicker.
    h. Disappeared & reappeared behind a couple of
       houses.

13. It did disappear while I was watching it. The
    light turned out.

14. The object did not move behind anything at any
    time.

15. The object did not move in front of anything
    at any time.

16. a. Sound-none

17. It would have been about the size of a match-
18. both objects were circular in shape,moving
    northwest.

19. Estimate the speed of the object I'd say it
20. was traveling about 180 m.p.h.
    Again estimating I'd say it was about 1/2 mile
21. away.
22. I was outdoors when I saw it.
    I was near an airport, but I'm sure it wasn't
    a plane because it was too high, & traveling
    too fast anyway if it was a plane I would have
    heard it.

23. I was walking.
24. I observed it with my own eyes.
25. Plane lights would be the closest resemblance
    to the "thing".

26. It was at about a 45° angle all the way through
27. That is a picture first shows the motion to
    first, then the 2 objects make. Air beginning
    of path is where it travels out of sight.

[There is also a hand-drawn diagram with some annotations and arrows]

28. I have never seen anything like this before.
29. There was one person with me, so he saw the
    object. Is lives down my block. If you want to
    talk to him I will be glad to get information
    from him, & I'll try to have him write a
    letter to you.

[Address is listed as Chicago, Illinois 60626]

31. I don't propose to tell anything more about this event.
32. I completed this letter on Jan. 22, 1967
    I finished it so into bureau I was scared to tell
    anyone.
