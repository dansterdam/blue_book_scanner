To whom it may concern,

Several years ago I considered writing you, but thought perhaps you would be disinterested since my UFO sighting was so long agoâ€“in 1936, in Panama Canal Zone. However, to the last two years, I have been unusual circumstances, I have become convinced that I have observed a genuine UFO that deserved a serial number. I am, therefore, writing to you.

On several occasions, I watched an extremely bright light, in a circular pattern, travel from horizon to horizon, without noise or apparent acceleration. This light appeared to be some kind of flying saucer, or disc. I can describe this without any doubt whatsoever. I am a fairly well qualified observer but my qualifications are not mentioned here.

Two days ago, I phoned a news reporter to arrange a meeting with her to show her these pictures. At the same time, she told me that I would be unable to take any pictures, as the object had not been present in the sky at that time. However, I am able to describe my observations with a good deal of certainty. I had not known what to do with my pictures, and I am not sure I have them now.

I do wish to emphasize that the UFO problem is a serious one and I feel that the Air Force should be advised of my sighting, if only for the record. I was considerable disturbed further when I learned recently of the shutdown of Project Blue Book. I feel that the American public has a right to know what is going on, and the Air Force has a duty to pursue this problem with vigor.

If you do not wish to write, I know you're busy, and I feel that the UFO problem is certainly worthy of continued Air Force interest and investigation.
