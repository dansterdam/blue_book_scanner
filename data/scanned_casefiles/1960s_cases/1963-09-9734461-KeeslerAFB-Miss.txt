10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
"White(gray-gray) obj without specific shape or size appearing as a contrail only. Appeared to be a contrail coming from an invisible plane. Initial observation at 45 deg elev in ESE disappearing after 15 sec. Reappeared after 10 sec break bearing SE. Headed SE for 5-10 sec at which time it seemed to explode but not break up. Continued at 3 orig speed in a slightly downward trajectory. Downward loop increased and size became a cloud-like enlargement which persisted."

11. COMMENTS
Sighting at night about 1020 pm. Object not observed, however report was of contrails. Quite possible for a/c to generate contrails and not to be visible. (Handwritten note: (Illegible))

   (8) Sound - None.
   (9) Other pertinent features - Seemed like contrails coming from a plane which could not be seen.

b. Description of Course of Object:
   (1) Contrail.
   (2) Approximately 45° Elevation coming from ESE to WSW.
   (3) 25° to 30° Elevation at 125° Azimuth.
   (4) Both flight paths were straight.
   (5) Instantaneously to the WSW (reappeared about 10 seconds later heading SE) object headed SE for about 5 to 10 seconds, then appeared to explode. Object did not disintegrate at the time of explosion, seemed to slow down to about 1/2 of original speed, losing altitude with a slightly downward trajectory, then almost straight down, all the while appearing as an enlarging cloud until it lost downward motion. The cloud lingered for quite a while.
   (6) 25 to 30 second.
