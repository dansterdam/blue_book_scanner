Hollywood 28, California
January 11, 1967

Dear Sirs:

I don't know quite how to say or what or to whom to ask, except that on the afternoon of Friday, December 16, 1966, at 2:30 P.M. I was calling to Miss [redacted] who lives in a second floor apartment at the above address. .s I looked up to her window, I noticed to my right in the sky, two white oval shaped objects, moving quite fast but smoothly and steadily in a southwest to northwest direction. At first, I thought nothing of it, but quickly realized or thought that these objects weren't planes and called Miss [redacted] to witness what I was seeing. It was her opinion too, that the objects weren't planes. The objects seemed quite high as there weren't any distinct features other than their oval shape. One oval was leading and was about half the size in front of the other.

There was also about an equal distance between the ovals. The distance separating the ovals never changed during the entire period of time while we were watching. The time elapsed was about two to three minutes. The objects then vanished behind some tall buildings.

Not knowing who to call, I asked the operator if there was a U.F.O. office in her listings. She replied, "no", but thought the Air Force would be the best place to contact. I then called the Los Angeles International Airport Weather Bureau. They gave me the following information: at 2:30 P.M. there was a west wind at six knots. It was seven degrees at the airport, probably a little warmer in Hollywood. Visibility was seven miles horizontal, and there were no low clouds. After receiving this information I explained my reasons for calling. I was then told that controls were reported at 2:30 P.M. and that I would go out and look around to the sky. I told some base controls, "Okay, I did, and what I saw appeared to be what looked to be an hour old sky, written message, a long, wispy trailing snake like cloud, what I saw at 2:30 were two very distinct white ovals moving across a still and windless sky.

I am not at all sure what these objects were, but thought I'd report this information to your offices. Being very curious, I would appreciate any information on this subject forwarded, whether it being contrails or any other objects I might have seen.

Thank You,

The small drawing that follows is the approximate size and layout of the objects seen.
