Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am a very firm believer in U.F.O. One night before I fell asleep I looked out the window looking at the constellation + one of the stars started to move. It (turned) turned direction on a 90° angle turn. It then zigged, stopped + then started off again + then disappeared. This was the night of September 10, 1967 at approximately 10:05 P.M. The reason I wrote this letter is because just the other night Nov. 10, 1967 at about 6:30 PM, I not only saw it but + had my brother + three good friends to observe it. It was the same design as before - it looked like a star. One of my friends didn't believe it but now he is thoroughly convinced. My age is 13 + my friend is 12. We both have read a number of books pertaining to U.F.O. I've read "Letters to Project Blue Book" edited by Bill Adler, + "Flying Saucers - Serious Business" edited by Frank Edwards, + numerous magazines that come out at least once a month. I have no theory of who this could be (now)

We were walking through a dump when I was directed by the light of the moon. That is when I saw the small red lights. My friend indicated the star like object & then it started to move while the two red lights took off in the other direction at a fast speed. We then watched the UFO (star like object) for 15 minutes before it disappeared behind trees.

If possible would you send me any information. I picture it was a rare information on Project Blue Book.
