Here is the text I can read from the document:

The object

First notice while watching TV

236

with the sound per per in long sounds

Then it moved at this point until 2:00 AM
Then it disappeared for the rest of the night

The document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch/diagram with various annotations and arrows, seemingly describing some kind of UFO or unusual object sighting.


- page 6 -

Here is the text from the document:

1. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. WHEN FIRST SEEN, THE PHENOMENON IS IN ONE DIRECTION. TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A "N" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

2. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. THEN DRAW AN ARROW FROM "A" TO "B" THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LARGER SKETCH.

The document contains a compass rose diagram labeled "HOUSE" and two sketches showing a road or landscape with points A and B, along with instructions for marking the position and movement of a phenomenon.
