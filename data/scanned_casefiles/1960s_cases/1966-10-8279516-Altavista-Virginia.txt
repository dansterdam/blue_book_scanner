INVESTIGATORS REPORT

On 10 Oct 1966, the Wing Command Post at Langley A.F.Base received a phone call from Mrs. H_______, Virginia. "About 20 (twenty) sightings of U.F.O.'s in the last three weeks, all at night. Most recent at 2000 ED 9 Oct 1966, next prior 8 Oct 1966. No outline or shape observed, just lights. Usually brilliant white something trailing sparks. Sometimes now for Jet aircraft, sometimes too fast for subsonic flight. Never any sound detected. Usually low altitude, three to four thousand feet. [Reverse direction without maneuver required of airplane. Once, color of light was red. On several occasions lights were between ground observers and identifiable aircraft making nearby landings"

I called Mrs. _______ home on 11 Oct 1966. Mrs. _______ was not home but I talked to her daughter Mrs. _______ of the above address. Mrs. _______ also saw a U.F.O. on the 9th of October 1966. This Mrs. _______ statement: "Mrs. _______ had been driving on 7th street in Altavista observed between 2030 and 2100 an object described as the size of a basketball held at arms length flew in front of the car, at tree top level from east to west. No shape to the object and was described as a glowing white light. No sound was heard from the object. Object flew to the west, made 2 sharp turns, then "evaporated" (her word) Object sighted for around three minutes total." Mrs. _______ also stated she had seen other U.F.O.'s at other times.

I called Mrs. _______ again on 12 Oct 1966. I talked to her at length about her sightings. She is aged 69, runs a beauty shop and is a housewife. She seemed quite intelligent on the telephone and spoke at length in considerable detail. On the night in question, Mrs. _______ saw three U.F.O.'s three in a row one after the other for approximately thirty seconds total. Three different paths, two fairly close to the same path, the third was very different. They were all as bright as the brightest star only bigger. She said they were too fast to be a jet aircraft. Her house is situated on a hill, under the landing pattern of the Lynchburg Virginia airport. She stated she can recognize various types of aircraft on sight, and these were not aircraft. She also stated the people in Altavista have become accustomed to sightings of U.F.O.'s, and she can give the names of other people in Altavista who have seen U.F.O.'s. On the night in question the weather was clear, no clouds and no wind. When I had finished talking to her both hung up, and within three days she had given me more info. She said that she would be watching her television set, when little horizontal streaks would appear. Usually within a few seconds of this occurring, a U.F.O. would be sighted by her. She said the television provided the first clue to the presence of U.F.O.'s in the area. She said the little streaks were the same kind that appeared during cloud-to-cloud lightning, and were not the same as caused by faulty ignition on a car, or when an aircraft flew over.
