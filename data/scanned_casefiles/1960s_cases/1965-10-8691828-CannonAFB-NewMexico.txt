The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. It does not contain any photographs, but rather a detailed report describing an observation of an unidentified aerial object. The report indicates that the observation took place on 3 October 1965 at Cannon AFB in New Mexico. The object is described as an "Astro (Arcturus)" that was observed at an elevation of 20 degrees, with a reported azimuth of 290 degrees. The report states that the object size varied from that of a dime to a quarter at arm's length, and that it attracted the attention of observers. There is no physical evidence noted in the report.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:
