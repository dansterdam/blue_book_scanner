POSITION TITLE, AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER.
FRANK G. HARTMEN, JR., 2LT, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 2717SW.

COMMENTS: SINCE THE OBSERVER STATED THAT THE SIGHTING LASTED
25 MINUTES IT SEEMS THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SIGHTINGS
PAGE 5 RMJDAA3627 UNCLAS
THAN JUST THE OBSERVED SIGHTING. ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVER THE
OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY BRILLIANT AND MOVING ABOUT IN STRANGE PATTERNS.
THIS, OF COURSE, SHOULD HAVE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MANY PEOPLE.
THE OBSERVER STATED THAT THE OBJECT GAVE OFF FLASHES, IT GOT DIM
AND THAN BRIGHT AGAIN. THE DESCRIPTION THE OBSERVER GAVE
RESEMBLED THE DESCRIPTION OF A ROTATION LIGHT OR BEACON.
NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS.
