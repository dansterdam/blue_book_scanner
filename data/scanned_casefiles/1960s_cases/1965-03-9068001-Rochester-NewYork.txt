Dear sir;

We are writing to you on behalf of our study. We would appreciate any information and data you can supply to us concerning the reported unidentified flying objects. 
We would like some pamphlets on flying saucers and other phenomena that have been reported so we can study them. 
The object was moving slowly across the sky. It was too far for a little and it had no evidence of any means of propulsion. At one time, I saw a little light on the object. The time was approximately 13 1/65 and the time was 7:15 p.m. The place was in my town. We just wanted to relay this information to you. We would appreciate anything you can supply on the subject.

Sincerely,
Wright-Patterson air-force base

Sincerely Yours,
