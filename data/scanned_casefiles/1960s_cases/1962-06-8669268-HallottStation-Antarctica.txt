Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted in the                     3 August 1962
Antarctica

SAFOI-3b (Major Hart)
Wash 25 DC

1. On 7 June 1962 at 0105Z witnesses at Hallett Station, 72-20 S and
170-00 E observed an object which they described as brighter than a
first magnitude star. This object was sighted on a true bearing
approximately 250° from Hallett Station. The elevation was reported
to be approximately 30° and the object was observed for more than five
minutes. This sighting probably resulted from the misidentification
of the planet Jupiter due to distortion of atmospheric characteristics
in the atmosphere. The reported azimuth of the object and that of the
planet at the time of the sighting are very nearly the same. The witnesses reported the object moved slowly in a southerly direction which
is the same as the apparent motion of another when viewed from Hallett
Station at this time and date. At the time of the sighting Jupiter was
the brightest astronomical object, -2.0 magnitude, which could be seen
from Hallett Station. Jupiter's elevation at the time of the sighting
was less than five degrees, far from the thirty degrees reported by
the witnesses. It is the FTD opinion that the witnesses estimate of
the elevation was in error for they indicated that the object passed
behind a mountain peak and as far as can be determined the nearest
mountain peaks have elevations of less than five degrees when measured
from Hallett Station. It is probable that a strong inversion was
present in the area at the time of the sighting and that mirage effects
associated with this condition contributed to the sighting.

2. On 22 June 1962 at 0303 Z an object leaving a smoke or vapor trail
was observed from Detachment Alpha, Antarctica. The object was reported
to be brighter than a first magnitude star, white in color and to have
moved from a bearing of 340° to 345° at an elevation of 7°. The duration
of this sighting was approximately two seconds. This object was probably
a very bright meteor known as a Fireball. Fireballs are a rare class
of meteor, brighter than -3.0 magnitude, usually multicolored, often
leaving a very evident trail and are relatively long duration. The
trails left by these meteors appear as smoke during daylight hours and
during darkness display many colors. Trails left by Fireballs have
been used to study winds in the upper atmosphere, fifty mile zone, by
such eminent astronomers as Dr. Fred Whipple, Harvard and Dr. Charles P.
Oliver, University of Pennsylvania. Since these trails may persist for half
an hour or more, it is not unusual for them to be distorted by these winds.

It is concluded that a fireball and the trail it generated was responsible for the UFO sighted from Hallett Station on 22 June 1962.

3. On 7 July 1962 at 1155 an intense light was observed from Hallett Station. This light was first observed from the roof of a building, and the observer stated that he thought at first it was a plane. In reported that the light was a large as a basketball and when it passed over the station he noticed two smaller lights appearing to the rear and the side of the main object. The main object was 12 times the normal light intensity and they maintained the same relative position throughout the sighting. The object left a clearly visible trail. The light was traveling from WSW to ENE. At 10° above the eastern horizon the object was off a brilliant flash and disappeared over the horizon. The object sighted by these witnesses was probably a bolide. Bolides possess the same characteristics as fireballs and in addition are heard to make noise, usually a whistling, rumbling, or series of explosions or is heard or seen to explode. There is the very remote possibility that this was the re-entry or the U.S. satellite Alpha-Beta I. Main characteristics decayed between 11002 and 23002 on 7 July 1962. Decay during revolution number 234 could have resulted in a diary mainly to be that described by the Hallett Station witnesses. It was concluded that this object was probably a bolide because: (1) Revolution number 234 was the earliest computed for the decay of the satellite and it probably decayed nearest to the mean of the computed time (2) The path of the satellite would have been more from the SW to the NE as viewed from Hallett Station, if of different characteristics, the to SW-NE path would have been emerging and (3) Though the witnesses provided only a limited description of the object they sighted, the characteristics are much closer to those of a bolide.

4. FTD is not aware of any United States or foreign activities which could account for the unidentified flying objects sighted in the Antarctic on 7 and 22 June 1962 and 7 July 1962. Further there is no evidence available which indicates that these phenomena were due to other than natural causes.

on 8 June at 07/010.2 the OLIC of Hallett Station in the Antarctic made an observation of an unidentified object described as a brilliant white light approximately 20 times brighter than a first magnitude star, the position of this object was at a 30 degree elevation and 250 degree heading. This placed the object between two mountain peaks of over 10,000 ft. to the Southwest of the observer. The sun was below the horizon at the time of the sighting. no

The light remained stationary for about 5 minutes, during which time the observer used 7X50 binoculars in an effort to gain additional details of the object. The light was described as a dazzling gold similar to that XXXXXXXXX of the sun's reflection from a polished gold surface. After five minutes the light moved in a southerly direction and disappeared behind a mountain peak and did not reappear. XXXXXXXXX This area was observed on succeeding nights in an effort to determine if the object would reappear XXXXXXXXX and no additional objects have been noted.

Attached are the report received at ATIC (Naval Message AF II : 4363 (11 Jun 62) and a section of GMC 25. GMC 25 or a combination of WAC's 1814 and 1815 would give better details, however they were not immediately available at this Command and is in 12 Jul this chart was sufficient for purposes of analysis.

Heading of 250 degrees is indicated. The mountains referred to in the message form a 50 degree angle, one peak being listed as 11,745 ft and the other as 10,249 ft/. No attempt was made to determine the distance from Hallett Station of these peaks, although the northernmost appear to be relatively close, and would give some indication of visibility between the peaks.

Page 1.2

The first magnitude star Formalhaut, in the position given by the observer, was not obtained. An inversion existed at the time, no weather report was included with the report since the format did not warrant such. The star would move as the result of a change in the Antarctic and the probability was that such a condition existed at the time of the observation. It is believed by the analysis at ATIC that this observation was a restriction of the star Formalhaut. The movement to the south corresponds to that which the star would take. The star would move at the rate of 1 degree in 4 minutes. Since the star was setting it would not reappear on the other side of the mountain. In its path the time element and disappearance, together with the impression that the object was stationary and then moved behind the mountain were sufficient reasons to make a further analysis.

No attempt was made to obtain additional information at this time or of race of the initial report and none has been made since that time, as it was felt that this case did not warrant the additional effort. To obtain information XXXXXXXXX extensive searches of the handling, outstanding data that the star would move (such as) disappear behind the mountain, distance of the mountain from Hallett Station in an effort to correlate the various bits of information in the area of the sighting XXXXXXXXX whether other stars were visible on that night or the succeeding nights. XXXXXXXXX To obtain impressions of additional witnesses of this observation. Also such questions as how was the angle of elevation determined? How was the time established? How familiar was the observer with observations of refracted objects? XXXXXXXXX

How was the diameter of 9-10 inches determined? What was the estimated distance of the object from the observer? Was the object stationary "near" or "away" behind the mountain? How was this time element XXXXXXXXX determined? Did the object change color from white to gold? Was it visible to the human eye or was the 7x10 binoculars the only means of determining its visibility to the human eye?
