The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a "PROJECT 10073 RECORD" with details about a UFO observation event that occurred on 29-30 Oct. 66 in Bellport, Long Island, New York.

The text in the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 29-30 Oct. 66 23OOZ
2. LOCATION: Bellport, Long Island, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: N/A
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: 2. W
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Astro(Capella)(Arcturus)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched star like objects in various parts of the sky. One object was in the NE and the other was in the WNW. The observers reported the objects as being stationary, although the objects did not disappear while they were being watched. One of the observers was occasionally contacted and on the night he was questioned, he was asked if he could see the object on Capella as the object he had been watching. He said he could and then pointed out the star Capella.
The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Capella was definitely identified as one of the objects the witness had been seeing.

Vertical temperature gradient: Normal

Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting: None

NEXT CALL THE COMBAT ALERT CENTER, EXT. 493, FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
Was radar sighting made? By whom?
Was intercept action taken?

Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting.

FINALLY, CALL GRUMMAN AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS SECTION AT 727-1500, EXT. 611, TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD ANY AIRCRAFT FLYING WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING.

Do not discuss the report with any civilian callers. Only the Office of Information, Hq. USAF, is authorized to release information concerning UFO reports. If you are called by members of the press, ask them to please call the Information Office, Capt. Craig at 293-2747, or his assistant, Lt. Campbell at base ext. 398.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document or report, featuring handwritten text.

The text on the page says:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of these reports. Turn to this form.

One final note: Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 495. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sighting than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.

The handwritten text at the bottom of the page reads:

After incident we are in search colors. Without clues to the incident still up.
