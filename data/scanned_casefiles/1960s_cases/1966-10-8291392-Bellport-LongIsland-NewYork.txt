11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched star like objects in various parts of sky. One object was in the NE and the other was in the western sky. The observers reported the objects as being white, red, and green flashing hovering lights. The objects did not disappear while they were being watched. One of the observers was personally contacted and on the night he was questioned he said if he could see the object on this night. He said he could and then pointed out the star Capella as the object he had been watching for several nights.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Capella was definitely identified as one of the objects the witness had been seeing.

Ceiling: Unlimited
Visibility: 8 miles
Amount of cloud cover: 5,000 Scattered
Thunderstorms in area and quadrant in which located: None
Vertical temperature gradient: None

Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

NEXT CALL THE COMBAT ALERT CENTER, EXT. 493, FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
Was radar sighting made? By whom?
Was intercept action taken?

Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting.

FINALLY, CALL GRUMMAN AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS SECTION AT 727-1500, EXT. 611, TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD ANY AIRCRAFT FLYING WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING.

[Handwritten note: "Nightly flying tonite"]

Do not discuss the report with any civilian callers. Only the Office of Information, Hq. USAF, is authorized to release information concerning UFO reports. If you are called by members of the press, ask them to please call the Information Officer, Capt. Craig at 288-2747, or his assistant, Lt. Campbell at base ext. 398.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 209-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
