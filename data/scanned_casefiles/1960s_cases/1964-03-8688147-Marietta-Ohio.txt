Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

My classmate and I are very interested in UFO's. We also have a debate in English on that subject, on the affirmative side. We know you are not permitted to reveal any important information to the public, but we thought you might be able to send us something regarding UFO's. Please send us any information you can or will.

On March 3 between 9:30 and 10:00 PM I looked out of my window and saw a bright yellowish object. I looked at it through binoculars and it was just standing still at about 290 degrees west of our house. My mother came to the window and we watched it for approximately 15 minutes then my mother made me go to bed, then after I went to bed I looked again and it disappeared and was gone. It didn't twinkle. I called the local newspaper office and they said perhaps it was Echo I or II. Do you know what it could have been?

Sincerely,

[Signature area is blacked out]

Dear [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of March 5, 1964, in which you reported seeing an unusual object.

What you saw was Venus which at the time you observed it, was at 280° azimuth. The planet, which has a magnitude of -3.7, will be visible throughout March, at night and at an elevation a little higher than at the time you observed it.

Enclosed is the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, which we think will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,
