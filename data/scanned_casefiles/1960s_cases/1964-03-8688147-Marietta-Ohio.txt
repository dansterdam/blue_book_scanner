Dear Sir:

My classmate and I are very interested in UFO's. We also have a date in Britain on that subject soon. We'd appreciate any information you can give us to aid with informative information to the public, but we thought you might be able to send us something regarding UFO's. Please send us any information you can or will.

On the night of March 2, 3, and until 6:00 PM on March 4, 1964 my mother and I looked out windows and saw a bright yellowish object. It looked at it through binoculars and through an instrument that standing still at about 230 degrees west of our house. My mother came to the window and verified what I saw. Then after a few minutes she kept looking again and it disappeared.

Sincerely,

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter from Maston M. Jacks of the Public Information Division, Office of Information, in response to a letter about an unusual object observed on March 5, 1964. The letter provides details about the Venus planet that was observed at that time.

March 13, 1964

Dear __________,

This is in reply to your letter of March 5, 1964, in which you reported seeing an unusual object.

What you saw was Venus which at the time you observed it, was at 89.9% of full illumination. The planet, which has a magnitude of -3.7, will be visible throughout March, & might and its elevation & a little higher than at the time you observed it.

Enclosed is the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, which we think will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
