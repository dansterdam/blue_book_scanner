                                UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

On 12th June, 1961, an unidentified flying object was
sighted by two residents of the Northern District. The District
Commissioner of that District has reported as follows:-

"The object was seen by Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] of Azarita
Plantation at 4 a.m., and for a period of about 15 minutes. They say
the shining object appeared high above the North East and was shaped like
the narrow in a new moon, and could have been delta winged. The ob-
ject was at an estimated height of 15,000 feet and kept moving back-
wards and forwards to and from the North East.

On one particular occasion it moved to the North East until it became
the size of a pin's head against the sky. Eventually it returned the
way it came. No noise was heard and only the bright object was seen.

Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] have travelled widely and he was employed by
the United Nations Organisation for some time. They may be considered as
being reliable."

2.   You may care to pass this report to the appropriate authority.

                                                             (D.M. Cleland)
