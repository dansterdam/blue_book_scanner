PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 17 March 1963

2. LOCATION: Crestview, Florida

3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 18/0145Z

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

5. SOURCE: Military

6. PHOTOS: No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 seconds

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: two

9. COURSE: West

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two objects delta wing shaped w/size of pea at arm's length observed in straight flight from East to West without maneuvers. Objects at 30dgr elevation. Similar to normal a/c formation. Appeared to be grey in that they were lighter in color than normal dark sky background. Similar in shape to F-102 but not necessarily size. Blended into darkness of sky.

11. COMMENTS: Extremely short duration. Dark night and two grey objects flew by. Two birds at 35' altitude would travel about 100' in 2-3 seconds, which is probably the limit of visibility for dark objects this size. Possible sighting of two birds.

12. CONCLUSIONS: Other (Birds), Insufficient Data for Evaluation
