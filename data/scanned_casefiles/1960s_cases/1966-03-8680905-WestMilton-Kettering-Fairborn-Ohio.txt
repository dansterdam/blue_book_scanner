PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 28 March 66 29/0030, C050&0355Z

2. LOCATION: West Milton, Kettering, Fairborn, Ohio

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Three Separate

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 Minutes each

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: SEB CASE FILE VARIED

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Not ECHO II or any of the PEGASUS satellites for which we have the schedules. However, there are over 30 satellites orbiting the earth which are visible.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: All objects were reported as being satellite like. A bright light like a star moving across the sky at a rapid rate of speed. The appearance, duration and flight characteristics are all coherent to those a satellite would have.
