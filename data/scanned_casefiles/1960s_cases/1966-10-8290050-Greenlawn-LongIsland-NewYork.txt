11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported viewing cigar shaped object that had three diamond shaped windows. He heard a slight humming and hissing sound during the observation. The object was hovering when it was first observed, then zig-zagged, then shot away in a straight path to the east.

Contact was made with the witness while Project Blue Book investigator was at Suffolk County AFB. Conversation with the witness revealed him to be unreliable. He appeared to be out to get his name in the various news media around the area. He told the local news media that Suffolk County AFB had told him that jets had been scrambled to intercept UFOs. When asked of this, he finally said that he was told by a friend. The witness has seen several UFOs and reported such to the Airforce.

I know at once looking at this thing it was no tiny minute this world, makes one's energy distinctly how showed at this my multi-colored lyric going at some beautiful light, my body was shivering - my eyes began to tear while I observed this.

I not guessed then - I go downstairs once tell someone of the time up the stairs to see it, it would be of one. However - I noticed it I thought of getting my binoculars to get a good look at it. I now know I have the one and I began to stare at I estimated this object to be about 200 feet above the ground and to my left. Surely under with him, his I was able to detect species of my eyes, some 207 at the type. It did not seem like some light of dome on top with a brilliant beam of how should it light dimming towards the sky. I calculate 45 seconds.
