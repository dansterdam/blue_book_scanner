10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Brilliant white, circular, between grapefruit and basketball in size. Color: fm a brilliant white light to a fierce orange color to a brilliant green-blue. When sighted angle of elevation estimated 60° 15' when disappeared. Obj. moved at very slow velocity in a straight line. Obj. disappeared with a brilliant green flash.

11. COMMENTS
Slow movement and flight path of obj. is characteristic of an astronomical body. Star Capella was in position reported for obj. and this star is a bright 1st magnitude star. Changing of colors was probably due to clouds and/or water spray which is prevalent around large number of islands in this area, and which would break up light into different colors.
