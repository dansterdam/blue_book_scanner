There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report on a UFO sighting that occurred on 7 Feb 66 in Tampa, Florida. The report details the observation of "Astro (STARS/PLANETS)" objects that were the color of chrome silver and were observed for 5-10 minutes. The report also indicates that the apparent motion of the objects would be caused by the motion of the clouds. The report is signed by 1 witness.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using OCR:

She is Mrs. Gertrude Collins and appeared irrational at the time of the interview. It could have lightened her distracted condition, it is believed, to have given her greater privacy from others (thought appeared as she describes - It seems unusual that to others the phenomena as did Mrs. Collins also have occurred quite irregularly in the past - Also, for the time being occurred due (the observer's backyard) but were different subjects each time a different phenomenon.

It is believed that due to Mrs. Collins age, 68, and living alone, she probably imagined she saw UFO's or that she have seen something of logical explanation that her poor eyesight interpreted.
