Dear Sirs,

I want to report the sighting of a UFO. I sighted it while lying in my back yard. It came into view at 6:05 pm, Friday, Sept. 13, 1968. It was out and white-gray. It was at a good altitude. It was going extremely fast much faster than any jet I have seen at that altitude. Its tail was curving as if it had no stabilizer. It disappeared behind the trees in view gone.

I am age twelve. My address is:

Huntington, L.I., N.Y. 11743

Sincerely yours,

P.S. My father (blacked out) a pilot, reported weather C.A.V.U.
