Multiple sightings from the Niagara Falls area. Witnesses reported to the Air Force by representatives of the press. Additional sightings were made from the area of Niagara Falls. The sightings were investigated by the USAF Project Information Office.

10. CONCLUSIONS
Was not a balloon
Was not an aircraft
Was not a satellite
Was not a meteor
Was probably a satellite returning to Jupiter
Family simmoned

11. COMMENTS
Durationlimited sightings from area. Initial investigation from witnesses. Probable cause was a satellite returning to Jupiter. These observations preceded the object observed for over an hour which left a long afterglow. This third object was determined to be a satellite which had a mag of 1.5 at 9:02.

Text extracted from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a man's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

UFO Over Western NY
A large, bright object was seen over western New York on July 18, 1963. It was first sighted at 9:30 p.m. as an extremely bright light approaching from the southwest. The object increased in size and much brighter. The UFO then abruptly stopped, then started up again, then slow down and float. Personnel at the Niagara Falls International Airport observed the object but had no radar contact. They felt the UFO was a weather balloon. Thousands of other people saw the object during good weather conditions.

UFO REPORT

TO: FTD (TD-2)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, Ohio

IAW AFR 200-2, the following report of a UFO, sighted 18 June, 1963 in Niagara Falls, New York is submitted:

a. Description of the Object:
(1) Shape - round.
(2) Size - size of pea held at arm's length (3 or 4 times bigger than largest star).
(3) Color - mainly a hazy bluish-white with flashing rods, greens and yellows.
(4) Number - one.
(5) Formation - none.
(6) No distinguishable features or details.
(7) No tail, trail or exhaust seen.
(8) No sound heard.
(9) No other unusual features.

b. Description of Course of Object:
(1) Observer first noticed the object going in a steady path from east to west (from 700 - 900) and then disappeared. This course took about 4 minutes. A second object appeared about where the first one disappeared.
(2) It appeared at about 70° above the horizon due east of the observers.

- page 28 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

(a) The observers stopped watching it before it disappeared.
(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers: The object moved from 72 degrees to about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon in a slight zig zag pattern in about six or seven seconds. At its point of stopping, for a minute and then in the same motion as before, it took the path for about 10 minutes. The path was like this [hand-drawn illustration]. It went straight out away from the observers, then it seemed to dart back and forth in a "zig-zag" manner. This final movement seemed to be in a steady path, not zig zag, as the descent and movement to the night seemed much slower than the initial movement.
(2) No one watched the object disappear from sight. It was still visible when they stopped watching.
(3) They observed the object for almost an hour and a half (90 minutes).
c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground - visual.
(2) Optical aids - binoculars. (7 x 50 stellar) with coated lenses and adjustable eye pieces.
(3) N/A
d. Time and Date:

According to the area astronomers there are no astronomical bodies that could account for such a birth of flight. According to the weather people in Toronto, the sighting was lost to view, there was no interception or identification action taken. The Cleveland and Syracuse interceptors reportedly noting the objects in the general area during the day of sighting but could not confirm visual contact.

The only balloon release during the day or sighting would have been the regular 10 a.m. release of weather balloons from the Buffalo and Niagara Falls.

Preparing Officers - 2nd Lt. Frank C. Oberkoetter: Information Officers (Colorado) contacted with local astronomers in Buffalo and they could not offer any solution. Neither the towers at the Buffalo or Rochester Airports received any reports of any flights which could be correlated to the sighting. The usual flights in the area at that time (17 June) as two men saw an object, bluish in color, moving in an erratic path, then it disappeared, then all the information to identify the object sighted.

There are no existing physical pieces of evidence of any sort that I know of. None of the observers took pictures.
