10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Various sightings from the Niagara Falls - Buffalo area were reported to the Air Force by a representative of the press. Additional sightings were made from the area of various a/c and several passes of ECHO were noted. The sightings were investigated by the local Air Force Information Office. (SEE CASE FILE)

11. COMMENTS
Multiple sightings from area. Initial object of 4 minutes duration moving West was probably a/c. A second object moving Easterly for about 10 minutes in a zig-zag path was probably ECHO. These observations preceded a report. This third object was determined to be Jupiter, which had a mag of -1.9J and rose at 0030z.

UFO Over Western NY:
A large, bright flying object was seen over western New York on July 18, 1963 at 9:40 p.m. It was described by observers as resembling such man-made satellites as Echo I for example, but appeared larger in size and much brighter.

The UFO took approximately 15 minutes to cross from horizon to horizon. Its direction of travel was from southeast to northwest. Odd flight characteristics were displayed as the object would speed up in its flight, then slow down and float.

Personnel at the FAA control tower at Greater Buffalo International Airport observed the object but had no radar contact. Because of the flight characteristics they felt the UFO was a weather balloon.

Thousands of other people saw the object during good weather conditions.

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: FTD (TD-3)
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

IAW AFR 200-2, the following report of a UFO, sighted 18 June, 1963
in Niagara Falls, New York is submitted.

a. Description of the Object:
(1) Shape - round.
(2) Size - size of pea held at arm's length (3 or 4 times
bigger than largest star).
(3) Color - mainly a hazy bluish-white with flashing reds,
greens and yellows.
(4) Number - one.
(5) Formation - none.
(6) No discernable features or details.
(7) No tail, trail or exhaust seen.
(8) No sound heard.
(9) No other unusual features.

b. Description of Course of Object:
(1) Observer first noticed an object going in a steady path
from east to west (from 700 - 900) and then disappeared. This course
took about 4 minutes. A second object appeared about where the first
one appeared. This is the UFO involved.
(2) It appeared at about 70° above the horizon due east of
the observer.


- page 28 -

(3) The observers stopped watching it before it disappeared.

(4) Description of Flight path and maneuvers: The object moved from 70° down to about 10° or 15° above the eastern horizon in a slight zig zag pattern in about six or seven minutes. It stopped for a minute or so and then in the same plane as its point of stopping, it moved to the right in a steady up and down zig zag path for about 10 minutes. The path was like this ____. Then it started back up and most likely out away from the observer because the light began to diminish in brightness. This final movement seemed to be in a steady path, not zig zag. The descent and movement to the right seemed faster than the final ascent.

(5) No one watched the object disappear from sight. It was still visible when they stopped watching.

(6) They observed the object for almost an hour and a half (90 minutes).

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground - visual.
(2) Optical aids - binoculars. (7 x 50 Stellar) with coated lenses and adjustable eye pieces.
(3) N/A

d. Time and Date:
(1) 03452 until 05152, 19 June 1963.
(2) Light conditions - night.

e. Location of Observers:
(1) Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] of the Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls, New York (this is 2 miles south of the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport.)

(2) Mr. [redacted] FAA Tower, Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Niagara Falls, New York.

f. Identifying Information on Observers:

(1) Mr. [redacted], sales engineer, reliability of statement is quite good, [redacted], Niagara Falls, New York.

(2) Mr. [redacted], newspaper reporter, reliability of statement is good if collaborated, Niagara Falls, New York.

(3) Mr. [redacted] Air Traffic Control Specialist (Tower), reliability of statement is good, FAA Tower, Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Niagara Falls, New York.

(a) Mr. [redacted] is a college graduate. His eyes checked out 20/20 during his last physical. On 1952 he took a 6 week navigation course in the Navy ROC program.

(b) Mr. [redacted] gave me the same details as did Mr. [redacted]. However, my interview with him was short. If later, he should come up with other details that he could not collaborate, this new information should be taken with a grain of salt. Mr. [redacted] tends to exaggerate things, especially when there's a story in it for him.

(c) Mr. [redacted] paid very little attention to it, because he thought it was just another satellite.

g. Weather and Winds - Aloft Conditions at Time and Place of Sightings

(1) Observer's account of the weather - clear, warm summer evening.

(2) Winds - S-SW 6mph, 6 Knots, 6,000'-269° -10 knots, 10,000'-318 knots, 16,000'-29° -25 knots, 20,000'-300° -31 knots, 25,000'-300° -54 knots, 30,000'-N/A, 50,000'-N/A, 80,000'-N/A.

(3) Ceiling - 8,000' scattered clouds.

(4) Visibility - 8 miles.

(5) Amount of cloud cover - scattered.

(6) No Thunderstorms in area.

(7) Vertical temperature gradient - surface-22° centigrade

- page 30 -

10,000½-2° centigrade.

h. According to the area astronomers there are no astronomical bodies that could account for such a path of flight. According to the weather people at Toronto, Buffalo and Niagara Falls, there was no meteorological activity that could account for the object.

i. No interception or identification action taken. The Cleveland and Syracuse radars reported nothing on their scopes in the general area of sighting.

j. The only balloon release during the day of sighting would have the balloon way to the south of Buffalo, not east of Niagara Falls.

k. Preparing Officers 2nd Lt. Frank X. Oberkoetter, Information Officer. Comments: I checked with the local astronomers in Buffalo and the Rochester Airports received notice of a strange object by any pilots. The Toronto weather bureau told me they had a similar report on the night before (17 June). Two men saw an object, bluish in color, moving in an unsteady path, out of the Big Dipper. That was all the information he could give me. I can offer no possible solution as to the nature or identity of the object sighted.

l. There are no existing physical pieces of evidence of any sort that I know of. None of the observers took pictures.
