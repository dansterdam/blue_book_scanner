DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20310
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

NOV 28 1968

Dear [illegible]:

This replies to your letter of November 16, 1968, in which you reported that you and your father have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force USAF base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

We are enclosing one additional copy of the sighting form to Patterson Air Force Base to complete it and send it to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. In the meantime, you might be able to identify the UFO's in the Project Blue Book after carefully reviewing what you saw.

Sincerely,

/s/
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

[Letterhead partially visible at top]

Washington, D.C. 20530

Gentlemen: Just what my father and I saw that night in the backyard on those strange goings-on when we both saw a red light first noticed in the sky, much faster than a jet. Soon after, the night was very dark and very clearly, as it was impressive that I could have been a part of it. A missile, or something of that nature. Off it was something that we of those, we would have first been able to see it, because it would be close the clouds. It was very high up, and looked about as big as a bright star. I saw no lights just as I mentioned. At have thought at once, trying very possibly as to what at night has been. I just can't identify it. Here are some facts you may need: TIME - 11:00 P.M. SKY - very cloudy. STARS - none visible. MOON - none. DESCRIPTION - very bright red, about as big as one sees a light. Bright for shape no object or shape just a light. Seems possible to be determined but much falls there in...

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS. SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The word "straight" is written on the larger sketch.
