DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Nov 25, 1968

Dear Sirs:

This replies to your letter of November 16, 1968, in which you and your father have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

According to your statement, you and your father observed a spherical object in the sky which you were unable to identify. However, as is indicated in the enclosed pamphlet on UFO's, many objects can be misinterpreted and the Air Force is often unable to provide a positive identification. Therefore, it is not possible for us to offer any further analysis.

Should you have any other information which you believe would be helpful to the Air Force in evaluating UFO's, please report it to the nearest Air Force base. Only by accumulating as many reports as possible can we hope to conduct a more accurate analysis.

We are indicating the possibility to the present Air Force Project BLUE BOOK investigation, which handles reports of unidentified flying objects. However, it is doubtful that any further investigation would result in a more satisfactory answer in this particular case.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AXTMAN
Major, USAF
