January 16, 1963

Dear Sirs:

Recently, there was a YOU ASKED FOR IT show and I saw it. I remembered a show & I told friends who were thinking about it, too, a story of Donald H. Kessell, a former teacher, about a saucer landing near his home in Portland, Oregon.

I was in an airplane on Aug. 12, 1962. It was about 10:00 when I saw it, at night. It lasted for about three seconds.

I saw it in SAN JOSE, California.

It appeared to have the shape of ducks in flight, moving a rigid formation. There were about eight or ten which appeared to be colorful, with the point of the lead object aiming south. It moved without a sound.

I was facing west.

It was (the weather) quite balmy, and there was not a visible cloud in the sky. There was a slightly breeze blowing.  

The moon was full.

An illustration of the saucer

The dots were colored gold.
The attitude was practically 90° (of the saucer).
The size was about the size of a pin.
The saucer moved on a straight plane with no, and then veered sharply at a 90° angle to disappear.
It traveled at amazing velocity. I would guess at about 500-600 mph.
There was nobody to confirm this report. I was so startled, I could not speak until a few minutes after it was gone.
The saucer was in the West, the Moon in the East.
It was moving against the wind.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
