Feb 26, 1964
4 Trenton Michigan.

Dear Sir, (s)

At 2105 and 30 seconds eastern standard time, I sighted a u.f.o. over
Trenton Michigan. It came out of the clouds at the position of 42 longitude and
97 latitude, racing from northwest to southeast at 4:30 it came out of the
clouds racing to south going to speed's way. It was hovering to fast to
be a star, later, a star, traveling fast is called a constant here told, the start
line a test. I tracked it and caught a glimpse of it through my telescope.
It looks like this."

I assure you it was more a star

this end
was a the land

or a satellite, because they were no registered satellite for the date a time...

Very Truly
Yours.

Trenton, Michigan
Dear Mr.

Additional information is essential for evaluation of your sighting, such as date of sighting, direction of flight and color of object. Would you please complete the enclosed form and return it to Hq Air Force, SAFOI-PB, in the envelope provided.

Thank you for reporting this unknown object to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Chief, Aerial Phenomena
Branch

The new fiscal year has just begun, and I hope that the newly formed Atmospheric Optics group can be given its own head of steam - some 10,000 work. In looking over the February, 1964 cases, I came across a number which would have been "just excellent" were it not for the one or two small technical defects. In one case from Trenton, Michigan, the conflicting data could have been quickly resolved, about the picture of the black and white object.

27. in the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

STRAIGHT ARC, STARTING AT A-B ON COMPASS ROSE (ABOVE) MOVED ACROSS SKY TO C-D (ABOVE) DECELERATED TO A STOP 30 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON, THEN ACCELERATED WENT OUT OF SIGHT AT SAME SPEED AS BEFORE, AT A-B

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? _____________
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
