Dear Sir: I had heard over Radio/TV/news in your paper that the Air Force had fired a Medoc satellite into orbit from Point Arguello, Calif. to span 350 million miles into space on Oct. 21. Now I see in the news paper that these rockets or satellites not they call them have not been tested by this time. Now I would like to write to you my experience. At I went after one night on Oct. 25 at about eleven thirty A.M. I saw a very peculiar sight. It was a big & fine moon the moon was out and we had a misty wind. There was before me in my line of view to west the sky was a glittering belt moving with a width of one & the air was full of glittering golden needles stretched it until it was out of sight.

toward the west. Isolated my sight to
the rest of my family as I got back to the
house. Now we can with hope see
the order that they have not found any
trace of their mother or child. So thought
it was our duty to report this incident to you
This is our location

We live about 6 miles north of Milwaukee after
on the New N.S. Highway 141

On 6 miles North of Sheboygan Wis. on N.S. Highway 141

Hoping this information is of value to you

Dear Mrs. [redacted]

It is highly unlikely that the "glittering self" that you reported could have been the WEST FORD dipoles. Scientists, using the most refined and powerful optical and electronic methods, have thus far failed to locate these hair-like metallic fibers.

However, I would like to thank you for your interest and sense of duty in reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
