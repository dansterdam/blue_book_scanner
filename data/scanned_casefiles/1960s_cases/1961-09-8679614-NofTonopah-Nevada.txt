If you would like to make an analysis of the sighting of a flying object in the late zone and with the same zone, using ATIC, this information will be of different help to get more details. It seems though that the object of sighting of 1 or 2 objects in the zone was short. I have a copy of the report of sighting through 7x56 period which was in the afternoon. The letter of sighting 22 June, finally stated that the first sighted object was considered as the point of sighting of the second one and was not identified. There was no additional information to be held of drawing a conclusion.

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

Sunday night, September 24, 1961 at 11:40 P.M., 1.39 miles south of the Pine Creek Ranch on State Highway 82, Monitor Valley, Nye County, Nevada, the following occurred:

At that time I stopped my vehicle and observed an intensely large, bright light hovering over a high mountain ridge in the Toquima Ranges, which was from me in a west southwest direction on the south slope of Andrews Canyon. I observed this unusual, large, light for eight minutes. At 11:48 P.M., the light focused down in a vertical position and then went out. I waited for at least five more minutes and then drove to the Wilson Ranch, a distance of about twenty-six and a half miles. From this ranch I placed a collect call at 12:55 A.M. to the Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, D. C. The operator would not accept the charges.

Rather than to continue disturbing the ranch people, I then drove to the Frontier Tavern, a business establishment located about twelve miles east of Austin, Nevada on Highway 50. There I placed a call at approximately 2:15 A.M. to Nellis Air Force Base, Las Vegas, Nevada. Again, the operator would not accept the charges. Finally, at about 2:25 A.M. I talked with the sheriff of Lander County and told him what I had observed.

In returning to the Wilson Ranch I crossed Pete's Summit in the northern part of the Toquima Range at about 2:45 A.M. Roughly a mile and a half from the summit, just as I emerged from the wooded area, I again observed another large object which glowed with an orange-yellowish color. It was traveling at very high velocity in a southerly direction which appeared to be fairly low over the east-lying Monitor Range. In about two or three minutes it turned in an easterly direction and traveled away.

Unidentified Flying Object
*******************

The weather in Monitor Valley Sunday night was as follows: the wind was calm, the sky absolutely clear and the moon full.

While observing the first-described object, I was able to discern smoke or fumes which appeared cloud-like just above the light. The light was white. When the beam focused in a downward vertical position, it is my estimate that the diameter of the beam was one-hundred feet or more. There was no sound of engines.

On September 27 I traversed the entire area where the object could have landed (a distance of about three miles from my observation position), but found no evidence of landing gears, imprints or waste matter of any kind. Inasmuch as this particular area was quite inaccessible, I found no evidence of any truck or vehicle tracks, nor any evidence that man or anyone had been there on the ground within some time.

Analysis and Conclusions: The first object was described as a large bright light moving above the mountains to the west of Tonopah. In the position reported, possibly a little lower. However, as it was just above the horizon it would appear to be at a higher altitude than it actually was. The second object, observed by the witness, has the characteristics of a very high altitude meteor, except for the excessive duration and its reappearance. A possible explanation for this object cannot be made at this time, therefore, it is categorized as unidentified until such time that more information is received that will aid in identifying it.

Gentlemen:

According to an article appearing in the Nevada state journal yesterday, you have a team of men who investigate every UFO or UAP report that you receive. I feel left out because no one ever checked with me.

On Sept. 24, 1961, I observed, on 2 occasions, such objects. I watched one hover for 15 minutes through 7x35 power binoculars at a distance of three miles.

On Sept. 29, 1961, I reported my observations to the CIA and Air Force Intelligence. The Air Force letter was sent to the Pentagon Bldg.—never heard from within of them.

I work as a geologist for the Bur. of Land Management, Dept. of the Interior.

Respectfully yours,

[Signature redacted]

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Mr. [redacted])

TO: Hq USAF SAF-01 3b (Mrs. Wells)
Wash 25 DC

1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. [redacted] requesting information on his UFO sighting of 24 September 1961. This letter is forwarded to you with background information to aid you in preparing a reply.

2. Mr. [redacted]'s report, forwarded to us by a personal letter of 29 September 1961, was evaluated and placed in the Air Force case file. The initial object sighted north of Tonopah, Nevada was evaluated as the planet Jupiter. The planet was in the position reported though possibly a little lower, being just over the horizon. The duration and maneuverability of the second object suggest a possible aircraft; however, this conclusion cannot be confirmed and the second object is carried as an unidentified.

3. Due to the completeness of the initial report submitted by Mr. [redacted], no field investigation was made.

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of August 12, 1963, to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been forwarded to this Headquarters for reply.

Your report of September 29, 1961, was evaluated and placed in the Air Force case file. The initial object sighted north of Tonopah, Nevada, was evaluated as possibly Jupiter. The planet was in the position reported though possibly a little lower, being just over the horizon. The duration and maneuverability of the second object suggest a possible aircraft; however, this conclusion cannot be confirmed and the second object is carried as unidentified.
