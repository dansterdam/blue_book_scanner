Office of Public Information
Washington 25, D.C.
September 25, 1962

Gentlemen:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter to
this office regarding a report of an unidentified flying
object (UFO) sighting in Oradell, New Jersey on September 1, 1962.

We are the Air Force compilations of UFO statistics and would you kindly send me the license fact sheets.

On September 1, 1962, a number of Oradell, New Jersey residents reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The Air Force investigated this sighting and concluded that the object was the planet Venus, which was very bright and prominent in the sky at that time. This explanation is consistent with the information you provided in your letter.

I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely yours,

MAJOR "FLY" IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY. An important "Fly" in Hillsdale, N. J., and 
surrounding area was reported at approx. 9:30 P.M. EST on 7 September 1962. The 
object was described as being approx. 25 ft. in diameter and moving at high speed 
in a Northwest direction at an altitude of approx. 1000 ft. 
Observers were: 
Mrs. Mary Ann Smith, 5 Springdale Road, Oradell Park, N. J.
Mr. Robert Stanley, 14 Grant Road, Oradell Park, N. J.,
Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Crane, 154 Highland Avenue, Oradell, N. J.
Mrs. Smith said that the object appeared to be surrounded by a red glow and made 
no sound as it passed overhead. She said it just about blotted out the stars as it 
went by. Mr. Stanley said that it appeared to be a solid, well defined object and 
did not blink or pulsate. Mr. Crane said that there was no trail or exhaust visible. 
The object was observed for approx. 10 to 12 seconds and then disappeared from view 
to the Northwest. No explanation or cause for this observation was determined.

OFFICIAL FILE COPY
TD8-1/Lt Col Friend/5928
UFO Sighting (Oradell, N.J., 13 Feb 62)
19 USAF SAPO-33 (Major Hart)
SAPO 28 FB
This reference to the attached copy of a
report of a UFO sighting received and forwarded from the 10th Aerospace
Defense Squadron is transmitted, both for information and to obtain suggestions
as to the scope and detail of information you may desire for the file.
The report is limited, both in scope and detail, for the following reasons:
1. The observer was a 10-year-old boy and the most logical causes for
the phenomenon described might conceivably be "out of this world."
2. The sighting was very brief and no physical evidence remains.
3. No instrument readings or other data to corroborate the sighting.
If the witness can provide further information, I will be glad to obtain it.
However, it is my opinion that this report, since it is based solely on the
recollection of a 10-year-old, has little significance, either as to the
identification of the object seen or as an addition to the data of UFO sightings.
The case is submitted for your information and any comments you care to make.

IT APPEARS TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE AIRCRAFT AND ABOUT 1/8 THE LENGTH OF THE PICTURE FROM THE RIGHT SIDE. THE OBJECT IS INDISTINCT AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SHARPLY DEFINED FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT IS TRULY A PHYSICAL OBJECT OR MERELY A PHOTOGRAPHIC IMPRESSION.

An 11:45-September 15th, 1962 SAUCER LAPPED IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY: An important SAUGER LAPPED over Oradell, New Jersey, (a town about 15 miles northwest of New York City) at 7:45 p.m. Saturday Sept. 15th, according to reports from eyewitnesses.

J.L.U., 72 years, reported that he had a clear view of the entire affair. He called for his wife to witness the object along with the next door neighbor's son.

They had seen it descending slowly, making a complete circle over the water, submerged for a few seconds, and then rose vertically over the water. It then re-appeared on the other side of the reservoir and shot across the reservoir in a horizontal position maintaining about the same altitude, and with no sound. To corroborate matters still further, large banana-shaped craft, estimated to be 200 feet long, several of them were sighted over the reservoir area, and the police then barricaded the land from the public.

The next day, Sunday Sept. 16th, the police again barricaded the area.

About 5 to 10
seconds later, another
object was observed,
like an "upside down
dish", very bright and
glistening. Upon
closer inspection, it
appeared to be two
objects joined. At this point, the parents of the witness
passed by local police and told that their sons should refrain
from reporting such unusual occurrences. A crowd assembled
as the object hovered over the Oradell Reservoir in hopes of
seeing the UFO return. Swerving slow movements were noted,
and the object seemed to move away from the observers. Other
people reported strange beams of light and fast-flying objects
in the area at that time.
Q UFO; something was seen, but the rumor was heard that Oradell police
officers had a similar experience days ago. The witnesses' observations

four observers spotted a UFO over the reservoir. A ground search
jet fighters approached the UFO and went under it as the jet

object which changed shape and maneuvered quickly, appearing
ing a large round white color.
On the next day, as it was fitting close to an exciting week,
two of the teenagers in Hackensack, N.J. claimed to have seen a
Pulaski pass. These people claims were substantiated by some youngsters
and their parents.
On Monday, Sept. 25th, the Record Co Hackensack news
seems a large round metallic object hovering over the Oradell Reservoir. As the object continued to maneuver, it was suddenly
approached by a small one-engine private plane, which was
ed to be a good reconnaissance for the general public, but no
explanation could account for all the sightings described above.

1. Reference the attached copy of the report of an unidentified flying object sighting which occurred on Oradell, New Jersey on 15 Sep 62.

2. The witnesses reported the object to be approximate 50 feet in diameter and disc-shaped. It did not make any noise and passed overhead at 500 feet. The object was surrounded by a glow and had a mist-like appearance around it. Details of the object when first observed but were dull when the object disappeared.

3. As is assumed that the object was a bird, approximate 3 feet in diameter, the largest bird known would be the Andean Condor with a wingspan of approximately 10 feet. This bird is considerably smaller than the reported 50 feet in diameter.

4. No lightning activity was reported to have taken place during the sighting and the contributing factor.

5. If the witnesses will re-evaluate the case in the light of the foregoing information, it would be appreciated.
