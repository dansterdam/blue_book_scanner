Gentlemen:

Please note that a number of recent letters to this office have gone unanswered. I would appreciate if you would reply to this letter.

Are the Air Force compilations of UFO statistics for 1962 ready for release yet? If so, would you kindly send me the latest Fact Sheet.

On September 15, 1962, several persons saw a UFO at the Oradell Reservoir. At one point the object struck the water then rose up out of sight. As this was probably the most outstanding case to take place during the flurry of sightings in northern New Jersey at that time, would you please inform of the Air Force conclusion for this report.

Sincerely yours,

SAUCER "FLAP" IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY: An important "flap" occurred in mid-September, in towns just a few miles from Fort Lee, Fort Lee, N. J. We are fortunate enough to have an accurate, if not unusual, summary of the entire affair. For this purpose, we quote a collected summary of the entire affair. The New Jersey Association on Aerial Phenomena, 15 Kendall Road, Kendall Park, N. J.

On Sunday, Sept. 15th, at 7:55 p.m., three boys told police that they had seen a strange oval-shaped craft set down in the Oradell Reservoir. Just shortly after dark, one boy called the object hovering over the water, immersed for a few seconds, and then rose vertically and disappeared. In further detail, a spokesman at the reservoir appeared. In just about the time the boys said the object hovered, a local hearing a loud splash at just about the time, large banana-shaped cracks hit the water. To complicate matters, where several witnesses claimed the UFO had landed first, the Air Force sent a paramedic and the police more than heard first. The next day, Sunday Sept. 16th, two Emerson youths reported seeing...

UFO Sighting (Oradell, N.J., 15 Sep 62)

To USAF SAFOI-36 (Major Hart)
Wash 35 DC

1. Reference the attached copy of the report of an unidentified flying object sighting which occurred in Oradell, New Jersey on 15 September 1962. The information contained in this report is limited, both in scope and detail, precluding a positive finding as to what caused the sighting. However, the available information points toward the misidentification of a bird as the most logical cause.

2. The witnesses reported the object to be approximately the size of a Paper Cub at a distance of three-quarters of a mile. If this is true the angular subtended by the object, assuming the longest dimension of the Cub, would be approximately 0.5 degrees, the same angle subtended the moon. However, it the object passed over 500 feet as reported, it would subtend an angle of approximately 4.5 degrees or would appear and times larger than the moon. The witnesses reported limited details of the object when first observed but were unable to observe any additional detail when the object was larger by a factor of nine.

3. If we assume that the object was a bird, approximately 150 feet away from the witnesses and closer than 100 feet when passing over them, the bird would then approximate the angular sizes derived from the information provided by the witnesses.

4. This sighting took place during the middle twilight hours and the shadowy effects common to this time of day were probably a contributing factor.

5. If the witnesses can provide further information regarding the sighting, we will re-evaluate the case in the light of this new evidence.

[Several paragraphs of text, with some words difficult to read due to image quality. The text appears to be a report about a UFO sighting, with mentions of police, witnesses, and incidents on different dates in September]

On Thursday, Sept. 20th, the series of incidents was prolonged by four Emerson boys and two local men who saw a UFO near Casanova. As the UFO approached the UFO and went under it. As the men attempted to make close passes, the UFO seemed to maneuver, like many others, had the appearance of burning magnesium, known for its bright light.

The next day, as a fitting close to an exciting week, two large white objects were seen. The first was observed at Pulaski Park in Hackensack, where some persons, while hundreds of people were at Great Mountain in East Patterson played host to a similar incident.

On Monday, Sept. 25th, the Record (a local newspaper) concluded a large front page story with a headline "Flying Saucer Tracked in Sky a Great Ride up of a Helium Balloon with a Bald Wood Grove, small group of men claimed." The article went on to be a good enough explanation for the general public, but in the view of this writer, there was considerable doubt.

SAUCER "FLAP" IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY: An important "Flap" occurred in mid-September, in towns just a few miles from Fort Lee Head-quarters. We ourselves saw nothing, but we are fortunate enough to have an ex-cellent summary of the entire affair. For this summary our thanks go to Edward J. Ruppock, Jr., who is director of the New Jersey Association on Aerial Phenomena, 15 Tyndale Road, Kendall Park, N. J.

On Saturday Sept. 15th, at 7:55 p.m., three boys told police that they had seen a strange oval-shaped craft set down in the Oradell Reservoir, just south of the Oradell Dam. The three said the object hovered over the water, submerged for a few seconds, and then rose vertically and disappeared. As further proof, a fisherman on the opposite side of the reservoir reported hearing a loud splash at just about the time the boys said the object hit the water. To corroborate matters still further, large banana-shaped tracks were reported in Emerson (a nearby town), where several witnesses claimed the UFO had landed first. The Air Force sent a representative to the area and the police then barricaded the land from the public.

The next day, Sunday Sept. 16th, two Emerson youths reported see-

For five days, the East experienccd many sightings, with, as on Sept 16 here, new state patrolman policeman were witness. Unconfirmed observation of U F O s were reported. On UFO struck the surface of a reservoir with a splash, and then hovered above the surface. Eighteen foot of colored movie film was taken of a UFO or UFOs. No motion noted of objects. NICAP has requested copies of our type, pending painting. (This information given to G-m Conklin, Harry Leyers by Richard Hall of NICAP.

Two Army sites near 630 Leh. Two boys found UFOs were sighted by Bowman Navy flying Officer and Walkers. At 7:50 pm a NUIC member saw a clouding object descend toward Randall, and other witness saw it dart back and forth near the reservoir. At 7:55 p.m. three teenagers boys saw a bright oval-shaped object land in the reservoir, with a loud splash....after moment the strange device took off, climbed steeply at high speed. This series of sightings has many more particulars which can be repeated here. This series of sightings proceeded the sighting in Oradell. (See at 5700 a.m., Sept. 16, 1962 (Oct. ATIC file)

louder.
Upon talking
to one of the
boys, it was
learned that
the object
appeared to
be domed, and
had two sort
holes along its perimeter. At this point, the parents of the witnesses were phoned by local police and told that their sons should refrain from speaking about the matter, since the Government had requested a secrecy policy.

Two days later, on Tuesday, Sept. 18th, over one hundred people flocked to the Oradell Reservoir in hopes of seeing the UFO return. (See photo above.) They saw nothing, but on the same night, two policemen from nearby Westwood, N. J. reported seeing a fast-moving object shaped like an inverted cone. Other people reported strange beams of light and fast-flying red discs.

The following night, heavy rain dampened the spirits of many yet, twenty people still turned out at the reservoir hoping to catch a glimpse of a UFO. Nothing was seen, but the rumor was heard that Oradell police had shot a 14-total-call man with shotguns. In neighboring communities that night, nine witnesses, including patrolmen, sighted strange aerial objects, including one which was seen to land.

On Thursday, Sept. 20th, the series of incidents was prolonged by four Emerson boys who spotted a UFO near the reservoir. A formation of three jet fighters approached the UFO and went under it. As the jets attempted to make another pass, the saucer silently rose and disappeared. This saucer, like many others, had the appearance of burning magnesium, known for its bright white color.

The next day, as a fitting close to an exciting week, two formations of six large bright white objects were seen. The first was observed at Polish Park in Hackensack by some young parents and their parents, while two hundred people atop Garret Mountain in East Patterson played host to a similarly awesome display.

On Monday, Sept. 24th, the Record (a Hackensack newspaper) received a letter from a group of Bergenfield boys who claimed that they constructed and flew a craft made up of a hollow balloon with a balsa wood frame, controlled by radio waves received by a small one-horsepower motor. This seemed to be a good enough explanation for the general public, but in the minds of the witnesses, there was considerable doubt. It seems impossible that this explanation could account for all the sightings described above.

USAF QUIZZER

1. Description of object.
Shape. Round with a fin on the top. Size. About 20 ft. in diameter. Color. White.

Since there is no clear object conducted got in review, further details are rather
vague. All are observer's own words.

Color. No color distinction. Slightly bright. Seemed to be a few groups of
objects. Light seemed to change from white to dull the color of rust.

Markings. One

Distinctive features. The window described above are the clues.

No tail, trail or exhaust.
No sound, only which when object fell into position.

2. Description of the course of the object.
Object was moving north to south along the Oradell Reservoir.
When first observed it was at treetop level. The object hovered over a
tree, such hovered and then tilted and dropped into the reservoir. It
took off again proceeding south. It was thought that the object was
not vertical.

Time first observed the object was 20:30 hours.
When the object disappeared (last observed) it was a hurtling due south.

Time period of observation was unknown.

3. Manner of observation.
The persons observing the object were on a bridge, sighted and saw it, over the
reservoir. The bridge is located at 19 ft. north of the Oradell Reservoir. Located
in the middle of the bridge. The persons were standing.

The object was observed with the naked eye.

Complainant's name below                            Address
Time reported 7:55 Date 9/13/62                     How received Form

Received by Walla, B.O. Investigator by Walla, B.O. Investigator

Detailed at 7:55 PM 9/13/62 three boys (listed below) came into the station. They reported seeing a flying object over the reservoir in the area of the dam. This object was round, other than the object 15 seconds disappeared from the object same down and struck the water. In terms 15 landed in the water. North of the dam, in the river. The flying object left the area at a high rate of speed.

The boys, John Bowers, Thomas Yannuzzi, and James Corey, all of Oradell, N.J., Bridge, were standing near the dam when they sighted the object. Immediately was formed.

Remarks: P.D. Lockwood T.P.O., Hackensack Water Co., notified. They contacted their lawyer, making a record.

Called telephone directory, Navy reports no missing aircraft. However, they will call the Army. They will have the Air Defense Command Air Force Base called, spoke to Operational Officer, he took down report. Called Continental Flying Object Reporting Center, Capt. J.A. Haines, A.F.D.S., took a full report. Called Maj. Gill, Ft. Monmouth, A.F.D.S., took a very brief interest in case, etc.

Subsequent investigation, boys were questioned. They persisted in their story. They were standing on the bridge between them and the area is with the object, reported.

Preliminary, possibly from the back or bottom. It made no sound. The only noise, reported was a loud splash when the object, Lockwood P.D. reports they spoke to men working on their side of the reservoir and all stated they heard a loud splash. A full sheet of the water around the edge of reservoir revealed no additional information.

Walla has three sketches made by boys of object.

Conclusion: Insufficient data to make a definite determination. They appeared to be very sincere. One boy became very frightened. Even later they still maintained their story.

Signatures at bottom of document by Walla and another investigator.
