The image contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches depicting a phenomenon observed in the sky. The first sketch shows a person at the center of the compass rose, indicating the direction of the phenomenon. The second and third sketches show a person in the foreground with a landscape in the background, suggesting the observed phenomenon in the sky.

The OCR text from the document is as follows:

GA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A '?' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '?' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, CURVED OR ERRATIC. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

There is a photograph present in this image, which appears to be a hand-drawn diagram or chart. The diagram depicts a curved line with markings and labels, including "OBSERVER" and "H:H:S". This seems to be related to the "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" form shown in the image.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
It was a dark night, at 8:15 pm, my attention was drawn to
the object when I was standing in the garden waiting for a friend to pick me up in her car. Clouds obscure the moon somewhat, but I saw a bright circular object approach, which at first I thought was a plane. However, its speed and the way it moved drew my attention. It moved across the sky at a rapid rate, made an approximate 90 degree turn, and then moved to disappear behind some hills in the distance. The observation time was approximately 2 to 3 minutes, with the object clearly visible for an estimated 2 continuous seconds at a time, with approximately 2 second intervals.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It disappeared behind hills known at St. Louis Heights.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Yes, the object moved behind hills.

The image contains a photograph showing a series of luminous shapes or objects that appear to be changing color from white to red. The text below the image describes the phenomenon as "Moved down changing color from white to red".

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WITNESS OR PHOTOGRAPHIC INDICATIONS, AND INDICATE CLEARLY WHAT CAUSED THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

Moved down changing color from white to red.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A TREE OR A HOUSE. COMPARE THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON TO THE MATCH HEAD. THIS WILL INDICATE THE APPROXIMATION OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON.

It seemed to be an extraordinarily bright light. I saw a pinkish glow surrounding the object, wich appeared to be much larger than a star. It was a round, self-luminous object which seemed to move inland toward the mountains and seemed finally to be hidden by the hills. It was a big rockiet flare, moving constantly downward in a very straight line.
