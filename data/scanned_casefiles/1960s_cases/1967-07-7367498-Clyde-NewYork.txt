The observer's name was listed in another report as a witness to a sighting of 20 August 67. The observer replied that he had not seen any UFO's on 20 August 67, but that he had seen some on 13 July and two on 28 Aug. He gives all three reports on one form 117. The results are somewhat difficult to understand and is in general, confusing. Also the report was nearly 3 months old when submitted and because of the time involved it would be very difficult to investigate properly.

The Sighting on July 13. Showed up as most one bright Red light after watching it. I first saw a somewhat bright object in the darker area the weather, all a smaller light appeared in the back of the larger one. Dimmed Down and disappeared. This time the large light Dimmed out a third appeared on the while the smaller ones came out. After Dimming Then the first one to appear went away after Dimands. Then the fourth one appeared. This went on for about 6 times. only to be in sight for 10 seconds.

on July 28. at 00:10 I spotted a bunch of Red Light that at first made me think that a plane was on fire. I went home and got my Binoculars, but by that time west 1Â½ miles away nothing in the sky. This was about appeared again at 00:10 same date. this object appeared again following at 31 Thur. The Village. I was about 1000 - 1500 ft away from at 31 when I spotted this.

there was a sheriff's easy traveling about 30-35 mph thru the village with this object 50 ft north of it and I'd say 5th sec. He about it.

Before I could pick up the towaway radio and have them check what was then the lights all went out and the didn't reappear again. This object was keeping the same speed as the sheriff's car and the light stayed on. There Blue on the bottom three Red on top with it. About 25 ft apart.

This looked like (61) six object as there was no sighting or outline.
