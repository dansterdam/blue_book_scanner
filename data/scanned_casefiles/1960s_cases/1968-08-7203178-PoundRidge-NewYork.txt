11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer stated that he sighted a metallic disc-shaped object that traveled in a zig-zag direction and crossed about 50 degrees of the sky in approximately 8 seconds.
COMMENTS: Indicates to the police departments of several cities and towns along what was indicated as the probable flight path of the object. No confirmatory reports were received. 11 Aug 68 to the volunteer flight officers network and no one reported anything unusual for the date and time in question. HOWEVER, surface weather observations indicated that there was an overcast sky in the area only an hour before. THERE WAS AN OVERCAST SKY IN THE AREA ONLY AN HOUR BEFORE. Surface winds for the area were southeasterly at 5-11 knots and such a small object could have been but a piece of debris in the wind.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

POUND RIDGE, NEW YORK
August 11, 1958

At about 4:10 p.m., EDT, observer stated he had sighted a metallic disc-shaped object travelling in a SSW direction. It crossed about 50° of arc in approximately 5-6 seconds.

Inquiries were made to police departments of several cities and towns along the route where the object was reported. No one reported any unusual objects to these police departments. No one else in the area reported seeing any such object. There were no reports, and no meteors were reported to the American Meteor Society.

The observer said that visibility on that day was unlimited, however, visibility in the area only an hour before the sighting was very poor due to smog. The observation was an overcast sky in the area where the sighting occurred.

CONCLUSIONS: This report was carried for a time as UNIDENTIFIED, but on further study, the activity was determined, by accounts given, to bear the characteristics of a natural phenomenon. As such, the case is now being carried as a POSSIBLE NATURAL PHENOMENON in this wind.

Dear Mr. Quinlan:

Very many thanks for the large batch of reports which you collected and sent to me. As I hastily scanned them over, I was amazed at the amount of work involved in your investigations and estimations. In them I find much that is observed and recorded in fine detail, and from which I believe much information could be gathered.

I wish I could reciprocate by giving you reports on the physical cases you have observed, but the UFO's themselves do not seem to have much effect that I can measure. As most of you will know, this is one of the difficulties we have here of "observing the UFO's." As most of you will know, this is one of the difficulties we have here of "observing the UFO's", a difficulty that has persisted throughout.

I am enclosing the 5 reports you requested from the 1968 files which I hope will be of interest. Let me know if you can use anything else from the Uranographic or 400.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

August 15, 1965
Cedar Hill Lane
Pound Ridge, N.Y. 10576

United States Air Force
Dept. of Investigations, Flying Object
Washington, D.C.

Att: Major Donald Keyhoe

Washington, D.C.

William J. Feyorian, Pound Ridge, N.Y., reported seeing a saucer-shaped object, approximately 20-25 feet in diameter, which passed overhead at a normal speed and appeared to be at an altitude of 500-600 feet. The object had a brillant glow, was very steady in its course, and appeared to be 15-20 feet in thickness from the bottom view. 

On Sunday, August 15, 1965 at approximately 4:10 p.m. I was in my home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. 3 year old daughter was playing outside, when she came in and said, "Daddy, look at the thing in the sky." I immediately went outside and observed the object for approximately 3 minutes. It was traveling in a westerly direction at a normal speed and an altitude of 500-600 feet. The saucer-shaped object had a brilliant glow and was very steady in its course. It appeared to be 15-20 feet thick from the bottom view. There was no sound associated with the object. Gradually the object moved out of sight and disappeared over the horizon. From the point of first sighting to its disappearance it was approximately 3 to 4 miles. I was unable to distinguish any windows, ports or markings on the object. This flying object crossed the entire countryside in a straight and level course and disappeared over the horizon to the west. I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this report. Thank you.

- page 20 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

OCR text output:

The object was rounded, bright and mobile looking similar to polished aluminum. Judging by the light pattern on the bottom, "it the object seemed to be hovering, the receding of curvature of the bottom was gradual, then the receding of the sides of the object. Therefore, it was not apparent in shape.

The path of flight seemed at a constant velocity and at tremendous speed as far as could be determine which kept it on a straight course.

It can be assumed of the fact that we had a meteor observation in the same area. This object seemed to the observer perfectly round and a very thermodynamic surface, both in motion and conduct.

If it can be of any further help, please feel free to contact me.

Dear Miss Turner, 

This will reply to your letter of August 13, 1968, in which you requested information concerning an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting and your daughter's report.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire, we shall be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base in the United States. This type of on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFOs in the material we are including.
