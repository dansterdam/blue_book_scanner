(SIGHTING RE-EVALUATED, SEE ATTACHED OLD CARD)

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer stated that he sighted a metallic disc-shaped object that traveled in a SSE direction and crossed about 50 deg of arc in approximately 8 seconds.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
8 Seconds

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
Ground-Visual

COMMENTS: Inquires were made to the police departments of several cities and towns along what was indicated as the probable flight path of the object. No one reported anything unusual for FKA 11 Aug 68 to the volunteer flight officers network and no meteors were reported to the American Meteor Society for the afternoon of 11 Aug. The observer stated that "visibility on that day was unlimited", however, surface weather observations indicated there was an overcast sky in the area only an hour before. The surface winds were southeasterly to southerly at 5-11 knots, and as such, a small object being blown in the wind may account for the sighting.

POUND RIDGE, NEW YORK
August 11, 1968

At about 4:10 p.m., EDT, observer stated he had sighted a metallic disc-shaped object travelling in a SSE direction. It crossed about 500 of arc in approximately eight seconds.

Inquiries were made to police departments of several cities and towns along the indicated probable flight path. No one reported any unusual objects to these police departments, nor was Newark, and no meteors were reported to the American Meteor Society the afternoon of August 11.

The observer said that visibility on that day was unlimited, however, surface weather observations indicated that there was an overcast sky in the area only an hour before the sighting. Surface winds for the area were southeasterly at five to eleven knots.

CONCLUSIONS: This report was carried for a time as UNIDENTIFIED, but on further study, the southeasterly wind at five to eleven knots, was determined, may account for a small object being blown in the wind. As such, the case is now being carried as POSSIBLE DEBRIS IN THE WIND.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Very many thanks for the large batch of reports on the July 2 fireball which you collected and sent to me. I have hurriedly read them over. As you well know most observers have the vague ideas as to what we need, i.e. altitudes and azimuths, etc. which forms some reports less useful. But with this addition to what I already have, I plan to see if the heights etc. can be resolved. Your help in the matter, as always, is most valuable.

I wish I could reciprocate by giving you reports on the several cases you asked about, namely the one over Vera Cruz and the UFO over Hoboken. I have no more than 2 or 3 written reports. It seems to me that the Navy should have had some vessel not too far from the Vera Cruz area; perhaps you can get something out of them. Since they stopped printing their annual report in their bulletin, the number of reports they send me has drastically decreased. I do not think mariners now thank reporting worthwhile, which is a consequence of the Navy's general 1967 to early 1965 annual report from the Hydrographic Office.

Five reports from _______ dealing with reports from air plots have come on what he labels " # 3273 1968-448 Cosmos 222 Rocket Body". Do you think it would be worth my time and effort to your office? I computed 14 atmospheric path data at hand. It came Aug. 13 1968 at 0830 Z.

Sincerely yours,

We have been unable to identify the stimulus for your 11 August 1968 unidentified flying objects sighting. Inquiries were made to the police departments of several cities and towns along what you indicated was the probable flight path of the object. No one reported anything unusual to these police departments. No pilots reported seeing anything unusual for the 11th to the Volunteer Flight Officer's Network, and no meteors were reported to the American Meteor Society for the afternoon of the 11th. Therefore your sighting is being carried as unidentified in our files.

United State Air Force
Dept. of Unidentified Flying Object
Washington, D.C.
Attn: Major Donald Keyhoe

Major Keyhoe:

Please forgive any errors in name, address or department. The subject of this letter is a UFO sighted by my daughter and myself on Sunday, Aug. 11.

On Sunday August 11, 1968 at approximately 4:10 PM. at my home in Pound Ridge, my 3 year old daughter was lying on the ground, on her back at my feet. Suddenly she pointed straight up and yelled "Look!" From this point, straight up, I could see about 50° of open sky in the direction of flight SSE. This flying object crossed the open sky in complete silence, without any vapor trail or exhaust trail, and in less than 8 seconds. Visibility on that day was unlimited. The altitude would be difficult to guess not knowing the actual size of the object, but as it crossed one sky, we were struck that of a vehicle. I would estimate to speed at 8 times the speed of the fastest jet alive. (F106)


- page 20 -

Here is the text from the document:

the object was round, bright and metallic looking similar to polished aluminum. Judging by the light pattern on the bottom of the object caused by the sun, the radius of curvature of the bottom was greater than the radius of the diameter of the object, therefore it was not spherical in shape.

The path of flight seemed at a constant altitude and in a relatively straight line to the S.E. However, it noticed at least three way slight corrections which kept it on a generally straight path.

I am aware of the fact that we had a meteor shower on the same day. This object seemed to be more stable, perfectly round and a very homogeneous surface both in material and contour.

If at ease of any further help please feel free to contact me.

Yours truly,
[Signature area is blacked out]

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter of August 18, 1960, in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) by you and your daughter.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
