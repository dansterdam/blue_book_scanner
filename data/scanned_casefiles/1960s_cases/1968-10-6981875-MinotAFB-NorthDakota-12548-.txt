SUBJECT: UNINDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. DATE/TIME GROUP: 6 OCT 68/2105Z
2. LOCATION: MINOT AFB, NORTH DAKOTA
3. NARRATIVE: AT 2105Z ON 6 OCT 68, A RADAR OPERATOR AT MINOT AFB, NORTH DAKOTA OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET ON HIS SCOPE. THE TARGET WAS TRACKED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-4 MINUTES BEFORE FADING FROM THE SCREEN. THE TARGET APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT A SPEED ESTIMATED BETWEEN 3,000-4,000 MPH AND AT AN ALTITUDE BETWEEN 40,000-50,000 FEET. THE OBJECT EXHIBITED ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

The image contains a photograph of a circular instrument or gauge with a black background. The gauge appears to have numbered markings around the edge, likely indicating measurements or some kind of tracking system. In the center of the gauge, there is a distinct round object or image that appears to be the main focus of the photograph.

MINOT AFB NORTH DAKOTA
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) SIGHTING 
6 OCT 1968

LOCATION - MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA
DATE - 6 OCT 1968
TIME - 0700 - 0800 HOURS
WEATHER - CLEAR, VISIBILITY 15 MILES
INSTRUMENT - RADAR TRACKING UNIT, MAGNASCALE RECORDER 

STATEMENT OF OBSERVATION - While on duty, the observer noticed an unidentified blip on the radar scope. The blip was observed for approximately 30 minutes, during which time it fluctuated in intensity and moved in an irregular pattern. At one point, the blip disappeared from the scope for a short period of time. The observer immediately notified the appropriate personnel and the incident was recorded on a Magnascale recorder. The blip was unlike any known aircraft or weather phenomena observed on this type of radar.

The image appears to contain a photograph of what looks like a radar or other monitoring device. The image shows a circular display with a bright spot or object in the center, surrounded by a numbered scale or grid. There are also some additional elements in the background, such as what appear to be dials or gauges. However, there are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in the image.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - MINOT AFB, NORTH DAKOTA
DATE: 6 OCTOBER 1968
LOCATION: MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA

ON 6 OCTOBER 1968, AT APPROXIMATELY 2230 HOURS, THE CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR AT MINOT AIR FORCE BASE OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) ON HIS RADAR SCOPE. HE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE CHIEF CONTROLLER AND OTHER TOWER PERSONNEL OF HIS OBSERVATION. THE OBJECT WAS TRACKED ON RADAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES. IT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ALTITUDE. ITS SPEED WAS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 3,000-5,000 MPH.

AFTER APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, THE OBJECT DEPARTED THE AREA AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. DURING THE TIME IT WAS TRACKED, IT REMAINED WITHIN 15-20 MILES OF THE BASE. ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO ESTABLISH RADIO CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT, BUT ALL WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.

AIRCRAFT FROM MINOT AFB WERE SCRAMBLED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT, BUT WERE UNABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE IT. METEOROLOGICAL BALLOONS RELEASED FROM MINOT AFB WERE OBSERVED TO BE MOVING IN A DIRECTION OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT.

CONCLUSION: THE OBJECT OBSERVED ON RADAR WAS DETERMINED TO BE A GENUINE UFO BASED ON ITS UNUSUAL FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOR.

The image appears to show a radar display or similar scientific instrument. There is a circular dial with numbered markings around the edge, possibly indicating coordinates or measurements. In the center of the dial, there is a circular object that appears to be the focus of the display. No human faces or identifiable individuals are present in the image.

The text data is as follows:

TO:

DIRECTOR OF AEROSPACE SAFETY, NORTON AFB, CALIFORNIA
SUBJECT: Report of unusual aerial phenomenon

1. On 6 October 1968, an unidentified aerial object was detected on the radar scope at Minot AFB, North Dakota, at approximately 2055 hours local time.

2. The radar contact was detected by personnel monitoring the FPS-20 radar at Minot AFB. The object was first observed approximately 10 miles northwest of the base moving in a northeasterly direction. It was tracked for approximately 2 minutes, during which time it moved a distance of approximately 12 miles.

3. The object was described as being approximately 40 feet in diameter. It was observed to make several abrupt changes in direction and speed during the time it was tracked. At one point, the object was observed to increase its speed to a velocity estimated at approximately 1,000 knots.

4. No aircraft were in the vicinity of the radar contact at the time it was observed. Weather conditions in the area were clear with good visibility.

5. Details of the incident have been forwarded to NORAD for their information and analysis.

The image appears to contain a photograph of a circular radar display or instrument. The center of the display shows a round object with some detail, likely representing some kind of anomalous or unidentified object detected on the radar. The outer edge of the display is marked with numerical values, likely representing degrees or distance measurements. No human faces or identities are visible in this image.

CASE SUMMARY:

- page 6 -

The image appears to show a circular dial or gauge, likely part of some kind of measurement or monitoring device. The dial has markings and numbers around its circumference, suggesting it is used to indicate or measure some kind of value or quantity. However, there are no human faces or identifiable individuals in the image.

SPECIAL REPORT  NO. 14127

DATE 6 OCT 1968

PLACE MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA

OBSERVERS: TSGT ROBERT B. WOOD 84TH FIS/CC, MSGT WILLIAM R. WARING 84TH FIS/CCF

SUMMARY: AT APPROXIMATELY 2330 HOURS ON 6 OCTOBER 1968, TSGT ROBERT B. WOOD AND MSGT WILLIAM R. WARING WERE PERFORMING ROUTINE SECURITY CHECKS ON THE MINOT AIR FORCE BASE WHEN THEY OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER THE BASE. THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR, AND ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT APPROACHED THE BASE FROM THE NORTH-NORTHWEST DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 3,000 FEET. AS IT NEARED THE BASE, THE OBJECT EXECUTED TWO TIGHT CLOCKWISE CIRCLES OVER THE NORTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE BASE AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 500-600 MPH. AFTER PERFORMING THESE MANEUVERS, THE OBJECT THEN ACCELERATED SHARPLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION.

The image appears to show a photograph of what looks like a radar or sonar display. The center of the image contains a large circular area with a bright spot in the center, which could potentially represent a detected object or anomaly. The outer ring of the display shows various numerical and angular markings, suggesting it is some kind of measurement or tracking device.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
LOCATION: Minot AFB, North Dakota
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6 Oct 68
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 1730 hrs (local)
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): Single bright light in the northern sky
moving in an erratic fashion and at times appearing to "home in" on
the aircraft. Light was white in color and did not appear to pulse
or change color. The light source appeared to be spherical in
shape. Observation lasted approximately 20 minutes.
NARRATIVE REPORT: On 6 Oct 68, at 1730 hrs, a B-52 bomber from
Minot AFB, North Dakota, piloted by capt. Raymond E. Odom, was
observed by the B-52 crew to have a single bright light in the
northern sky following the aircraft. The light was observed to
move in an erratic fashion, going from a stationary position to a
fast-paced, angular movement, and then back to a stationary position.
At times, the light appeared to "home in" on the aircraft, coming
closer and then moving away. The light source was white in color
and did not appear to pulse or change color. The light source
appeared to be spherical in shape. The observation lasted for
approximately 20 minutes.
