AGO (150)
CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, JULY 15 (AP)-- A MYSTERIOUS GLOWING OBJECT--
HOVERING NEAR CANBERRA AIRPORT WHILE THE U.S. MARINER SPACE PROBE
WAS TAKING PICTURES OF MARS -- HAS BAFFLED EXPERTS IN CANBERRA.
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND OTHER EXPERT AIRCRAFT OBSERVERS SAID
THEY SPOTTED THE OBJECT TODAY.
SIX MEMBERS OF TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER CREW SAID IT HUNG
SUSPENDED AT ABOUT 5,000 FEET FOR 40 MINUTES. WHEN THE SUN GLINTED
OFF IT, IT BECAME CLEARLY VISIBLE, THEY SAID. IT DISAPPEARED WHEN
AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS SENT OUT TO IDENTIFY IT.
EXPERTS ARE NOW WONDERING IF IT WAS COINCIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT
WAS SIGHTED SHORTLY BEFORE NEARBY FINNBINLA TRACKING STATION WAS
SCHEDULED TO PICK UP MARINER SIGNALS. THE STATION HAD UNUSUAL
DIFFICULTY IN LOCKING ON TO MARINER AT THE TIME.
THE SIGHTING ALSO CAME AS GOLDSTONE TRACKING STATION RECEIVED
IRREGULARITIES IN MESSAGES WHILE MARINER WAS PHOTOGRAPHING MARS.

CANBERRA-FIRST ADDED OBJECT (AGO) T T X MASS,
THIS WAS THE FIFTH REPORTED SIGHTING OF A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT
RECENTLY.

SEVERAL PERSONS IN WARMINSTER, ENGLAND, SAID LAST WEDNESDAY
THEY SAW A FIERY OBJECT GLOWING IN THE SOUTHERN SKY. IN VALSOLE,
FRANCE, A FARMER SAID A FOOTBALL SHAPED OBJECT TOOK OFF FROM
HIS FIELD.

LAST THURSDAY THE CHILEAN AIR FORCE AND THE ARGENTINE NAVY
REPORTED THAT CHILEAN, BRITISH AND ARGENTINE PERSONNEL IN THE
ANTARCTIC SAW A GLOWING OBJECT 21P ACROSS THE SKY JULY 3.
ARGENTINA SAID THE OBJECT INTERFERED WITH INSTRUMENTS MEASURING
MAGNETIC FIELDS.

SEVERAL PERSONS SAW WHAT THEY SAID WAS A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT
FLYING OVER THE AZORES AND PORTUGAL LAST SATURDAY. PORTUGUESE
AERONAUTICAL EXPERTS SAID IT APPEARED TO BE A LONG BALLOON MADE
OF TRANSPARENT PLASTIC.

Canberra, Australia

UAO Over Canberra Airport

On the 15th of this press wires carried the details of the sighting of a mysterious glowing object which hovered near Canberra airport while the U. S. Marine space probe was taking pictures of Mars.

The initial story said that the object "was baffled experts in Canberra." The object was spotted by air traffic control officers and other expert aircraft observers on the 15th, at 10:50 a. m.

Six members of the traffic control tower told the press that the object "hung suspended" at about 5,000 feet for 40 minutes and that when the sun glinted on it, it became perfectly visible. It disappeared when an Air Force plane was sent out to identify it.

In the initial press story, experts were quoted as "wondering if it was coincidence" that the object was sighted shortly before nearby Tidimbilla tracking station was scheduled to pick up Marine signals. The station, the report said, had unusual difficulty in locking on at the time.

FLYING SAUCERS
BY JERRY BUCK
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
NEW YORK, JULY 20 (AP)--SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE
SEEING MORE IN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE WING.

FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING
OBJECTS ZIPPING THROUGH SPACE AND, IN SOME REPORTED CASES, INTERFERING
WITH ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT.

AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST
TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNEXPLAINED.

BUT A GLOWING OBJECT THAT CAUSED A COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO
MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.

WHAT ARE THESE OBJECTS?
TO DATE, THE AIR FORCE HAS LOOKED INTO 9,127 REPORTED SIGHTINGS
SINCE 1947, SAYS THEY USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS, SEARCHLIGHTS,
JET EXHAUSTS--OR THE RED AND WHITE KITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
CHILD.

TO DATE, THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, AND
MOST OF THESE, IT SAID, COULD BE EXPLAINED AWAY IF MORE INFORMATION
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATING AGENCY, PROJECT
BLUEBOOK AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, DAYTON, OHIO.

THE AIR FORCE SAID 18 YEARS OF INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE.

DISAGREEING WITH THE AIR FORCE IS MAJ. DONALD E. KEYHOE,
RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS
COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

BA52
"THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND
SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME
ADVANCED CIVILIZATION," SAID KEYHOE.

KEYHOE CONTENDS THE AIR FORCE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION YEARS
AGO, BUT HAS A "HIGH LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS NOT TO SCARE PEOPLE."

THE SAUCER SEASON GOT OFF TO A FLYING START IN EUROPE JULY 7.
"IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA HORLOCK, WHO, WITH
HER HUSBAND HAROLD, SPOTTED A FIERY OBJECT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR
WARMINSTER, ENGLAND.

THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW
TAKING OFF FROM HIS FARM AN OBJECT THAT RESEMBLED A LARGE FOOTBALL
WITH FOUR METAL LEGS. "WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," SAID AN OFFICIAL.

THE NEXT DAY THE CHILEAN AIR FORCE AND ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED
THAT CHILEAN, ARGENTINE AND BRITISH PERSONNEL IN ANTARCTICA SAW A
LENS-SHAPED OBJECT---YELLOWISH RED, CHANGING TO GREEN, YELLOW AND
ORANGE---THAT AFFECTED INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE MAGNETIC FIELDS.

OVER PORTUGAL AND THE AZORES JULY 10 MORE FLYING THINGS WERE
SEEN. THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING
OBJECT APPEARED OVER THE ISLAND AND THAT THE BUREAU'S ELECTROMAGNETIC
CLOCK STOPPED.

AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND
OTHER EXPERT AIRCRAFT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT
CLIPPING IN THE SUN NEAR THE AIRPORT AT CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA. IT WAS
VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS
SENT AFTER IT.

ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS.
MRS. LAURENCE FRAZIER SAID HER SONS, RONALD, 20, AND ROBERT 27,
SAW "PULSATING LIGHTS...SPREAD OUT OVER THE SKY." SHE SAID IT
"SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."

F. J. Allen Hynek,
Director of Dearborn Observatory &
Professor of Astronomy
Northwestern University, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO on the
night of July 15 at 9:55 till 10:30 Approximately.
Three boys plus myself, were lying on a rock ledge
listening to a baseball game, when I was looking towards
the big dipper and noticed an object moving slowly, think-
ing this was an old Echo Satellite I motioned to where it
was and said, "Look, there's an Echo satellite!"
I first noticed it as it headed east between the second
star and the third star on the handle of the big dipper and the third star.
As we're surrounded by low mountains, the big dipper was
low in the Northwest.
As we traced its path along the stars keeping it parrallel
or perpendicular to star clusters & parts of constellations,
we noticed that it changed its path twice. First, towards
the Southeast and then east again. Everytime it changed
course, it would stop for about five seconds before continuing.
As it was twenty degrees (approximately) from the horizon,
it stopped. At this time we could see it change colors from
yellow to red to yellow to red, etc. like an airplane beacon
at an airport but sometimes slow and sometimes fast.


- page 14 -

As we watched it there, hovering, for ten minutes, we saw it grow a little dimmer. I suggested that we go home for my telescope and bring it back.

We ran the mile to my house in 3 minutes and I took the car back to the ledge. When we got there, the object was still there but going dim. I tried to get a fix on it but it had already grown dim on my sight on my telescope was off as I haven't used it in nearly six months.

As we left the ledge, the object was still in the same place but was very, very dim.

Could you explain this to me? Four pairs of eyes don't lie!

I am sixteen years old and a Junior in Shamokin Area High School.

Young truly,
Shamokin, Penna.

P.S. Please reply

The following report provides information concerning the sighting of a UFO at Sherborn, Massachusetts on 15,16 July 1965 10:30 PM and 2:00 AM EDT by Harriette A. Abbott a resident of Sherborn and a licensed airplane pilot.

This subcommittee is still in the process of evaluating over 40 UFO reports received from early in July to the date of writing. Several have been eliminated as Venus, a huge kite carrying a flare, the echo satellite and misidentification of an aircraft. Because of the volume of reports being received, detailed accounts and our evaluation will be slow coming to NICAP. The continuing "flap" is actually making us "UFO-weary" ???

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET

UFO Report - 7/15/5 & 7/16/5

WITNESS: [redacted]                   PLACE: [redacted] Road, Sherborn, Mass.
[redacted], Massachusetts     TIME:   1st Sighting- 10:30 PM EDT
                                      2nd Sighting- 2:00 AM EDT

BACKGROUND:
The report was carried in the "Herald News"(o), Fall River, Mass. dated 7/21/5. A personal interview was objected to because so many callers including the press, 3 NICAP members and a local UFO Group had already phoned. I did interview her by phone and she filled out a NICAP report form which I have enclosed.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT # 1:
The object sighted at 10:30 PM was a self-luminous light source comparable in size to a bright star. It was observed traveling on a straight course slower than an aircraft from a 70° elevation in the west to the southern horizon where it was obscured by distant trees. The unusual features about the object were it carried no blinking aircraft identification lights and it moved along with a distinct "bouncing" motion. It was not resolvable through binoculars.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT # 2:
The object was sighted at 2:00 AM EDT 15 - 20° above the western horizon. The witness, curious about her first sighting was awake observing the western sky. (Her bedroom has a screen door which opens on a small desk giving her an unobstructed view of the western sky.) She noticed a reddish star where it had not been earlier. She went out on the sun deck to get a better look. Observing the object changed. She noticed that the object seemed to have a stationary center of yellow light, a stationary green light and a red light which rotated around the object. She positioned it on a fixed object and ascertained that it was hovering. After waiting several minutes she then saw the object begin to move slowly with a distinct "hovering" motion as a straight course toward the north where it disappeared behind distant trees.

EVALUATION:
During both sightings the sky was clear and many stars were visible. No moon was noticed. At that rise at 12:22 in the east. No transits of Venus were noted. Focusing satellite were due at the UTC times. The witness has a private pilot's license and is familiar with aircraft. The "bouncing" motion and hovering aspect are typical characteristics. I spoke with base ops of Hanscom Factory, the caliber of the witness and the many other UFO sightings in this general area in July warranted a report to NICAP.

Respectfully submitted,
[signature]
Raymond E. Fowler

Buenos Aires
15 July 1965

The full account of these above-mentioned incidents occupies a full page in each of four consecutive editions of the Buenos Aires newspaper "Cronica," (9/24/65-9/27/65), and space permits us to give here only the first of the incredible series of events. On the night of July 15th, while driving home from the Hotel De La Entrada, the Buenos family was sighting described as follows: "It was a very large object, very luminous, bluish in color; but the color varied at times to orange-red. It was quite near us. It had the shape of a short cone, although we could not see clearly where its upper part ended, as its surface was engulfed in a haze which was being emitted from on top. The bottom part was circular and convex. Taking the nearby hills as a reference, we estimated that it was 10 to 15 meters (yards) in diameter. In a moment we too were engulfed in a luminous haze. The object remained stationary, and no noise was heard....After a long moment, it descended below a nearby hill, and the ground hid it, but we continued seeing the light it produced. Finally, the light went out completely. We then continued our journey to the ranch, where we found that the laborers had seen it also."

Asuncion, Paraguay
13 Jul 65

SAUCERS WITH LIGHTED WINDOWS IN PARAGUAY: Of the dozens of good sightings from South America of recent date, space news print only a few of the most sensational. Five of these occurred near Asuncion, Paraguay, on the night of July 13th. Five people traveling in an open jeep saw a group of three UFOs in the sky. They remained in view for about five minutes, and were closing enough for the witnesses to distinguish clearly, on each, a row of windows or all 13 lights, according to one of the startled witnesses. The color of the objects alternated between blue, white, orange, and red. No sound whatsoever was heard.
