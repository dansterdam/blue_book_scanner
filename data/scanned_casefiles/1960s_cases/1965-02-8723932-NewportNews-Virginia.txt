Cylinder smaller on one end than the other. No sound trail or unusual features. Had green and yellow lights surrounding a large white light. Stationary. Observed from sidewalk in front of house.

Ground-Visual

7. COURSE
Stationary

CONTINUED: Jupiter at 230 deg azimuth 60 deg elevation reported at 55 deg. Observation of body does not appear to parallel observation of an object larger than the moon. Not likely that an object of this size and nature would go unobserved by others. At 70 ft an viewed from a city the size of Newport News (and surrounding area). Investigators regarded the reliability of the witness as questionable. As the investigation suggested it is possible that a light such as an a/c landing light might have been the cause of the observation. In view of the questionable evidence the report is eval as

h. There was no other unusual activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

i. There was no interception of the object.

j. Numerous aircraft were in the area at the time sighting.

k. This report was prepared by Captain William L. Bishop (DCC-S), Langley AFB, Virginia, Jr. He stated that he observed an object, larger than the moon, for approximately ten minutes before calling his neighbor to see it. He turned to tell his neighbor what he had seen when he turned back toward the object, it had disappeared. The neighbor saw nothing unusual at all. Investigation revealed no other such sightings. It would be unusual for an object described as being very large and over a heavily populated area to be undetected. The observed object could have been an aircraft with landing lights on flying toward the observer which would make it appear relatively stationary. A couple with a lack of corroborating evidence of a sighting raises a question as to whether the report concerns a valid UFO within the definition of paragraph 1b, AFR 200-2.

1. There is no existence of physical evidence.
