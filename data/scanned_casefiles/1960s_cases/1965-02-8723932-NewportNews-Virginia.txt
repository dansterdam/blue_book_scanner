The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

There was no other unusual activity or condition which might account for the sighting.

1. There was no interception of the object.

3. Numerous aircraft were in the area at the time sighting.

4. This sighting was observed by Captain William L. Bichop (DOC-9), Langley AFB, Virginia. Mr.* * * * * stated that he observed an object, larger than the moon, for approximately ten minutes before calling his neighbor to see it. He turned to tell his neighbor what he had seen. The neighbor had disappeared. The neighbor had also investigated the sighting and had described seeing the object which appeared to be larger than the moon and was described as being unusual for the time of evening. The observed object could have been an aircraft with landing lights on flying toward the observer which would make it appear relatively stationary.

1. There is no existence of physical evidence.
