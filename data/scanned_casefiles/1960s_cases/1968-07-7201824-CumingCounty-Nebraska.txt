PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 28/1400, 28/1900Z
2. LOCATION: Cuming County, Nebraska
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: D Yes, X No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: D Yes, X No

10. CONCLUSION: Probable Other (PLASMA)
It is quite possible that sighting is of an air plasma which resulted from the associated E & M effects from a daylight meteor that was seen in the area at the approximate time of the sighting.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a tear drop shaped object that was "iridescent-ultra-violet" in color. The phenomena was slightly higher than the high tension lines nearby but in no way connected to them. The phenomena disappeared in a shower of gold colored sparks.

Request for UFO Information

Washington, DC 20024

1. Reference your letter of August 4, 1968, with regards to an
unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on 23 July 1967, near Beaton, New Hampshire. Attached is the ground plot of a typical holdup. Since there were several over the United States during the time period you were interested in, only a typical ground plot was made. The survey itself may be either flight line, or satellite, or ground visual sightings. As indicated, the particular one was near Beaton, Mass. Since time satellites characteristically have a stellar compass of +10 to +15 the observers could read a local telescope to see one.

2. You may find the enclosed case from Cuming County, Nebraska, which occurred on 23 July 1968, interesting. Unfortunately, we have no 1st or 2nd reliability of the observer.

Sept. 12, 1968

Dear Hector:

I'm delighted to receive the Cuming County, Nebr. UFO report of July 20, 1968, for its shows peculiar and interesting phenomenon near Hartenton lines that I think was involved in the most famous of the Exeter, N.H. sightings.

I've written to Rogers for a few more details, including a sketch of the locale.

In sure that you have developed a sort of 6th sense in spotting the obvious hoaxes and in spotting the secret. Honest reports. While I might be prejudiced on this one-because it supports my hypothesis-I tend to believe those reports where the person limits themselves strictly to describing what they have seen, without trying to interpret it.

Now, since Rogers does not refer to "object" or "spacecraft", I suppose, I suspect he was not so previously. (But in my later correspondence with him I will sound him out on this point.) Roughly, he seems vaguely had NOT heard of the association of UFO and power lines (where it is suggested that the UFOs are sabotaging or drawing power from the lines) because he proceeds that there was no physical contact with the lines-almost as if he thought there really no relationship.

And of course his description of the object, and how it disappeared, it precisely what one should expect.

Thanks also for the _______ photo. I have begun to dig into this case in more detail and now believe that Murphy was NOT involved (I suspect a hoax). BUT I THINK THAT WAS NOT WASHINGTON KOMIYA COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR A STAR THAT MOVES BACKWARDS!

550 "N" Street, SW
Washington, D C 20024

Dear Phil:

You may find the attached material an interesting addition to the 23 July 1963 sighting from Cuming County, Nebraska, by William C. Rogers. The section on Electronics Disturbances during Fireball events is a chapter from Memorandum EM-3724-ARPA, July 1963, entitled, "Anomalous Sound and Electromagnetic Effects Associated with Fireball Entry" by Mary F. Rowig and Donald L. Lamar, both of whom work for Rand Corporation. The second is of a Fireball that was sighted at 1:45 pm, CDT, from Iowa.

I do not have a good trajectory for the meteor but I feel it probably impacted near Atlantic, Iowa, and it is quite conceivable that it passed over Cuming County, Nebraska, which isn't all that far from the probable point of impact.

I have included part of my investigation on this meteor. If you want our entire report, I can have it Xeroxed for you; however, it would probably be more profitable to contact Mr. Glitron, Center for Short Lived Phenomena, Smithsonian, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138, for details of the sighting. By the way, his telephone extension is 343.

I've requested complete weather data for the Cuming County sightings which I'll send as soon as I receive it.

VI. ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCES DURING FIREBALL EVENTS

Astrovitch calls the various electromagnetic phenomena observed during fireball passage "meteoroelectric" and "meteoromagnetic".(14)

Electromagnetic effects could arise, for instance, if a net charge accumulated in the trail of the fireball. The charged trail could perturb the earth's electric field in much the same way as a thundercloud. Lightning, ball lightning, and St. Elmo's fire might be seen, and local discharges could occur on the vegetation. It is also possible that motion of the plasma around the fireball through the earth's magnetic field could induce ground currents which would cause perturbations in the magnetic field. Also, electromagnetic radiation could result from acceleration of charged particles in the trail. Each of these actions could cause radio static and a variety of electromagnetic effects.

There is a paucity of evidence that meteorelectric disturbance during fireballs. Astrovitch reports a few instances which he attributes to St. Elmo's fire or ball lightning: The first occurred during the fireball of November 29, 1962 (old calendar), near the village of Novye Bogi, in which "fire fell to the earth in many places and on the roads and dwellings like burning ropes, and people ran and at round after them." On November 12, 1962, many people saw "fire around and near them" during the flight of a large fireball near Dijon, France. The Nazepli, Mexico, meteorite was accompanied by fine matter. "The correl was bathed in luminescent light and there were small sparks in the air which gradually disappeared."(15)

In the first example, the "fire" followed the lightning over the people. The second item is so vague that the "fire" could be attributed to reflected light. In the third, a careful rereading of Ferrington's original description of the Nazepli fall gives the impression that the sparks seen were remnants of the trail as the meteorite cooled during its fall at lower altitudes.(16) We know of no reports of lightning occurring simultaneously with the passage of a fireball.

Other electrical disturbances have been observed in more recent years. According to eyewitnesses of the Middle fireball of February

19, 1900, the city's electric-light system lit up and went out during the flight; it occurred before the detonation and earth tremor.(40) A witness of the Kybanga fireball stated that "the fireball caused the electric wires on the front of our neighbor's house to burn out."(41) (42)

This report was not corroborated by other observers.(43) Like(44) gives another example of an electrical effect associated with the passage of an "evening bright" fireball near Charleston, South Carolina, in 1954. Shortly before the meteor exploded, scatter occurred on the signal received at the local weather bureau from a radiosonde, a balloon-borne instrument which transmits weather information. The radiosonde was located at an altitude of 10.65 km, and the signal went out completely at the instant of explosion. A high-pitched note was heard between the time of contact and blackout. Krinov reported an electromagnetic effect associated with the Sikhotc-Aline meteorite of 1947; an electrician on a telephone pole within 15 km of the fall zone received a strong electric shock from the wires at the instant of flash of the meteor.(45) One could hardly attribute this to pure coincidence.

Because the lines were disconnected at the time the shock was felt, it is evident that the passage of the fireball coincided with a current induced in a long line. It is well-established that this type of induction occurs during strong auroral displays.(46) Astapovich asserts that the above example, the auroral disturbances, and sympathetic sparking during thunderstorms are analogous in effect. The causes, however, are different, for auroral currents are magnetically induced, an lightning is an electrostatic phenomenon.

Magnetic disturbances during fireball passage are difficult to observe; the observer is rarely prepared to make measurements, and the accounting instruments which are available are inadequate because of slow response time. Astapovich(47) has reported observations of companion celestial bodies during fireball passage. The most recent example summarized by Astapovich occurred in 1939, when two members of the Tunguska Museum noted that the north end of a compass needle was deflected toward the east during the flight of a red fireball toward the northeast. After the fireball passed, the needle resumed its local position.

Kalashnikov built a high-response induction magnetometer in 1940. Began a series of systematic observation of the flux changes during meteor showers. (28) The apparatus consisted of a 200-m-diameter loop and a coil of insulated wire of several dozen turns, attached to a fluxmeter which measured the induced current. The large area of the loop permitted detection of fluxes as small as 10-7 oersted. Experiments made during the Decemind maximum in 1946 showed that the changes in flux of 4 x 10-8 oersted, a distant lightning discharge, 10-6 oersted, and corona on the same date, 10-5 oersted. To obtain flux of 10-7 oersted, 0.5 per cent of the kinetic energy of a 1- to 2-ton meteorite moving at 70 km/sec would have to be converted into field energy. Kalashnikov believes this is feasible, for this is close to the known energy created by a meteor. (29) To obtain a local distortion charge on the ground, or a deviation of the compass needle, 10-6 times more field energy must be available. Although Kalashnikov observed a strong pulse from a visual meteor of -8 magnitude, the flux intensity was not given. The experiments indicated that it produces a radio noise at a frequency of 1 - 5 cps. (30)

The results of subsequent research are not conclusive. Kalashnikov conducted similar experiments with more sensitive equipment and showed that there was no consistent radio emission from meteors of -5 to -1 magnitude in the frequency range from 1 cps to 500 cycles. He suggested that the statistical correlation obtained by comparing meteor and ionosphere deflections was within the limits of the experiments. (31) On the other hand, Jenkins (32) reported increased nighttime magnetic activity during several visual meteor showers. Recently Campbell found increased activity of geomagnetic variations during the 7 Aquarid, 6 Aquarid, and Perseid showers. (33) Campbell attributed the previous controversy to the fact that Hawkins made measurements close to natural background noise.

The major source of pulses on the equipment was probably lightning. Kalashnikov and Jenkins operated in periods of low lightning noise.

The difficulty of distinguishing meteor-magnetic effects from natural atmospheric noise also prevents a good correlation.

disturbances with fireballs or meteor showers. Disturbances from industrial sources and static from lightning must also be considered.

It is difficult to tell from the descriptions given by observers what kind of radio noise was heard. According to Astapovich, there is a difference between self-generated meteor noise and the signal received by reflection of a broadcast wave from the fireball. The noises are certain crackling sounds noticed on a "clean" background.

These are supposedly emitted by the meteor and trail. Doppler whistles are observed against normal broadcasting background and could be a result of reflection from the moving plasma. (18)

On the other hand, at the fireball were generating an electromagnetic signal, Doppler shift would also be observed in a result of the fireball motion. Such a Doppler shift has been noted in the signals received from orbiting satellites. (22)

Radio noises described as a succession of short clicks were heard in Ashabad in 1944, at the end of visible flight of a fireball. These noises were sporadic and were received best in the long-to-medium-wavelength broadcast bands. There was some coordination with meteor brightness, but some faint meteors were "radiocoustic," while some brighter meteors were "mute." Astapovich attributes this lack of correlation to inhomogeneities of the atmosphere. (23) Kilman and McKinley made a survey of 30-m point observations of meteors and observed that some bright meteors emitted a signal independent of transmitted radar signal. (33)

The frequency range of this emission, which may be related to the meteor, is not known at the present time.

Reports of very unusual radio noises occurring simultaneously with the passage of a fireball could be attributed to a Doppler effect. It is unlikely that static would account for the comment, "I heard a strange sound...over the radio." I have never heard a sound on the radio like it." Such an observation was made at the time of the Pennsylvania fireball of January 1952. (24) Crackling sounds were heard on radios during the fall of the Perovskaya Poselok meteorite on December 26, 1952, and during the Kheovka meteorite of October 17, 1951. (36)

On March 24, 1933, a pilot, flying by radio beacon, noted an atmospheric roar at the time the Przybylski fireball passed; a review

of the literature on this fireball has, however, failed to substantiate
this statement, which is not referenced by Astapovich. Krinov and
Astapovich estimate that several hundred kilowatts of power are
emitted by the fireball sources of radio interference. A reception
field of 10 - 100 μv/m is assumed, which would be heard only on receivers with a 10-kc or more bandwidth. This could account for the
relatively few reported instances of radio interference. Wide variations in radio-interference reception could also be explained if the
intensity of the effect was a function of the relative direction of
the trajectory and local magnetic-field lines, i.e., if the emission
was due to some magnetohydrodynamic process.

IOWANS SIGHT
METEOR IN DAY

An extremely rare daytime meteor was sighted over Iowa on the Sunday afternoon by at least two observers.

K. B. Newcomer, 205 Thirty-eighth st., reported he was driving west on Highway 92 near Martensdale, in Warren County when he saw a short control in the western sky which was followed by a bright red half ball of fire with a yellow center. He said the flash was high in the west, and a little to the north.

What apparently was the same flash was seen by the Rev. J. Davis, 9115 Tanawanda drive, while he was driving on Interstate 80 near the Grinnell exit area. He said it occurred about 1:20 p.m.

The flash lasted only about 2-3 seconds, the Rev. Mr. Davis said. It seemed to be a little south of west.

Officials of the Smithsonian Institution's Meteor Recovery Project with headquarters at Lincoln, Neb., asked that any further sightings of the object be reported to them.

Gunther Schwartz, field supervisor, said it could have been either a meteor or a falling earth-orbiting satellite that burned up in the atmosphere.

As years that there was an unusual daylight resource (Fireball's) as
by a number of people, including on riding on July 20, 1968, near
observations were made from Iowa and the aircraft was headed toward town
at the time.

For one theory that has been proposed is that these were clouds or some of them might be produced by chunks of plasma produced in the
or some of the upper atmosphere by EL (electromagnetic) phenomena. These chunks
separate from the main wake and drift down to earth.

Perhaps the most accurate of the sighting reports of the fireball
came from an aircraft flying near some City, Iowa, and landed toward
its present heading. The fireball heading down at 145 was on daily
A few minutes later, when the aircraft passed Crabb, the captain reported
nearby a meteor heard trailing a violent red to red-orange color.

Now my question to you is this: You originally estimated the sighting
at approximately 2 p.m. Did you look at your watch or estimate the time
or was this an estimate you made later in the afternoon in trying to recall
about when this incident occurred?

Do you recall whether you examined the sky after the incident? Did
you see any unusual thin cloud-like formations, most of like an abnormal
current?

Our answer will be most helpful, as was your past assistance.

Cordially,
William J. Renn

MEMO
PHILIP J. KLASS

Dear Hector:                                     Oct. 7, 1968

Referenced the Wm. Powers/Cuming County, Nebr. UFO sighting...enclosed is a quick/dirty map plot of the location and estimated direction of the UFO sightings and the meteor sightings reported on July 26 from various points in town.

The important question is whether Rogers merely saw the meteor and badly mis-estimated its distance or whether he did indeed see a close-range plane which may have been precipitated by the meteor wake and drifted earthward.

I'm exploring the matter further with Rogers.

Dear [redacted]

This will reply to your letter dated July 31, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of your sighting. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFOs in the Project Blue Book report we have enclosed.

Sincerely,

SUBJ: Meteor report of 28 Jul 68

Mr Philip J Klass called regarding UFO meteor sighting of 28 Jul 1968, and spoke with Lt Marano. Mr Klass has contacted Mr. [redacted] and is going to get more exact azimuth and angular elevation for the UFO. He has also contacted the pilot who sighted the meteor and is going to get a complete description from him. He called Mr. [redacted] who wasn't in and talked [redacted]. The Smithsonian referred him to Von Del Chamberlain for information on the trajectory.

Told him that I had requested the trajectory from [redacted] and had also sent him a copy of the case but that Mr. [redacted] didn't seem too interested to me. Mr Klass asked if I wouldn't request the information again because of the potential scientific value of the sightings. I replied that I would. Mr Klass also wanted a complete copy of the 28 July 1968 meteor sighting. This was sent to him on the afternoon of 14 October 1963.

Dear Hector:

At long last...an interim report on the Omaha
Fireball and the Rogers UFO.
This could prove to be a very important case.

P.S. You probably will not hear much from me for the
next three months, promptly rumors that I have
(1) been kidnapped by a flying saucer, (2) gone
underground, (3) am being held by the CIA or
Men In Black, (4) my typewriter is broken.

Truth is that I am going skiing in Switzerland
for 3 weeks, and shortly after I return to U.S.
I will head back for a 5-week business trip for
aviation week to visit avionics companies in
West Europe--then will be wrapped up writing my
stories.

So please help to squelch any of the above rumors.

METEORS, PLASMAS AND UFOs

An interim report on an unusual plasma-like UFO sighted in broad daylight northwest of Omaha, Nebr., on July 28, 1968, at approximately the same time a significant meteor was passing over the same area which impacted approximately 120 miles southeast of the UFO locale, near Atlantic, Iowa.

This case provides circumstantial evidence which appears to confirm a hypothesis advanced earlier by Ferdinand de Wiess, Assoc. Professor at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, that some UFOs might be plasmoids created under freak conditions out of the wake of meteors.

No portion of this report may be published without written permission of the author.

Early in September of 1968, the Air Force Project Blue Book office sent me the following UFO report which it had received from Washington.
[Copy]

                                                                31 July 1968

Dear Sir:

This is to report an Unidentified Flying Object as follows:

At about 2 P.M. July 28 on the farm in Cuming County, Nebr., I became aware of a tear drop shaped object in the sky, more or less 100' from me in an easterly direction and at about the height of the electric power lines which cross the farm.

The object could have been 6-12' in length, but it was not an object -- it was a phenomenon of light or electricity. The heavy end of the tear drop was toward the earth & the tapered end was up -- The color was shining blue.

As I watched, it burst open with blinding light & then disintegrated into fragments of light. There was no noise. Nothing came down. No one saw this but me, & I have told no one except Mrs. Crouter. At the time I was on the base of a small lake on Farm doing some brush clearing work for here.

Temperature was approx. 88-F. Sky was cloudless. Sun was very hot.

The incident occupied a small but indeterminate number of seconds. There was no noise. This was not a man-made object nor was any human associated with it.

If you wish to question me, I am available.

Very sincerely,
(Signed)

The USAF has sent one of its standard UFO report forms to fill out. From his response, the following additional details emerge:

1. The time was approximately 2 p.m., and [text blacked out] emphasized "approximately."

2. The duration of the sighting was estimated at "Approx. 30 sec." (Later reduced this figure sharply.)

3. When asked to describe the object's appearance, [text blacked out] wrote: "Incandescent-- ultra-violet. Self-luminous. Edges sharp. The phenomenon hung in the sky"

the arc from electric welding- the object glowed steadily with exceptional
brightness. It did not flicker. It did not move."

7. In a final summary, wrote: "While I was working beside the lake short,
I became aware of an intensely brilliant, tear-drop or pear shaped object in
the sky--approx. 200 yards away on the other side of high tension electric
wires, but not connected to them in any way. Color was ultra-violet--incan-

On Sept. 12, 1968, I wrote introducing myself as a private UFO

that some UFOs may be from other than known conditions, be created
along power lines. His reply is reproduced below in its entirety, despite some
precaution, to enable the reader of this report to "size up" the

Dear Mr. Klass:

Sept. 19, 1968

The transmission lines near which I observed the UFO were those of the West
Point - Blair, Nebr. This was in response to my question. P.J.K.] Their address is
West Point, Nebr. No one connected with the REM knows I observed the UFO, and
it is possible that no one with REM knows me, since I am a visitor.

On my next visit to West Point I will pace off the distance if you wish, but
I was not less than 100 yds from the UFO -- this hung suspended in the clear sky at
the height of the transmission lines & anywhere between 20' and 50' from them.
NOTE: Pacing subsequently paced off the distance and found it to be 250 yards.]

The UFO was in the shape of a perfect tear drop and it hung motionless in the
sky while I observed it--approx. a second or more--it was at a level of the high
tension lines, on the other side of the lines from me and I could not estimate if it

was 20' or 50' from the lines. The outline was as sharp as if a huge Xmas tree ornament hung in the sky. This seemed to be a three dimensional object and the surface seemed glazed as well as glowing with light. It was not inhabited & not managed by any persons. Its color was a pure, brilliant ultra-violet-glowing, or iridescence.

When the UFO opened up or burst open, the inner lining was a very brilliant sun yellow, intense glow. This interior could be seen for a measurable fraction of a second. Then it disintegrated into a number of glowing, tear-drop shaped fragments, each of which went out separately & at different, minute intervals of time. Falling, all of this incident there was perfect silence. No fragments or traces remained & there were no odors. All disappeared in mid-air. Nothing reached the ground. These was no disturbance of leaves or grass. [redacted] then drew a sketch of the locale which is re-drawn below.]

The UFO which I have described is the third phenomenon I have observed in my life. About 3 years ago, approaching the Black Hills in S. Dakota during a darkly gathering storm with much lightning, I observed the following from S. to N. [Rogers' sketch is redrawn below.]

[A hand-drawn sketch of multiple elongated oval/teardrop shapes in two rows]

It was as if small tear-shaped droplets of lightning had been cast from S. to N. over a wide area of black sky above the Hills. This irregular pattern of droplets of light lasted 3 times. I was not a hallucination. The pattern was very clear and repeated 3 times. I did not report it.

More than 20 years ago, I observed a sun-colored ball of light or fire rolling along a high tension wire on a clear afternoon. My memory of the circumstances is too vague. I was in a car & remarked emphatically upon this brilliant sun-ball's rolling along the wire-But the other people in the car were so engrossed in their instance conversation that they did not observe the phenomenon, or pay any attention to my remark.

This was not a transient phenomenon. The fire ball rolled a distinct distance.

between the two poles, but left the high tension wire & disintegrated instead of
rolling up the slope of the wire to the next pole.

If you would like to question me the next time I am in New York, let me
know & I will be glad to answer any questions whatsoever.

Very sincerely,

Experienced UFO investigators usually become suspicious of "repeaters" --
persons who say they have frequently seen UFOs. But since Mr. [redacted] does not
attach any exotic explanations to any of his sightings and did not report the
first one, I find no reason to question his story. As a senior railroad engineer,
he spends much of his time out-of-doors with his "eyes peeled."

On Sept. 21, I wrote to the Cuming County Public Power District to ask
whether there were any discoloration or damage on the lines through the
Crouter Farm on July 28 at approximately 2 p.m. Their Oct. 4 reply indicated
there had been none. The letter said they do not normally have corona problem
on the line. Its voltage is 34,500 volts and the lines are approximately 25ft.
above the ground. In subsequent correspondence I learned that the lines run
due east-west through the Crouter Farm.

Early in October, Project Blue Book sent me new data which cast the
report in a new light. A large daylight meteor had been sighted on July 28 at
approximately 1:05 p.m. (CDT) which apparently passed over the general area of
the Crouter Farm and entered 120 miles to the southeast, near Atlantic, Iowa.

There were numerous eyewitness reports on the meteor, including one from the
crew of a United Air Lines jetliner, flying at 31,000 ft., approximately 180 miles
east of Atlantic, had seen the meteor. Several ground observers at Atlantic
reported hearing a "muffled boom" while on a golf course and seeing a "rainbow-like
cloud" overhead. As the UAL crew approached Atlantic 17 minutes later (2:02 p.m.)
it said it could still see the meteor trail at an altitude estimated at 60,000 ft.

The near-coincident time and location of the [redacted] UFO sighting and the
meteor, officially called the "Omaha Fireball," suggests that the two events
might have been related. Several possibilities are worth consideration:

1. Was the UFO really the meteor fireball?
2. Was the UFO really the persistent meteor trail?
3. Was the UFO an after-image of the fireball itself?
4. Was the UFO a plasma formed out of the meteor's plasma wake?

I wrote [redacted] to ask how certain he was of the time of his sighting. Had he
immediately looked at his watch, or was it sometime later that he had attempted to
estimate the time of the incident. He replied that it was the latter, so his 2 p.m.
estimate was only approximate. He said he had returned to work "after a long noon
hour which did not begin until well after 12 noon."

It would be convenient if one could rule out the possibility that was looking at the fireball itself, or its subsequent trail, on the ground. That it was both his local horizon. Unfortunately this is not possible. The United Air Lines airplane was flying at 31,000 ft., and its crew estimated that the meteor trail was at approximately 60,000 ft., but in all probability this was much too low. And if the 60,000 ft. altitude were correct, an object at this altitude would have been above the local horizon, assuming flat terrain on the Crouter farm.

Over-exposed Polaroid prints of the sighting, locale which sent me show, however, a rolling landscape in which the power lines appear to be on a low ridge, perhaps 10-15 ft. above the local terrain at which point was standing. I have not taken the time to obtain topographical maps for more precise estimates since it is probable that the meteor rose a good deal higher than 60,000 ft. and since its exact altitude is unknown, it would not be wise to exclude the meteor from consideration on the grounds that it was below the horizon.

Instead, I contacted a number of eyewitnesses and, without any mention of the UFO, asked them to confirm or review and examine their observations as reported in the local press accounts, to compare with description.

Here is a summary of their individual observations. (See map for their approximate position relative to entry.)

UAL Capt (Driving southeast of Atlantic): Object (red) appeared to be traveling straight down or slightly north to south course. Smoke trail visible from this sighting until passing underneath approximately 17 minutes (later) at 420 kts. per hour ground speed. [Pilot then gave coordinates of the meteor trail in Vor-DME coordinates. Estimate (site) altitude (as) 50,000 ft. (wind conditions were) 80 kt. at 31,000 ft. from 265 deg.] Duration of the fireball sighting was estimated at 2 seconds. Fireball was dead-ahead and first sighted at elevation angle estimated to be 30 deg. above horizon; object disappeared from view at elevation of 20 deg. (estimated.)

(Driving southeast of Atlantic) Reported seeing "a short contrail center. He said the flash was high in the west and a little to the north." (See Newspaper Register, date): Nov. 23, 1968, to say the newspaper account was accurate. He added that "it was a frame clear, sunny day and I observed this through the top of the windshield which is well tinted and it is possible that without the tint in the glass I might not have seen it. The incident covered only a few seconds..."The whole picture

Rev (Driving west, located ENE of Atlantic): According to his Moines Register, Davis apparently saw the same flash which lasted "only about 2-3 seconds."

(Reply to my letter)[Observer was on ground in Atlantic]:
"There were several small scattered clouds in the sky at this time and looking, to the southeast and west, a small group of these had brilliant coloring in green, pink and reddish orange. I saw no trail of pattern of direction of the meteor at all. The colors remained in the clouds for at least 10 minutes and then faded away."

Mrs. (Reply to my letter)[Ground observer in Atlantic]: "lasted about 10-15 minutes after I saw it before the colors faded away." She drew a sketch

showing a series of concentric rings, which I presume to be clouds. The inner core was marked: "Head and brilliant orange colors being intermingled." The next ring was marked "Fainter colors" and the outer rings were labeled: "very faint yellows."

Through the kindness of [redacted], whose sister-in-law lives near Atlantic, I received several clippings of unknown date from what I presume to be the Atlantic News Telegraph. One contains an account by a farmer [redacted] who lives near Atlantic and reported seeing the meteor at approximately 1:45 p.m.

[redacted] was quoted as describing it this way: "It looked like the moon in the midday sky and my first thought was that it was a burning plane, then I realized a flare aircraft wouldn't be a ball of fire that large." He called for his wife to come outside but "by the time she got there, it had burned itself out and looked like a ball of phosphorus, leaving a trail of smoke in its wake."

Another clipping, presumably from the same newspaper but a later issue, tells of the visit to investigate the meteor case. By triangulation of numerous reports from western Iowa [redacted] was quoted as saying that the meteor "was probably traveling from a northwesterly to a southeasterly direction."

If this estimate is correct, the meteor's path would have taken it roughly over the area where [redacted] reported his UFO sighting had occurred.

* * *

[redacted] returned to the Crouter farm later in the year to pace off the distance to the power lines and refresh his memory, and from information provided by the power company that its lines run east-west through the Crouter farm, he concluded that he had been looking, roughly to the southeast when he saw the UFO. This would mean that he was looking in the direction of Atlantic--and roughly along the flight path of the meteor--so far as is known.

All the evidence points to the fact that the meteor trail over Atlantic persisted for at least 17 minutes, based on the Ohu pilot report, and then that it faded gradually. The position of the UFO is that it disintegrated after a matter of a couple of seconds, and his initial report volunteered that there was not a cloud in the sky. On this basis, it seems safe to rule out the possibility that the UFO was actually the meteor trail.

The brevity of the observation period of the UFO closely matches the time duration of the fireball sighting, suggesting that the two might involve the same object. The eyewitness reports of the meteor fireball describe it as bright and nearly stationary. All observers of the meteor described the UFO as being stationary.

Could these impressions have been an "after-image" -- an illusion caused by the intense red fireball? (I profess no expertise at all on this subject.)

Is it possible that a fast-moving red fireball which was actually 120 miles away could be mistaken for a stationary, bluish-white object only 250 yards away?

On Oct. 11, I wrote [redacted] and in the closing portion of my letter I asked if it was possible that what he had seen might really have been a meteor some 120 miles away, and not a few yards away, to see what his reactions would be to this suggestion.

replied (in part) as follows: "The UFO was not in the nature of an explosion. It hung fixed in the clear air. The tear drop shape was clear and clean. The complete outline from upper tip to lower bulb were sharp and fixed. The UFO remained in position for an observable interval of time. Its disintegration was not in the nature of an explosion--it was as if the tear drop envelope ripped apart. I saw the gold interior. Then the interior condensed into fragments, gold colored, which 'went out' separately. All appeared NEAR (1)--yet--

"Yes, your letter is correct -- the UFO could have been at ANY height and ANY distance. I am clear that from where I stood the high (tension) lines were in my direct line of vision to the UFO. Yet vision and visual estimates vary from fixed standards of comparison may well be compounded with illusion. I feel somewhat at fault for not acknowledging this previously, but my illusion was so clear.

"Yes, it is possible the UFO might have been a meteor exploding at any distance and any altitude, but that put off this possibility was the illusion or impressions described again above that I saw at fixed in space, that the tear drop outlines were clear and that there was NO movement as in a trajectory."

Clearly Mr. [redacted] has no vested commitment that the object was a "genuine UFO", as do some observers, for which he is to be complimented.

* * *

During the course of this investigation, I chanced to be re-reading the paper which had not delivered in its (long) entirety, the following caught my eyes:

"Quite early in my own examination of the UFO problem, I was confronted by colleagues at the University of Arizona with challenges on the grounds that UFOs could be some unrecognized form of plasmoid. For example, scientists at our Lunar and Planetary Laboratory proposed that, since the wake of an entering meteoroid is a plasma and since a meteor sets up a highly turbulent wake-flow, perhaps vortical rotations on the meteor-wake boundary could spin off masses of incandescent plasma that descend into the lower atmosphere and are reported as a UFO..."

[redacted] proceeded to reject this as completely impossible!

Recently, I have been able to track down the scientist who advanced this novel hypothesis. He is [redacted] of engineer of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. Previously [redacted] was engaged in plasma physics research for [redacted] in connection with that company's work in ballistic missile nose cone recently.

On Dec. 20, 1968, I wrote to [redacted], telling him only briefly of a recent UFO case which might provide support for his earlier hypothesis. I asked him to outline briefly his ideas, which he has done, informally, in his reply of Jan. 7, 1969. Copy of his letter is contained in the appendix.

This report has been prepared as an interim status report for a handful of scientists who may be interested in this case in the hope of sparking interest and comment.

Mr. Philip J. Klass
Senior Avionics Editor
National Press Building
Washington, D. C. 20004

Dear Mr. Klass:

It is with great pleasure that I read your interesting letter December 20, 1968. I would like to congratulate you, as you are to knowledge the first to establish a case of space and time coincidence between the occurrence of these two elusive phenomena: ball lightning, the entrance of a large meteor into the atmosphere.

Some fifteen years ago I became involved in theoretical and experimental research in the field of plasmas at pressures of the order of atmospheric pressures. It was then, while working with stable plasma configurations, I became intrigued by plasmoid (ball lightning) occurring in nature, phenomenology and origin.

In answer to an implied question in your letter, I would like to present a few of the thoughts that--at that time--led me to suggest that large plasmoids may be generated during the passage of meteors through the atmosphere.

Among the great number of ball lightnings reported over the last hundred years were many with diameters up to several meters and with an observed life of less than minutes. In many cases the reports indicate the absence of thunderstorm activities or even heavy clouds in the area of sighting.

It is more than difficult to construct a model of a plasmoid exceeding centimeters in diameters and a life of more than minutes if we assume its origin from magneto hydrodynamic processes of our atmosphere only. However, the entry of a large meteor into our atmosphere can supply the parameters needed to explain plasmoids of much larger size and longer life.

The energy released into the wake of a meteor is sufficient to cause complete ionization, whereas the plasma produced by a lightning strike is only partially ionized.

The volume of the plasma produced in the stagnation zone and augmented by the excited meteor material is magnitudes greater than the volume of plasma generated by a lightning discharge. This together with the high velocity of the wake plasma relative to the free atmosphere, suggest the spinning off of large plasma eddies in the shearzone.

The passage of meteors through the atmosphere has been observed to generate strong electromagnetic fields. (In the twenties a meteor early in the Southwest produced electromagnetic at a distance of 150 miles from its path.) An electromagnetic transient of such magnitude might cause a given plasma eddy to be stabilized into a plasmoid. It might also provide the force lines along which stabilized into a plasmoid.

such a plasmoid might be moved from the high altitude of its formation downwards to lower altitudes, against its buoyancy.

This characteristic of plasmoids, to move along magnetic force lines, seems to be common for many reported sightings of ball lightning, as for instance, the disproportionately large number of sightings in areas of magnetic anomalies (geomagnetic) and the prevalence of their occurrence near transformer stations and powerlines.

The observed long life of some plasmoids is difficult to interpret if they are assumed to contain gases of our atmosphere only, gases of high ionization potential. Meteor wakes contain, however, sublimated meteor material, that is, practically the whole periodic table of elements. In consequence the presence, among the components of a plasmoid, of elements of the lower end of the table, with their low ionization potentials, should substantially extend its life.

I know of only few reported observations of the collapse of ball lightning but they reflect the expected effects of implosion and release of recombination energy, by describing carbonized vegetation and sand fused into glass at the point of ground contact.

I hope that the foregoing will help you to show that a rather large body of evidence points in the direction of our terrestrial environment as the origin for many reported UFO's and that a considerable amount of research in this direction should be done before we go off into formulating theories that belong in science fiction.

Sincerely yours,
