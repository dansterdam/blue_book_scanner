27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968

CENTERVILLE, OHIO                                                   7 JULY 1966

Case should have been followed up.  Only a local phone call would have been necessary. There were four witnesses; man and wife and two children.  Now, more than two years later, a follow-up hardly seems needed.

Since many objects were observed all in one place, not moving around--and an explosion was heard--one wonders, in view of the closeness to July 4, whether this could have been a belated July 4th celebration.

"Upside down coffee cups" suggest parachutes.  Perhaps rocket launched?  I have seen children; toys consisting of small rockets which eject a small parachute on the way down.

I think this sort of explanation has equal weight to "possible aircraft"  Aircraft do not look like upside down coffee cups, and do not explode (well, rarely!)

CORRESPONDENCE

TO: Prof. B-bluebook         FROM: J.A. Hynek        DATE: 7 Jul 66

Re.: Centerville, O. case of 7/Jul/66.

Case started has been
concluded up. Only a local
phone call was used then
necessary. It was 4 witnesses,
man and wife + 2 children. Now
more than two years later, a
follow-up seems needed.

Since many objects were normal,
all in one place not moving around -
and one would to July 4, watch
the closeness to July 4 - a belated
July 4th celebration. Suggest play outside
- perhaps rocket parachute launched?
I now see constantly of small parachute
curtain light a small parachute (over)

I think this sort of
explanation has aged me up a bit
possible during. A wrong
do not look like typical down
... case, copy, and so not
(well, maybe;).

it occurred at a small airport and the duration was once and a half minutes.  Follow-up should have been made to determine whether there were other potential witnesses.  Since it occurred at mid-night on December 28, it is possible that there were no witnesses available.  Must be carried as unidentified, since no witnesses.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
    One witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds.  Witness was a 67 year old lady.  Sighting occurred at 9 p.m. day saving time in the middle of August, and thus the sky so still have been reasonably bright.  Witness said sighting was at night and sky very blue.  Perhaps she thinks that anything after 6 p.m. is night.  Must be listed as unknown (meager data, single witness, very short duration).

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
    I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire.  I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case.  See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
    Temporarily not in file.  Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
    Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report.  Evaluation is pending my getting a copy of the Air Force investigation or same.  Based on NICAP report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
    I have only the card on this case, but judging from it there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was caused by low-flying birds reflecting light.  The sighting lasted 4 to 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
    I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it
