My father reported that at about 7:45 pm on September 16, 1967, while driving west on US Highway 67 about 15 miles east of San Angelo, Texas, he and his wife observed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be a very large aircraft. The light was first sighted at the southwest horizon and appeared to hover and move erratically. My father said the light was larger than any aircraft he had ever seen and seemed to be several miles away. The light appeared to be pulsating and at times flickering. The light remained in view for approximately 15-20 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. My father stated that he and his wife were very impressed by the unusual nature of the sighting and that they appear to be stationary while they were observing the light. In my opinion, the light was too bright and too large for a conventional aircraft. There are several witnesses and continued concern among them about this incident.

TO: San Angelo, Texas 76901

Reference your recent unidentified flying object sighting which was reported to the Air Force. The information which you have received is not sufficient for a scientific investigation. Request you complete the enclosed AF Form 117 and return it in the self-addressed envelope. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

The image contains a questionnaire titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book. The questionnaire includes a section for the observer to sketch the object they witnessed. In this case, the observer has provided a sketch of the object, which appears to be a triangular shape.

The text of the document is as follows:

BOB Nr 21-R258
SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING YOUR SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA. THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES AND YOUR NAME WILL NOT BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. RETURN TO AIR FORCE BASE SOURCE FROM WHICH YOU RECEIVED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ADDRESSED FOR RETURN.

1. WHAT DATE DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON? DAY 21, MONTH 11, YEAR 67

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 6, MINUTES 0, A.M./P.M.

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR 6, MINUTES 15, A.M./P.M.

4. TIME/ZONE: CENTRAL DAYLIGHT SAVINGS

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET ADDRESS AND INDICATE ON SKETCH WHERE YOU WERE IN RELATION TO THE OBJECT. IF IN RURAL AREA, DESCRIBE LOCATION.
San Angelo, Texas

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENON APPEARED ABOVE THE HORIZON. WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A 'Y' ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH IT APPEARED AT LAST SIGHT.

(Sketch of a triangular object with an "X" and "Y" indicating the object's position in the sky)

- page 9 -

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left appears to be a compass rose with directions labeled around the perimeter. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction of the phenomenon being observed. 

The smaller sketches on the right appear to be landscape drawings. One shows a person standing in a landscape with distant mountains or hills. The other shows a similar landscape with what looks like a bright object or light in the sky.

OCR Text Output:
HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A *" AT THE POSITION OF THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON SET SEEN.
IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A AT THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON SET SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND THE WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
APPARENT COURSE OR STRAIGHT-CURVED OR AGONAL FLIGHT, TO MALISTICALLY AND ACCURATELY DEPICT THE MOVEMENT
OF THE OBJECT AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU COMPLETE THE SKETCH.

The object appeared bright and maneuverable, it was oval in shape. At first it was about the size of a dime at arm's length, then it seemed to get smaller and then larger again. The object changed direction several times and was very bright, at times it appeared to be the size of a grapefruit at arm's length. After hovering and the object was about one half the size of the original view, it then disappeared.
