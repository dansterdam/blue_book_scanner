PROJECT 1967 RECORD

1. DATE/TIME GROUP: 12/02/67

2. LOCATION: San Angelo, Texas (2 Witnesses)

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4 Minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: S to NW

8. PHOTOS: No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: Probable (ASTRO)
At the time of the sighting, 16-20, T-38's were flying in the San Angelo area. They flew generally from NW to SE then NW. The observer stated that he first saw the object over his back yard, this statement may reference direction and elevation rather than exact position.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
When they observer first saw the object it was slightly brighter than any star. The object did not appear to move for which then it started north and as it did so, it turned red in color. The object at all times appeared as a point of light; the closest view was during observation, aside. The object then appeared just above some trees in the observers back yard. No noise was heard at any time.

CONCLUSION CONTINUE: Inasmuch as the Form 117, the observer describes it just as a point of light, or like a star. He therefore felt that the object was not very close to the ground.

FORM: FTD SEP 63 0-329 (TDE) Previous editions of this form may be used.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

My folks drove home out at new town and then we left to go visit my mother at the hospital. The weather was late that he just drove all his watch yet left out of the car and it was night 9 and p.m. When I first saw the object it was almost straight up in the sky and moving west very with white light. Six speed stated perfectly still for at least 30 sec. It seemed like it was going straight up for a while because the sight slowly became smaller. Then I flew off as it turned side at what seemed a hole. After a while it became very small I went inside to call the news and when I came back outside I could not see it. I know that yet here and there and that they appear to be stationary when they are moving a distance. In my opinion the red light was too bright and too large for a jet. There are several red entrance warning lights about five miles to the north of my house. I know that the object was not an entrance light. The object flew well past the warning lights.

When I first saw the object it was white and remained white for a while. Then and there, the object did not move for a while. Then it moved to the north. It slowly turned red until it was a very bright red. After turning red the object was about one-fourth the original size. The object was hard to judge because the object was moving away from me very fast. I can describe the object only as a point of light. I saw no evidence of its being solid.
