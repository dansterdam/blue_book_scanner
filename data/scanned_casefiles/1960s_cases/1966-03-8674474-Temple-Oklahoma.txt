Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report for 23 March 1966. In this report it indicated that you also observed the object. To aid in our evaluation we would appreciate your completing the attached FTD Form 164.

Your assistance in this matter will be appreciated.

TEMPLE, OKLAHOMA
23 MARCH 1966

Observer was driving his car along the highway at approximately 0505,
23 March 1966, when he noticed an object parked on the road in front of him.
He stopped the car and got out so as to get a better view of the object.
The
object was so parked that it blocked out a portion of a road curve sign.
There were no sharp edges noted by the observer. The object had the appearance of a conventional aircraft (C-124) without wings and motors. There was
a plexiglas bubble on top, similar to a B-26 canopy. As observer approached,
he noticed a man wearing a baseball cap enter the object by steps from the
bottom. After the man had entered the object, it began to rise from the
pavement and headed on a southeasterly direction at approximately 720 mph.
The object had forward and aft lights that were very bright. As the object
rose from the ground, a high speed drill type of sound was heard, plus a
sound like that of welding rod when an arc is struck. Object was 75' long,
nearly 8' from top to bottom and about 12' wide. There were some type of
supports on the bottom of the object.

After the object disappeared the witness got back into his car and drove
approximately fifteen miles down the highway. At this time the original witness stopped and talked with another individual who had also stopped along the
roadway to watch some lights over Red River which is approximately five or six
miles to the southeast.

COMMENTS

Various organizations were contacted around the Temple area for a possible
experimental or conventional aircraft. The observer stated that he thought the
object was some type of Army or Air Force research aircraft. All attempts at
such an explanation proved futile, since there were no aircraft in the area
at the time of the sighting.* Although there are numerous helicopters and
other experimental aircraft in the area, none could be put in the area of Temple
at approximately 0500, 23 March 1966. Because of this factor the case is
listed as unidentified by the Air Force.
