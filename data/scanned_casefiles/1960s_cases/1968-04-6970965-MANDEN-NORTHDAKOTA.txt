April 22.

Dear Sirs,

Last week April 17th my wife saw a falling object out of the sky about 11:45 p.m. It glowed all the way to the ground.

The next morning I walked across the road to hunt gophers and I spotted this piece of melted metal on the ground. She was hunting gophers in this area for the past few days and now saw it before.

The area was burned off just last fall. Under the metal the green grass was burned.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

ovi the sander that stuck
out of the grounds.

The air force base at
Colorado Springs, Col.
contacted me. They would
like a piece of it for show.
I would like to get it
tested before I start cutting
it up. Do you do this kind
of work at this base and
how big of piece would a
person have to send or should
I send the whole piece? It
weighed about 2 pounds its 11
inches long 9¾ inches wide and
about 6 in thick at thickest part.
If I could get some information
on this I would appreciate it very
much.

From Satellite or Flying Saucer?

Metal Falls on Area Farm

Harlow Haverkamp, Center Route, Mandan, has a curious piece of flat, aluminum-like metal that he believes fell out of the sky Wednesday night like a falling star.

Weather Bureau at the U.S. Weather Bureau in Bismarck who looked at the fragment suggest it may have fallen off a satellite and melted during its dizzy plunge through space.

But they aren't sure. And Haverkamp can't be sure the object he found was the same thing that streaked like a falling star.

THE FLAT PIECE is about 11 inches long, 4¾ inches at its widest point and about an inch at the thickest part. Haverkamp has scratched and sawed into the metal and it has a silver shine under its scorched exterior.

What the object is Haverkamp doesn't know. But he said he plans to find out. He said he might take it to Bismarck Junior College for examination or send it somewhere else where proper tests can be made.

Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., R. M. Helskell plant north of Mandan, lives three miles north of Mandan.

"My wife says this particle fell out of the sky when she was backing out of the yard to go to get me at work," Haverkamp said.

That would be about 11:45 p.m., Wednesday.

"It was glowing just like a falling star," he said.

The next morning, Haverkamp said, he was hunting striped gophers in the area when he spotted the object lying on the ground about 300 feet from the house and in the same direction that his wife had spotted the glowing fragment fall.

Haverkamp said there was an imprint on the ground where the piece fell. He said he had been over the area a few days before and he would have spotted the fragment if it had been there then.

At this point, he's not speculating whether he's found a piece of a flying saucer.

Letter of Appreciation

[Redacted name]
Mandan, North Dakota

1. On behalf of Aerial Phenomena Office and HQ Air Force Systems Command, may I express my appreciation to you and your wife for releasing the metallic specimen found in the vicinity of your home to our office for examination.

2. After a close examination of the item by USAF analysts, we are unable to determine the exact identity of the debris. The composition of the unit contains elements which are common, essentially aluminum and iron. The physical condition of the item precludes any substantive identification. In view of this, and per your arrangement with 1/Lt G. P. Matthews of this office, the item is returned for your retention.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
