April 3, 2

Dear Sirs,

Last week April 17th
my wife saw a falling
object out of the sky about
11,45 P.M. It glanced all
the way to the ground. 
The sight was quite unusual
across the rods to hunt
gophers and I spotted this
piece of milky matter on
the ground. The object hunting
appears in this area for the
past few days and moon
is up high.

The area was located
of last fall. Under the main
the green glow was beamed
the ground.

The image contains a photograph of a man identified as Harlow Haverkamp and a caption that says "Harlow Haverkamp and 'Thing.'" The text describes a metal object that fell on an area farm near Mandan, North Dakota. The object is described as being about 14 inches long and 8 inches at its thickest part, with a silver shine underneath. The text also mentions that Haverkamp, a fireman, was the one who discovered the object.

From Satellite or Flying Saucer?
Metal Falls on Area Farm
Route, Mandan, has a curious piece of flat, aluminum-like metal that fell on the farm of C. "R" Watkins on his farm, Mandan, Wednesday night according the U.S. Weather Bureau in Bismarck who looked at the fragment.
HAVERKAMP, a fireman at the Mandan plant north of Mandan, has three miles north of Mandan.
"My wife says this particle fell like a drop of water, when she was backing out of the yard to go to get me at work," Haverkamp said.
It was glowing about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday.
"It was glowing just like a falling star," he said.
The next morning Haverkamp said he was hunting trapped gophers in the area where this had landed this on the ground about 25 feet from the house and in the same direction that his wife said she saw the glowing fragment fall.
Haverkamp said there was an imprint on the ground where the piece fell. He said he had been over the area a few days before and he would have spotted the fragment if it had been there then.
THE FLAT PIECE is about 14 inches long, 8 inches at the thickest part, he said, describing it, and shaped and sawed into the metal and it has a silver shine under its scratched exterior.
Haverkamp says he doesn't know what it is. But he said he plans to find out if possible. He said the plan is to send it to Bismarck Junior College for examination or send it anywhere where analysis can be made.
All this point, he's not speculating on what this piece of a "flying saucer."

TOP-UFO
Letter of Appreciation

1. On behalf of Aerial Phenomenon Office and Hq Air Force Systems Command, may I express my appreciation to you and your wife for releasing the metallic specimen found in the vicinity of your home to our office for examination.

2. After a close examination of the item by USAF analysts, we are unable to determine the exact identity of the debris. The composition of the item, containing elements which are common, specially aluminum and iron, the physical condition of the item precludes any substantive identification. The investigation files, which are closed, considered this item unidentifiable.

Sincerely,

INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Lt Colonel, USAF
