1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 12 April 68 13/0152

2. LOCATION: Cape Neddick, Maine

3. SOURCE: Civilian

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: About one minute

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

7. COURSE: S to NNE

8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [X] No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [X] No

10. CONCLUSION: Possible (AIRCRAFT)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers were watching an eclipse of the moon when they sighted a flat disc shaped object with a dome. It had an extremely brilliant white pulsating light on the "head-on side and clear, brilliant red blinking red lights across the side.

COMMENTS: The description is similar to that of an aircraft with an electrical advertising sign. One advertiser who operates in the area was contacted but stated that it was not his plane. If the object had continued NNE it would have passed over Biddeford and Saco, Maine. No one reported any UFOs to their police departments. Peace AFB and Portsmouth Airport are only 10 to 15 miles SSW of the sighting and

The object was solid and was brightly illuminated by the lights on its surface. It was oval in shape, with a more pronounced rounding on the upper side. From the underside, forming a dome-like effect, there was a large blinking light. On the edge of the object was a random blinking pattern. The surface was quite energetic and seemed to change color. The object appeared to be quite bright against the sky in which the moon had almost total eclipse. The object appeared to be solid in October, although it could have been visible with the U.S. 1 road. It was a reflection of its red light.

Checking our records we indicate that first flight this year was conducted with the night equipment in night time May 14 1963. May I say again this was our first flight this season. There is no way our aircraft could create the sighting, on April 12 1963. Gladly to help your organization.

Gentlemen:

On the night of April 12, 1968, there was a total eclipse of the moon. The night, at Cape Neddick, Maine, was all clear. My niece, age 19, and I went out into the back yard of our house, which stands about 50 yards from U. S. Highway 1, at about 11:12 p.m. to watch the total eclipse. We were facing south. There was a thin sliver of light left on the moon from about three to six o'clock. After watching a few minutes (we approximate the time to 11:15), we saw and judged just below the moon moving in an easterly direction; it veered to what appeared to us, to a NNE direction. The object was a flat oval with a dome.

We heard no sound and saw no trail. From our view, we could see what appeared to be a cluster of red, blinking lights across the object, in about the position where a man's hat would be, but wider and more concentrated in the center of the object. In front, (on the head-on side and about the middle of the "crown") an extremely bright, pulsating white light was glowing. The almost complete darkness caused by the eclipse hide the object, especially clear to our view.

I particularly looked for alternating red and green lights like airplanes have, but saw nothing green. The whole object glowed in a dull, mottled red-orange. The object took less than a minute to pass from our view, still going in a NNE direction.

We are not qualified to judge distances, but the object seemed to be passing much lower than most jet planes fly.

Another person, who does not wish to be identified, saw the object. Extremely as it was, he was inside the house at the time.

The initial draft of this report was written within 12 hours of the sighting.

This report is being sent simultaneously to NICAP.

My niece and I specifically request that our names not be made public.

Yours truly,

[Signature redacted]

Dear Mrs.

This will reply to your recent letter in which you reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
