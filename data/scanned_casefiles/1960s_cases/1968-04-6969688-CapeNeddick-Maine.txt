PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 12 April 68 13/0415Z
2. LOCATION: Cape Neddick, Maine
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: About one minute
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: S to NE
8. FURTHER EVALUATION: Possible (AIRCRAFT)
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: XX No
10. CONCLUSION: Possible (AIRCRAFT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers were watching an eclipse of the moon when they sighted a flat disc-shaped object with a dome. It had an extremely brilliant white pulsating light on the "head-on side and clear, brilliant red blinking red lights across the side.
COMMENTS: The description is similar to that of an aircraft with advertised advertising signs. One advertiser who operates in the area was contacted but stated that it was not his plane. If the object had continued NNE it would have passed over Biddeford and Saco, Maine. No one reported any UFOs to their police departments. Peace AFB and Portland-Sanford Airport are only 10 to 15 miles SSW of the sighting and OVER.

Checking our records we indicate that first flight this year was conducted with the night equipment in night time May 14 1963. May I say again this was our first flight this season. There is no way our aircraft could create the sighting on April 12 1963. Gladly to help your organization.

The image appears to contain a typed report regarding a UFO (unidentified flying object) observation in Cape Neddick, Maine on April 12, 1959. The report was written by Lt. Col. Quintanilla of the United States Air Force's Aerial Phenomena Office. 

The report states that a witness from Billerica, Massachusetts reported seeing an unidentified flying object over Cape Neddick at approximately 11:15 PM on April 12, 1959. The object was described as metallic in appearance, with a bright white light in front and numerous red lights along the sides. It was observed moving from the south to the northeast, toward Portland.

The report indicates that the witness's sighting is the only electrical sighting they have on record, and requests any additional information the reader may be able to provide about the incident.

Project Blue Book Information Office
3535 X Street, N.W.
Washington, D. C. 20330

Gentlemen:

About 10:30 the night of April 14, 1968, there was a total eclipse of the moon near Cape Neddick, Maine. We were sitting on our lawn about 80 yards from our house, which stands about 80 yards from U.S. Highway 1, at about 10:45 p.m. facing south. There was a thin sliver of light on the moon from about 10:30 to 11:00, at which time the eclipse was total. 
We saw what appeared to be a cluster or red, blinking lights across the road from us. This object was emitting a pulsing, humming sound that seemed to come from it. It just hovered above the trees for about 15 minutes. There was no sound and no trail. From our view, we could see what appeared to be a cluster of red, blinking lights across the road from us. It just hovered above the trees for about 15 minutes. There was no sound and no trail. From our view, we could see what appeared to be a cluster of red, blinking lights across the road from us.

In front, (on the head-on side) we could see what seemed to be the middle of something, as if a door or window was slightly ajar. The almost complete darkness caused by the eclipse made the object stand out very distinctly.

A particularly looked for alternating red and green lights like a small airplane, but saw nothing moving. The object took less than a minute to pass out of sight. The object took less than a minute to pass out of sight.

We are not qualified to judge distance, but the object seemed to be hovering about 600 feet above the ground. As near as I could tell, the one person, who does not wish to be identified, saw the object very distinctly and it passed overhead within the same time.

The initial draft of this report was written within 12 hours of the sighting.

This report is being sent simultaneously to NICAP.

My niece and I specifically request that our names not be made public.

Yours truly,

Dear Mrs. *******,

This will reply to your recent letter in which you reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will coordinate this sighting with the appropriate personnel at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they will be able to investigate the matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. This base has a UFO investigation which is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING YOUR SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA (UAP). YOUR COOPERATION IN PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF SUCH REPORTS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY. HOWEVER, EACH REPORT IS CAREFULLY STUDIED. RETURN TO AIR FORCE BASE INVESTIGATOR FOR FORWARDING TO U.S.A.F. (ATTACH SECTIONS 1-7 OF THE REPORT FORM WITH YOUR NAME FOR IDENTIFICATION.)

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON?
DAY: 16 MONTH: 4 YEAR: 1968

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR: 11 MINUTE: 25 [A.M./P.M.]: A.M.

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR: 11 MINUTE: 55 [A.M./P.M.]: A.M.

4. TIME ZONE: [CENTRAL/DAYLIGHT SAVINGS/MOUNTAIN/PACIFIC/OTHER]: STANDARD

5. WHAT DIRECTION WAS THE OBJECT FIRST SIGHTED AND IN WHAT PART OF THE SKY WAS IT LOCATED? WHERE WERE YOU STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.
About 5 miles north of Portland, Maine on route 1A - about 3/5 miles southeast of York, Maine.

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE OBJECT APPEARED ABOVE THE HORIZON (AT THE SAME ANGLE AT WHICH IT WAS FIRST SEEN). WHEN THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN, WAS IT HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THIS POINT ON THE SAME CURVED LINE.

The sketch shows a curved line likely representing the horizon, with an "X" mark on the line at around 60 degrees above the horizon. No other markings are present.

- page 24 -

The image contains two sketches. The larger one is a compass rose diagram with labeled directions and instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The smaller sketches on the right appear to show a person standing in a landscape, with one sketch showing a more distant view.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHICH FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTIONS TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE PATH AND DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LATER SKETCH.
