16 Aug '65

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your observation on the night of 16 August 1965 has been evaluated as a satellite. The erratic flight can be attributed to illusion as one light passed another or atmospheric condition such as a temperature inversion which could cause the object to appear to have such an erratic movement.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
