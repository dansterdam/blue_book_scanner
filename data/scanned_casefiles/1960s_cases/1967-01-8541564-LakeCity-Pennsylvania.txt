Gentlemen:

I would like to report what could others through to-be a U.F.O. On the night of January 24, 1967 at about north at Lake City, Pennsylvania I and there at several with the and re-turn telescope. My position telescope was given to 8-9 program at the time it was on 5th port. We observed to seem most Regu-tion. Telescope a very small white be nearly right under a will go off and we it would be on you a second then go off and come on again. This small thing blinking and just off the moon's west side and seemed to be moving to-the moon's surface very slowly. It was about the size of a pin-head still at some length but seen on the tele-scope. There were 8 observers one would look on the sky. Telescope the other in the small telescope. I shape was oval or round. No sound. Color was white. Shadows were slow. Duration is minute in our sky telescope: 6 to 7 minutes for small telescope. U.F.O. looked like it was seated on the moon or passing very close to the moon. The big telescope which I had was being and

I sort this thing. After I got another good
in the moon at some time it was a clear
night a full moon. This sky said some
could I say my friend has a lot of
information on what was the object was
seen star or planet or even a satellite. We
waited for some to communicate it. As we could
see the object again but could not see it any
more. It was just left the moon while it
was behind a large cloud. I and I was say
ding just sit on the reviewing will be the same
in where just age and relativity. My
friend will follow - my name at the top
in the list.

March 8, 1967

Gentlemen:

I am sorry I could not send back the information sheet. My father who is a non-believer in U.S. history the information sheet. But I can still remember something on the information sheet. Here January 24 Tuesday night at 7:00 PM eastern standard time that hurried about 11 minutes. Time was judged by small clock in house, sighting was in Lake City, Pennsylvania. There were 8 observed. I repeat. I could see oval. It looked sort solid with fuzzy edges. We were outside looking through telescope. It was a cold night full moon, and scattered clouds. The other said they saw it. The moon was at a 60Â° angle when sighted. Color was a whitish color to a whitish yellow back to white. Diameter about the size of a large penhead held at arm's length. (I speed. not estimate) I heard. none heard altitude.

not estimated.
FULL-MOON

The object showed in front of the moon
Nearest street is 217 Smith St.
The moon was in this clear when
we first sighted the object. The object
seemed to be near the last end of
the moon and travel to the south of
the moon. The speed of the object ap-
pearing it over with the observer's ob-
will 7. The object looked like a oval spot
light going off and on.

When we first sighted the object it was
just off the east side of the moon was
the first one to sight it in my low
telescope. At this time we were looking
at the moon with a telescope when first
got the moon & moved my scope
a little and saw this object going off and
on it would keep doing this the object.

204 seemed to be moving to the south of
the moon. The others wanted to take a
look and I let them. They said that they
saw the object too, and that they could
see it very faintly in the smaller tel-
escope. The object could not be seen
without the help of the telescope. The
first time I lost it the larger telescope
was moved by one of the observers. But
I got it back for a few more seconds
when a large cloud came in front
of the moon. It was about 3 minutes
before the cloud disappeared and we
could see the moon again but the object
was nowhere in sight of the telescope.
We looked for it in the sky but
could not find it. We do not know
what happen to it. I am greatly interest-
ed in the subject of U.F.O's.

Yours truly,

[Note: There is a handwritten note at the bottom of the page that is partially cut off, which reads:
"There were no stars visible at
this time only one planet. The plar-
et jupiter that we seen,"]
