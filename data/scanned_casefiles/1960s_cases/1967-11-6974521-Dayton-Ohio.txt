6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:

At about 9:35 P.M. 11-23-67 I noticed
object coming from southerly portion of sky.
Observed object for about 35 to 40min.

Relatively thing that caused me to well
over the fact that about 30 sec. before
object disappeared it dropped somewhat that
looked like we spoke.

Aluminum at first report I saw that the
object was going fort & was fairly high.
The reason why I change my statement is
because the object that first seemed to
come down straight & if the main object
that had been traveling at some high rate of
speed this would not happened fuel.

City. AF

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
One

10. CONCLUSION
Very Probable (HOT AIR BALLOON)
At 2100 hrs the wind was blowing from 190 deg or approx about 4 knots. This is consistent with the flight as observed by some observers. The description is just like that of a balloon.

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
4 to 5 minutes

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted a bright luminous object that was described by some as circular and some as a spot or thread. The object traveled roughly NW. One said the light "appeared to be carried by a balloon or parachute". Before it disappeared it appeared to drop several fiery pieces toward the earth. The observation was made by two independent groups.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted a bright star-like object that was going from east to west.

CONTENTS: One Form 117 from the observer indicated that he saw the object at 1810 hrs. On 26 Nov., however, on a report was received from the observer listing the sighting as 26 Dec 67. Since this date is impossible it is assumed that both forms are on the one sightings. The time is listed as 2110 on the second form. The observers description is consistent with that of numerous aircraft that are in the Dayton area.
