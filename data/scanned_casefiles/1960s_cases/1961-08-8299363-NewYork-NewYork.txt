10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Received letter from ... observer while examining pictures.
11. COMMENTS STD photo-analysis examined prints and negatives and concluded that the alleged objets were caused by poor photo processing. They were not observed directly. There have been several photographs submitted for analysis which are suppossedly showing objects, but these have been inconclusive. Objects observed until after film processing, object blurred or scratched, or foreign material adhering to emulsion during processing.

SUBJECT: Request for Photo Analysis

TO: TD-Dis

1. It is requested that an analysis be made of the attached photographic prints to determine the nature of the objects.
2. It is requested that the negative and print be forwarded to
TD-D for analysis in order that they may be re-turned to the
witnesses.

1. The photographic prints and negatives have been examined,
with the following results:
a. Photo Nr. 1: the image marked as a sea gull is a break
or scratch in the negative emulsion while the other objects are
the natural cry-stization patterns in the film's process.
b. Photos 2 and 3: the white objects indicated by arrows
are real images and the smatlion destruction at the time of processing.
c. Photo Nr. 4: on this photograph the white images are
sharply while the dark areas of the photograph is out of focus. No
corresponding images can be seen on the negative; and the white
objects may have been produced by the gaseous emission of foreign matter
in the film.
2. The unidentified objects are the result of poor quality
photo development.

Analysis of Photos and Negatives

In BEAT (BEATTY) - 2 File Case
The photographic prints and negatives attached hereto have been examined.

In the photos 14 all the basic data on 14 shots of a bright circular object in the sky are given. The object appears to be self-luminous and smaller than the full moon. The object was stationary for a period of about 10-15 minutes and then moved off at a high speed toward the southwest. The photos were taken with a hand-held 35mm camera.

The BEAT (BEATTY) photos provide additional validation of the eyewitness testimony by showing a bright circular object that was observed and photographed. The two positive prints and one negative have been retained as a permanent record.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Dear sir:
Your investigation of our sighting of August 18 - 19 at 10:00 p.m. while camping on the Stokes State Forest, Sussex County, indicates the possibility of the flight path not being visible to ground observation, due to unusual atmospheric conditions affecting the perception of the observers. It may not be of scientific interest but is worthy of record as it illustrates the difficulties involved in adequate ground observation of such phenomena. Only under the most favorable atmospheric conditions would it have been possible to determine the true nature of the object or its point of origin or termination.

Yours truly,
