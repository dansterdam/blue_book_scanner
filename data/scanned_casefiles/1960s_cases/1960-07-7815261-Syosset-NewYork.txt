       The Pentagon
       Washington 25, D. C.

SUBJECT:   Observation of an Unusual Flight

1.   On the evening of Saturday, 16 July 1960, at about 2300 hours, my wife was lying on a cot on the patio of our home at Syosset, New York. It was a beautiful, clear evening. A multitude of stars were visible. While observing the stars she noticed two strange objects streaking across the sky in a northerly direction. At first she thought they might be "falling stars" but realized this was not so, when she observed that the course of these objects was not regular.

2.   I was in the house at the time and she called to me. I obtained a glimpse of these objects and then for some minutes (approximately five or ten) I scanned the sky. Then I observed two objects at what appeared a great height, streaking across the sky in a southerly direction. I pointed these out to my wife, and we both watched as these objects a slightly varied or a vealtually course, approximately in a southerly direction, then, somewhat abruptly changed their course to a westerly direction.

3.   No sound was made, these objects appeared to be at a great height, and they emitted a reddish-orange light.

4.   In discussing this phenomena with an acquaintance, he informed me that one of his neighbors, a former officer who I believe resides at Syosset, Air Force, had observed four of these objects in one flight on the same evening that my wife and I had observed the phenomena outlined above.

5.   In view of the interest of the Air Force in observations of this kind, I have written this account so that you may evaluate it and compare it with other reports you may have received.

Dear [redacted]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 August 1960 concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects by you and your wife on 16 July.

Your letter did not contain sufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I ask that you each complete the enclosed questionnaire independently and forward them to the Commander, Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,
