4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Three
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Varied
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: Varied
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Astro(S/P) Satellite (Echo I)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched three objects in the sky for several hours and thirty minutes. The objects moved in a triangle pattern except in a square pattern.

Observers compared the objects to stars, but they were flashing.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch shows a circular or elliptical object with some details inside it, such as what appears to be a window or opening. An arrow is drawn beside the object to indicate the direction of its movement.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It was hovering and then seemed to vanish.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
YES   NO   (Circle One): NO

16. Did the object move in front of anything at any time, particularly a cloud? 
YES   NO   (Circle One): NO

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Rattling, humming, buzzing sound
b. Color: White, or maybe a dull gray. Didn't seem too distinct.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
A match would have covered most of the object in the sky.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
