11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched three objects in the sky for up to three hours and thirty minutes. The objects were not moving except in a square pattern. The main body of the objects was flashing various colors. One object moved across the sky from the SW to the NE. It had a 25 foot trail of blue light and exhaust. Observers reported hearing whistling, humming, and buzzing sounds during the observation. Observers compared the objects to stars, but the objects were flashing.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Saturn, Altair, Deneb, and Vega were in the western sky during the observation period. Echo I was passing over 78N-45N at 0500½ heading toward the NE.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Not knowing or about toward earth

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what
Ground or something

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Whistling, humming, buzzing, combination
b. Color - White, turned to blue, it had green, back to white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and not much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 1/4 to 1/2 digit in sky

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
Was not moving shape in a square pattern

[The page includes a hand-drawn sketch with notes about the object's shape and movement]

27. In the following sketch, Imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF There was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The page contains a compass rose, a curved line with angle measurements from 0° to 90°, and several hand-drawn diagrams illustrating the movement and positioning of objects.
