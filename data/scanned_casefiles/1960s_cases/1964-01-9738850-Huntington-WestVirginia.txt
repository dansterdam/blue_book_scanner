SATELLITE
Only Echo schedules are retained. Sighting was not of Echo I or II. Probably one of the other visible Satellites.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer was looking through a window when he observed the object. It flickered just like a twinkling star on a clear night. It traveled about 30 degrees on the horizon, moving in a direction a few degrees N of E. It disappeared as though the light had been turned off.

Dear Mr.

The observations you made in January 1964 are similar to many reports of satellites received by the Air Force. Satellite schedules are not retained beyond one year, making identification of a specific satellite impossible at this location.

We are attaching a brochure describing the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

U. F. O. Reports,
Wright-Patterson A. F. B.,
Gentlemen:

The two letters enclosed concern two sightings made a year ago last month. Illness— and quite a few other things— intervened so I am sending them in now only for the record.

This sighting was made Sunday morning between 12 minutes of 6 am and 9½ minutes of 6 am, January 19, 1964. The U. F. O. was about 50° above the horizon traveling in a straight line to an east by north position when it disappeared.

The U. F. O. was visible as a point of light, like a star. Classifying the morning star as No. 1 in size, brilliance and visibility would give the U. F. O. a rank of No. 3. The light it gave off pulsed or flickered just like the twinkling of a star on a clear, cool night.

When I saw it, it was moving from a westerly direction (point A). It traveled about 30° on the horizon, moving down and in a direction a few degrees north of east. It then disappeared as though the light had been turned off (point B). It did not fade out in the haze or go behind a cloud but simply vanished.

TOTAL OBSERVATION TIME: 2½ MINUTES.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, A NUMBER OF STARS, NO MOON, NO CLOUDS, THE BLANKET OF HAZE THAT USUALLY HANGS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.

OBSERVATION POINT: [REDACTED]

NOTE: THIS U. F. O. WAS VISIBLE ONLY AS A POINT OF LIGHT, IT DID PULSE BUT DID NOT BRIGHTEN IN COURSE OF ITS FLIGHT.

SINCERELY,
[REDACTED]
HUNTINGTON 1, W. VA.

U. F. O. REPORTS,
WRIGHT-PATTERSON A. F. B.,
GENTLEMEN:

THIS SIGHTING WAS MADE WEDNESDAY MORNING BETWEEN 6 MINUTES OF 5AM AND 6½ MINUTES OF 5AM, JANUARY 29, 1964. THE U. F. O. WAS NEAREST A STAR—OR PLANET—ABOUT 45° ABOVE THE HORIZON, EAST AND NORTH OF HUNTINGTON, W. VA.

THIS STAR—OR PLANET—I WILL REFER TO IT AS A STAR, IS NOT KNOWN TO ME, BUT IT MAY BE IDENTIFIED AS FOLLOWS: IT RISES DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ABOUT MIDWAY AROUND THE HORIZON BETWEEN EAST AND NORTH ALMOST EXACTLY UNDER THE POSITION OF THE BIG DIPPER IN DECEMBER AND VERY EARLY JANUARY. IT IS A RAPID TRAVELER, REACHES ABOUT 45° ABOVE THE HORIZON BETWEEN 4:30 AND 5 AM, APPROACHES ITS ZENITH AND FADES OUT AT DAWN, RATING THE MORNING STAR AS NO. 1 IN SIZE, BRILLIANCE AND VISIBILITY. THIS STAR RANKS AS ABOUT NO. 3.

THE U. F. O. WAS VISIBLE AS A POINT OF LIGHT, RANKED AS A POOR NO. 4 OR NO. 5 IN SIZE, BRILLIANCE AND VISIBILITY NEXT TO THE STAR I USE AS A LOCATER POINT. THE U. F. O. WAS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE AND NORTH OF THE LOCATER STAR. WHEN I SPOTTED IT, IT WAS MOTIONLESS AT POINT B. THEN IT PLUNGED DOWN IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION, PASSED THE STAR, ZIG-ZAGGED TWICE IN FLIGHT ALONG LINE C AND THEN VANISHED AT POINT D AS IN THE DIAGRAM.


- page 7 -

THE U. F. O. COVERED ABOUT 25° ON THE HORIZON IN ITS PLUNGE DOWN PATH C

NOTE: THIS U. F. O. WAS A DIFFICULT ONE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE OF ITS SPEED AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT AS BRIGHT AS MY THREE PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS. IT DID PULSE BUT DID NOT BRIGHTEN TO DENOTE INCREASED SPEED. ITS ZIG-ZAGS WERE LITERALLY AT RIGHT ANGLES AND SO FAST THAT I LOST IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AT EACH TURN. IT DID NOT FOLLOW AN ERRATIC COURSE BUT MAINTAINED THE SAME DIRECTION AND DID NOT FADE OUT IN THE HAZE BUT JUST VANISHED, AS DID U. F. O. NO. 3.

OBSERVATION TIME: ABOUT 1½ MINUTES.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, FULL MOON, SOME STARS, NO CLOUDS, THE USUAL HAZE THAT HANGS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.

OBSERVATION POINT: AN EAST WINDOW, [REDACTED] NORTH-EAST

SECTOR OF HUNTINGTON, W. VA.

SINCERELY,

[SIGNATURE REDACTED]
HUNTINGTON, W. VA.

P.S.
GENTLEMEN:

THE ENCLOSED ARTICLE IS ALL I HAVE FROM THE LOCAL PAPERS ABOUT THE UPROAR IN VIRGINIA. TWO IDEAS OCCURRED TO ME AS A RESULT. ONCE YOU HAVE NOTED THAT ALL MY SIGHTINGS WERE MADE DUE LAST OF HUNTINGTON, W. VA. IN A GENERAL LINE LAST THRU CHARLESTON, WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS AND INTO VIRGINIA TERRITORY WHERE YOU ARE NOW HAVING A SLIGHT BEDLAM. THE VIRGINIA SIGHTINGS ARE COMING ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY SECOND SIGHTINGS AND MY SECOND PAIR TOOK PLACE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY FIRST SIGHTINGS.

IT STRIKES ME THAT A NEW FACTOR HAS ENTERED THE PICTURE. YOU RECALL FROM THE KEY-DE WRITINGS THAT HE MENTIONS TWO MAJOR PERIODS OF SAUCER ACTIVITIES; WORLD WAR II AND THE ATOM BOMB PERIOD INCLUDING THE POST-WAR EXPERIMENTS.

THE FACTOR INFLUENCING THE SAUCER VISITS WAS— WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE.

NOW IT SEEMS WE HAVE A NEW ELEMENT ENTERING THE PICTURE, THAT IS, THE DECISIONS OF THE SAUCER PEOPLE THEMSELVES. I HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY MAY HAVE AN IMPROVED SAUCER AND ARE ABLE TO PIN-POINT OBSERVATIONS— IN THIS CASE, VA. & W. VA. TERRITORY. THE PROXIMITY AND POSITION OF THE SAUCER HOME BASE, SPEED AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, MAY ALLOW SCHEDULED OBSERVATIONS IN ONE YEAR CYCLES INSTEAD OF MASSED OBSERVATIONS AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS.

P.P.S.

ARE OUR SATELLITES CARRYING ANYTHING LIKE TELE-PHO TO EQUIPMENT TO MAKE AND TRANSMIT PICTURES OF ANY ONE EXAMINING THEM WHILE THEY ARE OPERATIONAL IN SPACE?
