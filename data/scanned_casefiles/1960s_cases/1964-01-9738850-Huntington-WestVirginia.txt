Dear Mr. _________,

The observations you made in January 1964 about reports of satellites received by the Air Force are similar to schedules are not retained beyond one year, making identification of a specific satellite impossible at this location.

We are investigating a breakdown in the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.

U. F. O. REPORTS,
WRIGHT-PATTERSON A. F. B.
GENTLEMEN:

THE TWO LETTERS ENCLOSED CONCERN TWO SIGHTINGS MADE A YEAR AGO LAST MONTH. - ILLNESS - AND QUITE A FEW OTHER THINGS - INTERVENED SO I AM SENDING THEM IN NOW ONLY FOR THE RECORD.

THIS SIGHTING WAS MADE SUNDAY MORNING BETWEEN 12 MINUTES OF 6 AM AND 9:15 MINUTES OF 6 AM, JANUARY 19, 1964. THE U. F. O. WAS ABOUT 50° ABOVE THE HORIZON TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO AN EAST BY NORTH POSITION WHEN IT DISAPPEARED.

THE U. F. O. WAS VISIBLE AS A POINT OF LIGHT, LIKE A STAR. CLASSIFYING THE MOVING STAR AS 1 IN SIZE, BRILLIANCE AND VISIBILITY WOULD GIVE THE U. F. O. A RANK OF NO. 3. THE LIGHT IT GAVE OFF PULSED OR FLICKERED JUST LIKE THE TWINKLING OF A STAR ON A CLEAR, COOL NIGHT.

WHEN I SAW IT, IT WAS MOVING FROM A WESTERLY DIRECTION (POINT A). IT TRAVELED ABOUT 50° ON THE HORIZON, MOVING DOWN AND IN A DIRECTION A FEW DEGREES NORTH OF EAST. IT THEN DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH THE LIGHT HAD BEEN TURNED OFF (POINT B). IT DID NOT FADE OUT IN THE HAZE OR GO BEHIND A CLOUD BUT SIMPLY VANISHED.

TOTAL OBSERVATION TIME: 2% MINUTES.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, A NUMBER OF STARS, NO MOON, NO CLOUDS.

Dear Sir:

The observations you made in January 1964 are similar to many reports of satellites received by the Air Force. Satellites scheduled for launch during this period were visible one time as this document indicates they would be.

We are attaching a brochure describing the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

U. S. O. REPORTS

WRIGHT-PATTERSON A. F. B.,
OHIO
FEBRUARY 25, 1964

THIS SIGHTING WAS MADE WEDNESDAY DURING BETWEEN 5 MINUTES OF 5AM AND 5 MINUTES OF 5:30AM, JANUARY 29, 1964. THE U. F. O. WAS NEAREST A STAR--OR PLANET--ABOUT 45° ABOVE THE HORIZON, EAST AND NORTH OF HUNTINGTON, W. VA.

THIS STAR--OR PLANET--I WILL REFER TO IT AS A STAR, IS NOT KNOWN TO ME, BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PLANET. THE OBSERVATION TOOK PLACE DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ABOUT MIDWAY AROUND THE HORIZON BETWEEN EAST AND NORTH ALMOST EXACTLY UNDER THE POSITION OF THE BIG DIPPER IN DECEMBER AND VERY EARLY JANUARY. IT IS A RAPID TRAVELER, REACHING ABOUT 45° ABOVE THE HORIZON BETWEEN 4:30 AND 5 A.M, APPROACHES ITS ZENITH AND FADES OUT AT DAWN. RATING THE MORNING STAR AS NO. 1 IN SIZE, BRILLIANCE AND VISIBILITY, THIS STAR RANKS AS ABOUT NO. 3.

THE U. F. O. WAS VISIBLE AS A POINT OF LIGHT, FLASHING AS A PULSING OR C.P.S. IN SIZE, BRILLIANCE AND VISIBILITY NEXT TO THE STAR I USE AS A LOCATER POINT. THE U. F. O. WAS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE AND NORTH OF THE LOCATER STAR. WHEN I SPOTTED IT, IT WAS MOTIONLESS AT POINT D. THEN IT PLUNGED DOWN IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION, PASSED THE STAR, ZIG-ZAGGED TWICE IN FLIGHT ALONG LINE G AND THEN VANISHED AT POINT E AS IN THE DIAGRAM.

The U.F.O. COVERED ABOUT 25° ON THE HORIZON IN ITS PLUNGE DOWN PATH C FROM POSITION B TO D. 
NOTE THIS U.F.O. WAS A DIFFICULT ONE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE OF ITS SPEED AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT AS BRIGHT AS MY THREE PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS. IT DID PULSE OUT AND DID NOT COME TO A COMPLETE STOP, IT JUST SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN. IT LITERALLY AT RIGHT ANGLES AND SO FAST THAT I LOST IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AT EACH TURN. IT DID NOT FOLLOW AN ERRATIC COURSE BUT MAINTAINED THE SAME DIRECTION AND DID NOT FADE OUT IN THE HAZE BUT JUST VANISHED, AS DID U. F. O.
NO. D. OBSERVATION TIME ABOUT 1 1/2 MINUTES.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, FULL MOON, SOME STARS, NO CLOUDS. THE USUAL HAZE THAT HANGS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.
OBSERVATION POINT: AN EAST WINDOW SECTION OF HUNTINGTON, W. VA.

THE ENCLOSED ARTICLE IS ALL I HAVE FROM THE LOCAL PAPERS ABOUT THE OBJECT IN VIRGINIA. TWO SOAS OCCURRED TO ME AS A RESULT. SINCE YOU HAVE NOTED THAT ALL MY SIGHTINGS WERE MADE OUT LAST OF HUNTINGTON, MY WAS IN A GENERAL LINE LAST THRU CHARLESTON, WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS AND INTO VIRGINIA TERRITORY WHERE YOU NOW HAVING A SLIGHT SECLAM. THE VIRGINIA SIGHTINGS ARE COMING ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY SECOND SIGHTINGS AND MY SECOND PAIR THIS PLACE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY FIRST SIGHTINGS. 

IT STRIKES ME THAT A NEW FACTOR HAS ENTERED THE PICTURE. YOU RECALL FROM THE KEVENS WRITING THAT HE MENTIONS TWO MAJOR PERIOD OF SAUCER ACTIVITIES: WORLD WAR II AND THE ATOM BOMB PERIOD INCLUDING THE POST-WAR EXPERIMENTS. 

THE FACTOR INFLUENCING THE SAUCER VISITS WAS--- WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE--- NOW IT SEEMS WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ENTERED THIS PICTURE. THAT IS THE DECISIONS OF THE SAUCER PEOPLE THEMSELVES. I HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY MAY HAVE AN IMPROVED SAUCER AND ARE ABLE TO PINPOINT OBSERVATIONS--- IN THIS CASE, VA. & W. VA. TERRITORY. THE PROXIMITY AND POSITION OF THE SAUCER HOME BASE, SPEED AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, MAY ALLOW SCHEDULED OBSERVATIONS IN ONE YEAR CYCLES INSTEAD OF RANDOM OBSERVATIONS AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS.

P.S.---
ARE OUR SATELLITES CARRYING ANYTHING LIKE THE TELE-PHOTO EQUIPMENT TO MAKE AND TRANSMIT PICTURES OF ANY ONE EXAMINING THEM WHILE THEY ARE OPERATIONAL IN SPACE?
