10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
    Unusual object observed at an altitude of approximately 800 feet about 1 mile away, observed by airmen using ground radar. Object described as bright orange-red light, pulsating at irregular intervals, moving in erratic flight patterns. Object disappeared from radar scope after about 15 minutes.
11. COMMENTS: The sighting was apparently of an unusual aerial object, which could not be identified. While the object was observed on ground radar, no visual sightings were made. This contributed to the difficulty in identification. However, the object's unusual flight characteristics and the fact that it disappeared from radar could not be explained satisfactorily, and thus it remains unidentified.
