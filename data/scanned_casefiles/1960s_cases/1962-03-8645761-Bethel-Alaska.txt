9. COURSE: Obj was reported to be flat, real and had no known pattern

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Obj described as semi-circular, laying on flat side, size of dime at arm's length on observed sky surface in Bethel, Alaska. Obj was reported to be within 10 mi and had no known pattern in sight.

11. COMMENTS: The waxing moon, whose ex at time of sighting coincides with that reported for obj, was setting. Moon was 35% illuminated with illuminated portion generally on the bottom. Probably Leo contributed to sighting, but major cause for misidentification was distortion of moon due to atmospheric refraction. Dispersion caused reddish color. Time of critical moment was 12hrs 52m and lighting occurred at 12hrs 7m. Concluded that sighting was due to misidentification of setting moon due to distortions by atmosphere.

Below the horizon. The observer did not see the object disappear as the was hurrying to a radar tower to get a better vantage point, and while he was climbing up the inside of the tower, the object re-appeared. U. S. Weather Bureau unofficially estimates moon-set at 12/124352, but this officer was unable to determine azimuth and time of moonset, as no air almanac was available.
