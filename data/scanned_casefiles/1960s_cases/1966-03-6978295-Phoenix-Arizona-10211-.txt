Text from the document:

REPORT OF INVESTIGATIONS
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

REPORT NO.: 10211
DATE: 6 MARCH 1966 
LOCATION: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

REPORTING OFFICER: WILLIAM H. WILSON

On 3 March 1966, at approximately 1805 hrs, this investigator responded to a report of unidentified objects sighted over Phoenix, Arizona. Upon arrival at the scene, it was learned that the objects had been viewed by several witnesses from various locations in the Phoenix metropolitan area. 

Interviews with the witnesses disclosed the following information:
At approximately 1730 hrs, numerous bright lights, described as glowing and pulsating, were observed in the night sky to the southwest of Phoenix. The objects were reported to be stationary and at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet. After an unspecified period of time, the objects began to move in a southerly direction, maintaining their stationary posture. No sound was reported by the witnesses.

Photographic evidence in the form of 8mm movie film was obtained during the incident by a local resident. The film is currently being processed and analyzed by the United States Air Force.

This investigator was unable to determine the origin or nature of the unidentified objects. The case is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation and study.
