Sir:

While working in my field last spring, and again a few days ago, I found some strips of tin foil scattered over my field. I have been wondering if they had any significance, and how they got there, and what they were used for.

If you thought they were of any importance, I would be happy to send you some.

Thanking you, I am,

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]
