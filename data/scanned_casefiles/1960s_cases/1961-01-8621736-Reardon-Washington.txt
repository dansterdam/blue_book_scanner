1. Reference your message AFCIN-452X 1-725, 24 January 1961, subject same as above.

2. All persons who witnessed the UFO were given a questionnaire to answer. Most of these people work different shifts with Convair, therefore, it has taken several days to get the questionnaires all answered.

3. No sightings have been reported since 13 and 14 January 1961. The ceiling on the nights in question was 4000 feet overcast with a few scattered clouds in the area. This was observation at Fairchild Air Force Base weather station. Reardan, Washington, is about 23 miles to the west of the station.

REARDON; WASHINGTON, UFO SIGHTING OF 13 & 14 JAN. 1961

Several people reported seeing bright lights in the sky, in the vicinity of a Nike Site. One witness reported that, after observation, the light that he saw was a star. Most of the other witnesses described the action of the lights were similar to those on a Helicopter. One witness stated that the lights were identical to those on a helicopter. An exhaustive investigation was made by the reporting agency, and it was determined that a privately owned helicopter, with a red and white beacon fore and aft, was flying in the vicinity of Washington on the 14 and 15 of January 61.

This lighting arrangement is not a standard arrangement. The owner installed the lights to suit his needs, and as a result this lighting arrangement is not familiar to most people.

It is therefore concluded that the lights observed by the witnesses were those on this helicopter.

3. When the objects were closest to the witnesses, how close were the objects to the ground?
   100 ft. off ground.

4. Estimate the distance from witnesses to objects when objects were closest to the ground?
   100 yds.

5. Did the objects pass between witnesses and some other object such as a pole, tree, etc.?
   Passed over trees and appeared to descend about a quarter of a mile away to the South of gate house.

6. Over how large an area of the sky did the objects maneuver?
   Over an area of a half mile. At this time light was red and square, but what ever it was it had no outline.

7. What was the fastest and slowest rate of movement?
   When last seen from gate house it traveled toward the West and seemed to move as a helicopter might move across the sky. Hard to say as to speed.


- page 29 -

8. Did the path of movement have an effect on the color of the object?
No.

9. How long was each object in sight?
First time about five minutes. Second time about five minutes.

10. Did the objects seen on 14 January have the same characteristics previously as those seen on 13 January?
Didn't see on the 13th.

11. Give a detailed account of each object's maneuvers.
Going out to gate house the object seemed to have a white light like a search light. I went in to the gate house and told guard and he said "that it was the object. I said, 'I just saw it'". I went back out and at that time object had landed to the south of gate, maybe a half mile or so away. Later saw object or what appeared to be a helicopter to the east. No detail or outline.

12. What was the ceiling height on 13 January?
It was dark, had been raining, but lights were quite visible.


- page 30 -

14. Did you attempt to photograph the sighting?

No.

15. Were the sightings all made from the confines of the missile sites?

Outside of gate about 15 to 25 feet.

15. How far from another witness were you?

There were five or six of us watching the lights within three or four feet of each other.

16. List any other information pertaining to the sightings.

None.

17. Suppose you were able to place an object in the sky at approximately the same position as the lights that you saw. What type of an object would you use to simulate the lights?

First time I saw it it looked like a search light.
Second time I saw it it looked like a Helicopter.

AGE: 21                 Serial Number (Military Only):

1. How bright were the objects at their brightest?
   Quite Bright

2. Did they cast shadows?
   No Shadows

3. When the objects were closest to the witnesses, how close were the objects to the ground?
   They were a fair distance away and I am not a good judge of distance. I would estimate 1500 to 2000 ft.

4. Estimate the distance from witnesses to objects when objects were closest to the ground.
   About 12 miles

5. Did the objects pass between witnesses and some other object such as a pole, tree, etc.?
   No.

6. Over how large an area of the sky did the objects maneuver?
   I saw them for only a short time before I lost track of them.

7. What was the fastest and slowest rate of movement?
   Speed was apparently constant and not exceedingly fast.

8. [Text is partially illegible]

No.

9. How long was each object in sight?
I saw them for only about thirty to fourty five seconds.

10. Did the objects seen on 14 January have the same characteristic movements as those seen on 13 January?
I saw them only on the thirtieth of January.

11. Give a detailed account of each objects maneuvers.
I spotted the red blinking lights low on the horizon. I did not see them for some time after the other witnesses had. At first I saw only one light, then there were three moving from West to East. I lost sight of them after about 30 seconds. They were red blinking lights that looked exactly like the beacon lights on an aircraft. I remember having the impression that they were helicopters. One of them seemed to change direction rather abruptly.

12. What was the ceiling height on 13 January?
I believe it was a fairly clear night.

I would guess about 5000 feet.


- page 40 -

13. Did you attempt to photograph the objects?

Yes but they were too far away and all I would have gotten was a light, so I did not activate the camera.

No.

From four feet to three quarters of a mile on one occasion.

On one occasion a triangular red light and round white light with no rays and no sound or silhouette. The red light was about five feet above the white light. Looked like a stick hanging in the air holding two lights.

On another occasion just a lantern flashlight hanging in the air with nothing around it, out with no rays emitting. It was white and very bright.

On another occasion like a large round board with a round fluorescent light attached to the bottom.
