REARDON, WASHINGTON UFO SIGHTING OF 13 & 14 JAN. 1961

Several people were observing strange lights in the sky. The lights were described as being similar to those observed during the previous flight of a helicopter. One witness stated that the lights were similar to flares. However, an investigation was made by the reporting agency, and it was determined that the lights were not from a helicopter, and it was determined that the lights were not flares. The lights were moving and it was determined that the lights were not standard aircraft lights or flares.

It is therefore concluded that the lights observed by the witnesses were not those of a helicopter or flares, and as a result this is considered an unidentified flying object sighting.

I saw them only on the thirteenth or January.

11. Give a detailed account of each objects movements. 
I spotted the red blinking lights low on the horizon. I did not see them for long time, about twenty to thirty seconds. Then they were three moving from west to east. I did not see any after that except the three that moved away. They seemed to change direction rather abruptly.

12. What was the ceiling height on 13 January?
I believe it was a fairly clear night.

The were the sightings all made from the confines of the aircraft slate?

Yes.

15. How far from sighter's airplane were they?

right next to me. 

16. List any other information pertaining to the sighting.

I have seen other lights out here that could very well have been an air craft. The object I saw moved and it wasn't an aircraft.

17. Suggest you were able to place an object in the air at the time and location that you saw what you saw. Would this information be of any definite value to the scientific world?

Star.

CASE XXXXX-XXX REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

THEY APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING OR HOVERING OVER THE AREA. THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 1,000 FEET IN THE AIR AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT TO THE WEST. THE INFORMANT COULD NOT ESTIMATE THE SPEED OR SIZE OF THE OBJECTS BUT STATED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE ROUND AND SEEMED TO BE GLOWING.

A CLOSE 'WATCH' WAS KEPT ON THE AREA BY MILITARY PERSONNEL AND CIVILIAN OBSERVERS FROM THAT TIME ON. NOTHING FURTHER WAS OBSERVED.

LITTLE AND RURAL AIL CARRIER, OTS, WASHINGTON, D.C., GAVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 

MEANDAMS, WASHINGTON, FEELS FULLY QUALIFIED TO EVALUATE UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA AND HAS OBSERVED MANY STRANGE OBJECTS IN THE SKY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF WELL QUALIFIED TO OBSERVE AND EVALUATE UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA. 

SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST, WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING, HE HAS OBSERVED UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECTS WHICH HE CONSIDERS TO BE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. HIS OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE, BOTH ALONE AND WITH OTHER RELIABLE WITNESSES, AND HE CONSIDERS THE OBJECTS OBSERVED TO BE REAL, AND NOT FIGMENTS OF THE IMAGINATION.
