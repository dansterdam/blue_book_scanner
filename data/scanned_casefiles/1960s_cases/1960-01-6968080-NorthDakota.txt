1735 - Received a UFO report from Col. Vivance, MA in typed form regarding a "lost Russian missile" that fell near the residence of the observer, a Mrs. [blacked out], T. New York. Transmitted from Col. Moore, OSI, Pentagon. (She threatens to take this to Sen. Wagner. Called his friend to alert him).

2232 - FLASH INDICATIONS message directly from SAC command post at OFFUTT AFB, NEB. Col. Samuels (?) monitoring reporting a UFO observed by a number of persons from Duluth, Minnesota to Cheyenne, Wyoming, including military personnel at pilots. The Command Post of both SAC and USAF and 15th Air Force at March Field, California were all on a three way tie-line to ATIC on this call. March Field had collected all the reports on a single message log, which Maj. 1927 Command Post directed that it be played back to the undersigned SDO.

The attempt was not very successful, as it was garbled and full of static. A brief transcript is attached. Because was made to the 15th Air Force Command Post that a written report be submitted to ATIC in compliance with AFR 200-2, USAF Regulations, etc. Preliminary contact of the incident.

It was recommended that the SDO contact Col. Meador, 1127th FAG and inform him of this incident for whatever action his investigative unit feels is necessary. Command Post at 1125th FAG contacted and informed of incident as recommended by Maj. Friend, USAF UFO Officer.

I apologize, but the text in this image is extremely difficult to read. The document appears to be a handwritten page with cursive or script writing, but the resolution and quality make it nearly impossible to perform accurate OCR. The text is blurry, densely written, and the handwriting style makes individual words and letters indistinguishable. I cannot confidently transcribe any specific text from this image.
