OAK LAWN, ILLINOIS

Dear Sir:

On the morning of April 9, 1964, I was on my way to school. The time was about 7:20. The sky was clear and cloudless.

As I looked to the southern sky I saw there a light object. The shape was more like oblong, not a straight line. It was not on a plane. But it was still, staying apparently in one point.

I was not the only witness. The duration was about 20 seconds. The object was visible, it did not disappear. I could see it was bright and somewhat dark.

DATE: 1 APRIL 1964
TIME: 7:20 A.M. CENTRAL
STATUS: OPEN CASE, CLEARED
DESCRIPTION OF LIGHT: OBLONG, VERY BRIGHT,
MOVING, EXTREME SLOW, NO SOUND, LEFT NO TRAIL
WITNESSES: ONE
DURATION OF LIGHT: ABOUT 20 SECONDS
SOURCE: CIVILIAN
AGE: THIRTEEN
LOCATION: HINSDALE, ILLINOIS
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: ONE
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND VISUAL
SOURCE: CIVILIAN INTERVIEW SOUTHWEST
3. ALTITUDE: UNKNOWN

PLEASE SEND ME INFORMATION ON U.F.O. PICTURES IF USED. WILL APPRECIATE IF RETURNED AS "FLYING SAUCERS"?

Here is the text from the document:

Could you possibly give me a small piece of info re: the U.F.O. reported at an early time we saw up 12:00 for a reflection little type. to make up for this really downright dull type from a well list of knowledge. Something I can work on under & live & learn.

I am only 13 years of age, but I am very interested in the UFO field & when & now-a-days settled and serious fiction write.

Within & even maybe for the telescope, you think it may be able to write articles on my downtown home and how them public like, as well as how the government for now seems to code, we don't see much.

Sincerely,

[The signature is blacked out]

April 21, 1964

Dear

This is in reply to your letter of April 11, 1964, in which you reported seeing an unusual object in the sky over Bridgeview, Illinois on April 9th, and expressing a desire to be a part of the project which investigates Unidentified Flying Objects.

We are unable to identify the object you observed from the information you have furnished. It may have been a weather balloon or an aircraft which caught the early morning sun and appeared as something unusual. Any number of familiar objects in the sky may appear to be unusual or different when viewed at early morning or late afternoon due to the fact that they catch the rays of the sun at a high altitude and seem to be shining very brightly.

There are no temporary positions available in connection with the UFO program. Project Blue Book, the official title of the Air Force Investigation of UFOs, is headed by an astrophysicist. He utilizes scientific facilities and personnel which include metallurgical specialists, astronomers, physicists, chemists, photo-interpreters, and even clinical psychologists. So you see, there are many fields of endeavor associated with this program which you should explore if you maintain your interest in this activity. There are no temporary positions available in connection with the UFO program.

Any college courses leading to a Science degree are recommended courses toward a future career in any of a number of interesting and vital Air Force activities. In turn, the Air Force is eager to interview honor students, and to utilize their outstanding ability. If, toward the completion of your college career, you are still interested in this vocation, you should contact the Air Force personnel office which will advise you further on the possibilities of a career such as you desire.

We are enclosing the new Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena which we think will be of interest to you.

OAK LAWN, ILL. 60455

Dear Sir:

On April 9th of the present year I reported a U.F.O. sighting and I would like to have more information.

Could you send me the Air Force Fact Sheet on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena?

Have you any copies of the Blue Book sheets from about 1952 or might the first one ever released be that of my sighting here?

Can my sighting of the U.F.O. departmental records on file? If the one in Chicago could I have the addenda to B2 (in the night of the 30, I had so excited a call from Chicago inquiring about my sighting.)

Could I have the addenda to our astronomer and physicists working in the U.F.C. department?
