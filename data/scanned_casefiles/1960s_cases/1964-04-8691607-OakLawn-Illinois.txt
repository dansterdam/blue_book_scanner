Dear Sirs,
I am 13 years old and very much interested in space. Enclosed, please send me some information on the latest project by the U.S.C. world; this is a popular request of mine. Some of these requests are a mere curiosity, and friendly, for a more serious interest in the science? It all must work out in some manner for many American minded men who might do not understand. I know many of the very common named, but I would like more information of a wide view of the subject. There may be a practical and scientific approach to this interest if handled. Yours very truly.

Oak Lawn, Illinois
Dear sir:
On the morning of April 8, 1964, at approximately 4:00 A.M., I was awakened by a bright light shining through my bedroom window. Upon looking out, I observed a very strange object hovering over my garage. This object was approximately 40 feet in diameter and seemed to be metallic in appearance. It had several lights on the underside, which were blinking in an irregular pattern.
The object hovered silently for approximately 30 seconds, then abruptly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in about two seconds. This whole incident lasted approximately one minute.
I am a 40 year old businessman and this is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this. I am quite certain that what I saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter further.
Sincerely yours,

Dear [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of April 11, in which you expressed a desire to be part of the project which involves a desire to be part of the project which involving sighting objects in the sky.

We are unable to identify the object you observed. It may have been a weather balloon or an aircraft which caught early morning sun and appeared as something unusual. Any number of familiar objects in the sky may appear quite different and difficult to identify when viewed at an early morning or late in the day high altitude and seem to be unidentified.

There are no temporary positions available in connection with the UFO project. Project Blue Book has a limited staff and facilities which includes metallurgists, astronomers, physicists, chemists, interpreters, and even clinicians and psychologists. We have many demands on our attention and without your interest in this activity, there are no openings.

Any college courses leading to a science degree, such as engineering or physics, and a number of interesting and vital Air Force activities in turn, the Air Force is eager to interview honors students and to utilize their outstanding ability. You should direct your interest in this vocation. The Air Force also provides facilities which are related to such desires.

Dear Sir:
On April 7th of the present year I reported all a 6:57 P.M. sighting, and I would like to have more information.

I am sorry that my report of the Blue Book about 1952 or more can not the first one ever since then, but the minor are too many to enumerate.
It was longer to obtain of the A.F.O. documents than one in Chicago â€“ could be have the address to $5 in the right of the report, so I should be pleased to acquire a complete sighting report.
Could you send you me this information, and apologizing in the A.F.O. departments.
