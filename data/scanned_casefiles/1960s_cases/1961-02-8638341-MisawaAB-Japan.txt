10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright light, aprox ten times as bright as star Sirius which was visible at time. Much larger than a star. Initially varied considerably. Momentary appeared to be N at a slow angular velocity. Color range was from pinkish white to reddish white.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft

☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical VENUS
☒ Probably Astronomical

☐ Unknown

11. COMMENTS
Obj was probably planet Venus. Venus at its brightest at this time and its direction was coincident with that reported for UFO at time of sighting. Atmospheric refraction probably contributed to sighting by distorting, coloring and giving apparent motion to planet. Fact that obj disappeared at time past sub statiates this conclusion.
