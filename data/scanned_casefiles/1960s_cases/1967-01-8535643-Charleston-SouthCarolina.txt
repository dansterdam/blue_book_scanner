MEMO for the Record:    23 Jan 67

Contact was made with Lt. Paul Jones, Ft Lee AFS, Virginia in regards to the submitted UFO report. The objects were only picked up on one height finder, although there were no others working at the time.

The object did not appear on search radar; however, only one height finder could have seen the object since the other search radars in the area were not set to pick up the object. The ground clutter around the area prevented picking up the object. Lt. Jones was asked if a UFO was painted on radar did they order aircraft into the air. He said that they had no policy to intercept UFOs. A C-123 aircraft was in the area at the time of the sighting however the pilot reported nothing out of the ordinary.

2 March 67

Lt. Paul Jones called to provide additional information in regards to the radar sighting. Lt. Jones was informed by the Charleston AFS, Charleston, S.C. that the radar paints were not of UFOs. A check of the equipment was made and it was learned that the individual monitoring the radar set had the Gain on the height finder turned up to the high position. This caused the appearance of a lot of interference on the radar scope. Personnel at Charleston AFS determined the paints on the radar to be this interference. The personnel turned the Gain on high again and picked up more UFOs. When the Gain was turned down the UFOs disappeared.
