The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes an alleged UFO sighting near Cape Canaveral, Florida and Cuba. According to the document, the UFO was observed to have a circular shape, the same magnitude as Venus or Echo 1, a white color, and no sound was heard. The observer was watching a gas cloud in association with a missile launch. The object had an azimuth of approximately 335 degrees and faded in intensity slowly, disappearing.

STATED DURING INTERVIEW THAT IN HER OPINION
THIS WAS WHAT SHE SAW. PART IV. IT IS THE PTD OPINION THAT THIS
MARINE WITNESSED OBSERVED THE MISSILE. THE DISTANCE OF
THEIR VANTAGE POINT FROM THE MISSILE, APPROXIMATELY 550 NAUTICAL
MILES, CAUSED IT TO APPEAR LOW ON THEIR HORIZON. THE MARINES
PROBABLY EXPERIENCED THIS IMPRESSION THAT THE MISSILE WAS CLOSER
THAN IT WAS DUE TO MISTAKING BRIGHTNESS FOR NEARNESS. PART V. THE
OBJECT VIEWED BY MR. 
AND MAJORS 
AND 
REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED DUE TO THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT DATA. UTILIZING
THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MR. 
AND ASSUMING AN ALTITUDE OF
70,000 FEET THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE A TRUE SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY
250 KNOTS. THESE PARAMETERS FALL WELL WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF
USSR RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER OTHER FACTORS TEND TO RULE
THIS OUT AS A POSSIBILITY. AT THE HOUR OF THE SIGHTING 0515 THE SUN
WAS TOO FAR BELOW THE HORIZON TO ILLUMINATE AN OBJECT AT 70,000
