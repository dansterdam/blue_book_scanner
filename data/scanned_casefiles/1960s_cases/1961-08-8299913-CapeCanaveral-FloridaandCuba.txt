AND INTERCEPT GROUND OPTICAL RECORDER (IGOR) FILMS OF TEST #5059
AND CORRELATION OF THE INFORMATION WITH TRAJECTORY DATA LED TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT MRS [REDACTED] AND S/SGT [REDACTED] OBSERVED SEPARATION
OF THE BOOSTER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE IONIZATION CLOUD FORMED BY
THE MISSILE. MRS [REDACTED] STATED DURING INTERVIEW THAT IN HER OPINION
THIS WAS WHAT SHE SAW. PART IV. IT IS THE FTD OPINION THAT THE
MARINE WITNESSES OBSERVED THE MISSILE ITSELF. THE DISTANCE OF
THEIR VANTAGE POINT FROM THE MISSILE, APPROXIMATELY 550 NAUTICAL
MILES, CAUSED IT TO APPEAR LOW ON THEIR HORIZON. THE MARINES
PROBABLY EXPERIENCED THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MISSILE WAS CLOSER
THAN IT WAS DUE TO MISTAKING BRIGHTNESS FOR NEARNESS. PART V. THE
OBJECT VIEWED BY MR [REDACTED] AND MAJORS [REDACTED] AND [REDACTED]
REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED DUE TO THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT DATA. UTILIZING
THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MR [REDACTED] AND ASSUMING AN ALTITUDE OF
70,000 FEET THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE A TRUE SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY
240 KNOTS. THESE PARAMETERS FALL [ILLEGIBLE] WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF
USSR RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER OTHER FACTORS TEND TO RULE
THIS OUT AS A POSSIBILITY. AT THE HOUR OF THE SIGHTING 0515 THE SUN
WAS TOO FAR BELOW THE HORIZON TO ILLUMINATE AN OBJECT AT 70,000
FEET. ALL RADAR UNITS IN THE AREA REPORTED NO TARGETS AT THE TIME
OF THE SIGHTING. THE TYPE RADAR EQUIPMENT LOCATED IN THE AREA
INCLUDES AN FPS-20, FPS-8, AND AN FPS-6. ALL POSSIBILITY OF THIS
OBJECT BEING ONE OF THE KNOWN ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES WAS RULED OUT

BY A COMPUTER CHECK OF TIME AND LOCATION AGAINST THE ENTIRE
FAMILY OF KNOWN SATELLITES. PART VI. IT IS THE FTD CONCLUSION
THAT THE SIGHTING WHICH OCCURRED AT AFMTC, 1015Z ON 23 AUGUST
1961 WAS PROBABLY DUE TO SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA. HOWEVER, THE
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW IDENTIFICATION OF
THE RESPONSIBLE PHENOMENA. IT IS FURTHER CONCLUDED THAT THIS
WAS NOT A COVERT ATTEMPT TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES
OF AFMTC AND MORE SPECIFICALLY TEST #5050.
