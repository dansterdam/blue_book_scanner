Here is the text from the document:

HE2X

Cincinnati, December 18, 1960

Department of the Air Force
Washington D. C.

Gentlemen,

May we draw your attention to the following event:

Today, Sunday afternoon, December 18, at 5:20, we sighted in the sky two strange objects, occurring in bright yellow lines, quite length about 1 feet.

They were moving in quite a distance from each other from South East to North East, parallel to horizon with a considerable high appand. The local direction was about Kentucky - Ohio - Indiana.

It was a clear, absolute cloudless sky and the bright red horizon after sunset affected this appearance.

We are sure, that these were UFO's, especially since we have paid the newest books about that flying saucers.

Yours sincerely

Cincinnati, Ohio

Cincinnati 2, Ohio
