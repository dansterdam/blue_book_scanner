The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a technical drawing depicting a sketch and compass used for describing the motion and elevation of an observed UFO object. The drawing includes a sketch of the horizon line and the object's path, as well as a compass rose indicating the object's bearing.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text-based information about an observation made in Castalia, Ohio on July 23, 1965.

CASTALIA, OHIO
23 JULY 1965

Observer was out, viewing Venus from approximately 2040 - 2100 EST as it was setting. Observer then began to observe other stars and planets in the sky. At 2115 as observer was viewing the astronomical bodies he suddenly saw a shining light. This object was moving in a SSE direction. The observer stated that the object was brighter than Venus but not as bright as Venus. 

The object made no noise at all during the observation. The object was first noted near the star Deneb and proceeded between Lyra and Vulpecula through Aquila to Sagittarius where it stopped, grew dimmer and disappeared suddenly.

The total time of the observation was approximately ten seconds.

COMMENTS
A logical explanation of the reported sighting would be a meteor, although the time factor is in excess of those normally reported for a meteor (5 - 8 seconds). Whether a trail or tail was visible was not reported, making such an explanation impossible. Considering the available information the case is being listed as unidentified.

Washington, 23/6/65.

Dear Sirs,

This case was reported to me on 25, 1959. Seemingly a lighted object was observed for some time over the village of Castalia, Ohio, on the evening of 25 July, 1958, under overcast sky conditions, around 9:30 p.m. EST. The lighted object was first noticed moving rapidly from east to west at an altitude estimai to be about 2000 ft. The object appeared circular in shape with a brilliant white light. When the object reached a point overhead, it stopped, hovered briefly, then reversed its direction of travel, moving slowly from west to east and finally disappearing from sight to the east. The duration of the observation was approximately 15 minutes. 

This office has been unable to identify a conventional explanation for the lighted object observed on this occasion. The report is forwarded for your information and any comments you may care to offer.

Thank you. 

Sincerely,

[Redacted]

Text extracted from the document:

Dear Sir,

On July 25, 1963 at about 10:20 P.M. I observed an unusual aircraft maneuvering in the sky. It was flying at a relatively low altitude and appeared to be silent. The craft was approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and had a glowing blue-white light. It seemed to be hovering or motionless for a period, then would suddenly dart or dash horizontally at a very high rate of speed. After some minutes of observation, the craft suddenly disappeared from view. I was somewhat puzzled by the nature of this observation and would appreciate any information you may be able to provide. I would be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
