11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a round shaped orange colored object fall to the ground. The object looked like a orange ball of flame with black smoke coming from it. The ball of flame fell to the ground as an aircraft circled overhead.

The description is consistent with that of a flare sighting. The aircraft circling overhead must have dropped some type of flare.
