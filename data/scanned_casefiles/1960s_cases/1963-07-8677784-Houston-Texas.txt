Dear Sirs,

I would like to know if you have any information on unidentified flying objects. Because sometimes at night some friends and I look up at the sky and we, when the sky is clear, can barely but distinctly see something in the air. I don't know what they are, planes or jets. If one thing for sure, they aren't planes at this time. If there is any information available send your reply to the address of the following.

Mr.
Houston 29, Texas

This information is very important to me and any thing that you have large or small will be a significant and appreciated.

Sincerely Yours,
Mr.
