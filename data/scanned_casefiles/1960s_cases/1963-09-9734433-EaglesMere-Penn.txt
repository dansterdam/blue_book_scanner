Dear Sirs:

It has been suggested that I write to you about my observations of an unusual satellite.

On Monday, September 23, 1963, between 9:50 and 9:55 P.M., E.D.T. I observed a bright object travelling from east to west at - high speed (i.e., high for such objects). My point of observation at this first sighting was a farm limited view. Realizing that this was unusual in both speed and direction, I estimated when I first saw it would have appeared and looked to the shore of the nearby lake where I had a clear view of virtually the entire southern sky. The object reappeared at about 10:20 a bit south of east and disappeared a bit north of west. It was apparently the same object in speed, path and brightness (it was the brightest: light in the sky except Jupiter). The same object (at least so all appearances) reappeared again at 10:52.

My location was Eagles Mere in north central Pennsylvania, a summer resort in the Alleghenies at 2000 ft. altitude. The night was cold and clear. This object has also witnessed by my wife the first time and by a friend the third time. There is no question in my mind that its path was east to west. (I am quite familiar with the compass directions here). I am an engineer, an ex-pilot and had nine years in Martin's engineering department and I examined the object through a hand held 10-power telescope) and that its appearance period (apparently orbital) was between 25 and 30 minutes.

Both the path and the apparent speed of this object are, to my knowledge, quite unusual. A Mr. William O'Donnell at NASA's Public Inquiry office suggested that you would be interested in this and might be able to enlighten me as to the object's identity - he could tell me nothing about it.

Sincerely,

ABM/mo

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAF-OL 3b (MRS GAISER)
WASH 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter from ____________ requesting information on an unidentified flying object. This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Since Mr. __________ believes that this object was not aircraft it is not possible to evaluate his sighting. ATI known satellites have an easterly inclination to their orbit at this latitude.

3. Since his letter contained all essential information, it is not necessary that Mr Houstle be sent an FTD Form 164.

Dear Mr.

This is in response to your letter of September 30, 1963, regarding your observations of an unusual satellite.

Our Foreign Technology Division has investigated your report, however, since you believe that the object was not aircraft, it is not possible to evaluate your sighting. All known satellites have an early indication to their orbit at this latitude. The closest point to Eagles Mere at which we can pinpoint the satellite Echo on the night of September 23rd is Scranton, at which time Echo appeared at 7:44 p.m. north of the city, 67 degrees above the horizon, moving southeast.

Thank you for reporting this observation to us. We are sorry that we cannot enlighten you further.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF

I apologize, but the image appears to be extremely faint and illegible. While there seems to be a structured document with rows and columns, I cannot confidently read any of the text or numbers on the page. The document looks like it might be a form or table, but the details are too blurry to discern.
