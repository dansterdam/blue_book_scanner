9. COURSE
NW-SSE

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object same size and color as a star, first seen 15-20° elevation at 297°. Last seen 15-30° elevation at 115°. Had straight steady course and disappeared behind a cloud bank both dates.

11. COMMENTS
This case does not present much information, but that which is presented gives strong indication that the objects viewed were probably meteors. The description and straight path being factors in support of this conclusion. The relatively long time in sight, however is out of line with this conclusion.
