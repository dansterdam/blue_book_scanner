Dear Gentlemen:

Here follows particulars concerning an object seen in the sky as I was parting every milk bottles outside my home door. It was seen in late August or early September, 1965, at about 9:30.

1. Upon the way the small lights were arranged around it, it appeared to be QUITE ROUND.

2. Had and white small lights all around it flickered on and off.

3. Two brilliantly lighted discs formed the face of it, placed side by side ... like an enormous pair of eyes. The discs were red, the center portion amber.

4. The light or color was steady.

5. No apparent sound.

6. Heading SOUTH; almost directly toward my home.

7. Low altitude; about there + helicopter might fly looking for power lines. And, at the same degree of speed as a helicopter.

8. When it was above the area between the two houses across the street, it turned, and went off in the same direction from where it came.
