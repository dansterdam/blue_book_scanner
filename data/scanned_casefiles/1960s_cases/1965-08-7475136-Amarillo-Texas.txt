1. Follow-up investigation failed to produce any relevant information.
The description of the formation sighted by Mrs. resembled that
of a flight of fighter aircraft engaged in night refueling operations
with KC-135 tanker. Neither Cannon AFB, New Mexico nor Holloman AFB,
New Mexico, flew refueling missions that night.

2. Mrs. has been very zealous in reporting her sightings of
various lights in the sky. Previously her statements had been somewhat
confused, however, on this occasion she had prepared a set of notes to
aid her in making her report. I believe that her enthusiasm may render
her somewhat less reliable than a casual observer would be.

3. Mrs. stated that she had devoted her evenings for most or
the week to watching for these lights. I am unable to establish any
well founded conclusions based on the evidence available.
