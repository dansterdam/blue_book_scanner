27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

B <- DISAPPEAR FOR A SECOND AND THEN ZERO OFF TO THE NORTH APPEAR

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

JUST 1

I WISH YOU COULD LET ME KNOW OF THE SKY AT THE TIME.

31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One)   Yes   No

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9th JULY 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

WE HAD JUST LEFT MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE WITH MY FATHER AND HE AND I JUST LOOK'D UP AT THE STARS FOR A FEW MOMENTS, AND I NOTICED THAT SEVERAL STARS SEEMED TO HAVE YELLOWISH OR REDDISH COLORS, AND WE NOTICED WHAT WE THOUGHT TO BE A PLANET IN THE WESTERN SKY NEAR THE HORIZON, BUT AS I WANT TO THIS, PROBABLY 15 MIN - 1/2 HR. LATER, I CAN'T SEE THE PLANET. WE HAD JUST BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS. SUDDENLY AS I WAS LOOKING HIGH IN THE SKY, QUITE VERTICAL I SAW SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SKY AND I STILL REMEMBER THAT I GOT THE ILLUSION I WAS SPINNING, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE AN ILLUSION, SOMETHING ABOUT THE OBJECT I JUST CONJURED UP. HOWEVER THAT MAY BE, IT WAS WHITE, AS NEAR AS I REMEMBER, AND LOOKED APPROXIMATELY LIKE AN AVERAGE STAR. THAT IS TO SAY, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MOVING, IT WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IT, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY MOVING AND IT WAS GOING MUCH FASTER THAN AIRCRAFT AS HIGH AS THIS SEEMED TO BE, SO IT WAS EITHER

P.S. I TRIED TO RECREATE THE ANGLE IN THE SKY BY LOOKING UP, AND WAGGING MY HAND SLOWLY TO CATCH THE OF A FLASH REFLECTING IN MY GLASSES, AS A SUGGESTION OF A THING IN THE SAME PLACE ABOUT 1/2 MIN LATER, SO APPEARED, CONCLUDED IT WAS NOT A REFLECTION IN MY G-

MUCH LOWER IN ALTITUDE THAN IT SEEMED
AT A VERY FIRST OBJECT, I DON'T LIKE
TO GIVE SPEED ESTIMATES BECAUSE I HAVE
NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW BIG IT ACTUALLY
WAS OR HOW FAR AWAY IT ACTUALLY WAS.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN AIRPLANE, BUT
USUALLY THEY HAVE NAVIGATION LIGHTS
AND THESE AT LEAST CIVILIAN PLANES
COME TO THINK OF IT. DON'T RECALL THE
LIGHTING ON MILITARY PLANES BUT I'D
IMAGINE, EXCEPT IN WARTIME PERHAPS
THEY'D BE THE SAME. WHEN I FIRST
SAW IT, I WAS ALMOST WILLING TO WRITE
IT OFF AS AN AIRPLANE OR A PIECE OF
JUNK (AN INTERMEDIATE ROCKET STAGE IN
ORBIT) BUT WHAT IT DID BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED
MADE ME WRITE THIS TO YOU. IT DISAPPEARED
E.G. I COULDN'T SEE IT THAN IT REAPPEARED
MUCH FASTER (SPEED COMPARABLE TOA METEOR
IN THE NORTH AND, IT SEEMED, IN A SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD
DIRECTION. IT WAS AN ABRUPT CHANGE OF COURSE
IN THE PART OF THE OBJECT AND THAT IS WHAT
MADE ME WRITE THIS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN
AIRPLANE, PROP. OR JET, I HAVE SUCH A SUDDEN
CHANGE OF DIRECTION OR SUCH ACCELERATION.

HOWEVER, I MUST QUALIFY THIS BY SAYING
I DO NOT HAVE BEEN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES IT MIGHT
NOT BE THE SAME WAY AND THEN SUDDENLY THE OBJECT I SAW
RETAIN A MEMORY OF THE FLASH, QUITE MOVING
AT THE END AND I STILL ONLY STATES A
I DEFINITELY SAW IT

At 9.15 P.M. the morning night of July 14, 14-17, I A.M. state located on Signal Beckman district at Steel Track Circle. It was going back toward the A.A.F. base. As I drove along about 4 mile from same walk, it came near the L.O. site, as I approached I saw an object about 30 feet in diameter, about 5 feet above the ground. It appeared to be still. This object had a yellow greenish halo glow. So I turned into the site area to investigate. As I got within around 100 feet of object it went straight up for about 40 or 50 feet and then headed straight down the same strip road, which is an access road for a people living in trailers on the base. I followed the object in my car for a distance of about one mile at a speed of about 26 miles an hour, run into canal so I stopped and got out of my car and watched this object as it continued right following along the coast line - at a time did not see any noise or smell any fumes.

MEMO FOR RECORD

TDACS
TIAO
TDA

On 13 July the Detroit News carried an article on an object which fall from the sky. The dimensions are as follows: 2' wide x 1 1/2' high x 2" thick, coloration white, red & black trim. One half of the item was window made of plexiglass surrounded by aluminum.

I called Selfridge AFB, Mt. Clemens, Michigan, and spoke to Major Ward, who is the OIG relative to UFO's. (38-55-11570-3115)

I relayed to him our interest in the object, and requested that he contact Mr. Ralph Riley (313-222-2162) of the Detroit News, who now has physical possession of the item, and do the following:

a. Secure or take photos of the item for shipment to us.
b. Ascertain the nature of the item.
c. Secure the item if it appeared to be foreign in nature.

On 24 July, I called Major Ward, and he said that an investigation was made on our behalf, and that the object was an escape hatch from a private airplane, probably of North American manufacture. Major Ward is sending us a copy of the photographs as info, and will contact the FAA in that area to lend his assistance in the case. These photos will be examined upon arrival and then sent to TDET/JF for their information.

On July 16, 1967 my cousin and I saw a U.F.O. At 11:10 p.m. I was looking out the window when I saw it. I told my cousin to look out the window while I got my glasses. When I looked out the window it was disappearing over the roof. Later in the week I asked one of my friends if he saw it and it exploded.

Verily, truly sig [signature appears to be blacked out]

Dear Sir

About two weeks ago my husband and I saw a phenomenon of some sort. It was during a lightning storm both times and I was there when there was no lightning, there was only one with each lightning storm and three on the other round. I was close say maybe 5 inch it was aglow. And could come back toward wind up to 45 mile an hour. Flew through thick flees also with ease. And when we spoke it came closer, this made my hair stand on

Proposed reply to letter from Barbara Csada, July 29, 1967 (Sighting Jul 1967)

Dear Mrs [redacted]

Reference your recent letter in which you reported your unidentified observations.

It would be extremely difficult to perform a comprehensive investigation based on your observation; you neglected to mention the time, date and location of your sightings. If you had reported your sighting to your nearest military installation (if your sighting occurred in the United States) at the time, our analysts and evaluators could have attempted to determine what you had observed. If we had been unable to find a logical answer, then your case would have been categorized as UNIDENTIFIED.

You did not mention whether your observation occurred in the United States or Canada. The United States Air Force lacks jurisdiction to investigate those sightings outside its continental limits. In the future, if you should observe another UFO, please contact your nearest military installation, for the local investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you and your husband. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 July 1967

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Mr. Hammack and Mr. Hammack decided it probably was a man-made satellite. But very definitely was not a star, nor a falling star. It seemed almost as far away as a star. It was a very white glowing object that moved swiftly and steadily across the heavens and was about 2 or 3 degrees high from the horizon. It was small, almost a camp site. It was not an airplane.

Mr. Hammack (35 yrs) and son Allen (13 yrs) said they saw a flare of light that left the white glowing object with what did not appear this but always the white lights flared out around it steadily.

Dear [redacted]

Reference your letter of July 11 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which you have been observing since December, 1966.

At this late date, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation into your earlier observations.

If you would like us to investigate your letter sightings on July 1 and 7, 1967, we will need additional information. Upon completion of the inclosed FTD Form 164, our analysts will undertake a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observation. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

July 11, 1967

Project Blue Book
U. S. A. F.
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sirs,

Since December, 1966, I have witnessed four objects which I feel warrant attention as possible U. F. O.'s.

My first sighting occurred on Friday, December 2, 1966. Around 11:00 P. M. I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a bright red and blinking light curving slowly from west to northwest. It was at a fairly low altitude. I don't feel qualified to estimate its size, but it was similar in appearance and slightly larger than the red light of a water tower about 1 to 2 miles from our house. However, the tower light is not visible from the patio where I was watching.

I observed the thing for about five minutes. It moved erratically. After turning from west to northwest it climbed and then it disappeared behind the houses behind our's. It apparently landed in a field between our house and the water tower.

waited another five minutes but it did not
reappear.
It was silent and did not resemble any
conventional aircraft that I have ever seen!
(Much aircraft passes over our house.) It
was an overcast night and no stars were visible. The object appeared intelligently
controlled.
No one was home but myself at the time
and then, I told my mother she only laughed.
A rash of U. F. O. sightings occurred in our
area shortly afterward.
Sometime last spring and again on July
4, 1967 at around 10:30 P. M. I witnessed
a similar on the same object apparently
landing in the same area as that of my first
sighting.
My last sighting occurred last Friday,
July 7, 1967 at around 10:30 P. M. It was
exactly like the others except that it was
either smaller or farther away. It was following the opposite course of my first sighting.
My mother saw it also and we watched it
for about five minutes. It was moving east.
We both noted that it moved erratically.
At first it moved at a moderate speed but

then sped up suddenly and disappeared in
the distance. It was a clear night and stars
were visible. This was not a star, meteor-
ite, etc.

All these sightings have much in common

All four were similar on the same ob-
ject.

All four were silent and did not resem-
ble conventional aircraft or heavenly
bodies, but did seem to be intelligent-
ly controlled.

With the exception of that last sight-
ing, all followed approximately the
same course at approximately the same
speed and all landed in approximately
the same spot.

The last sighting was following the
opposite course of the others (east
veering northeast) and appeared to be
either smaller or farther away.

All were sighted between 10:15 P.m.
and 11:15 P. m.

Dear

This is in reply to your correspondence on an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of July 7, 1967.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data, such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to the nearest military installation, an evaluation would have been possible. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,
