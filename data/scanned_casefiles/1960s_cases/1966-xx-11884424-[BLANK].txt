MEMO FOR RECORD                                                                 20 April 1966

SUBJECT: Implementing SAB Ad Hoc Committee on Project Blue Book Recommendations

1. The following personnel met at 1400 on 19 April in Room 5D1014 to discuss how best to implement the recommendations made by the SAB Ad Hoc Committee to review Project Blue Book.

Dr. Brian O'Brien                         Colonel Robert Burke, AFBSA
Dr. Jesse Oriansky                        Lt Col Harold Steele, AFBSA
Lt Col Robert Hippler, AFRTSA             Mrs. Sara Hunt, SAOF

2. On 5 April 1966, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown, in a memorandum to the Chief of Staff, stated that the Committee's recommendations should be accepted and arrangements made for a (sic) scientific team to investigate in depth certain selected sightings of UFOs. General Ferguson was given responsibility for implementing the Committee's recommendations and Lt Colonel Hippler is project officer.

3. Although the Committee's recommendation was clear and succinct, initially there was no unanimous agreement on how to put this recommendation into effect. A basic question is:

(1) Should the contract be with a university or should it be with individuals connected with a university? A great deal of the meeting was taken up discussing these facts of the problem and a clear answer did not evolve. Therefore, it is probable that I, and perhaps some selected members of the Committee, may be asked to meet with Colonel Hippler again.

4. Generally, the concept of using universities(or individuals from universities) is good. Specifically, however, there needs to be a lead university to coordinate and collate the investigations. After some discussion, it was suggested that the University of Dayton is probably most appropriate because it is located close to HQ FTD who will retain management of Project Blue Book. Other universities were suggested that could provide personnel to give aerial coverage of CONUS. They are listed below.

East                   West                    South
Rensselaer, Troy, N.Y. Utah                    Vanderbilt
Columbia               Colorado                Duke
NYU                    Iowa                    Univ of Florida
Univ of Conn.          Wisconsin               Georgia Tech
Yale                   Illinois                Univ of Georgia
Cornell                Chicago
Univ of Dayton         Univ of Calif (Berkeley)
Carnegie Tech          Oregon
                       Washington
                       Rice
                       Univ of Texas

Colonel Hippler pointed out that it will probably be September before he gets the money to implement this plan. Dr. O'Lansky pointed out that because of the summer holiday, Colonel Hippler should make contact with the universities before the end of May.

5. Since we are dealing with an emotional phenomenon, there was some discussion about whether universities (i.e., their presidents) would be willing to get involved with UFOs. Dr. O'Brien suggested that Dr. Stevens, as President of Carnegie Tech, might send letters to a few selected university presidents with whom he is acquainted to get some idea of their feelings on this matter. (ACTION: APSBA). In this way we can learn what a typical reaction might be and also some of the pitfalls to avoid when contacting other universities.

6. There are still several unanswered questions or problem areas:

(a) Since the problem is 99% public relations, it is essential that the investigating teams have some medium of skill in press relations. It was strongly suggested that a good solid PIO type (perhaps incognito) be included on the first few investigation teams. This caused quite a bit of discussion and a final answer did not evolve.

(b) The objective is to have impartial scientists from schools with good reputations that have never been involved with UFOs.

(c) Considerable thought must be given to how the contract or contracts are to be written.

(d) In order to utilize their talents to the best advantage, it was proposed and accepted that Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Dr. Donald Menzel form the nucleus of a Consultant-Advisor Team to work with HQ FTD in determining which sightings the university team should investigate.

(e) When teams are selected, it is strongly recommended that they be brought together at some certain location such as HQ FTD and given a thorough briefing on what is expected of them. This briefing should cover all of the intangibles and pitfalls that must be avoided in order to give good Air Force public relations.

(f) Another question that was not fully resolved is how AFSC should get into the act. The Committee's original thought was that someone from the nearest AFSC base should work with the investigating team. The Committee also recommended that a member of the OSI might work with the university teams and give them the benefit of their investigating experience. It was questioned whether this would help or hurt the Air Force effort. Neither of these questions were fully resolved.

(g) it was pointed out that the National Research Council had conducted an exercise in Disaster Research which had involved some investigating teams similar to the ones we are discussing. Although the committee is now defunct, Mrs. Marjorie Wilson, Government Code 1224 - 230/239 has their reports and will be glad to let us review them.

AIR FORCE REGULATION
NO. 80-17

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
Washington, D. C. 19 September 1966

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

This regulation establishes the Air Force program for investigating and analyzing UFOs over the United States. It provides for uniform procedures and release of information. The investigations and analyses prescribed are related directly to the Air Force's responsibility for the air defense of the United States. The UFO Program requires prompt reporting and rapid evaluation of data for successful identification. Strict compliance with this regulation is mandatory.

SECTION A—GENERAL PROVISIONS

1. Explanation of Terms. To insure proper and uniform usage of terms in UFO investigations, reports, and analyses, an explanation of common terms follows:
a. Unidentified Flying Objects. Any aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or appears out of the ordinary to the observer.

b. Familiar or Known Objects/Phenomena: Aircraft, aircraft lights, astronomical bodies (meteors, planets, stars, comets, sun, moon), balloons, birds, fireworks, missiles, rockets, satellites, searchlights, weather phenomena, normal celestial occurrences, dust devils), and other natural phenomena.

2. Program Objectives. Air Force Interest in UFOs is two-fold: to determine if the UFO is a possible threat to the United States and to use the scientific or technical data gained from study of UFO reports. To attain these objectives, it is necessary to explain or identify the stimulus which caused the observer to report his observation as an unidentified flying object.

a. Air Defense. The majority of UFOs reported to the Air Force have been conventional or familiar objects which present no threat to our security.

(1) It is possible that foreign countries may develop flying vehicles of revolutionary method of propulsion.

(2) Frequently, some alleged UFOs are determined to be aircraft. Air Defense Command (ADC) is responsible for identification.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD                                   22 April 1966

SUBJECT:  Scientific Panel to Investigate Reported Sightings of
          Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)

1.  Official correspondence:

    a. SAF-OS to AFCCS, 5 April 1966, specifying arrangements to be made
       to implement SAB recommendations on "Blue Book".

    b. AFCVC to SAF-OS, 14 April 1966, acknowledging that arrangements are
       being made to implement program.

    c. AFRIC to SAF-OI, 14 April 1966, continuing present PTD to SAF-OI
       route for information on current sightings.

2.  Meetings:

    With Major Hector Quintanilla, PTD-WAFD, on current procedures and
    shortcomings.

    With Major Gregory, PTD-AFSC, on administration, procedures and working
    relations.

    With Major Thaddeus W. Kallini, AFNIAAA, on transfer of CPI to REC
    and recommendations on AGR 200-2.

    With SAB (Lt Colonel Harold Steiner) and SAB Ad Hoc Committee members,
    Dr. Emian O'Brien and Dr. Jesse Orlinsky, on specifics of the SAB recom-
    mendations.

    With Colonel Spaulding and Mrs. Sara Hunt, SAF-OI, on everything in
    general as it impinges on information release. Also spent a short time with
    General Garland on UFO information release.

3.  Telephone conversations (covering the same items as in paragraph 2):

    Colonel Hessberg (AFSTA) with Colonel Sleeper and Colonel Walker (AFSC-PTD).

    Lt Colonel Hippler (AFSTA) with Lt Colonel Provan (AFNIA).

    Lt Colonel Hippler with Lt Colonel Jacks (SAF-OI).

    Lt Colonel Hippler with Lt Colonel McIntee (AFNIA).

6. Results:

a. It is expected that the university findings, resulting from in-depth investigations of certain sightings, may indicate whether to continue the FTD UFO program as at present, to increase the effort, or to discontinue all effort and get the Air Force out of the business.

b. It is hoped that better public understanding will result from these investigations. At first, the more fact that a sighting is examined for this scientific investigation may make a "spectacular" out of it and we may lose some ground. Prior press releases of our intentions and objectives may be of aid here.

c. It is possible that there exist some phenomena that may be earmarked for investigation by current university or governmental research programs to gain a better insight into nature. However, such a long-term continuing investigation of specific phenomena would not be a part of this current program.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE         May 9, 1966                Oxford 7-3189 (Copies)

AIR FORCE TO CONTRACT WITH SCIENTISTS
FOR UFO INVESTIGATIONS

The Air Force is taking steps to strengthen scientific investigations of reports it receives on unidentified flying objects (UFO).

The help of more individuals within the scientific community will be sought through contracts calling for prompt, in-depth investigation of selected UFO reports. Air Force officials are now discussing the project informally with university and other scientific leaders to determine their interest.

The decision to award the contracts was based on a recommendation by the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board which reviewed the resources, methods and findings of Project Blue Book - the Air Force program to investigate and evaluate UFO reports.

In its report, which was submitted to the Air Force in March, the investigating committee recommended expanding the program to include investigation of selected sightings by independent scientists. The committee also concluded that there has been no evidence that unidentified flying objects are a threat to national security, and complimented the Air Force on the organization of Project Blue Book.

The Air Force is preparing work statements for the new contracts now. Funds for them will be requested from FY 67 and FY 68 budgets.

SUMMARY OF BROADCASTS CONTAINED IN THIS DIALOG

In yesterday's news, David BURRINGTON comments on the return of US Marines to the Bong Son area, Chet HUNTLEY reports on UFOs and the upcoming investigation. Sen Vance GUTHRIE comments on some of the highlights with the showing of a film on NVN two-part broadcast was televised on VN with the showing of a film on NVN. Ron NESSEN NVN broadcast interviews HARRY CAMRON, who discusses the bloody battle in Saigon. Garrick UTLEY interviews the Commander of the Seventh Fleet about the air war. Richard O'BRIEN visits Army laboratories which are producing bullet-proof vests for use in VN. Roger PETERSON discusses operation DAVY CROCKETT. Eric SEWARD offers an appraisal on the charges of American corruption of the VNese, an Army pilot plans to run for Congress, and mentions have been reported in the assignment of college students to various testing centers for the draft deferment tests.

RED CHINA AND THE BOMB
7:00 AM: The Today Show, NBC-TV

VANOUR interviewing Sen John
PASTORE (D-RI) concerning Red China
and the hydrogen bomb.

Q: In this area, the highest
priority on this, is it possible to
judge how far they are away from exploding a full-scale hydrogen bomb?

A: You can't measure it in terms
of days or weeks or years, but I think that Dr. TELLER, who is quite knowledgeable in this area, has placed it in a matter of several years.

Q: What do you think is the primary implication of this, is its militarization or its political?

A: I think it's more political than if I might be military at the moment. You have a vast area in Asia, and you have this tremendous pressure that is being constantly applied by Red China. You have elements of it in SVN. We have three experiences in Korea. We are beginning to feel it now in Thailand. Now, I don't think that the present fear, or the imminency is that they're going to drop a bomb on San Francisco, or they're going to drop a bomb on Los Angeles, or on Chicago or Washington.

THE TODAY SHOW (Cont'd)
over Taiwan and over Thailand, you can imagine the impact. The diplomatic impact, that other smaller nations will have on the one hand, and on the other hand, the realities of the fear. And then, of course, as a result of that comes into play our commitments that we're always talking about. And I think the time is fast coming when America has to analyze its commitments and consider the whole panoramic situation, and do what has to be done, not on the immediate score but on the long pull.

1STCAV RETURNS TO BONG SON AREA
6:30 PM: Huntley-Brinkley, NBC-TV

CHET HUNTLEY: The 1st Cavdiv today fired its heavy artillery at point blank range to break up a communist attack near Bong Son. The division was at attacked near the battlefield where it killed more than 400 of the enemy last week.

DAVID BURRINGTON (FILM CLIP): In only two months the VG had rebuilt its forces and nearly all of this rich, coastal highland was back under its control. So, the 1stAirCavDiv returned to Bong Son where it had previously fought some of the war's most savage battles.

Intelligence this time was good. The men knew the terrain and soon an entire NVNese bat battalion was spotted.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

HUNTLEY-BRINKLEY (Cont'd)

For three days it was tracked, harassed, and finally surrounded in the hamlet of West Son (?) village.

HUNTLEY: As it stands right now, we don't know how many PAVNs are over there.

BURRINGTON: By PAVNs you mean NVN-

DUNKLE: NVNese, right. And the situation as it stands, we have an element coming up to our left flank and we're going to support them with fire as they sweep the area through to our front. Now, like said before, we don't know how many PAVNs are there, but we estimate a battalion, there're supposed to be two battalions in this area now.

BURRINGTON: What all have you thrown at them?

DUNKLE: We had an air strike, we had ARA. We had mortar fire, battalion mortar fire, artillery, machine gun fire, everything, the whole works.

BURRINGTON: Are you a little surprised that they're still holding out?

DUNKLE: I am. I really am. With the stuff we threw in, I'm surprised that they can really hold like they have been doing.

BURRINGTON: Now, this is your first test under fire, is it not?

DUNKLE: That's right. I've been here approximately two and a half weeks.

BURRINGTON: And what's your reaction to this?

DUNKLE: I'm scared, damned scared. I imagine everybody in my platoon is scared right now. But we know we can lick them.

BURRINGTON: Artillery, air strikes, and helicopter rockets pounded the enemy position until it was obscured by smoke and dust. As other companies moved in the communist battalion began receiving fire from three sides, and finally its resistance weakened.

Eventually more than 90 bodies were found in the VC position along with a battalion flag, American casualties generally were light, but the second platoon was hit hard. There was less concern about villagers. The reckoning was that those who were told to be VC.

There was a lot of fighting in this village this time. One hamlet was devastated because an entire NVNese battalion was spotted here early one evening, and supposedly surrounded.

COMMENTARY ON UFOS

6:40 PM: Chet Huntley Perspective on the News, WRC

CHET HUNTLEY: This spring people from NH to Mich, from Calif to N.J., have been seeing their necks alleged flashing lights or hovering objects that flash by and disappeared upwards.

The government, with the AF designated as the agency to handle the matter, would simply prefer not to talk about UFOs. But people keep on seeing, then nonetheless. After nearly 20 years of this the AF is well organized to investigate these sightings and identify what it can and to file away the remainder as unidentified.

It was just a little obvious recently when a spate of alleged sightings was just a little obvious when a community in Mich, Cong Gerald FORD, who happens to live in that state, apparently so attracted to UFOs, arose in the House and demanded a public hearing. The DEPT DEFENSE managed to get the public hearings shunted aside, but it did beef up its UFO group under the AF to conduct investigations into the matter.

Soon, therefore, teams of scientists will be dotted across the US to investigate thoroughly all UFO sightings. It's interesting and significant that one member of each UFO team is going to be a psychologist. This apparently means that the stability of the UFO observer from here on out is going to be noted.

Thus far there have been 10,147 alleged sightings of UFOs over the years, and 646 of them have not been solved. That isn't a very bad record in other words, the overwhelming majority of alleged sightings have been studied and have been discovered to be of no consequence. They turned out to be missiles, balloons, birds, kites, searchlights, beacons, astronomical bodies, weather conditions, reflections, mirages, fireworks, flares, and even two and then, hoaxes.

The fact also remains that not a single UFO has ever come into the range of the large instruments that span the skies from vantage points all over the world. And, again, scientists agree that nothing has been uncovered by these sightings which reveal technological advances beyond the range of today's scientific knowledge. But we may expect the confusion to be compounded. The NSA is going to test a flying saucer of its

FOREIGN FILM ON NVN
9:00 PM: Report From VN, WETA-TV

DAVID SCHOENBRUN hosted the second of two programs devoted to filmed reports made by foreign reporters on the VN war. In this broadcast, James CAMERON of the London Evening Standard, narrated a film entitled "West-ern Eyewitness in the North of Viet-nam." It was more or less a travelog of NVN, without a major theme, except perhaps that NVN is a country inhabited by people, just like any other country, trying to live as normal a lives as possible under the circumstances.

There were scenes of schools, a TB hospital, a park, and some of the industries of NVN. Also shown were an American aircraft, which had been shot down and was on display, the Bay of the Dragons and coal mine areas on the bay, and scenes from the presidential palace.

During the discussion that followed with Max FRANKEL, Jean LACOUTURE of the French newspaper Le Monde, CAMERON, and SCHOENBRUN, it pointed out that there is something in NVN, other than the bombing in NVN, that is something about the people. The people are not well informed. They have been protesting moments in the US and in Europe. They have made a lot of Norman MORRISON killed himself in front of the PENTA-GON. The people are trying to ignore the US; they simply see us as an imperialist power.

LODGE SHOULD SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE
11:00 PM: News 7 Final, WMAL-TV

JOSEPH McCAFFERY: After a leisurely trip back to Washington to "spot" VN, Amb LODGE is now here. But Indian Secy JAIKHARK doesn't feel he should continue his report just to of-

NEWS 7 FINAL (Cont'd)
HARTKE FILM CLIP): I think Amb LODGE has an obligation and a duty to answer some questions for the American people. They would like to plan talk from the Ambassador, not violating national security, but certainly not hiding behind it. I think the American people are confused by this constant surprising element coming in the situation politically and militarily in VN. We seem to be winning the war every week, but when the week's over we are no better off than we were the week before. In other words, we're winning it by talk and a lot of bombs and a lot of casualties, but we seem to be making no real progress.

GUN BATTLE IN SAIGON
7:00 AM: The Today Show, NBC-TV

GARRICK UTLEY: US officials in Saigon have accepted responsibility for the bloody gun battle which erupted in a Saigon street early Tuesday following a VC terrorist attack.

RON NESSEN (FILM CLIP from Saigon): It was dawn, it was raining, and a truck loaded with VNese men and women, and even some children, was heading down Haibarton (?) St to the Saigon docks to work. At that moment, the truck and its passengers got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

A block and a half ahead of them a VC bomb went off in a doorway. A block behind them an American military police team stepped into the street and thought they were VC shots and fired back. From ahead with 30-cal machine guns. The truck and its passengers were caught in the middle.

It so happens the street is being repaired at that point, and the truck had to swing to the right toward the Brink (?) Hotel for American officers. Nervous guards thought it might be a truck of VC explosives and they fired on it. The truck driver tried to back away but it was too late.

UTLEY: The US Embassy in Saigon has offered to pay compensation for the victims of the gun battle.

THE AIR WAR IN VN

of aircraft. Except as aircraft are determined to be the stimulus for a UFO report, aircraft are not to be reported under the provisions of this regulation.

b. Technical and Scientific. The Air Force will analyze reports of UFOs routinely to attain the program objectives. In this connection these facts are of importance:

(1) The need for further scientific knowledge in progress, astronomy, and physics of the upper atmosphere which may be provided by study and analysis of UFOs and similar aerial phenomena.

(2) The need to report all pertinent facts and to make a direct bearing on scientific analysis and conclusions of UFO sightings.

3. Program Monitor. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Development, is responsible for the overall program, evaluation of investigative procedures, and the conduct of separate scientific investigations.

b. Resources. The Air Force Systems Command will support the program with current resources within the Foreign Technology Division ("FTD") at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, to continue the Project Blue Book effort. Other AFSC resources not used by FTD will be made available.

4. Investigation. Each commander of an Air Force base will provide a UFO investigative team. When notice of a UFO sighting is received, an investigation will be implemented to determine the circumstances of the sighting. An Air Force base receives the notice of a UFO sighting from the base nearest the locale of the sighting. In that event, the reported UFO sighting will be referred to the Air Force base nearest the sighting for action.

EXCEPTIONS: FTD at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, independently or with the help of pertinent Air Force activities, may conduct any other investigation to conclude its analysis or findings. HQ USAF may direct any other investigations.

d. Analysis. FTD will:
(1) Analyze and evaluate all information and evidence reported to base on those UFOs which are not listed as base level.

(2) Use other Government agencies, private industrial companies, and contractor personnel to assist in analyzing and evaluating UFO reports, as necessary.

e. Findings. FTD, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio will prepare a final case report on each sighting reported to it after the data have been properly evaluated. If the final report is deemed significant, FTD will send the report to HQ USAF.

5. Cooperation. All Air Force activities will cooperate with UFO investigations to insure that pertinent information to investigations of UFO sightings are promptly obtained. When feasible, this will include furnishing air or ground transportation and other assistance.

SECTION B - PUBLIC RELATIONS, INFORMATION, CONTACTS, AND RELEASES

4. Response to Public Interest. The Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information (SAF-OI), maintains contact with the public and news media on all aspects of the UFO program and related activities. Private individuals or organizations desiring Air Force interviews, briefings, lectures, or private discussions on UFOs will be instructed to direct their requests to SAF-OI.

WALL STREET JOURNAL 23 December 1965

"New Fireball" Raises
An Old Question: Do
Flying Saucers Exist?
Scientists Assail Air Force
By WILLIAM M. CARLEY
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Not only that, says Gabriel Green, who
heads the California group, "space people give
confirmation indirectly and directly" that
flying saucers exist. Mr. Green, a Los Angeles
film actor and sometime lecturer on unidentified
flying objects (UFOs), says he has been told
by Mrs. Green in this trip's visit from Albuquerque, N.M., that "space people" have been
giving her messages. He is campaigning
briefly, but intensely, to prove his point.

The National Investigations Committee on
Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), a private research organization in Washington, doesn't
hold with that theory. "We reject reports of
flying saucers as being on any real or factual
basis," says a spokesman. So far from 1966
there are 11 such reports. "Many reports,"
says the committee, "can be explained by
investigation would prove that UFOs "are real
physical objects . . . under the control of living
beings."

"As an astrophysicist, the spokesman
says," "There is tremendous number of reports which have been able to support themselves with hard scientific data."

One man who's not confused at all is Charles
A. Maney, professor emeritus of physics and
mathematics at Defiance College in Ohio. Says
he: "People can't seem to understand that
they have 'to measure' something to prove
its existence."

Since NICAP's founding in 1956, it has been
gathering and analyzing UFO reports. However, "Wall this is an imagination taking the
realm of science," says Daniel H. Gillmor, a
critic of the observatory at Delaware. "I have
found no convincing evidence that UFOs are
extraterrestrial."

The possibility of life on Mars is an intriguing one, says Frank B. Salisbury, a professor of plant physiology at Colorado State University. At the
risk of being unpopular, he says, the scientific
community generally regards the idea of life
on Mars as highly speculative.

Reaching the homogeneity controversy, one
has been the large number of reports from well
known people and scientists with technical backgrounds. Since 1957, more than 170 private, military and commercial pilots have
given topographical sightings of strange objects in the sky.

swer all Congressional and Presidential queries regarding UFOs forwarded to the Air Force.

(2) Process requests from Congressional sources in accordance with AFR 11-7.
a. SAF-OI will:
(1) Respond to correspondence from individuals requesting information on the UFO Program and evaluations of sightings.
(2) Release information on UFO sightings and results of investigations to the general public.

c. Exceptions. In response to local inquiries regarding UFOs reported in the vicinity of an Air Force base, the base commander may release information to the news media or the public after the sighting has been positively identified. If the sighting for the level, the commander may state that the sighting is under investigation and conclusions will be released by SAF-OI after the investigation is completed. The commander may also state that the Air Force will review and analyze the results of the investigation. Any further inquiries will be directed to SAF-OI.

SECTION C—PREPARING AND SUBMITTING REPORTS

6. General Information:
a. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Development, USAF and the ADC have a direct and immediate interest in UFOs reported within the US. All Air Force activities will conduct UFO investigations to the extent necessary for reporting action (see paragraphs 9, 10, 11, and 12). Investigations may be carried beyond this point when the preparing officer believes the action or public relations aspect of the case warrants further investigation. In this case, the investigator will coordinate his continued investigation with FTDI.

b. Paragraph 7 will be used as a guide for examining, investigating, and reporting. Paragraph 11 is an outline of the reporting format.

c. Inquiries should be referred to SAF-OI (see paragraph 5).

d. If possible, an individual selected as a UFO investigator should have a scientific or technical background and experience as an investigator.

e. Reports required by this regulation are excluded from assignment of a reports control symbol in accordance with paragraph 38, AFR 500-5.

7. Guidance in Preparing Reports. The usefulness of a UFO report depends largely on accuracy, timeliness, skill and resourcefulness of the person who receives the initial information and makes the report. Following are aids for screening, evaluating and reporting sightings:

a. Activities receiving initial reports of aerial objects and phenomena will screen the information to determine if the report concerns a valid UFO as defined in paragraph 1a. Reports not falling within that definition do not require further action. Aircraft flares, jet exhausts, condensation trails, blinking or steady lights observed at night, lights circling near airports and airways, and other aircraft phenomena should not be reported as they do not fall within the definition of a UFO.

EXCEPTION: Reports of known objects will be made to FTDI when this information originally had been reported by local news media as a UFO and the witness has contacted the Air Force. (Do NOT solicit reports.) When such a report is received, an attachment should be included as paragraph 8c.)

b. Detailed study will be made of the logic, consistency, and authenticity of the observer's report. An interview with the observer, by persons competent to interpret the report, is especially valuable in determining the reliability of the source and the validity of the information. Factors for particular attention are the observer's age, occupation, and education, and whether he has a technical or scientific background. A report that a witness is completely familiar with certain aspects of a sighting should indicate specific qualifications to substantiate such familiarity.

c. The following procedures will assist the investigating officer in completing the report and arriving at a conclusion as required in paragraph 11.
(1) When feasible, contact local authorities (a COW) units, and attempt to establish the time and place of sighting. Contact any persons or organizations that may have additional data on the UFO or can verify evidence—visual, electronic, or other.
(2) Consult military or civilian weather forecasters for data on tracks of weather

He will make every effort to obtain pertinent items of information and to test all possible leads, clues, and hypotheses. The investigating officer will receive from the initial report its in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot survey and follow-up than subsequent investigative personnel and analysts who may be far removed from the area and who may arrive too late to obtain vital data or information necessary for firm conclusions. The comments will include the investigating officer's impressions and conclusions will be in the last paragraph of the report submitted through channels. The reporting official will contact FTPD (Area Code 513, 257-0916 or 257-6678) for verbal authority to continue investigations.

11. Basic Reporting Data and Format. Show the abbreviation "UFO" at the beginning of the text of all electrical reports and in the subject of any follow-up written reports. Include required data in all electrical reports, in the order shown below:

a. Description of the Object(s):
(1) Shape.
(2) Compared to a known object.
(3) Color.
(4) Number.
(5) Formation, if more than one.
(6) Any discernible features or details.
(7) Tail, trail, or exhaust, including its size.
(8) Sound.
(9) Other pertinent or unusual features.

b. Description of Course of Object(s):
(1) What first called the attention of observer(s) to the object(s)?
(2) Angle of elevation and azimuth of object(s) when first observed. (Use theodolite or compass measurement if possible.)
(3) Angle of elevation of object(s) upon disappearance. (Use theodolite or compass measurement if possible.)
(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers of object(s). (Use elevations and azimuth, not altitude.)
(5) How did the object(s) disappear?
(Instantaneously to the North, for example.)
(6) How long were the object(s) visible? (Be specific—5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.)

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Use one or any combination of the following items: Ground-visual, air-visual, ground-electronic, air-electronic (if electronic, specify type of radar.)
(2) Statement as to optical aids (tele-

scopes, binoculars, etc.) used and descrip-
tion thereof.
(3) If the sighting occurred while air-
borne, give type of aircraft, identification
number, altitude, heading, speed, and home
station.

a. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) Greenwich date-time group of sight-
ing and local time.
(2) Light Conditions (use one of the
following terms: Night, day, dawn, dusk).
e. Location of Observer(s). Give exact
latitude and longitude coordinates of each
observer, and/or geographical position. In
electrical reports, give a position with refer-
ence to a known landmark in addition to the
coordinates. For example, use "2 mi N of
Deville," "3 mi SW of Blue Lake," to pre-
clude errors due to teletype garbling of fig-
ures.

f. Identifying Information on Observ-
er(s):
(1) Civilian—Name, age, mailing ad-
dress, occupation, education and estimate of
reliability.
(2) Military—Name, grade, organiza-
tion, duty, and estimate of reliability.

g. Weather and Winds—Aloft Conditions at
Time and Place of Sighting:
(1) Observer(s) account of weather
conditions.
(2) Report from nearest AWS or US
Weather Bureau Office of wind direction
and velocity in degrees and knots at sur-
face, 6,000', 10,000', 16,000', 20,000', 30,000',
50,000', and 80,000', if available.
(3) Ceiling.
(4) Visibility.
(5) Amount of cloud cover.
(6) Thunderstorms in area and quad-
rant in which located.
(7) Vertical temperature gradient.
h. Any other unusual activity or condi-
tion, such as astronomical, or other-
wise, that might account for the sighting.
i. Interference from compliance with air
defense directives.

j. Location, approximate altitude, and
general direction of flight of any air traffic
or balloon releases in the area that might
possibly account for the sighting.

k. Position of the comments of the pre-
paring officer, including his preliminary
analysis of the possible cause of the sight-
ings(s). (See paragraph 10.)

12. Reporting Physical Evidence:
a. Photographic:
(1) Still Photographs. Forward the
original negative to FTD (TDETI) Wright-
Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433, and indicate
the place, time, and date the photograph was
taken.
(2) Motion Pictures. Obtain the origi-
nal film. Examine the film strip for apparent
cuts, alterations, obliterations, or defects. In
the report comment on any irregularities,
particularly in films received from other than
official sources.
(3) Supplemental Photographic Infor-
mation. Negatives and prints often are in-
sufficient to provide certain valid data or
permit firm conclusions. Information that
aids in plotting or an estimating distances,
velocity, and movements includes:
(a) Type and make of camera.
(b) Type, focal length, and make of
lens.
(c) Brand and type of film.
(d) Shutter speed used.
(e) Lens opening used; that is, "f"
stop.
(f) Filters used.
(g) Was tripod or solid stand used.
(h) Was "panning" used.
(i) Exact direction camera was
pointing with relation to true North, and its
angle with respect to the ground.
(4) Other Camera Data. If supplemen-
tal information is unobtainable, the mini-
mum camera data required are the make of
camera, and the smallest and largest "F" stop
and shutter speed readings of the camera.
(5) Radar: Forward two copies of each
still camera photographic print. Tile radar-
scope photographs per AFR 95-7.
Classify radar scope photographs per AFR
205-1.

NOTE: If possible, develop film before
forwarding. Mark undeveloped film clearly
to indicate this fact, to avoid destruction by
exposure through mail channels to final ad-
dresses.

Materiel. Air Force echelons receiving
suspected or actual UFO material will safe-
guard the material and take any defacing or altera-
tions which might reduce its value for in-
telligence examination.

c. Photographs, Motion Pictures, and Neg-
atives Submit by Individuals:
Often submit photographic and motion pic-
ture material as part of their UFO reports
All original material submitted will be re-
turned to the individual after completion of
necessary studies, analysis, and duplication
by the Air Force.

Research and Development

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

AFR 80-17, 19 September 1966, is changed as follows:

3c. EXCEPTIONS: FTD at Wright-Patterson ... for separate investigations. The University of Colorado will, under a research agreement with the Air Force, conduct a study of UFOs. This program (to run approximately 15 months) will be conducted independently and without restrictions. The university will enlist the assistance of other conveniently located institutions that can field investigative teams. All UFO reports will be submitted to the University of Colorado, which will be given the fullest cooperation of all UFO Investigating Officers. Every effort will be made to keep all UFO reports unclassified. However, if it is necessary to classify a report because of method of detection or other factors not related to the UFO, a separate report including all possible information will be sent to the University of Colorado.

8b(6). University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80302, ATTN: Dr. Condon. (Mail copy of message form.)

8e. Negative or Inapplicable Data. Renumber as paragraph 9.

11k. Position title, name, rank, official address, telephone area code, office and home phone, and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting(s). (See paragraph 10.)
