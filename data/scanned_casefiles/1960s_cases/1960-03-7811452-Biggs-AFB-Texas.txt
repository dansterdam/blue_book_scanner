Activity of Aerial Phenomena Research Organization

CAFOI-3d (Maj Tucker)

1. Reference attached copy of a letter from Mrs [redacted] of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization to Major Lawrence J. Tucker, dated 18 April 1960.

2. The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization has not forwarded any material or data to AFRO, nor has there been any attempt to establish liaison.

3. It should be noted that APRO is contorting the meaning of AFR 200-2, dated 14 September 1959, particularly Paragraphs 5a and 6a. Paragraphs 5a and 6a contain information to be used as guidance by the investigators. To our knowledge the information claimed by APRO has never been under Air Force investigation.

4. On 25 March 1960, at 1050G (0550 local), three airmen standing guard duty on the range at Biggs AFB, Texas sighted an unidentified flying object. The witnesses described the object as glowing blue-white, approximately the size of a half-collar held at arm's length, round, and moving at very high speed. The witnesses all agreed the object left no trail or trail, but did make a sound like a child's top with holes.

The object was reported as moving generally from W to ENE and was in sight approximately four seconds. The authorities at Biggs contacted an investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2, but were unable to determine the cause. Analysis of all the available information points toward this object being a missile. The early hour when the sighting took place is probably why there were no other witnesses to the location.

5. For your information this sighting was classified confidential by the reporting organization. However, none of the information contained in this correspondence is considered classified.

UFO SIGHTING, BIGGS AFB, 25 MARCH 1960                                27 OCT 1960

SPGR-34 (Lt Col Tackitt)

1. On 25 March 1960, at 1052 (CST local), three airmen standing guard duty on the ramp at Biggs Air Force Base sighted an unidentified flying object. The witnesses described the object as plating blue-white, approximately the size of a half-dollar held at arm's length, and shaped round. The witnesses all agree that the object was moving at a very high speed and made a sound like a child's top with holes, but that the object did not appear to leave a trail. The object was reported via normal channels from 1st to 4th and was in sight approximately four seconds.

2. Analysis of all available information indicates that the object responsible for this sighting was probably a bolide. The early hour at which this sighting occurred is probably why there were no other witnesses to the incident.

3. The following personnel assigned to the 95th Combat Defense Squadron, Biggs AFB, Texas were the witnesses:

Stout, John G., A/3c
Allan, James, A/3c
Elchorn, Kenneth L., A/3c

4. For your information this sighting was classified confidential by the reporting organization. However, none of the information contained in this correspondence is considered classified.

There is also a small geometric diagram in the top left corner of the page, but the details are not clear enough to describe precisely.

The only text I can discern on this page is at the top of the document, which reads:

The only text I can clearly see in this image is "E. Stripe" located in the bottom right quadrant of the document. The rest of the image appears to be a schematic or diagram with curved and angular line segments forming a geometric pattern.

THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM WITNESSES APPEARS TO BE REASONABLY RELIABLE AND THE EXPLAINED INCIDENTS APPARENTLY OCCURRED SUBSTANTIALLY AS REPORTED, ALTHOUGH POSITIVE EVIDENCE IS LACKING AT THIS TIME.

WEATHER CONDITIONS COUPLED WITH THE APPARENT LACK OF AIRCRAFT, MISSILE OR BALLOON ACTIVITY, TENDS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE STATEMENTS OF THE OBSERVERS. THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER WAS PRESENT AT THE SCENE OF THE SIGHTING WITHIN A MATTER OF A FEW MINUTES OF THE INCIDENT AND PERSONALLY OBSERVED THE CONDITIONS. NONE OF THE UFO'S WERE OBSERVED BY THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER. REFERENCE PARA 151 OF CITED REGULATION. NONE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: LT COLONEL BYRON KING, PROVOST MARSHAL AT WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE WAS CONTACTED AND REPORTED THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN OBSERVED IN THE AREA AND FURNISHED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: ARMY INTELLIGENCE IN THE AREA HAD NO REPORT OF ANY UNUSUAL INCIDENTS. HOLLOMAN AFB AND NEW MEXICO REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR AT THE TIME. THE ARMY REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY AIRCRAFT OR MISSILES

IN THE AIR AT THE TIME. RADAR DIVISION OF THE SIGNAL MISSILE SUPPORT AGENCY AT WHITE SANDS DID NOT HAVE THEIR RADAR WORKING PRIOR TO 0530 HOURS. CAPTAIN W.J. GESSNER, 1500TH AACS SQUADRON, BIGGS AFB TEXAS WAS CONTACTED AND REPORTED THAT THEIR TOWER PERSONNEL HAD NOT OBSERVED ANYTHING UNUSUAL. MR. [REDACTED], SENIOR CONTROLLER FOR BALCON DURING THIS SHIFT, WAS CONTACTED AND REPORTED THAT NO UNUSUAL SIGHTINGS HAD BEEN OBSERVED. ADDITIONAL SIGHTINGS: TWO (2) ADDITIONAL SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED BY TWO (2) INDIVIDUALS IN THE SAME IMMEDIATE AREA WITHIN ONE HALE HOUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE ORIGINAL SIGHTINGS. HOWEVER, INTENSIVE INTERROGATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS INDICATED THAT THE INFORMATION WAS VAGUE AND PROBABLY THE RESULT OF NERVOUS TENSION. AT 1225 25 MARCH 1960 SEVEN (7) INDIVIDUALS, TWO (2) OF WHICH WERE THE ORIGINAL OBSERVERS STATED THEY HEARD A SOUND VERY SIMILAR TO THAT HEARD AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL SIGHTINGS BUT NO UFO WAS OBSERVED. HOWEVER NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COULD BE DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THIS SOUND.

ATTN OF:   BLOE.000

SUBJECT:   Reference to message ACM-42 A-10.97-B, 1 April 1960       14 April 1960

TO:        ATIC
           Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

           Reference your message (Unclassified), ACM-42 A-10.97-B, 1 April
           1960, from 95th CDS, 95th Combat Defense Squadron, 95th Combat Support
           Group, SAC, Biggs Air Force Base, Texas.

           Estimated brightness of light, compared to blue Taxiway marker
           lights, 6.6 amp, 150 watts: Observer I stated that it was approximately
           25 percent brighter; Observer II stated that it was approximately 15
           percent brighter. Observer III stated that it was 75-85 percent as
           bright as the runway-taxiway marker lights. The tail section and the
           upper part of the fuselage of the G-92 can be seen from the tower. Ob-
           servers I and II saw the object simultaneously at 10:50A. As near as
           can be determined, Observer III saw the object within approximately five
           (5) seconds of the sighting time of Observers I and II.

           Mr. [REDACTED], Research Associate from the University of
           Chicago, at the McDonald Observatory, Fort Davis, Texas, was contacted,
           in reference to the sighting. In addition, Mr. [REDACTED] was also
           contacted. He came out the same day and stated that he was present in
           the main dome at the time of the sighting. He could not be contacted as
           he was away. Like Denver, Wisconsin.
