UFO Observations, 23 May 68 & 17 Jun 68

1. This replies to your undated letter which we received on 25 July 1969 concerning your sightings of 23 May and 17 June 1968 at Bradenton, Florida. As you will be extremely hard to explain, you should report it to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate assessment.
2. Your sighting of 17 June 1968 appears to be very similar to a phenomena seen on this date concerning four open decays of which only have been reportedly for your observation.
3. Although your sighting occurred over thirty days ago, we are impressed with your concerning AF Form 117 and its return in the self-addressed envelope. By doing so, we will be able to include your sighting for information purposes which may be of value in evaluating other reports.
4. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir:

On May 23, 1968 I observed something very unusual. I was outside may home at about 8:00 in the evening observing the constellations when I noticed a very bright light in the southwestern sky. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but the light was brighter than any I had ever seen from a satellite. It seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly in an east to west direction. After observing it for several minutes, I called my wife to come and look at it. She agreed that it was very unusual and we watched it for about 15 minutes. During this time, the light seemed to be getting closer and appearing to change in shape. At one point it appeared to be shaped like a football. Then it began to fade and finally disappeared from sight. We were both amazed at what we had seen and could not think of any logical explanation for it. The whole incident left us very puzzled. Often the would-be occurrence of such events makes me wonder if there is indeed more to the universe than meets the eye. It may be a mistake to discuss it further, but I felt I should pass on my observation from the start, if it is of any interest.

I just appeared, it wasn't any familiar shape. It was a light, a
beautiful light, almost white, glowing, about the size of a 50 
cent piece. It wasn't a familiar light because it didn't shoot
up from the ground and it wasn't any practical occasion to have
this.
Called Cotton, Fla. Police and the
object looked as though it could drop further about 2000 feet.
The object could go break further although it floated very
slowly and softly as if the laws were suspended.
I heard the exploitation. The sound of the exploitation sounded
like a jet taking off.  There were no changing colors in the sky.
The skyt was drug clear.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document containing text.

The text in the document is as follows:

and warn, there was no moon. The object which I saw had me frightened, characteristics of an oval and luminescent on the tip appeared as sharp and seemed quite close, as then the object appears to have braked suddenly and then hovered only a short distance away. It surprised and alarmed me as much as it for as long as it was visible on the first experience.

On June 17, 1968 my friend and I observed another strange phenomena. We were on the first floor of our homes when we noticed a peculiar light, the size of which appeared to be the size of a car. At first, they thought it might be a plane or helicopter, but the object moved in a strange manner, neither up nor down, nor from side to side. It simply stood still. It then began to move slowly without any visible means of propulsion, We observed this "object" for 15 to 20 minutes. During this observation, the object changed colors from a brilliant white to a deep orange-red. It then returned to the brilliant white color. The object then simply vanished, there was no trail, no noise, nothing, it simply disappeared. I then called the police and reported the incident, but they were unable to explain what we had observed.

Transcription of the text in the document:

A straight line about 50° than disappeared, while may have and I were watching the object, it seemed to be nothing to appearanceIt was flying at a high rate of speed, about 50° or 60° from the horizon and began to make a zig-zag course going up and down in an irregular line of flight, the last and descent of which covered about 7 seconds. Enclosed is a picture of what may have been and I have it pretty well learned by heart. So may those of you who have not seen the object to be looked over as I am puzzled. Both the object and I were quite surprised at the disappearance, the size of the object seemed to be less than the angle of a matchheas thumb, both had the magnitude of a gull or hawk at a distance. I am puzzled. Both the shape and object moved from west to east and affect more pronounced from northeast to southwest, both had the magnitude of a gull or hawk at a distance.

To start, I found any more information in generally watching what I saw and plan to let me know any and I will be happy to give it to you. Well, I do not know how many words would tell the same thing the I could me.
