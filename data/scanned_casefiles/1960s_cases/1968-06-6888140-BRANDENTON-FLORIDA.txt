UFO Observations, 23 May 68 & 17 Jun 68

Bradenton, Florida 33505

1. This replies to your undated letter which we received on 23 July 1968. Your sightings of 23 May and 17 June 1968 are over thirty days old, and as such, would be extremely hard to evaluate. For this reason, we suggest that if you ever sight another UFO, you should report it to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has an UFO Investigator who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

2. Your sighting of 17 June 1968 appears to be very similar to either a meteor observation or satellite debris decaying into the atmosphere. On this date there were four such decays of which one may have been responsible for your observation.

3. Although your sighting occurred over thirty days ago, we would appreciate your completing the enclosed AF Form 117 and return it in the self-addressed envelope. By doing so, we will be able to file your sighting other information for purposes which may be of assistance in evaluating other reports.

4. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Contracted 23 July 1968

Dear Sir:

On May 23, 1968 I observed something very unusual. I was outside my home at about 8:00 in the evening observing the constellation Leo. At about 30° above the horizon a brilliant white light appeared. Its magnitude was brighter than the magnitude of Regulus, which was the brightest star in the sky at that time. It stayed bright for three seconds, then it suddenly exploded and orange fragments fell to the earth and looked as if they landed on the earth. The whole incident took about ten seconds.

After the whole occurrence I went into the house trying to figure out what it was. It wasn't a meteor because it didn't fall from the sky, it

Just appeared, it wasn't an airplane because if it was it would of been in all the papers. it wasn't a final because it don't shoot up from the ground and it wasn't any special occasion to have fireworks.

About three miles from my home there is a shopping complex called Cortez-Plaza and the object looked as if it exploded about 20° above the complex. The object could of been further away because three seconds lapsed between the time I saw the object explode and the time I heard the explosion. The sound of the explosion sounded like the sound of a jet taking off. There were very few clouds in the sky, the air was dry.

and warm, there was no moon.
The object which I saw had
no flight characteristics or
angular velocity as when the
object appeared it was a bright
white, and the fragments after
it exploded didn't look as if
they were on fire but just
glowed and change color.

On June 17, 1968 my friend
and I observed another occurrence.
It was around 8:30 and my
friend and I were stargazing,
when we both saw about 60°
above the horizon what looked
like a meteor because it had
a tail, but it didn't fall like
a meteor, but traveled along
the horizon. The object was
white and the tail was white
with a very slight tint of
yellow. The object moved on

a straight line about 50° then
disappeared. While my friend
and I were watching the object
something peculiar happened.
Where the object and tail met
three little objects fell off the
solid object and went into
the tail and ---- along
and the whole occurrence took
about 7 seconds. Enclosed is
a picture of what my friend
and I saw. If you have copy
idea of what either of the ob-
jects which I saw was please
let me know because personally
I'm puzzled. Both objects were
the size of a matchhead
held out at arms length, both
had the magnitude of the star
Sirius, the first object just
appeared in the north and the
second object moved from west

to cast. If you need any more
information in evaluating what
I saw please let me know and
I will be happy to give it to you
I would of wrote sooner but
I didn't think any body would
believe me.

Sincerely,
Bradenton Fla. 35568

P.S. The reason why there are a lot
of mistakes is because I'm writing
with my friend and that's got
recting my mistake.
