I was out work on Sept. 14, 1960 during a coffee break. It was setting in a truck nearby. For perhaps 2 hrs. looking out TR sky when I saw this shiny object. I was in my direction. I was question with an able crew looking. We saw one & I was getting near. It appeared to be only one & I would best describe it as a bright light with close formation. Seems like following a definite pattern in sky.

These reports were in sight for 15 mins. Apparently due South for some flight pattern. They seemed to change color from a brownish white to a pale orange - it would appear their direction to be about a 1,500 miles among. This is shown stated at some seen many into cut night to much to others to be the same.

Fly my South for coming they encountered with the Carter shadow.

These people with me were more or less strategy due to strike conditions. Some of the town - I sincerely hope this has done of some value.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

Dear Sir:

In the early part of Sept. due west of my home I have sighted an object due west moving toward me (our city) at great height. With this I began to observe it closely. It was the same place in the sky for some time. I noticed that was not a man made object. For at first it was high up & one off & degrees follow. It started & was slowly upward. Those objects moving slowly probably set or get above 2 miles.

Myself, wife & daughter saw this. We will not swear to the exact time but it was about 8:00 PM. I am not surprised to learn that...
