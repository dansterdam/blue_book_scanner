Gentlemen:

I am very interested in U.F.O. sighting's in my own State. There have been sighting's in my own Town, I have seen two, and my friend has seen them too.

I would be very glad if you would send me some information on the U.F.O's. Also I would like to know how many States they have been seen in. I have read books on this subject and find them very interesting.

I read an article in my home Town paper which is Titled "Chasing Flying Saucers" By George Fawcett. There is information there, but not as much as I would like. Please send me any thing you have on this Subject as I would like to know more about them. Thank You.

Yours Truly

Dear [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letters of November 26, 1963. In your both letters, information on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

There is no evidence, in more than 8,000 cases that the Air Force has investigated, that would indicate that Unidentified Flying Objects come from outer space and are interplanetary vehicles. Sightings received by the Air Force have been identified as natural phenomena, balloons, or even mirage or reflection. The very few reports which cannot be identified have been because not enough information was submitted with the report to make definitive identification.

We are enclosing two copies of two brochures on the subject of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, which in the name given by the Air Force to the study of Unidentified Flying Objects. By reading these, the back of the first brochure you will find a list of books which you might find interesting. One book in particular which you might find interesting is "The World of Flying Saucers" by Ruppelt and Boyd, which your public library may have.

Sincerely,

Dear Gentlemen:

I am interested in U.F.O.'s.

I want to know if you can give as much information as you can access. Because I see lots of lights in the sky some are parallel some are big could you tell me if I can or might in the sky know what is U.F.O. or not. And what are some of the objects you can mistake it as most. And could you tell me the planets that U.F.O.'s come from. Please could you give me some sightings. Because I wanted some sighting to so I can make reports on them. Could you tell me how the men or what ever they are can stand the pressure.

BURLINGTON, MASS
NOVEMBER 2, 1963

Dear Gentlemen:

I would like to know what THE UFOs really are. And just about how many UFOs that the pentagon has spotted, if any. And if you have decided which planet that they come from if they came from a planet. How could they be made and who made them. Wear do they come from, and wear do they go. And do you think someone from earth made them.

One of my friends say they are on Jupiter, and so how can they stand the gases and how can they see these way around through the thick clouds of gas. It possible I would like as much information on UFOs as possible.

Sincerely Yours
