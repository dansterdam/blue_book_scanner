(U) Unidentified Flying Object
Andover, Massachusetts
1930 hours, 26 August 1960

TO: Commander, AFCGDD

1. The following confirm information telephonically furnished the Office
of the Provost Marshal, L. G. Ransom Field, on 30 August 1960, concerning
Subject incident:

On 30 August 1960, Special Agent RICHARD A. HOLMES, Detachment 102, OSI
District Nr. 1, L. G. Ransom Field, was contacted telephonically by [redacted]
Everett, Mass., Personnel Manager, advised that on 26 August 1960, at approximately
1930 hours, he, his wife, and three children sighted an unidentified flying
object from the yard of their home in Andover.

[redacted] stated as they were facing southeast they observed a twin-
engine and two "piper cub" type aircraft flying close together from East
to West at 3,000 to 4,000 feet. While watching these airplanes, another
object appeared and seemed to follow the three aircraft. This object was
silver, flat and square with a short cigar-shaped nose, had a dome or "half
globe" on the bottom of the fuselage which glowed with an orange or orange-
yellow color, and was approximately the size of a "pursuit type airplane."

[redacted] watched the object travel across the sky from East to West
for approximately three minutes, at which time it descended at about a
thirty degree angle from the original altitude of 35,000 feet to approximately 15,000 feet. The object at the later altitude when it became obscured from view by a group of large trees thirty
feet away.

[redacted] estimated the speed of the unidentified flying object as
approximately 300 miles per hour, or "the speed of a commercial passenger
airplane." The object did not leave a vapor trail, did not make any sound,
and did not have any markings which would identify it as a familiar object.

[redacted] stated the sky was clear and bright although the sighting
was made during the hour of sunset.
