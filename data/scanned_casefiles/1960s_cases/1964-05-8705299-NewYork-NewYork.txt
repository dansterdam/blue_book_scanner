Dear Ben:

Two friends of mine spotted an unusual occurrence
while doing some astronomy the other evening.

I thought if the Air Force is still keeping an
active check on UFO's, you might pass it on to whoever
handles that sort of thing.

Please let me know of any comment you may receive.

Regards,

Time: 2100 New York time

Place: New York City (Penthouse roof)

Witnesses: [redacted]

Bright, white star, no variation, rose in South and moved fairly rapidly towards Zenith. First assumed to be ECHO. However, it remained stationary at Zenith for several minutes. Then continued due North and disappeared in horizon haze. Viewed for most of time in 3¼" QUASAR at ∕80 and ∕160- appeared as pure star image. In sight about 15 minutes. Zenith passage about 09.00 H. Clear night.

ECHO 1 was observed in transit at 11.01, and appeared identical except for stationary period at Zenith.

In its Northward motion, the object was observed to pass between l and Y Ursa Major.

June 11, 1964.

Dear Mr.

General LeBailly has asked me to reply to your letter of June 8, 1964, in which you enclosed a report of an unusual aerial object which was observed by Messrs at approximately 9 p.m. on May 7(th).

Echo I was responsible for this observation as well as the later sighting at approximately 10:17 p.m. The satellite made two passes over New York City, the evening of May 17th, one at 9:01 p.m. northeast of the city, 60° above the horizon, moving northwest, and the second at 11:03 p.m., north of the city, 20° above the horizon, moving southeast.

It probably gave the appearance of being stationary at one point since it was at the zenith and viewing it from the ground made it appear to slow down or stop together until it began its swing downward or from its arc.

Sincerely,

HASTON M. JACKS

Dear Mr.

In my letter of June 11th to Mr. , the time computed for the passage of Echo I was completely in error, as he pointed out in his telephone conversation of this afternoon. I regret our misvaluation of your report and we will try to rectify our previous calculations as soon as we possibly can.

In this connection, would you and Mr. Clarke find filling out the attached Form 164 with our USAF Technical Information sheet. With these completed and in hand, our project office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will attempt to find a cause for this unusual phenomena.

I am also inclosing two envelopes for your convenience in replying. As soon as we have completed our analysis, we will advise you further.

Sincerely,

MASTON T. JACKS
Major USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

New York, New York

1/R: Conversion from Daylight Saving Time to Eastern Standard Time indicates observation of ECHO. Witness informed by telephone conversation with Hq USAF (SGT FB) Mrs Gaiser.
