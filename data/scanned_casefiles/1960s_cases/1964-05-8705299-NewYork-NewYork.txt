Dear Ben:

Two friends of mine spotted an unusual occurrence 
while doing some astronomy the other evening.  

I thought if the Air Force is still keeping an
active check on UFO's, you might pass it on to whoever
handles that sort of thing.

Please let me know of any comment you may receive.

Regards

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a sighting of a bright, white star that moved steadily southward and was observed for several minutes. The object was identified as ECHO 1, a satellite, and its motion was observed to pass between land and Ursa Major. The document includes details about the date, time, location, and witnesses of the sighting, as well as the signature of the observer.

Text from the document:

Date: 17 May 1964
Time: 2100 New York time 
Place: New York City (Penthouse roof)
Witnesses: [redacted]

Bright, white star, no variation, rose in South and moved steadily towards north. First assumed to be ECHO. However, it remained stationary at zenith for several minutes. Then continued due North and disappeared in horizon haze - Viewed for most of time in 3Â° QUESTAR at 860 and /1600 appeared as pure star image. In sight about 15 minutes, zenith passage about 09.00 H. Clear night.

ECHO 1 was observed in transit at 11.01, and appeared identical except for stationary period at zenith.

In its Northward motion, the object was observed to pass between land Y Ursa Major.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of UFOs. The document appears to be a letter dated June 11, 1964, addressed to "Mr. [redacted]" and signed by "MSTON M. JACK, Major, USAF, Public Information Division, Office of Information."

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

General Lamley has asked me to reply to your letter of June 8, 1964, which you enclosed a report by an unusual aerial object which was observed by personnel of the Manhattan Construction Company at approximately 8:50 p.m. on the evening of the 17th, one at 9:10 p.m. north of their construction site at 193rd Street and Broadway, New York City, on the evening of June 17, 1964.

I echo that I was responsible for this observation. It was the later sighting at approximately 9:10 p.m. which made light of two hazes over New York City. The object was described as being at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and was observed from one point since it was at the zenith and viewing it from the ground made it appear to stop altogether. It then began its swing downward, and it did not stop altogether until it began its swing downward.

Sincerely,
MSTON M. JACK
Major, USAF
Public Information Division

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

In my letter of June 11th to Mr. [redacted], I informed him that I was completely prepared for the passage of Echo I was computed for the passage of Echo I was computed for the release of this letter on June 16th. However, our reevaluation of your short-term sighting report leads us to believe that we would not be able to possibly can.

Some further connection would you and Mr. [redacted] make during our telephone conversation which occurred here on June 10th when I called to verify certain information contained in your letter. Also enclosed are two envelopes for your convenience in applying for your completed analyses, we will advise you further.

Sincerely,
