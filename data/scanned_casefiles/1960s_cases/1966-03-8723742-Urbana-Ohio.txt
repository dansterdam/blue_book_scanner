Reference your recent letter of 28 October 1966 regarding an unidentified object observed during this year. I am sorry I cannot substantiate your observation on what you saw and your wife observed.

We would like to point out that your observation has been much discussed or may be taken as a plastic or analysis you will be notified. If we cannot explain what you observed, we will tell you so.

Thank you for reporting your unidentified observation to the Air Force. 

Sincerely,

MAJOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF

To whom it may concern, 
This letter is of no value to you.But I was reading a Science & Mechanic Magazine and it has a write up on -- UFO.Now,I'll tell you I read everything I can on this subject,so you don't have to. It's all baloney.But if you don't want to be taken in by the magazines hit home.
It was 1:55 in the morning this March fighting of this year.I can't tell you just exactly what I can't tell you but I can tell --my wife saw it first.She told me to get up and look at it.I did,but I didn't pay much attention to it.But though it was beautiful,I went back to --be--,but I could see the light on the bedroom wall,and it was awful bright.
The next morning,my wife was still talking about it.So I told her I didn't believe a word of it.Though it was awfully bright,I guess at times the lights in the house might be brighter and bigger than it should had been.But I was sleepy and it didn't impress me much.
At 1:00 the next morning I was getting ready for bed,after watching a late movie.So I went out on side to see were.I couldn't find it.
Just two or three nights were clear,and I don't know whether the moon was a half or just about 25 degrees off.But whatever it was,I was a brilliance of light brighter than this house or buildings around.
"We have talked about this to ourselves".Says it was Jupiter.But I don't see how it could be that big and not the next-but I sure wish I had made up and watched it a little longer than I did.If you could tell me if I was wrong,or give us an explanation.I would appreciate it.Cause it look like our names kept out of print.
I hope you can read this.I'm not the best typist in the world.And I hope this doesn't waste too much of your time.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically a proposed reply to a letter regarding an unidentified observation of a bright glowing ball in March 1966.

Proposed reply to letter from
Dear
Reference your unidentified observation in March 1966 of an unusual bright glowing ball that was observed by both you and your wife. We have studied the information submitted and are unable to locate the exact stimuli. Without the exact date and more precise information on how the object disappeared we are unable to make a complete investigation.
It is possible that you observed an astronomical body. However, the only such body in the immediate part of the sky where you observed the object in March, was the star Antares. This is reddish in color and should not have appeared bright blue-white. As such, the information you submitted is categorized as insufficient data for evaluation and filed accordingly.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. It contains a sketch showing the trajectory and position of an unidentified object in the sky. The sketch includes a compass rose, as well as instructions for the viewer to mark the positions of the object on the curved line and the compass.

The text on the page reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Text from the document:

In the first place my wife seen it first. She was woken up by the humming sound. She then got me up.

I was sleepy, but I could remember it as well bright. I figure it was the morning star.

The next morning I realize it was a airplane. looked like jupiter in the winter mornings and it was high in the western skies. And I didn't see it the next night.

I'm sorry this is all the information I can give you. But the time I had a small telescope.

I have been watching the skies at times. But I haven't seen anything as spectacular as that any thing I see as soon as possible.
