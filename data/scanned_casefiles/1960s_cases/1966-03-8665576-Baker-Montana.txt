The text appears to describe an observation on Friday, 25 March 1966 at about a certain time, with details about an object's movement, location, and appearance. The writing discusses the object's orbit, direction, and some characteristics like its visibility and movement. The text mentions the night being very dark, and discusses some observations about the object's form and movement.
