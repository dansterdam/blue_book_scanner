The image does not contain a photograph. The text in the document appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire, providing details about a sighting or observation. The text describes various details such as the date, time, and location of the sighting, as well as the witness's observations and impressions.

Here is the text from the document, as transcribed by the OCR system:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 31 March 1964

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 
Bright-light in sky about 6:00 P.M. Extremely bright light, about the size of my thumb nail at arms length. It was moving at fantastic speed to the east and suddenly just disappeared. There was no sound and no trail. The light was very bright and seemed to be about one-third the size of the full moon. It was not a meteor or any known aircraft or satellite. I have observed many aircraft and satellites in the night sky and this was quite different. The light came from the south and was high in the sky when I first observed it. It moved very rapidly across the sky and then just suddenly winked out. There was no gradual dimming or fading just a sudden disappearance. I was very impressed with the extremely high speed and the unusual behavior of the light. I could not find any rational explanation for what I saw. I reported this sighting to the local Air Force base and they indicated they had received several similar reports. Although they did not deny the reality of the sighting, they did not offer any explanation.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or your statement explanation of your sighting:

At 14/10 z at Miles City Airport, Montana, the mile city sheriff and a Mr. (name redacted) saw a large dark shaped object with bright lights shining over the airport as it hovered approx. 3-4 min then departed in a SSE heading. This was all the information reported. There is nothing more.

O.D. took call

8. Remarks re reports of special incidents if any, are listed be-
low: (extract of operations, instance of contact, sightings, etc, which
are necessary- 13 MAR 66: The USAF Command Pit called to relay a UFO sighting.
That was relayed to the SAC Command but there was not enough data to
conclusively classify the incident. No further action taken. 9 APRIL 66: The Miles City Sheriff and a local citizen saw a large
object square with lights on it, hovering low over the ranch area about
3-4 min. they considered it to be a 55 ft. diameter. This is all the information available.)

10. 6715 hours, relieved from duty, turned in report and

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 0930 - Object was sighted for about 30 seconds and then appeared to disappear upwards at a very rapid rate of speed.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): YES Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: _______

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Rapidly moving and humming
b. Color Bright light, greenish white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Approximately 1/10 the width of my hand at arm's length covered the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do not attempt to show the direction the object was moving.

It seemed to be hovering or moving at a high rate of speed at a steady course or altitude. There were no sounds or exhaust trails observed. It seemed to be reflecting the sunlight but casting no shadow. It disappeared from view gradually rather than suddenly.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.
90°    75°
           60°
               45°
