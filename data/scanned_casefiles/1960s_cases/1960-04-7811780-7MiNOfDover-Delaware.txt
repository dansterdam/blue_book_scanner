REPLY TO
ATTN OF: PLN
SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: ATIC (AFOSR)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Reference our message PLN 11-D-15, dated 11 April 1960 and your message AUIN-1522-1243-3. The following constitutes an amendment report based on a reinvestigation and interrogation of Mr. [redacted]. The impressions of both observers were essentially the same. Slight differences are indicated in parentheses.

a. Description of the object:

(1) The object consisted of a cluster of three lights. The first, in direction of movement toward the horizon, was large and bright yellow, identified as "A". The second and third were small, close together and will be identified as "B" and "C".

(2) The entire cluster was the size of a quarter held at arm's length. Initially, "A" was the size of a pea, "B" and the size of a pinhead; the distance between "A" and "B", the size of a pea; total size of "B" and "C" were the size of a pea. "B" and "C" were hazy in size and shape.

(3) "A" was bright yellow, no tail. "B" and "C" yellow, lesser magnitude, hazy, no tail.

(4) Three.

(5) Three in trail; "B" and "C" following "A", one diameter of "A" behind; slightly behind and to the right of "B".

(6) None.

(7) No tail or trail.

(8) Observers stated that they heard a faint whistle, one second duration. Upon reinterrogation, it was determined that the car was moving slowly in a 90 degree right turn, north to east at night with the windows closed. Relative weight of this statement should be judged accordingly.

Here is the text from the document:

(9) None.

b. Description of Course of Object:

(1) Airman first noticed a bright moving object through the top of a broad windshield.

(2) Elevation of 30 degrees, azimuth 350 degrees.

(3) Disappeared below the horizon at an azimuth of 350 degrees.

(4) Airman stated the object fell vertically toward the horizon. (Schofield stated the object fell in a straight path, but moving 15 degrees to the left). The rear stated the object first was a passenger and was oriented outside the car lenses weight to his statement. He could easily receive the impression that the object was moving to the left.

(5) Disappeared below the horizon.

(6) Stated 7-10 seconds, and he saw the object first and called Schofield's attention to it. States he saw the object for approximately one second.

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground visual, nighttime, in an automobile, windows closed, in a 90 degree right turn.

(2) None.

(3) N/A.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) 0310Z, 10 April 1960.
(2) Night.

e. Location of Observer: 7 miles north of Dover, Delaware, one-half mile east of DuPont Highway 13.

f. Identifying Information on Observer:
(1) Squadron, Dover AFB, Del., Personnel Specialist, 98th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Reliability unknown.

(2) age 30, Route 1, Dover, Del., occupation, service station attendant, professional plumber, reliability unknown.

6. Weather and Winds - Aloft Conditions at Time and Place of Sighting:

(1) Clear, winds northwest at 6 miles per hour.

(2) Surface 320/6, 6,000 320/14, 10,000 350/30, 16,000 350/40, 20,000 350/50, 30,000 340/40, 50,000 280/50, 60,000 270/25.

(3) None.

(4) 10 miles.

(5) None.

(6) None.

i. None

j. None

k. Initial Report was taken by 1st Lt James B. Dart, Officer-of-the-Day, from Area Airman Van Dyke. Airman Van Dyke was contacted by phone the next day by T/Sgt William Barnes, Intelligence Specialist.

Hq 1507th Air Transport Wing, who received essentially the same information as the QP's report. On 18 April Airman Van Dyke was reinterrogated by Maj Stanley J. Ash, Wing Plans Staff Officer, and Capt Robert A. Shaw, Wing Intelligence Officer. The major change as a result of this interrogation was the explanation of measurement credible which resulted in a more accurate determination of size, shape, elevation and azimuth.

18 April, with only the slightly variations in the report as referenced above. The best conclusion is that Airman made an actual observation of sufficient length and intensity to justify a report. Airman it called to his attention, and because of this delay and the fact that he was driving, he got only a fleeting glimpse of the object. Airman notes the sighting to a meteor only because he is positive it was not one by reason of its size, intensity, lack of speed and disappearance below the horizon. It is considered that all possible information available to this headquarters has been obtained and that no further investigation at this level is warranted.
