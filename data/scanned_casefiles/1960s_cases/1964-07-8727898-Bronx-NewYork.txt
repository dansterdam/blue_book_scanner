Moorland sighting

This letter was printed in the Scottish Daily Record of July 25: "Returning from holiday about 1 a.m. on Tuesday, July 23rd, my wife and I saw a bright object approaching us from the north. We thought it was a plane at first but as it came level with us I could see it had no tail, no navigation lights and no nose.

"It was aglow with lights that seemed to shine from the inside. It also had about four or five windows.

The whole thing took place on the moors between Rochester and Jedburgh and I'm wondering if we were the only ones to see it. I am now convinced that what we saw was a flying saucer." — William Elack, 116 McCracken Drive, Viewpark, Uddingston.

Sir:

I note your memorandum concerning an incident happening on July 25, 1966. Since that time I have read many articles dealing with UFO and their investigation. I would like the Air Force get more details and get some from old employees, that could be some application for some of these unusual happenings.

It is my judgment that many systems are very unbelievable. The report I sent to the Blue Book was very slight on my part. Since the July 5 sighting, I have made a mutual photographic of I.D. but I hesitate the word at because, I admit I would want to have a reply. I regret that there are people to report unusual sightings as retards they seem to get an official reply.

I would like to prepare my part and place yours an application what of how we can viewing one at it will give you a reply for me to send from you it will...

1. Reference your letter of 29 December 1966 regarding your most unusual observation. Due to the heavy workload for the past few months, this is the first opportunity we have had to reply. We try to answer as many people as possible but at times a backlog of correspondence arises and makes this somewhat difficult.

2. We have studied the submitted information and have found no plausible explanation for your observation. There were no similar reports in the area that were reported to the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB. Your case is being carried in Air Force files as UNIDENTIFIED.

3. The Air Force would appreciate your forwarding the original negative in order that we may perform a photo analysis on your photograph of an unidentified object. We will return the negative along with one print to you upon completion of analysis. The following camera data is necessary in attempting to make an evaluation:

a. Type and make of camera.
b. Type, focal length, and make of lens.
c. Brand and type of film.
d. Shutter speed used.
e. Lens opening used; that is, "f" stop.
f. Filters used.
g. Was tripod or solid stand used.
h. Was "panning" used.


- page 13 -

1. Exact direction camera was pointing with relation to true North, and its angle with respect to the ground.

2. If supplemental information is unobtainable, the minimum camera data required are the type of camera, and the smallest and largest "f" stop and shutter speed readings of the camera.

4. Request you complete the attached FTD Form 164, on your latest UFO observation, and return it in the envelope provided.

Dear Miss [redacted]

This is in reply to your letter of August 13, 1964, with further reference to your observation of several satellites during the past weeks.

From the information in your letter, we have determined that you observed Echo II on each evening mentioned, with the possible exception of August 9th when the time listed was 9:05 p.m., and our records indicate passage of Echo II at approximately 9:15 p.m. It may be that you observed a high-flying aircraft on that evening, although Echo II was west of New York City that night, which corresponds to your direction of sighting, while on July 25th, July 30th, and July 31st, it was north of the city.

For the next few days, Echo II will be seen in the early morning hours over New York; however, Echo I may be seen passing over your area between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. during the next week.

Sincerely,
