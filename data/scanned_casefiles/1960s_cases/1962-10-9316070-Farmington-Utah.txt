The object was trailing what appeared to be a gray or silver twine or cobwebbing with two knots trailing behind the object. The object after passing over his blind swerved to the southeast and accelerated to a tremendous speed and disappeared within 1 or 2 seconds. "Object was visible for approximately 20 seconds."

14k     The preparing officer is a Security Specialist, GS-7, Security and
Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah. Preliminary analysis indicates that
the observer interviewed was a logical nature person and was convinced that
he observed some tangible object, not identifiable as conventional aircraft.
No unusual meteorological or astronomical conditions were present which would
furnish an explanation for the sighting. No missile test findings are conducive
in the immediate area. With the compilation of this initial report, no explanation
has been developed for the object. No further action contemplated this station,
