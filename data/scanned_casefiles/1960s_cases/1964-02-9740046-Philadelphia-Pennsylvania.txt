Transcription of the text in the document:

17. There is no information on the object we have observed that we think could be of interest in determining what it may have been.

18. It is our impression to discount this incident as being anything other than a natural phenomenon.

19. When the Air Force Board received the report our action was to get the details filled in and make the report as complete as possible. 

20. Toward the end of the investigation, the object was identified as an aircraft of some kind, probably a commercial airliner. This seems to be the most plausible explanation.

21. No other unusual activity or sightings were reported in the area at the time. There are no other witnesses.

22. In view of the information obtained, the details indicate this was most likely a misidentified aircraft. The source appears to be reliable, but the evidence does not support the conclusion that this was an unidentified flying object.

23. There is no evidence to suggest any investigative interest or unusual situation associated with this report.

24. This appears to be a routine incident, with the information provided indicating this was likely a misidentified aircraft. There is no indication of any unusual activity or phenomenon.

25. How many more must go "unsolved" before the Air Force becomes convinced they cannot explain a good percentage of UFO reports?

26. It is our opinion that the report should be considered closed as a misidentified aircraft.

27. For many years nothing more advanced or unusual has been observed.

Dear Mr. ______,

This is in response to your recent letter requesting information on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

This office, which has the primary responsibility for investigating the subject of unidentified flying objects, does not have a clerical staff or sufficient size to permit our concerning into prolonged discussions with individuals other than bona fide scientific researchers.

It is recommended that you obtain a copy of "The Report of Flying Saucers" by Major Donald E. Keyhoe. This book has recently been published by Doubleday. It may help to clarify some of your queries on this subject.

Sincerely,

Text transcription:

If the Christian world found out people who have visited us from outer space, certainly most of them would turn to God for the answers. But it is still a matter for speculation and confusion for all of us. 

16. Do you from your experience confirm the not christians and people who would entirely reject altogether the messages and revelations?

I think that the men who believe and know would not talk at all to avoid criticism. They would only make statements to their families and close friends for fear of ridicule and just to protect themselves. 

2. I hope this is not true. Martians (sic) seem very gentle going (sic) and scientific men.

3. I don't think they are known. Don't people say that visitors did not behave as normal human visitors do? 

4. This is the most startling question. Do the visitors give any clue as to their origins? Do they come from Earth? or from outer space? 

17. If the visitors to us are so advanced technologically, do you think they would have solved the problem of overcoming great distances or time intervals involved in space travel?

18. I am sure you would have some good thoughts on this. What do you think their motives might be in visiting us?

BAP-OIPB/K. 'wells'/2630/19 Mar 53
MARCH 19, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

The Office of the President has asked the Air Force to reply to your letter.

There is no truth to allegations that the Air Force maintains unidentified personnel (flying saucers) who function as a reconnaissance or investigation group. 

All investigations of unidentified flying objects and similar phenomena are conducted by the scientific staff of Project Blue Book, the official Air Force program for the collection, evaluation, and analysis of information on unidentified flying objects. Individuals are assigned to support this program on a part-time basis as required and are not maintained as a special investigative force.

As of this date, no indications of a technological break-through to the extent claimed have been discovered by the Air Force scientific investigations. There has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force which would substantiate the existence of vehicles under intelligent control from outside the range of present scientific knowledge.

Your interest in Air Force activities is appreciated.

Sincerely,

C. R. CARLSON

PRODUCED FROM OCR:

I wrote a response called The Incident of February 9, 1964 in Philadelphia, PA. The writer describes an incident where they observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Philadelphia on the evening of February 9, 1964. The object was described as a large, circular, luminous object that moved slowly across the sky, changing color from white to red. The writer indicates that the object was seen by multiple witnesses and that they attempted to notify the authorities, but were unable to reach anyone. The writer states that they are submitting this report to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

OCR Text:

The light appeared to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was hovering approximately 30 to 40 feet above the ground. It was a very bright light, possibly incandescent, and could be observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The light suddenly accelerated in a horizontal direction and disappeared from view in approximately 1 or 2 seconds. The object was observed by several people who were gathered in the area and they all described the object in a similar manner. No sound was heard during the observation of the object. The sky was clear and visibility was good at the time of the incident. The object was not identified and there was no explanation for the phenomenon observed.

Lieutenant,

Report of sighting of unidentified flying object:

On November 23, 1963, at approximately 2:49 a.m., I observed an unidentified flying object in the eastern sky over Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The object was observed for approximately one minute. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was emitting a bright light. The object moved in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed, and then accelerated and disappeared from sight.

I would like to request that this report be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Project Blue Book, the designation for the U.S. Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), was in operation from 1952 to 1969.

Transcription of the text in the document:

The more strange and more unusual Phenomena come to my attention the more I'm convinced that we are dealing with extremely complex and possibly very significant matters. The technical sophistication implied by some of these sightings is quite remarkable. It seems unwise to simply dismiss or ignore these matters on the grounds that they don't fit our preconceived notions or conventional explanations. There is surely much more here than meets the eye.

I would urge that we keep an open mind and continue to investigate these matters as thoroughly and objectively as possible. We may well be on the threshold of major discoveries.

The text from the document is as follows:

"To the above report, Director, C.I.A.

1. Regarding the home construction work mentioned in paragraph 1; this matter was brought to my attention by an official of your office during a conversation with me in 1956. The individual expressed an interest in the matter.

2. Do the photos mentioned indicate any evidence of construction for a possible underground installation or any indication of underground construction?

3. I do not have any kind of evidence to indicate that there has been any extensive underground construction in the area mentioned.

11. Brig. Gen. Douglas mentioned this case to me and classified it C.I.A.

12. As the former major who made the report, I am requesting information on any progress or conclusions on the evaluation of this case.

13. I do want to make only this point: I felt the matter was worth reporting because of the observations made. These do not appear to be the normal run of case in my experience.

15. May I ask if there has been any further interest and follow up on this case by your office, or was it dropped?

16. The matter came to my attention in an unusual way, and I felt it deserved an official report and evaluation from your office."
