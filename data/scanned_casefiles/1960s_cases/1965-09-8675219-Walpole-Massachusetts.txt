O1e

E. Walpole, Mass.
September 14, 1965

Dear Sir:

On the evening of September 4th around 10:30 P.M. I saw what appeared to be two satellites in orbit over Quincy, New Hampshire. These two objects were traveling slowly (as a satellite would) from West to East and were followed by a third same 45 minutes later.

On the evening of Sept 9th I saw something traveling from horizon to horizon at a terrific rate of speed (approx. 4 secs) and it was the most beautiful blue-green I've ever seen. (over Walpole, Mass.)

I know it wasn't my imagination as my husband saw these also.

Would you please explain some?

Sincerely,
Mrs.

E. Walpole, Mass.
