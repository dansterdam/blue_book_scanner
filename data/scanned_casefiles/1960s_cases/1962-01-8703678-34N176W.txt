   E                                              Possible sighting of satellite, size of pinhead at 06382 Echo was at 45°N, 174W. With only
                                                  ground. 42° above horizon heading N-E. Speed unknown.

11. COMMENTS
    One time given it is possible that object was Echo, however the easterly heading is inconsistent with this analysis. Evaluation of object is as a satellite. Echo not ruled out; however, easterly heading is more indicative of satellite with indication of nearer 30°.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

t it. sun, remaining in the sky for the
longest time after sunset. On Oct. 8 it will
be at greatest brilliance, with magnitude
minus 4.3, which is about 15 times as bright
as Sirius. Then it quickly disappear,
reaching inferior conjunction. Now, 12, but
it will quickly reapper in the morning sky,
as bright as it was before the conjunction.
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn move in orbits
larger than the earth's, so they can never
come to inferior conjunction. They are most
conspicuous at opposition, when they are
in the opposite direction from the sun.
Mars was out beyond the sun, in conjunction with it, on Dec. 14. Now it is gradually
coming into view in the morning sky, but
not until spring will it be at all prominent.
By the end of the year it will be conspicuous in the evening, with opposition on
Feb. 4, 1963.

Jupiter is now out beyond the sun, with
conjunction Feb. 8. By late spring it will
move into the evening sky, opposition arriving Aug. 31. Saturn will be at conjunction
on Jan. 22, with opposition July 31.

Thus, by next fall we will have a fine
display of planets, with Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn all visible.

The new year will also bring two eclipses
of the sun. The first, on Feb. 4 and 5 is
total. Along a belt crossing the Pacific
Ocean, from New Guinea to a point about
a thousand miles west of Lower California,
the sun will be completely covered by the
moon for as long as four minutes. Over a
larger area, including the west coast of
North America, a partial eclipse will be seen.

On July 31, there will be an another
eclipse. That is, the moon will come in front
of the sun but will not over it. A ring
of the solar surface appears around the dark
disc of the moon. This effect will be visible
along a path from Brazil, crossing the South
Atlantic, then traversing Africa and Madagascar. All of Africa, most of South America and Florida and Georgia in the U.S.
will see a partial eclipse.
