23 AUG 65

9 December 1965

Mrs Hunt/gh/SAFOICC/7284-2/9 Dec 65

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your report of two aerial objects which you were unable to identify on 23 August 1965.

It is possible that you observed two of the satellites, satellite components, or space debris which are visible to the naked eye. Since the objects were on the same course, it is also possible that two high flying aircraft were observed.

Thank you for reporting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

L. FENDLEY, Lt. Colonel, USAF
