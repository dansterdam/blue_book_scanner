The text in the document is as follows:

2. Additional Comments: Immediately upon receipt of this assignment (1100 5 July) I contacted Mr. Donohue at the following address (6990 6 July), and made an appointment to see him the following morning. During the interview Mr. Donohue related details of the letter, Subject: U.F.O. Dated 30 June 1960, with only two minor deviations. One was the shape of the object as explained in paragraph 1 above. The other was the color of the two jet aircraft that flew over after the object vanished. I recorded this piece of data because it had bearing on the F-101 and/or F-102 aircraft that were airborne in the vicinity at the time. Mr. Donohue identified the aircraft that flew over as being either F-102's or F-106's. He stated that each entire aircraft was not red and blue in color, but rather one painted, one not red and blue, in color. This seems confusing, but there it is. According to the Mancom report, which appears to be based (also delta winged aircraft) with negative results. During a phone conversation with reports from McGuire AFB in New Jersey, other similar sittings were related, also checked with Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center to determine if they had any of the above type aircraft under their control at the time and was informed by M that they had no information on file to indicate the above type aircraft were under their control. Information was negative.

3. Conclusion: Mr. Donohue is a mature male, 38 years old, with an impressive knowledge, for a layman, of today's fighter and bomber operational abilities and apparent lack of knowledge during World War II. He spoke in very accurate terms and recalled the details of the observance. I saw somethingâ€”an aircraft, balloon or optical illusion. For lack of any concrete evidence to support his claim, I must classify this observation as an "Unidentified Flying Object". I feel certain that the siting by Mr. Donohue was confidential and had no bearing on the area cited.

Commander, 32473d Air Base Wing, Hanscom Field, Bedford, Mass.
R. E. Dunlap, 232/Intelligence, Air Force, Commander and Cpt. George J. Hunt, 232/Intelligence, Air Force, Conducted an investigation of a report of an unidentified flying object which was received at this headquarters on 30 June 1960. It is mentioned that at 1325 hours, 30 June 1960, the witness, who is self-employed in the Hanscom Field area, reported that he had sighted what he believed was an unidentified flying object, or a strange celestial phenomenon.
It is stated that at approximately 1525 hours, 29 June 1960, the witness stated that he observed a bright object in the sky over Hanscom Field, Bedford, Mass. It was at the time he did not consider it unusual, but observed it as a strange celestial phenomenon. It is stated that the object was not disappoint when it did a 90 degree approximately ninety-second turn, and then accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. It is stated that the witness was unable to observe the object expecting to detect sunlight reflection from its surface, however after an initial observation period, the witness was surprised to find that the object just disappeared and was unable to determine its altitude or size or rate of speed. It is estimated that this particular object may have been traveling at a speed between 600-800 mph. It is mentioned that the witness was unable with the aid of any additional data to correlate the object with any astronomical or meteorological information. It is added that the sighting occurred directly over the Hanscom Field installation, and the weather was generally clear.

ATTN OF: (CWOE/Capt Mariconda/2648)	11 July 1960

SUBJECT: U. F. O.

TO:	Commander
3245 Operations Group
L.G. Hanscom Fld., Bedford, Mass.

1. In compliance with par 15 AFR 200-2, the following information is submitted with reference to the siting of a U. F. O. by Mr. at 1828, 29 June 1960.

Description of the Object:
1. Object was egg shaped. Mr. stated that the object appeared to be fuzzy or choppy on the outside which caused it to be egg shaped. For a lack of ability to describe it properly over the telephone he described it as round to Col Hunt in his original report.
2. Size appeared to be the size of a match head held at arms length.
3. Color: Upon first noticing the object Mr. said it was white in color then appeared metallic as it turned.
4. Only one object was seen.
5. No formation.
6. Object appeared to be above 50,000 feet but larger than a bomber would appear at that altitude. This conclusion was reached when I informed Mr. that our aircraft are generally above 30,000 feet when they make vapor trails. He stated he had seen many times and related how it was almost impossible to see the aircraft making them and felt that 50,000 feet was a reasonable estimate of the object's altitude.
7. No tail, trail or exhaust was seen.
8. No sound or noise was heard.
9. Speed was unusual, fast as compared to the relatively slow speed bombers appear to be moving when high enough to make vapor trails as observed by Mr. Estimated speed to be 1000 mph or better.

(above 20,000 ft)
4. Visibility 15 miles.
5. 6/10 to 9/10 of sky covered.
6. No thunderstorms or other unusual weather was present or forecast.

7. No unusual meteorological, astronomical or other activity was reported
that could account for the siting.
8. a check with Major Watson, the Senior Director of the Boston Air Defense
Sector, revealed that no unusual radar tracks were observed nor were any intercepts
made at the time, date and location of the reported object.
9. Due to the location of Wilmington, Mass., which is in the greater Boston
area and 13 miles N of Boston/Maguire AFB and about 8 miles from a high density air
traffic area it would be impossible to list the aircraft in the vicinity at the time. The
random presentation of this particular area is too cluttered to make identification of a
single target extremely difficult unless the radar observer was tracking a given target
or an unusually clear and distinct target appeared. Mr. Aldrich, Director of this area
for the RAF, who had the radar tapes analyzed by his technical people, confirmed in his
personnel reference to this object, of Robert T. Burns of the National Space Surveillance Center, that the object's radar return was not as definitive as was hoped.
10. According to information received the balloons burst at 1616 EST
(2116Z) after attaining an altitude of 110,000 ft. The wind direction and velocity
at the time was such that the balloons would have reached over the vicinity of Wilmington. The object was at one time 12" in diameter due to decreased atmospheric pressure,
and easily visible with the naked eye. The balloon collapsed and descended, breaking up into smaller fragments prior to the time mean or about 35 miles at Wilmington. This rapidity is estimated.
11. My position is Strike Control Officer assigned to the 3245 ACS&W Squadron
(Experimental). I am also a rated pilot. Considering the above listed statements and information I am unable to classify the object sighted by Mr.
R/A N/A
