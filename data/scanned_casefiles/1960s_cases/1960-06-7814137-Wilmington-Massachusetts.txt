10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object which appeared to be fuzzy on opposite sides which caused its appearance to be egg shaped, about the size of a match head. White in color when first seen, appeared metallic as it turned. Appeared to be above 50,000 ft, but lower than a bomber would appear at that altitude. No sound or trail. Estimated speed 1000 mph or better. Seemed to disappear moving skyward.

11. COMMENTS
Possible balloon sighting since balloon was released and appeared over Wilmington at 1957Z. Possible that time error resulted in reporting. Other characteristics point to balloon sighting with the exception of the speed of 1000 mph. Object appeared overhead and disappeared overhead, but direction not mentioned in report. Nine minutes is a normal time error. Case listed as possible balloon sighting.

2. Additional Comments: Immediately upon receipt of this assignment (1100 5 July) I contacted Mr. ███ home and made an appointment to see him the following morning (0900 6 July). During a two hour interview Mr. ███ related his observation to me exactly as it appeared in Major Stuart's letter. Subject: U. F. O., Dated 30 June 1960, with only two minor deviations.

One was the shape of the object as explained in paragraph 1a (1) above. The other was the color of the two jet aircraft that flew over after the object vanished. I escorted Mr. ███ to the flight line after he described the two jets as "looking like a piece of pie" where we viewed the F-101, F-102 and F-106. He identified the aircraft that flew over a being F-102's or F-106's which appear identical in flight. He added that each entire aircraft was not red and blue in color but rather the tails are painted, one red and one blue.

I made a stated that he arrested here at Hanscom Field in Newing the the ones he saw. I checked with So. Weymouth N.A.S. where the Douglas F4D-1 is based (also a delta winged aircraft) with negative results. During a phone conversation with the Base Operations Officer at McGuire AFB in New Jersey I found that none of the F-102's or F-106's based there are painted. I further checked with Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center to determine if they had any of the above type aircraft under their control at the time and was informed by Mr. ███ that they had no information on file to indicate the above type aircraft were under Boston Control at the time specified. I also contacted the 27th Fighter Squadron at Loring AFB Maine (F-102's) with negative results.

3. Conclusion: Mr. ███ is a mature male, 38 years old, with an impressive knowledge, for a layman, of today's fighter and bomber operational altitude and speeds. He was a "Sea Bee" during World War II. He spoke intelligently during our interview about many subjects. I feel he saw something-- an aircraft, balloon or optical illusion. For lack of any concrete evidence to support his claim I must classify his observation as an "Unidentified Flying Object". I feel certain that the siting by Mr. ███ of the two jets after the disappearance of the object was coincidental and had no bearing on the sited object.

Unidentified Flying Objects                                        30 June 1960

Commander, 3645th Air Base Wing, LG Hanscom Field, Bedford, Mass.

1. Confirming verbal notification of 29 June 1960, to Colonel George R. Hunt, DCS/Intelligence, Air Force Command and Control Development Division, and in accordance with Paragraph 4, AFR 200-2, as amended, be advised that at 1635 hours, 29 June 1960, Mr. Wilmington, Massachusetts, who is self-employed in the plumbing and heating business, telephonically reported that he had sighted what he believed was an unidentified flying object, or a "flying saucer."

2. Mr. _______ complained that at approximately 1625 hours, 29 June 1960, while seated in the yard of his property and looking skyward, he observed a dark, bell-shaped object flying at an extremely high altitude. At the time he did not consider it unusual, but observed it is it flew into a cloud. He kept watch for the object anticipating its exit from the cloud from the direction from which it had entered and was rewarded when in 11 or 12 after approximately thirty seconds, and has certain expectation scanning aircraft. In flight, he continued to observe the object expecting to detect sunlight reflection from its surface which could normally occur from flying aircraft. However, after watching the object for a full five minutes, he observed no reflection from its surfaces and was surprised to find that the object just disappeared. Although he was unable to estimate its altitude or rate of speed, he was advised that in the past he has seen USAF bombers flying in the area and estimated that the object flew three times faster than a bomber and insisted that it was clearly distinguishable although he was unable to furnish any additional descriptive information.

Concluded with the information that immediately after the object vanished, two swept-winged jets, one red and one blue, flew past at a much lower altitude. He added that the sighting occurred directly over his home in Wilmington, Massachusetts, and the weather was clear with high, scattered clouds.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: (CWOE/Capt Mariconda/2648)                11 July 1960

SUBJECT: U. F. O.

TO: Commander
     3245 Operations Group
     L G Hanscom Fld, Bedford, Mass.

1. In compliance with par 15 AFR 200-2 the following information is submitted with reference to the siting of an U.F.O. by Mr. ███████ on 16 1625, 29 June 1960.

a. Description of the Object:
     1. Object was egg shaped. Mr. ███████ stated that the object appeared to be fuzzy on opposite sides which caused its appearance to be egg shaped. For a lack of ability to describe it properly over the telephone he described it as round to Col Hundt in his original report.

     2. Size appeared to be the size of a match head held at arms length.

     3. Color: Upon first noticing the object Mr. ███████ said it was white in color then appeared metalic as it turned.

     4. Only one object was seen.

     5. No formation

     6. Object appeared to be above 50,000 feet but larger than a bomber would appear at that altitude. This conclusion was reached when I informed Mr. ███████ that our aircraft are generally above 30,000 feet when they make vapor trails. He stated he had seen vapor trails many times and related how it was almost impossible to see the aircraft making them and felt that 50,000 feet was a reasonable estimate of the object altitude.

     7. No tail, trail or exhaust was seen.

     8. No sound or noise was heard.

     9. Speed was unusually fast as compared to the relatively slow speed bombers appear to be moving when high enough to make vapor trails as observed by Mr. ███████. Estimated speed to be 1000 mpb or better.

3. Ceiling 3000 ft scattered variable broken with high broken
(above 20,000 ft)

4. Visibility 15 miles.

5. 6/10 to 9/10 of sky covered.

6. No thunderstorms or other unusual weather was present or forecast.

7. Temperature gradient: surface 80°F, 5000 ft /13°C, 10,000 ft /4°C,
15,000 ft -4°C, 20,000 ft -15°C, 25,000 ft -28°C, 30,000 ft -41°C, 35,000 ft -50°C,
40,000 ft -51°C, 45,000 ft -53°C, 50,000 ft -55°C.

h. No unusual meteorological, astronomical or other activity was reported
that could account for the siting.

i. A check with Major Watson, the Senior Director of the Boston Air Defense
Sector, revealed that no unusual radar tracks were observed nor were any intercepts
made at the time, date and place of the reported object.

j. Due to the location of Wilmington, Mass., which is in the greater Boston
area and almost at the junction of Airway Blue 4 and Airway Red 11 a high density air
traffic area it would be impossible to list the aircraft in the vicinity at the time. The
radar presentation of that particular area is too cluttered, making identification of a
single target extremely difficult unless the radar observer was tracking a given target
or an unusually fast target appeared. Mr Aldrich, Deputy Chief of the Boston Air
Traffic Control Center, revealed there were negative reports by pilots or his personnel in reference to this object. Lt Robert W Burns of the National Space Surveillance Control Center, revealed there were no satellites in a position to be observed at the date, time and place reported by Mr [illegible] Sgt Maggar, Test Engineering, this base, informed me that a weather balloon, oblong in shape 5' by
9' in size was released at 1443 EDST (1943). The balloon burst at 16,16 EDST
(2116Z) after attaining at altitude of 110,000 ft. The wind direction and velocity
at the time was such that the balloon would have passed over the vicinity of Wilmington at 1457 EDST (1957Z) at an altitude of 16,100 ft expanded to approximately
12' in diameter due to decreased atmospheric pressure, and easily visible with the
naked eye from Wilmington. The balloon collapsed nine minutes prior to the time
Mr [illegible] sighted the object and according to calculation the balloon fell in the
ocean or about 35 miles NE of Wilmington, so this possibility is eliminated.

k. My position is Strike Control Officer assigned to the 3245 ACW Squadron
(Exper.) I am also a rated Pilot. Considering the above listed statements and information I am unable to classify the object sighted by Mr [illegible].
