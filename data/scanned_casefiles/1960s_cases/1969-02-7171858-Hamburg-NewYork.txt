UFO OBSERVATION OF FEBRUARY 1968

Hamburg, New York 14075

Reference your letter of 13 October 1969. Enclosed is the negative to your UFO sighting of 7 February 1968. Photographic analysis of your negative revealed the following:

"Examination of the referenced photography revealed that the 'unidentified flying object' is probably a result of a multiple exposure or a flashing light source. The erratic pattern displayed is probably caused by camera motion/vibration."

Project Blue Book!
Dear Sirs:
I have often to you about the knowledge of Flying Saucers. In
about the middle of February 196B I unexpectedly caught a picture of a UFO on my
picture. I am an amatute astronomer and like to take pictures of stars which are
all time exposures. This one was taken at f/8.8 for about 2 minutes of some constellation which I do not remember. I would appreciate it if you could tell me
approximately what it is. My theory is that it could be a lightning picture but
if it is the one of the most startling over taken. To prove this there are as I
forgot to mention earlier star trails on the negative. Thank You.
Inclosed are **** four enlargements and
one contact print.

Sincerely yours,
