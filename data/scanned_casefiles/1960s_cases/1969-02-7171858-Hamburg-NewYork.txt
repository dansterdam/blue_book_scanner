UFO Observation of February 1968

Hamburg, New York 14075

Reference your letter of 13 October 1969. Enclosed is the negative to your UFO sighting of February 1968. Photographic analysis of your negative revealed the following:

"Examination of the referenced photography revealed that the 'unidentified flying object', referred to by the photographer as 'lightning', is probably a result of a multiple exposure of a flashing light source. The erratic pattern displayed is probably caused by camera motion/vibration."

Dear Sirs:

I have often to you about the knowledge of Flying Saucers. In about the middle of February 1968 I unexpectedly caught a picture of a UFO on my picture. I am an amateur astronomer and like to take pictures of stars which are all time exposures. This one was taken at f/3.8 for about 2 minutes of some constellation which I do not remember. I would appreciate it if you could tell me approximately what it is. My theory is that it could be a lightning picture but if it is it's one of the most startling ever taken. To prove this there are as I forgot to mention earlier star trails on the negative. Thank You.

Inclosed are four enlargements and
one contact print.

Sincerely yours,

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter postmarked December 14, 1968, in which you enclosed some photographic prints.

In order for us to evaluate a photograph, we must have the original negative (or original Polaroid print). If you care to send us the original negatives, we will have them analyzed. The following information will also be needed:

Type and make of camera
Type, focal length, and make of lens
Brand and type of film
Shutter speed used
Lens opening used, that is, "f" stop
Filter used, if any
Was tripod or solid stand used
Was "panning" used
Exact direction camera was pointed with relation to true North, and its angle with respect to the ground

If all of the above information is not available, minimum requirements are type of camera, and smallest and largest "f" stops and shutter speed readings of the camera.

The prints you sent us are enclosed.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN

Dear Major Aikman:

On December 14, 1968 I sent you some photographs of something which I do not know. I received back a request of information that you wanted in regard to this photograph. This I sent immediately to your headquarters and I am still waiting for a reply. I said in this letter that I would like my negative back as soon as possible and I would appreciate this request most urgently as I need it. It has been almost 3 months since I have sent it and I have been wondering if something has happened to it. Please send it as soon as possible along with your reports if any. Thank you for your time and trouble.

Yours sincerely,

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order 69-44 submitted by Lieutenant Colonel
Quintanilla, TEPP(UFO) requesting photo analysis be accomplished on a photograph of an
"unidentified flying object" to determine what the object may be. The photograph was taken
in Hamburg, New York in February 1958.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the referenced photography revealed that the "unidentified
flying object", referred to by the photographer as "lightning", is probably a result of a
multiple exposure of a flashing light source. The erratic pattern displayed is probably
caused by camera motion/vibration.
