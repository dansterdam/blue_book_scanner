6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
GROUND -VISUAL

COMMENTS: The observer wrote that "We have seen lights like stars, but not like stars before. They are brighter than stars, appear at random in different parts of the sky." For the past two summers the observers family and his uncles family have been seeing lights around their farms. Since all the sightings are of point lights there is little change of identifying the stimulus. Some may be caused by hot air balloons, aircraft, satellites, and stars and planets. Also since the sightings are of point light sources they do not meet the definition of a UFO as given in AFR 80-17 and as such are carried as Insuff. Data.

Gentlemen:

When you read what is in this letter, please keep in mind that I am neither a crackpot or eccentric, nor a practical joker. I am merely a citizen who is concerned about what is happening in the skies of our nation, and I am interested in finding out what is going on.

For the past two summers members of my family and my uncle's family have been seeing "lights" in the skies around our farms. Last summer my aunt and her two small children saw a light over the trees behind their barn, a very bright light that got alternatively brighter and then dimmer and remained stationary for several hours. My aunt did not go to the barn since it was night and she and the children were alone (my uncle had gone to work). She told us about it and we thought it was funny.

Last summer I was at the other farm feeding the dogs. I finished, got in the car, and proceeded to make a turn. In the middle of the turn I saw a peculiar light in the sky towards the direction of Jeffersonville. It was like a star, but something told me it wasn't a star, it just didn't look right. I stopped the car, let the headlights burn, and the light went out like someone would switch out an electric light in the house. It didn't temporarily disappear from view or twinkle like a star will do, it just disappeared. Later I remembered that the light would have been just about over the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant at Charlestown.

Nothing more unusual than that was seen by me last summer, but this summer I and others have seen other, more strange things. A couple of weeks ago, my mother and I were sitting outside in a car talking, when I saw a light, that peculiar sort of star, but not a star, in the extreme southwestern sky. The light was moving, but it was not a plane because erratically, in a sidewise-forward-and-backwards motion. As it rocked along, it got alternatively brighter and dimmer, and it eventually proceeded toward the south (the direction of the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant). We, my mother and I, could hear no jet or piston motors; there was no sound. When over the camp plant it appeared to go so low on the horizon that we couldn't keep sight of it any longer. We then saw a red light that was blinking regularly on-and-off and coming from the direction of the ammo plant towards us. I told my mother the first light we had seen could not have been a plane, since a plane was coming towards us and the difference could readily be seen. But then we lost

sight of the "airplane," and we listened for the sound of its
motors, which we would have by then heard directly over us.
There was nothing. We knew then that neither of the lights
had been airplanes. Once we thought that the first light might
have been a helicopter, but we dismissed this guess, since why
would a helicopter be flying at night over the camp plain with
his light off part of the time? Surely he could have seen more
during the day and not had the safety risk that he had without
his light in continuous use.

My brother and I have seen from our bedroom window a "star"
which would come from a higher region of the sky in a "waterfall"
or "staircase" pattern, go back to the higher sky region, and
continue the sideways, zig-zag, staircase pattern of movement
for an extended period of time.

Last Friday night, the 6th, my 13-year-old sister came running
from her bedroom about 11:30 to tell me that she had just
seen one of those lights in the sky. We looked out the back
door, (she and I, the others had already gone to bed,) and we
saw one of the "stars" which are not stars. They look so much
like stars that, unless you have seen them before, you would
never pay them any attention, unless they started to move. Once
you have seen one moving, in the sky and careering, you can easily
pick out the 'suspect' stars for observation. The light was bright
enough that we could watch it easily even though it was in the
same region of the sky that our pole light is in. The light
moved back-and-forward for a few minutes until it "blinked out"
and disappeared.

Saturday night, my sister again saw one of those lights in the
sky. This time it did not move, but we had seen them before
and we recognized it as one of the strange kind. We did not
keep a close watch on the object, and after about an hour and
a half I went back for another look ( I had been there during
a few checks during the hour and a half, but we did not check
very often). When I looked again after the hour and a half,
the "star" was gone.

I am beginning to be concerned about this matter, since there
are a number of things in this general area that may be very
interesting to someone: the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant at
Charlestown, the Public Service Company of Indiana electric
generating plant at New Albany, the McAlpine dam and Locks at
Louisville, the Jefferson Proving Grounds (for artillery shells)
at Madison, and the electric generating plant at
Madison (whose heavy power lines pass through our fields not
far from our house, in fact the light of Sept. 7 was just about
over the extended power lines in the distance several miles),
to name a few.

I am of the opinion that a discreet investigation is in order.
I and some of the members of our two families would like to
know something about what this can and does mean, and what the
government is prepared to do about it.

Signed,

It was a distant point of bright light moving towards the Indiana Arsenal. Irregular both at flight. Brighter & then dimmer. Went out for varying intervals & came back on again. 1st. 7 sighting was stationary in the distance over power transmission lines (several hundred feet above). Appeared to have alternating & flashing lights on top. Very visible for 2 hours, then completely gone.
