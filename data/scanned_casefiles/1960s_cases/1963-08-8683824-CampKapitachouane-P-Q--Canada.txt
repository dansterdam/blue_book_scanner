10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj rising in South passing overhead to North. Resembled ECHO except speed much faster.

11. COMMENTS
Object faster than ECHO would indicate a duration and motion consistent with analysis is an a/c, possibly a high altitude jet. Nothing to indicate that this was other than a misinterpretation of an a/c in flight.

Dear Sir,

As I spend every summer here in Canada on Lake Chewel near Lake Kapitachouane, I have a very good chance to do a little star gazing. We had a perfect view of the total eclipse. The past two summers I have enjoyed watching Echo go over and was looking for it last night - about 10 o'clock.

Daylight Saving Time, when I notice a light rise rapidly in the South and climb up over my head & disappear in the North. How this light resembled Echo except it traveled much faster and followed a different path. Echo seemed to come up slowly almost the same spot that traveled across the sky very slowly finally sinking in the horizon. Could you tell me what
