Dear Jesse

As my wife and I were watching a movie machine in theater, it was going South at about a 45 degree angle as viewed a light. The color of the stars moving from a westerly direction to a easterly direction about the size of actor it moved on but a short Southwest line to a westward point. I presume out of the same range of atmosphere. Looked at watch, color was almost a turned around it came back a little higher in the sky. I first thought it was echo as it was about its sign might bigger I at appeared to wave as wobble as it went up when it turned & came back. I then presumed it was a controlled space craft of some sort. If it had been a jet about high you could not have made a jet height. This was on Aug 14, 61 at about 11:30 day light saving time. I have always though we have some strong ideas that are you too, wonder it might help not to know about life just when we are
