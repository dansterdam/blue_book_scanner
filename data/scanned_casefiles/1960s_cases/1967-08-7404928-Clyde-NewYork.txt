Observer sighted an object that had 3 or 4 huge red lights on the bottom. There also seemed to be some amber light in the middle, on the top there were six or less blue lights that were not blinking.

Comments: The observer said that the town policeman also saw this object. The witness was contacted but reported that he had not seen any UFO's on the date in question. He did see UFO's on two other occasions but the observer of this case was not listed as a witness to either of these sightings. Because of the very poor quality of the photos, it was not felt necessary to submit them to the photo experts.

Sighting on Rte 13. Stood up as just one bright Red Light after watching it. It broke into smaller objects. Reddish light appeared in most of the longer one. This time the large light dimmed down and disappeared. While the less smaller ones was out on field appeared and while the first one to appear was out nearly after dimming. Then the first one to appear. This was only to be in sight for few seconds.

At first made me think a plane was on fire. I went home and got my Binoculars, but by that time there was nothing in the sky. This was traveling about 12 miles an hour. At 20:30 some date this object appeared again. At 21 then the village. I was about 1000 - 1500 ft away from at 31 when I spotted this.

There was a short's easy traveling about 20-25 miles with this object 50 ft north of it and it'd say 5th pos. it about it. Before I could pick up the two-way radio and have them check what was above them the lights all went out and they didn't appear again. This object was moving the same speed as the short's and had the light stayed on the three blue on the bottom spread about 20-25 ft apart. This looked like 60 six object as there was no still thing or other.

Dear Major:

I know that you are a busy man and must get a great deal of mail about UFO sightings, but since there are such things that I have seen, there are several other persons that have seen them. Let me tell you one of the incidents: the town cop and I were having a talk and he told me about the sighting that he has seen (he works 12 to 4 a.m. shift). So one night I went behind the school and was looking up in the sky when I thought was a airplane turned out to be something that I have never seen before. It came floating; these were the air and then stopped. I saw either three or four huge red lights on the bottom of the object. These seemed to be some amber light in the middle, on the top there were six or less blue lights that were not blinking.

Sir, I took off out of that parking lot like the end of the world was behind me and I was trying to beat it. I went straight downtown about 85-90 m.p.h., slammed on the brakes in front of the park, looked up and saw it was over the bank, then I turned to see if I could get a witness, ask no one looked up, saw it was above Lock Street, which is two blocks from where I was, then the cop spotted the heading towards Lyons.

About one week before this incident behind the school this West Genesee Street was headed down West Genesee in a westerly direction. The Sheriff was headed east on West Genesee Street, when the village cop spotted the object, 2000-3000 feet above the center and approximately 500 feet to the left.) In the first part of this letter I have described an object I have seen behind the school. The village cop who described his object the same as I have before this.

The following diagrams that are enclosed in this letter are of the object seen behind the school and seen by the village cop.

I have some snapshots of the object but they have to be enlarged so you can see them clearly. Please send me some additional data on the people across the nation by letter to you. I would like the details of the people. If you are interested in seeing these pictures you may, to have seen. If you are to blow up. Send a request for them. I will gladly send them to you but I would like to have them after you have finished.
