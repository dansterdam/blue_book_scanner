OBSERVER IS A PHYSICIAN AND DOES NOT APPEAR GIVEN TO FLIGHTS OF
FANCY. HE STATED THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THE SIGHTING WAS ECHO 1;
HOWEVER, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASS IN-
FORMED US THAT ECHO 1 WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE AT THIS LATITUDE
AT @213Z AND WOULD HAVE APPEARED IN THE SOUTHEAST AND WOULD
HAVE BEEN TRAVELING SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AT AN ALTITUDE OF 87 DEGREE.

DR [ILLEGIBLE] STATES THAT OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SHINING BY REFLECTED
LIGHT SINCE IT WAS BRIGHTER AT FIRST SIGHT AND APPEARED TO GROW
SOMEWHAT DIMMER LATER, NO CONCLUSION AS TO NATURE OF SIGHTING.

L.     NONE.
