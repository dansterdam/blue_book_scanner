PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 4 Aug 66   5/0430Z
2. LOCATION: Holly, Michigan
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one-three
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15-20 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: Westward
8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes   [X] No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes   [X] No

10. CONCLUSION: Aircraft (possible) ✓ Air refueling track Water Clock (AR-206) is over the area.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched three then one object slowly travel toward the western sky. The object was round to crescent toward the observer, who was high up in an open area. It soon changed to a larger, brighter object. It soon changed color from white to red, Saturn. The object pulsated white to red; however, after a while it was the color that Saturn is, a yellowish color. There are two minor discrepancies in the story, and the time of the sighting and if the object was in constant sight.

AR-206 is over the area. It appears from the description that a possible aircraft observation was a possible for the sighting. At such a late date air activity records have been destroyed.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   30     November     1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

At 11:30 I was awaken and told about the sighting. They told me they saw three objects come down from the sky (coming down I mean going towards the horizon) and one stopped. The other two flew off. They knew I liked Astronomy and asked and one came to me. I hesitated because I thought it was a practical joke. However, they were telling the truth. In the sky about 20 or 25 degrees above the horizon it was rather small at first and seemed to be disappearing rapidly. However it changed and it became brighter. It seemed to pulsate in size. But when it became bright it stopped pulsating. It seemed to be flat yellow with a star. However it was good deal larger that a star about twice as large or about 1½ the size of Saturn. I stopped looking at it in about five minutes. I talked with someone of Ireland I came back in a few minutes to notice that it had moved a great deal down and was dim. I also remember the first time was going over the constellations and their relation possible dampness in the air. However there wasn't a halo around the moon.

I just figured out a way to tell you in more exactness when the object was sighted. I drew just after the sighting some pictures of the constellations and their relation to the object. By using a star chart I found that about 10:00 PM the big Dipper was in the west, where it is shown in the drawing which am going to supply. I will supply the original first, then make a much more detailed one drawing the bright stars and where they were.

Dear Sirs:

I sent in a UFO report about four months ago. The sighting took place near Holly, Michigan on August 4, 1966. I would like to know the results of your investigation. Have you received another report from the same place? I hope that you answer this letter since I believe that what I saw could be identified.

Sincerely yours,

UFO Observation, 4 Aug 66

1. Reference your recent correspondence requesting the Air Force evaluation of your 4 August 1966 observation. Detailed investigation did not reveal a positive identification; however, we believe you could have possibly observed an aircraft refueling mission. The description of your observation is similar to that description often reported for such aircraft activity.

There was an air refueling track over the area of the sightings; however, sir activity records are normally destroyed after thirty days, thus preventing actual verification of aircraft being there at the time of your sighting.

2. There were no additional reports from your area at the time of your sightings. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Sir;

On August 4, 1966 I saw a UFO. However I think I saw a very common phenomenon, but what? I would like it if you send me a UFO form so that you might know and I might know what I saw. It could have been something strange but I doubt it. Also could you tell me if another reports came in about that same date that my sighting took place?

Sincerely,

My friends saw three objects fly down from where the moon was. One object stopped. I was awaken to itself. You would have to place one and half Saturns in the sky when it was its largest and when it disappeared from sight you need to place about a fourth magnitude star.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object I saw did disappear. It seemed to get very large (one-half Saturns in size) and then it moved down toward the horizon. It then stopped just above the horizon and faded out of sight. No objects my friends saw flew out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   [No]   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   [No]   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound   -has no sound-
b. Color   -It pulsated white to red. However after awhile it was the color that Saturn is, a yellowish color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
It would cover the object completely, I think.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

What I saw:
It stopped for awhile and then moved down to the horizon when it stopped again and faded to a very very dim star. The speed it moved like was like a planet moving a twice as fast as it does.

My friends said they saw it come from the area of the moon there were three of them. One stopped, the one I saw.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Three, I saw one of them. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The page contains a compass diagram and two sketching areas for documenting the observed object(s) trajectory and positioning.
