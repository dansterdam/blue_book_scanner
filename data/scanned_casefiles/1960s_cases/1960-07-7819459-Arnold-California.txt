Extract in Letter to the Honorable Richard B. Russell did 4 August 1960.

With specific reference to your inquiry concerning the alleged UFO which fell at Atlanta, Georgia, inquiry reveals that, on 25 July 1960, at 6:00 p.m., a practice bomb fell from the skies and landed on the grounds of the Atlanta Federal Prison Farm. No injuries or damage to property were incurred other than a hole in the ground which was 11 inches in diameter. The incident was investigated by Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel from Fort McPherson, Dobbins and Robins Air Force Bases, Georgia. Fragments of the bomb were recovered which contained stock numbers and a manufacturers name and which were identified as being a portion of an MA-1 Spotting Charge. The investigators dug 35 feet to the bottom of the hole and recovered an MB-1 Practice Bomb.

Since this incident was reported through Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel rather than through UFO channels, it was never considered a UFO and no UFO report, as such, was ever rendered.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

On 4 August 1960 you requested the latest information concerning unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

There is no authenticated evidence to prove or even indicate that UFOs are space craft after another planet. They are superior devices under intelligent control or that they constitute a direct physical threat to the country. There are no facts which tend to prove that UFOs are space craft or superior devices under intelligent control being controlled by the Force from the public to the press. Furthermore, there have been no classified UFO reports which have not been made available to Congress.

By an act of Congress, the United States Air Force is charged with the air defense of the United States. In connection with this vitally important mission, the Air Force must, in fact, intercept, identify, and destroy, if necessary, any aircraft, missile, or object in aerospace which threatens the security of the United States. In the performance of this mission, we have had or are using numerous types of aircraft, radar, and missiles tracking devices, and we have been unable to discover any advance indications that it is constitutes a threat to the national security of the United States. However, it would be sound in numerous occasions that UFO reports reported on radar and/or visually by credible observers. In the interest of national security, it is neither expedient nor advisable to circulate any credible evidence which indicates that any of the reported UFO incidents are known by the USAF.

Aside from the obvious air defense aspects of this subject, the Air Force is constantly seeking scientific advances, or their over-all mission, which can be passed on to industry and the management in our own space systems. If UFOs were in fact space ships and/or superior devices possessing the extraordinary capabilities attributed to them, they would, of necessity, be the product of a technology far in advance of that known at the present. It would follow, therefore, that in the Air Force had evidence of the existence of UFOs, it would be most serious to circulate such information among industrial and scientific circles so that our own technology could be advanced.

For your convenience, I am including two copies of the Latest
Aide Memoire, dated 21 July 1960, as the Air Force in Accra.

With specific reference to your inquiry concerning the alleged
UFO which will at Atlanta, Georgia, Inquiry reveals that, on
25 July 1960, at 6:00 p.m., a private from 5th Area "Q" Signal and
landed on the grounds of the Atlanta Federal Prison Farm. To the
parties on damage to property were incurred other than a note which
was 18 inches in diameter. The incident was investigated by
Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel from Fort Mcpherson, Dobbins
and Robins Air Force Bases, Georgia. Fragments of the bomb were
recovered which contained stock numbers and a manufacturer's name
and which were identified as being a portion of an "M-l sporting
charge. The investigation dug 35 feet to the bottom of the hole
and recovered a 5-8" piece of concrete.

Since this incident was reported through explosive evidence
disposal personnel rather than UFO channels, it was never
considered a UFO and no UFO report, as such, was ever rendered.

I hope the foregoing information will be useful. If I may be
of further assistance, please let me know.

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

This is in response to your letter of 29 June 1960 requesting the latest information on unidentified flying objects. Pertinent with information later used in certain experiences, Area the National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

The Air Force position on UFOs remains as stated in Assistant Secretary Quarles' letter to you of 5 May 1955, a copy of which is attached. "There is no substantial evidence to prove that these are space craft from outer space." They may get status a direct physical threat to the security of the country. There are no facts which tend to prove that UFOs are space craft or superior devices under intelligent control being manned by human beings. In the absence of such proof, or cause, or evidence, heretofore, there have been no classified reports which have not been made available to Congress.

[Note: Some words are partially illegible due to image quality, so I've transcribed as accurately as possible]

On July 14 our two planes went on a routine survey mission to the west at what is called Kinney Lake area, near Yreka, California. The location at these coordinates is 41°30'N latitude and 122°30'W longitude in Siskiyou County, California. At approximately 0930 hours, four adults were flying in two planes during the photographic mission. At about 0930 fm (sic) over Kinney Lake area, some straight over Kinney Lake no.2, and numerous until it was over an area like a "lake area". The area was like a lake, and no lake is yet except there was no near or visible to the sound it made... when it neared, the plane kind of "rose up" from the mountains. But there was no sound of impact the last we saw of these object was seen it disappear behind a mountain of trees this area of "minor" trees this trees. We saw the one I continue on down the south of the mountain to the thick grove of trees and on down the hilly toward the Blue Lake, and then for sure it didn't see what it was. One when it was climbing over the lake it was trailing mystery. The major of object was metallic gray, this hiding we saw is to put major sure, none other visible, so could tell, what any bright lights or windows its main size, was perhaps, and with information what a terrible speed.

Text of clipping:
July 21 Kennebunkport, Maine - The editor of the Weekly Star, John M. Cole, after hearing a report that a UFO was hovering over the city, went outdoors with another observer and saw the object, clearly visible in the SE sky at night. The report came from Miss Marjorie Stewart, who had been studying the UFO through binoculars. Cole said, "It is a round object," she said, "and looks like a flying saucer. There is little activity from it. Look me up if you want more information." Cole apparently continued to observe the UFO. He said, "We were able to follow it for perhaps an hour or more."
