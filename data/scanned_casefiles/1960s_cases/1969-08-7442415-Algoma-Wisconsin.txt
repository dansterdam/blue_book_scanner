11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted a bright light west of their boat that would sometimes be obscured by cloud cover. The boat radar lit up then popped out.

COMMENTS: A nearly full moon was at an azimuth of 240° and 5° elevation at the time of the sighting and probably accounts for the visual sightings. There is insufficient data to determine the cause of the radar malfunction. An AF PM 117 was sent to the observer on 23 Aug 60 but has not been returned as of 13 Nov 69.
