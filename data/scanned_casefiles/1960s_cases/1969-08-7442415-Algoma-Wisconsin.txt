2. LOCATION: BAYLOR UNIV. GROUNDS, WACO, TEXAS

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

SUMMARY OF OBSERVATION: Observers sighted a bright light west of their boat that would disappear and reappear. The light was described as being bigger than their boat.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual.

COMMENTS: A nearly full moon was at an altitude of 30Â° and 95 elevation as the time of the sighting, which was visible and probably accounted for the visual sighting. There is insufficient data to conclusively identify the object, but the sighting was probably a natural phenomenon as no evidence of extraterrestrial activity was found. The object was last observed as of 13 Nov 69.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
