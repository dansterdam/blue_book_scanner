27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

I realize the information on attaché form is sparse, but I wrote down all the information I could remember while it was fresh on my mind and mailed same to Wright-Patterson on 22 April, 68. It should be in your office by this time. In addition I made sighting on the night by the 16th, a similar sighting was made on the night of the 17th.

This is also could be in the letter already mailed to you.

Object sighted at 8:20 PM on the night of 4/19. Object "a" appeared to be about 20° above the horizon; 15° about 35° color; was about 25° color.

The night was very clear and all the stars were clearly visible. The midwest identifying star was the Evening Star, which was about 5° SW to the horizon and bright at object.

About 9:00 object "a" began to slowly move toward the horizon, and a swaying or rocking motion (clearing the middle track of object "a" was visible, with the motion of object "a"; was swirling side, with a clear green intermittently. Object "a" was

had begun to glow some new brightly.
Within a few seconds object "c" had

they merged together. Then I noticed that
object "c" had gone below the horizon.
I had a flashlight with me and
decided to see if object "c" would
respond to signals. I flashed the
light toward it several times, this is the
on happening. Object would do the

the lights off this time etc.

The night was partly cloudy, but stars were visible, appearing slightly hazy. About 9:00 P.M. I went outside to watch the skies. Objects in the sky sharply defined in contrast to the hazy other objects. It was swaying slightly, much in the same way as the previous night. Both objects were having different colored lights, viz. bright white, dull green. The light pattern reminded me of spotlights with Christmas trees.

About 9:50 I noticed another object, "C", other same in view slightly to the Northwest of object "B", as it swayed from object "C". I do not know what object "C" means Northwest of object "B". Was thing about this

not move again in the same fairly motion
operating its stopping or halt after some
time before going out of sight behind a
few trees to the Northeast.

Suddenly a few minutes, object is now
about out & did not disappear.

Object is, however, began to disappear. At

I decide to give my flashlight a

night before. Either it returned with

it began to glow much more in

It did not happen.

I stayed outside for about ten minutes to see if it would happen. Then I held the distant feeling as if someone was holding my shoulder. I looked quickly out then were no signs. It does not visibly. My dogs then began barking suddenly and then as if letting up some sort of thing. Then were no one and three. Then the neighbor dogs were barking.

4/1/68. About 6:30 P.M.

We are sitting supper and my three year old daughter began crying and showing at the picture, particularly pointing across the water area. I looked to see what she was pointing out in a sort of completely scared his excitement, on the ground belly and the upper part.

As I watched, before my own eyes, when began to produce more whispers, especially over both knees, shoulders, arms, face and hands. Then this was becoming just and inflamed, beginning to swells. The whispers began to spread over his nerves, body, skin to his feet which began to swell, the same as his face and hands. She was in extreme agony. She almost went into hysterics. I watched her in a cold-wet salts in and then rubbed bathing salts over her much the way I would possibly. She seemed to give her some relief and she slept fitfully most of the night.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON
I regularly watch the skies for unusual phenomena. Objects were much brighter than surrounding skies - were glowing different colored lights.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Two objects moved down below the horizon. The other, larger object just "went out" - did not reappear. See latter. Still another objects moving westward merged with the larger object.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
One object dropped behind a house, one dropped behind a grove of trees.
