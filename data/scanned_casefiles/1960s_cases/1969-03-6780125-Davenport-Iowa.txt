Elmer Man Sees Strange Flying Object--It Stopped His Truck
Elmer Korsgaard, 32, of Elmer, was driving his truck home from work at about 10:15 p.m. Monday, March 3, 1969, when he says he saw a strange flying object near his truck. He said the object was about 75 to 100 feet above the ground and about 75 yards to the side of the truck. Korsgaard said the object was approximately 40 to 60 feet in diameter and was brightly lighted. He said it appeared to be metallic and was moving very slowly from west to east. Korsgaard said that as the object passed over his truck, his engine stalled and he was unable to restart it. He said the object continued on its course and disappeared from sight. When the object was directly overhead, Korsgaard said he could hear a humming sound which he compared to the sound of a high tension line. After the object passed, Korsgaard was able to restart his truck and continue on his way.

Text extracted from the document:

Elmer Man Sees Strange Flying
Object--It Stopped His Truck
(from the Mason Chronicle-
rimes)
Elmer Heinzmann, a 57-year-old Davenport, Iowa man, said he
was driving home from the ALCOA plant about 10:45 p.m. Monday
when he saw a strange object in the sky about 50 feet above the ground. 
He said it was circular in shape, about 30 to 35 feet in diameter, and
had a bright shiny light around the outer edges, like the lens of
car headlights with a bluish-color that was almost blinding to his eyes.
"While I was watching the object approach, it began to slow down
and drop closer to the ground," Heinzmann said. "It then came
to within about six feet of my truck and my motor quit running.
"I watched it for maybe a minute and a half or two minutes as
it hovered just a few feet above the road in front of my truck. Then
it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight instantly."
Heinzmann said he was about two miles west of Walcott, Iowa
when the incident occurred. He estimated the object was about
50 feet above the ground.
"The light from the object was so bright I couldn't make out any
details of the object itself," he said. "I could only see the bright
light. It had no exhaust, no wings, and was completely silent as
it approached and then shot straight up."
Heinzmann said he waited a while after the object disappeared
before trying to restart his truck. It started right up, he said.
"I was really scared at first, but when the thing took off straight
up and disappeared, I was just plain amazed," he said. "I've never
seen anything like it before in my life."
Heinzmann said he was traveling about 55 mph when he first saw
the object. "It was traveling much faster than my truck," he added.
Heinzmann said the object did not come any closer than about 
six feet from his truck. "But that was close enough," he said.
"I can't understand what it was or where it came from. All I know
is that it stopped my truck cold and then shot straight up and was
gone."
Heinzmann said he has no idea what the object was or where it
came from. He said he stopped at a farmhouse near Walcott to
call the Davenport police, but they had no information on similar
reports.
"No one seems to know anything about it," Heinzmann said. "All
I know is that I saw it and it really happened--it was no dream."

What good is this information when it is kept form the public. Security yes, but not from the general public. We need this information to prepare and protect ourselves. At the same time we as citizens can understand and comprehend what we are seeing and experiencing. Do we have to decode the world to protect us from an advanced society. It appears we are living in a controlled environment with very advanced intelligences who have a concept of safety which we cannot comprehend.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 24-30, 1969

The surface map for the period is shown by the dashed lines, and the contours - connected points of equal barometric pressure - are shown by the solid lines. The ridges, or high pressure areas, are shown as elongated ovals, and the troughs, or low pressure areas, are shown as elongated oval-shaped depressions. The numbers show the heights of the constant pressure surfaces in hundreds of feet above sea level.

This weather map is used to analyze the circulation patterns of the atmosphere. The isobars - lines of equal barometric pressure - show the general direction of air flow and wind movement. The positions and movements of high and low pressure systems are important in forecasting future weather conditions. The surface weather data is also recorded on the map, indicating temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and other pertinent information. The weather patterns reflected on these daily maps are used by meteorologists in preparing short-range and long-range weather forecasts.

The vertical section or cross-section through the atmosphere, shown at the bottom of the map, depicts the temperature and moisture conditions. The dashed line indicates the freezing level. The areas of precipitation are indicated by the shaded regions. This information is useful in studying the structure and development of weather systems.

The bottom of the map also includes data on the amount of sunshine, wind speeds, and other meteorological parameters measured at various observation stations across the country.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 31-APR. 6, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the publication called "Daily Weather Maps" which includes the daily weather maps for the 500-millibar chart, air temperature, and lowest temperature forecast/free-air climate. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page, so that a days weather sequence can be readily observed. They are copied from our master collection, which includes the Daily Weather Maps, and distributed as fast as they are available for distribution.

The surface weather maps present, shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degree Celsius. The surface isobars, or lines of equal pressure, are shown in solid lines, with values labeled in millibars. The shading shows the warm and cold-temperature areas, based on the 850-millibar temperatures.

The 500-millibar charts present the contours of the 500-millibar surface at 60-meter intervals. The shaded areas on the 500-millibar charts indicate the areas where the 500-millibar heights are below 5,400 meters, which are usually regions of cloudiness and precipitation.

The height contour values are labeled in meters, and the short lines that intersect the contours indicate the wind direction. The values of the wind speed in knots are given at various points on the 500-millibar charts.

The temperature forecasts for the 24-hour period ending at 0300Z on the date shown are outlined by continuous line. The shaded areas indicate where precipitation is likely.

The price of these maps is $0.30 per page. Order them from: Environmental Data Service, ESSA, C102 - 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80302. Telephone: 303-499-1000, ext. 7210.
