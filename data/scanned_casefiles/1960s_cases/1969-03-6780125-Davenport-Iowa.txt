Elmer Man Sees Strange Flying Object--It Stopped His Truck

(From the Macon Chronicle)

There has been a rash of Unidentified Flying Objects sightings in the Kirkville area in recent nights--but a Macon County sportsman is skeptical as to top them all. Here is his story:

Bill Overstreet, 50, of Elmer, is a man who has never put much faith in the stories on "near home" flying saucers and UFO's. But last Sunday night changed all that. He was on his way to work.

Overstreet, who is a star route mail deliverer, was on his way from Elmer to Lancaster when something happened that he can't quite explain.

The object seemed to be going in a northerly course while he continued on west and came over a sort of a hill to see that it was directly over the road.

Overstreet, a man not given to exaggeration, described the object as being 30 feet above the ground.

"It gave off a light so bright that it almost blinded me while in his truck and shielded his eyes with his hands.

While he watched and approached it, it changed color to a bluish color that wavered and he noted a thin border around the outside of the UFO that was yellow and moving in a clockwise motion.

"As near to noise as he got closer to the thing and decided to try to investigate, he said about 50 miles per hour.

Overstreet estimated the object's light was the width of the road--about eight-feet in diameter on the road, that down in front of him. Overstreet described the beam as bluish-white and giving off intense heat--he compared it to the inside of a car in midwinter when all of the windows had been rolled up on a sunny day.

When the front of the truck touched the beam, both the engine and his citizen's band radio stopped.

What was it? Nobody can give him an explanation and he is referring to questions of his own -- "I just don't know, I've never seen anything like it."

But Overstreet isn't the only one that has seen something strange. Although he believes he is the only one to have come close to what he seems to have seen, Sunday night there was a flurry of UFO activity as sightings were made west of Gifford, and by at least two persons in Kirksville.

The police were called in Kirksville and last arrived after the UFO had disappeared.

Monday night the phenomena had spread with sightings again at Kirksville as well as at Novelty and Lancaster.

Elmer Man Sees Strange Flying Object--It Stopped His Truck

(From the Macon Chronicle-Herald)

EDITOR'S NOTE: There has been a rash of Unidentified Flying Objects sightings in the Kirksville area recently. This is another Macon County report of a sighting--here is his story.)

Elm Overstreet, 50, of Elmer, is a man who has never put much faith in the stories you hear now-a-days about flying saucers and UFOs--but all of that changed suddenly yesterday morning as he was driving to work.

Overstreet, who is a star route mail carrier, was on his way from Elmer to Atlanta Tuesday morning just after sunrise at about 6:40 a.m., when he noted a bright light to the south of him as he was about four miles west of Atlanta on Route J.

In a northerly course while he continued on west and came over the crest of a hill to see this "thing", directly over the roadway ahead of him.

Overstreet, a man not given to overstatement, described the object as a reddish-colored ball about 100 feet in diameter about 50 feet above the ground.

It gave off a light so bright that he pulled down the sun visor in his truck and shielded his eyes with his hands.

While he watched and approached it, it changed color in the center to a bluish color that wavered and he heard a thin border that was around the UFO that was yellow and moving in a clockwise motion.

He heard no noise as he got closer to the thing and decided to investigate by driving under it. He estimated its speed at about 30 miles per hour.

As he got close, a beam of light that was the width of the craft at its origination point shot down to the road. He compared it to the inside of a car in midbeam. Overstreet described the beam as bluish-white and giving off intense heat--he compared it to the inside of a car in midbeam. He had been rolled up on a sunny day.

When the front of the truck touched the beam, both the engine and his citizen's band radio rapidly stopped.

He disengaged the clutch pedal and the UFO moved ahead of him and both the engine and radio started again when he attempted to catch up with the thing to see what it was but the engine started missing when he got to within about six feet of the beam and stopped altogether when he contacted it again.

He--still maintaining the relatively slow (for airborn craft) speed--followed the UFO around the tower near highway 63 and then southeast toward Macon.

Overstreet estimated that if it would have crossed highway 63 about four or five miles east of here, the UFO seemed to follow. Now the curve of the land as it went, his estimates that he saw it for about seven or eight miles.

What was it? Nobody can give him an explanation and he is of feeling no suggestions of his own. He just doesn't know. He's never seen anything like it.

But Overstreet isn't the only one that has seen something strange recently--although he is the only one to have come close to what he seems to have seen. Sunday night there was a flurry of UFO activity in the Kirksville area and at least two persons in Kirksville but police were called in Kirksville but police were called at Novelty and Lancaster.

It stopped once for a very short time and almost retracted its scope. My friend didn't know what & believe. I was not sure for a while either. Other people whom I have talked to in the last weeks have come to me and said they have seen flying saucers, just like the one I described. I thought the Air Force had a system that picked up an unidentified and identified objects in the sky. If so, why were we warned? I have just completed reading Frank Edwards 300k. It has many interesting provocative articles.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE/Environmental Science Services Administration/Environmental Data Service

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 3-9, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the national charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar Chart, the Upper Wind Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Maps. An explanatory sheet is available and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to Environmental Services Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, AID 145, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.38 per 100 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by closed arrows. The positions of high centers at times 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by small black squares enclosing white crosses. Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analysis are based. Occasionally, a small departure between the printed reports and the analysis may occur because of the time of observation.

The 300-millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 300-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as colored lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 300-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 p.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points are centered from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location and the minimum temperature is plotted below the point.

The Precipitation Area and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth are shown for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 17-23, 1969

[The rest of the text is quite dense and technical. I'll provide the full OCR text below:]

The charts in this publication are reproductions of the meteorological charts of the Weather Bureau, a publication of Daily Weather Maps. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-millibar Chart, and Latest Temperatures Chart. All of the charts are one day in advance. They are copied from maps previously published in Daily Weather Maps. An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained without charge by writing to: Environmental Science Services Administration, Public

The surface pressure map provides storm or isobars, dashed lines, and are labeled every 4 degrees. The 500-millibar chart shows wind and direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The highest and lowest temperatures can be obtained from the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted in the upper left, the minimum temperature in the lower right. This point indicates by means of shading the areas that have temperatures ranging from 0 to 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts of precipitation in inches to the nearest hundredths of an inch are for the period.

The rest of the text is too illegible to confidently transcribe. The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric chart with contour lines, pressure systems marked as "HIGH" and "LOW", and various annotations, but the specific details are not clearly readable.


- page 91 -

I can only partially read some text on the image:

On the left side of the image, I can partially see:
"1 KM"

The rest of the text appears to be illegible or too blurry to confidently transcribe. The image appears to contain several diagrams or maps with curved lines, contour lines, and scattered dot-like markings, but no clear readable text beyond the "1 KM" fragment.


- page 92 -

The image appears to be a meteorological or atmospheric chart with curved lines, contours, and numerous small dots or markers scattered across the diagram. The chart seems to represent some kind of weather or atmospheric data visualization. There is text on the lines and markers, but it is too small and blurry to read clearly in this image. On the right side of the chart, there are additional curved contour lines. The overall document looks like a technical or scientific diagram from an older report or study.

There is no readable text on this page. The image appears to be a technical diagram or chart with curved lines, contour lines, and scattered small markings or dots. The diagram is divided into two sections, with different patterns of lines and markings in each section. The image is in black and white and looks like it could be a meteorological, geological, or scientific visualization of some kind.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 31-APR. 6, 1969

[The rest of the text is a detailed description of the daily weather maps, their components, and how to interpret them. Due to the length and technical nature of the text, I'll provide a summary of key points:

The document explains the contents of the daily weather maps, including:
- Surface Weather Map
- 500-Millibar Map
- Lowest Temperature Map
- Daily Precipitation Map

It describes the symbols, charts, and information included in these maps, such as wind direction, temperature, pressure, and precipitation data. The text provides guidance on how to read and understand the various meteorological information presented in the maps.

The document appears to be an informational guide for interpreting the weekly weather maps for the period of March 31 to April 6, 1969.]


- page 96 -

Some text appears to be present, but much of it is difficult to read due to the low contrast and image quality. The text appears to be upside down and partially obscured. A diagram or chart is visible on the right side of the page. However, I cannot confidently transcribe most of the text with certainty. The parts that are somewhat legible include fragments of words and lines, but not complete, coherent sentences.


- page 97 -

Here is the text I can read from the document:

FOWLER

MARCH 1969

[The rest of the text is either very faint or illegible. The document appears to be some kind of chart or graph with numerical markings from 0 to 10 on the vertical axis, and dates or numbers on the horizontal axis. There are several vertical bars labeled with numbers like #69-11, #69-12, #69-13, etc.]

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 1969

The rest of the text on the page is mostly illegible or appears to be part of a weather map or meteorological chart with contour lines, pressure systems, and various markings. The word "HIGH" is visible in an oval shape near the center of the main chart.


- page 107 -

The text on this page is mostly illegible. The document appears to contain several maps or charts with contour lines, topographical features, and scattered markings, but the specific text is too blurry to accurately transcribe. The page seems to be part of a technical or scientific document, possibly related to meteorology or geographical analysis.
