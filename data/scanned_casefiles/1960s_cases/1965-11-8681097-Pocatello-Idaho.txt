To whom it may Concern-
I much feel some one wants a new story right. So here a few lines.

I'll possible relate a early Sunday have been visiting at 12:28
A.M. Sunday, my wife and I had been expecting some friends. The
weather was 12-30Â° cold and it came up
the outside stairs facing the
east. When they were coming up
the stairs I saw what seemed to
be 2 red lights right 77 a plane in
the sky, only 2 didn't look like a plane on
it. as usual, I'm a woman of
the 40's my husband will
tell you are more details and
I'll accordingly relate it as I saw
it tell!

Place where I saw, object coming over the horizon, becoming larger as it swiftly became greater with wind it was so I could see. It was going with the wind, leaving the watch in very much as it was.

Here is the text I can discern from the document:

[The text is handwritten and somewhat difficult to read in parts, but I'll transcribe what I can make out:]

There is also a hand-drawn circular diagram with radiating lines on the page.

Some words are illegible or partially obscured, so I've used ellipses (...) to indicate those areas.
