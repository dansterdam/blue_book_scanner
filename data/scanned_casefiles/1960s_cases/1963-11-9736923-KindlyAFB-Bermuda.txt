Dear Mr. Harvey:

This is in reply to your letter dated 9 Nov 63 requesting information concerning an UFO sighted near Port Haven Tinsdale on 7 Sep 63. According to an unusual aerial sighting by the Deputy Sheriffs in Port Haven.

Thank you for reporting this incident to this Air Force. It is the policy since Deputy Sheriff's Walter Haines and Frank Clark apparently did not at the moment to the Air Force authorities, and we have no record of this particular unidentified flying object. Because we are interested in the report, we are sending these copies of Form 164 which is an official questionnaire in which they can detail information with respect to this sighting. In order to make an evaluation, it is necessary that we ascertain certain details such as the shape or direction of the object, the total duration of the sighting, and whatever.

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI-PD
WASH 25 D C

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Congressman Harvey regarding a UFO sighting in Saint Clair County, Michigan, on 12 Nov 63.

2. It is believed that the object sighted by Deputy Baker was a helicopter. However, efforts to identify a specific vehicle have proved negative. Reasons for belief that the object was a helicopter are as follows:

a. During telephone conversation between Doctor J Allen Hynek and Deputy Baker information received indicated that this was the most probable cause.

b. A helicopter was observed during the day light hours on subsequent days by other persons in the area and their stories of the observations were carried in local newspapers.

c. Efforts to identify these subsequent observations with a particular helicopter proved negative.

3. Should Congressman Harvey desire further investigative efforts to identify known helicopter activity in the area, officials from Selfridge AFB may be directed to conduct this investigation. However, we feel that additional expenditure of funds and manpower is not warranted in view of the long delay in time since the initial report. Also, we feel there is sufficient evidence to justify an evaluation of this sighting as a helicopter observation.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Dear Mr. Harvey:

The Air Force has completed an investigation made at your request, of an unusual aerial phenomena reported in the Fort Chimo-Knob of November 12, 1963.

United States Air Force Technical Information forms were forwarded to Deputy District of Newfoundland in order that they could provide as detailed an account as possible of the sighting. The forms, which include a statement by A. Blain, Mgr., Director, Earban Observatory, Northwestern University, and William Loganoski, scientific consultant to the Air Force with Deputy District of Newfoundland, concerning the aerial phenomena, talked by telephone with Deputy Chief, Air Force Intelligence, and a summary made. Based on this report, it is believed that the object sighted was a helicopter. While a review to identify a specific helicopter proved negative, the fact that a Canadian Army helicopter was midway by other persons in the area, and their stories of the occurrence, are pertinent.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated. It is hoped that this information will be helpful.

Request for Information on UFO Sighting

Commander
Selfridge AFB, Michigan

1. We have received a report of a UFO sighting, by Deputy Sheriff Robert Baker of Saint Clair County, Michigan, which took place on the night of 12 Nov 63 in Port Huron, Michigan. This sighting was not reported to USAF for investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2. However, various articles in the local newspapers contained an evaluation of this sighting. FTD Form 164 was sent to the principal witness for compilation and the form was returned to FTD on 13 Dec 63.

2. On 19 Dec 63 Doctor J Allan Hynek, from Northwestern University and consultant to the Air Force's project on UFO's, contacted Deputy Baker by telephone. During this conversation it was determined that the most probable cause for the sighting was a helicopter. Mr Baker also indicated that the object was sighted near the area and their observations were carried in the local newspapers. Deputy Baker indicated, as of this date, however, that they have not been received by this office.

3. We are anxious to complete our evaluation of this case and report our findings to Commanding General USAF (SAFOI-PS). Although there has been a delay of more than two months we request that an effort be made to identify a specific or any possible helicopter activity in this area during the reported period of the sighting.

4. We are attaching copies of pertinent correspondence.

'STRANGE 'LIGHT' OBSERVED

Deputies See Object In Sky
By JOHN F. BROWN

"People will say we are crazy," Deputy Sheriffs Robert Baker and Merle Clark said today. They were asked to describe what they saw last night.

THEY DIDN'T say they saw flying saucers or little green men, but they did say something very strange happened when they were out on routine patrol.

The officers were very specific in their story, and for their experience, for today a peculiar story has a place in the blare of something not of the ordinary... especially from a "pat" by his fellow man.

But remember when they thought the World was flat... Even this Times Herald rep. to his companion, "There is something odd."

The officers pulled over to the Continued on Page 11, Col. 3

3 Others Also See 'Object'
Three other persons have collaborated the story of a "strange light" observed in the sky early today.

Robert J. Kemp, 3063 Sylvan Drive, Lakeport, who was in the way way work at St. Charles Community Hospital, said that when he came out of his house between 5:15 and 5:20 a.m. there was a main sound that drew his attention skyward. He said there was a light that moved in the direction of Lake Huron.

"I thought it was very strange for the sound was very peculiar and the light was never heard before," Mr. Kemp said.

Ralph E. Jordan, 15, of 4537 Keewahdin Road who was walking with his father after feeding some steers about 5:20 a.m., and his father also saw the strange light.

"We didn't hear anything, but the light was flashing, and it was big in the sky—and it sure was a very strange feeling about you," young Ralph said.

shoulder of the road and stared at what they said was "a flicker" high in the sky."

They said it seemed to be hovering over the apple orchard near Kewaunee.

Deputy Baker, an officer with 14-years of service behind him, said they could make out no fire, or shape to the object other than it was a flashing light that could move in an direction.

"It seemed at times that three was a big divided window in there," Baker said. "But I couldn't be sure."

Deputy Baker and the object came low, about the height of a City block.

"Then, as it came, the object seemed to move out toward the north east and we attempted to follow it," Baker said.

THE OFFICER said they reached speed up to 15 miles an hour trying to track away from us.

This time, the officers turned out the car lights and shined toward the object.

The patrol car was now toward the object. They seemed much closer to the object.

The officers then turned their flashing light on top of the patrol car and in a few moments they said the object seemed only had a flashing white light, but it seemed the object was flashing a red light back.

Deputy Baker said the object was still in the sky and he could hear the sound of motors.

The patrol car was stopped, and the ignition off when they all heard the sound of motors.

Then, fading in noise, all of a sudden the noise be came louder and more powerful and began to move off into the north west section of the sky, he said.

THE OFFICERS were not sure themselves what they saw and heard what they did. At first they were not going to say anything about what happened, but they decided it would be best to let someone know.
