10. CONCLUSION
Sighting: Probable AIRCRAFT
(INSUFFICIENT CLARITY)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted a white object that looked like a cigar with a dome toward the front. The object passed in front of and behind clouds and made no noise.

Comments: The local investigating officer felt that there was a question to the reliability of the witness. A dome on a cylindrical body, as reported by the observer could not be seen on the photograph. Three aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting. In particular a Cessna 141 was obscending from 3000 to 2100 ft arriving at Omaha at 0340Z. This would place the aircraft below the 4000'ft broken overcast condition that existed in the area.

SUBJECT:    UFO REPORT - No. 76, Cambridge, Mass. - 8:40 PM EST - 10/3/67

DATE:       13 October 1967

FROM:       NICAP MASS DIRECTOR

TO:         NICAP, Washington, D.C.                 Ref: CO UFO PROJECT
                                                    (20 PAGES)

The attached report of a UFO sighting near Fresh Pond, Cambridge
is sent to you for your files. On 10/3/67 at place of occurrence.

The Waltops Island, Virginia Martin Cloud astronomers is not
responsible for this incident although this witness received many
calls on that incident with was over by 9 PM on 10/4/67 - which at
approximately 7:15 PM EST. I saw the 10/4/67 experiment myself.
The witness had also seen this experiment on 10/3/67 earlier in
the evening at 7:15 PM. The main clouds was dispersed by
the time of this sighting. Size, direction and elevation are
not compatible. The description of the UFO is strikingly familiar
with the 10/4/67 sighting at Waltops, Massachusetts between 6:30-
7:15 PM EST. This report has also been forwarded.

I spoke with the "Sky-site" advertising place company's manager
revealed that his interest was not otherwise. There is no astronomical
phenomena which would account for what the witnesses described.
Will be seen when reading this report, a check was made by NICAP MASS
NICAP Investigator Nathan Gold to see if any ships or other things
in the area would have given the appearance of the UFO described -
the results were negative. Although conventional aircraft are a
acute possibility, the object described did not appear to be such.
This was seen somewhat similar to the somewhere UFO photographed
over Trinidad Island on January 15, 1958. Its lights were all red.

The witnesses are well-known by Mr. Gold. Mrs. June Remain is his
mother-in-law.

Respectfully submitted,

We were driving along Rt. 16 at South Bend in Camberly, when we saw something in the sky which caught our attention. I wanted to move my speed to get a better and longer view of this object. It appeared to the standing still we watched as we drove out of sight of it.

To me it looked like the planet Saturn through a telescope. The center was shifted in a foggy amber glow. Around it was a circle of lights. When we first saw it, we saw a center glow with a circle completely around it. As we drove on we got a different angle, one from a side view. The top of the center was luminous and the outer rim now looked like a staggered line of lights.

Here is the text I can read from the document:

ARROWS SHOW DIRECTIONS IN
SIGHTINGS

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram with several lines and nodes, with some faint text annotations near the lines and nodes, though some of those annotations are difficult to read clearly.

Mrs. Ananian also saw the Wallops Island rocket display and said this didn't look anything like that. The time is pretty accurate as she was hurrying to get to Sommerville before nine P.M.

After she described the object I showed her pictures of the Trinidad Island UFO. She immediately identified it as the same thing she saw.

I checked the area during the daytime to see if there were any signs on high poles or other things that may have given the appearance described when illuminated at night. There was nothing that even remotely fitted the description of the object seen.

I have known Mrs. Ananian for almost three years (she's my mother in law). She is not an excitable person, and I can vouch for her reliability in general.

Miss [redacted]
[redacted], N.J. 07208

October 3, 1967

Dear Miss Bevilacqua:

Brought to my attention the other day was a lengthy speculation in the sky, some kind of imaging, I am quite concerned. I have studied some of the material in the subject of UFO's and I am trying to my satisfaction to myself to understand the situation. I am positive that I do not believe in little green men with ray guns from Mars. I do believe there are flying objects throughout the universe having qualities which I'll prove, possibly in the future, as the conditions are relative.

WORLD REPORT
On the Sonic Boom
Merry-Go-Round
By United Press International

Theodore O. Elsner of Addison said today he got on a "merry-go-round" last July when a sonic boom created by a jet plane broke his mother's vase.

After learning from newspaper stories that all claims from sonic boom damage in Illinois must be sent to Chanute Air Force Base at Rantoul, Elsner notified the Air Force.

Officials at Chanute simply sent Elsner routine forms to fill out, "requiring by regulation," according to Col. John W. Miller of the Office of Information at the base.

Elsner said he received 18 pages of government forms. Miller said the Air Force sent only 5 forms, each of which had one, two or three copies, along with a letter of instructions on how to fill out the forms.

IN THE official letter, the Air Force said it would reimburse Elsner for the vase - $595 -- if it found a sonic boom caused the damage.

Elsner refused to fill out the forms. "He thought it was ridiculous to fill out 18 forms," his mother said. "And he was so busy."

Sees UFO... With Propeller!

The sighting of an unidentified flying object has been reported in Mount Prospect by a Rolling Meadows youth.

Fred Thoma, 19, of 2313 Eastman in Rolling Meadows, told police officer William Curtis that he saw a strange craft hovering over a field late Saturday night.

Thoma said he first noticed it as he was driving west with his girlfriend on Central Rd. near Busse Rd.

Thoma described the object as having a saucer shaped body topped by a spinning propeller. He said that there was a white light between the propeller and the craft's body.

THOMA SAID he took his girl home, returned to the field in time to see the craft. "As big as a one-car garage," slowly descending.

Thoma left the scene and hailed Curtis, who was cruising nearby in a squad car.

When Curtis arrived at the field he found no trace of the mysterious object.

To Whom it May Concern,

On the advice of an educated gentleman from Philadelphia I am sending a copy of a U.F.O. report to your organization. Also enclosed is a topographical map of the area.

Please be advised that the length of time that the object was in sight is estimated only. The report states approximately 60 seconds but it could have been only 30 seconds.

The weather was clear and the stars were out.

U. F. O. Sighting

Date: October 7, 1967
Time: 7:30 P. M.
Location: Inlet Creek (White Swan Lake area, East of Canal Flats, B.C.)
Description: Disc shape with dome. Lower section glowed firey red similiar to a star. Dome pulsated with a bright blue light.
Path of Flight: West to East on direct course.
Altitude: Impossible to estimate except high above mountains.
Speed: From skyline to skyline in approximately 1 minute.
Flight Description: U. F. O. appeared on the skyline above the mountains on the West moving rapidly East on a straight line across the valley. About 10 seconds after sighting, the object expelled a fire ball which appeared to be the same size as the object. The fire ball hovered in mid air and two separate small particles were seen to blow and then burn out. Directly over the centre of the valley, the blue pulsating dome became visible and remained so until the object disappeared on the skyline to the East. The above information and sketch is accurate and correct to the best of our ability.

Miss Turnure/SAF-OIC/76525/Oct 13, 1967

Dear [redacted]:

This will reply to your letter of October 8, regarding your two sightings of UFOs.

The first happened so long ago, and so many details necessary to positive identification of a sighting are missing, that identification would be virtually impossible at this point in time. Perhaps the enclosed Project Blue Book report will help you to identify it.

The second sighting was more recent; however, necessary details are omitted. Therefore, if you would care to complete the attached questionnaire, and forward it in the postage-free envelope we are enclosing, to the address given on the envelope, we shall try to determine what you actually observed.

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please contact the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately. By so doing, you will have a much greater chance of having your sighting identified.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch

Oct. 8, 1967

To whom it may concern:

I would like to report two sightings
of U.F.O.'s that I and a member of friends
have seen.

The first one, soon they say occurs,
and I, happened about a year ago in
October. I don't remember the date but
the time was around 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM. It
was on the Millersburg in Pennsylvania
with where I live - my cousin and I were
cleaning racks of the ice that little birds
in all thrown on. The ice was then, about
two inches, so we crawled on our
stomach. I heard as strange sound, I shined
my flashlight across the ice and saw a
light looked like two reflectors over each
other. I called my cousin attention to it.
We put our lights out, but the thing was
still there. I heard the noise again. It was
very and distant. It was a thumping sound.
The object began to move closer. When we
just saw it, as it was about 400 yd away,
then it began missing the lights changed
position and was now side by side. Its
status means toward was very fast. We
got off the ice and started to get, trying
to get our answer, but no answer was had.
We were getting faster the faster the object
moved. We ran for the car. When we started
to go across a bridge, where that cross the lake,


- page 86 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

The object was in an dim light from a near pt. It appeared to be flat, oval, and a dome like centers, that were the lights were, one the come. We then took off in the cars that was the last we saw of it.

The second sighting happened only a few days ago, on October 13. At friend named will, and I were sitting about 7:30 p.m. at was dark. She heard a fisherman yell from across the stream he see saw something in the sky and we ran out to see a white mass materializing in the sky. It was bright, slightly oval, and about 10 feet in diameter. It appeared about as big as a weather balloon. It was evolving, like on its vertical axis materialized over it. Then the second one disappeared and the first one that was small objects in the direction where the second one was. There was a cloud formation nearly to the objects left. There was one long cloud in vertical position. I began to sight light shot out of the cloud toward the object and remained in sight for min. We watched as a jet moved in very fast and slowed to circle around the object how the object became very bright. The jet was sent at us, that might, but they were in the south. The object were in the east. The white should have changed its color to a blue or orange. Two friends saw the rocket come.

Here is the text from the document:

...said it had changed colors. About ten people fishermen witnessed the object including Bill and me.

I am a strong believer in flying saucers. I have read many books. If there is more change would you please send me information on the "Incident at Easter" and, or information on other sightings.

Thank you for reading letter. Letter could you please answer this letter. tell me what the charge would be, if any, for a copy of "Project Blue Book" I have read people have received copies.

Thanks you,

I mentioned it since it would be possible for the T-29 to have been near the area if he had been flying approaches prior to the landing. The active runway was 30 and an instrument missed approach would place the aircraft near the location of the sighting. I have no details on the flight of the T-29 as yet since it was not an OFCUT aircraft. The aircraft was from the A900 ABM, Kirkland AFB and was piloted by Captain Dale N. Amend, FR54029 and the copilot was Captain James A. Malek, FV300637. I have sent a letter to Captain Amend to inquire about his flight in order to determine if he could have been in the area. I will forward the information concerning the T-29 when I receive it.

3. Mr. Griffin of the FAA reports that only three aircraft flew near this area at any time close to the time of the sighting. A Cessna 411 flew from Grand Island to Omaha descending from 6,000 feet to 2,100 feet arriving at Omaha at 03402. This would place the aircraft below the 1,000 ft broken to overcast condition that existed in the area of the sighting time also.

4. There were two other flights near that area. A DC-6 passed over Omaha at 08/0319Z at 12,000 feet descending to 6,000 feet going to Lincoln on a flight path approximately 3 miles north of the area. A United Airlines Boeing 727 flying from Denver, Colorado at Fl 210 passed over Omaha at 08/0327 on a path approximately 10 miles north.

5. The DC-6 and the Boeing 727 appear to both have passed the area too early and at too high an altitude to be a factor, but I mention them in case this is of any importance to you. I have enclosed a map showing the flight paths.

6. If I can be of any other assistance please let me know.

Three 2½ inch by 3½ inch Polaroid Black and White Prints

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order 68-4 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, requesting that photo analysis be accomplished on three Polaroid prints to determine the nature of the image appearing on these prints.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the prints produced the following results: An image is present on each of the photographs. The images appear as a white streak or a black background. The lack of definitive visual precise details to image identification, as to image location on a cylindrical body, as reported by the observers could not be seen on the photograph.

SUBJECT:    UFO Sighting - Ipswich, Mass. - 10/02/57 - 8:30-9:15 PM EDT

DATE:       10 October 1967

FROM:       Raymond E. Fowler

SIGHTING BACKGROUND:

On the evening of 2 October 1957 I returned home from lecturing on UFOs at 11:15 PM to find that a Mr. William Castle of the Ipswich Chronicle and NICAP MASS SUBCOM Investigator Robert Jackson had left telephone messages regarding a UFO sighting which had taken place in Ipswich earlier. I phoned both parties and learned that Bob Jackson had been informed about the sighting and that both he and Ipswich Chronicle reporter had interviewed the witnesses. Later, Investigator Jackson personally interviewed with additional data on the sighting. It was decided that the sighting was significant and further investigation was undertaken. The following summary with detailed attachments contain the NICAP MASS SUBCOM report on the sighting.

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS: (Typed from Investigator Jackson's Report)

GROUP #1     Mr. and Mrs. Frank Dineen         Mrs. Thomas Quintilliani
             Leslie Road,                       Leslie Road,
             Ipswich, Mass. 356-4914            Ipswich, Mass. 356-3188

             Miss Marion Norcross               Mr. Kenneth Robinson
             Leslie Road,                       Leslie Road,
             Ipswich, Mass. 857-2805            Ipswich, Mass. 356-2024

At 8:30 PM, Mr. Frank Dineen left his house to go to his car at the rear of the house. Upon leaving the door he noticed a stationary object high in the sky, apparently in line with a very bright white source which seemed to change position from one end of the object to the other side. He watched it for a moment and then called to Mrs. Dineen and Mrs. Norcross who were in the house. They both came outside and stood with Mr. Dineen and watched for approximately 5 minutes.

At this point it was at a 60° elevation and its position was 315° NW to the observer. Mr. Dineen had to get a bank to observe the object's position. At this point the object began to display a slight up-and-down motion and then began very slowly moving to the west, circling along in back of some trees and stopping at a position of 270° W. At this point Mrs. Dineen observed a somewhat hazy shape. Mrs. Dineen went into the house and made a quick phone call to her neighbor, Mrs. Thomas Quintilliani, who arrived a few moments later. The three women and a man named Kenneth Robinson went outside. At the side of the house (50 feet right and north of their first position), and observed the object between two trees at

UFO RPT - Ipswich, Mass. - 10/02/67                                                Sheet Two

Approximately 45° elevation and a position of 320° NW. The object tilted erratically seemed to receive its color changing for one light changed position at a new interval. The object was in a space of 4°. At this time it appeared to approach and back off slowly.

The object appeared to most of the observers as being "oval-shaped" giving off a glow (yellow) which seemed to be most intense around the parallel circumference which illuminated the object and the sky in the area. After watching the object for approximately 10 minutes at this second position, Mr. Damon decided to report to the Ipswich police and telephoned them about 8:50 PM. They gave her Bob Jackson's number. In the meantime, Miss Morcross had left around 8:40 to alert her father Arthur Morcross. Patrolman Fred Layland of the Ipswich police arrived about 9:00 PM and watched it moving away in the distance. By the time he arrived it was just a light source moving and changing colors as previously described.

GROUP # 2     Mr. Hiram Morcross
             Leslie Road
             Rowley, Mass. 837-2805

On October 3rd I interviewed Mr. Hiram Morcross at his home in Rowley. The Rowley-Ipswich town line runs between the Dinseen and Morcross residences. The distance between the two homes is approximately 200 feet. Miss Morcross drove back to alert her father about 8:40 PM. He was welding in his mill at the rear of his house. She called to him and he came outside, looked up and saw a "perfectly circular" bright red disc moving "very slowly" across his line-of-sight at a position of 210° in the SSE. From 210° he saw an elevation of 65°. He watched the object at this position for about 30 seconds and then got into the car with his daughter (Miss Morcross and drove the short distance to the Dinseen residence). From there, when he arrived the object was moving away to the NW and diminishing in size. He told me he left because "there was not much to see at that distance" and he wanted to get back to his mill and finish his welding job. Mr. Morcross told me that the object, even from Dinseen's house, still appeared to be circular and that he could not detect any color change from the red. He left for the mill about 8:50 PM. During my interview, he added that when the apparent size of the object was and he pointed to a pebly on a wire of comparable apparent size with subtended about 2°.

GROUP # 3     Patrolman Brian Lombard
              8 Capervley Road
              Ipswich, Mass. 356-3328

By the time Lombard arrived all that could be seen was a light source changing colors moving away in the distance. He said that it could have been anything and that one could not tell whether it were an aircraft or not. He did note that it was changing from red to white and back to red.

UFO RPT - Ipswich, Mass. - 20/02/67                                   Sheet Three

INVESTIGATING COMMENTS:

Mrs. Dineen's sketch illustrating a "domed" object is probably partly imaginative and based upon an object that she and her husband had seen on Rt. #183 in Haverys in the Fall of 1965 which resembled "two pie plates stuck together". She mentioned she pulled off Rt. #123 to watch this object.

However, from the other observer's accounts, the characteristics most emphasized was the: 1) oval shape 2) illuminating glow about the object in sky 3) lights position changing and revolving 4) side-to-side motion 5) no sound 6) DAS landing (See enclosed sketch).

All witnesses involved are of average intelligence. Most were unable to express themselves at any length in their narratives. Mrs. Dineen seemed to be best able to express herself. I re-contacted Mrs. Dineen concerning the question of distance. She confirmed, as she did with the other verbally on the date, that the object, she would have to approximately 500 feet in the direction of the object. However, I took compass readings at both positions of the observers which were approximately 50 feet apart (Group # 1) in parallel with the object's path from first position. When the observers were at the left side of the house (see sketch), the object was at a NW position and then it moved to the right for 45° into the object. Then the observers traversed the 50 feet parallel with the object's path to their second position on the right hand side of the house. It again regained a NW position. In other words, the observer noted that the object OVERCOK the 45° distance that the object travelled from its first NW position. Therefore, the object very likely was closer than 500 feet. Mrs. Dineen could not have understood the question concerning the distance of the object when she first had answered the question on the form.

On October 4th I returned to the Dineen's home to obtain Frank Dineen's filled-in UFO report form. I again questioned Mr. and Mrs. Dineen as to the actual shape of the red, green and white lights. They stated that they could not actually discern apparent lights on the object, but that the object itself seemed to be changing colors. The center white light may have had a roundish shape and been attached to the object, but they were not sure. I asked Mr. Dineen, the closest observer of the object and lights indicates that the object itself was changing color. It is strange that Mr. Morrow saw only one color red. The town of Haverhill site was 10°. Approximately 2°. He felt he was much closer at his mill and wished he had stayed instead of joining the others.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS AND EVALUATION:

ANIMAL REACTION:

Everyone remembered distinctly that they heard dogs barking throughout the area during the sighting. No one remembered hearing when before the sighting or during the sighting any dogs barking. None of the witnesses ever bothered to check and see whose dog(s) were barking.

I had Investigator Jackson do some checking on this aspect of the

UFO RPT - Ipswich, Mass. - 10/02/57                                   Sheet Four

Sighting. Key findings are summarized below:

1) A family named Fowler (no relation to me) on Leslie Road and both of their dogs shot on 10/7/57 because they were attacking each other. A German shepherd, badly mauled the other dog, a Collie, and both were done away with.

2) Mrs. Quintilliani thought her dog may have caused the others to fight as her female dog was "in heat" so she had her dog shot.

3) A Mrs. Clark Budd of Leslie road who owns a Milk Farm stated that both of her dogs were barking on the night of the sighting and she remembers that one kept on barking up on a nearby hill and would not come home when called for a half-hour.

To attribute the temperament of the dogs and the resultant extermination of the dogs to some effect caused by the UFO is pure conjecture. It is more interesting than many dogs were heard barking during the night. This and other aspects of the sighting bear resemblance to other UFO sightings.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
The trees which the UFO moved behind were about 150 feet from the witnesses (Group #1) and about 50 feet high.

ADVERTISING PLANS: Not airborne on this date

WEATHER: (U.S. Weather, Logan Airport, Boston, Mass.)
TIME: 8:30 PM    TEMP: 55°    VISIBILITY: Clear    CEILING: Unlimited
WIND DIRECTION: South    WIND SPEED: 9 mph

ASTRONOMICAL: Nothing in directions noticed that would give observers an impression of a large oval object. Movements, size, etc. rule out astronomical phenomena.

SATELLITE DATA: Not Applicable

CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT:
Confirmation and noiseless factors seem to rule out aircraft unless all observers were greatly exaggerating. Color of lights was conventional but not descriptive.

EVALUATION:
As one studies the complete report, it is apparent that many UFO characteristics were observed. In this case there were no signs of an Unidentified Flying Object.

NOTE: I phoned several police stations along the project the object was not with negative results. (on 10/2/67 late PM)

Dear

It was most gratifying to get your letter yesterday, and to know that you had found out what you had really seen.

No, now that you have identified your UFO, we will not need to send the questionnaire to Wright-Patterson AFB; we will let then know you are not going to send it.

And incidentally, we do not think you are a great big idiot; just remember that the only people who do not make mistakes are those who lack intelligence and the ability to observe the world around them. It takes a really big person to admit that he has made a mistake.

Thank you for letting us know what you saw.

Dear [redacted],

I fell like a dummy after writing to you saying that I saw three U.F.O.'s in the sky on October 3, but usually when I write a letter or something to be mailed it has the tendency to hang around my desk for about 12 years(I'm 17).Well with your letter I mailed it that night. I went to bed that night at about 11:30, and while listening to the radio, its a portable and under my pillow, I heard that N.A.S.A. was making the sky turn weird color's. What was happening was that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the atmosphere.(If you remember, you probably dont, I said I saw the same things about two years before). The next day guess what was on the front page of the two most popular newspapers. "SPACESHIPS LAND AND RED AND GREEN STRIPED CREATURE'S APPEAR". No it didnt say that, but it did say, and explain,


- page 166 -

that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the atmosphere and that at the same time the following night the same thing would happen. Sure enough it did and I felt like an idiot,and a big one at that(I'm 6 foot 3 inches).

Well now that you have read the introduction to my question here it is: Should I fill out the questionnaire on the you-of-owns (U.F.O.'s) because I now know what I saw and certainly you know what it was.My address is on the bottom,and thanks again for listening to my complaints.

Reference your letter of October 3 regarding your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO), it is impossible to tell precisely what you saw unless we have more information.

If you will complete the attached questionnaire and send it in the postage free envelope we are providing to the address given on the envelope, it is quite possible that you will find out what you observed.

Dear Sirs,

I've read your March 1967 edition about U.F.O's and found it very interesting. All though I may not be a brain or some intellectual genius, I'm no dummy.

If the letter is still in your hands, and not in the wastepaper basket, I'll tell you the reason why I wrote to you. Tonight, at about 7:25, I went to look out of my window and saw three white objects that were about on the same horizon of the north star. They were drawn to my attention by one of my brothers and my mother. ( I just reread what I wrote and I want to clearify something. "the objects" were like masses and they were not moving, but eventually they did disappear, as I will explain later. "the same horizon as the north star", I determined this because in the 12 grade, I'm in 12 now, I used an astrolabe to show the earth rotated.)

These masses that I mentioned were about 3 to 4 inches, from where I was, in diameter; and as they faded away they just got larger and larger. They grew to about 5 or 6 inches wide.

While I was observing this phenomena I was missing another phenomena ( I Dream of Gennie). The first mass to go was the smallest and the brightest of the three. That left at about 7:40. The two others, within the period of twenty minutes af-

until about 7:50 and then it started to blend in with the

Well if you have got this far and you are not asleep
yet or have gone cross-eyed with my typing ,I would like to
thank you for your time and patience in reading this letter
and trying to cope with my (AHEM ! ) jokes.You are probably
