The text in the document is as follows:

"SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, DATE: 8 OCTOBER 1965

The aircraft was holding in the K. I. Sawyer range south, holding westbound. The light was flashing, was clear of clouds at the altitude of 30,000 feet.

The light was first sighted at approximately 2145 hours local time. Assuming the light to be a star, the crew paid little attention to it. At 2200 hours, the light was observed to be about 5 miles south of the aircraft and was accelerating. At 2208 hours, the light had reached a speed estimated at 2,000 miles per hour and was climbing vertically at a very high rate of climb. The light was observed to have caused an investigation to be conducted by radar. The investigation was discontinued at 15,000 feet.

They stated the performance was had experience refusing F-86 and F-106 aircraft in the area. The object was not visible to ground radar or the reporting aircraft.

Use of AF Form 112 and 113 as per AFR 200-2 not possible. No further investigation.

ROBERT H. DICKSON, Major, USAF
