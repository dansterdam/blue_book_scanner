2. LOCATION: Ever K I Sawyer AFB, Michigan

3. SOURCE: Military

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 minutes

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Air-Visual

7. COURSE: 250 deg

8. PHOTOS: ☐ Yes ☒ No

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: ☐ Yes ☒ No

10. CONCLUSION: Astro (VENUS) Venus on horizon at 230 deg. (16.14h) mag -3.9 in process of setting. Motion attributed to refraction of setting planet.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Object was sharply outlined, solid colored light. When first spotted was white, then turned to red and brilliant red when it accelerated. Faded as it pulled away in the distance. Had the ability to accelerate rapidly but at first appeared stationary. Co-pilot saw a light believed to be a lost Cessna 172. Light appeared stationary then accelerated straight ahead. Climbed rapidly. The light was first spotted on top of an overcast, it climbed between us and a distant cloud bank, no stars were noticed until the light climbed above the cloud into the clear air.

POSSIBLE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING

The aircraft was holding in the K I Sawyer Tacum south holding pattern. Clouds were an undercast, tops at 9,000 feet. High clouds up to 35,000 feet surrounding the area. Area of sighting was clear of clouds at the altitude of sighting.

The light was first sighted at the oneclock low position as aircraft started on outbound leg. Assuming the light to be a Cessna 172 reported lost in the area, the pilot requested and received permission to descend to 15,000 feet and investigate. Descend was started at 45 nautical miles from Sawyer Tacum on a 170-300 foot heading. At this time, closure was seemingly affected with aircraft was a closure appeared to have ceased and it was noted that the light was accelerating. Aircraft speed was increased to 240 knots to identify was discontinued at 15,000 feet.

The crew of the aircraft has had experience refueling B-52 and fighter aircraft. They stated the performance of the sighted object far superseded that of any aircraft known to the crew.

No outline of the object was possible in the darkness. Only a well defined light that changed from white to various shades of red, and was last observed climbing on a southwesterly course.

Other air bases, weather stations and FAA facilities in the area have been contacted and report they had no activity in the area at the time.

Object was not visible on ground radar or the reporting aircraft radar.

Use of AF Form 112 and 112A as per AFR 200-2 not possible. No forms available at this installation.

WITH PEOPLE CONCERNED IN SIGHTING CALLING MSF PETER NO TIME UP TO THE LIGHT WAS AWAY FROM THE AIRCRAFT. MSF STATED THEY HAD NO KNOWN TRAFFIC. THERE WAS NO AIRCRAFT FLYING IN THE AREA. MSF CENTER CLEARED US TO 15,000 FEET TO CHECK IN THAT LIGHT. WE CLIMBED TO 15,000 FEET AND LOOKED AROUND. TACTICAL AIR LIFT WITH THE JOINT AIRBORNE CONTROL CENTER AT 15,000 FT. WE THEN DESCENDED TO 10,000 FT. LIGHT WAS REPORTED AND THOUGHT NOTHING ADVANCED - THE LIGHT ACCELERATED AND CLIMBED OUT OF SIGHT. WE WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE LIGHT WAS.
