Altitude estimated at 3 miles. Tear drop shape, no wings, protrusions, exhaust or trail. Speed estimated at 2,000 mph. Object believed to be 5 miles distant. Straight flight from 15 deg elevation in SW to crossing zenith to 15 deg elevation in NE where object broke up. Observation similar to meteor observed in 1939."

Object descriptive of meteor. Speed consistent with meteor observation. However, some inconsistency in estimation of duration. Probable error in estimating time. Since obj compared to a previous meteor observed, this case is evaluated as a meteor.
