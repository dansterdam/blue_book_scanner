My Dad, an aeronautical engineer, , an engineering student going to Cornell University, and myself were having a family picnic at Lone Pine, California. This was around 1:30 p.m. when we sighted an unusual object. 

The object appeared to be a jet airplane going maneuvers - but it's speed and maneuvers were so great that we thought they would tear the plane apart. It was traveling at a terrific rate of speed - back and forth - up and down - weaving in and out of the mountains. It would disappear completely and then reappear a half mile away in a split second. The object seemed to have shot out of whatever it was doing - and would come back to the original spot the same way. 

At times it would appear to stop completely - then dart off at tremendous speeds. The object seemed to have shot out of some lower altitude cloud bank and return diving back into the same cloud bank - moving in an up and down and back and forth pattern. It was making very sharp impossible turns. The whole performance lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes and was completely out of the ordinary.

Buena Park, California
January 23, 1965

Dear Sir:

My purpose in writing is to report an unidentified flying object observed in Central California on the evening of August 29, 1964.

My Dad, an aeronautical engineer, and I were standing outside looking up at the sky at around 10:30 P.M. when we saw something strange come down from Mt. Whitney. The time was approximately 10:30 P.M. when we sighted an unusual object.

The object appeared to be a jet airplane against a moonlit sky. However, but it's speed and maneuvers were much greater than any jet aircraft known. It moved rapidly in straight lines, then made extremely sharp turns, sometimes appearing to stop momentarily, then resume its flight. It seemed larger than any commercial jet and was perfectly silent. This was no satellite, no shooting star, no airplane - it was a completely unidentified flying object.

The object was visible for approximately 30 seconds. It seemed to be about 15,000 feet in altitude when we first sighted it. Then it suddenly streaked off at a tremendous speed and was out of sight.

It would move down a couple of degrees, then stop, then move up a couple of degrees, stop, then move rapidly off in another direction. The maneuvers were incredible and the speed unbelievable. There was no exhaust, no glow, no sound at all. It was a strange, silent, fast-moving aerial object.

The object seemed to have no specific purpose or direction. It just seemed to be maneuvering, first one way then another, in a random fashion. Its size appeared larger than any commercial plane, and it was definitely not an aircraft of any kind known to us.

We got down to our camp at 12,000 feet at 0300 hours. We noticed two more of these objects in the clear side of the first one. They came to about 800 yards and five distance, Away more to the first object twice in the distance seconds to becom. They did when we turn to look at it away, motion object and we at once. These objects about 1600 p.m. and we still 12,000 observed.
Will you please tell me what you saw. If you need more information, I will be glad to furnish it.
Sincerely yours.
