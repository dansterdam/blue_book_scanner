11. COMMENTS
This report is one of the more significant cases investigated by this witness, principally because of the unusual character of the object's appearance and behavior. The witness is considered to be reliable, and his account is considered to be reasonably accurate. The case is considered to be of substantial interest and warrants further study.

The image provided does not contain any visual elements or photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text found in the document:

Captain Wright is of the opinion that the object was not a meteor, It was traveling at about half mile per second. He thinks it could be an experimental missile or some unknown object. He seemed to be quite convinced that the object was not a missile or any known type of aircraft. He described the object as being cigar shaped and greenish in color. It seemed to be surrounded by some type of luminous glow. The object was observed for approximately one minute.

The image contains two sketches depicting UFO sightings. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the object's path across the sky, with an arrow pointing at the location of the object. The second sketch shows two side-by-side images - one depicting a larger view of the object in the sky, and the other showing a smaller sketch that is likely an example of the object's positioning.

Text extracted from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared in the sky. Indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
