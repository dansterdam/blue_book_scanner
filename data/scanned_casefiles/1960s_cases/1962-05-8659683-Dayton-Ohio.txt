10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Shiny gray obj observed for 5 mins moving from West to East. Disappeared behind a cloud. Observation in car near 25 mph. Initial observation at 45 degs, crossing zenith and disappearance at 15 degs. Gave impression of satellite appearance. Moving slower than a/c. Appeared very high.
