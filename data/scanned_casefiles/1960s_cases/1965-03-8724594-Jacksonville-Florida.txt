BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Very bright light or flash, reported as a meteor or flash. The witness stated it appeared to be about 45-50 degrees elevated above them. He observed it for only a very short period. The light was very bright, but no sound was reported. The object disappeared as quickly as it appeared. The witness, who was one of several observers, was convinced the observation was of a meteor.
