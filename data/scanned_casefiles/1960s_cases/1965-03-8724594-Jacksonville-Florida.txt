THE OBJECT COULD POSSIBLE BE A METEORITE OR SATELLITE BURNING. THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE FLASH NEGATES THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOON SIGHTING. CAPE KENNEDY, EGLIN AFB, OR TYNDALL AFB COULD NOT ATTRIBUT THE INCIDENT TO ANY OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.

NO INCIDENTS REPORTED BY ARS. SIMULTANEOUS SIGHTING BY ALL AIRCRAFT, SHORT DURATION, AND LACK OF RADAR DETECTION SUPPORT THIS POSSIBILITY.
