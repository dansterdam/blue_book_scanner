15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes NO Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    12 October 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

During the 30 minutes that we watched, the object its light changed from green to red to white. Its actions as it retraced its path then go forward from slow to fast, then to a crawl and then speed up and suddenly stop, and the right angles it made were amazing to my family. They remarked that to take such rest the pilot had too much to drink. My impression of the object while I watched was that it acted as though it was excited about something.

At 10:30 P.M. my son and his family started to go home, and as they left the driveway the object started to come toward us. My first thought was to call my son while he was driving, but decided not to startle him or his family were in the car. I took my position in the yard.

The object stopped in front of a tall chimney above the railroad tracks opposite our back yard. It was tilted and the windows and brilliant light were the first things seen as it descended. Then it leveled itself and the outline and column separate, the windows were clear.

and distinct, also the dome above and
under the object.

The first 2 minutes we admired the object
and the exclamation that we made during the
3rd minute while the object was maneuvering seem
to phase it away, because suddenly the object
took flight in great speed.

The man called the radio stations and
the second radio station told him that they received
another call about the object and directed him to
call the Airport. Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport called ... some summary and we were told to
write a letter about this experience explaining about
what we saw.

I called my [redacted] and told him what I
saw etc. He told me that as he was driving or
walking toward home, the glanced in the
direction of my home and saw a huge-brilliant
light, above my home, I told him it was close
but the light he saw was in front of the
factory tall chimney.

P.S. On Oct. 9, 1965. While working on question 18 inch
questionnaire, I stepped outside to test the distance
and saw a similar object that stayed in the distance
exactly same position as the other object I had
seen on Sept. 9, 1965.

20 min in view from 10:35 P.M. to 11:25 P.M.

Report of phone call made on January 14 to Mrs. [redacted]. The witness, one of several, seemed of good reliability. There is a possibility that the object sighted was an advertising plane flying over a local football field where a game was in progress. Also the description of the trajectory made by the witness did not support this. The fact that this was by only one group of witnesses in a metropolitan area in the early evening of the summer night makes the entire case suspect. It is likely, therefore, that an advertising plane was misidentified as a flying saucer.

Cleveland 2, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

On the evening of Sept. 4, 1965 at 10 o'clock my family and I noticed a white, moving object in the sky. We thought it was satellites, but as it moved a short distance it stopped and retracted its path. Its light changed from green to red and then to white again.

We were guessing if it was an airplane or a white balloon. When a gust of wind blew the object tumbled against it several times. The object then traveled forward very slowly and with great speed at times. It seemed to have a path and stopped. Then it speeded forward and made a right angle up-wards, retarded it very slowly, then tumbled a short distance, straight down out of sight, then back in view.

After watching for 30 minutes the object traveled swiftly in a straight line toward us. About 216 feet above the railroad track close to a tall chimney of a factory off-set to our left, it stopped.
