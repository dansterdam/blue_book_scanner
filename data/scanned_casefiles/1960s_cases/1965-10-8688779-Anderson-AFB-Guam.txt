1. (U) The information included in FAA message CONF/NO PORN/DI 00327 Jul 66 has been evaluated, and the following comments are submitted:

a. (U) The data as submitted does not lend itself to analysis of individual tracks as such. This is not necessarily a drawback, since individual track data would probably not be of significant help in analyzing the situation.

b. (C) Considering the overall situation as such, several facts appear obvious on the face of the report. Pitas, since telescopers or other evidence of the presence of material objects, it can be concluded that radar indications are causing the returns (as contrasted with returns from weather fronts). Comparing various variations (in the atmosphere, etc.), then this material objects are at some other location than the indicated by the track. Second, the fact that some 125 returns were received eliminates many of the usual causes for false returns, and almost certainly indicates the nature of the returns. (Under normal conditions, it is conceivable that maintenance shows causing equipment, or some activity unrelated to the problem could yield returns that are not considered likely.)

c. (C) If a. and b. are correct, one explanation for this type of return would be multiple range returns; i.e., second-, third-, or fourth-time-around returns. This is feasible because the transmission is a one-way transmission, rather than two-way as is normal for radar returns. This would also explain why a plane painting on the target - an aircraft broadside could have a radar cross section matching the normal airborne radar image. Flickering or disappearing skin balance would be caused by the nature of the returns. The PPI would still be triggered, however, and the coded return would remain.

d. (C) Simultaneous loss of the target by several radars and some of the target speeds not usually associated with aircraft could be due to ducting, and changes in either the atmosphere with would change the ducting, or due to the aircraft responsible for the returns flying out of the area. Extraordinary high or low speeds can sometimes be attributed to the geometry of the reflecting or refracting pattern.

e. (C) The presence of the Soviet trawler is not believed to play a part in this situation. If the signal was originating in the trawler, it would be easy to PY on the source, which would then make the answer obvious. Preliminary checks indicate from the trawler would not provide returns that would synchronize with other radars observing the returns, and the persona would not be logical and probably not be recognizable.

2. (U) This evaluation does not attempt to answer, item for item, the statement of events in the incoming message. Since it is obvious that material (soil) areas are not involved, we have tried a reason out how the conditions could happen.

INFORMATIVE OBSERVATION WAS MADE 27 JUN 66, AT 1445Z WITH A SIGNIFICANT AIR INTERCEPT. PART II. FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS HAS BEEN MADE OF THIS PHENOMENA:

ALFA. THREE FOURTHS OF THE OCCURRENCES WERE AT NIGHT. BRAVO. AVERAGE TIME ON SCOPE WAS APPROX TEN MINUTES. COCA. ALL DISPLAYED AS BEACON IFF MODE THREE WITH VARIOUS CODES, NO CORRELATION TO COURSE. ONE THIRD ALSO DISPLAYED INTERMITTENT SKIN PAINT. DELTA. OVER HALF WERE FIRST DETECTED WITHIN 10NM OF ANDERSEN AFB 350/33NM. ONLY ONE RETURN OVERFLEW THE NORTH COAST OF GUAM BEFORE TURNING OUTBOUND. IN MOST CASES CLOSEST APPROACH WAS 25NM NORTH OF GUAM. ALL BUT TWO HAD NORTHWEST EXIT TRACKS. THREE FOURTHS HAD EXIT HDG 310 DEGREES PLUS MINUS 10 DEGREES. ECHO. APPARENT GROUND SPEED READOUT MADE 20 TIMES. MAX SPEED WAS APPROX 500K, MIN SPEED 40K. EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT WERE LESS THAN 250K.

FOXTROT. FIVE ALTITUDE READOUTS WERE OBTAINED, WITH READINGS FROM 20,000 TO 1,000 FEET NOTED. GOLF. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE TYPICAL FOR THIS AREA AND NOT A FACTOR WITH RADAR BEACON RETURNS.

PART III. INTERCEPT ATTEMPTS WERE MADE 23 JUN 66, AT 0300Z (1900 LOCAL) USING AIRBORNE KC-135 AND C-97 ACFT. THE KC-135 WAS AT 15,000 FEET IN THE CLEAR, WITH THE BEACON PHENOMENA

AT 20,000 FEET. NO SIGHTING WAS MADE. THE C-97 WAS VFR AT 4,600
FEET, SAME ALTITUDE AS MEASURED AT THAT TIME FOR THE BEACON
PHENOMENON, AND PASSED DIRECTLY OVER IT OR INTO IT TWICE
WITHOUT VISUAL CONTACT. PART IV. AN ADDITIONAL INTERCEPT
ATTEMPT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO DATE, WAS MADE 27 JUN 66, AT
1443Z (23/0645 LOCAL) BY AN ANDERSEN AFB AIR RESCUE SQUADRON
C-130, CALL SIGN PILE 75, EQUIPPED WITH APS-59. PILOTS WERE CAPT
JOE KRAUPKA AND CAPT PETE GLEESON; VERY RELIABLE AND OBJECTIVE
OBSERVERS. CONTACT WAS MAINTAINED FOR TWENTY MINUTES AT
APPROX 2,000 FEET, AND NUMEROUS INTERCEPTS WERE ATTEMPTED.

IT WAS A CLEAR MOONLIT NIGHT WITH SCATTERED CUMULUS AT FLIGHT
LEVEL WHICH WAS TOO THIN TO PAINT ON THE RADAR. FOLLOWING
SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WERE REPORTED BY THE FLIGHT CREW: ALFA. THE
CREW USED "PENCIL BEAM" ON THEIR APS-59 RADAR, GIVING ACCURATE
HOMING CAPABILITY. BRAVO. RADAR CONTACT MAX RANGE WAS 6NM.

THE RETURN WAS IN THE FORM OF A NARROW SERIES OF DOTS SUCH AS AN
ELECTRICAL IMPULSE WOULD GIVE. IT WAS APPROX ONE NM LONG ON
THE SCOPE AND ALWAYS ORIENTED IN LINE WITH THE CENTER OF THE
RADAR SCOPE. COCA. VECTORS CALLED BY THE GROUND RADAR

CONTROLLER CHECKED PERFECTLY WITH THE RETURN IDENTIFIED ON THE
AIRBORNE RADAR. A THIRD RADAR FPS-6 HEIGHT FINDER ALSO WAS IN OPERATION
AND HAD THE RETURN. DELTA. THE CREW HOMED IN ON AND FLEW THROUGH
THE RETURN REPEATEDLY WITH NO VISUAL CONTACT. THEY REPORTED THAT
THERE SEEMED TO BE A CLOUD ASSOCIATED WITH THE TARGET AT ALL TIMES,
AND NEVER THE SAME CLOUD. WHENEVER THEY TRIED TO SPOT IT VISUALLY
IT WAS ALWAYS IN A CLOUD. ECHO. THE TARGET WAS LOST TO BOTH THE
FAA AND AIRBORNE RADAR AT THE SAME TIME, 1515Z. AT THAT TIME IT WAS
322/56NM FROM ANDERSEN AFB. PART V. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS
APPLICABLE, REQUIRED BY AFR 200-2, IS SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: (A)
MULTIPLE RETURNS WERE NOTED ONLY ONCE, 19 JUN 56 1445Z, WHEN ONE
RETURN BECAME STATIONARY AND WAS JOINED BY A SECOND BEACON AND
INTERMITTENT SKIN PAINT RETURN TO WITHIN ONE HALF MILE OF EACH
OTHER. THE FIRST RETURN APPEARED TO ORIGINATE FROM A SURFACE VESSEL
AT 1433Z. ONLY REPORTED INCIDENT OF THIS. RETURNS MOVED AWAY
AND WERE AT ANDERSEN 322/58 AND 322/64 WHEN CONTACT WAS LOST ON
BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME, 1459Z. (B) RETURNS WERE FIRST NOTED
4 OCT 65 BY THE ANDERSEN AFB FAA SURVEILLANCE RADAR OPERATORS. AT
FIRST THERE WAS A POSSIBLE CORRELATION TO ARC LIGHT LAUNCHES

The document is marked as UNCLASSIFIED and appears to be a military report about radar returns observed near Andersen Air Force Base.
