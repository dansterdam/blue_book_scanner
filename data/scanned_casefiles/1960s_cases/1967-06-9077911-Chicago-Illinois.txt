My Dear Sir:

Perhaps you have already received letters about this, but I had not been aware that I was an eye witness until advised by Mr. ______ on June 16th.

On approximately June 16th or 17th, I was walking my dog at about 10:00 p.m. As I was approaching my residence on ______ Avenue, suddenly in the southwest sky I saw a very bright light or object which appeared to be travelling toward the northwest. It did not have the characteristics of an aircraft, but seemed to be a very large, brilliantly lighted object or source of light, and traveled without sound or visible form.

I watched it closely then, and saw that it came to a point near the horizon and then reversed itself and traveled back toward the southeast. It did this twice in the space of about 3 minutes. At no time did it come into the cone of light from the street lights or any other light in any way. 

Then suddenly the searchlight beam was not addicted so that its path could be traced. It just disappeared, and I never saw it again. I then continued my walk without seeing or hearing anything further.

It was planned, as nearly as I can describe it, as the disc and bottom of what appeared to be a concave saucer. Its color was a uniform white, but very brilliant and intense. And it seemed to be illuminated from within so that there was no projection of light from it or shadow upon the ground. It traveled without sound, without apparent propulsion or any visible means of navigation. It simply seemed to move under its own power, and then without seeming effort it would reverse direction.

Seem to make a turn, when it made its reverses back and forth at the same speed, as if playing the between two points.

I could not identify the object which had its red glow below, the cloud sailing behind it and a bright flash beam clicked up the clouds, which continued to make changes in its form, gradually became longer and narrower. Its center was about the length of a jet aircraft at this point, which appeared much higher and were of no aircraft at this point. I was not close enough to estimate it's exact size, but it did move all the way to O'Hare.

I apologize for the delay; I had this handwritten in preparation, when I met with an accident (eye-operation) and hospitalization for a while. The description and timing are unchanged.

Respectfully,

Dear Sir:

This letter is in regard to your letter of September 27, 1967 to ... regarding an unidentified flying object sighting over Chicago, Illinois. 

I am employed by Mr. ... and take all incoming telephone calls for the Pal-Waukee Airport during the hours 11:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M. About 1:00 A.M. on 10 September 1967, a girl telephoned this past summer (don't recall her name) who lives in the Illinois area. She said that she and her friend had completed their working shift at 11:00 P.M. The observed this lighted object in the sky to the southeast. She said that it had to be over Pal-Waukee or Chicago and asked if we could see it.

I could see the object she was speaking of and told her it looked like it was directly over the city of Chicago.

I am familiar with aircraft displaying landing lights. The lights are pronounced and the aircraft can readily visible. From the information she gave me, it was between 3,000 to 5,000 feet directly over the Chicago Loop or to an area one or two miles inland. It had an outline similar to one and one half times as large as if looking at an aircraft with lights on. The lights were within the confines of this outline however. Her description of the lights gave me the impression light bulbs, perhaps 15 to 30 minutes, and being exhausted it again retire.

I was positive it could be seen from her area, and I could observe it as vividly from Pal-Waukee. I was positive it could be seen by the O'Hare Tower personnel or some time pilot.
