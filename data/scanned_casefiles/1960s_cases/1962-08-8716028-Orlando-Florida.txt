ATTN OF: SMEDS                                                  13 August 1962

SUBJECT: Unidentified Object

TO: ATIC Center
     Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. The enclosed object was sent to this detachment by a man who said he saw something explode in the air and a piece of it fell into his swimming pool. He believes the object may be part of a meteorite and has requested that we want to identify it.

2. The McCoy AFB Information Office advised us to forward the object to you. If additional information is required, it can be contacted at the above address.

ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
ASRC/PA

SUBJECT
Samples from Florida, Chicago and Washington

TEST NO
(1) 10,24 (2) 10,27 (3) 10,22 &

TASK NO
C771 (146)

SUBMITTED BY
Nat'l Ground ASA

DATE RECEIVED
16 Oct 62

PURPOSE
To do Spectrographic

FACTUAL DATA
Florida - 10-22 - Spectrographic analysis
showed the material to be principally silicon. The
sample appears to be earth in character by this presence of
scale X-ray configuration S.O. only.

Ohio - 10-22 - Spectrographic analysis showed
the material to be low alloy steel.

Washington - 10-22 - Spectrographic analysis showed
the material to be type 302 aluminum alloy.

CONCLUSIONS
None
