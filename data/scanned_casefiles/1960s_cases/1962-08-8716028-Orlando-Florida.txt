11. COMMENTS - Investigator's note: Per caller, the lights appeared in pairs or groups of 3-5, were round or oval in shape, very bright orange in color, and moving at a fairly high speed. The caller did not think they were flares or aircraft, but could not describe them further. ATIC evaluation: The lights were probably a cluster of burning or chemically-ignited balloons, but insufficient data for definite determination.

TO: Maj Janger
DEFENSE AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
The attached object was sighted, to the best of my knowledge, to be a real, physical object. It flew into his swimming pool. He believes the object may be part of some type of military device. 
Attached is information to forward the object to the correct UFO information center for analysis, if advisable.
