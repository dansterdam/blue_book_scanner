PROJECT 10073 RECORD

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 14 August 65 15/0125Z
2. LOCATION: Newport News, Virginia
3. SOURCE: Military
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 45 - 90 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Erratic to NE
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

10. CONCLUSION: I SATELLITE
Duration, direction of flight, and apparent speed of object in second with conversion. Apparent change in direction and brightness attributed to passage near stars. Object dim.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Round object like a star. Reflected sunlight, yellow to orange color. Observer looking at Northern Cross. During the sighting the object changed intensity and appeared to gain in magnitude with each change in course. Ground visual. No optical data. 45-90 seconds under observation. Sighting at 2125 Local. Slightly within Cygnus Object very dim, between 2.5 and 4.5 stellar magnitude. Course changes very abrupt.

Sunset at 1852, and Astro Twilight 2027. Conversion for DST and Longitude Sunset 1956, End of Twilight 2136. Sun had set for 31 minutes. Object would be at over 100 miles altitude in order to reflect sunlight. Assumed source of light therefore NOT reflected sunlight. Object passed through approximately 10 degrees of arc.

1. The following information is forwarded in accordance with para-
graph 4, AFR 200-2.

a. Description of Object:
(1) Shape: Round, as compared to a star.
(2) Size: Pin.
(3) Color: Reflected sunlight - yellow to orange.
(4) Number: One.
(5) Formation: None.
(6) Discernible features: None.
(7) Tail: None.
(8) Sound: None.

b. Description of Course of Object:
(1) Observer was in his backyard observing the "Northern
Cross" constellation at the time of sighting. Since he is quite
familiar with astronomy the brilliance of the object and the
presence of an additional "star" were very noticeable.

(2) See observer's map (attached with letter).

(5) Observer claims that with each change of course the object appeared to gain in magnitude of brightness until it suddenly disappeared towards the north.

(6) The approximate time of the last observation was 2125 EDT. The object was traced through the course for a period of 45-90 seconds.

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Observation was made from the ground with the naked eye.
(2) No optical aids were used.
(3) N/A.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) 15 August 1965, 0125z.
(2) Night sighting with stars of 5th magnitude visible. Weather clear.

e. Location of Observer:
(1) Newport News, Va.

f. Identifying Information on Observer:
(1) Military, Arthur L. Corten, E-9, U. S. Naval Guided Missiles School, Dam Neck, Va. High probability of reliability of report.

An analysis of the object would be difficult since the observer obviously is familiar with the subject of astronomy. I would suggest that a qualified person determine, at the time of the sighting, whether the sun was still in a position to reflect objects at an altitude down to 38,000 feet (the position of the tropopause). The observer started that the one object was extremely high (as per balloon), however, to an unpracticed eye any determination of altitude is difficult. I feel that he had sighted a weather research or research balloon at an altitude of 35,000 feet or greater which would account for the great "g" factor stated in the one object would cause experience.

1. Existence of Physical Evidence: None.
