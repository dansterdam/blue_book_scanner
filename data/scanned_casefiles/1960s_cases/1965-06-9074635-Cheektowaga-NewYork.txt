Gentlemen;

As I have read many books about flying saucers, I came across the book, "Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force," by LT. COL. Lawrence J. Tacker, U.S.A.F. In it you requested that anyone with any information to please write in, so I decided I would.

On Thursday, June 10, 1965, I spotted a flying object that I would consider a flying saucer. It was somewhat V shaped, left no vapor trail, and it was white in color with a blinking effect.

I hope this information will be of some use to you.

I would also appreciate it very much if you could send me any more information on flying saucers.

I would appreciate a reply very much.

Sincerely yours,

FRA:LLL
