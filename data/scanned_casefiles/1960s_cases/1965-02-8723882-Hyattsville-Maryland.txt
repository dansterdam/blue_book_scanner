LOCATION: Hyattsville, Maryland
SOURCE: Civilian
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1 Min 30 Seconds
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
COURSE: NE
PHOTOS: No
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Bright day, clear sky. Solid object sharply outlined, erratic motion in stationary portion and sudden burst of speed. Hovering occupied about 1 minute of the observation at which time the object disappeared by ascending into space until no longer visible. View blocked by buildings. Speed estimated at 800-900 mph. Distance from observer 300 yds. Initial observation at 50 deg elevation in SW. Flight moving to 90 deg elevation in NE. Initial flight in descent. Hover, then ascent.

COMMENTS: Probable a/c observation. No data presented to indicate that the sighting could NOT have been caused by an a/c. Hovering considered an illusion. Witness concept of distance and angles of elevation was well as duration vague and inconclusive. If there was an actual object that indicated the report, it is likely that an a/c was the cause.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Thursday February 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

At approximately 3:30 p.m. on February 13, 1965, I was in the Pentagon lot just adjacent to Prince George's lot flying. When it appeared to look up. At this time I saw the object: It was moving at great speed, about descending. It then hovered in mid-air, for approximately one minute. I did not note whether or not the craft had windows or any kind. There were several other people in the parking lot, at least one of which saw it.

It was a woman with a small child. After observing for about a minute, the object ascended. The last I saw of it, it disappeared behind the Federal Building which, from my angle of view, obstructed it.

The most accurate feature about the craft was: the fact that it didn't accelerate and de-stabilize gradually, but simply took off. If there was any acceleration to mention, it was too fast for me to notice it. The second was its size; it appeared to be approximately 4 or 5 times larger than a passenger jet. The was no wing or body of any kind.
