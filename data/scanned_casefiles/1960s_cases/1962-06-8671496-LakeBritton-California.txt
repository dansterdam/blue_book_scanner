Dear Sirs:

On a recent trip in Modoc County, we were camped near Lake Britton about 9:30 on evening of Tuesday, June 12th when we saw an odd thing happen. We would like to know if this is some "natural thing" that has been recorded before, or if it is something "secret" that should not be talked about. (We are members of a "rockhound club" and often give talks on things we see.)

Shortly before 9:30, we noticed a "shooting star"...then right at 9:30 another came from same direction...which we thought sort of odd.

A few minutes later another went over...and about that time we realized ALL had come from same place in sky...and vanished at same spot after a trip "half way" across. I got the clock and started timing the objects. They were quite regular in appearance in north, northwest area, coming about every ten minutes for several trips, then seeming to miss one interval. The next was in proper time, then three came in a five minute space, then two during next ten minute space, then back to ten minute intervals again. These objects had an odd fluttering flight. Then about ten minutes to twelve, an object came from the north...almost right angles to "flight pattern"...crossed the line of flight of the "stars"...This object was clear red, did not flutter.

It seemed to hover, or stop in place, then seemed to face to a faint red glow...then suddenly passed directly back in direction it came from, glowed a moment in place and seemed to "go out".

Here is the text from the document:

We made the remark that " Well missed, this time, next time around we'll make the strike!"...then our "star" came by again, the red object had moved over toward the eastern "side of north"... and made a sharp pass. "On a collision course" it seemed. The "star" seemed to stop a little short of where it had been passing from view, the red object glowed in place for a good moment...then all vanished! I stayed awake until 1:30...this was twelve o'clock, midnight, yet no more stars "fell" or "shot" that I could see.

My only guess is, -that there were several objects in "sequence" (except that one was out of "time") That we saw two because they were high enough for the morning (?) sun to shine on them and they seemed to vanish as they got between us and the sun. ( I think they would have to be pretty high to catch the sun this way...could I have an estimate how high this would be?? )

Two years ago a young friend was staying with us here on the hill and at that time we also saw lots of stars "fall" and noticed that a lot seemed to come from north...he went to bed facing a north window and suddenly yelled out that, "ONE shot the other!" I did not see this but did see the great increase in light. This too was about 12 at night.

Another thing we, or I, at least, have noticed. An odd "hum" or rather a vibration that one seems to FEEL when what we thought was the satellite was going over. I have good glasses, this "thing" surely is no common plane (has a most beautiful light) but is a "satellite" supposed to "hum"?? Last time I saw this was 2 A.M. the 25th of June. Thought I heard the "hum" again about 9: 25.

May we have information? Thank you.
