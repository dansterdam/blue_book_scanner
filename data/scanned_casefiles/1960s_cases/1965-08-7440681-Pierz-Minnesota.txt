Dear Sirs:

Last August, while my father and I were outside doing our evening chores, I was gazing at the stars. I often do this but I noticed an unusual light that evening, and called it to the attention of my father.

The light appeared near the constellation Draco and went swiftly across the sky. The odd thing about it was that it "pulsated" or blinked swiftly, about three or four times a second. It would become bright, then dim, then bright again.

It went faster than any satellite I have ever seen, although it appeared about the same size. I doubt if it was an airplane, because a plane would have to be pretty close to the ground to go across the sky that fast. Yet we heard nothing.

We stood there, commenting on what it could be, when suddenly the light faded out in the constellation Cassiopea. We observed the light for about ten seconds.

We have formed no opinion on what this thing might have been. I am writing to you in the hope you might give a theory on this object. I would have written sooner but I just obtained the correct address from a newspaper article. Unlike some people, I am confident you are hiding nothing from the general public, and I am sure you will explain this light to the best of your ability.

Cordially yours,
