MEMO FOR THE RECORD: Phone Conversation of 5 Aug 65

Jim Schrout, area code 304, phone 738-9000, extension 8383.

Allegheny Ballistics,. In placing phone call inform operator not to change the area code to 301 as listed in her book but to use area code 304.

Reference the rocket parts that were found in Thailand, would like to know where it was found and when it came down. Object supposedly fell sometime in May. This part is all that we know that fell. Object was launched from Wallops Island, 16 Dec 64, Scout Mission, San Marco Vehicle, and was a joint effort with the Italians on an air density program. Payload was expected to orbit for six months. Rocket would have had to complete at least six orbits before it could have fallen in Thailand. Now they are wondering if the Payload was near this object when it came down, as it was supposed to come down separately (the rocket body that is) at an earlier date and had been expected to burn up. They are photographing the object, will probably turn the object over to NASA. He will send us a complete report on the object.

1. The Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB has received a report, of an alleged unidentified flying object, from the US Advisory Group in Thailand. The object which "fell from the sky" and was recovered by the Royal Thai Air Force, appears to be part of a US rocket.

The referenced object has been critically examined by personnel within BSD and cannot be positively identified. From markings observed on the individual parts, it is suspected that they are a product of the Allegheny Ballistic Laboratory. It is probably one of their I-254, 258, or 259 series solid motors utilized as the third stage on a Scout Rocket.
