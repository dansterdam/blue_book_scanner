I. The foreign telescope sights ex amined were torn from the broken scope of a foreign anti-tank AT rifle about T.B.W. as TE EB by AT force that caused the sights to be torn off or broken away from the scope as against the normal process of dis assembly,

2. The marks on the telescope parts are such that they appear to have been subjected at some time to hydrauliclike force or pressure applied to them. This could result from the force exerted by an explosive charge or the impact of the scope with some hard object.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed memo or document detailing a phone conversation about an object that was launched from Wallops Island on December 16, 1964. The document discusses the details of the object, including that it was expected to burn up on re-entry, but the object was not behaving as expected. The memo states that NASA will provide a complete report on the object.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: Phone Conversation of 5 Aug 69

Jim Schrout, area code 304, phone 733-9000, extension 2393. Allegheny Airlines: In placing phone call inform operator not to change the area code to 301 as listed in her book but to use area code 304.

Reference the pocket parts that were found in Thailand, would like to know where it was found and when it came down. Object supposedly fell sometime in May. This part is all that we know that fell. Object was launched from Wallops Island, 16 Dec 64, Scout Mission, SV-5C Vehicle, and was a joint effort with the Italians on an air density program. Payload was expected to orbit for six months. Rocket would have had to complete at least five orbits before it could have fallen in Thailand. Now they are wondering if the Payload was near this object when it came down, as it was supposed to come down separately (the rocket body that is) at an earlier date and had been expected to burn up. They are photographing the object, will probably turn the object over to NASA. He will send us a complete report on the object.

Thailand merely woke me up about 1:00 As usual bright as ever.
It seems cleared up thirty minutes Lnd stayed that way.
At 1:30 called the Duty Offr.

1. The Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB has evaluated a report, of an unidentified flying object which was observed on 25 May 1965 from the US Advisory Group in Thailand. The object, which "fell" from the Royal Thai Air Force, appears to be part of the igniting mechanism of a US Rocket.

2. We would appreciate your assistance in identifying the object in order that an adequate reply may be made to the US Advisory Group.

1. The referenced object has been critically examined by personnel within BSD utilizing all available analytical means. Based on the accumulated data, it is suspected that they are a product of the Allegheny Ballistic Laboratory. It is probably one of their X-24A, 22A, or 22V series solid motors utilized as the third stage on a Scout rocket.
