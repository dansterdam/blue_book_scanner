27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object was during the course. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Object appeared about NW (true North), then moved almost over me (directly slightly to North) and the last of saw it was almost due East.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? One - which had several parts.

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The light I saw at first appeared to be a bright star - or a satellite reflecting sunlight. However, it was about 8:30 PM, too late to catch that rays of sun. Upon getting my binoculars and going inside to observe the object, I could see about 4 sources of light in a group. Each looked like the open end of a red-hot kerosene stove - a ring of fire. I thought of possibilities of my observing the exhaust from an airplane, but I could study it more with that arrangement of power plants. It was coming from the west, traveled due east. Distant from where first observed.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    27    March    1967
                                              Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Ref. 13-c. After I had been watching the four sources' light, a while, one seemed to go out. I then took a look at it instead of my binoculars then, and the light seemed dimmer, and if thought I saw a streak of fire or something burning drop under it. Watching again with period, I saw a streak of flame or burning object fall from group of lights and drop down continued in an erratic path.

13-a. Total light left was diminished again. I lowered my glasses again to check with eyes only, and the brightness diminished again as a burning or glowing object fell away from it. Again using binoculars I then the light again, and it seemed to be down to just one dim light source or ring, and thus suddenly went out as I watched. Then as I continued to watch that area it seemed to distinguish a silvery or silken looking parachute or balloon reflecting light from city below. By this time the object had drifted to the east of Tempe several miles and was about as high about the horizon on that side, as it had been on the N.W. when first observed.

Discussing the matter with Capt. Redding of USAF Headquarters, he believe that this was probably a hot air balloon experiment, powered by several candles on a suspended platform inside it. The "ring" type effect is noted would be the light diffusion around the candle when seen through clear or milky spectral. (over)

Friends to whom I related my tale the next day (perhaps) seeing an article in the morning paper recently regarding students in L.A. area making these hot air balloon #2 experiments and thus my well have induced some local people to try the same thing.

I might add that Capt. Redding's investigation of this matter has been a credit to the Air Force. He was courteous but thorough in questions, and afterward related to me what further he had found out (not much!) about the matter.

If I can be of any further help, please let me know.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?    While watching the object with binoculars, the light appeared to be in yet part service, and then I watched, and the entire object became invisible after 15-20 minutes. (Not clearly)

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    YES    NO    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what
got my binoculars to observe it was closely - distinguished it from just a small a star.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I believe a "country match" head would have just covered the light.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Appeared similar to satellite (Echo, etc.) I have seen early evening some time back. Had an appearance of swinging or unreal progress such as the satellite 'did'. However, at rest a more red color - thought of maybe a point in the sky. Was in vicinity of white, it moved behind just plain trees in neighborhood just two feet & a planet or star. Then got my bearings out to get closer look.
