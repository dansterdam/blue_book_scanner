not could be less material, we think, or less sure of only 
after an intense survey of the particular area of the sky, 
when a tiny black speck could be seen. This black speck was 
much like a jet being observed at the maximum distance, then 
in the sky. The elevation was still about 45 above the horizon.

The black speck seemed to remain stationary and dart out 
of our range to, we took in a wide course for Mitchell such 
a time. After two or three minutes, speck moved over his 
left shoulder and noted that the black speck was becoming 
larger and, immediately changed course to head directly toward 
the black speck, which continued to close, or become larger.

As the site increased, speck faded to see flickering red and 
green lights, along the upper surface. Really could not sub- 
stantiate this. The lights, if any, were of such low intensity 
and duration as to be extremely difficult to see. At this 
point, there was excitement in the cockpit and eager to assure 
among the lights.

As the object continued to approach or grow larger, the 
position was observed again, and the tiny speck began 
to grow and the main body distorted until it was gone. To

together or a mile. Continuing on a course directly for the 
object, it as seemed to keep up into space 15 seconds

SACM 55-14

CHAPTER 1
USAF HIGH ALTITUDE REFUELING AREAS

1. Purpose: To provide SAC crews and operations planning staffs with complete information concerning the high altitude refueling area. Effectively utilization of this information will permit air refueling to be conducted with a minimum of planning and will ensure maximum utilization of aircraft.

2. Concept of Operation:

a. Except as specified in the following paragraph, all SAC high altitude refueling operations will be confined to the published high altitude refueling areas within the Continental Control Area. There are as have been established as reserved airspace. During a scheduled refueling period, other TFR assigned altitude traffic will not be cleared by FAA through an active refueling area.

b. The following procedures have been established to warn VFR and VFR-on-top traffic of all refueling operations:

(1) The areas are published in the Airman's Guide and USAF Aeronautical Publications. The description of the high altitude refueling areas published in the Airman's Guide will be considered the official document. Changes supplementing the Airman's Guide are automatic per and in revisions to SACM 55-14. Periodic revisions to this manual will reflect the current data in the Airman's Guide.

(2) FAA Flight Service Stations include in scheduled broadcasts the fact that air refueling is being conducted in specified areas.

(3) FAA Flight Service Stations issue flight advisory information to VFR traffic known to be operating in the vicinity of active refueling areas.

c. It is recognized that certain essential training and tactical requirements such as large scale mission and non-route exercises cannot be confined to established areas, either in time, altitude, or location. These missions will be held to the absolute minimum and require for waiver will be approved by this headquarters only on an individual basis in accordance with the following:

(1) Missions will utilize the established areas expanded as required in preference to wholly new areas.

(2) Missions will be conducted on altitude reservation flight plans.

(3) Only priority #7 missions, as defined in SACM 65-3, or higher will be approved. When approved, this headquarters will validate the requirement to CARF.

3. Scheduling Procedures. Controlling agencies of refueling areas will closely monitor the tracks/heading being utilized to insure safe separation between refueling operations. Receiver aircraft

will not enter the area unless radio or electronic rendezvous equipment contact has been established with the respective tanker. The following ground rules are established for the tanker aircraft:

a. Normal Procedures. A complete daily refueling schedule for each refueling area shall be submitted by the scheduling units at an agreed time to the nearest ARTC Centers 24 hours in advance. The schedule will contain the following data on each tanker and receiver aircraft: identification, type, estimated time of entry at entrance point, flight level, estimated time of arrival and exit point, and military or FAA circuit available.

(1) Normally only one group of published flight levels, 240-290 or 310-340, will be scheduled for concurrent use in the same area. Whenever possible, the top altitude of the upper group will be established at 330 to permit other enroute utilization of flight level 350.

(2) Each refueling area will have a specific military unit assigned the responsibility for coordinating with each scheduling unit.

(3) Military units, when flight-planning an altitude reservation that will traverse a published refueling area, will be required to obtain approval from the scheduling unit and will no indicate the altitude reservations which do not indicate that approval has been obtained to transit the re-route area. The scheduling unit will ensure that the daily refueling schedule does not contain refueling operations which conflict with the approved altitude reservation.

(4) The scheduling unit will notify the assigned ARTC Center of subsequent cancellations as soon as this information is available.

(5) The FAA will consider the tanker and receiver aircraft as one aircraft from point of hookup to point of breakoff for position reporting and separation purposes. The ARTC Center will, when required, clear other IFR traffic at assigned flight levels through published refueling areas, provided such IFR traffic can be separated by use of ANG or radar separation standards.

(6) The FAA will reserve only those flight levels in the refueling area that are requested in advance through the SAC coordinating unit. The flight plans submitted by the refueling units must contain the same flight levels. The flight levels applied by FAA are IFR/VFR-on-top. Do not use IFR/VFR-on-top flight plan in the high altitude refueling areas.

b. For Single and Dual Track Areas:

(1) Tanker aircraft will not be scheduled to enter the area at designated entry points at intervals less than one hour. To provide a degree of flexibility for unforeseen conditions, a pair of tankers may be entered prior to the scheduled operational time of the first aircraft.

NOTE: For special missions directed by the parent numbered air force, the time interval may be reduced.

(2) If the tanker aircraft is orbiting at the air refueling control point and the receiver aircraft is within plus or minus 10 minutes of the scheduled refueling time, the tanker aircraft will either depart the refueling track or orbit the designated exit point and exit the area, avoiding the rendezvous areas. It is imperative that timing be maintained within this limit or a conflict with subsequent refueling formations.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

c. Special Procedures for Dual Track Areas:

(1) Since reciprocal refueling tracks are established within dual track areas, aircraft may be scheduled to complete refueling on own tracks, cross over to the other track prior to exiting the area, and continue refueling in the opposite direction. If this concept is utilized, aircraft will hold at the exit and off the first refueling track, within the published area, and depart the holding area to make good the next scheduled area entry time and the ARCOP for opposite direction refueling.

(2) Both tracks in a dual track refueling area may be utilized for refueling in the same or opposite direction (parallel refueling operations) provided all aircraft concerned are briefed on the cross-over procedure to be used and the communications being conducted on the adjacent track. Simultaneous use of both tracks is not authorized.

(3) While crossing over to the opposite track, the communications will be switched to the appropriate communications-rendezvous plan as defined in Annex I, SACM 100-24. For the opposite track.

(4) Altitude reservation missions are not limited to area entry times and ARCOP departure by a minimum of 20 minutes.

4. Priority. The peacetime FAA-JCS Air Traffic Control priorities as defined in SACM 55-3 do not apply to activity in high altitude refueling areas. During periods of operation, the high altitude refueling area controlling agency will have the same status as an air traffic control agency. Permissive reservation procedures will be used for IFR or altitude reservation flights. Airplanes must be obtained prior to takeoff from the Refueling Facility (CARF) with the area specified altitude within the area. Control altitude will allow a conflicting altitude reservation to operate. Higher headquarters wave the authority to grant waivers to certain aircraft. Numbered air forces may clear the aircraft controlled by agencies under their command just outside the area. Headquarters SAC charged with planning missions must take cognizance of these refueling areas.

5. MARSA. The military assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft within the high altitude refueling area (except for radar monitored flight), but will make no attempt to provide separation between and above a unit's altitude. Consequently, permission from FAA to extend refueling operations over that area will be obtained daily. The daily block schedule within the daily block close to ground rules provided in this manual will ensure the safe conduct of the air refueling operations. MARSA be referenced in the Remarks section of the SAG Form 121 or AF Form 175, as appropriate, for each tanker and receiver.

Dear Allen,

I have good news on the 25 Oct 53 sighting of ---- and ---- gathering area. Nichols operations were conducted in the "High Life" refueling area. There is some discrepancy in the time reported. However, since the prior report indicated that the observation was 10 minutes before sunset I felt that this was a better guide than the stated time.

I am enclosing an extract of Sunset and Twilight times from the Ephemeris. With the reported altitude of ---- and ---- you can no doubt figure this closer than we can. I have also attached portions of SAC Manual 55-14 which gives the "Twilight Procedures" for high altitudes and that portion pertaining to "High Life". CMC-306 and 307 cover this area as well as all accepted locations mentioned in their report. Also enclosed is a copy of the FAA report and ---- letter. The answer data from Nashville, North Carolina has been ordered and will be forwarded upon arrival.

I thought this might be a good case on which to write a case summary, not necessarily for general release but for our files. Would it be possible for you to do this since the figures concerned with sunset, twilight, air refueling aircraft, altitude of the air refueling operations aircraft, etc., are quite involved. I am sure that your figures would be much more exact than mine.

Therefore, I would appreciate it if you would write up some sort of a summary which includes the geometry of the situation causing that a "phenomenon of the refueling aircraft" was the cause of the sighting.

We have completed duplicating the cases from the first 11 months of 1963 and should have this portion of the project completed by next weekend. Miscellaneous information including maps of the refueling areas, for the committee, have been forwarded in a separate envelope.

Have Fun!

SACM 55-14

6. Right-of-Way. Civil Air Regulations, Part 60, paragraph 60.14(b), was amended on 15 Feb 60 to give refueling aircraft the same right of way as aircraft being towed.

7. Tactical Doctrine. The SAC Tactical Doctrine will be complied with to the maximum extent. Deviations are authorized when it is necessary to comply with the USAF-FAA agreements reflected in this manual.

8. Flight Levels. Flight levels indicated as operational altitudes are inclusive. Special care must be exercised when using flight level 240, as it is not authorized as an operational level. The take-off crew will be required to secure the best available altimeter setting for the refueling area and assure that refueling operations are not conducted below 24,000 feet MSL.

9. Altitude Clearance. Operations other than refueling will avoid active refueling areas by at least 1,000 feet above or below the published altitude, except for flight levels 290, which equals 2,000 feet altitude separation.

10. RBS Activity. Aircraft engaged in RBS activity VFR or VFR-on-top adjacent to a high altitude refueling area at altitudes which conflict with the refueling operation will avoid the refueling area by at least 15 nautical miles during the period of time the refueling area is active.

11. Manual Changes. The procedures contained in this chapter are directive in nature. The refueling area have been implemented by a formal agreement between USAF and the FAA. Changes to the refueling area will appear in the Airman's Guide with subsequent changes to this manual. INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE AIRMAN'S GUIDE TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER THIS MANUAL. Simultaneous publication of a formal change to this manual with the effective date of the change in the Airman's Guide is not possible. The briefing officer will be responsible for briefing the changes to the refueling areas as they become effective.

a. Alfa. Numbered air forces will coordinate directly with FAA Region and/or FAA ARTC Center personnel for changes desired to existing areas or to initiate action on establishing a new area. The FAA Liaison Officer at the numbered air force headquarters may be requested to assist in this coordination.

b. Bravo. After approval, the Region will forward the approved coordinates and flight levels to the FAA-SAC Liaison Officer at HQ (DODF2).

c. Charlie. The new area or the changes to a revised area will be effective 12 days after the date of the publishing date of the Airman's Guide in which it first appears.

12. Communications. Communications-rendezvous plus contained in this manual refer to Annex 5, SACM 100-24. The following procedures are prescribed for use during refueling operations:

All refueling aircraft approaching refueling areas shall establish communication with the appropriate ATC Center on the center "area SECRET" UHF frequency. All tanker and receiver aircraft will report over the entrance and exit points.

a. Receiver aircraft commands will:

(1) Prior to rendezvous with tanker aircraft, advise Air Traffic Control that the ATC frequency will not be guarded for a specified period while conducting the refueling mission. Further contacts should be addressed through the tanker aircraft involved in the refueling operation.

4

SACM 56-14

(2) Upon establishing contact with the tanker aircraft, give the pertinent portion of the current flight plan when applicable. In the event that tanker and receiver aircraft attended a common briefing prior to flight, and the current flight plan has been received, a detailed flight plan need not be given. However, all changes in either will be relayed in order to insure that the tanker pilot is familiar with the current clearances.

(3) Receive positive position reports from tanker aircraft upon completion of the refueling operation. This will include any changes to the ATC clearance which may have been obtained.

(4) Insure that aircraft proceed in accordance with the ATC clearance or, in the event a change is required, obtain the necessary amendments.

(5) Immediately after breakoff from the tanker, establish communications with the appropriate ATC for one of the following services:

(a) If on an IFR flight plan after completion of the air refueling, ANC or radar separation can be continued between the receiver aircraft and other aircraft on IFR high plans.

(b) If on an IFR flight plan, in VFR conditions on top, the receiver can be issued appropriate traffic advisories.

(c) If operating VFR, appropriate traffic advisories can be issued to the receiver prior to departing the immediate vicinity of the completed refueling operation. In the event that no pertinent traffic exists, the receiver will so be advised and clearance will be issued the center frequency.

b. Tanker aircraft commanders will:

(1) Insure that they have obtained the current ATC clearance under which the receiver aircraft is operating. In the event the course of the refueling mission deviates from the provisions of this clearance, tanker aircraft commanders will insure that necessary amendments are obtained from ATC for both tanker and receiver aircraft. They will supply:

(a) The flight levels to be used in refueling.
(b) Estimated time in refueling area.
(c) If other than a single direction track through the entire length of refueling area, sufficient description of the route within the area to provide the controller with information necessary to effect separation with other aircraft.

(2) When rendezvous has been completed and visual contact established, be responsible for completing all position reports for both tanker and receiver aircraft.

(3) During refueling operations, designate a crew member to:

(a) Maintain a continuous listening watch on appropriate ATC frequency.
(b) Complete radio calls required for both aircraft.

5


- page 14 -

SACM 55-14

(4) Furnish the receiver aircraft commander a positive position at the completion of re-
fueling operations together with any amendments or changes to the ATC clearance, if such have
been obtained.

c. All procedures outlined in paragraphs 12a and b, above, apply to the tanker tank force
commander during mass air refuelings whenever aircraft of either the tanker or receiver force is
operating under ATC clearance.

13. Numbering. High altitude refueling areas will be numbered consecutively as coordinated and
implemented.

14. Grid Navigation. Whenever key ARCPs are located 60° North Latitude or above, grid naviga-
tion will be used and all references to headings between aircraft will be in grid.

SUNSET AND TWILIGHT, 1963
LOCAL MEAN TIME OF SUNSET AND END OF ASTRONOMICAL TWILIGHT - MERIDIAN OF GREENWICH

The page contains two large tables showing sunset times and end of astronomical twilight times for different latitudes and dates from October to December 1963. The tables are divided into two sections:

1. SUNSET (UPPER LIMB)
2. END OF ASTRONOMICAL TWILIGHT

At the bottom of the page, there is a section for SOUTHERN LATITUDES (April to July) with additional notes about how to use the tables.

The page is numbered 389 in the top right corner.

A note at the bottom of the page reads: "For dates on first line, enter tables above with dates on second line, and apply the correction (in minutes) given on the third line."

The text is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The only clearly visible text is "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The page appears to be a technical chart or graph with numerous grid lines and small text boxes, but the specific details cannot be discerned from this image.


- page 24 -

I apologize, but I cannot discern any readable text on this page. The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with a complex pattern of intersecting lines, but the text, if any exists, is too faint or blurry to read clearly. The document looks like it might be a technical chart or data visualization, but I cannot make out any specific details or text.


- page 25 -

The image appears to be a complex technical document with a large grid or chart taking up most of the page. On the right side of the page, there are several text boxes with what seems to be detailed information. However, due to the low contrast and image quality, most of the text is illegible. The only clearly visible text is "DIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text is too blurry to accurately transcribe.


- page 26 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with very faint markings. Most of the text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The page has hole punches on the left side, indicating it was likely part of a bound document. The grid lines are clearly visible, creating a uniform pattern across the entire page, but no specific text or detailed information can be discerned from this image.


- page 27 -

The image appears to be a complex grid or chart, with most text being too small or blurry to read clearly. The only legible text I can make out is "DIABETIC CHART" in the upper right portion of the document. The rest of the document consists of a dense grid of small boxes and lines, typical of a medical or data recording chart.


- page 28 -

I apologize, but the text in this image is too faint and illegible for me to perform accurate OCR. The document appears to be a grid or chart-like page with vertical and diagonal lines, but the text within the grid is not clear enough to read.


- page 29 -

The image appears to be an "ADIABATIC CHART" document with a complex grid-like structure. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The chart seems to be a technical document with numerous rows and columns of data, but the specific details are not legible in this scanned image.


- page 30 -

The image appears to be a graph paper or grid sheet with very faint markings. No legible text is visible on this page. The document looks like a technical or scientific chart with numerous grid lines forming small rectangular sections. There are two hole punches on the left side of the page, suggesting it was part of a bound document or file. The image is in black and white and appears to be an old, slightly degraded document.


- page 31 -

The image appears to be a complex document with a large grid or chart on the left side and several text boxes on the right side. The text is mostly illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. The only clearly readable text is "AEROLOGIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text is too blurry to accurately transcribe.


- page 32 -

The image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The grid lines are clearly visible, creating a uniform pattern of squares across the entire page. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some edge darkening and two hole punches visible on the left side of the page. No legible text is visible on this page.

- page 34 -

The image appears to be a detailed data chart or log with multiple grid sections. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. On the right side of the document, there is a section labeled "ANALYTICAL CHART" but the specific details within the chart are not legible. The left side of the document contains a vertical grid with numerical markings, possibly representing some form of measurement or scale. The overall document seems to be a technical or scientific record with dense tabular information.


- page 35 -

The image appears to be a grid or chart with vertical and horizontal lines. Most of the text is too illegible to read clearly. There are some faint markings and lines crossing through the grid, but the specific details are not discernible due to the poor image quality and low contrast. The document has hole punches on the left side, suggesting it is from a binder or file. The overall background is a grayscale white to black gradient.


- page 36 -

The primary text I can clearly see on this document is "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the page. The rest of the document appears to be a complex grid or chart with numerous small text entries, but most of the text is too small or blurry to reliably transcribe. The document looks like a technical or scientific reference chart with multiple sections and grid lines.


- page 37 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with very faint markings. Most of the text is illegible due to the low contrast and image quality. There are some numbers visible on the left side of the page, but they are too blurry to read with certainty. The page has hole punches on the left side, suggesting it is from a bound document or file. No clear text can be definitively transcribed from this image.


- page 38 -

The image appears to be a complex document with multiple sections, including a large grid-like area on the left side and several text boxes on the right side. However, due to the low contrast and image quality, most of the text is illegible. The only clearly readable text I can see is "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text is too blurry or faint to accurately transcribe.


- page 39 -

The image appears to be a graph or chart with a grid pattern. The grid lines are clearly visible, creating a network of horizontal and vertical lines. On the left side of the image, there are some numerical markings, with numbers visible such as 10, 8, 7, and 3. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document with some slight discoloration and aging effects around the edges. The graph seems to have some faint lines or markings within the grid, but the details are not very clear due to the image quality.


- page 40 -

The image appears to be an "ADIABATIC CHART" with numerous rows and columns of numerical data and grid lines. Most of the text is too small or blurry to read clearly. The chart covers most of the page and seems to be a technical or scientific document with complex tabular information. The image is in black and white and appears to be an old document or technical reference sheet.


- page 41 -

I apologize, but the image appears to be a very faint grid or chart with extremely low contrast and legibility. While there are vertical and horizontal lines forming a grid-like pattern, I cannot confidently read any text or discern specific details from this document. The image looks like a scanned page that is very dark and washed out, making OCR extraction impossible.


- page 42 -

The text is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scanned document. The only clearly visible text is "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text appears to be in a grid or tabular format, but the individual characters are too blurry to read accurately.


- page 43 -

The image appears to be a grid or graph paper with vertical and horizontal lines forming a grid pattern. The image is in black and white and appears to be a scanned document. There are two oval-shaped holes on the left side of the page, suggesting it was part of a bound document or file. No legible text is visible on this page.

The document is in black and white and looks like an official form or administrative record with numerous rows and columns. On the right side of the document, there are some text boxes and sections, but the specific details are not legible. The document seems to be densely filled with data or information, but the resolution and quality make it difficult to discern specific text.

GENTLEMEN:

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN A MOST UNUSUAL SIGHTING THAT OCCURRED IN YOUR AREA DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 25, 1963, DURING THE COURSE OF A VFR FLIGHT PLAN FILED BY BONANZA NORTHWEST ST. LOUIS AND MITCHELL.

THE AIRCRAFT WAS CRUISING AT A TRUE AIRSPEED OF 170 MPH AT AN ALTITUDE OF 6500 FEET ON A HEADING OF 310 MAGNETIC. THE SKY CONDITION WAS CLEAR WITH WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST AT APPROXIMATELY 15 KNOTS. AT APPROXIMATELY 18:45, WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNUSUAL CLOUD WAS SIGHTED BEARING SOUTH. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHERE NORTH OF THE TYNDALL INTERSECTION.

IT FIRST WAS NOTICED AS A DARK, SHARPLY DEFINED MASS, WHICH APPEARED TO BE SLIGHTLY ABOVE OUR ALTITUDE. AT FIRST STUDY IT WAS JUDGED TO BE A LARGE TANKER MAKING DROGUE CONTACT, SINCE THERE WAS A SMALL OBJECT BEHIND IT. IT APPEARED TO BE PARALLELING OUR COURSE. IT THEN BEGAN TO GROW LARGER. ALTHOUGH THE OUTLINE WAS EXTREMELY SHARP AND CONCISE, IT DID NOT HAVE AN IDENTIFIABLE AIRCRAFT SHAPE.

WE TURNED TOWARDS THE OBJECT. A LACK OF RELATIVE MOVEMENT INDICATED IT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT, PROBABLY A CLOUD. HOWEVER, THE SMALL ADJACENT SPECK BEGAN TO GROW LARGER AND THE MAIN OBJECT BEGAN TO SHRINK IN SIZE AND THE WHOLE MASS APPEARED TO RECEDE. AT THIS POINT WE TURNED BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL COURSE TOWARDS MITCHELL. AT THAT TIME THE SINGLE REMAINING MASS DISINTEGRATED INTO APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 20 SMALL OBJECTS AND THE WHOLE GROUP DISAPPEARED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE PRONOUNCED DOT, WHICH LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE AN AIRCRAFT FROM THE REAR. THIS DOT BECAME PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR WATCH.

I apologize, but I cannot discern any readable text on this page. The image appears to be a grid or chart with lines and markings, but the text is too faint or blurry to be legible through OCR. The document looks like a black and white scanned page with a grid-like pattern, possibly a map, chart, or data sheet, but the details are not clear enough to transcribe.

The primary text I can clearly read on this page is "ADIABATIC CHART" at the top right of the document. The rest of the text appears to be very small and illegible due to the low resolution and grayscale nature of the scanned document. The page appears to be a technical chart or graph with numerous rows and columns, but the specific details are not discernible.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SHAPE WAS RETURNING AND WE IMMEDIATELY TURNED TOWARDS IT ON A HEADING OF 150. AT THIS TIME THE SUN WAS OVER THE HORIZON BUT THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE LIGHT IN THE SKY AND THE OBJECT WAS CLEARLY BACK-LIGHTED AND THUS SHARPLY ETCHED AGAINST THE SKY.

AT THAT TIME THE RANGE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSUME. THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE A 70*NIGHT APPEAR IN A DISTANCE OF TWO MILES, HEAD ON, AT THAT DISTANCE THE INCREASE IN SIZE STOPPED. A SMALL DOT APPEARED TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE MASS. THE DOT BEGAN TO GROW IN SIZE AND THE MAIN MASS BEGAN TO SHRINK. FINALLY THE TWO OBJECTS HAD COMPLETELY CHANGED POSITIONS, THE DOT WAS AS LARGE AS THE ORIGINAL MASS AND THE ORIGINAL MASS WAS GONE. WE CONTINUED ON THIS HEADING TOWARDS THE OBJECT UNTIL 1915. SINCE THE RANGE THEN APPEARED TO BE OPENING AND IT WAS PAST BECOMING DARK, WE DISCONTINUED THE CHASE AND RETURNED TO MITCHELL, LANDING AT APPROXIMATELY 1940.

MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A RESERVE MILITARY JET PILOT AND THAT OF THE PILOT LEFT US WITH NO CONCLUSIONS. IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY WAS NO AIRCRAFT, SINCE AIRCRAFT DO NOT CHANGE SHAPE AND SIZE. FURTHER, THE RELATIVE MOVEMENT DID NOT FIT AN AIRCRAFT COURSE. ALTHOUGH IT RESEMBLED A CLOUD OF SMOKE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ALTITUDE GUNNERY, THE RAPID CHANGE OF SIZE, DISAPPEARANCE AND REAPPEARANCE AND OUR INABILITY TO CLOSE THE RANGE CONSISTENTLY WOULD SEEM TO RULE OUT ANY CONDENSATION. AN EXTREMELY DENSE FLIGHT OF BIRDS COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE UNUSUAL MOVEMENTS OF THE SHAPES, BUT AT OUR SPEED WE WOULD HAVE CLOSED ON SUCH A FLOCK.

AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION, WE WERE FORCED TO CONCEDE THAT IT WAS SIMPLY AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER INFORMATION WE CAN ADD, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME AT THE ABOVE ADDRESS OR MR. [REDACTED], SPARTA, ILLINOIS.

RESPECTFULLY,

-24-

minutes ago, when it was realized the object was not properly identified as a weather, or was called to the attention of the other group, etc. The 20-30 old personnel in a local hospital, at this time, the group was 18-20 per cent sure it was a balloon, or a weather, or the like. The group seemed to be "wound up" and the air was full of excitement, with people running to and fro, and the situation was getting more tense. The object was moving throughout the entire observation and, at no time, did it have the exact appearance of any flying machine known to us. Its silhouette, however, was very definite, sharp, and left no doubt as to whether or not it was a cloud formation. In detail, it was not a cloud.

As the group settled to calm, or as the object proceeded to go, it appeared at the point to have the shape of a small, round-ish, somewhat, cigar or a half mile away.

At this point, it was decided to turn toward and clearly the situation. Gradually after turning toward, the group appeared to increase in size and the main body diminished in size until the group became as large as the original object.

A note or so later, the object was so high up, or perhaps it was, that it was lost to view. The object was stationary, or perhaps drifting very slowly. The object was seen moving westward to the vicinity, or to the air base at Sioux City, and it was clear until the sky is mentioned to the involved.
