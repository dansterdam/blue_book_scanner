This will reply to your recent correspondence regarding your October 1, 1966 observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

We regret that you were unable to return your forms earlier. For now we are unable to undertake a comprehensive investigation due to the lapse of time. Air activity records are normally destroyed after thirty days; therefore, it would be impossible to check the records on the date of your observation.

Although we are unable to identify positively the stimulus, your information will be added to the present data base. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I am writing you a letter to you that my friend and I saw a UFO. We have been hesitating to write to you for fear we will be ridiculed because I am ridiculed all day by my classmates. They think I am crazy believing in UFOs. I have read four flying saucer paperbacks. They are as follows: Anatomy of Phenomenon, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Flying Saucers, The Starting Evidence of the Invasion from Outer Space, and Flying Saucers Serious B

I think that The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects was the most interesting. I believe in UFO almost entirely. I hope they will find the answer in this decade, and I hope the answer is that there are space crafts from other world beside our own.

Gentlemen:

I am very sorry that I haven't sent you this form sooner but I couldn't find it after I filled it out. Would you please send me the results. I would like to know what opinion on what you think it is. I surely don't know.

Do you have any information on UFOs that I might have? Also would you be so kind as to send me some information on becoming a member of your great organization, Project Blue Book. I have read many magazines, pamphlets, and books on UFOs. If you have any information on these items please send them to me because I am greatly interested in this subject. I have studied them for 10 years and I thought I would never see one myself.
