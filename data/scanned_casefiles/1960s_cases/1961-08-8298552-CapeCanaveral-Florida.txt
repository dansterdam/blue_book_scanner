A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ELIMINATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF WEATHER BALLOONS, TEST AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS
AND OTHER PHENOMENA WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS SIGHTING. ALL
RESULTS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE. THE ONLY POSSIBILITY WHICH HAS NOT
BEEN ELIMINATED IS THAT OF THE OBJECT BEING A METEORITE. IN VIEW

OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF METEORITE ACTIVITY THE NIGHT OF THE SIGHTING
THIS POSSIBILITY CAN NOT BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED, HOWEVER,
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT, THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO TAIL OR
DID NOT APPEAR TO BURNING AND THE OBSERVER'S ESTIMATE THAT THE
OBJECT WAS AT A 1500 FOOT ALTITUDE AND NO MORE THAN 2 TO 3 MILES
FROM HIM MAKES THIS ANALYSIS UNLIKELY. L. NONE.
