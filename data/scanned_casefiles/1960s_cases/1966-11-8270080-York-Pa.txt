November 13,1963.

To Whom It May Concern:

I would like to report an Unidentified Flying Object.
Before I begin though, I must tell you that I have sent an
exact copy to: A.F.R.O.

On November 11,1966,I was on my way home. As I stood
outside the door I saw something in the sky.
It looked like a very shiny metal cone with short wings.
As I watched, it disappeared behind a row of houses on our
street. By the time I had run out back it was gone.

The next day, between 4:15 and 4:30 I again saw the thing
almost in the same position as before. This time I did a bit
of research.

When I saw the thing I was standing approximately 90 feet
from a telephone pole which was feet high from ground level.
Directly above the pole was the thing. It moved in an easterly
direction and seemed to be about a mile away in the sky. To
me it seemed to be about an inch long.

Would you please give me some information concerning the
object.

Yours truly,

[Signature redacted]
