I WAS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF OUR HOUSE HUNTING NIGHT CRAWLERS WITH MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND.

I WAS WATCHING THE GROUND WHEN EXAMINED, "THERE'S A SATELLITE," AND POINTED TO THE OBJECT IN THE SKY, WHEN WE LOOKED UP, WE IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED THE FAST-MOVING OBJECT. I SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT "THAT'S NOT A SATELLITE, IT'S TOO LOW, AND IT'S MOVING TOO FAST." I SAID, "I STILL THINK IT'S A SATELLITE. I SAID, "NO, SATELLITES DON'T COME THAT LOW NOR MOVE SO FAST. MAYBE IT'S A FLYING SAUCER." (A MEMBER OF OUR CLASS GAVE A REPORT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ON THE SUBJECT OF UFOS, AND I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT SINCE.) AT THE TIME I SAW IT, I DIDN'T CONSIDER IT PROBABLE THAT THE OBJECT WAS A FLYING SAUCER.) AS THE OBJECT DIPPED, I NOTICED THE COLOR, SIZE, AND SHAPE OF THE OBJECT, AND THAT IT WAS SPINNING. WE WERE WATCHING IT WHEN IT SPEEDED UP AND VANISHED BEHIND A CLOUD. AFTER WE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING AN AIRCRAFT, BUT SAME WAS NOT, BECAUSE IT WAS TRAVELING TOO FAST FOR THAT HEIGHT, AND BECAUSE IT WAS SPINNING.

THE NEXT DAY I TOLD A CLASSMATE OF MINE ABOUT IT, AND HE ORDERED THIS REPORT FORM FOR ME. IN MY OPINION, THE OBJECT WAS AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VEHICLE.
