34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 21 MAY 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting: 

IT WAS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF OUR HOUSE ON THE EVENING OF MAY 2, 1965. MY BROTHER *** AND MY GIRLFRIEND, *** WERE WATCHING THE GROUND WHEN THEY EXCITED ME TO GO OUTSIDE AND LOOK UP, WHICH WE DID. WE WATCHED THE OBJECT IN THE SKY. WHEN WE LOOKED TO THE OBJECT, IT SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS NOT A SATELLITE, NOR AN AIRCRAFT, AND STAYING VERY STILL. - SAID, "I STILL THINK IT'S A SATELLITE OR SOME KIND OF GAME WE'RE WATCHING." IT STAYED THERE A WHILE AND THEN TOOK OFF IN A HURRY. MAYBE IT'S A FLYING SAUCER. (A MEMBER OF OUR CLASS GAVE A REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS A FEW MONTHS AGO ON THE SUBJECT OF UFOS, AND I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT SINCE. ) I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLYING OBJECT SINCE IT MOVED RAPIDLY AND HOVERED WITHOUT APPARENT MOTION. AND SINCE IT WAS SPINNING, WE WERE WATCHING IT WHEN IT SPED UP AND DISAPPEARED THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING AN AIRCRAFT, SINCE IT TRAVELS TOO FAST FOR THAT HEIGHT, AND BECAUSE IT WAS SPINNING.
