11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object had multi-color lights on it.
The object was seen in the NE and was moving up and down.

Comments: The observer is only 9 yrs of age. His mother
wrote that, "I think that this is something he himself want-
ed to see and although he believes that it is true, I do
not." Since it is felt that the report is the result of the
active imagination of a child. The report is being carried as
an "Unreliable report because of Age."

[Top Instruction Text]
NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

[Middle Text]
IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The document contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches of a landscape scene with directional markings.
