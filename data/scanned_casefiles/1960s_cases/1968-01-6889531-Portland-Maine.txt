1. DATE/TIME GROUP: 1-5-68 16005
2. LOCATION: Portland, Maine 
3. SOURCE: ---
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-10 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: Civilian
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: OTHER: UNRELIABLE REPORT
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer sighted an object that had multi-color lights on it. The object was moving in the NE and was moving up and down. Comments: The observer is only 9 yrs of age. His mother wrote that, "I think that this is something he himself wanted to see and although he believes that it is true, I do not." Since it is felt that the report is unreliable, the report is being carried as an "Unreliable report because of age."

Transcribing the text from the image:

Dear Sir,
I have seen an object light up at about 7:30 p.m. the object moving saying about 5 to 10 minutes, it was on about the size of a basketball, going faster than an airplane, about the size of a small object idling near the ground. It was moving to the north slowly, about 150 to 300 feet. It was making a noise like a motor running. It was incredible to me. At first it looked like a star or something, but it was moving at a slow speed. About 150 to 300 feet up. It was real.

The North East region is made up of States like New York, Albany, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, each of which are described as having "big ocean-going ships" and that "The largest city of this region is Portland, Boston, New York, Jersey City". The document then states that "This is a good manufacturing region because a skilled workers, machinery, transport, Customers" and mentions the Hudson River and "The Erie Canal - The Erie Canat [sic], The Hudson Canals of the materials shipment of northeastern, and well roads Inland".

CASE FILE NO. 10-FEBRUARY 10, 1958 
REPORT: 

OBJECT OBSERVED: 
TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS SIGHTED IN PORTLAND, MAINE AREA 

OBSERVER: 
MR. JOHN DOE 

SUMMARY:
ON FEBRUARY 10, 1958 AT APPROXIMATELY 8:07 P.M. MR. JOHN DOE WAS DRIVING ON THE THRUWAY NEAR PORTLAND, MAINE WHEN HE OBSERVED TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS IN THE SKY. THE OBJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 10-15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WERE MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE ROUND OR DISC-SHAPED AND WERE EMITTING A BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT. THEY WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.

CONCLUSION:
THE OBJECTS OBSERVED BY MR. JOHN DOE WERE MOST LIKELY AIRCRAFT OR SATELLITES. WHILE THE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED DOES MATCH SOME PREVIOUS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS, WITHOUT FURTHER EVIDENCE OR CORROBORATING WITNESSES, A DEFINITIVE IDENTIFICATION COULD NOT BE MADE. THE CASE IS LISTED AS "UNRESOLVED" IN PROJECT BLUE BOOK FILES.
