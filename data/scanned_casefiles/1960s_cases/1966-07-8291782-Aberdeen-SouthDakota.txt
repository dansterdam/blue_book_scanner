SUBJECT: UFO Sighting Report, 20 July 1966

TO: APSC (STD)

Reference Telecon between Lt Marley, your organization and myself, regarding UFO sighting at Aberdeen, S.Dak, on 10 July. Due to the present Airman manning (25% of authorized strength), this branch is unable to fully support even our primary wartime mission. Providing the assistance you request would degrade our unit's war comments, and for this reason we are unable to comply.

ROBERT M CLARK, Capt, USAF
Chief, Combat Intelligence Branch
