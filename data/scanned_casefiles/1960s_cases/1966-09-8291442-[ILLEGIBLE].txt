35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

About 7:20 - September 5, 1965 a friend and I were on Gus Road, sitting in the car, when we noticed what appeared to be a bright light in the sky. This light appeared to be larger than a star and was moving rapidly across the sky in a northeasterly direction. The light appeared to have a tail or some type of exhaust and was emitting a very bright light. It was not blinking like an aircraft and was moving much too fast to be a plane. After a few seconds, it disappeared from view. Later that evening at about 10:00 the exact same type object was sighted by my roommate and neighbor in the same area. This object was also moving rapidly and emitting a bright light. It was observed for only a few seconds and then disappeared.

This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a series of illustrations and diagrams related to the study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as part of Project Blue Book. The illustrations include a compass rose, a sketch of the motion of an object or objects, and a diagram showing the direction of multiple objects.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you first saw it. Place a "C" on the same curved line to show where "A" was on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Reference your unidentified observation of 1 September 1966. The information which we have could not be sufficiently developed for evaluation. Request you complete the information on the enclosed form and return the envelope provided.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF

Dear Major Quintanilla:

This is a request to have the member of witnesses reinterviewed to get more details on any unexplained phenomena, their explanations and personal opinions of the incident. Apparently this incident was not taken seriously enough by others.

Let me reiterate that this case from September 1966 is still being investigated. Considering the surface details, including testimony suggesting the object did not conform with any known aircraft or meteor, and that the witnesses could establish its relative size and other details, we feel it is necessary to pursue this lead and elicit more data concerning the event.

I would request that you assist in this, as I feel it warrants more thorough documentation and review. Please advise if you can proceed with this additional investigation, as I believe it will shed more light on this potentially significant case.

Thank you for your consideration.

"Just something he's going over in the air. I told the man I could not in good conscience attempt to analyze this report as presented. It was very vague about 1st 50 seconds but have since received more details that indicate the object was quite large and hovered and then shot away at a rapid rate. Probably the closest to what the witnesses described. The sighting was miles away and was apparently quite difficult to determine distances by the witness. He seemed puzzled and said it was real difficult to judge how far away and how large it was as well as the speed. He was sufficiently impressed that he thought it was not a conventional aircraft. The case crew remain to be convinced."

COMMANDER
Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC)
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dear Sir:

The purpose of this communication is to informally confirm an alleged sighting of a fly object. Actually, however, upon checking, there is no record of this incident according to local radio broadcasts. Many other activities in this area around the same time do not give it much thought.

Based on the nature of what was observed, and the fact that it does not seem to conform to any known aircraft formation, I am inclined to believe this was a "valid" sighting, and I actually have never observed such before.

I am located in the small town of Talmage, California (CROP # 670) which is about 5 miles east of Ukiah, California. It was the time of twilight, a clear evening, and I was looking into the southern sky. I suddenly observed an object, about the size of a medium aircraft (approx. 60 ft. in diameter), moving at a fairly high rate of speed...

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

We started the object watching a jet airplane. The plane came from the NNE and made a gradual turn to the west. While the object was watching the airplane, the object began closing in on the airplane. The closer the object came to the airplane, the closer it was turning to the west. There is no way to tell that the object was with the airplane. If it was close to the airplane, it was traveling at the same speed. Another witness said that the object seemed to disappear. The winds were out of the east at the time. The winds that were blowing at the time were out of the west, and they would indicate that the object was blowing in the wind, however, it could not think of anything which would account for the object crossing an arc of 45 degrees in not more than 2 seconds. The object may have been an illusion to the observers, and it was figured that if it was blowing in the wind, it was about 16 inches in diameter and shaped like a cigar. The witness could not remember exactly the apparent size and singular speed of the object.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

I have checked our files and have found only one sighting which occurred 7 September 1966. This sighting occurred in Dalton, Kentucky as approximately 1900 CST and was not however, observed by any air crew as far as we know. After the information has been submitted on your sighting, on the enclosed FTD Form 164, our analysts will study and try to determine the stimuli.

Dear Sir:

I would like to inform Project Blue Book concerning the sighting of an unusual object. On the date mentioned, this object appeared to be in the vicinity of a jet aircraft, however, I am certain this object was not a part of the aircraft. 

I am planning to write a research paper concerning this sighting for an astronomy course. I would like to obtain any information possibly related to this sighting. If you have any photographs or other data concerning this event, I would greatly appreciate the use. Please send me the names and addresses of any such observers so that I might contact them for additional information. This is very important, and I would certainly appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

I would also please appreciate if you could send me a copy of the Air Force booklet, "A DE identification of Flying Objects" and a copy of the most recent Department of Air Force research concerning U.F.O.s.

Thank You Very Much,

Date you completed this questionnaire: 1 Sept 66 year

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared at roughly 10:15 pm on Aug 6, 1966. It was first visible as a plane with vapor trails going east to west. But it slowed to a stop, hovered, then took off at a high rate of speed to the north, disappearing in a matter of seconds. It seemed to be luminous, and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It made no sound. We watched it for several minutes as it did these maneuvers. I would appreciate an analysis of my report. Respectfully.

OCR Output:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 Sept 66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The tail that remained constant began with a point and expanded into a more rounded shape as it traveled with the main portion. It seemed to be trailing vapor streams. As the main portion of the light slowed and came to a stop, the tail continued to travel away for quite some time. The light then appeared to suddenly collapse in on itself and disappear. I thought we must be dealing with some type of aircraft or craft. The movement and behavior of the light was very unusual and unlike anything I have ever seen before. My wife called my attention to the sight and we both observed it intently for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared. It seemed to be traveling at a very rapid rate of speed and then just stopped moving and collapsed. I would appreciate any information you can provide concerning this sighting.
