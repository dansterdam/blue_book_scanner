Dear Major Quintanilla,

Due to the number of sightings enclosed in my sightings, I will tell you about them step by step.

At approximately 8:00 pm on Tues. - Sept 6, 1966, after finishing the supper dishes and putting my youngest child to bed, I went out on the back porch and sat. I was out there only a few minutes, when I saw a light appear and disappear. I watched it for several minutes then called my husband to come out. I tried to point it out to.

The text appears to be handwritten and somewhat difficult to read. While I can see the writing, the cursive script and image quality make it challenging to confidently transcribe the entire text.

objects were in view about
15-20 seconds, but have

Dear Sir:

The purpose of this communication is to informally confirm an alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object. Actually, I didn't realize that I was watching a "UFO" yesterday evening, however, according to local radio broadcasts, many other citizens in this area watched the same object. At the time, I didn't give it much thought, because I imagined it to be a man-made satellite. I am not quite sure as to the validity of "UFO" sightings and I actually have never sighted one before now...

I am located in the small town of Talmage, California (POP: 578) which is situated two miles east of Ukiah, California. At the time of this sighting, I was facing south and was looking into the southern sky. Visibility was unlimited and the time was approximately 2150 PDT (4 Sept. 66). The object was at such a great altitude that I am unable to give you an estimate, however, it was fairly bright and made a 10,000 ft. elevation in the southern sky, heading in a SSE direction on a fairly erratic course. The sighting (mine) lasted for approximately 15 minutes (until 0215 - 5 Sept. 66), at which time it ceased out of sight. It seemed to be traveling at a constant speed. I could not make out the shape of this object at all because of its great distance.

I regret that this is all of the information that I am able to give you regarding the above...

Sincerely,

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The object looked almost exactly like the glow in the center of a low wattage, frosted light bulb.


- page 46 -

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
It followed a straight course, and maintained a constant speed.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   14     Feb.     1967
                                                   Day     Month     Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

We first noticed the object while watching a jet airplane. The plane came from the NNE and made a gradual turn to the west. While the plane was on a more westerly course we noticed the object about 20 degrees above the plane. The plane seemed to pull in closer to the object while making its turn to the west.

The object seemed to be far away. Actually there is no way to tell how far away it was, and it could have been fairly close. If it was close to the airplane, it was traveling at the same speed. As the plane and object came closer to the horizon, the object was about 1/2 degree to the south and above the plane. According to the Weather Bureau in Flint, the winds were out of the east at about 6 mph at the time of the sighting. Since the object flew an a straight course to the west, it is possible that it was blowing in the wind. However, I could not think of anything which would have fit the object's description and been a possibility considering the weather conditions.

The object crossed an arc of 45 degrees in not more than 30 seconds. Using this information along with the speed of the wind, I compared street lamps to the apparent size of the object. I figured that it was blowing in the wind, it was about 16 inches in diameter. Of course this is not an extremely accurate measurement since I cannot remember exactly the apparent size and angular speed of the object.

Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED] 29 November 1966

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]

I have checked our files and have found only one sighting which occurred 7 September 1966. This sighting occurred in Dalton, Kentucky at approximately 1800 CST and was not, however, observed by any air crew as far as we know. After the information has been submitted on your sighting, on the enclosed FTD Form 164, our analysts will study and try to determine the stimuli.

Project Blue Book Information Office

Washington D.C. 20330

Dear Sirs,

I would like to inform Project Blue Book concerning the sighting of an unusual flying object by a friend of mine, and myself on the evening of September 7, 1966. The object appeared to be in the vicinity of a jet aircraft, however, I am certain this object was not a part of the aircraft, or caused by it. Would you please send me two copies of the UFO report form for us to fill out.

I am planning to write a research paper like to know if at all possible whether any airplane pilot or military reported sighting an unusual phenomenon on Sept. 7, 1965 at 3:35 PM (EST) from 17 miles east of Flint, Mich. Along a line Flint, Hemlock one else did report an unidentifiable phenomenon at that time and place, I would appreciate it very much if I could be given any information concerning the sighting to be used in my paper, or the names and addresses of any such observers in order that I could contact them for information. This is very important, and any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

Would you also please send me a copy of the Air Force booklets, "Aide to Identification of Flying Objects" and a copy of the most recent Department of Defense release concerning UFOs.

Thank You Very Much,

If the trail had not remained constant in length & smugly have thought it was an air plane with vapor trail going into the rising sun altho it did not resemble one at all. The sun is not up at this time. Venus is just emerging. I thought it must be a comet and called to find out if one was visible at this time. It seemed to be traveling down and not horizontal.

If any conclusion are reached I would appreciate a report.
