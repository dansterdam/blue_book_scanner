Temperature Gradients

Air Technical Intelligence Center (AFCIN-L82g (Major Friend))
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1.  Reference paragraph 15g(7), AFR 200-2.

2.  Request that temperatures gradient be defined. The weather forecasters
    this base say that temperatures gradients could be measured at one
    elevation or between two or more elevations. Moreover it could be measured
    between two points on the ground.

3.  The answer to the above request will enable this headquarters to fully
    fill more adequately the provisions of AFR 200-2 in reporting of tempera-
    ture gradients.

FOR: 9g Assist Tactical Fighter Wing (TAC), Attn: TP/DO/LM,
     England Air Force Base, Louisiana

Reference paragraph two of basic correspondence, temperature gradient
as used in AFR 200-2 is considered as being the vertical temperature
gradient, or lapse rate. For analysis purposes, the requirement is for
the temperature change with altitude in the vicinity of the sighting
in order to determine the presence or absence of a temperature inversion.

W. INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, CAPTAIN [ILLEGIBLE] ENGLAND
AFB LOUISIANA. BOTH OBSERVERS, A & B, WERE ATTENDING A FIVE-

FALLING STARS AND METEORITES BEFORE AND THAT THIS SIGHTING
APPEARED QUITE DIFFERENT IN AS MUCH AS IT DID NOT APPEAR TO
MOVE. OBSERVER "B" HAD BEEN SCANNING THE SKY FOR THIS OBJECT
AFTER HAVING BEEN TOLD BY OBSERVER "A" THAT HE HAD SEEN A
BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY. BOTH OBSERVERS PLACED THE OBJECT
AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME POINT IN THE SKY. OBSERVER "A"
STATED THAT IN BOTH OF HIS OBSERVATIONS, THE OBJECT WAS LOCATED

PAGE FIVE FJWJFT 2A
IN THE "LITTLE OF THE CUP PORTION OF THE "BIG DIPPER". TWO OTHER
OBSERVERS, ONE AT THIS DRIVE IN AND ONE AT THE "WINGS" DRIVE-IN
LOCATED IN ANOTHER SECTION OF TOWN, OBSERVED SIMILAR OBJECTS
AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME. IN THE LATTER CASE THE OBJECTS
WERE MOVING. A REPORT OF THE LATTER SIGHTING IS COVERED IN
PART II OF THIS REPORT. EVERY AVAILABLE MEANS WAS USED BY THE
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER TO ARRIVE AT A POSSIBLE CONCLUSION.
