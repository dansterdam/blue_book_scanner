9 April, 1963.

Sgt Moody AFB. Local investigation
revealed that there were no other witnesses. Sighting
was South of Robbins. Witness has reported objects
previously and is considered possibly a "kook". If
object was sighted it was probably an A/C or
misinterpretation of some conventional object. This
information obtained from Sgt Mereagh.

T/Sgt Moody.
