The observer stated that during the observation a hazy cloud cover moved into the area of observation. The description is consistent with that of a star or planet. The observer sighted a star-like point-source of light. Through binoculars the observer could see regular flashes of red and green. The light was initially seen at 45 degrees elevation and during the observation it remained in the same spot but seemed to drop slightly out of sight.

M2MO FOR THE RECORD
14 AUGUST 1968
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 12 August 1968
Road, Kettering, Ohio, called the Aerial Phenomena Office on 13 August 1968 to see if they had identified the object he observed on the night of 12 August 1968. Mr. said that the report had been phoned in by himself on the night of 12 August.
Lt. Marano informed Mr. that we had not received the report from the city officer as of yet; however, could he provide some of the details over the phone.
TIME: 1130 - 1200 pm, EDT
DURATION: thirty minutes
ELEVATION: 30 - 40 deg above the horizon, SSW
The object appeared as a white light with red and green flashing lights. It was motionless, it seemed to move out of sight in a straight line from where he first saw it. It kept dropping a little lower on the horizon. When Mr. first saw it, it was very clear with many stars and the moon visible. When he last observed the object there was a little bit of a cloud (hazy or streaking cloud coverage) in that area. To the naked eye it had the appearance of a star. With binoculars "I could see that appeared to be self-illuminating light." There were regular intervals of flashing or revolving or pulsing, fairly distant from Mr. Ford. said he had to use binoculars to even see any of it. It was completely motionless for twenty minutes. "When I was on the phone my little girl saw it and said it just seemed to drop slowly, faded out."

or sight." As far as Mr **** could estimate the object was at 30 - 40 degrees of elevation. Mr **** said he was fairly good at knowing his angles and elevations he had a course in astronomy, however, that was quite some time ago so he couldn't make any of the stars in the area. What he sighted the object with was a telephone pole that was close by to make his observations because he wanted something permanent so that he could spot it again and give a fairly accurate account. Mr Forr said that the gentleman last night (duty officer) did take a lengthy report. Lt Marano said he would like to get the report in his own handwriting. Mr **** said he hadn't called the newspapers and neither does he believe or disbelieve in UFOs, but this was out of the ordinary. Lt Marano asked Mr **** if the object was as bright as Jupiter? Mr **** said it was sitting between a couple of stars. When I called my daughter (17) and I showed her the general direction and she said two or three stars and that is what it appeared to be to the naked eye. The brightness was similar to that of a star. I gave her the binoculars and then she saw it to. It looked like one of these big dome lights on an emergency vehicle revolving light, it looked similar to this. The light appeared to be of an earth made origin but I couldn't figure out what it would be doing up so high at night. This was my first gathering of what it should be, a helicopter light or something like that. The moon was about 100 - 110 degrees on a circular plane from the object, in other words, the moon was in an ENE location. I have never had a compass out to my house to get a positive location as to what is exactly north and south. There were other stars in the area, they were all dimming because of cloud cover. At approximately 12:30 my daughter and I went out and there were no stars showing.

The image contains a compass-like diagram in the upper portion, as well as two smaller sketches in the lower portion. The compass-like diagram appears to be a tool for approximating the direction of an observed object. The two smaller sketches depict landscapes with a silhouetted human figure in the foreground.

AFR 80-17(CI)

THE FIRST SKETCH SHOWS WHERE PERSON IS STANDING WHEN LAST SEEN. THE SECOND SKETCH SHOWS THE AZIMUTH OR DIRECTION IN WHICH HE SAID HE SAW THE OBJECT. BOTH SKETCHES SHOULD BE DRAWN TO SCALE AND TO SHOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS SEEN, AS FOR EXAMPLE: BUILDINGS, TREES, ROADS, ETC. EVEN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL. IN DRAWING THE LARGER SKETCH, PLACE A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT.

The image contains two illustrations.

The larger illustration is a compass rose with directional labels. This appears to be a diagram intended to help observers indicate the direction and movement of a UFO sighting.

The smaller illustrations below the compass rose appear to show perspective drawings or sketches of a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The left sketch depicts a person standing in the foreground with an expansive landscape in the background. The right sketch shows a close-up view of a rocky or mountainous landscape.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'Y' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'Y' AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE 'X' AND 'Y' WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE

What was the angular size? Hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or the moon. Note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match.
