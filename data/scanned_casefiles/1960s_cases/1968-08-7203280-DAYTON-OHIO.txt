11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a star-like point-source of light through binoculars. The observer could see regular flashes of red and green. The light was initially seen in the south-southwest at about 30 to 40 degrees elevation, during the observation it remained in the SSW but seemed to drop slightly and gradually dimmed out of sight.

The observer stated that during the observation a hazy cloud cover moved into the area of observation. The description is consistent with that of a star or planet.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                   14 August 1963

SUBJ: UFO Observation, 12 August 1963

[Redacted] Road, Kettering, Ohio, called the Aerial Phenomena Office on 13 August 1963 to see if they had identified the object he observed on the night of 12 August 1963. Mr [Redacted] said that the report had been phoned in by himself on the night of 12 August.

Lt Marano informed Mr [Redacted] that we had not received the report from the Duty Officer as of yet, however, could he provide some of the details over the phone.

TIME:                1130 - 1200 pm, EDT
DURATION:           thirty minutes
ELEVATION:          30 - 40 deg above the horizon, SSW

The object appeared as a white light with red and green flashing lights. It was motionless, it seemed to move out of sight in a straight line from Mr [Redacted] it kept dropping a little bit lower on the horizon. When Mr [Redacted] first saw it, it was very clear with many stars and the moon visible. When he last observed the object there was a little bit of a cloud (hazy or streaking cloud coverage) in that area. To the naked eye it had the appearance of a star. With binoculars "I could see what appeared to be self-illuminating light." There were regular intervals of flashing or revolving of green, fairly distant from Mr [Redacted]. He said he had to use binoculars to even see any of it. It was completely motionless for twenty minutes. "When I was on the phone my little girl saw it and said it just seemed to drop slowly, faded out"


- page 5 -

of sight." As far as Mr could estimate the object was at 30 - 40 degrees of elevation. Mr said he was fairly good at knowing his angles and elevations he had a course in astronomy, however, that was quite some time ago so he couldn't name any of the stars in the area.

What he sighted the object with was a telephone pole that was close by to make his observations because he wanted something permanent so that he could spot it again and give a fairly accurate account. Mr Forr said that the gentleman last night (duty officer) did take a lengthy report. Lt Marano said he would like to get the report in his own hand writing. Mr said he hadn't called the newspapers and neither does he believe or disbelieve in UFOs, but this was out of the ordinary. Lt Marano asked Mr if the object was as bright as Jupiter? Mr said it was sitting between a couple of stars. When I called my daughter (17) and I showed her the general direction and she said she saw two or three stars and that is what it appeared to be to the naked eye. The brightness was similar to that of a star. I gave her the binoculars and then she saw it to. It looked like one of these big dome lights on an emergency vehicle revolving light, it looked similar to this. The light appeared to be of an earth made origin but I couldn't figure out what it would be doing up so high at night. This was my first gathering of what it should be, a helicopter light or something like that. The moon was about 100 - 110 degrees on a circular plane from the object, in other words, the moon was in an ENE location. I have never had a compass out to my house to get a positive location as to what is exactly north and south. There were other stars in the area, they were all dimming because of cloud cover. At approximately 1230 my daughter and I went out and there

were streaks of clouds, then clear, etc. I have seen stars blink. There was definitely a red color to this. I am not worried but curious.
