Blue Globe Over Baltimore

At 9 p. m. on 2 July 1962, Mrs. Blanche Rattigan telephoned WFBM, Baltimore to report watching a red flickering flame which seemed appended to a blue-colored balloon-shaped object. The blue object was moving in a northeastern direction against the wind, and below the clouds. WFBM received several calls about it, as did newspapers and Friendship airport, in the area. The object went into a cloud as an aircraft approached from the east and was not seen again.

The image appears to be a scanned document page, but much of the text is very faint and difficult to read. I can make out a few partial lines, but most of the text is illegible due to poor image quality and low contrast. There are some fragments of text visible, but not enough to confidently transcribe a complete sentence or paragraph.
