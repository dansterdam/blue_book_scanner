10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    Navy a pilot reported satellite or bearing   11. COMMENTS
    at 35° from his position appearing at 35°    At 05/1750Z Echo I was at 47°50'N
    above horizon passing E. Object ranged zenith 157-30E and would have appeared to be
    and then disappeared. Determined object      traveling NE to the witness. Echo would

                                                 ported and since the object was identified
                                                 as a satellite a slight error in time is
                                                 considered possible and the case is listed
                                                 as a possible satellite observation.
