11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS 2 boys, 16 & 18 years of age who, according to the investigation are reliable and know (sic) to be responsible youths, observed a luminescence "blob" rise from the ground and ascend with accelerating speed. The sight was that of a brilliant round object which emitted light intermittently and displayed a red glow. The object descended slightly and then resumed its ascent, disappearing at an estimated altitude of 5,000 ft. The boys' accounts vary slightly but indicate the general shape and size (estimated diameter of roughly spherical glow) but it was impossible to obtain satisfactory photographs due to the extreme speed of the object and unpreparedness of the observers. Plasma ball and this could be the explanation, but they are somewhat doubtful.
12. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE None
