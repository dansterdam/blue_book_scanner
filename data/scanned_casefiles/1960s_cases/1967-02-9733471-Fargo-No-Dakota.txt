11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: 2 boys, 16 & 18 years of age who, according to investigating officer and Hynek (who personally investigated the case) appear to have good reliability saw a luminescence "blob" arise from the ground and ascend with acceleration in a northeasterly direction. The night was dark and partly cloudy. Photographs are consistent with verbal accounts by boys and indicate diameter of roughly spherical glow to be 5 feet or somewhat larger. Two polaroid photographs were taken. In outward appearance the glow resembled a hypothetical plasma ball and this could be the explanation if it can be shown that such plasma balls are physically possible.
