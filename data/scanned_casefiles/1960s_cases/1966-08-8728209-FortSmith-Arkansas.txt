Sky Gazers See Something

Fort Smith squinted skyward Monday night, searching for something — flying saucers — unusual phenomena — unidentified flying objects.

Many saw something, they'll tell you.

But just what was a mystery today.

A deluge of reports of unidentified objects sightings were received between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. by the airport, law enforcement officials and radio stations.

There were the stations broadcasting the reports, the more who scanned the skies.

Ed Stacy, chief of the Federal Aviation Agency tower at the Municipal Airport, said personnel observed nothing they could identify.

He said there was nothing not visible on a clear night.

Stacy suggested there were aircraft away up there, their lights on, their jet noise penetrating the thousands of feet between them and earth.

"Reports of this nature occur from time to time," Stacy said. "Reports of sightings began pouring in after midnight."

Included in the sightings, including Fort Smith police patrolmen, told of sighting Sgt. J. W. Gilbreth Jr., 33, a six-year veteran of the Fort Smith Police Department, sighting the objects with his eyes and those of binoculars.

This is how he described them:

Four red lights, stationary but seeming to rotate like a police patrol car warning beacon, were spread out in the sky like points on the corners of a square.

Lights set of red and green lights apparently, then a white beam of light, all moving separately, in straight lines from one to another of the four red lights.

"What we saw were lights," Gilbreth said. "What they were, I can't say."

Gilbreth said he observed them for about an hour. Capt. James Ector, information officer at the base, said that from Jan. 1, 1967, to Dec. 31 last year, 10,067 sightings of unidentified flying objects were reported to the Air Force's satisfaction.

Gilbreth said the lights he saw made no sharp maneuvers.

Fort Smith Air Force Base spokesman said it knew of no air traffic in the area.

"Apparently they saw something over the area that might, but Gilbert did not see the lights out because he was talking with the base personnel at the Little Rock Air Force Base.

The following conversation was monitored over the police radio:

"Car eight to car four — did you see that UFO?"

"Ten-four (transmission signal that means yes or okay)."

Sky Gazers
THESE TEEN-AGE BOYS point to the skies over Fort Smith after spotting a UFO which was seen by many citizens throughout the city and area Monday night. Crowds of from 60 to 600 were seen throughout the city as lights, red and green and white, appeared in the sky. Reports of sightings began pouring in at 9:15 p.m. and they were still trickling in after midnight. What the people saw is still a mystery. (Southwestern Photo)

Air Force Investigating Local Reports of UFOs
By FRANCES MILLER

Capt. James Ector, information officer at Little Rock Air Force Base, was in Fort Smith Tuesday to make a routine investigation on unusual lights in the skies Monday night and before dawn Tuesday.

Hundreds of city and area persons saw the lights which set be half a dozen comment about an unidentified flying object. Writers and newsmen, police officers and the lights — red, green, blue or white — didn't do much but blink on and off.

While the naked eye may not be able to identify an object, this does not mean that it is necessarily unidentifiable. But exactly what it (or they) were remains a mystery.

As far as the visit here Tuesday by Capt. Ector and a commissioned officer from his office, he said: "It was standard operational procedure. We always follow up on sightings such as this.

"Our visit was to try and determine if a further investigation was needed and to obtain photographs if possible. We will continue the investigation until we get what we need."

Capt. Ector said more than likely a member of his staff will come to Fort Smith sometime this week — today, perhaps.

"We will look at photographs and try to determine whether or not the UFO was really just that or if it was a high flying aircraft."

When asked his opinion about the sightings, Capt. Ector said: "While are probably from speculating. The only release that can be made must come from the Foreign Technological Division at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. It's their job to examine the data we give them and then they will either identify what it was or they won't."

The captain said sightings of unusual lights are easy to explain and are usually easy to resolve. (Turn to page 5-A)

an unusual light. I went outside
and looked through my binoculars and saw the light myself."

What was it? "A big sign
advertising a fried chicken restaurant."

Capt. Ector said he and his
NCO obtained a signed statement on their visit here Tuesday from Sgt. J. W. Gilbreth
Jr., 38, a six-year veteran of
the Fort Smith Police Department.

Sgt. Gilbreth viewed the lights
above Fort Smith by eyesight
and with the aid of binoculars.
His description went this way:

"Four red lights, immobile
but seeming to rotate like a police patrol car warning beacon,
were spread out in the sky like
the points on the corners of a
square.

"One set of red and green
lights appeared, traveling in
straight lines from one of the
four red lights and then on to
others. A blinking white light
and later a steady white light
proceeded in the same manner."

"What we saw were lights,"
Gilbreth said. "What they were
on, I can't say."

The sergeant said he observed them for about an hour. He
also saw crowds of 60, 350 and
500 watching the same objects
during the night. One crowd,
listening to a newsman broadcast his description of the
lights, was estimated to number about 1,500.

Capt. Ector said he conducted several other interviews during the day but "they were listening type interviews."

The captain also said: "The
thing over there last night, but
we don't know yet what it is."

He said that since Jan. 1,
1967, there have been 10,047 reports of unidentified flying objects. The Air Force has explained all but 648 to its own satisfaction.

Saucers, Planes or Stars?
Sky Gazers See Something

Fort Smith squinted skyward Monday night, searching for something — flying saucers — unidentified phenomena — or just plain oddities.

But just what was a mystery today.

A deluge of reports of unidentified objects sightings were received between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. by the airport, law enforcement officials and a radio station.

The more the stations broadcast the reports, the more who squinted the skies.

(Ed Stacy, chief of the Federal Aviation Agency tower at the Municipal Airport, said personnel had nothing to do with the sightings.)

He said there was nothing not visible on a clear night.

Stacy suggested there were aircraft away up there, their lights on, their jet engines not penetrating the thousands of feet between sky and earth.

But he said, "I can't say what they were."

Gilbreth said, "What they were, I can't say."

Gilbreth said he observed them for about an hour. Others said the lights were visible for about three hours. Gilbreth said a crowd of about 600 was watching the lights.

Fort Smith police contacted Little Rock Air Force Base about the sightings. The base reported that it knew of no aircraft in the area.

Apparently the same night, but we don't know just what, Jan. 1, 1947, to Dec. 31 of last year, 10,047 sightings of unidentified flying objects were reported and all but the Fort Smith sightings were to the Air Force's satisfaction.

Gilbreth said the lights he saw made no sharp maneuvers.
