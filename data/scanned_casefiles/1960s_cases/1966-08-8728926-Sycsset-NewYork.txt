OCT 28 1966

Dear [redacted]

Reference is made to your recent letter regarding your unidentified flying object observation on August 17, 1965.

ECHO I was passing over central New York on August 17, at 8:54 p.m. ECHO I, the 100-foot aluminum sphere, served as a radio reflector for the first four and one-half months of its life, before solar radiation and meteoroids reduced its reflecting power. However, this satellite is not visible for thirty minutes.

According to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, there are more than 30 satellites with visual magnitudes of 3 or brighter. If you wish to know which specific satellite you observed, I would suggest you contact the Space Tracking and Detection Center at Air Force Base, Colorado 80912. They have the responsibility of tracking all satellites, and available satellites.

I hope you will find the above information useful. Thank you for your interest in our program.

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs:

On the evening of August 17, 1966 I spotted an object of the first or second magnitude passing from WNW to ENE over Syosset, N.Y. It was a few minutes after sunset, about half past eight, and the object, which I suppose to be a satellite, took approximately thirty minutes to cross the sky.

Would it be possible to send me the name of the satellite I observed?

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
