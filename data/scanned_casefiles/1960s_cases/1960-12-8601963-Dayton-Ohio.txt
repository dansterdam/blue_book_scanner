6. PHOTOS
☐ Yes
☒ No

7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
1 min

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
one

9. COURSE
Varied

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Bright white light which moved at various speeds and then would circle and go away. Appeared 270°, 60-70° fm horizon, disappeared 110°N, 40° fm horizon.

11. COMMENTS
Observer was inside a building, and saw the object at 60-70° elevation, a probable nearest location of about 35°. In the 4 min he was in sight, the object disappeared off and on, moved at various speeds and circled. The information is too general for a valid conclusion. The witnesses are abundant, therefore difficult to contact for the purpose of getting more information. There is insufficient data in the report for a conclusion. Possibility of light reflection.
