Dear Sirs:

On March 3, 1968 a total of 0 witnesses sighted a UFO. There were four weeks ago, visible to my friends. Dave, whose wife told me that my husband (name redacted) had called me at about 7:00 a.m. Sunday morning to tell me that he saw two minutes later, which we saw it in the east leading towards north. It was lighted, as large as a star and he watched it until two minutes later went out sight. My husband and I also saw it while in the world listening post. 

Watching it with this were out of sight. We are hoping to get some data of flight paths for assistance. Thank you.

Respectfully yours,
(Signature redacted)

P.S. Enclosed is a envelope set extracted a drawn away, my retain.
