Dear Sirs,

On the last month I have seen a total of 9 UFOs. These or four weeks ago, while at my friends house, we heard on the radio that one had been sighted southeast of the city. We went out and looked for it. About two minutes later we saw it in the south, heading west. We ran through a schoolyard to keep it in sight. We watched it until it was out of sight then we ran back to my friends house. We got his dad to take us out into the country to get a better look at it. When we got out a ways, got out of the car and looked for it but it was gone. After arriving back at his house, we stood outside for a while. Approximately fifteen minutes later we sighted another one. This one was different in appearance, but was blinking in the same general direction he first. We sighted two others that might, three the next night, and two a couple of nights later (all that I have looked the same). I have learned that you have a form that I could fill out to tell you more about all the sightings I've seen. Please send me some of those blanks for the witnesses I have. Thank You.

Respectfully yours,

P.S. In case the envelope gets destroyed or thrown away, my address is [redacted]
