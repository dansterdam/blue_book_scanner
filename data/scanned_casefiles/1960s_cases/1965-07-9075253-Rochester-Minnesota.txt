Total time of crossing was probably only 5 or 6 seconds at the most. It continued upward and finally stopped at about 80 degrees above the horizon and flickered and then the light went out.

DATE OF SIGHTING: 5 JULY 65
PLACE OF SIGHTING: ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA

On the night of 3 July 1965, Three witnesses and myself observed an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Rochester, Minnesota. The sky was clear, no cloud cover, visibility was excellent, temperature was 68°, dew-point 55°, 646 humidity, and the winds were out of the southeast 5 knots. The sighting was at 2153 DST, 1st location 43 degrees 55' north, 92 degrees 30' west. Total observation time was 3 minutes. Method of observation was with the naked eye, through a telescope and binoculars. Atmospheric conditions were recently been cleared and checked in daylight.

DETAILS

As stated earlier, my wife and I had just been sitting in the house talking about UFOs, etc., when our neighbor brought up the subject of a large telescope sitting in the house. And just exactly how such could be seen with this procedure to explain that it gave a very good view of the major planets in our solar system, as well as other celestial objects that are really quite interesting to view under the open conditions. Then decided to set the telescope up in the back yard, which incidentally is in a residential area many back yards, quite a few obstructions.

The moon was at approximately 50 degrees above the horizon to the WSW, in a half moon size, with the northern most half being in very brilliant light. The telescope was first of all focused on a low power lens to set a larger image, then a higher power lens was fitted along with the Barlow lens and quite a spectacular view was offered to one who had never seen anything through a telescope such as this. At this time our wives came to the back yard, my wife bringing a pair of 7x35 binoculars, and she lent them to me. I look at the moon. The moment they stepped out of the door, my attention was drawn to a very bright light at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon which was red and blinking once using a tower light for a radio antenna. I asked Mr. if possibly I could use the scope. Just and bring the light into focus, as it had aroused my curiosity, being that it was not moving, and we had never noticed a tower light before, without bothering to change the lens in the scope, I focused in on the light which really didn't seem to be blinking. I made note of the time and continued to watch it, until I realized it steadily was moving. Its axis of rotation, and this I know was moving with a light increase in speed, and then suddenly it appeared if a small part of it had fallen away. And turned up. My wife remarked that she had lost the object from the light veil, reflected by the moon, but I could still make it out as it traveled nearer. Suddenly, it appeared could be made out as it entered this intense light, and it appeared to be going and like up, just a row of lights, nothing else. In the matter of seconds it took to cross the surface of the moon, there was something that made me realize right there that this was

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
No. This object was different than anything I have ever seen before in more than 20 years as an air traffic controller.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One)   Yes   No
31.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One)   Yes   No

Air Traffic Control Specialist
Rochester Tower
Rochester, Minnesota

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME [redacted]
ADDRESS [redacted]
Rochester, Minnesota

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
Former military pilot. Air Traffic controller for more than 20 years.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
No one   Day ____   Month ____   Year ____

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   Sept   2   1965
                                                     Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object disappeared before it rose so that a cloud formation lying about 60 degrees above the horizon would have given an indication as to its altitude.

If it had gone behind or beneath these clouds, an accurate height observation could have been made. With no more of chance, I would estimate that the object was probably within 10 or 15 miles of the airport. If you have additional reports, an indication of its distance could be made by triangulation as the relative bearing from the airport is quite definite.

Strictly as a guess, I would associate the object assessed with the fourth of July weekend. My feeling is that the object was attached to a gas filled balloon or a host source used to raise a plastic balloon. The speeds as observed were not such as could not meet the criteria for such an object.
