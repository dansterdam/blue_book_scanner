THE REPORTED SIGHTING
1. (a) Time: 1905 to 1915 
(b) Date: 9 September 1965
(c) Location: Damon, Texas

2. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
At approximately 1905 hours on 9 September 1965, the reporting witness, who was driving on the Damon-Danbury road southeast of Damon, Texas, observed a bright light in the sky. The light was stationary and approximately 20° above the horizon in the southwest. The witness observed the light for about 10 minutes.
At approximately 1915 hours, the light began moving slowly to the northwest, maintaining its altitude of about 20° above the horizon. The light then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.
The witness described the light as brilliant white in color, larger than a star, and very bright. No other lights or objects were observed in the vicinity. The sky was clear and the visibility was excellent. No sounds were heard.

3. INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
The investigator was unable to identify the object observed. The location and description of the object are consistent with the observation of an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

9 SEPTEMBER 1965
On 9 September 1965, an Air Force Report of Investigation was filed from Damon, Texas. The report states that at approximately 1030 hours, the witness observed a silver-colored object hovering approximately 35 feet above the ground in a field adjacent to Highway 6, about 4 miles south of Damon, Texas.
The object was reported to be round or disc-shaped, approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.
The witness was a male civilian, age 52, who was traveling northbound on Highway 6 when he observed the object. No other witnesses were reported.
The investigating officer concluded that the object was most likely an aircraft, and the case was classified as "Insufficient Information" due to lack of physical evidence or corroborating witnesses.

DAMON, TEXAS
3 SEPTEMBER 1965

TWO Deputy Sheriffs were driving south on Highway 36 from Damon, Texas. towards the horizon in the northeast, they sighted a bright purple light. The light was observed to move up and down and side to side. It appeared to remain stationary on the horizon about five to six miles away, and the northwest of their position was about 300 degrees. After a few minutes the light commenced to move horizontally, maintaining a more or less constant elevation. The light appeared to be accompanied by a smaller light, seemingly for purposes of guidance and control. 
The lights momentarily appeared to move in opposite directions before becoming stationary. The lights were observed to change in size, varying from a stellar magnitude of +1.2 to +3.5. The observers were unable to distinguish any other features other than the two bright lights. The car was stopped and the observers watched the object for several minutes. After a while the primary bright light on the left increased in size considerably and appeared to be approaching them. Highway 36 - the observers slowed down. and again the lights were viewed through the windshield as they approached. The lights appeared to move up and down, and sometimes a star-like effect could be seen at the far edge of the lights. The closest the object came to the observers was estimated to be at a rapid speed. The object then came up to the pasture next to the highway. The observers stated the object then appeared to take a course parallel to and about 150 feet above the ground, and then disappeared rapidly. 
After leaving the scene, the observers returned to the same area and again saw the bright purple lights on the horizon and the smaller blue light again appeared that of the larger purple light. After the file light moved to a position higher in the sky, the two lights moved in opposite directions and disappeared.
COMMENTS
At the time of the sighting Antares, with a stellar magnitude of +1.2, was
visible.

Dep't UFO Say Out After Them
(Anglo-Texas Bulletin Bureau Service)
Deputy Sheriff Billy Martin and three other deputies say they saw a "flying saucer" up close Monday night.
The bizarre story of the deputies' experience goes like this:
Last Monday night about 10:30, the deputies were making a routine patrol along a country road near Damon, Texas, when suddenly they spotted a "flying saucer" hovering about 30 feet off the ground.
"It hovered in the light," they said. "It was shaped like a disc on edge. It had a glow around it, and you could see the lights on it. There was a blue one on its right side."
The deputies tried to find a safe place to stop their car and examine the strange object, but suddenly it shot straight up and disappeared from sight.
"We raced for our car and it was coming at us from all sides," said Cooley.
"We hit 80 miles an hour and the thing kept pacing us," a deputy said. "It was increasing our speed."
Say It Hovered
The unidentified object, Cooley said, hovered above the ground a few feet and then, with a brilliant flash on the horizon, suddenly disappeared.
"Then it just disappeared into thin air," the deputies said in their report. "We have seen things in our time, but we have never seen anything like that. They have just completely baffled and flabbergasted us. We just don't know what to make of it. But they say they DID see this thing, and they haven't lost their marbles."

INVESTIGATION

RADIATION:
Readings were taken with a PDR-27C radiac set to determine the existence of beta or gamma radiation. Readings were taken of the background radiation. Radiation was detected when the probe was placed near the alleged landing area. However, it should be noted that no radiation was found on the objects themselves. The readings were taken at the time the object was sighted and the time the readings were taken.

AIR SEARCH:
It should be noted on the enclosed maps that the area of sighting is in the proximity of the Ellington Air Force Base. Although this office is highly suspicious and emphasizes would have been, it nevertheless checked with Houston Interplanetary Research. They have no record of any jet traffic, HOWEVER, NEVERTHELESS the Houston radar coverage extends into the area of the sighting. There was no record of any jet traffic. HOUSTON radar coverage extends into the area of the sighting.

SIGHTING AREA:
The object was sighted in a flat pasture area almost completely void of any vegetation. It was found almost surrounding a farm house and a completely void criss-crossing fences parallel to the river about five miles west of a nearby town. (See diagram nearest drawing.)

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
The Houston area was under the influence of a high pressure area causing clear and stable weather conditions. at the time of the sighting: temperature 92 degrees, winds 10-15 mph from the northeast, visibility clear, eleven miles. This condition persisted from several hours prior to and after the sighting. According to the reports, a strong substance invasion was present during the period in question. A surface-to-ground visibility over 11 miles was reported. Upper air weather conditions have no apparent bearing on this sighting.

CONCLUSIONS:
After talking with both officers involved in the sighting there is no evidence to support a UFO sighting. However, my investigation failed to uncover any facts that permitted me to concur with my investigation knowledge or such opinions as were furnished to me. The persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning- Chief Deputy Sheriff McCoy would qualify as reasonable position for their sighting. It appears considerable ridicule from their contemporaries and the some have attempted to possess the facts of their sighting.  Furthermore, the sighting has stirred up considerable interest in the local newspapers, radio and television outlets these additional circumstances.

Scanning and producing the text from the document:

Bearing 5-2 degrees azimuth. There was a surface radiation inversion during this period from the ground to 300 feet, and a very strong inversion between 3,000 and 12,000 feet. This inversion was strong enough to cause radar reflection between 9,000 and 15,900 feet and could have caused a distortion of Arctares.

The unidentified object was tracked on radar from time of the sighting. They had no records of VHF traffic - Houston radar records indicated no UFO or unusual sightings during the period in question.

The fact that the object disappeared by shooting up 90 degrees into the air mass was unidentified since such an abrupt change in position events an astronomical explanation.

STATEMENT OF DEPUTY SHERIFF BILLY E. McCOY

Deputy Sheriff Goode and I were driving south on Highway 36 from Damon, Texas, to Waller, Texas, on Sunday, September 6, 1953. When we first noticed a purple light stationary on the horizon about 3-5 miles away and southwest of our position, the light appeared to be very bright. As we drove closer, the light seemed to split into two distinct positions before becoming stationary. The lights then flickered up and down in a synchronized motion. The lights were quite bright and featured other characteristics besides the two bright lights. We turned the car around and Deputy Sheriff Goode discussed the lights through binoculars. We decided to travel closer to get a better view. After traveling about 3/4 of a mile on Highway 36, we slowed down, Goode saw his light and called down. We slowed to almost a stop off the edge of the highway and while watching the object, lost sight of it for a few seconds. The object came back into view and appeared to travel west at a tremendous speed. We traveled back to Damon, Texas, and while traveling at a speed up to 110 mph, the object came up behind us and its brilliance apparently caused by its movement away from us. After arriving in Damon, we discussed our experience with the object.

"We headed back toward Damon on Highway 36 and when we got to the area where the larger light had been, the smaller blue light again appeared out of the larger purple light. After the blue light moved exactly as it did the first time, it suddenly went out and we decided to leave the area because we figured that the object would start coming toward us.

We returned to West Columbia and told the City Judge of West Columbia, Jim McGee, and his assistant what we saw. Jim said this officially went over to the area and remained for about an hour and a half but they didn't see anything.

I returned to the area the following 2 nights at approximately the same time and have not seen anything like what we saw the first night. I have been unable to come up with any plausible explanation of what we saw that night. I have not been positive that the object was not any type of aircraft that I know to exist and I have not been able to see anything like it before.

I have been a Brazoria County Deputy Sheriff for 11 years and now occupy the position of Chief Deputy Sheriff. I, Leach, am 28 years old and have been with the Sheriff's Department for 6 years. Neither one of us had anything to drink on the night we saw the lights and the object. We were working the night shift.

The area where we saw the object is in Damon's area of responsibility and we were on patrol in that area at the time. The night was clear and there were no other lights in the area where we saw the object.

AFRO Bulletin, Sep-Oct 65

UAO PURSUES POLICE

(Their car was rocked severely; one of the best documented multiplewithness sightings gathered and investigated by AFRO in the past year)

On Friday, 3 September 1965 at 12:30 p.m., Deputy Sheriff B. L. Dickey and Deputy Sheriff Bob Goode of Angleton, Texas (South of Damon), were patrolling on the highway between W. Columbia and Damon, Brazoria County, on the highway between W. Columbia and Damon.

According to their affidavit, the deputies suddenly sighted a brilliant purple glow hovering just above the rooftops of the West Columbia area of Brazoria County, on the highway between W. Columbia and Damon. The object was estimated to be anywhere from 50 to 75 feet in diameter. 

McCoy emphasized this was not just an object hovering or flying due to the brilliance of a "welder's light", but purple pulsating light. The object was described in shape as appearing to be a "bell" and "much larger-than-a-car" in size. 

Soon the object began to move closer, and when the deputies drove in its direction, the object began to circle their car, first at a distance of 300 feet, then coming closer, to a distance of 75 to 100 feet. At times the object came within 50 feet of their car. The deputies stated they felt that they were being pursued.

When the object came within 50 feet, McCoy states he could distinguish three rows of small, round windows on the side facing them. Brock stated that at 50 feet the object seemed to pulsate and change colors from deep purple to lighter shades and then to a vivid blue light on the object's "right" side. Blue light on the object's left side seemed to "spread" or surge in its brilliance. Sometimes the colors seemed to "emerge" from the purple light and surge away. 

The deputies stated that after the object had maneuvered around their car, the purple glow at the lower portion suddenly retracted slightly, and the entire object had a profile shape of a "bell" or dome with a "protrusion" underneath the main body. The distance from the roof of the car to the underside of the object was estimated to be about 25 feet at times. According to the deputies, the distance from the nearest edge of the object to their car ranged from 50-75 feet. 

The deputies were shaken up by this experience and afraid, as the object seemed to be examining them and their car. They stated the intense light also illuminated the interior of their car, making it difficult to see outside as the object circled them. The deputies said they felt certain "they were not alone" and that their car was being rocked severely, although it was not lifted off the ground.

Suddenly, as quickly as the object had appeared, it accelerated rapidly away from them at a tremendous rate of speed, straight up and out of sight, disappearing completely. The deputies said they could not determine any discernible sound or exhaust gases or smoke from the object.

Subsequent to the sighting, a thorough aerial and ground search of the area was conducted by other law enforcement agencies but no trace of the object could be found. The deputies insisted they would return to the scene in daylight to further investigate, however, the object did not reappear. Although the object was not seen again, the deputies felt certain that within the next few days or few weeks, after further investigation, they would be able to determine the exact distance from the initial position of the object to their car, estimated to be 100 to 150 feet above ground level and parallel to their car. This movement was approximately 100 feet.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

As it neared them, the brilliant purple light illuminated the ground and the interior of their car completely. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was round in shape. It hovered over the car and then moved away very rapidly. As it did so it was seen to cast a huge shadow on the ground, and the officers could see it through the shadow.

As it reached Damon, the lawmen climbed down and decided to check the area. They talked to a Mr. McCoy, who was on his way to visit his brother, and he told the AF that he also had seen the object. Again, the sheriffs reported the object would start coming toward us, as if it were going to land, and then quickly swing away like a pendulum.

Later - near anything like it before," McCoy concluded.

"I haven't seen anything like it before," McCoy concluded.

The officers are not noted for being easily frightened. However, Dexter McCray and Deputy Sheriff S.P. Jones, of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office, stated that they were awed by this experience.

Just south of Damon, Texas, about 26 miles from Lincoln, Nebraska, they observed one of a number of brilliant mysterious lights over the highway. At first they thought it was an airplane, but as they continued to watch, it became obvious it was something very unusual.

It seemed to hover over the road and hovered there, not moving for five or six minutes. Then it would dart off, go a little piece, and hover over the road again. It seemed to almost be playing with them as they drove along.

"I don't know how long it was there. It was just too damned strange!" one of the officers later told a USAF investigator. If was growing dark, the object had an amber or reddish glow, and it seemed to change position rapidly, according to the report. The object was sighted about 7:30 p.m., just as it was getting dark.

15 to 18 in diameter, maybe four to five inches thick. The object was metallic, and giving off a bright or glow in the middle. It had a dim spot on it and it might have been a wing or something.

The thing went across the sky. It came from the south and moved fast, going to the northeast. "Those things are bound to be alarmed just like we are, and they have got some intelligence in the way they maneuver." 

During the first week of August, 1954, a resident of Redlands, West Australia, reported Cows being frightened by a bright object low in the sky. It flew silently and gave off a glow like the moon. The object dived sharply, then climbed rapidly out of sight near Carnarvon when a flying object passed over their headlights and brakes. Mr. Kubo saw the object again over Carnarvon that same night.

"It was rocking gently," Dr. Kubo said later. "And again, I call it rocking, because I am trying to describe the motion as nearly as I can."

By Koula said she was thrown from the back seat, bucked up. She passed out for a few minutes, she said, and when she came to, the object had gone.

Dr. Kubo said the evidence was that those who had the encounter did not feel the object had been man-made. For, after the UFO had left the scene, their car would not start up right away. They say that their whole car was "lit up like a Christmas tree," and that the car radio wits "absolutely no good." The car was a modern one and in perfect working order,

But Dr. Kubo claimed he could not be sure of. Just what it was. There were too many unanswered questions. "If, he said, "this was a real UFO, then there is enough more evidence to prove their existence. But the questions are still there, and there is not enough to say positively what it was."

The recent NICAP poll (still being analyzed) shows that 95% of the members of the public who have seen UFOS feel that the objects are not of this world. They don't believe they are any kind of planes or satellites or anything like that. The poll also shows that most people will be alarmed by sudden close encounters with UFOS.

Most of us will agree that fear of the unknown is far worse than fear of the known. If it is recognized that there are different kinds of UFOS, and those that are non-hostile, the most stupid policy one could devise, would be to increase fear, rather than to increase knowledge.

These incredible machines and landings will keep happening around the country, or maneuvers at low altitudes over a number of cities. People would be alarmed. Millions of people would be observing, and they are bound to spread the news. They have got to be given some assurance that the authorities are doing everything possible to find out what's going on, and prepare people, as calmly as possible, for further landings and close observations, before some incident causes a national catastrophe.

Members' opinions and suggestions for solving this problem will be very much appreciated.

The image contains two elongated shapes that appear to be drawn or sketched, with multiple arrows pointing towards them. The text below the image describes the observation, stating that when first observed from a distance, the light appeared to move to the right and stop, then to the left and stop, before continuing to move. The text also notes that no shape or body could be seen at that distance, only the lights.

WHEN FIRST OBSERVED AT A DISTANCE 
LIGHT APPEARED TO MOVE TO RIGHT AND STOP
THEN TO LEFT AND STOP
BEFORE CONTINUING TO STOP ON RIGHT
NO SHAPE OF BODY COULD BE SEE AT THIS DISTANCE - ONLY LIGHTS

This image appears to be a sketch or drawing of a large, elongated UFO object. The object is depicted as a dark, blurry shape against a white background, with some text at the top indicating it is a "40.50 FT THIN CENTER" object. The text at the bottom states "As seen at approx. 500' distance" and "He said it had a glow which gave it's shape." There does not appear to be any photographic image present in this document.

The image appears to be a photograph or drawing of a flying saucer-shaped object. The object is described as being approximately 200 feet in length, with a dome-like shape on top. Below the image, there is handwritten text that states "As seen at approx 150' distance and as shown in air. He [the witness] had made a sketchy which gave his impression of object as shown here."

WEIRD UFO INCIDENT IN TEXAS: On the night of September 3rd, two police officers had a terrifying encounter with a UFO near Damon, Texas. The object, 200 feet long and 50 feet in diameter, approached so close to their patrol car, that its eerie light was visible on the ground. The officers panicked and left the area at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Later that night they returned. The same or a similar UFO again swooped down on their car, and again they left the area rapidly. They did not come back for a third try.

The really unusual aspects of the case are the following: An open sore on one officer's arm was apparently healed by heat and light from the UFO. The policeman, named Geo Goode, had had his arm out the window of the patrol car during the sighting, and later found that an infected wound had healed suddenly.

The second wild aspect was the fact that Goode was visited by two men shortly after the incident, who told him to tell about the sighting, and advised him not to cooperate with any being on board, as he should "try to co-operate with anything he sees." The identity of these two mysterious men is apparently not known.

An on-the-spot Air Force investigation of the affair failed to solve anything. Major Lawrence R. Laiish, Jr., of nearby Ellington Air Force Base, concluded that "both officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning." (Texaro-Sport Facts, Freeport, Texas, 9/6/65-9/9/65.)
