DAMON, TEXAS
3 SEPTEMBER 1965

Two Deputy Sheriffs were driving south on Highway 36 from Damon, Texas, toward West Columbia at approximately 2300 on Friday, 3 September 1965. About three miles south of Damon, a very bright purple light, that was stationary on the horizon about five to six miles away, and somewhat of their position was noted. After a few seconds a smaller blue light appeared out of the larger purple light and traveled to one right of the original purple light, dropping momentarily in two distinct positions before becoming stationary. The lights then floated upwards to an angle about 5 - 100 above the horizon. The objects remained at a distance of five to six miles and the observers were unable to distinguish any other features other than the two bright lights. The car was turned around and attempts were made to get closer to the lights. At one time binoculars were used to view object. After traveling about 3/4 of a mile down Highway 30, the observers slowed down, and again the lights were viewed through binoculars. The observers slowed to almost a stop, off the edge of the highway, and while watching the lights, they stared coming toward the witness at a rapid speed. The object came up to the pasture next to the highway, about 150 feet off the highway, and about 100 feet high. The bulk of the object was plainly visible at this time and appeared to be triangular shaped with a bright purple in color, less bright, less brilliant, blue light on the right end. The bulk of the object appeared to be dark gray in color with no other distinguishing features. The object appeared to be approximately 200 wide and 40 - 50 thick in the middle, tapering off toward both ends. There was no noise nor any kind of trail. The bright light illuminated the ground directly underneath it and the area in front of it, including the highway and the interior of the patrol car. One observer stated he felt heat that was apparent; emanating from the object. As the observers headed back toward Damon, the observer continued to watch the object out of the back window at a very rapid speed. The object appeared to move from a point approximately 200 seconds, and then move off in the direction were they first saw it at a very high speed. While it was in motion the smaller blue light, on the right side, disappeared entirely and the larger purple light became smaller but retained its brilliance apparent, caused by its movement away from them. After arriving at approximately its original position, it went straight up in the air and disappeared at 25 - 300 above the horizon.

After leaving the scene the observers returned to the same area and again saw the original purple light on the horizon and the smaller blue light again appeared out of the larger purple light. After the blue light moved exactly like it did the first time and became stationary, the lights again left the air at about 5 - 100. Observers left the scene because they figured that the object would move again.

Dept. Say
UFO 'Out
After Them

(Chronicle News Service)

Angleton—Before Friday night, you had talked about flying saucers to Deputies Billy McCoy and Bob Goode, they would have looked at you like you had lost your last marble.

Today, these still-chuckling deputies agree that you possibly did see a flying saucer. In fact, they hurriedly say "Me, too."

Friday night they were returning from a football game at Damon. It was a beautiful night. You could see for miles on the almost brushless prairie.

Suddenly they saw a strange object—they say—in a pasture alongside the road.

"Purple Light"

"It hovered in the air. It was eerie," they said. "It was shaped like a triangle—200 feet long and 50 or 60 feet high. It had a purple light on its left side and a blue one on its right side."

They said it hovered just above the ground. It made no noise.

The deputies tried to find a gate to let them in the pasture where they could examine the object closer.

"It's coming toward us," said McCoy.

"Oh, no," said Goode as they raced for their car and took off.

It was coming at them at terrific speed.

"We hit 90 miles an hour and was gaining on us," said McCoy. "We increased our speed, but it kept gaining."

Say It Hovered

Then suddenly it stopped. But the deputies didn't. The "thing" covered above the ground a few yards.

The brilliant lights on the object illuminated a wide area. Then it disappeared.

Deputies McCoy and Goode were family then. In their long years as peace officers, they had never been taught to remain calm, to inspect objects—inanimate and man-made—with a careful eye. They have never believed people who said they saw flying saucers.

They are not flustered easily. But they say they saw this strange object and they don't know what to look at them like they have lost their marbles.

INVESTIGATION

RADIATION:
Radiation readings were taken with a PDR-27C radiac set to determine the existence of beta or gamma radiation. Readings were taken of the vehicle, clothing (left sleeve) of Deputy Sheriff Goode, and the pasture area next to Highway 36 where the object was reported to have hovered. No indication of the presence of radiation was found. However, it should be noted that there were two periods of rainfall between the time the object was sighted and the time readings were taken.

AIR TRAFFIC:
It should be noted on the inclosed maps that the area of sighting is in the immediate vicinity of the Victor 20 airway. Although the officers emphatically denied that the object was an aircraft, and it is highly improbable that it could have been, I nevertheless checked with Houston Air Traffic Control Center. A review of their records indicated that there was no IFR traffic. Houston radar coverage extends into the area in question but not below 2000 feet. (The minimum altitude for Victor 20 is 2000 feet). Houston radar records indicated no UFO or unusual sightings during the period in question.

SIGHTING AREA:
The area where the object was sighted is a flat pasture area almost completely void of trees except a small growth around a farm house and a heavier growth running parallel to the river about five miles from Highway 36. (See inclosure/house in the area).

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
The Houston area was under the influence of a high pressure area causing cloudless skies and good visibility. The official surface weather conditions at Ellington Air Force Base (approx. 40 miles northeast of the area in question) at 2300 hours (CST) were: Ceiling and visibility area in question at 29.86, temperature 74 degrees, dew point 72 degrees. A surface radiation inversion was present during the period from 8000-10,500 feet. A very strong subsidence inversion was present between 8000-10,500 feet. This inversion was strong enough to cause radar refractions. Upper air weather conditions have been omitted since they have no apparent bearing on this sighting.


- page 21 -

CONCLUSIONS:

After talking with both officers involved in the sighting there is no doubt in my mind that they definitely saw some unusual object or phenomenon. However, my investigation failed to uncover any facts that permitted me, with my meager knowledge of such things, to arrive at any explanation for the unusual sighting. Both officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed, and persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning. Chief Deputy Sheriff McCoy holds a responsible position in the department requiring the supervision over 42 personnel. Both officers have been subjected to considerable friendly ridicule. From their contemporaries and the local townspeople, but, have continued to profess the facts of their sighting. Furthermore, the sighting has stirred up considerable interest in the local newspapers, radio, and television causing them additional embarrassment and inconvenience.

Here is the text from the document:

setting at 240 degrees azimuth. There was a surface radiation inversion during this period from the ground to 300 feet, and a very strong inversion between 5,000 and 10,500 feet. This inversion was strong enough to cause radar refraction. As Antares was setting this inversion between 8,000 and 10,500 feet could have caused a distortion of Antares.

Houston Air Traffic Control reported no IFR traffic in the area at the time of the sighting. They had no records of VFR traffic. Houston radar records indicated no UFO or unusual sightings during the period in question.

The fact that the object disappeared by shooting up 90 degrees into the air makes this case unidentified since an abrupt change in position prevents an astronomical explanation.

STATEMENT OF DEPUTY SHERIFF BILLY E. McCOY

Deputy Sheriff Goode and I were driving south on Highway 36 from Damon, Texas, toward West Columbia at about 11:00 p.m. on Friday, September 3, 1965. When we were about two or three miles south of Damon, I saw a very bright purple light stationary on the horizon about 5-6 miles away and southwest of our position. After a few seconds a smaller blue light appeared out of the larger purple light and traveled to the right of the purple light, poising momentarily in two distinct positions before becoming stationary. The lights then floated upwards to an angle about 5-10° above the horizon. They remained at a distance of 5-6 miles and we were unable to distinguish any other features other than the two bright lights. We turned the car around and Deputy Sheriff Goode looked at the lights through binoculars. We decided to investigate further and headed back toward Damon to look for a back road to take us nearer the lights. After traveling about 3/4 of a mile on Highway 36, we slowed down, Goode had his window open (rolled down) and looked through the binoculars again and the lights appeared to still be in the same position. We slowed down to almost a stop off the edge of the highway and while watching the lights they started coming toward us at a rapid speed. The object came up to the pasture next to the highway about 150 feet off the highway and about 100 feet high. The bulk of the object was plainly visible at this time and appeared to be triangular shaped with a bright purple light on the left end and the smaller, less bright, blue light on the right end. The bulk of the object appeared to be dark gray in color with no other distinguishing features. It appeared to be about 200° wide and 40-50 feet thick in the middle, tapering off toward both ends. There was no noise or any trail. The bright purple light illuminated the ground directly underneath it and the area in front of it, including the highway and the interior of our patrol car. The tall grass under the object did not appear to be disturbed. There was a bright moon out and it cast a shadow of the object on the ground immediately below it in the grass. Deputy Sheriff Goode was in the driver's seat with his left arm laying in the open window. Although he was wearing a long sleeved shirt and a coat, he later said that he felt the heat apparently emanating from the object. We immediately put the car in motion and headed toward Damon as fast as we could go. While traveling at speeds up to 110 mph, toward Damon, I continued to watch the object out of the back window of the car. It appeared to remain in the same position for approximately ten seconds and then move off in the direction where first saw it at a very high speed. There was no noise. While it was in motion the smaller blue light on the right side disappeared entirely and the larger purple light became smaller but retained its brilliance apparently caused by its movement away from us. After arriving at approximately its original position, it went straight up in the air and disappeared at 25-30° above the horizon.

When we got to Damon, we drove slowly through the town, discussed what we saw, and decided to go back to the area and see if the object was still there. We were both scared but still wanted to find out what it was. We decided to take the old Damon-West Columbia road which would put us closer to the area where first saw it. However, we traveled the full length of this road until we turned off to go back on Highway 36 and we didn't see anything.


- page 24 -

We headed back toward Damon on Highway 36 and when we got to the area where we first saw the bright lights we again saw the bright purple light on the horizon and the smaller blue light again appeared out of the larger purple light. After the blue light moved exactly like it did the first time and became stationary the lights floated in the air at about A-100. We decided to leave the area because we figured that the object would start coming towards us again.

We returned to West Columbia and told the City Judge of West Columbia, Jim Scott, about what we saw. Jim and his family went over to the area and remained for about an hour and a half but they didn't see anything.

I returned to the area the following 3 nights at approximately the same time and have not seen anything like what we saw the first night. I have been unable to come up with any plausible explanation of our sightings. There are no ground lights in this area which would cause a reflection. I am positive that the object was not any type of aircraft that I know to exist and I have never seen anything like it before.

I have been a Brazoria County Deputy Sheriff for 10 years and now occupy the position of Chief Deputy Sheriff. I am 38 years old. Deputy Sheriff Goode has been with the department for 10 years and is 50 years old. Neither of us had anything to drink in the night we saw the lights, and there were no clouds. We were working the football game at Sweeny on this night.

The area where we saw the object is in Goode's area of responsibility and we were on patrol duty. The night was clear and there were no clouds or haze. There were some spots of ground fog but not in the area where we saw the object.

UAO PURSUES POLICE

(their car engine was running, no change in the lights and no visible trail)

The purple light seemed more brilliant as it approached. The distance between the two lights appeared to be 200 feet (based on object's length in relation to telephone poles along the highway and their distance from each other). The height of the object appeared to be 40-50 feet. (See sketch). The width and depth from "front" to "back" was undetermined.

The purple light was constantly pulsating and the object between the two lights was rectangular in shape. (See sketch). 40 to 50 feet in height. McCoy emphasized this light appeared to be same height as that of object at center. McCoy saw this light as constantly pulsating purple.

Brilliance of a welder's light, but purple in color. To Goode this light appeared to be a mass of small flashing lights. Blue light on object's "right" was definitely less prominent in size and brilliance than purple light. McCoy recalled that it, too, seemed rectangular in shape when close up.

Goode's car window was down; his elbow was extending outside beyond the window ledge; he states he definitely felt heat from object at this point. Window on McCoy's side was up.

Both witnesses were astounded by UAO's extraordinary rapid approach to the vicinity of their car; by the realization that the object was huge in size, and by the brilliance of the purple light. Goode admitted he panicked upon feeling the heat and drove from the scene as fast as patrol car would accelerate, reaching 110 miles per hour.

"In almost no time". The UFO produced no noticeable ill effects on the men nor did it in any way affect the car or equipment. As they sped from the area, McCoy tried to continue his observation of the object, but it seemed to "snap back" to its original location, slightly above horizon level. McCoy used the expression "snap back" in his description.

Suddenly it shot straight up, the purple light becoming tremendously brilliant, and disappeared completely at what McCoy estimated was a 20 degree elevation above the horizon.

After driving for some time, and attempting to recover from their experience, McCoy insisted that they return to

One of the best documented multiple-witness sightings gathered and investigated by AFRO in the past 8 months is the following which contains complete details:

On Friday, 3 September 1965 at 11 p.m. Chief Deputy Sheriff B. E. McCoy and Deputy Sheriff Bob Goode of Angelton, Texas (south of Houston) were patrolling the West Columbia area of Brazoria County, on the highway between W. Columbia and Damon.

McCoy spotted a brilliant purple glow and was unable to continue to identify source. Officially with McCoy's statement, the Goode driving McCoy on driver's right. Glow soon became discernible as bright light, found in appearance. Next, McCoy noted somewhat smaller, less powerful blue light seemingly "emerge" from purple light and move some distance to its right.

He later realized this effect resulted from object making 900 degree turn so that it "faced" them, and the blue light, which had been parallel with and "hugging" the purple one, now became distinct.

The Goode had maintained until this time that the lights were on field lights, so he swung the car around for a better view as they were now directly opposite the light. McCoy on the side next to pasture. Based on knowledge of terrain and upper further investigation in daylight, McCoy and Goode estimated the point was 5 to 7 miles from the highway. Although our investigator occasionally used the word object in his report, there was nothing but two lights visible until this point.

McCoy feels certain that within the next three or four seconds, after the car was turned around, the object traversed the distance from its initial position to a spot approximately 150 feet from the highway, 100 feet above ground level and parallel to their car. This movement

Here is the OCR text from the document:

From an examination of recent fear reports, it appears that
sightings are the quickest to panic—people who have a copied or
final denials of UFOs' existence. One such case involved two
Texas lawmen, both graduates of police schools—Chief Deputy
W. E. McCoy and Patrol Deputy Robert Goode, of Angleton.

By coincidence, this incident occurred on Sept. 3, the same night
as the Exeter state. The following details are from the officers'
signed report to NICAP and a signed copy of their statement to an
Air Force investigator, Maj. Lawrence R. Legler, Hq. 2878 Air Base
Squadron, Ellington AFB, Texas.

After midnight, near Damon in Brazoria County, the two sheriffs
sighted an enormous flying object from their patrol car. In the
bright moonlight, they could see it was about 200 feet long, 40-50
feet high, with a brilliant purple light at one end and a brilliant
purple light at one end, a fainter blue one at the other.

Sheriff Goode turned the patrol car around, drove back three-
fourths of a mile and stopped. As they were watching through
binoculars, the strange craft came down to 100 feet, heading
rapidly toward the lighted police car. In the moonlight, the UFO
cast a huge shadow on the ground, and the officers could see it
moving swiftly toward the highway.

Fifty Yards Away

As it neared them, the brilliant purple light illuminated the
ground and inside of the car. Sheriff Goode, leaning out the
driver's side, suddenly felt heat from the approaching UFO. He
hastily started the engine. By this time the huge flying object was
barely 50 yards away.

With understandable panic, the sheriffs fled.
"We were traveling at speeds up to 110 miles an hour," McCoy
told the AF.

When they reached Damon, the lawmen calmed down and decided
to go back.

"We were both scared," McCoy frankly admits. "But we wanted
to find out what it was."

But when they returned to the area, the UFO's lights began to
shine again. They could see the same craft, same position, same
exact way.

"We circled the object would start coming toward us again,"
McCoy said in his AF statement. In describing the UFO, he said
the body appeared dark gray. There was no sound, nor any trail
visible.

"I never saw anything like it before," McCoy concluded.
Both officers admitted they had not believed in UFOs before.
"I've always been skeptical about these things," said McCoy.
"I'm not a believer any more."

Truck drivers, like policemen, are not noted for being easily
scared. But Don Tennant, a Beatrice, Nebraska truck driver, had
a close encounter of the night of August 4, when a three-mile
disc buzzed him.

"It was en route to Lincoln, Nebraska, about 25 miles from
Abilene, I guess. It was near 1:30 a.m. when all of a sudden the
lights on my truck went out. Then they came back on, then off,
then on again."

"About then, this thing went over my truck with a sizzling or
buzz-like sound. It scared hell out of me; it seemed to
almost touch the cab.

"It just swooped down over the road and hovered there, not
more than 100 feet in front of me. I tell you I was standing on
those brakes. It looked like it was going to fall right in the middle
of the road. When it stopped there was another car approaching
from the opposite direction, and it went into the ditch. Later the
other driver told me it looked like a car accident, but he got
closer.

"I don't know how long it was there. I was just too damned
scared to tell time. The thing looked around me. It was orange
like the color of a traffic policeman's jacket, I guess it was about

15 feet in diameter, maybe four to five feet thick. The edge was round and there was a hump or something in the middle. It had a metallic appearance and was hovering over the highway.

"The thing raised up a bit and slowly took off," toward the west.

Whether witnesses believe in UFOs or not, such experiences are bound to be alarming. And they have been reported frequently in the U.S. and other countries.

Australian Encounter

During the first week of August, two residents of Neeland, West Australia jumped from their car, fearing a UFO was about to hit them. The incident occurred near Caraween when a flying object hovered over their headlights.

Dr. Kukla hurriedly stopped and switched off his lights. As he and Mrs. Lawrence ran to the side of the road, the UFO swooped and hovered above the highway.

"It was rocking gently," Dr. Kukla said later. "And it was colored as it dived had changed to fluorescent green."

The doctor's bull terrier, usually first out of the car when stopped, was crouched in the back seat, hackles up, refusing to budge.

Dr. Kukla said the object was shaped like a "squashed football."

"I had the fear that whatever it was, it was not man-made," he reported, after the UFO had left the scene.

The sighting appeared partly confirmed by resident Ron Butler, owner of nearby Mooka Station, but he said that his entire camp had been lit up by a greenish glow, "something" passed over it, though he could not be sure of it.

There are only a few sample of reports, including NICAP groups, in which the evidence is strongly against it. We have said there is no proof of hostility, that the evidence is strongly against it. We have said despite a few head-on passes at planes, three or four near misses with airliners, the loss of three AF officers in UFO cases, and other incidents. With all the thousands of harmless encounters, so-called, these relatively few accidents were the result of too close observation or perhaps mechanical failures or mistaken identity.

The recent NICAP poll (still being analyzed) shows that 90% of our members are convinced that UFO landings would not frighten them. But specific incidents, like the cases already described, show that most people will be alarmed by sudden close encounters.

Are officials justified, then, in withholding UFO facts, in trying to hide landed incidents, as in the Exeter case?

Most of us will agree that fear of the unknown is far worse than fear of the known—even if it is something frightening. The late Dr. Carl Jung, noted Swiss analyst and NICAP member, wrote the director that withholding information on UFOs from the public could be the most stupid policy, one certain to increase fear rather than lessen it.

The indications are that close approaches and landings will keep on increasing. If a large number of UFOs should land at points around the country, or whenever at low altitudes over a number of cities, the reaction could be serious. Millions of people, accustomed to thinking of UFO as jokes, would abruptly realize that something ominous had been hidden even if there was not the slightest sign of any hostility.

It is far better to get the truth out in the open and prepare people, as calmly as possible, for further landings and close encounters before some sudden development makes gradual and reasonable preparation impossible.

Members' opinions and suggestions for solving this problem will be very much appreciated.

WEIRD UFO INCIDENT IN TEXAS: On the night of September 3rd, two police officers had a terrifying encounter with a UFO near Damon, Texas. The object, 200 feet long and 50 feet in diameter, approached so close to their patrol car, that its eerie light was visible on the ground. The officers panicked and left the area at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Later that night they returned. The same or a similar UFO again swooped down on their car, and again they left the area rapidly. They did not come back for a third try.

The really unusual aspects of the case are the following: An open sore on one officer's arm was apparently healed by heat and light from the UFO. The policeman, named Bob Goode, had had his arm out the window of the patrol car during the sighting, and later found that an infected wound from an alligator bite had healed suddenly.

The second weird aspect was the fact that Goode was visited by two men shortly after the incident, who told him in detail about the sighting, and advised him that, should he have another such encounter, he should "try to cooperate with any being on board, and keep to himself any conversation he might have with such beings." The identity of these two mysterious men is apparently not known.

In on-the-spot Air Force investigation of the affair failed to solve anything. Major Laurence R. Leach, Jr., of nearby Ellington Air Force Base, concluded that "both officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning."

This image appears to be an aeronautical or navigational chart of the Houston, Texas area. The map is densely populated with lines, markers, numbers, and annotations typical of aviation route maps. Key features include:

- "HOUSTON" is prominently labeled near the center of the map
- Various city and location names are visible around the map (e.g., Galveston, Chambers County)
- Multiple lines and markers with alphanumeric codes
- Elevation or altitude markers (e.g., "3000 MSL", "2500 MSL")
- Numerous triangular and circular markers with associated numbers and codes

The map appears to be a detailed navigational chart showing flight paths, waypoints, and other aviation-related information for the Houston metropolitan and surrounding coastal area.

This image appears to be a map with various lines, roads, and circular markings. Some text is visible but mostly illegible due to the image quality. The only clearly readable text I can see is "8°30'E" near the bottom right of the map. The map seems to show a geographical area with multiple intersecting lines, roads, and circular reference points or radii.
