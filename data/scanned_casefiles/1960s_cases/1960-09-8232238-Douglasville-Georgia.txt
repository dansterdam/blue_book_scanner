10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
3 objects were observed at different times. Object nrs 1 and 3 initially observed at same time. Object nr 2 observed approx 3 to 4 hrs later, on 28, 29, 30 Sep and 1 and 9 Oct.

Objects much brighter than any star, possibly 10 times brighter than evening star. Path of all objects was wavy from observer in general straight line, with occasional dance-like movements.

12. CONCLUSIONS
□ Was Balloon
□ Probably Balloon
□ Possibly Balloon
□ Was Aircraft
□ Probably Aircraft
□ Possibly Aircraft
□ Was Astronomical
□ Probably Astronomical

□ Other
□ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
□ Unknown

11. COMMENTS
Descriptions, motions and other characteristics of the objects reported by the witnesses fit such astronomical objects as planets and stars. An example is the #3 object fits in every way the planet Jupiter. From the available information it is impossible to determine if there were any other contributing factors. It is concluded that the objects viewed were probably astronomical objects.

ATTN OF: 320IN

SUBJECT: Additional Information - UFO Sighting

TO: ATIC (AFCIN-422X)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

15 NOV 1960

1. Reference is made to message AFCIN-422X 11-3209-8, 31 October 1960, Request for Additional Information on UFO Sighting near Douglasville, Georgia.

2. The three reported objects were not observed at the same time. Objects number one and three initially observed at the same time. Object number two initially observed approximately three to four hours later.

3. Had they all been observed at the same time, their positions in relation to each other would be an approximate "H". See attachment 1 for diagram.

4. Source stated that objects were much brighter than any star in the sky, possibly ten times as bright as the evening star. He could make no comparison to the star Polaris.

5. Elevation and azimuth of objects when first and last seen were:

a. Object number one: Appeared forty degrees above the western horizon bearing two seven zero degrees. Disappeared over horizon bearing two seven zero degrees.

b. Object number three: Appeared thirty degrees above southern horizon bearing two hundred degrees. Disappeared over horizon bearing two one zero degrees.

c. Object number two: Appeared fifty or fifty-five degrees above western horizon bearing two seven zero degrees. Disappeared over horizon bearing three one five degrees.

6. Path of all objects was away from observer in general straight line, with occasional dance-like movements.

I.P: POINT OF INITIAL APPEARANCE.
VP: POINT OF DISAPPEARANCE OVER HORIZON
DEGREES ARE STATED IN ELEVATION ABOVE HORIZON/BEARING.

The image shows a circular diagram with cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) and additional directional markers. There are multiple points marked with coordinates and labels such as IP (Initial Point) and VP (Vanishing Point). The diagram appears to be tracking the movement or observation of an object across the sky from different positions.
