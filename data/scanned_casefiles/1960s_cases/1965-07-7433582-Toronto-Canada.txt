ITEM:
UFO Observation

Hq USAF SAFSICC (New Bern)
Wash D C 20330

JUL 28 1965

Reference the attached letters from requesting information on their observations of 13 and 19 July 1965.

2. The objects which they observed on the nights of 13 and 19 July 1965 were similar to observations of satellites. The inconsistencies in flight can be attributed to conditions in the atmosphere and illusion of the satellite's appearance as it moves stars or other lights in the sky.

3. The objects were not USAF I or II, PEGASUS I or II. These are the only four satellites on which we have schedules. However, there are two other satellites visible, to be undided UFO and its rays so bright or brighter than USAF I. Identification of the satellites might possibly be obtained from other than the attached Smithsonian Institution ex. NASA.
