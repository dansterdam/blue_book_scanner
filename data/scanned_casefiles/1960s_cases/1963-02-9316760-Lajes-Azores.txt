Here is the text I can read from the document:

WORLD AERO

MIGUEL ISLAND

Vertical Scale
STATUTE MILES

Horizontal Scale
KILOMETERS

Various letter codes/labels are visible on the graph, including:
AL
AK
BK
BL
CK
PC
OL

There are also some small text annotations that are partially illegible due to the image quality.

The document appears to be a graph or chart with multiple axes and coordinate points, likely related to some kind of aerial or navigational data from Miguel Island in the Azores.

Here is the text I can extract from the image:

TACTICAL CHART

Lambert Conformal Conic Projection
Standard Parallels 36°47' and 39°52' Scale 1:1,000,000

(350)

Headings across top: Statute Miles (from 0 to 50)
Vertical axis labels: DL, EL, FL, GL, GK
Horizontal axis labels: DK, EK, FK, GK

Bottom left includes a small inset map of Terceira (an Azores island)

The chart appears to be a navigational or geographical positioning chart with grid lines and coordinate markers.

The text I can see in this image includes:

At the top of the image:
TECEIRA

On the vertical and horizontal axes:
DK
EK
EJ
FJ
FK
GJ
GK

At the bottom of the image:
NAUTICAL MILES
(Joint 349-V)

The image appears to be a nautical chart or map with grid coordinates and a scale of nautical miles. There is a small area labeled "TECEIRA" (likely referring to Terceira Island in the Azores) in the top left quadrant of the map.


- page 6 -

This appears to be a map or chart with grid lines and coordinates. The visible text includes:

SÃO JORGE
PICO
FAIAL
FLORES

At the bottom of the image there is a scale labeled "KILOMETERS" and some numerical coordinates.

The map seems to depict the Azores islands, specifically showing some of the islands in the central and western groups like Pico, Faial, São Jorge, and Flores.

There are also some vertical and horizontal axis labels like "BK", "AK", "PK", and "QK" which appear to be grid reference markers.
