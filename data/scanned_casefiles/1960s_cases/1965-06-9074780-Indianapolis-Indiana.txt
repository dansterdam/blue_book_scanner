September 5, 1965

Under Section 26, you ask for a comparison with some common or familiar object, comparison with a common object escapes me. However it did remind me of a rather uncommon one. The outer chamber or ring reminded me of the accelerating chamber of an atom smasher. There was a pulsing motion of some kind in this space, whether it was a rotating motion or not I am unable to say.

The outer walls of this chamber were quite wide and could be seen very clearly. These lines were a different shade of color or color than the rest of the object. They were not as translucent and appeared to be a tan color.

The movements had to guided by an intelligence of some kind.

It is difficult to estimate the height, but I would say that it was over Ten thousand feet.

One of the things that seemed very puzzling was the way it took off in a straight line across the sky after it had stooped at the 45 degree position. It did not rise by followed a line across the sky at the same height the way a plane would do.

Dear Sirs:

At the risk of being declared nighty, or if death held up to ridicule, I wish to report the sighting of a phenomenon at 5:55 PM Sunday June 20, 1956. This object in the Eastern sky at about 30° above the horizon at a 15 second interval as I really saw it was unbelievable. It seemed to jump up or fly to about a 45 degree angle, then it stopped for

a few seconds, at this time
I yelled for my wife and our
dauty her in law to look but
before any one of them could follow
it streaked across the
sky to the West and disappeared,
It appeared to be a round glisten
and had a low grade of glisten
to it or was some out of light. It
appeared to be smaller than the
appearance of the full moon and
lines were concentric and
rotating. Off publicity. But if the
lie of any help to give it after
it may have some benefit notes
it may help.
