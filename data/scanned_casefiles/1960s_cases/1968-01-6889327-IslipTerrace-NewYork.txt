Dear My[redacted]

January 10, 1968

About 3 minutes ago my girlfriend and I saw some-thing strange.

Without the binoculars it looked just like a white light. Through the binocul-ars it looked like this [hand-drawn sketch of an object]

We don't know what it is. This is the third time we're wrote to you. Please

not Project Blue Book.

(I still didn't receive any
questionnaire from the october 11,
1967 sighting)

THANK YOU
