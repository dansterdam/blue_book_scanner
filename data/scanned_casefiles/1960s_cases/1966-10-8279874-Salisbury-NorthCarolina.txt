11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched two white colored objects that were trailing a B-52 aircraft. One of the objects stopped in the air, turned sideways and parked. The second object came in at an angle to the path of the first object at a speed that made the B-52 look like it was on ox cart going up hill. This second object turned up on edge and appeared to take off with a burst of speed. Then the observers saw something that looked like a mass of metal coming down from the aircraft.

The description is consistent with that of aircraft on a training mission.

Gentlemen,

You may be interested to know that I with four others, observed two unidentified objects trailing a B-52 on the afternoon of Wed. Oct. 12.

One of these objects stopped in the air was seen to flutter and seemed to turn edgewise like the edge of a coin. It was pure white against a blue sky.

The second came in at an angle to the path the first one was traveling off the field where I was parked. It a speed that made the B-52 look like an ox cart going up hill. It continued for a space, seemed to slow down, if it did not stop entirely, turned up on edge apparently, as had the first, and appeared to take off with a burst of speed and then we saw something as if it were a white metal hurtling down turned the earth.

During the group was the general superintendent, job superintendent, and three workmen, all of whom are in the employ of A.R. Jowell & Sons of Salisbury, N.C., Building Contractors.

A UFO? oct.15
Yes Sir,
Says Ronald

Have the UFO's invaded
Rowan County?
Ronald Peeler, 13-year-old
eighth grader at Faith School,
is convinced.

He went out for what was to
be a pleasure ride on his horse,
Trigger, but his pleasure turned
to horror when something
"came down through the trees"
and chased him.

But whatever it was, Trigger
was faster.

Ronald called The Post Saturday night to report his discovery, but was still too excited to
talk. His father, Dwight Peeler
of Faith Road, said his son was
searched to go outside once he
reached home.

Young Ronald said he was
riding Trigger along St. Paul's
Church Road shortly before 6:30
p.m. when he saw the object
and heard its humming noise.
He said it went from the sky
into some trees, and when Trigger became excited the object
looked as if it was chasing
him.

The last he saw of it, however, was when he threw Trigger in fast speed and rounded
a curve in the road.

Ronald said the object was
as large as a two story house,
was a big yellow circle with a
smaller red circle and red dots
inside.

There were no other reports
of the incident.

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 Oct. 1966
    Day    Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

With reference to question 138 you will notice that one of the objects sighted and viewed somewhat diagonally up from where it was first sighted, with may set the tip of peeling with the center (220) since it seemed to question 136. I have observed (220) like a plane would turn a step bank. We to then on an edge, and the upper part does dark in color by comparison to what we had seen of the underside. It while was brilliant white. That this would probably have been a night sighting to 136 would probably have been yes.
