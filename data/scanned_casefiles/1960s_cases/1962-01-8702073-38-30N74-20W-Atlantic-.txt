Jamaica                     1/15/62
6:15 AM.  A bright object
rising in the NW horizon and
thought to be a satellite,
stopped at about 45° above
tic in the sky. The bright
object split into a number
of small pieces. The number
varied from three to five,
became bright, then dim-
mer at intervals. Duration
10 minutes - Similar obser-
vations in Akron were seen
on August 16, 1961, and in
Kent on May 3, 1961.

Evaluation of Source Reliability PROBABLY GOOD

Analysis and Conclusions: BLUE-GREEN OBJECTS THE BRIGHTNESS OF FIRST- AND MAGNITUDE SIRES. THE OBJECTS WERE JARING IN BRILLIANCE AND HAD EGO HALOS. THEY WERE FLYING TOGETHER IN VARIOUS RANDOM PATTERNS AT A MEDIUM TO HIGH ALTITUDE. CIRCLES FLEW ON VARIOUS COURSES, NNE THEN EAST- THEN SOUTHEAST- THEN SOUTH. WEATHER WAS CLOUDY.

THIS REPORT CONTAINS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ALLOW A VALID CONCLUSION. HOWEVER DUE TO THE DESCRIPTION, THE PROXIMITY TO BOTH THE AIR FORCE BASE, KINGLEY, AND THE NORFOLK NAVAL AIR STATION IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE AIRCRAFT.
