Elkhorn, Kentucky
Oct. 18, 1966 415.24

Dear Sirs:

I am writing this letter in relation
to a sighting which I witnessed on the
night of October 15, 1966 at the approx-
imately 8:15. It traveled through the
sky from the south(when first sighted)
and disappeared into the west-north-west.
It possessed the precise likeness of a star,
only moving. It seemed to travel at a
very slow rate of speed, and to travel
between the above mentioned 2 points
took at least 10 or 15 minutes. It glid-
ed through the air making no sound
at all. It made no motor sound after
hand. It looked like a silent, moving
star. There was no wind to hinder
sound waves. I witnessed this sighting
with my family, outside the small town
of Taylor Gin state of Kentucky.
I would appreciate if you would take the time to write me to-

Dear Mr. [redacted]

This replies to your letter of October 18, 1966 concerning the possibility of a satellite or other similar space debris being observed by yourself. At approximately 8:13 P.M., EST, ECHO II was at 40° North 96° West on a northerly heading. This satellite, with a stellar magnitude of approximately -1, would have been visible from your area.

It is possible that you observed this particular satellite. However, to make positive identification, would you please check the directions in which the object was travelling. Specifically, in what direction did the object appear to be heading?

This additional information would be most helpful in making a final evaluation on your sighting. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs;

In response to your letter of the 10th of December '66 which answered my first letter of the 18th of Oct.'66, I write once again write in reply to your request for further information pertaining to the object I witnessed on the 15th of Oct.

In your letter, you asked me to check the direction of the object. When first spotted (between 10 and 20 after the hour of sight) it was in the southeast. At first I paid little attention to it thinking one of the stars but then I noticed it slowly and silently move past the surrounding stars. It took almost or at least 100 15 minutes to cross the sky and disappear into the north-west, as I stated in my first letter. It made no sound at all and looked like a star, only moving. There were no high winds to obstruct sound waves. That is all the information I have except that on the 20th of Oct.'66 I saw a similar object following almost the same direction.

Thank you, Sincerely, Then

(Note: The top right of the document shows "Elkhorn, Wis." and the date "Dec. 13, 1966")
