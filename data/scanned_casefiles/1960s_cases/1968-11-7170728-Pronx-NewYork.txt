DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20330

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

November 25, 1968

Dear [redacted]

This replies to your letter postmarked November 21, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects or UFO's often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,
/s/
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

Dear Sir,

November 20, 1968 I
looked out my window at
about 9:30 - 10:00 o'clock. As
I looked around the sky, along
slightly yellow lights started up
then about 3 seconds later some
were spread out. They were about 14 mil.
They were shaped and
in the side of this.

[The document also includes a hand-drawn sketch with labels such as "UFO's", "Windows", "My House", and "Standing Here"]

Here is the text from the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
