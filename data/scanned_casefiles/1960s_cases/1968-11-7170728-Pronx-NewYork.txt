DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

November 25, 1968

Dear [REDACTED],

This replies to your letter dated November 23, 1968, in which you described seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the inclosed questionnaire and return it in the attached envelope, our technical people at the Project Blue Book Office will be able to investigate.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the Nearest Air Force Base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more complete and satisfactory explanation.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories or objects reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

/s/
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

The image appears to contain a sketch or drawing depicting a UFO sighting. The drawing shows a UFO-like object with details such as windows and other markings. There is also handwritten text describing the observation of the UFO.

Dear Sir,
On November 26, 1968 at 10:45, I looked out of my window and saw a strange object slowly crossing the sky, moving from east to west. It was approximately 200 ft in diameter and about 100 ft above the ground. It had a bright dome in the center and portholes around the circumference. I watched it for about 3 minutes until it disappeared over the horizon.
UFO? Looks like balloon or similar object in the sky.

Standing object
