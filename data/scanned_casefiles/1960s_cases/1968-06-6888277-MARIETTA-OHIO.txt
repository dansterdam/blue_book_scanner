11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object that was red with yellow lights. The observer indicated that the light went from the S5 to the North.

COMMENTS: In his original letter the observer stated that he first sighted the "object" coming out of the constellation Cetus (W at approximately az. 300 degrees), and that it disappeared by way of the big dipper (due North). This conflicts with info given in 6A of the AF Form 117.

Dear Sir:

I am going to tell about a U.F.O. I saw.
It was late at night when I saw a red light, it soon came
closer, it was a disk it was red with yellow lights on it. It
came out of the constellation Hercules. it then went to Urasa
Minor changed course and went to Ghetus, it soon flew out of
sight by way of the Big Dipper. The time I sighted it was 4:30

Do you have any explanation for this?

Very truly yours

Hercules NW Cg 300
Ursa minor N Cg 345
Ursa major N Cg 360

AFR 80-17(C1)

8a. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
