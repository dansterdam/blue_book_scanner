1. A report of a UFO sighting was received by the Security and Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah, at 0200Z hours, 17 May 1964.

2. On 23 May 1964 at 2215 hours, [redacted] Circle, Clearfield, Utah, reported to TSgt Glen T. Riches, Investigator, Operations Branch, Security & Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah, that her 12-year old son had observed an unidentified object pass over the Clearfield area in a southeasterly direction. Her son [redacted] and a neighbor boy were "sleeping out" in the back yard and prior to falling asleep were studying star constellations. While they were watching the constellations, they observed a triangular shaped constellation towards the northwest and one of the stars began moving and traveled southeast, disappearing over the Wasatch Mountains to the east.

3. On 24 May 1964, [redacted] 12 years old, (dependent son of [redacted] Circle, Utah) were interviewed and stated that at approximately 2030 to 2100 hours, 23 May 1964, they had slept out and prior to falling asleep they were watching a triangular shaped constellation of stars when the lower right corner star detached itself and traveled across the sky. It was the color and size of an ordinary star and appeared to be as high in the sky as stars are. It passed over the Wasatch Mountains approximately where Weber Canyon is and appeared to travel in an arc.

4. On 25 May 1964, personnel of Detachment 3, 24th Weather Squadron, Hill AFB, Utah, advised that between 1900 and 2200 hours, 23 May 1964, the sky was clear, with a few high scattered clouds and visibility of fifty miles.
