Astro(Jupiter)

At the time of the sighting Jupiter was on an azimuth of 80 degrees and at an elevation of 18 degrees

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted star like object in the eastern sky that appeared somewhat larger than a star. Object was different from stars in color and size. At one time the object looked like it was coming at the observers. The alleged UFO did not disappear during the observation. The object was white that changed more to a reddish color.

Description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Jupiter was rising in the eastern sky at the time of the observation. Although Sirius was in the southeastern sky at the time of sighting it is believed that the planet Jupiter is responsible for the sighting.
