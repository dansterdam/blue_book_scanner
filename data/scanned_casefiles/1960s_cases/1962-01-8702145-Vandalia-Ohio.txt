10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Witness opened curtains to a window and saw a trail being generated by some object which was descending at an arc. Trail was bright orange at the top, changed to pink, yellow, white, then gray. When object was level it appeared as a gray trail. For a while then separated from the trail. Object was described as a transport without wings and about 1/2 to 1 1/2 miles up without wings. Moved at approx speed of a landing transport.

11. COMMENTS
This was probably condensation trail formed by a WPAFB jet making a penetration trail. Upper trail was illuminated by the sun at the top portion. The lower part of the trail is probably black smoke from the engines. Upper trail was illuminated by the sun due to its altitude. For the sun was not yet up. Witness saw a/c in the semi-darkness and her imagination added to her description. A/c was probably involved in a non-standard penetration to be letting down NW of WPAFB.

Woman who called yesterday about flames in sky called again this morning.

"At 2000' flame streaked across sky. It was red-orange and made an arc, came toward earth northward, fell about 1000' further in an arc. When it did that, dark object that was in front of it was consumed in the flames. Then it fell another 500' earthward in that arc. Flames died out at about 1000' and a luminous white flame took over. Then when white flame died out at 500', gray object appeared and headed south and leveled off. It went down behind trees as if it were landing. Traveled at about speed of airliner (not a jet). About a mile and a half away from me. It appeared smaller than airliner at that distance. Sun had not risen at 7:45 when we saw it."

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: WITNESS OPENED CURTAINS TO A WINDOW AND SAW A TRAIL BEING GENERATED BY SOME OBJECT WHICH WAS DESCENDING IN AN ARC. THE TRAIL WAS BRIGHT ORANGE AT THE TOP CHANGED AS THE OBJECT CAME DOWN TO PINK, YELLOW, WHITE THEN GRAY. WHEN THE OBJECT LEVELED OFF IT GENERATED A GRAY TRAIL FOR AWHILE THEN SEPARATED FROM THE TRAIL. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS LIKE A TRANSLUCENT AUTOMOBILE WITH ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DC-6 AT 1-1½ MILES, BUT WITHOUT WINGS. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO BE MOVING AT CONSTANT SPEED. TRAILING AIRCRAFT.

CASE CATEGORY: PROBABLY AIRCRAFT

CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE CONDENSATION TRAIL FORMED BY A SWEPT JET MARKING A FLIGHT PATTERN WHICH IS ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN AT THE TOP PORTION. THE LOWER PART OF THE TRAIL IS PROBABLY BLACK SMOKE FROM THE ENGINES. THE UPPER TRAIL WAS RECEIVED WHILE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT YET UP. THE WITNESSES SAW INFORMATION ADDED TO THEIR RECOLLECTION. THE AIRCRAFT WAS PROBABLY INVOLVED IN SOME LETDOWN PROCEDURE.
