The image appears to be a document page with multiple black scribbled or redacted sections covering parts of the text.


- page 1 -

The document appears to be a transcript of a conversation between two people (labeled "ME" and "WIFE") discussing what seems to be a UFO or unusual aerial sighting. The page is titled "VISION BETWEEN SIGHTINGS TIDE EMPHASIZING CHANGES." The conversation is written in a dialogue format with various observations and comments about what they are seeing, including descriptions of a cloud, a trail, and changing atmospheric conditions. The text is handwritten and includes multiple exchanges describing the object's appearance, movement, and the surrounding environment. There's a boxed section in the middle describing a moon and evening star appearing in the darkening sky. The overall tone suggests they are describing an unusual aerial phenomenon.

[The rest of the document contains a dialogue between "ME" and "WIFE" describing what appears to be an unusual aerial phenomenon, with various observations and comments about its appearance, movement, and characteristics. The dialogue is structured in a conversational format with alternating comments from each person.]

At the bottom of the page, there is a note in a box that reads:
[ABOUT A MINUTE INTERRUPTION BY TREES,
THEN WE CAME INTO THE CLEAR AGAIN,
A FAINT MOON AND EVENING STAR WERE
SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE DARKENING SKY]

The text on this page is very faint and partially illegible. I can make out some fragments of text, but cannot confidently reproduce the full text. Some words and phrases are discernible, but many are too blurry to read with certainty. There is a black redaction/censorship mark on the right side of the document. The document appears to be a typewritten page with text that is significantly faded.

A POSSIBLE OCCURRENCE, BUT STILL PERTAINING THE SPOTTERS OF THE BODY WHILE UNDER YOUR FIRST WATCH.

THE FIRST PART IS TO FILE THIS, UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO GET IT A TEST WITH

THE SUMMER CLAIMS TO A USING TECH. WITH SOME ART OF ITS REAL DESTROYED THE ORIGIN

CHANGE IN CONFIGURATION APPEARED A WIDE FIRST PATTERN FIRST OF OVER THEN TO BREADSIDE - THEN ON EDGE AGAIN.

CONTINUED VARIATION IN THICKNESS OF CENTERS OF TRAIL, PLUS SHIFTING BEDS, PLUS COMPLEX AND CONCAVE ATTITUDES INDICATED MOTION BUT UNCORRELATED TO ANY ORBIT AIR CRAFT OR MISSILE THAT I HAVE WITNESSED HERE TO FORE.

WIDE SPREAD OF VAPOR WITH SHADOW EDGE LOCATED USED OF TURN OR MOVEMENT YET ON ALL CLASSES, PERHAPS DUE TO SIGHTINGS BETWEEN CLOUD MASS ALONG (WE WERE TRAVELING - FROM 60 TO 70 MPH) - AND OTHER TIME -- IN PART OVERCOME WITH MIGHT CARE -- THE OBJECT APPEARED STATIONARY.

THE FINALLY SUSTAINED PATTERN WITH ELECTRICAL FADING AFTER YEARS IS MINUTE OF VERY SLIGHT AND RECORDING CHANGES PATTERN AT ESTIMATED DISTANCE OF 10 TO 25 MILES ABOUT WHICH I CLOSE WITH 2 TO 4 MILES WITH NO APPARENT FADING OF 25 TO 40 MILES WITH NO APPARENT.

HARVEST HOUSE

THE TEMP FACTOR REMAINS A BAFFLING THING. (WILL HAVE TO FILL IN G.C.)

MOST CONFUSING TO ME WAS THE BROAD NEAR DEEP SPACE AS WE WATCHED AND THE WITH SMALL BRIGHT DOT ON THE LEAD OVER OF THE STRAIGHT - COURSE AND CONCAVE TRAILS.

THE OBJECT WAS PREDOMINATELY WHITE, EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT YELLOW URGE APPARENTLY FROM IN LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER GLOW IN THE WESTERN SKY - FIRST SIGHT (HERDING SOUTH) AT LEAST 10 OR 15 CLEAR BURNING ROAD DIDN'T SEEM TO PHASE IT MUCH - FROM 8-6-11 IT AT WIDE SPREAD - AND FINALLY AT 9 O'CLOCK FALLING AT 9 O'CLOCK (12 O'CLOCK STRAIGHT AHEAD)

I WAS ON AN EXPLORATORY TRIP TO DENTON - NORTH - LOADED CAMERA WITH STRIPES 2 FEET WIDE PEOPLE & WOULD HAVE TIME FOR ME TO STOP THIS DRIVE APPRECIATE HEARING FROM YOU OF ARRIVAL ETC. WOULD SEND SOME FILM WITH DETAILS.
