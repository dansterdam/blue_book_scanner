Aug 29, 64

Col. Goss

We are spoke this afternoon, returning
to what I saw this morning sitting at my writing
Saturday morning. I got home about 1:15
or 1:20 AM. I opened my apartment door, called
my dog and took her up to the roof to do her
duty. While waiting, I walked to the front of the
roof, looking across the playground toward
the 9th Precinct, which is on 5th & 5th. While
looking across the playground which extended
from 5th & 5th to 5th & 5th, I saw a flimsy
of a skinny object as though on its upward
surge with a kind of something like an
ordered fine shape. At the nose of the object
seemed to have wings or wing in order
to be able to cut through the air. (See figure it)
Behind the nose was like a work
belt with a square cut out. So not
far high, like a belt buckle. But later
very light, it may have been a door.

The rest of the object seemed to have
paper as standing. To the very end. But
this paper seemed to have been cut

Here is the OCR text from the document:

king these down the middle and attached to the body of the object. The front end of the piece seemed to let out on a 45° angle as though for air to pass through. There was no flame fire or smoke.

As I saw it all I seem to hear was a "Whoohhh" then lines or as you said a blur, as though in comics when any thing goes by at terrific speed going up and over the roof tops toward the west. After though I'd see a ghost. Col. Foss says I specially when my dog growled and barked the same way a long I remember that it came about 2 or 3 feet above the ground. It seemed as though it were made of chrome or nickel.

I hope there is nothing to it, but now days nothing is impossible.

Sincerely,
