SUBJECT: UFO Report                                                                1 April 1966

1. At 1940L on 29 March 1966, Major Thomas L. Ruddy, Base Operations Duty Officer, received a telephone call from the Air Police advising him that they had received a call from Wilmington, Delaware, concerning a UFO. At 1941L the call was transferred to Major Ruddy. The caller was Mr. [redacted], news director of radio station WIM who passed the following information to Major Ruddy:

a. A man in the southwest section of Wilmington had called the radio station to report that he, his wife and children had observed a single UFO from 1905 to 1925L. The object was described as being flat on the bottom and rounded on the top, similar to a half grapefruit. It was red, green and white in color and its movement was slowly southward, but going from East to West. As it moved it appeared to move side to side (North to South).

2. Mr. [redacted] also reported that he had received a second call at about 1930L with similar information except that the second observer was at Churchman's Road near Greater Wilmington Airport, New Castle, Delaware (South of Wilmington).

3. At 1955L the Air Police called Major Ruddy to report that their personnel had also seen a similar object.

4. Major Ruddy checked with TSgt Charles M. La Reau in the Control Tower and the Weather Observer who both stated that they had seen the object but it was a star.

5. Major Ruddy then went outside and observed the object. He believed it to be a planet but did not know which one. The Weather Observer checked and reported that it was Venus.

6. This planet is bright and due to the haze layer around it, could easily be mistaken for a moving object. Light infraction might give the illusion of various colors of the spectrum.

7. Major Ruddy called Mr. [redacted] at 2030 and unofficially reported to him the explanation he had arrived at.
