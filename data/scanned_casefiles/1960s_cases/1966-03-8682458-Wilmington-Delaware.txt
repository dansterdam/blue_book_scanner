SUBJECT: UFO Report

1. At 1940L on 29 March 1966, Major Thomas L. Ruddy, Base Operations Duty Officer, received a call from Wilmington, Delaware concerning a UFO. At 1941 the call was transferred to Major Ruddy. The caller was a man who had observed a single UFO in the southwest section of Wilmington.

2. A man in the southwest section of Wilmington had called the radio station to report that he, his wife and children had observed a single UFO. It was red, shaped like a half grapefruit, and rounded on the top, similar to a half grapefruit. It was red, green and white in color and its movement was slowly southward but going from East to West. As it moved it appeared to move from side to side.

3. At 1955L, the Air Police called Major Ruddy to report that their personnel had also seen a similar object.

4. Major Ruddy checked with TSgt Charles M. La Reau in the Control Tower and the Weather Observer who both stated that they had seen the object but it was a star.

5. Major Ruddy then went outside and observed the object. He believed it to be a planet but did not know which one. The Weather Observer checked and reported that it was Venus.

6. This planet is bright and due to the haze layer around it, could easily be mistaken for a moving object. Light refraction might give the illusion of movement.

7. Major Ruddy called Mr. ____ at 2030 and unofficially reported to him the explanation he had arrived at.
