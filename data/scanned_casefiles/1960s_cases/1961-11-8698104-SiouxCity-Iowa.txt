10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Obj. similar to bright, unknown shape w/no discernible features(no color, size) or central body. Obj. was sighted by younger persons who called attention to witness reporting the obj. Initial observation estimated 10° alt. Undefined changing flight w/no maneuvers for 15 min where it disappeared.

11. COMMENTS
At 24/0230, I crossed equator heading NW. It would have been over Sioux City area. At time of sighting, duration appears as a single light. Wind direction was S to N, a speed up to 10 mph. Vectors w/the most likely speed of wind at 15,000 ft. Noted a 20° deflection, steady speed of obj & direction of flight rule out the probability of a balloon. Astronomical & other bodies ruled out because of speed of sighting, characteristics of light.

12. CONCLUSIONS
☐ Was Balloon
☐ Probably Balloon
☐ Possibly Balloon
☐ Was Aircraft
☐ Probably Aircraft
☐ Possibly Aircraft
☐ Was Astronomical

23 November, 1961 Sioux City, Iowa. Time 24/0330Z

Report received from SCADS, Sioux City AB, Iowa on 200-2 Format 24 November.

Conf-object, similar to a-bright star, of unknown shape with no discernable features-no sound, tail, or exhaust observed moving Seotts. Observed by younger personsemble who called attention to the witness reporting the initial observation.

Initial observation consisted of no "green" elevation. Object maintained straight flight with no maneuvers for 15 minutes where it disappeared at an elevation somewhat lower than 40 degrees- (Object assumed to cross zenith.) Weather was clear with no visibility restrictions according to the observer. Local WX report was visibility 15, no cloud cover and ceiling unlimited. Wind information included. Witness repeated that object had no unusual features.

Possibly satellite sighting. ECHO I crossed the equator heading WEST at 24/0310.52 and would have been over Japan heading EAST at the time of the reported sighting. Duration of the sighting rules out aircraft although an a/c often appears as a single light. Wind direction was from the base and NW a/p speeds up to 70 knots with the most likely speed for upper air balloons at 40 knots from 280 degrees heading. Duration, steady speed of object, and direction of flight rule out the probability of a balloon sighting. Astronomical bodies ruled out because of speed or duration of sighting. Satellites generally near to or beyond visual range at time of sighting. Characteristics of mirages, reflections etc. are not present. Case listed as unidentified.
