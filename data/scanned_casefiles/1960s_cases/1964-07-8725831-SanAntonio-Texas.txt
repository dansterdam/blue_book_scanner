K. FLYING SAFETY OFFICER; PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
INDICATES THE UFO TO HAVE BEEN THE QUARTER MOON
NEAR MOONSET. THE AIR ALMANAC INDICATES THE MOON
WOULD HAVE BEEN CRESCENT SHAPED ON THIS DATE, SLI-
GHTLY ABOVE THE HORIZON, AND AT AN AZIMUTH OF 280
DEGREES AT THE TIME AND LOCATION OF SIGHTING. LOW
CLOUDS AND/OR GROUND OBJECTS PROBABLY CAUSED THE
APPARENT SPLITTING, DISAPPEARING, AND FRAGMENTING
OF THE UFO. THE APPARENT SHIFTING OF THE OBJECT
WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE VARYING DIRECTIONS
TAKEN BY THE OBSERVER WHILE DRIVING WHO AT NO TIME
STOPPED THE AUTO FOR OBSERVATION. THE OBSERVER
DISCLAIMS ANY CIVILIAN OR MILITARY TRAINING WHICH
WOULD MAKE HIM A SKILLED OBSERVER OF AERONAUTICAL
OR METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA. QUERIES TO MILITARY
