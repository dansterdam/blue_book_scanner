MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                                   11 October 1963

Subject: UFO Observations

On the afternoon of 11 October 1963 2d Lt Carmon Marano accepted a collect telephone call from phone number 788-3896 (Winston-Salem).

The person was not speaking distinctly; several times Lt Marano asked the person's name. The person was so indistinct that the name sounded like either a [illegible] or [illegible]. The person sounded like either a 12 year old boy or a woman with a squeaky voice. The person said they wanted to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object. The person said they wrote a letter a couple of days ago about sightings over Winston-Salem. The sightings have been occurring for the past three months. We see them almost every clear night. The Air Force won't investigate them because they say they don't have them on radar, but I've seen them with binoculars so they are there. The person said that the objects are usually going east and are visible for about fifteen minutes. The person was quite concerned that the Air Force wouldn't do something about it. Lt Marano kept asking for the person's name and where he was calling from so that we could investigate his sighting.

However, the person just mumbled and rattled on and did not give the desired information. The person kept saying, well, I have to go now, I have to go now. There was considerable noise in the background. The person was calling from a pay telephone. The noise was similar to that of what you would find in a school. He (or she) then said they had to go and hung up.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Subj: Alleged UFO Report, 12 or 13 October 1968

The FTD Command Post notified this office at approximately 0930 hours that an unidentified object had created an explosion, mushroom cloud and crater in the vicinity of Lakeland, Florida. The notification came from an AP press release #29 of the 13th. This office called McDill AFB, Florida, Lt Kline ext 372 and requested that he find out any available information on this. McDill had not received any reports, however, he would call Bartow Air Field and call us back. Lt Kline called the Aerial Phenomena Office back at 1025. He said there was no problem with the unidentified object. The explosion had been caused by dynamite and the AP was way off base. Lt Kline said he had contacted the Bartow Police Department and the Lakeland Ledger and they said the report was erroneous and the report had originated from a dynamite explosion.

Lt Marano had also called Orland AFB. They are a Navy Base and do not have a UFO investigating officer. Suggested that he call McCoy AFB. Lt Marano called McCoy AFB, Florida, Major Murphy. They did not have any reports.

AU 617/36-4215

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT: 19 October 1968, W. Quincy, Mass/1:30-2:30 AM ET
DATE: 22 November 1968
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.
CC: J.E. McDonald
USAF FTD (TDETR)

BACKGROUND:
Several days after the sighting, I received a letter informing me about it from a friend of mine who is acquainted with the witness. I assigned Investigator Eric Thorsos to conduct an interview with the witness. The attached report represents the results of his investigation.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
Although the sighted phenomena has some of the characteristics of a searchlight, the factors of weather condition, sighting time and duration, maneuvers and the associated blue and amber lights seem to rule this explanation out. The only bright astronomical object in that sector of the sky was Sirius but it was only a few degrees above the horizon and would not appear almost the angular size of a full moon. It would not appear to alternately change shape nor would it blink out upon the approach of a conventional aircraft.

The sighting does resemble those of glowing "cloud cigar" type reports. However, no gross or ingress of other objects was noted when the cigar would have been in a vertical mode unless the blue and amber lights were other objects and not connected to the larger object. I phoned the witness to re-question her on this point but her impression was that the object was round - "like a big button" and that it was revolving so that its face and edge were alternatively seen. She described the object as glowing the brightest and whitest white she had ever seen much brighter than a full moon.

The witness felt that the aircraft (which she also heard) that approached the object came close to it before it seemingly reacted


- page 21 -

Here is the text from the document:

N. QUINCY, MASS. - 10/19/68                                                 #68-57, CPG

[The text appears to continue from a previous page, starting mid-sentence]

...its presence by shutting itself off "like turning a light switch".
The social worker could see the configuration and perhaps was
unable to tell whether it was a multi-engine or single engine craft.
The aircraft kept on its course and did not deviate after the object
vanished. I have classified the object's configuration as a "glowing
cloud-cigar" but this is pure conjecture and is based upon the sketch
of the witness and comparison with similar reports.

My own impression of the witness, although based only on a telephone
call, would agree with that of Eric Thomas, our investigator - i.e.
she seems to be telling the truth and is not attempting a hoax.

( Two other reports originated from this area the following week. One
involved a large dark object which alternately displayed flashing
red then green lights along its side. It was reported to have been
joined by six smaller objects, each of which were surrounded by a
blue halo-like effect. The other sighting was another early morning
sighting of a glowing object. These cases came to light on a local
radio show but the witnesses are not known, some were teenagers, etc.
so no effort was made to investigate on the part of NICAP MASS SUBCOMM.
The newsclip service and police never produced reports of sightings
on 19 October 1968 so Report #68-57 is a one-witness report by an
untrained and elderly witness. By itself it is a statistic. The
report is submitted on a routine basis and because of the possibility
that the USAF received other reports, that the aircraft may have
been officially investigated, etc. If such were the case, this
report could be of value as supplementary evidence.)

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman

Dear Ray:

Please accept my apologies for the delay on this report. I am now past my general exams and ready to go on any future assignments.

It was at night when I visited with Mrs. McEachern. Consequently, I did not obtain much of a feeling for the layout of the surrounding area. Also, none of my maps show that region in detail. If you feel it important to have a detailed sketch of the area along the line-of-sight, I will obtain it right away.

I am at somewhat of a loss regarding what further checking could be done on a report such as this. If you have any ideas on this, or criticisms of what I have done, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Supplement to Report

The witness, Mrs. Grace McEachern, was not inclined to write lengthy statements in detail. The following information was obtained in conversation and belongs with her written report. The numbers refer to numbers on the main report.

5. The sky was clear, at least in vicinity of object.
7. The stars were visible, but the moon was not noticed.
9. The object first looked circular and solid white. Instead of being distinct, the outline of the object was somewhat diffuse; she used the analogy of a ball of cotton. It appeared brighter than the moon and a bit smaller in apparent (or angular) size. The appearance of the object went through the following phases:

[Diagram showing phases from solid white to blue light to amber light]

She estimated the period at about five minutes and assumed that the object was rotating. It continued in this manner for the hour in view. During this time, the position of the object shifted slightly, as shown below:

[Diagram showing house outline, TV antenna, and object's position at different times (1:30 AM and 2:30 AM)]


- page 27 -

11. She considered it much brighter than moon, but not as bright as the sun. It was not so bright one could not gaze at it, but getting close to it hint.

15. She first observed the object from inside the house, looking through a window and storm window. Then she went out on the porch (the plaza) and watched it from there. From this position, one is looking through no glass.

23. At about 2:50 AM she noticed an airplane off to the southeast, the strange light being approximately east. Then, just as she was looking at it, the light went out was lit had pressed a button. She stayed up until 3:00 AM trying to see it again, but saw no more.

26. She had no way to estimate distance to object.

27. The elevation was about 15-20° above horizon (my estimate).

29. The area is a residential section of West Quincy. Though she listed her address as Quincy, I am fairly certain that the area is actually West Quincy. She indicated the direction to the object as being east.

30. The nearest airport is about eight miles to the SSE. She knew of this and mentioned it.

Personal Comments

Mrs. [redacted] is 71 years old, appears to live alone, and gives the impression of an honest person. I become aware of no reason to doubt her word on this matter. Her previous feeling on the subject of UFO's was that she had heard of them and found the whole thing curious. She volunteered no ideas on the origin of UFO's in general or of the object she saw in particular.

Unfortunately, Mrs. [redacted] knew of no one else who saw the object. She did contemplating the police about it, but decided not to since she felt it would probably go away before they arrived leaving her somewhat embarrassed. Her only action in reporting sighting was to call (on the following Monday) in to a radio program that she often listens to.

Considering the possibility of a natural explanation, the moon does not appear to be a candidate. According to Information Please Almanac - 1968, p. 463, the new moon occurs at 5 PM EST on October 21. On October 19, then, the moon would be rising in the east about dawn and appearing like a small silver.

Dear [Redacted]:

The attached clipping reminded me that I was going to write you about the U.F.O. I saw a couple of weeks ago. The thing I saw was in the area general vicinity as what these boys saw—near your new abode. Maybe you ought to ask to file an "Open Channel."

My "sighting" was on Saturday night, Oct. 26th, the day the Russians sent up their most recent rendezvous vehicles. It was traveling from south to north, the same general direction of the Soviet satellites, but it was low and almost parallel to the horizon instead of almost overhead like those in other areas. It was on the same path as Galveston, and was moving much faster than the satellites we saw at Galveston, and took a wider "nose dive" just before it disappeared from view. It could have been an odd-ball glimpse of sunlight reflecting off a Russian satellite, but it was five hours after sunset (here) and was definitely above the horizon and was such that it would have to have been about 2,000 miles west of Houston at a height of over 500 miles, when I first saw it.

I was out on Westheimer near Fondren Road when I saw what I thought was a "shooting star" at first. It was just a streak of light that flashed in the sky and then disappeared. But it re-appeared on the same course and remained in sight for what I estimated to be 3 to 5 seconds. Then took a sudden nose-dive and a sharp turn, which is a total of about 30 degrees of azimuth in those 3-5 seconds, which is an unusually high speed. (A satellite in directly over-head at a high point of 100 miles would take about 10 seconds to cover the same angular distance, and from a distance of 2,000 miles, an orbiting satellite would take about 200 seconds to cover those 30 deg. of azimuth.)

At any rate, it was so unusual that I made notes of what I had seen as soon as I got home that night. The following is a verbatim copy of the notes I made that night:

"UFO" sighting - Sat. nite, 10/26/58 - 11:22 PM C.D.S.T.
West of Houston - seen from vicinity of Westheimer & Fondren.
Appeared as a dim spot of light traveling at high speed from 0 to 15 deg. to 10 deg. Above horizon. Slight slant towards north (say, 3 deg.). First appeared 10 deg. to 20 deg. W. of W. Disappeared definitely not-a-plane or orbiting space object. Covered about 30 deg. of azimuth in 3-5 secs. Suddenly moved toward a point lost to view behind airport. Definitely not an airplane or orbiting space object. Could have been a meteor or falling space debris, but no

as bright and sharp as a "shooting star". Slightly larger than a star seen by the naked eye, but not as bright as a bright star or planet. Dimmer--more like a flash-light reflecting off a fog bank. No "tail", but so fast it was almost just a streak. As fast as a "shooting star", but a long, low horizontal path with a sudden "nose-dive" on the end. In general vicinity of Ashe County Airport, Andrews. No planes in air at time. Fell towards Katy Highway and Addicks.

[Diagram with arrows and degrees]

Did not follow a parabolic (?) trajectory (like a falling object). Did not wobble or waver like an orbiting object. Followed a smooth path. Speed 60-100/sec.

The speed, height above the horizon, and trajectory seem to rule out a jet plane or satellite. A jet plane traveling 600 mph would have to have been only 1/2 a mile away at a height of about 500 feet and would have crossed within a couple of seconds at the speed and direction the "object" was headed. An orbiting satellite at a distance of 700 miles and a height of 120 miles would give the right height above the horizon and would appear as a point of light. This suggests a satellite at that height and distance would have been well within the earth's shadow but not like this.

The sharp change in the trajectory seems to rule out a meteor or falling space debris. No plane crashes, meteors, or falling space debris were reported in the newspapers. There was no noise or roar or sound connected with the "sighting".

There: The only thing left is a spot of light reflecting off a cloud or fog-bank. But it was a clear night and there was no fog! So--can you figure it out. Maybe there is "nothing" up there.

By a curious coincidence, I had breakfast with and who
next morning and showed me your new National Geographic book,
which he had marked at the passage about watching the satellites
at the night before. I was talking about Gaynesville - about what I had
seen the night before.

Then tonight, driving home through League City, I caught a
glimpse of two more "shooting stars". These were moving towards
me and went over the car (disappeared at the top of the windshield).
Just a quick flash and they were gone. But it was a cloudy and raining. Could have been a tiny snow-flake caught for an instant in the
headlights before it swept up and over the car, but still I'm beginning to wonder.

Seriously, if you know anyone who collects information
on "UFO" sightings, and would be interested in this type of information, you might forward this letter to them. I did see something
that seemed highly unusual to me and tried to be as accurate as possible in my estimates of speed, height, etc. I don't know what it
was, but it was something.

I'd like to take you and Toby to dinner some night when you
are free. I'll get in touch with you soon.

Yours,

P.S. Thanks for "Ordeal of Change". I've become a real fan. See you soon.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
The first object (sequential 1st, bottom) looked strange, however, witness first saw the first object (sequential 1st, light) moving rapidly towards him. He was then aware of a second object (sequential 11, light) in the sky moving rapidly towards him. His calls changed his way of thinking when he first saw it. Witness states that it took less than thirty seconds for it to travel from there to stop. Roughly 200 or less yards away, he began to feel that it was not watching a common object, than the white light went out and was sequential object moving in a similar light pattern. Witness states that the third sighting by him and his wife upheld his convictions even more.

A HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The first object, as was last out of sight behind a sandhill as the witness drove past Sandhill rd. The second object was lost to sight as he drove on, as described in question 9. The third object disappeared by vanishing as its light had been turned off.

The witness is employed as a mechanic. He has observed what appears to be an aircraft and landing patterns. This invariably increased his curiosity and fear of ridicule. He consented to talk to me only after a mutual friend of my own sincerely and seriousness made him more at ease after explaining the purpose of the investigation and the type of possible photographs. I was also generally accepted (as authentic) photographs and assured him that he was not the only person to see these phenomena.

[Top section with various checkboxes, mostly left blank]

Second Object: A bright spotlight twice the size of a military tactical fighter jet.

When the first object was sighted, the witness thinks he noticed a little bit of static on his car radio. However, he did not notice any static when the second object was sighted.

The area has been searched by this investigator, but not thoroughly. No ground evidence was found. Some investigation was made in the vicinity: a coyote, a cat, and an unidentified animal. The coyote and unidentified animal were tracked, their mouths being open with blackened tongues protruding. Their flesh and the ground around them showed signs of being scorched. They were discovered Nov. 16, 1968. The third animal was seen beyond recognition.

This sighting was brought to my attention by a friend of mine who knows the witness and has an interest in aerial phenomena as I do. The witness mentioned it to my friend, knowing that I was an operational person, however, when he mentioned it to others, he sat with ridicule (including his wife) until she can take the ridicule no longer.

The witness was on his way home from work when he saw the first object about 220 yards south of Tropicana Ave. just west of Sandhill Rd. At this time he did not pay too much attention to what he saw. Later he had just passed east of Jan. Hill Rd. he saw two second objects moving in a (unclear) white motion. The object was about three miles away at a 15 degree angle to the horizon and approximate direction of NE to NW. He was curious as he watched the object grow larger and in a period of 10 or 15 minutes it came closer. It was revealed in a straight line over Tropicana Ave. and stopped abruptly, without slowing down, and hovered about 10 or 15 feet over the desert 300 or 400 yards from his car. As stated elsewhere in this report, his bright light went out and the significant lights began to change. The object was stationary, the witness had been traveling east on Tropicana Ave. at about 15 mph when he saw the first object and slowed to 5 or 10 mph when he saw the object and stopped but kept the object in view until just before he crossed Wallis Blvd.

Here is the text from the document:

The aerial map on the preceding page shows the objects as they were in relation to each other. The sketch on this page shows the movements of the third object as seen from the witnesses home.

The accompanying polaroid photographs show the general areas of the sightings and are numbered and labeled and their remarks are as follows:

1. Shows area of sky in which third object was seen from in front of witnesses house.

2. Shows general area of first and second sightings as seen from the Boulder Bay, Red Arrow points to North end of area where the Vocational Technical Center is located and which appears to show a black arrow pointing approximately the location of the second object as is viewed over the ground.

3. In this and the following photographs, the Volkswagen can be used as a reference point; it is facing approximately 35°. The red arrow points to the Vocational Technical Center as is shown in photo #2. Notice this was it rests upon the road near Tropical Ave. South from Tropicana Ave. East of Sandhill Rd. Red arrow points to indicate area.

4. The view is Southwest. The road is Tropicana Ave. Merlin (east, the three small buildings plus in the background) and Sandhill Rd. beyond. The red arrow points to the sandhill, beyond which the first object was sighted and will be located the view on the Clear side of it. The second object was first sighted just this side of Sandhill Rd.

Although I have not devoted as much time to investigating this report as I would like to, I will submit this report now before it gets too cold.

Lake George, Colorado
October 30, 1968

To Whom it may concern:

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object

DATE: October 29, 1968     TIME: 1634 hours

LOCATION: Tarryvall District, 16 miles of Lake George, Park County, 100 feet from US Hwy O'Fallon Ranch.

WITNESS: F/Sgt., Air Force, Retired.

STATEMENT:

On Tuesday afternoon, October 29, I was making my return trip from Denver, driving on County Road #31, about five miles north of its junction with Hwy #40, over which it passes Beaver Creek, crosses Tarryall Flats, ascends to Tarryall Gulch, and on to Tarryall and Hwy #285. My ranch is situated west to east along the Tarryall Gulch in this valley.

I was at the time at the highest point on this section of the road. There of me were two minor descents, both on curves, where the road drops to the gulch level and where I turn left to reach my home. I first saw the object as I rounded the curve on the first of these two hills. It was less than a half mile straight ahead, and it was in a seemingly stationary position over and very close to a power line pole which is situated just a little beyond my turn-off lane.

This power line crosses the county road 100-200 feet beyond my lane and runs the length of the gulch parallel to my ranch. It is not the FAA facility which services the area, but a huge trans-state industrial complex which was completed in my area about a year ago. It is my impression that it is not yet in operation, but this is only a surmise on my part. The particular pole is the first one after crossing the county road and stands


- page 57 -

Here is the text from the document:

[Partial first line is cut off, starts with "...apurt and distance from both points."]

Inasmuch as I could see the pole clearly from my first sighting, position, the object which was about three miles or while at the pole length was very obvious. I had a few seconds of arriving whereas I had an excellent view of it from an elevated position where I seemed to be on a near level with it, if not somewhat higher. I lost the view for a few seconds as I rounded the curve to the second ascent.

At the top of the second hill I was afforded an even better view of the thing inasmuch as there was nothing between me and it but the low-lying terrain of the gulch. I immediately began braking and brought my car to a halt about 1/3 way down hill. I was by this time 1/4 mile from the object.

I checked the time, and it was exactly 4:32 p.m. I sat watching the object for exactly two minutes with my motor idling and held by foot brake. During this time I could discern no motion in or around it. Either it or I had changed positions enough that it now presented a slightly altered appearance which will be described in a later paragraph.

During this observation the object appeared oblivious to my presence.

I had long ago decided that if the opportunity ever presented itself to me to encounter one of these highly-publicized things, in the interest of science, I would make some attempt to signal it and, if possible, establish contact. I, therefore, turned on my lights flashing that they would not make much show in daylight.

I cannot say if this is what roused it, but it did then begin to move out, and it headed straight to as if making a pass. The object was not great, and I had a few seconds to observe it in a head-on position. (Again its appearance seemed altered.) To put it mildly, I was less than comfortable, nevertheless, probably because there was nothing better to do, I remained


- page 58 -

Subject and watched it until I was required to crouch down to see it through
a windshield. It passed out of view directly above my car at little more
than 100 feet level.

Just as I lost sight of it through the windshield, I became conscious
that my motor had quite. It was not a normal cross-out. The ignition key was
on, but there were no generator or oil lights showing. (On my car these
register on a stall.) The radio had been on, but is now dead. I could
no longer see the object and had no way of knowing, if it were not hovering
right over me. The most important thing to me at the moment seemed to be to
get my car running and get out of there. Not until later did I realize that
I might have caused a couple hundred feet. Instead, I relied on the emergency brake and kept cranking the ignition. Quite suddenly everything seemed
back on again. I then got out and took a look around, but the object had by
then disappeared—not particularly fast in that hilly and wooded area. It was
4:50 when I entered my house.

The sun sets early behind Mt. Badger in this area, and this had already
occurred, though it could hardly be called twilight. There was still early
daylight to have an unobstructed view of all landmarks. Daylight continued
long enough for me to relate the experience to my wife and for both of us to
return to the scene to check distance without the benefit of carlight.

INVESTIGATOR DATA

1. At first observation it looked like an inverted bowl with a definite outline of a smaller nose on top. The Farewell Mountains formed a
natural background for it, and it registered lower than the mountain tops.
By use of the point of reference at hand, I estimated its overall length
(or diameter) at 60-70 feet, or about three times the height of the pole.
Its height, including some, was roughly one-half of this. I looked so near
the pole that I was unable to define a 20° arc.


- page 59 -

Here is the text from the document:

[Partial first line is illegible]

(It should be remembered that I was seeing it from a higher elevation.)

Its visibility was clear against its background. Its outline was sharp against the sky of blue. Its outline was sharp against its background. Its one side was about 1/3 of its total size was likewise sharp. Yet, it and main body gave the appearance of roundness, but, if not, the dome was pointing east and west. There were no other protuberances visible, nor so signs of openings nor markings.

4. Its second point of viewing it was still in stationary position, but it looked higher above the pole—about as high again as the pole height, perhaps nearly 50 feet above ground. In this position I could see more of its under-belly and less of its dome. It was almost flat on bottom, but did reveal a minor bulge here. I still took it to be round and somewhat a hemisphere.

Its size was still consistent with my earlier observation. Of what I could see of the dome, it no longer appeared to be round and seemed to have shifted.

It appeared more elongated and angular on its further side. It now pointed north with a rounded end toward me which was south. It looked to be 6-8 feet in width, and I could not judge its length or height while seeing it from this position. The whole object now looked quite metallic and was more of a natural alumnus color with the bottom showing a shade or two lighter than the rest of the object. There were still no visible protuberances or details. I particularly looked for USAF insignia or markings or some kind, but none was noted. There were no lights either within or without, and no evidence of propulsion. Its bulk and seeming solidity indicates great weight, yet being motionless in air without any visible means of support.

5. When it moved toward me, its appearance again altered to a more elongated shape. This may have been because there appeared to be a projection to the front which was triangular (somewhat like the nose of a ship) and which was a different color and texture than the rest of the body. I cannot say


- page 60 -

Here is the OCR text from the document:

It was just after a mile or so down the road that it looked strange. Though not actually a strange object, its color was not consistent, but was nearly under of a reddish shade. I caught one quick glimpse of some kind of head of whitish light, but cannot say from where it originated.

The rest of the ship was still gray and appeared darker than when it was not moving. Unexplainably, I cannot describe the uni-versally, I do not seem to have seen it. This may be due to the fact that it was so strange and weird that my mind was unable to collect it to common form. It was completely alone, a fact I have no doubt of inasmuch as my car, now stopped, gave off no noise, and I ascertained that no wind was blowing, nor was there any other traffic on the road at this time. I think I experienced some physical reaction of a tingling vibration nature while it was near me, but it was not pronounced.

CONCLUSIONS:

I cannot say what this thing was, but I think I am prepared to state some of the things it was not: It was no conventional flying craft with which I am familiar, and I worked with planes until leaving the Air Force only five months ago. It was not a balloon. It was not an astronomical body. It was not an optical illusion caused by lights and shadows since there were neither at this time of day. It was not a cloud, nor ball lightning. While I cannot prove it, I am certain it was not a mirage or hallucination. It was a real and solid craft of some kind, capable of hovering in space or moving through space. Inasmuch as my car had been running properly, stopped completely dead, then ran again, this object certainly has a force capable of affecting an electric system.

The charts in this publication are a reproduction of the previous charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. The Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All the charts for one day are arranged in a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorologic Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously in Daily Weather Map and operational weather maps. Only a single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to the Distribution Unit, Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Science Services, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents data at 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by small black arrows. The locations of these centers at times & 12, and 18 hours preceding map time are indicated by arrows. Areas of precipitation are cross-hatched. The weather reports indicated by shading are only a fraction of those that are included in the original weather maps. Each of which the analyses are based. Occasionally, station data cannot be included in the published maps because of deck overlap.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500 millibar surface at 7:00 p.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown at continuous lines, and are labeled in feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES OCT. 7-13, 1968

The charts in this publication are
a continuation of the principal charts
of the Weekly Weather Bulletin of the
Daily Weather Map. They include the
Surface Weather Map, the 500 Millibar
Chart, the Upper Air and Soil Temperature Chart, and the Daily Precipitation
Chart. All of the charts for any day
are arranged on a single page or this put
into a booklet. They are copied from original weather maps prepared by the
National Weather Service. Weather
Bureau. The methods used on the
Surface Weather Map are those of the
number of grid points used in the analysis. The charts are the same as those
used in the Daily Weather Map.

The Surface Weather Map shows station data in analysis of 700, 500, and 200
millibar charts. Isobars and the low
pressure areas are indicated by
closed curved lines at intervals of 4
millibars. Fronts are shown by symbols 12, and 16 hours
preceding time. Precipitation is
small black marks. Areas of
greater precipitation are indicated
