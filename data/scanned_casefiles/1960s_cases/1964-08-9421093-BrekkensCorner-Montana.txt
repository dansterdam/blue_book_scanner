Initial sighting of object appearing to be a burning haystack. Crescent shaped becoming oblong. Orange, Plano colored.

Sighted to South. Remained in area until 0415 (over 1 hour) and observed object intermittently. Witnesses sure 12 object was not a star. (Object viewed later). This later object looked like a yard light but was much too high in sky. Object continued to move South.

Brecken's Corner, Montana
12 August 1964 Case

MINOR'S OWN LESS UNKNOWN FOR 1964

This was the setting moon seen through broken clouds from a moving car. I talked with Mr. [redacted] for a few minutes or so. If I did not sound like too accurate a report... he [redacted] made such statements as "had never seen the moon moving before". He took back the part about rising high, saying more than five degrees above the horizon, said it seemed like ten miles gray. It was crescent shaped and dark orange in color. Local time of moonset was 21:54.

He went out to look for it the next night and saw it again. He did not see the moon at the same time, but on the third night saw the moon about 20 degrees above the horizon, and quite far back about some point later than the previous night.

When asked whether he had come to any conclusion as to what it might have been after the passage of all these months, he said, "Well, it might have been the moon."

In fact, the moon was just setting but was not reported separately; the moon was between net and first quarter. That there were broken clouds, and that he could not back up the statement about the object rising makes me feel the moon identification is positive. Further, he was bodily mixed up on directions. First he said south and then southwest, but in was driving, also a curving road. He lacked any semblance of crisp accuracy in his answers. I don't think he knows whether the moon rises in the east or west! Very hazy on duration of sighting. The clinching point to me is that the moon, which was in the identical part of the sky, was not mentioned separately.

End of report.
