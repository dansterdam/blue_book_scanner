The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, discussing a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) at Kincheloe AFB in Michigan on September 14, 1967.

The text states:

14 Sept. 1967
Called Lt. Leaman at Kincheloe AFB Mich. 894 1451 ex 2332
He will find out:
1) If any scope photo's were made
2) Why no intercept action was taken
3) What radars actually picked up the targets that were called UFO's
4) If any one in the R-52 saw anything unusual, or if they were using any equipment that may effect radar.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: UFO on Radar
Lt. Leaman of Kincheio called Lt. Marano regarding the RADAR sightings. They did not scramble aircraft because they do not have the capability. This must come out of Hq 29th Air Division at Duluth Minnesota. Fed the information and why they didn't scramble Lt Leaman did not know.
The B-52 did not see anything and was not playing with the radar. The Sergeant who was on radar duty said that if the B-52 was playing with the radar he could have gotten on a different channel and not had the problem. He tried all channels and was getting the same results. The other radar, 753rd at SS Marie had one strobe at 0500Z, 250 deg tracking. SS Marie did not see anything on scope. Their scopes are monitored by Duluth. Duluth picked up the strobe. The name in Duluth is "Blue Bottle". The Minneapolis Center FAA at Farmington, Minn was negative. Only the 753rd picked up one strobe.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:
Subject: UFO Operation on Radar, Kincheloe, 11 Sep 67
At 1445, 14 Sep 67 Lt Stoecker Intelligence Division at Duluth, Minn, ext 756/755 spoke with Lt. Marano regarding the above sighting. There was no action taken since the visual was no more than 5 points for a short period of time and you couldn't have gotten something scrambled in that time. The sighting was on ground control approach radar. All that was observed was at ground level, by then nobody could have taken action. They didn't have anything on their SAGE radars. Lt. Marano asked them how they were on radar. Lt Stoecker said he could not give all the information on the radars but that they weren't too good on low altitude. Lt. Stoecker said they consider the direction and it could be anomalous propagation, but when it could be other causes. The man who reported the sighting is very experienced and would probably would know what it was if it was anomalous propagation. Lt. Stoecker said we could probably find out more by talking to Kincheloe. Lt. Stoecker said he would send a letter explaining what he had discussed over the phone. Lt. Stoecker said they had not gotten a report from 55 Marie's radar. He said he would check it out again and indicate it in his letter. He didn't seem to concerned that the sighting was anything unusual, especially since there was an inversion.

DULUTH, MINNESOTA 55814

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (507th Wing msg, 12 Sep 1967)

TO: FTD (TDDT-UF0)

1. In addition to the RAPCON (Radar Approach Control) sighting of SSgt Burris, two small boys from Kincheloe, on Sunday afternoon, 10 September, 1967. Their telephoned report was routed through Sault Ste. Marie AFS (a radar site about 20 miles from Kincheloe) to Lt. Lehman, the Information Officer in Kincheloe, who recorded the relevant information. This report was not forwarded to FTD because of a lack of evidence to substantiate it.

2. No interception of the objects was attempted because authority for a scramble must come from the Senior Director at 29th Air Division until the following day. Also the objects were not detected by any SAGE directed radar, only by the RAPCON unit, which has a range normally limited to about 40NM, or, at the most, 60NM. It is unlikely that any experienced Senior Director would order a scramble under these conditions.

3. There was no visual sighting of the objects, although Kincheloe control tower personnel were on duty at the time, and two of the objects passed over the base. If they were actual physical objects, they were probably at a very low altitude, since they were not detected by SAGE-directed radar.

4. In addition to SSgt Burris, the UFO's were also observed by A2C Rodney Roe and A2C Robert Carlson, both assigned to the RAPCON unit. The unit telephone extension is 3194.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
26 Sept. 1967
Called Capt. Tate about clarification of Kinchloe radar report.
He said that he had called Kinchloe and Lt. Leeuwam was to have done it.
Called Lt. Leeuwam at Kinchloe and asked why clarification was not sent. Lt. Leeuwam stated that when they were together the other day, they had discussed that it had seen two UFOs that night, but that there was a total of 17 UFOs tracked all night. Lt. Leeuwam said that there was a total of 17 UFOs tracked on the radar and understanding that this have arisen from the fact that he had said that there was no formation flying to speak of, and that the most that they had on radar at any one time was two, and that these two were not the same ones, but a succession, that these would be the ones both to say and Colorado, although he talked to Colorado the day before yesterday.

27 Sept. 1967
Called Capt. Kliperie at Base Operations. He told me that any aircraft moving at the speed of sound or above produces a continuous shock that is so strong that it could be heard at least 10 mile away. I asked him if an object moving at approximately 2,000 m.p.h. or less and seen a mile high would be expected to break the windows or houses over which it passed. He answered that it definitely would, in addition, it would be expected that it would cause considerable disturbance of birds, animals, and other things in its path. I asked if Flight Dynamics Lab. if it seemed inert details on sonic effects.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDPCS/V. D. Bryant/mjb/70441  15 Jan 68

SUBJECT: UFO Report, Kincheloe AFB, Michigan

TO: TDPT/UFO(Major Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to sighting of 17 UFO's by radar at Kincheloe AFB, Michigan.

2. There is no positive way to either prove or disprove the presence of the reported UFO's from the radar data. The fact that SAGE radars at other locations did not observe the objects tends to indicate a local situation. The objects of necessity had to come from outside the observed area at some time, and should have been observed then (by the SAGE radars), if they were real objects. If they were, that fact seems anomalous.

3. The obvious "excuse" or "explanation" for the sightings appears to be temperature inversion. The erratic courses taken by the "objects" and their wide variations in speed (150 to 2000 MPH), appear to be consistent with such a phenomenon. An increase in temperature with altitude, sufficient to cause anomalous propagation, is assumed, all point toward anomalous propagation due to temperature inversions.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an explanatory diagram and text related to atmospheric measurements. The diagram shows various lines and labels related to isobars, adiabats, and atmospheric sounding data. The text provides an explanation of the different components and measurements shown in the diagram, such as pressure surfaces, temperature, and saturated mixing ratio. At the bottom of the image, there is a "ROAB ANALYSIS" table with some numeric values, but no further details are provided about this table.

EXPLANATION
ISOBARS are straight, horizontal brown lines. The heights in feet of the pressure surfaces in the ICAO standard atmosphere are in parentheses (...)
below the pressure values on the left. 
ISOTHERMS (°C) are the straight, equidistant brown lines running diagonally upward from left to right.
DRY ADIABATS are the slightly curved brown lines that intersect the 1000 mb isobar at intervals of 2°C, and run diagonally upward from right to left.
SATURATED ADIABATS are the curved green lines that intersect the 1000 mb isobar at intervals of 2°C, diverging upward and tending to become parallel to the dry adiabats. Values appear in the upper part of the diagram (515 mb level).
SATURATED MIXING RATIO (in gm. per kg.) is represented by dashed green lines. The values appear at the bottom and middle of the diagram.
ICAO STANDARD ATMOSPHERE SOUNDING is indicated by a thick brown line.
The saturated adiabats and isoplets of saturation mixing ratio are computed by use of vapor pressure over a plane water surface at all temperatures.
APPROXIMATE VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE may be obtained from the formula Tv=T+0.608w where Tv is virtual temperature in °C, T is free air temperature in °C, and w is mixing ratio in grams/kilogram. For purposes of thickness computation, use the mean temperature of the layer for w.
Black dots along wind scale lines indicate the levels for which wind data are reported and plotted. The open circles indicate the mandatory pressure levels at which wind data are also entered.

SUBJECT: UFO Message of 12 Sep 67.

TO: FTD (TD-ET/UFO)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45438

1. Reference telcon of 26 September 1967.

2. To clarify my message of 12 Sep 67 on the UFOs that were picked up on Kincheloe AFB RAPCON:

a. Between the hours of 0342Z and 0501Z, a total of seven (7) unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were sighted by SSgt Michael Burns on the MPQ-14 radar at the RAPCON site here. Mr. Melvin message indicated (16) UFOs, but according to Sergeant Burns there were 17 (he must have skipped one when he was reporting the sightings to me over the telephone).

b. On two (2) instances there were two (2) UFOs on the scope at one time. First, at about 0412Z, (items c and f under B-3 in my message) one UFO at 230 degrees tracking 030 degrees for twenty miles and then changed its heading to 360 degrees. At the same time another UFO at 280 degrees tracking 100 degrees for 20 miles turned to 180 degrees where it met the other about 30 miles east of Kincheloe. The two then proceeded side by side on a eastbound course at 2000 mph.

c. The other instance of two UFOs on the scope at one time occurred at 0500z (items 6a and 6b in my message). These two UFOs did not fly together or intercept each other like the two UFOs did at 0412z. 

3. If there should be any other questions please do not hesitate to call.

1. Reference your telegram of 28 September 1967.
2. My original message should answer the majority of 
your questions.
	a. Time the UFOs were sighted? The times of the 
16 UFO sightings are listed in my message.
	b. Movements? These are all stated in my message.
	c. Time on scope? All targets were on the radar
scope for 20 to 60 seconds. The strength of these 
target returns were equivalent to a B-52. The blips on 
the scope was somewhat larger however.
	d. Speed? The speed of the UFO targets varied anywhere between 150 and 2000 mph.
	e. Noise? None. The UFOs were not visually observed.
3. Dr. James McDonald and Dr. John Ahrens of the University of Colorado are here at Kincheloe investigating the incident. They arrived Sunday night and will fly to Detroit later today. They may be able to answer most of your questions better than I.
