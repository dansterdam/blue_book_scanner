14 Sept. 1967

Called Lt. Leaman at Kinchelos AFB Mich.   284 1451 ex 2332

He will find out:

1) If any scope photo's were made
2) Why no intercept action was taken
3) What other radars in the area should have picked up the UFO's. What radars actually picked up the UFO's.
4) If any one in the B-52 saw anything unusual, or if they were using any equipment that may affect radar.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD                                     1000 hours, 14 Sep 67

Subject: UFO on Radar

Lt. Leaman of Kinchelo called Lt. Marano regarding the RADAR sightings.
They did not scramble aircraft because they do not have the capability.
This must come out of Hqs 29th Air Division at Duluth Minnesota. Fed
the information and why they didn't scramble Lt Leaman did not know.

The B-52 did not see anything and was not playing with the radar. The
Sergeant who was on radar duty said that if the B-52 was playing with
the radar he could have gotten on a different channel and not had the
problem. He tried all channels and was getting the same results. The
other radar, 753rd at SS Marie had one strobe at 0500Z, 250 deg
tracking. SS Marie did not see anything on scope. Their scopes are
monitored by Duluth. Duluth picked up the strobe. The name in Duluth
is "Blue Bottle". The Minneapolis Center FAA at Farmington, Minn
was negative. Only the 753rd picked up one strobe.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

Subject: UFO Observation on Radar, Kincheloe, 11 Sep 67

At 1445, 14 Sep 67 Lt Stoecker Intelligence Division at Duluth, Minn, ext 756/755 spoke with Lt. Marano regarding the above sighting. There was no action taken since the visual was no more than 5 paints for a short period of time and you couldn't have gotten something scrambled in that time. The sighting was on ground control approach radar. All that was observed was at ground level, by then nobody could have taken action. They didn't have anything on their SAGE _____ radars. Lt. Marano asked then how they were on radar. Lt. Stoecker said he could not give all the information on the radars but that they weren't too good on low altitude. Lt. Stoecker said they consider the direction and it could be anomalous propagation, but then it could be other causes. The man who reported the sighting is very experienced and would probably would know what it was if it was anomalous propagation.

Lt. Stoecker said we could probably find out more by talking to Kinchelos. Lt. Stoecker said he would send a letter explaining what he had discussed over the phone. Lt. Stoecker said they had not gotten a report from SS Marie's radar. He said he would check it out again and indicate it in his letter. He didn't seem to concerned that the sighting was anything unusual, especially since there was an inversion.

ATTN OF: 290IN

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (507th Wing msg, 12 Sep 1967)

TO: FTD (TEDT-UFO)

1. In addition to the RAPCON (Radar Approach Control) sighting of SSgt Burns, two small boys from Chio sighted a UFO not far from Kincheloe, on Sunday afternoon, 10 September, 1967. Their telephone report was routed through Sault Ste. Marie AFS (a radar site about 20 miles from Kincheloe) to Lt. Leamang the Information Officer at Kincheloe, who recorded all relevant information. This report was not forwarded to FTD due to a lack of evidence to substantiate it.

2. No interception of the objects was attempted because authority for a scramble must come from the Senior Director at 29th Air Division Headquarters. The sighting was not reported to 29th Air Division until the following day. Also the objects were not detected by any SAGE-tiled radars, only by the RAPCON unit, which has a range normally limited to about 40NM, or, at most, 60NM. It is unlikely that any experienced Senior Director would order a scramble under these conditions.

3. There was no visual sighting of the objects, although Kincheloe control tower personnel were on duty at the time, and two of the objects passed over the base. If they were actual physical objects, they were probably at a very low altitude, since they were not detected by SAGE-tiled radars.

4. In addition to SSgt Burns, the UFO's were also observed by A2C Rodney Roe and A2C Robert Carlson, both assigned to the RAPCON unit, the telephone extension is 3194.

5. SSgt Burns had no explanation for the sighting, and said he had never seen anything like it before. The equipment was checked for malfunction, and none was discovered. Twenty Ninth Air Division Weather personnel suggested that the temperature inversion might have caused anomalous propagation (AP) of the radar, causing false returns. Electronic Warfare personnel said interference from SAGE radars was unlikely.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

26 Sept. 1967

Called Capt. Tate about clarification of Kinchlos Radar report.
He said that he had called Kinchlos and Lt. Leaman was to have done it.

Called Lt. Leaman at Kinchlos and asked why clarification was not sent out. Lt. Leaman asked me what wasn't clear. I said that it had come down to me that there was only two UFOs on the radar not 17. Lt. Leaman said that there was a total of 17 UFOs on radar. Lt. Leaman said that the misunderstanding must have arisen from the fact that he had said that there was no 2gr formation rising to speak of, and that the most they had on radar at any one time was two, and that these two were side by side. He will send a message to clarify matter, both to us and Colorado, although he talked to Colorado the day before yesterday.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

27 Sept. 1967

Called Capt. Kiperis at Base Operations and asked him about sonic booms. He told me that any aircraft moving at the speed of sound or above produces a continuous shock train.

This shock wave is quite loud and he estimated that it could be heard at least 10 mile away. I asked him if an object moving at approx. 2,000 mi. per. hr. and less than a mile high would be expected to break the windows of houses over which it passed.

He answered that I definitely would. He suggested that I contact Flight Dynamics Lab. if I needed exact details on sonic booms.

SUBJECT: UFO Report, Kinchlee AFB, Michigan

TO: TDPT/UFO(Major Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to sighting of 17 UFO's by radar at Kinchlee AFB, Michigan.

2. There is no positive way to either prove or disprove the presence of the reported UFO's from the radar data. The fact that SAGE radars at other locations did not observe the objects tends to indicate a local situation. The objects of necessity had to come from outside the observed area at some time, and should have been observed then (by the SAGE radars), if they were in fact real objects.

3. The obvious "excuse" or "explanation" for the sightings appears to be temperature inversion. The erratic courses taken by the "objects", their wide variations in speed (150 to 2000 MPH), and the fact that no noise was heard, even at low altitudes, are assumed, all point toward anomalous propagation due to temperature inversions.

EXPLANATION

ISOBARS are straight, horizontal brown lines. The heights in feet of the pressure surfaces in the ICAO Standard atmosphere are in parentheses ( ) below the pressure values on the left.

ISOTHERMS (°C) are the straight, equidistant brown lines running diagonally upward from left to right.

DRY ADIABATS are the slightly curved brown lines that intersect the 1000 mb. isobar at intervals of 2°C, and run diagonally upward from right to left.

SATURATED ADIABATS are the curved green lines that intersect the 1000 mb. isobar at intervals of 2°C, diverging upward and tending to become parallel to the dry adiabats. Values appear in the upper part of the diagram (515 mb. level).

SATURATION MIXING RATIO (in gm. per kg.) is represented by dashed green lines. The values appear at the bottom and middle of the diagram.

ICAO STANDARD ATMOSPHERE SOUNDING is indicated by a thick brown line.

The saturated adiabats and isoplets of saturation mixing ratio are computed by use of vapor pressure over a plane water surface at all temperatures.

APPROXIMATE VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE may be obtained from the formula Tv = T + w/5 where Tv is virtual temperature in °C, T is free air temperature in °C, and w is mixing ratio in grams/kilogram. For purposes of thickness computation, use the mean temperature of the layer for T and use the mean mixing ratio of the layer for w.

Black dots along wind scale lines indicate the levels for which wind data are reported and plotted. The open circles ○ indicate the mandatory pressure levels at which wind data are also entered.

SUBJECT: UFO Message of 12 Sep 67.

TO:    FTD (TD-ET/UFO)
        Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45438

1.    Reference telecon of 26 September 1967.

2.    To clarify my message of 12 Sep 67 on the UFOs that were picked up on Kincheloe AFB RAPCON:

    a.    Between the hours of 034122 and 05012, a total of seventeen (17) Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) were sighted by SSgt Michael Burns on the MPN-14 radar at the RAPCON site here. My message only indicates sixteen (16) UFOs, but according to Sergeant Burns when he was reporting the series of sightings to me over the telephone on 12 Sep 67).

    b.    On two (2) instances there were two (2) UFOs on the scope at one time. First, at about 04152, (items c and f under B.3 in my message), one UFO at 230 degrees tracking 030 degrees for twenty miles and then changed its heading to 360 degrees. At the same time another UFO at 280 degrees tracking 100 degrees for 20 miles turned to 180 degrees where it met the other about 30 miles due west of Kincheloe. The two then proceeded side by side on a eastbound course at 2000 mph.

    c.    The other instance of two UFOs on the scope at one time occurred at 0500Z (items 6a and 6b in my message). These two UFOs did not fly together or intercept each other like the two UFOs did at 04152.

3.    If there should be any other questions please do not hesitate to call.

1. Reference your telephone call of 28 September 1967.

2. My original message should answer the majority of
your questions.

    a. Time the UFOs were sighted? The times of the
    16 UFO sightings are listed in my message.

    b. Movements? These are all stated in my message.

    c. Time on scope? All targets were on the radar
    scope for 20 to 60 seconds. The strength of these
    target returns were equivalent to a B-52. The slash on
    the scope was somewhat larger however.

    d. Speed? The speed of the UFO targets varied any-
    where between 150 and 2000 mph.

    e. Noise? None. The UFOs were not visually observed.

    f. Yes, this area is covered by SAGE.

3. Dr. Norman Levine and John Ahrens of the University of
Colorado are here at Kinchoe investigating the incident.
They arrived Sunday night and will fly to Duluth later
today. They may be able to answer most of your questions
better than I.
