500 Comment:

Time of sighting closely approximates scheduled appearance of Transit II. However, direction of travel doesn't fit. Checked with Patterson ops with negative results. No answer from 5th fighter style in WADD Flight Test Division. AACS states that B-52 came in from area country flight at approximate time of sighting and would have flown over Springfield.
