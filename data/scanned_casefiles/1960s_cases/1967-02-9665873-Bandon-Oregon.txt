35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

When I first saw it, it was like a giant sun hanging in the sky. It was low, perhaps 50 feet from me. I had not seen anything, and all of a sudden it was there. It apparently had come from behind the trees or the big building we use as a gym, dining room, kitchen, etc.

We first thought was that it was a trick of some sort, and I stopped and watched it, trying to figure out that it could be. It was not moving at that time. Suddenly it began to move down and started to come toward me. I began moving up the driveway to get back to my house, but when it stopped moving, I stopped also.

As I looked, I could see a vertical shape of some kind in the transparent structure above the light, and at that point I became frightened and urged my dog to hurry to the house with me.

At about that same time a number of students came rushing out of the west wing of the dormitory and started in the doorway, watching the object. Seeing them, I began crossing the lawn toward them, they were talking among themselves, very excitedly, and I could hear them saying, "Look at that thing! Gad, look at that 'thing'!" I called to them, but not very loudly, "What is it? What is it?" but they did not have any explanation.

I was thinking the same thing, and I was concerned, because I was afraid it would set fire to the building, and I remember saying, "Get off my roof! Get off my roof!"

The object hovered over the far end of the roof, began to settle as though it were going to land, hesitated, and then all of a sudden rose slightly and took off toward the trees above the shore of the lake. (There is a sharp drop to the lake level.)

We saw the light bobbing up and down a few times through the trees, and then it disappeared.

The students went back inside (this was after Paps and they had been in bed) and I took my log back inside. Then I went over to the dormitory to talk to the night watchman. He had not seen the object, because he had been trying to restore order and quiet in the dorm. He asked me whether it could have been a helicopter, and I said no. For there had been no noise. I asked him how the boys had become aware of it, and he said all he knew was that someone had shouted out.

When I got back to my room, I began to think over what I had seen. Then some boys in the west wing to the front door, where they had stood and watched, came over quite excitedly, because of the brilliant orange light, flying high and far out over the ocean.

So, it disappeared. A moment later the light appeared again, still higher and further out, and this time he saw it. It showed only momentarily and then it disappeared.

It appeared to me to be shaped something like a blender, wider at the top and tapering to the bottom. It did not look like a meteor or a home. Whatever it was, that I saw inside it could have been a person, and there was a distance of at least two or three feet between the top of it and the top of the lighted area. There was plenty of space around it, as there would be in the case of a person in a room.
