TIBLE WITH 2 PASSENGERS HAD JUST PASSED BY AND STOPPED BEYOND A SMALL HILL. NO SOONER HAD THE NOISE OF THE CAR'S ENGINE SUBSIDED THAN THE OBJECT BEGAN TO APPEAR FROM THE NW. MR. STATED THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER THESE PEOPLE WITNESSED THE PHENOMENON OR NOT. HE DOES THINK HOWEVER THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND SO UNUSUAL. HE WAS NO LIGHTS COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR. HOWEVER, HE WOULD HAVE APPROACHED THESE PEOPLE HAD HE NOTICED ANY ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SIGNAL THE OBJECT. DUE TO THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT CAUSED BY THE COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED SIGHTING AND THE EVEN MORE SURPRISING RESPONSE BY THE UFO, MR. WAS REALLY NOT SURE WHAT TO DO THOUGHTS RAN RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND. PERHAPSH DUE TO FEAR, HE FAILED TO CHECK WITH THE ONLY OTHER POSSIBLE KNOWN WITNESS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. AS HE RELATED DURING THE INTERVIEW, HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THESE PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY CAR MAY HAVE SEEN HIM SIGNALING THE UFO, PANICKED, AND WOULD HAVE BEATEN HIM SHOULD HE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO APPROACH THEM. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS, MR. STATED THAT IF THE 2 PERSONS IN THE NEARBY CAR HAD VIEWED THE OBJECT, THEY MUST HAVE REACTED VERY SIMILARLY TO HIMSELF.

DEFINED SITUATION, HE DEEMED IT BEST NOT TO APPROACH THE NEARBY CAR FOR FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES. 
MR. COULD SEE NO REASON WHY THE 2 PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE OBSERVED WHAT HE ALSO REPORTING. MR. EXPRESSED A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED, A FEELING OF COMMUNICATION SOMEWHAT LIKE MENTAL TELEPATHY, YET NOT QUITE THAT STRONG BECAUSE HE NEITHER EXPERIENCED NOR RECEIVED ANY MESSAGE BY BRAIN WAVE OR OTHERWISE FROM THE UFO. HE COMPARED THE EXPERIENCE TO A YOUNGSTER DOING SOMETHING WRONG IN THE BACKYARD OF A HOME WHO ALL OF A SUDDEN FEELS THAT HE IS BEING WATCHED. HE LIKEWISE COMPARED IT TO FEELING TO SOMETHING HE NEVER EXPERIENCED BUT WHICH HE COULD COMPREHEND BECAUSE IT HAD OCCURRED TO COMPANIONS OF HIS. THE EXPERIENCE TO WHICH HE REFERRED WAS THAT FEELING OF HAVING AN ANIMAL IN THE FOREST STARE AT HIM WHILE NO ONE ELSE WAS AROUND. YET THE ANIMAL COULDN'T BE FOUND ANYWHERE NO MATTER HOW HARD HE LOOKED. AS IS REPORTED BY MR. H**** OCCURRED ON SATURDAY 24 JUNE 1967. MR. M******* HAD BEEN OUT RIDING IN HIS VW AND HAD STOPPED TO LET HIS ST. BERNARD DOG OUT WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THIS FACT ACCOUNTS FOR THE STATIONARY GROUND OBSERVATION. MR.

Transcribing the text from the document:

TO THE LOW ALTITUDE AT WHICH THE UFO WAS PROCEEDING.

IN DESCRIBING THE UFO, MR. NOTED THAT THE OBJECT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WERE CIGAR-SHAPED AND TRAVELED WITH THE FRONT PORTION IN A LIFTED ATTITUDE (COMPARABLE TO AN A/C ON TAKE OFF AND LANDING.)

NARRATIVE (AS FIRST REPORTED, AND THE REVISED REPORT DURING THE SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEW):
A PHONE CALL WAS RECEIVED AT THE COMMAND POST, BERGSTROM AFB, AT APPROX 1230 HRS, SATURDAY 24 JUNE 1967. MR. REPORTED SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT AT 0312 1/2 HRS (CDST) - 24 JUNE 1967 (SATURDAY) WHILE IN THE VICINITY OF MANSFIELD DAM. HE SAID IT WAS A RAPID ANGULAR VELOCITY BLUE OBJECT TRAVELING IN AN ARC FROM UP TO ONE. FIRST, HE POINTED HIS SPOTLIGHT AT THE UFO AND FLASHED IT 10 TIMES AT WHICH TIME THE UFO STOPPED DEAD STILL FOR APPROXIMATELY 75 SECONDS (ORIGINAL REPORT READ 20-23 SECONDS). THEN THE UFO CONTINUED ON THE SAME FLIGHT PATH AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a questionnaire about a UFO sighting. There is no photograph included in this particular page.

OCR output:
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? [Response: It seemed to curlt off to the left as if going behind something, but it might have been lifted straight up as it faded from sight.]
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know [If you answered YES, then tell what.]
It moved behind some trees and then came out again.
16. Did the object move in front of anything at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know [If you answered YES, then tell what.]
It passed in front of some clouds.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None heard
b. Color White or Light gray
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? [Response: About 4 to 6 inches of a match head would have covered the object at arms length.]
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a form with various questions about a reported UFO sighting.

Transcribing the text from the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
Some person have seen the object several places where it appeared.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One) Yes No
31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) Yes No 
31.2 Please list their names and addresses:
Collie V. Richard, Wayne Richardson, Chas. Garrett, E.R. Garmon

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME LAST NAME First Name Middle Name
ADDRESS
TELEPHONE NUMBER 
Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
Lt. Foreman collected all such data for you. Again, in abbreviated form, I have studied extensively in various areas connected with rocket research, ballistics, computers, systems analysis, 1951 and 1952 I did extensive research work with various recording devices, etc and worked with numerous capable multi-state researchers. I have several multi-state technical papers on the performance of specific multi-stage rockets and subsequently was employed in bioenergetics. The Texas Junior Academy of Science also allowed me to lecture in the physical sciences. Also, I've studied a bit in astronomy and meteorology, and related areas. I have seen the Goodyear blimp many times, both at night and in daylight (having lived in Phoenix).

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? 24 hour first on 24 Sept. 1967 to Capt. Hanes, 6th Weather Wing, Austin, Texas

NOTE: It does not appear that any human faces are present in this image.

Text output from the document:

NOTE: It should be clearly established that sightings of such objects are quite rare and should be thoroughly investigated.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show the way they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

We saw only one object that was really strange (horrible). The only other object we saw was a satellite (moon) which was also unimaginable, but it was not nearly as impressive or concerning as the strange object. We could not identify the object, nor its purpose or origin, but it was clearly visible for around 5 to 10 minutes, and then disappeared instantly, rather than fading away.

Text from the document:

I took big spotlight off my car, started flashing light again. I soon realized (thot I could think of) that anyone might understand (something like this "sai") who I had flashed a few times (precise data in the account). I soon realized the object seemed to start illumination or its surface, various intensity - though I can't remember. Object hovered away, well, I don't remember how, but it is in my opinion it could not have been over 40 seconds, if my memory serves me). Then it continued on former course with a peculiar motion, indicaters for some moments, lost to sight.

NOTE: Approach of object from NW horizon apparently much faster (angular) than the rest of the course. In other words, it travelled generally "slower" after the first "hover".

I honestly doubt that the two fellows in the red car had anything to do with this incident - it is just difficult to imagine anyone there else so strangely. (Really - it probably scared the "dickens" out of them - it almost ID"ED with A FRIEND). (Never told but a few people certainly did not dare tell the news media about it, he said, "Well, I don't know what it was, but it SURE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF L.B.J. RANCH!" (A subjective guess, not knowing the distance.)

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: August 21, 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
Gentlemen: It is a real mystery to me why you state in your Aug. 21 letter that my sighting of Aug. 16th "falls within category C (insufficient information)". I should like to point out that this 16th report which Lt. Foreman took and, supposedly, submitted to you, contained far more definitive information (in view of the drawings I made for him) than could possibly be collected via your questionnaire.
Sincerely, I hope that, for the sake of the integrity of our fine nation's investigators and international affairs, you people in such an important position of public information and toward public opinion do not use the report(on Aug. 16) against me as a "final analysis" weighting toward conventional explanations of the case with a priori "weighting" toward conventional explanations does not seem to be in the best interests of the public. However, it should be clear to you that the reports of this nature (Aug. 16) require that a layman's reports should be given preference to data submitted here, for it was clearly fresh on my mind and therefore may prove to be more valuable in the final analysis,
NARRATIVE OF SIGHTING (Highly abbreviated): At approx 03:31 I stopped on Rte. 35 side (end) of Mansfield Dam to allow my Saint Bernard to evacuate his bowels. 03:12: my car illumination suddenly dimmed, solid-looking disc-white object very low above NE-SE, motionless, hovering. Approx. one minute. THEN same object veered off horizontally, gaining altitude, southward with a clear, steady light of medium intensity. As soon as I could see pretty well, my occupants arrived on scene. Seeing my big Saint Bernard, they proceeded to pet, then north of my position, I wondered why they would be so SUCH A DISTURBANCE, for with lights extinguished, then, when the strange object appeared on the horizon or to the other side of the hill, stopped the car again-out of my sight.
