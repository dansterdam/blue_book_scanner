(4) BY CALL
(5) 1/2
(6) NO EVIDENCE OF BLINKING OR PULSATION. IN RESPECT
TO SIGNAL (PI), OBJECT INSTANTLY STOPPED AND INCREASED ITS
BRILLIANCE THROUGH OPPOSITE REACTION. OCCURS LATER WHEN
AGAIN MOVING, OBJECT SLOWED DOWN AND ITS BRIGHTNESS BECAME
ONLY 1/5 OF THE ORIGINAL BRIGHTNESS.

THE BRIGHTNESS DURING THE ABRUPT STEP LASTS APPROXIMATELY
75 SECONDS. IN ANALOGY FOR THE OBJECT TO BECOME DISTANT
THE END CONTINUED UNTIL THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED.

(7) NONE VISIBLE. ALTHOUGH THE MOON PROVIDED ADEQUATE
LIGHTING, NO CONTROL AND VISIBLE TAIL, TRAIL, OR EXHAUST.

(8) [REDACTED] AT FIRST RECALLING THE INCIDENT,
BELIEVED THAT HE HEARD NO SOUND. HOWEVER, IN REVISING THE SIGHTING
AT A LATER DATE, HE RECALLED HEARING A VERY LOW PITCHED HUMMING
SOUND. HE HESITATED TO SAY THAT THIS SOUND EMANATED FROM THE OBJECT
BECAUSE OF HIS PROXIMITY TO THE MANSFIELD AREA, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT

HE HASN'T SPECIFICALLY NOTICED THIS HUMMING SOUND FROM THE AREA BEFORE
THE INCIDENT.

(9) THE OBJECT SEEMED TO HAVE RIGID FEATURES AND
POSSIBLY ITSELF AS A KIND OF GREAT STABILITY... OPINION ON
ROTATION WAS DISREGARDED. HE BELIEVED THE OBJECT DESCRIBED
TO HIM WAS RELATIVELY STATIONARY OF THE AERODYNE EFFECT, I.E., IT
COULD RESPOND TO THE SIGNAL (PI) QUICKLY. IT WOULD STOP, IT WOULD

THE OBJECT STOPPED SPONTANEOUSLY IN RESPONSE TO THE SIGNAL. (?) FOR
A WHILE APPROXIMATING 75 SECONDS. THEN IT CONTINUED ALONG THE
ORIGINAL FLIGHT PATH AT THE ORIGINAL SPEED NOTED (HIGH VELOCITY).

THE ONLY THING MR. [REDACTED] NOTED WAS THAT THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS
WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL I.E. ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT
WAS TILTED APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES RELATIVE TO ITS TRAVEL, IT
TRAVELED ALONG A SMOOTH ARCHED FLIGHT PATH (NO TURNS OR MANEUVERS
NOTED).

BANKS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. MR [REDACTED] WAS ALONE
WITH HIS DOG WHEN MAKING THE OBSERVATION. HOWEVER, ARED CONVER-
TIBLE WITH 2 PASSENGERS HAD JUST PASSED BY AND STOPPED BEYOND A SMALL
HILL. NO SOONER HAD THE NOISE OF THE CAR'S ENGINE SUBSIDED THAN THE
OBJECT BEGAN TO APPEAR FROM THE NW. MR [REDACTED] STATED THAT HE DOEN'T
KNOW WHETHER THESE PEOPLE WITNESSED THE PHENOMENON OR NOT. HE DOES THINK
HOWEVER THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND
SO UNUSUAL. HE WAS NO LIGHTS COMING FROM THE DIRECT ION OF THE CAR.
HOWEVER, HE WOULD HAVE APPROACHED THESE PEOPLE HAD HE NOTICED ANY
ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SIGNAL THE OBJECT. DUE TO THE EMOTIONAL
IMPACT CAUSED BY THE COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED SIGHTING AND THE EVEN MORE
SURPRISING RESPONSE BY THE UFO, MR [REDACTED] WAS REALLY NOT SURE
WHAT TO DO THOUGHTS RAN RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND. PERHAPS DUE TO
FEAR, HE FAILED TO CHECK WITH THE ONLY OTHER POSSIBLE KNOWN WITNESS
IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. AS HE RELATED DURING THE
INTERVIEW, HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THESE PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY CAR MAY
HAVE SEEN HIM SIGNALING THE UFO, PANICKED, AND WOULD HAVE BEATEN HIM
SHOULD HE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO APPROACH THEM. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS,
MR. [REDACTED] STATED THAT IF THE 2 PERSONS IN THE NEARBY CAR HAD VIEWED

DEFINED SITUATION, HE DEEMED IT BEST NOT TO APPROACH THE NEARBY CAR FOR FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

MR. COULD SEE NO REASON WHY THE 2 PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE OBSERVED WHAT HE WAS NOW REPORTING. MR. EXPRESSED A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED, A FEELING OF COMMUNICATION SOMEWHAT LIKE MENTAL TELEPATHY, YET NOT QUITE THAT STRONG BECAUSE HE NEITHER EXPERIENCED NOR RECEIVED ANY MESSAGE BY BRAIN WAVE OR OTHERWISE FROM THE UFO. HE COMPARED THE EXPERIENCE TO A YOUNGSTER DOING SOMETHING WRONG IN THE BACKYARD OF A HOME WHO ALL OF A SUDDEN FELT THAT HE WAS BEING WATCHED. HE LIKEWISE COMPARED THE FEELING TO SOMETHING HE NEVER EXPERIENCED BUT WHICH HE COULD COMPREHEND BECAUSE IT HAD OCCURRED TO COMPANIONS OF HIS. THE EXPERIENCE TO WHICH HE REFERRED WAS THAT FEELING OF HAVING AN ANIMAL IN THE FOREST STARE AT HIM WHILE NO ONE ELSE WAS AROUND. YET THE ANIMAL COULDN'T BE FOUND ANYWHERE NO MATTER HOW HARD HE LOOKED. THESE ARE THE FACTS AS REPORTED BY MR. AS THEY OCCURRED ON SATURDAY 24 JUNE 1967. MR. HAD BEEN OUT RIDING IN HIS VW AND HAD STOPPED TO LET HIS ST. BERNARD DOG OUT WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THIS FACT ACCOUNTS FOR THE STATIONARY GROUND OBSERVANCE. MR. CAR WAS NEARBY WHEN HE REACHED INTO IT FOR HIS SPOTLIGHT, AN EVEREADY BRAND, 6 VOLT

TO THE LOW ALTITUDE AT WHICH THE UFO WAS PROCEEDING.

IN DESCRIBING THE UFO, MR. NOTED THAT THE OBJECT

LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WERE CIGAR-SHAPED AND TRAVELED WITH THE FRONT
PORTION IN A LIFTED ATTITUDE (COMPARABLE TO AN A/C ON TAKE OFF AND
LANDING.)

NARRATIVE (AS FIRST REPORTED, AND THE REVISED REPORT DURING THE
SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEW):

A PHONE CALL WAS RECEIVED AT THE COMMAND POST, BERGSTROM AFB, AT
APPROX 1230 HRS, SATURDAY 24 JUNE 1967, MR. REPORTED
SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT AT 0312 1/2 HRS (CDT) -
24 JUNE 1967 (SATURDAY) WHILE IN THE VICINITY OF MANSFIELD DAM. HE
SAID IT WAS A RAPID ANGULAR VELOCITY BLUE OBJECT TRAVELING IN AN ARC
FROM NW TO NE. FIRST, HE POINTED HIS SPOILIGHT AT THE UFO AND
FLASHED IT 10 TIMES AT WHICH TIME THE UFO STOPPED DEAD STILL FOR
APPROXIMATELY 75 SECONDS (ORIGINAL REPORT READ 20-25 SECONDS). THEN

THE UFO CONTINUED ON THE SAME FLIGHT PATH AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY

"How" is an emphases light. It appeared to cut off its light (at the surface) (moved) in changes to merge in light (-) light signal & 100 degrees faded away if it is visible where (moved)

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: sit fixed point on course (visible course) it was descending from view before it was hidden (see attached statement moving in pretty much same direction)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: (self) moved essentially instantaneously self-slid within plane, moved within those heights)

a. Sound such as: Heard distance like hum, but this may have been too so. b. Smell: c. Defination: Attraction rather than hum was some hum was quiet

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
self this is needed, it is quite about precisely at the point you have it. I know frequency and he slowed up as it was very very thorough. It was between 12 and 15 minutes of the (continue with moon)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Lt. Foreman collected all such data for you. Again, in abbreviated form: Although I am an artist and student by profession, I have studied extensively in various areas connected with rocket research, orbital "mechanics", etc. In '54 & '55 I did extensive research with self-defense thrust testers, monitoring devices, etc and worked with numerous sizeable multi-stage rockets.

Wrote several long, mathematical papers on the performance of specific multi-stage rockets and, eventually, was awarded (my senior year in high school) the Texas Junior Academy of Science's highest award (HIGHSCHOOL) for '55-'56 for research in the physical sciences.

Also, I've studied a bit in astronomy, meteoritics, and related areas. I have seen the Goodyear blimps many times, both at night and in daylight (having lived in Phoenix) and what I saw WAS NOT A BLIMP.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? 24th (Sat) June 1967
    Day    Month    Year

Here is the text from the document:

NOTE: 14 double - checked description and in no way completed information.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

If saw only one object that was really strange (describe herein)... the only other object I saw was a satellite (much invisible or dimmer than "A"). I just little attention to it was not impressive when faintly "near" (angular) 90° to B.D. Satellite passed, I think, generally, S.W. to N.E.

I took big spotlight (took description of same) from my car, started flashing (only code I could think of that anyone might understand (mathematically "3,4,1")) When I had flashed "..." a few times (precise data in account), the object STOPPED DEAD STILL and the illumination of its surface vanished for appx. 1.5 seconds (check accuracy). Object hovered maybe well, I don't remember, but it is in Foreman's account (was for what seemed a good while, more than 40 seconds, IF my memory serves me). Then I continued on course.

Now watched object via binoculars. That view (had eye-REDACTED) pieces at special indicators for instant adjustment to my eyes) I confirmed and clarified my impression of object as seen via unaided eye. --see illustrations.

NEARBY, SOME (may have) eclipsed star in Ursa Major, & started flashing light code again. As it continued on its course, it slowed, as if in response, illumination on object's surface dimmed very noticeably, then brightened, when object resumed its former angular velocity. Soon it was obscured by low, broken cloud cover approaching from generally south. [03:22--Bergstrom time may show cover area few minutes earlier, due to its location (E-SE of me)]

Appx. positions on course (from my location) of (a), the hover and light cut-off, and (b), the slowing and dimming of light:

[A hand-drawn diagram is present with annotations]

NOTE: Approach of object from NW horizon seemed much faster (angularly) than the rest of the course. In other words, it travelled generally "slower" after I began my signalling--or at least after the first "hover".

I, honestly, doubt that the two fellows in the red car had anything to do with the "UFO"--but it is odd that they came when they did to the site, flashed their lights, and behaved so strangely. (Really, it probably scared the "dickens" out of them--it almost DID THAT FOR ME AT FIRST, especially when it seemed to respond to my signal.)

Later, I joked with a friend (never told the news media) about it. I said, when he asked what I thought it was, "Well, I don't know what it was, but it SURE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF L.B.J.'S RANCH!" (A subjective guess, not knowing the distance.)

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    July 8     0     1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Gentlemen: It is a real mystery to me why you state in your Aug. 21 missive "The information which we have received is not sufficient for scientific evaluation." In consideration of the fact that the very thorough report which Lt. Foreman took and, supposedly, submitted to you, contains FAR MORE definitive information (in view of the drawings I made for him) than could possibly be elicited via your questionnaire.

Of course, I appreciate and consider your interest in writing information that is accurate and definitely as possible; however, your inability to see that Lt. Foreman's meticulous and commendable report on my observation is of considerably more value than the somewhat cursory information available to you through an observer's completion of this questionnaire, leads me to believe, or at least to suppose, that the accusations of NEGLIGENCE heaped upon you (as individual officers in Bluebook and collectively) by some independent investigators in recent years may not be entirely unfounded.

Sincerely, I hope that, for the sake of the integrity of our fine nation's internal and international affairs, you people--in such an important position of public information and toward public opinion, do not use the term (see your August 21 letter) "scientific evaluation" as synonyms with "scientific deviation" of the case with a priori 'weighting' toward conventional explanation.'

I should like to offer you the benefit of the doubt, however. It if for this reason that I submit this form, FTD 164, completed to the best of my present memory. (All data in Foreman's reports should be given preference to data submitted here, for it was collected while the observation was fresh on my mind.)

NARRATIVE OF SIGHTING (Highly abbreviated): At appx. 03:11 (A.M.) I stopped on pavement on N. side (end) of Mansfield Dam to allow my Saint Bernard to evacuate his bowels. 03:12½ my attention was caught by strange, elongated, solid-looking blue-white object, very low above NW (geopolar) horiz. Appx. one minute prior, small red, converticle spacecraft (Sunbeam? 1½?) with two fairly short, young, blond-looking (moonlit was bright, I could see pretty well) male occupants arrived on scene. Seeing my big Saint Bernard, they proceeded west, then north of my position, maybe 250 feet, then stopped. I wondered why they would be at such a place that time of night. They parked car with lights tilted UP THE HILL and FLASHED THEIR BEAMS SEVERAL TIMES. It was only a short time, then, when the strange object appeared on the NW horizon. Occupants of red auto pulled over to the other side of the hill, stopped the car again-out of my sight.
