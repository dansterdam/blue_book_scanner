Number of observers: Three. My wife, her sister, and I.

Objects when first sighted appeared as in Fig.1. Looked like tiny thin stars, first burst with no expansion to the perfect circle it presented. Blue star-like objects remained stationary among themselves as entire swarm moved due south.

10 to 15 seconds after first sighting they began swarming like bees, resolving into two undulating V formations as in Figure 2. After briefly holding, this formation the V formations melted together in to one large V as in Figure 3.

Direction of their travel: Due south.
Total viewing time from start to finish estimated at 30 to 45 seconds.

I called a friend Mr. Jim Ward at Sky Harbor Control Tower. He did not see this but he did call F.A.A. Radar Center at Albuquerque New Mexico by direct line. They reported sighting nothing.

My qualifications as an observer:
