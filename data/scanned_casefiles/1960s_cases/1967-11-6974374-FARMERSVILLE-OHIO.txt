SUBJECT: Request for Comments on UFO Observations

TO:   Dr. J. Allen Hynek

1. Reference the attached report from [redacted] of Farmersville, Ohio, on his unidentified observation of 5 November 1967.

2. The sighting was made on 29-30 October 1967 which was evaluated as possible aircraft. The witness has not provided additional information on his sighting of 5 November. However, we would appreciate your written comments as to the possibility of Mr. [redacted] having the moon for his latest observation.

Farmersville at 20:21 EST. Since the sighting time is given as 20:00, duration 5 min., and the moon had a southern declination--and the fact that he didn't mention the moon when the nearly quarter moon was plainly there, makes it very suspicious. The moon was too cubical, 'No moon', of course, and not 20 degrees in elevation----more like 4-8 degrees, but that is normal exaggeration. The observer also mentioned some farther south objects, but I do not think this was serious. He also said he thought it might be the moon, but the "moon wouldn't be visible". Well, it was.

From a Letter
by J.A. Hynek
27 Jan 1968

CASE: 5 Nov. 1967 Farmersville, Ohio                                                    corrections

Clearly a case of the moon. When one makes six-or-more for the longitude of Farmersville west of the 75 th meridian, and corrects for the difference from the meridian of Greenwich, one comes out to moonset for Farmersville at 20:21 SST. Since the sighting is a 6 to 7 even 20,000, duration 5 min., and the moon near a southwest declination,--and the fact that he didn't mention the moon when the nearly quarter moon was plainly there, makes it very "icky". That the moon was the culprit. Of course, was not 20 degrees in elevation----more like 4-8 degs, but that is normal exaggeration. The moon should also know somewhat farther south than his observations indicate his objectives, but I do not think was is serious. Also, he said he thought it right to the moon, but the moon wouldn't be visible. Well, it was.
