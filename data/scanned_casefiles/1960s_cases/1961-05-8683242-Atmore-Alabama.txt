REPLY TO
ATTN OF: MTW

19 May 1961

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Atmore, Alabama

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Two unidentified flying objects are reported by Mr. [redacted] of Atmore, Alabama, by telephone on 13 May 1961. The undersigned personally telephoned to Mr. [redacted] to determine the facts surrounding the occurrence.

2. Mr. [redacted] states that at 0010 CST (0610 Z), 13 May 1961, a rather brilliant white or bluish-white light passed over Atmore, Alabama in a direction approximately West to East. Speed and altitude were unknown and unestimated. He also reported that at approximately 0230 CST (0830 Z), 13 May 1961, a similar light again passed over the vicinity of Atmore, Alabama with a direction approximately from Northwest to Southeast. Altitude and speed unknown and unestimated. Mr. [redacted] states that these lights looked very much like his observance of Echo I which he saw several times a few months ago. Mr. [redacted] is a Senior in high school, works at the Atmore, Alabama Radio Station WATM and appears to be increasingly interested in scientific phenomena and his statements appear to be accurate. These two lights were observed by witnesses in the presence of Mr. [redacted].

3. It is the conclusion of the undersigned investigating officer that these rather brilliant white lights were the white lights under the fuselage of either a commercial jet aircraft or a military jet aircraft. The unclassified has observed that the white light under the fuselage of a jet aircraft can be seen at a considerably farther distance than the red and green flashing navigation lights. This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that Atmore, Alabama is 10 nautical miles south of the Northwest-Southeast jet airway 7500W used by military aircraft only.

4. Mr. [redacted] was advised by the undersigned to report any future occurrences with as much detailed information as possible. It is concluded that no further action need be taken on this report.
