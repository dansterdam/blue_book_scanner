Ogallala Youths Say They Were 'Chased' by Unidentified Object

Two Ogallala youths reported seeing a lighted unidentified flying object fall from the sky about the same time that residents of northwest and north-central Nebraska and southwestern South Dakota reported seeing a bright object crossing the sky.

The two boys, Danny Uptegrove, 16, and George Looney, 17, declared the object followed their car at speeds above 25 in an hour. They fled from the sky between 7:30 and 8 p.m. Thursday.

Beckman, an expert fail about 7:15 p.m. said he was an explosionist 6 to 5 minutes "in the valley," in the words of Irwin Beckman, a former IF the area.

George said in a telephone conversation that Danny first sighted the object. The two had then gone to see where it had fallen, about 1/2 mile out of town.

"We were about a block from the object, it didn't move, and then it started toward us. We left when it got closer, after we got the car started. We had the throttle pulled all the way out, and it wouldn't run," George said.

The object was about three-fourths block long, and about a street's width wide, and it was flat, just like a street light shining on the ground. "We thought maybe it was something above it, and there was just a plain white light, which was dim around the edges and flat on the ground.

"We thought maybe it was going to move toward us. We were pretty scared, so I don't remember much else and don't remember seeing or feeling anything."

The two boys said they watched the object when they first approached, and it came nearer once it started moving.

"We've had a lot of people laugh at us when we told them about it, and a lot of the people asked us questions about it to be sure we saw it moving, but we saw it move, I'm sure of it," Looney said.

Additional reporting of objects in the area included a key came from a Federal Aviation Agency employe in Cheyenne, who said a appeared right to earth about 7 his vantage point in the area.

A tourist reported seeing a meteor fall to earth about 5 p.m. near Kilgore, SD, in southwestern South Dakota, leaving a trail of yellow-red sparks and fire.

Officials of the South Dakota State School of Mines are investigating.

A Bureau said it was unable to determine whether the ball had been a meteor, fire, or pieces of meteors.

...ported that they saw a lighted UFO call from the sky, and that the object followed their car at, speeds above 25 mph. The sighting, plus an explosion located near car, was confirmed by many people over a wide area, but the story told by these two young men was that they approached to within a short distance of the object, which was on the ground, and then got out of their car. As they did so, it started moving toward them. The UFO was about half or 3/8 of a block long and about a first's width wide, according to the boys - it was plain white, glowing, and seemed to be round and flat on the ground. It did not seem to have any windows.

Strange Lights In S.D.' Neb.

On Thursday, 18 October, residents of Rapid City, S. D., as well as employees of The FAA in Cheyenne, Wyoming, reported a huge, bright meteor in western Nebraska several reports were made to authorities concerning a strange bright object in the sky. Highway Patrol officers at Scottsbluff reported a motorist said what he thought was a fragment of a meteor set a grass fire near Kilgore. Fire trucks sent to investigate and extinguish the fire found nothing, however.

Two Ogallala, Nebraska high school boys reported that same night that a glowing object landed north of the town in the hills. A search Thursday night disclosed nothing, and a continuing search Friday yielded the same. One 16-year-old driving on the north edge of Ogallala said he was driving out of the northwest onto a highway just north of the city. He told police he picked up a 17-year-old friend and they drove about 700 yards into the hills where they saw a white, glowing object parked on the ground, and estimated its size as 100 yards by 30 to 40 feet high. Search later yielded nothing naturally.
