HE REMEMBERED THE TOWN SIREN SOUNDING AT 22202 JUST PRIOR TO THE 
SIGHTING. ALSO, THE OTHER OBSERVERS PLACE THE SIGHTING AS JUST
AFTER AN INTENSE SNOW FLURRY AND PRIOR TO A SHORTER SNOW FLURRY.
THESE SNOW FLURRIES OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATE TIME INTERVAL. I PLACE
THE SIGHTING IN AT THIS TIME INTERVAL A BASE T-33, NUMBER 724
WAS EXECUTING A PENETRATION AND GCA PICKUP. TRANSIENT C-47 919 WAS
ATTEMPTING TO ENTER A RECTANGULAR PATTERN IN THE EXACT AREA OF
THE SIGHTING. THE C-47 WAS TOLD BY THE TOWER TO HOLD IN THE NW
QUADRANT (THE AREA OF SIGHTING) UNTIL THE T-33 COMPLETED ITS

OBSERVER: THEN THE T-33 APPEARED FROM THE OVERCAST WITH GEAR DOWN AND LANDING LIGHT ON, AS THE GLIDE PATH WAS ENTERED. THE FLAP APPEARED TO CAUSE THE AIRCRAFT TO HOVER MOMENTARILY. THE WARM DRY SUBSIDENCE INVERSION FROM 3500 FEET TO 12000 FEET COULD HAVE CAUSED SOME BENDING OF THE IMAGE PURSUANT TO "APPARENT" PHENOMENA OF A UFO. THE DISAPPEARANCE DESCRIPTION OF EACH OBSERVER ALL GENERALLY AGREE IN DESCRIBING A PHASE OF A GCA OR MISSED APPROACH FURTHER, THE TERMS PHENOMENA FOR THAT EVENING WAS MISINTERPRETED BY AN EXPERIENCED FIELD GRADE PILOT AS AN AIRCRAFT PERFORMING NIGHT AEROBATICS. THE LOW, FAST MOVING SCUD CREATED THIS APPARENT MOVEMENT AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER CLIMBING ON TOP THAT THE IP, A FORECASTER OF 12 YEARS EXPERIENCE COULD CONCLUDE HIM IT WAS IN FACT VENUS. IT WAS FURTHER REVEALED IN INTERVIEWS THAT A DISCUSSION FOLLOWED THE SIGHTING, BEFORE IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED, FEARING RIDICULE THEY ADMITTED "TALKING IT OVER". IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT SIX AIRCRAFT SHOT GCA LOW APPROACHES AND/OR LANDINGS BETWEEN 2335Z AND 2542Z. SEVERAL OF THESE WERE MULTIPLE APPROACHES. IT IS MY CONCLUSION THAT THE LOW, FAST MOVING SCUD, BRIGHT STARS IS MY CONCLUSION THAT THE PHENOMENA.

SHINING THROUGH THE BROKEN OVERCAST, EXTENSIVE TRAFFIC AND THE IRREGULAR HOLDING FLIGHT PATH OF THE C-47 IN THE NW QUADRANT EACH AND/OR ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THE ALLEGED SIGHTING. NEITHER THE TOWER TRICK CHIEF OR GCA HAD ANY UNUSUAL INCIDENTS TO REPORT FOR THIS DATE.
