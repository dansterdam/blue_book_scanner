BOLIDE OF 1964 JULY 19, A.M.S. No. 2884

By Charles P. Olivier
Narbeth, Pennsylvania

ABSTRACT
Over sixty visual observations of an unusually bright bolide, sighted over British Columbia on July 19, 1964, 9:44 p.m. P.S.T., have been analysed to determine the approximate parabolic path of the object.

SOMMAIRE
Plus de soixante observations visuelles d'un bolide particulièrement brilliant aperçu dans le ciel de la Colombie Britannique le 19 juillet 1964 à 9:44 p.m. heure normale du Pacifique, ont été analysées pour déterminer la trajectoire parabolique approximative de l'objet.

On July 19, 1964, at 9:44 p.m. P.S.T., an unusually brilliant bolide was sighted over British Columbia and, moving in a general south-easterly direction, ended over Washington. Mr. P. F. Brogan, regional director for the American Meteor Society, began collecting reports from Canada would vastly assist in the solution, hence Dr. P. M. Millman of the Meteor Centre, National Research Council, Ottawa, was asked for assistance. He promptly supplied over 30 Canadian reports from a drawing of a preliminary projected path, derived by Prof. W. F. Slawson, University of British Columbia, Canada, from observations he had collected. Three reports were received from the U.S. Air Force, so that over 60 observations with varying degrees of accuracy were available.

The stations were plotted on a specially prepared map of the region, and azimuth lines were drawn for the directions in which the bolide was first and last observed from each station. As always there were great divergencies but fortunately the Canadian observer at longitude 122° 50' W., latitude 49° 13' N., saw it begin at a Ursae Majoris and cross over à Aquilae—actually it went much further. This observation gave fundamental points on the path and a very fine projected path since it passed almost through his zenith. Several other Canadians saw it near their zeniths and could tell on which side it passed. These observations confirmed the above projected path. The sub-end point was based mostly on American reports and a large proportion of these gave estimated

altitudes. One Canadian gave the path plotted among the stars, but his
calculated altitudes could not be reconciled with other observations used
to define the path. To derive the heights of the beginning and end points
of the path was very difficult. First, it is well established that most casual
observers greatly over-estimate altitude; it is here are more than 15° or 20°.
In this case some very distant observers gave altitudes of 30° to 45° 
which would give unreasonable heights and contradict nearer and ap-
parently more accurate reports.

The heights finally adopted are the result of a series of approximations,
too lengthy to describe in detail. A vertical plot was made of many
intermediate points as well as the beginning and end points. (One inter-
mediate point was almost certainly taken for the end point by many
observers since a great outburst of brilliancy took place there.) A line
was then drawn which confirmed as well as possible to these various
points. This choice is confirmed by the statement from many observers
that the path was almost or exactly horizontal. The adopted heights of
beginning, end, and the intermediate burst point, are given in the table.
On account of the great length of path, an error of a few kilometres will
have little effect on the radiant point and the orbit. This latter can be
considered to have a greater accuracy than the heights. The opinion of
most observers was that the colour was either blue, white or green, or a
combination of these colours and blue-green is probably correct. The
bolide was very brilliant with the zenithal magnitude at least -12; even
for distant observers the brightness is given as that of the quarter moon.
In deriving the duration of flight, estimates were omitted of those
observers who stated that they saw only part of the path. In addition,
one of 60 seconds was left out as being much too discordant; indeed it
may conceivably refer to the train, though statements as to the latter
are few and contradictory and most observers apparently saw none. The
duration from 3.5 to 5 seconds given by many observers indicates that
they saw only part of the path or underestimated duration, but these
values were included. There were several bursts; one observer states
there were six. It is unfortunate that no report was received from the
region near the end point, but that part of Washington is sparsely
populated. If our end height is nearly correct, any chance of recovering
meteorites is small despite the bolide's unusual brightness. The parabolic
orbit which follows shows direct motion and an inclination of 8°, which
is reasonable if the bolide came from the asteroidal zone.

This bolide has been assigned No. 2384 by the American Meteor

The writer expresses his most sincere thanks to Dr. Millman for so
generously lending the thirty-odd Canadian reports; any solution would
have been very uncertain without these. We also wish to thank Mr.
more than 60 individuals who made the observations and took the time
to report; without such co-operation the calculation of orbits would be
impossible.

Narberth, Pennsylvania

ABSTRACT
Over sixty visual observations of an unusually bright bolide, sighted over British Columbia on July 19, 1964, 9:44 p.m. P.S.T., have been analyzed to determine the approximate parabolic path of the object.

On July 19, 1964, at 9:44 p.m. P.S.T., an unusually brilliant bolide was sighted over British Columbia and, moving in a general south-easterly direction, ended over Washington. Mr. P. F. Brogan, regional director for the American Meteor Society, begun collecting reports at once from residents in the states of Oregon and Washington. Eventually these were sent to the writer, who belatedly attempted to calculate the path. However, it became evident that sighting reports from Canada would vastly assist in the solution, hence Dr. P. M. Millman of the Meteor Centre, National Research Council, Ottawa, was asked for assistance. He promptly supplied over 30 Canadian reports as well as a drawing of a preliminary projected path, derived by Prof. W. F. Slavson, University of British Columbia, Canada, from observations he had collected.
