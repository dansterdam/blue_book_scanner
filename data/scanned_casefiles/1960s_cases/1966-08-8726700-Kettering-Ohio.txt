1. This replies to your letter of 19 April 1967 regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object. If you had reported your 28 August 1966 sighting to the nearest Air Force installation, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible. Each Air Force installation has its own UFO investigative responsibility to gather all the pertinent information for analysis. Since, at this late date, an investigation cannot be accomplished, your information will be added to our data base.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Yesterday, 19 April 167
Newark 4, New Jersey
07104

Dear Sir,

On August 28/166
I was walking on the Broadwalk
with some friends. It was 8:25PM
at the time. My friends went
home but I stayed at the Broadwalk
at 8:30PM. I noticed that I
thought was an odd star. I went
to a friends house and studied
star. I found looking at the sky
with a telescope. I asked him what
he was doing he replied looking at
a U.P.O. I asked if I could take
a look he said yes it was the
same thing I had seen on the
Broadwalk. Here is my description:

(1) shape: oval
(2) Yellow orange was the color
(3) suggest the size of a tip only in oval
form
(4) Number: one
(5) Discernable features: Glinting (over)


- page 20 -

Here is the text from the document:

(6) sound: none

Course of U.F.O.
(1) northwest

(2) flight path: up and down and end
over land

(3) Length of time in flight: 1 hour
at 9:30 was over the ocean
and headed downward it seemed
to land in the ocean but then, it
came back up at 9:45 P.M. it had moved
over the lake upon 50 feet to 250 feet up
then it went up at least 5 00 feet
at 9:30 P.M. The next day we
read about a 16 ft. O.m. in all this shore
area. We saw it in the same course
for 3 strait nights and never saw
it again

Yours in Christ

P.S. send a answer with pictures
to compare with these. Yours sincerely,

Dear [redacted]

Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for detailed photographic study.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: Slide #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused in processing. Slide #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also show some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high lights and shadows by the extent of or lack of focus. The higher the magnification, the more could or alter the image's size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source.

Any identification from the submitted photographs would be only speculation.

Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated. I am returning your slides. Thank you for submitting them to the Air Force for evaluation.

Proposed reply to letter from

Dear

Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for detailed photographic study.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: Slide #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused in processing. Slide #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high lights and shadows by the extent of or lack of focus. The higher the magnification, the more focus can alter the image's size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification from the submitted photographs would be only speculation.

Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated. I am returning your slides. Thank you for submitting them to the Air Force for evaluation.

1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-12 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr. for an analysis and determination of the objects' identities, if possible.

2. ANALYSIS:
    a. Slides #1 & #7, from [redacted] appear to be as follows: #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot chip in emulsion probably caused in processing. #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high lights and shadows by the extent of or lack of focus. The higher the magnification, the more focus can alter the image size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification from the available information would be only speculation.

    b. Slides #10 and #11, from [redacted] were taken in the hours of near darkness and slides #12 and #13 were taken in daylight. All four of these slides appear to have been taken through the same window and nearly along the same azimuth. Slide #10 shows what appears to be a light source, airborne or elevated above the horizon. Slide #11 shows the same light source, or a similar subsequent light source in the same approximate position, dependent upon the time lapse between frames, but of a longer duration. A slower shutter speed on frame #11, as compared to #10, would produce a lighter transparency, a capture more of the movement of the object and make the object or image appear longer. These conditions have been met in frame #11 which is of lighter density and has a longer image. An aircraft landing light could produce such images.

    c. Slides #12 and #13 show linear patterns such as of smoke, gas, vapor or exhaust trails. These patterns appear in approximately the same area as the lights or reflections in slides #10 and #11. The linear patterns of the object in slides #12 and #13 are nearly parallel to the apparent movement of the light in slide #11. The similarity of implied motion in three of the four slides, #11, #12, suggests numerous objects traveling in the same area and same direction, such as traffic on an airport approach or airway.

Dear Mr [redacted]

Reference your recent correspondence regarding your observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Examination of the submitted negative has negated double exposure and/or retouching. Close inspection of the negative revealed many smaller images in addition to the bright image which is visible on the print. These smaller images appear to follow a course parallel to the path of the bright image indicating that the camera was moved rather than the image moving as the photograph was taken. Notation should be made of the fact that the images are located in the trailer section of the film and not in a normal frame position. With such specific details, there is no way to determine what produced the images.

The description of the visual observation is consistent with that of an aircraft sighting, yet aircraft operating at altitudes above 20,000 to 25,000 feet can be easily observed; however, unless proper conditions prevail, they cannot be heard. Lack of sound is not a valid reason to exclude an aircraft. After detailed investigation, it appears an aircraft could have been responsible for the sighting although it was not photographed.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen of the Air Force:

I have photos of a UFO. You people will call it something else, do to the fact that you put down people who try to prove to the people of the United States that life does exist on other planets, if they are in our time and space or not.

My name [REDACTED] I live in Minneapolis, Minn.
I saw I UFO on a clear sky over Minneapolis. The object was going south in the eastern sky. It was not a airplane do to the fact that a airplane makes sound. I heard no sound, and as the picture shows-no running lights. I losted the film somewhere, and was not able to find it, (I took picture in late August or early October). I did find it and had a negative made at the PAKO film company in Minneapolis. The object did not pass over head. The object was in the sky at about 2 of the overhead sky to the ground, (see file).

Time was about 7:00 & 7:50 pm. No airplane was around at that time.
Path was zig-zag. Shutter of camera was open at about 4 to 5 seconds, camera was also not moving and was on a base that did not more. Checking, I find out, shows that fireball, comets, and madman material in the sky does not zig-zag.

Speed was about or over 1000 miles per hour.

Color of object was orangeish-white and looked more dised than round.

Sky was clear ( see stars in picture ). There then, there was no lighting. It was a chilly night, and there was no heat lighting. I left shutter open to "peek" the object, and to get the tail of the path of the object.

The object as far as I can tell is unknown. I have never seen a object like it. A friend of mine, who made pictures out of the negative, said "I don't know what the object is"

Please send photo back to: [REDACTED]

Gentlemen of the Air Force:

I have photos of a UFO. You people will call it something else, do to the fact that you put down people who try to prove to the people of the United States what life does exist on other planets, if they are in our time and space or not.

My name is Kevin Dicks, I live in Minneapolis, Minn. I saw UFO on a clear sky over Minneapolis. The object was going south in the eastern sky. It was not a airplane do to the fact that a airplane makes no sound. I heard no sound, and as the picture shows-no running lights. I lofted the film somewhere, and was, not able to find it.(I took picture in late August or early October). I did find it and had a negative made at the PAKO film company in Minneapolis. The object did not pass over head. The object was in the sky at about 2 1/2 of the overhead sky to the ground. (see ill.)

Time: was about 7:00 & 7:30 pm. No airplane was around at that time.

Path was zig-zag. Shutter of camera was open at about 4 to 5 seconds. Camera was also not moving and was on a base that did not move. Checking, I find not, shows that fireball, comets, and mademan matical in sky does not zig-zag.

Speed was about or over 1000 miles per hour.

Color of object was orangeish-white and looked more dissed than round.

Sky was clear ( see stars in picture ). There was, there was no lightning. It was a chilly night, and there was no heat lightning. I left shutter open to "path" the object, and to get the tail or the path of the object.

The object as far as I can tell is unknown. I have never seen a object like it. A friend of mine, who made pictures out of the negative, said "I don't know what the object is"

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:)
Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
it moved behind: ______

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:)
Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what
in front of: ______

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - 
b. Color - light gold

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
[Handwritten text that is partially illegible, appears to read something like: "some times big as head"]

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

2. ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. Examination
of the submitted negative has negated doubt about exposure and/or retouching. Close inspection
of the negative reveals many smaller images in addition to the bright image which is visible
on the prints. These smaller images appear to follow a course parallel to the path of the
bright image. Notation should be made of the fact that the camera was moved rather than the

Major R. Quintanilla, TDEV/UFO, requesting photo analysis of the photographic phenomena which
appeared on photographs taken by Major M.Oard, Connecticut, while at Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York, on 21 August 1966.

2. ANALYSIS: The photography provided indicates central refraction with an undetermined
number of secondary refractions/reflections of the iris diaphragm in and on the optical
system. The circles within the hexagon shapes are defraction patterns. This is a perfect
textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

Proposed reply to letter from Mrs. [redacted], 10 September 1966

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your letter of 10 September 1966 in which you stated that you had photographs taken from the surface of the ocean into a sunset.

A photographic analysis of your color transparencies revealed the following: The photography provided indicates central refraction with an undetermined number of secondary refractions or reflections of the iris diaphragm in and on the optical system.

The circles within the hexagon shapes are defraction patterns.

This is a perfect textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

We wish to thank you for enabling the Air Force to review the photographs.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-4 (PPT 601021202) submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, TDEV/UFO, requesting photo analysis of the photographic phenomena which appeared on photographs taken by _______ of Stamford, Connecticut, while at Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York, on 21 August 1966.

2. ANALYSIS: The photography provided indicates central refraction with an undetermined number of secondary refractions/reflections of the iris diaphragm in an optical system. The circles within the hexagon shapes are diffraction patterns. This is a perfect textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

Detroit, Michigan 48234
March 29, 1967

Gentlemen:

My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following UFO report.

On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m. EST my friend and I were observing the moon with my 300x reflector. (We are both amateur astronomers). Taking a brief rest, we decided to take a stroll. As we glanced into the sky we noticed what appeared to be two ordinary airplane lights. Further observations, however, revealed a weird flying object with two legs. At the time, the sun was setting so features on the craft were distinguishable. My friend noticed that the object had two legs. Each leg had a light on the bottom. One light, red in color, was slightly by smaller than the green light. As the object approached zenith, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. At zenith the red and green lights disappeared and all that was visible was one, large, blinking yellow light that was apparently rising in altitude, as features were no longer clear. It curved and finally disappeared in the northeastern sky. Period of visibility was one minute, fifteen seconds.

Would you please give me your opinion of the sighting?

Yours truly,
[signature redacted]

Dear Mr [redacted]

References your recent letter reporting your August 22, 1966 observation of an alleged unidentified flying object. The late date of the report disallows a detailed scientific investigation.

We ask that reports follow observations as soon as possible after occurrence. This enables Project Blue Book's analysts to check the factors necessary to determine the cause of a sighting. If you had reported your observation shortly after the date of your sighting, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible. Your report will be filed for information purposes only.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I have enclosed the 1967 report on our project which I think you will find interesting.

At zenith the two lights disappeared and one enormous, yellow, blinking light was visible. The light rose in altitude, as features were no longer observable. I turned and finally disappeared beyond the northeastern horizon. The object had appeared in the west. Period of visibility was about one minute and fifteen seconds.

Very recently I reported this sighting to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and this committee was very interested in the report.

In order that the object might become more clear, I have drawn a diagram of the object below. I assure you this sighting is not a hoax. Would you please give me your personal opinion of the sighting?

Yours truly,

At the bottom of the page, there is a hand-drawn diagram labeled "22 August 1966 Sighting" showing a schematic representation of the described UFO with two lights and a rectangular shape.

Gentlemen:
My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following UFO report.

On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m. my friend [redacted] and I were observing the moon with my 300x reflector telescope (we are both amateur astronomers). Taking a brief rest, we decided to take a stroll. As we glanced into the sky we noticed what appeared to be two airplane lights. Further observations, however, revealed a weird flying object. At the time the sun was setting so features on the object were discernible. My friend noticed the object had two legs, with light on each leg. One light was red, the other was green.

The green light was slightly larger than the red light. When the object was near zenith, I noticed the northward part of the craft. At zenith the two lights disappeared and one enormous, yellow, blinking light was visible. The light rose in altitude, as features were becoming less observable. It curved and finally disappeared beyond the northeastern horizon. The object had appeared in the west. Period of visibility was about one minute and fifteen seconds.

Very recently I reported this sighting to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and this committee was very interested in the report.

In order that the object might become more clear, I have drawn a diagram of the object below. I assure you this sighting is not a hoax.

Would you please give me your personal opinion of the sighting?

Yours truly,
[signature redacted]

22 August 1966

1. Reference the attached letter from Peter Fulton Foss requesting information on two unidentified observations. His letter was forwarded to our office by the Operations Officer, U.S. Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, Texas.

2. We are unable to specifically identify the aircraft which he observed on 23 August 1966. In the Texas area, there are many conventional and experimental aircraft in operation, making it extremely difficult to locate the exact culprit. General Dynamics, in particular, is engaged in aerospace functions, for-they are the (builders of the F-111 aircraft).

3. We feel that the ECHO I satellite on 28 August was which was heading on a southeasterly direction at 2127 CST. ECHO I, with a stellar magnitude of plus 1 is easily visible on a clear night.

Dear [redacted]

Your letter to the International Airport at Corpus Christi, Texas, has been referred to this office for reply.

We are unable to specifically identify the aircraft which you observed on August 23, 1966, in the Texas area, there are many conventional and experimental aircraft in operation, making it extremely difficult to locate the exact aircraft. In example, the central Dynamic, Holloman Air & Pell aircraft, is engaged in aerospace functions.

We feel you observed the ECHO I satellite on August 28 which was heading on a southeasterly direction at 2127 CST. ECHO I, with a stellar magnitude of plus 1, is easily visible on a clear night.

Your interest is appreciated.

Gentlemen:

Would you be so kind as to tell me what the following flight movements were, or forward this letter to someone who can:

1) On August twenty-three at 120 pm I saw an aircraft moving moving over Ingleside about 850 up from the Eastern horizon. It was following a curve from West to East to North, was leaving a contrail, but was moving at an incredibly high rate of speed. The only thing that set this particular craft off from any of a hundred other high-flying planes I have seen was its high rate of speed. I would estimate strictly from a layman's point of view that it was moving in excess of 1700 miles per hour.

2) On August twenty-eight around 9:30 pm, perhaps sometime after 10:00 pm I saw what looked to be a satellite moving Northwest to Southeast. I was only able to watch it for about 10 minutes before it disappeared into the light of the moon.

Thank you very much for your kind attentions.

Sincerely,
WORLD WIDE TRAVEL, of Texas, Inc.

27. In the following sketch, imagine you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object and "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
