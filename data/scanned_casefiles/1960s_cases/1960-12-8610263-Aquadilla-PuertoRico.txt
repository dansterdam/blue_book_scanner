DEAR SIRS:

As requested, I am submitting the following letter in which I give my personal account of an unidentified object that I observed flying over the Aquadilla Airport area, Puerto Rico, on 17 December 1959. 

With regard to the sighting, I have, showing to the same on the different occasions, several unidentified objects that I observed flying at a relatively low altitude over the area. This object appeared to be very luminous and had a constant speed and direction. At first I observed a single object that later appeared to divide into two and then into three which continued to maintain a position relative to each other. All three objects then appeared to recombine into one and continue on in the same easterly direction. I tried to find a common landmark and locate the objects but was unable to do so as the vicinity of the Aquadilla Airport, where the sighting occurred, is rather small with few prominent landmarks that I could use to more accurately determine the locations and altitudes. 

As my eyes and I agreed that the objects did not appear to be conventional aircraft of any type, the description I have given, I believe, is as accurate as I am able to make it from my observations. I trust the information will be of some value to your office.

Very truly yours,

(signature illegible)
Major, USAF

AQUADILLA, PUERTO RICO.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Appearing very close in the space and a little bit behind a small, elongated object (but it was not a balloon) which moved very fast at a constant speed. I watched it closely and it appeared to me as a rather large, oval-shaped object, white in color, emitting a pale bluish-green glow, no wings or tail fins, and having no visible means of propulsion. It moved with a slight wobbling motion, ascending very smoothly and disappearing into the sky.

In case you could find a bit of time to make an investigation in this matter, I would like to hear from you as soon as possible and let me know the result of your findings.

Yours truly,
[signature redacted]
