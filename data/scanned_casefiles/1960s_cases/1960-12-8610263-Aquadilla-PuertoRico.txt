DEAR SIRS:

I inclose the following letter to you with the purpose of describing an unidentified object seen flying by me and my wife here in Aquadilla, Pno. Rico.

While I was showing to her some of the different constellations in the sky (I am an ex-professor of science) I noticed there was a star that was not supposed to be at the right hand side of URSA MINOR. This star shining with the intensity of a 1st MAGNITUDE STAR started moving very slow with a west - south-east eastern direction. At first I thought I was seeing wrong but my wife saw the moving "star" too. I tried to find a camera but there was none around the neighborgs then I kept watching the object till it reached close to a constellation called Colomb, where the object with a bright blue light started moving in a sort of WIGGLE or slow swinger till it disappeared in the sky.

Both my wife and I agree that the object had no red or blue light flickering all the way like the many airplanes passing around here to Ramey Field.

This object moved slowly in a straight line and took around 10 minutes to reach Colomb. We saw this phenomenon on 12/13/60 last Saturday and at 8:30 P.M. Puerto Rico time.

Here is the text from the document:

It is my personal opinion that this object was flying very deep in the space and if was not a balloon nor a rocket perhaps it was a satellite following a definite path but since it started wobbling and then changed its angle to an errand list I frankly must confess my surprise for a mile never seen such a thing in my long studies of the sky.

In case you could find out what it was I will like to hear about it. I certainly hope this one be far the benefit of those interested in what is going on around our sky.

Expecting your reply in a near future,

Yours Truly,
[Signature redacted]
