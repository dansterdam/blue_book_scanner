NOTE: ADDITIONAL CONTACT WITH WITNESS NOT DETERMINED ADVISABLE AT THIS TIME. SUCH CONTACT MIGHT INDICATE ON DUE IMPRESSION AS TO THE MOTIVE IN REPORTING TO THE VALUE OF THE REPORT.

Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
The object remained above the ground it did not rise as if the object were rotating individually.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 5
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
[Blank fields for Day, Month, and Year]

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in this specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Everynight at Yosemite Nat Park they have a fire fall
in which they let hot coals of a large wall fall 900
feet creating a rock street (continent). The object seemed
to come from almost known where and I could see
the point where the firefall was rolling. Plus by
the time the fire fell outside the object passed closely
over that part of the city.
