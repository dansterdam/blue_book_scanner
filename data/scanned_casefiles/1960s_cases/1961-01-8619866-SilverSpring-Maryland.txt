PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 13 Jan 61
2. LOCATION: Silver Spring, Maryland
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Civilian
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: 0 Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTINGS: Rapidly-flashing lights at horizon. (Lights were visible for about 12 minutes)
11. COMMENTS: The duration reported was just about 15 minutes. However, it would have been impossible for the witness to have clocked the object more than two or three minutes, at the most. The object was observed on radar and reported to the Control Operator. It was also visually observed. The rapid flashing of the lights is unexplained and they may have been more like two or three objects than one. This report should be categorized as insufficient data.

Complaint received at approx 9:45 PM on 25 February 1961. Witness - Raeburn Winfield Schmidt, 1313 Barrington Drive, Silver Spring, Maryland. 
The light was stationary at first - about 10 seconds - then it moved slightly for a few seconds - then it went up very rapidly to a great height and disappeared.
It was a very brilliant white light, approximately 4 inches in diameter and 8-9 feet above the ground. The light appeared to be round and slightly larger than a baseball. There was no sound associated with the light.
After moving up rapidly, the light simply disappeared and was not seen again.
The duration of the sighting was approximately 30-40 seconds.

1. The object was a reddish-orange light - a vehicle with a headlight.
2. The object was a high-flying jet or aircraft - not unusual.
3. The object was an unidentified aerial phenomenon - not explained.
4. The object was a reflected light - not explained.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text content of the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - low roar, rather slow escape
b. Color - unusual silvery, bright, rapid flashing, light

17. Draw a picture or sketch and give details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Object itself was not visible even the result of illumination by its own lighting. It appeared to be some distance away and very high, flashing at frequent intervals in a manner that suggest a regularly pulsed, rotating or flashing light source. Characterized by a peculiar "dancing" motion of its flashing light, rather than a steady beam or glow. This motion and flashing effect was noted by the observer to continue for several minutes before the object disappeared from sight.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing text and a hand-drawn diagram.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The output of the OCR system is:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A * * * B

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

About 23 inches in diameter. It was about the size of a saucer.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

The match head could probably just barely cover the object.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Yes, by fading.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

It looked like a match stick held at arm's length, but it was much larger and brighter than a match.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts an object in the sky above the horizon, with instructions to mark the position where the object was first seen. The second sketch depicts a larger view of a landscape, with instructions to mark the position of the object when it was first observed.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
