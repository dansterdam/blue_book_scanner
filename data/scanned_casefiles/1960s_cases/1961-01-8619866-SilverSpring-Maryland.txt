(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Signed]
DATE: 24 January 1961

I left my home at 8:20 on the morning of 11 January 1961 and backed out on Quaint Acres Drive leaving my VW. About in front of 501 Quaint Acres Drive my attention was directed to a bright, regularly-pulsating light to my left. First thinking an aircraft emergency was imminent, I started to step the car to get out. Before I could stop all forward motion, I suddenly I then was no emergency because the light was moving very gently from my left to my right at constant low altitude in a straight line down toward the north. It quickly disappeared behind trees and buildings so I could not obtain a position density.

Here is the text from the document:

Azimuth to flight path - presumably at a point of clearest approach. At this point I saw it three miles at was not believed I could distinguish turns. This was presumably on mine views. The light was still as before - white and roughly pulsating; it was roughly traveled to a more observation point stops on progress at a great signature - the intersection of route 29 and New Hampshire Avenue. This point was also beneath the flight path but maybe 3-000 feet from track north. Here I watched the light until I could me longer see it plank in the distance.

The following observations I cannot explain:
1. the bright, roughly pulsating light - white with almost long rays
2. the many bright-pulsed at very low altitude
3. the absence of observable air frame
4. the absence of any good sight normally encountered at in-flight

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound - None, above slow speed noise of wind
b. Color - Unusual white, bright, rapid flashing light

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Object itself was not visible even as the result of illumination by its own flashing light. The edges of the flash were characteristically jagged, e.g. [hand-drawn star shape with arrow], i.e. much more distortion than caused by ordinary glass in the line of sight to a light source.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

a. Other - not seen

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Points 1, 2 and 3 are positions with respect to the trajectory from which the phenomena was observed.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
Flash much brighter and faster than aircraft navigation lights.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

The match head would probably not have covered the flash.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, by being far away.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
