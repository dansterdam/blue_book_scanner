Text Transcription:

Yo no aproximaba cellas de retiración. Cada 4 o 5 minutos se producía una luz de color luminoso que iluminaba todo el ambiente durante unos 5 o 10 segundos. La oscuridad era prácticamente total y la iluminación duró unos 4 0 5 segundos, no siendo nosotros capaces de divisar nada concreto que pudiera producir esa iluminación.

La situación nos producía una extraña sensación y cierta impresión, dado que notábamos que nuestros movimientos eran observados y seguidos de cerca. Después de unos 30 o 45 minutos aproximadamente desaparecieron los 50 o 60 metros que nos separaban en el área del terreno sin que pudiéramos apreciar su desaparición. Tuvimos la sensación de que lo que observamos se elevó y se perdió en la oscuridad  del paisaje.

Douglas Case - 1963

Testimony of the traffic driver, who lives in the city of Venado Tuerto, Chile Street corner of Los Andes, Province of Santa Fe, Republic of Argentina. This person was sent to C.E.M.

" To be known, in order to be brief, I, on the 11 of Oct. 1963, took the crossroads from Chacin towards Cavanag, where I was to unload the carbon I carried in my 1.1/2 Ford, having to pass many little "Yucalos" to get to the latter. I noticed that it was sprinkling and that it was getting dark, what with the truck in bad condition I decided to spend the night in Venalacio Escalante . (Gov.)

But not finding a room in any hotel I undertook the trip once more flooring the accelerator in order to arrive at Cavanag. After crossing through Monte Mala with only about 7 kilometers to Pela Verde I saw small red lights. Thinking that it was a stopped/parked vehicle I switched my lights on and off, but I did not get any answer. Advancing about 15 to 20 meters, which I cannot swear to be correct, this above mentioned lights gave out a flashicutting off my current completely, for which reason my motor stopped dead.

I cannot give the precise time that transcoured after I got over the initial shock. I got out of the car, right side, observing what looked like a car but I did not approach. I then tried to start my truck but neither worked. I tried to find the trouble produced by the shock and noticed that the front axle was twisted and it was impossible to continue the trip. If it had only been the lights that the thing where wouldn't have been too much of a problem for me. 

At this time I took out a blanket and my .33 caliber short out of the holster.
I waited to see if a car would come in any direction that would take me to the nearest town. It was at this time that I noticed a glow coming from the direction of the Pelo Verde, which I couldn't explain and I waited about an hour and a half or two without observing anything else. Finally I decided to put the truck in gear and with the help of the starter I was able to move a few meters to put myself on the edge of the road. When daylight came I inspected the truck and saw that the front axle was twisted and the bumper torn off, and in this condition I was able to reach Pela Verde.

The image contains a photograph. The photograph appears to be a scanned document or report, likely from Project Blue Book. The document contains text describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO) that the witness observed.

Text from the document:

of Tala Verde that looked like an approaching car on the street that ran past my place. I was about to wave to the one where I shor and wa opposite from by street by fellow oak.

I was going to shout, thinking it was a farmer who had an entrance there, but at that moment we 30 or 20 meters 2 people walking illuminated by the lights of the vehicle, their clothes as/lights of the vehicle made me a bit suspicious.

I arote here that up to this moment I had not felt the slightest bit of fear, but the shock came so great when the vehicle burned its lights and I couldn't see the vehicle nor the people that I became frightened, all at once I saw a light that was very near me and was coming towards me. The light was red. It didn't sha from the one gave out those very fine rays of .ELECTRICITY that made my face and eyes sting. On the other hand it made a small sound which I couldn't find similar to anything. The light came upon me, I surrendered and spoke to it as a dead person. From then on I lost the notion of the trust.

My knees gave way. Fear had overtaken me. I asked God to help me and when it was at more or less a meter away from me I took my revolver out of its holster and fired at once at the light. It made a sound as if steel has been rubbed against a piece of something this light gave out a sound like a metallic sound of a car and went backwards a few meters. It took a blue light appearance and took off in at high rate of speed forward, illuminating upward. I fired another shot at the grounds and went into the field looking for shelter in an top of a small hill that I had previously noticed when I first stopped the truck.

When I had calculated that I was near the hill I shouted "Farmer''...........

From the hill two red lights appeared, that were more like mirrors than lights because they didn't illuminate rather they traced and reflected my steps. Then in my desperation I thought Tala Verde but the blue light which I had seen previously didn't return.

Illuminated ms once more. I wasn't able,due to my excited state to observe the fact that the light came from above or below.
I turned around quickly within the opposite direction, by this time confusing fear had its grasp on me and I started walking towards the open field when I got my hand on a piece of wire. I crossed through a plowed field than through a grove of trees. and was still all of a sudden it stopped,light in front of me and when I moved it moved with me.I decided to move towards it.It stopped in one place and didn't move any more.It looked like a mirror as it wasn't illuminated but reflecting something on the right side of me at about rib level a bright shaped vehicle was gliding off a blue light. It started up one or more motors,that made sounds similar to those of a diesel/engine. It was approximately 3 meters in diameter and 3 meters high which was small.Out of which blue light was coming.They were 60 to 80 centimeters high and long and they were about 1 or more meters separated.
I say someone's move inside,but I didn't see legs,or face.Just a body type form. It through that they had left for good,as it disappeared.
I looked around trying to orientate myself,walking towards the highway in order to arrive at town always looking around and searching all directions,but those little lights never left many appeared to be inter-mechanising signals and the red light was once more in front of me. I approached and they retracted. Every 400 or 500 meters it would stop. About 200 meters from the object on the other's it would again,be human beings or whatever they were walking in the same direction as I,I spoke to them,asking them all kinds of questions and propositions,but nobody answered.One of them came up very close to me in the 20 or 30 meters they walked beside me.
Noticing that he came closer I noticed triangular object in his hand,I was afraid he would place it on my head and I fired a shot. But all I noticed was as if a shadow had fallen backwards.the others kept on for a distance.

few more passes then they turned around and returned. They were about 2 meters tall, as it seemed, and some were of plastio light armor.Their uniform when it was illuminated by the shining lights seemed to call off smoke.
Once more I had the light on top of me.I covered my face once again with the rolled up blanket and in this manner we were face to face at a distance of about 9 meters for almost a minute.In this moment the small object darkened and I saw the large vehicle pass overhead with the two red beams on and no lights in the windows.
In this manner I was able to get to the city of Monte Pais enfocused from time to time to the light and especially by this light didn't leave me until I had reached the city. It didn't glare at my face to face at any time, it seemed to come from above.When I arrived at the city I asked the first person I met where the police station was since I didn't know.

Additional questions:

Question: Did they have anything on their heads?
Answer: Yes, like a helmet and it was shiny in the light.
Question: How many windows did the objects have?
Answer:I only saw windows in the big object,and it had two about 70 centimeters.
Question: What were the human beings like?
Answer:The same as us. They moved their arms like we do.
Question: Where did they leave and the red lights burn you?
Answer: On the cheeks. They made my eyes sting.My sight was a little cloudy for 3 or 4 days then I got over it.
Question: Did you notice anything strange in these humans?
Answer: That they were all more or less the same stature.And they never spoke. 
And they were a different dress than ours.
Question: What color were the objects?
Answer:The first one was white. The second one which was bigger was wood color.

OCR output:

the episodes about which he had some certainty. When he explained that the beings didn't seem to support themselves by leaning towards the ground he didn't know anything so justify this.

Question: Was there any time that he was confused?
Answer: There was a period about 2 or 3 hours from midnight till he arrived at the police station that he was confused. He explained that the red lights (the patrol car) followed him extraordinarily. He didn't know where he was or what he was doing.

Police Report:
The following day it was proved that the tracks were at the indicated place spoke of and his footprints through the field were found.

Transcribing the text from the document:

February 12, 1964

Dear [redacted] and [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of January 12, 1964 in which you request information concerning an investigation of a flying object by your organization. 

While this report has been of considerable interest to the Air Force, this is one of several similar sightings and reported happenings which are being investigated by BLUE BOOK. Based upon the information received, there appears to be some confusion and increased this sighting. In order to make an evaluation of a report such as this, it is necessary to have complete data such as description of the object, observations, etc. 

In order to make an evaluation of a report such as this, it is necessary to have complete data such as description of the object, observations, etc. Data such as the location, shape, and motion of the object, the duration of the sighting, the appearance and disappearance, and the number and identification of the witness or witnesses is essential.

Enclosed is a brochure which lists several of the reports which were investigated by the Air Force. There are no photographs available for release on this subject.

Your continued interest in this matter is appreciated. Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions or comments.

Sincerely,

TO: UFO Sighting (Santa Fe, Argentina)

1. Reference the attached letter from (redacted). The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to this report on the UFO sighting of (redacted) near Santa Fe, Argentina.

2. The sighting has been reported to us indirectly and therefore the information should be investigated due to the delay in receipt of the report. The object appeared to be small, and therefore a field investigation would be advisable.

3. It is not our desire or intent to expend or redirect your very limited investigative resources. However, we would appreciate any information you can provide concerning this report.

4. Our opinion, not for release, is that this case follows a pattern of sightings classified as "Insufficient Data" - that is, insufficient evidence, corroborating data, and follow-up investigation to support or refute the validity of the report. All such reports have failed to produce any evidence of their actual occurrence. The testimony and description gathered thus far, in our opinion, indicates possible distortion of basic facts or insufficient data to establish the reality of the occurrence. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that no unusual aerial phenomenon occurred. We recommend that you conduct a field investigation, if possible, to confirm or refute this report.

FOR THE COMMANDER

Text transcription:

LANDING IN ARGENTINA: From our special correspondent we learn that landings or flying saucers in Argentina have continued throughout 1962. On September 29th, 1963, a truck driver near Santa Fe told police that at 5:30 a.m. on that date, he saw an object the size of a truck with a dome land on the road and a small humanlike figure emerged from it. The figure approached the truck and the driver became frightened and drove off, leaving the object behind. He later learned from police that the object had taken off and disappeared. Doctors who examined the driver were not able to find the cause of the burns.

OCR Text:

"CASO MILITAR" - 9 JULIO 1962

Relato de un caso de observación extraoficial, sobre un objeto luminoso en la ciudad de Venado Tuerto, Provincia de Santa Fe, Argentina.

Según la descripción del testigo, quien formula la denuncia, el 9 de julio de 1962, aproximadamente a las 20.30 horas, en el momento que se encontraba a una cuadra de su domicilio, en las calles Formosa y Avellaneda de la citada ciudad, divisó a unos 300 metros de distancia, un objeto luminoso que se encontraba suspendido en el aire, a una altura aproximada de 30 metros sobre el nivel del suelo. 

Dicho objeto tenía forma esférica y sus dimensiones aproximadas eran de unos 10 metros de diámetro. Emitía una intensa luz blanca que iluminaba toda la zona circundante. Estuvo suspendido en el aire durante unos 5 minutos, desplazándose lentamente y en forma horizontal. Luego se elevó verticalmente a gran velocidad, perdiéndose de vista en pocos segundos.

El testigo afirma que al observar este fenómeno, se encontraba en compañía de otras personas, quienes también lo presenciaron. Según su manifestación, quedó impresionado por lo insólito del hecho y decidió formular la denuncia correspondiente ante las autoridades militares de la zona, las que a su vez informaron el caso a los organismos competentes.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

IT IS ESTIMATED AND BASED ON THE FILES THAT OVER 0 OF THE TOTALTOTAL SIGHTINGS WERE IDENTIFIABLE AS AIRCRAFT, BIRDS, ASTRONOMICAL BODIES, WEATHER PHENOMENA, ETC. THIS MEANS THAT OVER 0 WERE NOT EXPLAINED, WERE RECORDED AS UNKNOWN.

AT THE SAME TIME IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN MANY CASES WHERE SIGHTINGS WERE LABELED AS UNKNOWN BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY WERE UNEXPLAINABLE PHENOMENA. IN MANY CASES THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT DATA OR INFORMATION PRECLUDED A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION.

IT IS ALSO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT MANY PERSONS WHO REPORT SIGHTINGS ARE NOT SKILLED OBSERVERS AND THAT THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THEY SAW CANNOT ALWAYS BE RELIED UPON AS ACCURATE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES WHERE FURTHER INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT WHAT THE OBSERVER THOUGHT WAS A UFO WAS IN REALITY SOMETHING QUITE ORDINARY.

AFTER EXAMINING THE PROJECT BLUE BOOK FILES IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT IN MANY INSTANCES SIGHTINGS WHICH WERE INITIALLY LABELED AS UNKNOWNS WERE LATER EITHER SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED OR THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO WARRANT CONSIDERING THEM AS ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNEXPLAINED SIGHTINGS IN THE PROJECT BLUE BOOK FILES, IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK INVESTIGATORS THAT THESE CASES, THOUGH UNEXPLAINED, DO NOT PROVIDE PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF INTERPLANETARY SPACESHIPS. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT THEY WERE IN FACT INTERPLANETARY SPACESHIPS.
