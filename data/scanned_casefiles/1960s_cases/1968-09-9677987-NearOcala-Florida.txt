PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 10 September 1968 - 9:30 PM EDT
2. LOCATION: Near Ocala, Florida 
3. SOURCE: Civilian Pilots
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two (2)
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: A light doing acrobatics near Ocala was observed for 15 minutes but did not conform to any known light type and quickly disappeared. This rapidly came toward the observers, then sharply curved, and then disappeared. The third part of the observation was also strange as the object came back retracing its path but at a much higher speed before finally disappearing.
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Unidentified

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. Instead, it appears to be a transcript or record of an interview or conversation regarding a reported UFO sighting near Ocala, Florida.

Let's see. They left lease that long.

Oh yes. Here is says "Jacksonville Center couldn't pick it up on radar. We followed him until we were almost to Ocala, and he disappeared off into the sky on a heading of something like 200° and then as we approached Ocala there was an object. At first it was a white light. It was hanging right over Ocala"--where is Ocala?

Do you know where Gainesville is? (Yes) Directly southeast of there.

Fine. And then he said, "It was hanging right over Ocala and just as I finished reporting the other one this one came right at us. We were on a collision course. I would say he missed us about 1 mile. He came straight at us in an angle. We were about 15 miles out of Ocala still on a heading of 120. This object came straight at us in a climb attitude then turned right in front of us to the west. He went out about 15 miles west of Ocala and just hung there at an altitude of 9000, I would guess that he was at probably 6000 or 7000 ft."

What are the chances do you think, Captain, that these fellows were sufficiently poor observers to have mistaken stars at various times? Of course, they were on a straight course at that time, they were not making maneuvers.

I'm not a firm believer in UFO's and I've never observed anything like this, but from the way they verbally talked to me, I would say they saw something.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page of text from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page discusses an encounter with an object that was brighter than a star and moved erratically, with the witness stating that it was not a balloon. The text also mentions the object making "tremendous turns" and moving in "straight lines", suggesting it exhibited unusual flight characteristics.

H Something that was much different than a star and was apparently brighter, a brighter star light than that, that was not of such intensity, that it was bright enough to really get alarmed about.

H Yes. And balloons would be out of the question because they covered too much territory, for the thing to be a balloon.

** Yes sir. A balloon if you saw it wouldn't disturb you too much. It might shock you a little, but I think you'd recognize it. They wouldn't turn or bob around that much.

H Now, when he says it moved up and down and had -- well, I'm going to try and get in touch with him and see if I can pin him down on trajectory. In other words, when it moved, was its traverse motion as much as say 20-23" or was it just a minor movement. That's the sort of thing that I'd like to -- I would gather that it covered considerable portions of the sky.

** Yes sir. And the way he talked, he said it would go in straight lines. It would turn an immediate 90" turn, it was very definite fast movement, and it would make very, very sharp turns. He said he had never seen a lot of jets flying and this thing couldn't have been anything like a jet, because it made such erratic climbs and such tremendous turns, immediate turns, that he knew that we have nothing that flies like this.

H Now I'm getting to a part here that I have a question on. This is still speaking. "We saw him move several times but when we last sighted him, it looked like he was sitting on the ground just west of Ocala."

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing typed text discussing details of an incident.

OCR output:

Now, you came on the line and said, "We had a height finder on you and were tracking you and there was an object behind you for quite awhile northwest of Palm Beach." This then would have been about half and hour or so after the Ocala incident.

** Yes sir. It was definitely later than Ocala.

R And then you say, "We had numerous height finder checks on you; also an object less than 1 mile behind you." Mr. ___ then says, --oh yes. here's a part I missed earlier--Mr. ___ said, "We turned and saw what appeared to be the same white light as we saw over Ocala, in a steep turn."

** OK. That's when we asked him to make that 360° turn over Palm Beach.

R I see. And then he says, "When we saw it, it looked like it descended rather rapidly. I would definitely not try to identify it." Then you asked him about the thought, it didn't look like a jet aircraft can't make the sharp turns these things were making." And then you asked, "Everytime you saw it, it was making steep turns?" And he said, "No, it would hover and then it would proceed on course exactly the same way we were going, ahead of us then it would go straight up, over the top, or straight down."

Did he add anything? Let's see, this -- was this a telephone conversation?

** Yes sir. I called him long distance and talked to him immediately after.

- page 4 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document.

Transcribing the text:

he got on the ground down there, about 20 minutes after landing. He came up to the tower at Palm Beach and we talked to him long distance.

H I see. That's how it was. There was nothing being reported while-- he didn't report anything on tape to Jacksonville Center, did he?

** No sir--now possibly, they're on tape. I would imagine the controller's taped all this.

H I'll perhaps talk with and see what -- I didn't realise this divided itself into two very distinct phases.

** Yes sir, it did. After that Ocala area incident where they saw him on the ground, then apparently they were harassed by him on down. I don't remember exactly, but it seems like they were harassed any after than until they got in the Palm Beach area and we got the radar contact and had them turn 360° there on Palm Beach approach.

H And then, of course, one always wonders about the powers of suggestion. They apparently thoughtthe whole incident was over and then they were asked and then they see it, and now it becomes a question of what type of observers they really are. Did they get excited and say "Oh yes, there it is" and mistake some -- on the other hand they did describe its trajectory. It's a hard question to ask you, but from your conversation with them, which lasted how long, altogether?

** Between ten and fifteen minutes. I think it was ten or eleven minutes on the telephone bill.

Text extracted from the document:

"Let me ask a question like this. If they were on a witness stand, if this had been a courtroom proceeding and you'd been the defending or prosecuting lawyer, how would you have regarded their testimony in ordinary terms--if this wasn't an UFO they were talking about? Did they sound valid?

Yes sir, they did.

I sometimes talk to people who get vague and repeat themselves and extrapolate and don't stick to facts.

They pretty well said again over the telephone exactly what had happened, they followed the sequence on it. It was normal. They things that they had discussed with Jacksonville Center they went through, and they remembered what Center Control they were under. It was just like they had lived through it. They weren't frightened by it; they weren't too overly concerned.

I'd like to get from them just how much brighter it was than the brightest stars.

Well, they said that it was like observing, it was a large light like the ones we see on military aircraft or commercial aircraft. You know, the ones that turn. They said it was of about a size like that but not that bright. It was a pretty good-sized light from the way they talked.

Now, I don't want to take too much of your time here. Let's talk..."

Here is the text from the document:

about Mr. just a second, the co-pilat. He gave just one paragraph here. One thing that interested me was "I thought we were close to the warning zone and had caught a sidewinder. I was ready to meet the Lord, it didn't make any difference, but it sure scared me." How did he sound in comparison to Mr. 

** Well, I got him on the line at the end of the conversation with Mr. primarily just to thank him and see if he had anything to add, but he was very definite. He was, in terms of conversation, he was more definite than Mr. was more collected and cool, and was aware of what was going on. Mr. was a little high strung about it, I think.

" Yes, I would gather that from his statement here, "getting ready to meet the Lord," and so forth.

** The comments that he made were rather excited and he was trying to get the idea across that they did see something and it wasn't something they were playing around with, and they, when they saw it they tried their best to observe it and find out what it was and try and decide what was going on. This warning area he refers to is a typical military warning area out over the water there, that sometimes we do have firings in and stuff. There's quite a few jets out flying in that area; there's restricted altitudes and everything that they work out there, and normally whenever they're out in that area there's quite a few different involved, and the civilian pilots try and avoid these areas absolutely.

" Well, I want to thank you very much for this information. It clears up the thing up. It gives me a clearer picture, but it doesn't clear it up.

Text extracted from the document:

because I still don't know what the hell it was they saw. I think I'm going to try and get in touch with Mr. I'm thinking I'll let him know I think probably if I call Mr. also and get his part of his contact with them, and particularly see if he has any records they may have made at the time.

If you think of anything else that you feel that I should know about this I'm easily reachable; simply the Department of Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Or send it through Colonel Quintanilla; I so there ones a month as a sort of regular tour of duty and look over the cases they've had during the month.

Let me ask a purely general question here. In your area down there, have there been many, or any, UFO reports that were not easily solvable?

** Very, very few sir. If we have them, they're normally widely scattered and I think here a month ago we had maybe a sighting in the Montgomery area here. Once in a while there are some down along the Coast, but, of course, I never know. I see something in the newspaper, or get something reported past me here at work, but normally there's no conclusion out of it.

H Yes. Well, if something comes up that you feel compares with this, or is other than could easily be explained as an aircraft or balloon, or something, I would appreciate your getting in touch with me, or with Project Bluebook.

** All right sir. We certainly will. Well, thanks ever so much.
VW Thank you Dr., it's been nice talking to you.

Transcript of UFO sighting: telephone conversation between Hynek & Capt. Cole

H	Hello, Capt. This is Professor Hynek at Northwestern University. I'm also consultant to the United States Air Force on the matter of unidentified flying objects. I have a letter here from Col. Quintanilla asking me to look into the sighting of September 15. I've also talked recently with Capt. Hemberg, who I believe, interviewed you after you got to the airport.

C	Yes, I didn't remember the name. I believe that's right.

H	Well, this is a most interesting case, and I wanted to check with you a little bit. As I understand it there were two definite phases to this sighting: One was near Ocala.

C	This is correct.

H	And then about a half an hour or so elapsed and when you got down into the Palm Beach area . . . 

C	No. Now the first sighting was north of Ocala.

H	All right, this is fine. Why don't you just give me the time-motion sequence and I'll just remain quiet here and you tell me in your words.

C	OK. I'll be glad to. We were, we had left Dallas early afternoon--that was on a Sunday-- and we were going to MATS Manus and we stopped in New

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

Orleans to pick up a passenger. We left there on instruments. However, the weather cleared by the time we were to Pensacola; this was on Sunday and they gave us permission to go across the restricted areas of Eglin and along the shoreline. We stayed just on the north edge of, I believe that's war zone 470 there; whatever that is in the Gulf there. We had just passed the northeastern corner of this and Jacksonville Center gave us permission to turn to the southeast; as I recall our heading was about 120°, and I don't sidled any object which I assumed to be a jet, probably a trainer they're are lots in that area, you know. We watched it. As I recall we were at an altitude of about 9500 feet. I believe that's correct. We watched this thing; I watched it for, oh, five minutes, I guess.

H Pardon me. When you say "this thing", could you be more specific with it. Was it light or was it...

C Well yes, it was a pale green flashing light. It was flashing at a little more than, a little slower rate than the average aircraft red rotating beacon. It was a pale green color.  

H In terms of brightness of a star, was it brighter th or dimmer than...?

C It looked very similar, if you were observing an aircraft landing light, I'm sure you've watched, I would say five miles, five to eight miles. Something like that, except that it had a green tint to it.

H Did it have any extension to it, or was it a point source?

The image does not appear to contain any photograph. It seems to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

NO, NO it was just a light, in a particular spot. It didn't project a beam or anything.

And how close to the horizon did it seem? 

Well, it was directly in front of us at our same altitude; in fact, it was at an identical altitude and he was doing aerobatics. He would go straight up and then over the top and straight down to maybe 300-1000 feet below us, below our altitude, and then he would return to our altitude. He did this several times, and I have seen jet practice, military practice, and this is right on I assumed this was what it was, but the fact that, of course it was night. I was on an instrument flight plan, and it irritated me because Jacksonville Center had not warned me of this traffic. And so I called them and I said: "Have you got traffic at our twelve o'clock position?" And he said, "Negative." And I thought, out on that side of the state, there radar reception is a little bad, and I've been through that before there before, and so I fly on for, oh, I'd say, five minutes or so, and the fellow in the front seat with me there is also a pilot...

Mr. [REDACTED], yes. And I hit him and I said, "Boy, I don't know how in the world those fellows do that at night." See, we were over the water at that time, with no visual ground reference. And, of course, you know, you tumble your instruments after a certain altitude. So, both of us are there watching it.

Now, could I break in here to ask, in terms of degrees arc, you
say he went up and down over an arc of any 10 degrees, or what?

There didn't seem to be an arc. Now at night, you can't judge these
things, but if the object directly towards you or directly away from you,
you can't see the arc at night.

No, quite right.

And I assumed this is what it was. But there did not appear to be any
arc, it would go straight up and then straight down and then straight back
up again.

No, wait a second. You say up, then in angle of elevation, if he
started at your own level, how high did you have to look to see him when
he was at the top of his...

I would guess he went a 1000 feet above us.

Well, would that have been 10? Did he come overhead at any time?

No, he never did. He stayed in front of us all the time. I would
guess an up angle of something like probably 10°, not over 15, and about
the same below us.

I see. So a total swing of about 30° perhaps, 20 or 30. And how about
transverse, sideways? Was it always directly in your 12:00 o'clock position?

- page 13 -

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with typed text.

No, he would swing a little bit to the side once in a while, and usually to our left. 

By the way, was it a clear night?

At that point it was. There was one storm cloud northeast of Ocala City that had lightning in it, but we were already south of it. We were out in perfectly clear weather.

The reason I asked, is were there any good navigational stars at your 12:00 o'clock position or near your 12:00 o'clock position?

No, not on the horizon. There were some higher, but not on the horizon.

Could you sort of plot this chap's motion with respect to the stars?

Well, he never got as high as, that is, during the time we were watching him in the early phases of it, when he was doing these various actions; he later, I would say 15 minutes after we first observed him, he made about a 10° turn off from our track, and just disappeared in the sky at a climbing angle of, I would say, 10° and disappeared.

Now, in this 15 minutes you covered about how many nautical miles?

Well, were truixng right at 200 miles an hour, whatever that would figure out.

Transcription of the text in the document:

H  Well, about 50 miles. And that would have meant that had he been 
just going up and down or stationary, you would have overtaken him.

C  Yes, this is true. But he maintained just about the same distance
in front of us until he decided to leave us

H  And your bearing at that time was about 120?

C  120°.

H  And the time at that time, was what, local time?

C  Let me see. If must have been about, as I recall, about 9:00. 9:30.
I've forgotten what time it was. It was well into the night.

H  I was trying to see whether I could recognize any bright stars in that
area for reference points. Well, anyway, please go on.  

C  Then, about that time, just as he disappeared, I was well into conver-
sation with Center at that time and they were very interested.

H  This is Jacksonville Center?

C  Jacksonville Center, yes. And I called, I was exactly 12 dme miles, as
I recall, from Ocala, off the Ocala 206 radial, and I could see the lights of
Ocala from that position, and I could see a bright white light. Now, this

- page 15 -

There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document says:

looked exactly like an aircraft landing light from the distance where we were 
and I could tell it was right over, right in the lights of Ocala at an 
altitude of what I would guess to be about 5000 feet, well below us. And 
sitting there, he wasn't moving at all. So when I took my eyes off from 
where we saw the other object disappear, I asked Jacksonville Center if 
they had an object directly over Ocala.

H.  How many minutes was this after the first one disappeared?

C.  It was just at the same time. Just at that very minute. We were 
still talking about the first one, and I came back and I said, "Well, what 
about right over Ocala?" Do you have a target there?" And he said, 
"Negative." And I said, "Well, we have a bright light there,"and in the 
same transmission I said, "And he's moving toward us," and then I just 
hollered at the microphone, "We're on a collision course," and there the 
microphone down to try to take evasive action. This one moved directly 
at us. And I was quite certain that we had victimized by a sideswinder, 
because, and both of us, it scared us to death. We were ready to leave the 
airplane. If we could have. But the thing came straight at us and I'd 
say at 4 distance of, I'd don't know, maybe two miles, you can't tell 
those distances at night, but he made an instantaneous 90° left turn and 
at our altitude. Well, I'd wouldn't say just, he was maybe 500 feet below 
us.

H.  How could you be sure, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not doubting 
your word here. I just want to get clear in my own mind, how could you be 
sure of that?

ure that this was the same object, the same light, you saw over Ocala. You say it actually came toward you then?

C Yes. From the time we saw it, this was much brighter, much closer to us than the first object we saw, but it was hanging directly over Ocala.
Have you ever, do you fly yourself?

H Only commercially, quite a bit.

C Well, you'd have noticed then, coming into cities at night, even on a clear night, there'll be haze many times and the lights of the city shining against it, well, there was this haze at about, probably 6000 feet, or something like that, and this bright light was below that haze.

H Below the haze?

C Yes, and, of course, the haze was not of such thickness that we couldn't see through it. You see, but this light was just hanging there, and it moved directly toward us and then turned and descended again, and it went lower than it was originally when we saw it. It went a distance, I told them 15 miles, but I couldn't tell the distance. It went some distance west of Ocala and he just parked out there, and sat there, and we flew on past it.

H At its closest point, then you, of course, I recognize this is purely an estimate, but you estimated he might have gotten as close as one or two

miles to you, is that correct?

C This is correct, yes. 

H It was still then a light and you could make out no craft as such?

C Oh no, it was a dark night, and we couldn't see anything but just the light.

H Yes. And in terms of brightness, how would it have compared with the brightest star in the sky?

C Well, it was much brighter, much brighter, because at that point it was closer to us and much larger.  

H How larger. Did you mean that it ceased being a point source and became actually found light, or something.

C Well, from the time we first saw this one, it was a round light.

H Suppose you held an aspirin tablet at arm's length, how would its apparent size compare with that?

C That's hard to say.

H When it was closest?

- page 18 -

There is no photograph present in this scanned document page. However, the document contains the following text:

Well, for example, I'm sitting right now a half a mile from a mercury vapor light, street light, and I would say it was just about what I'm looking at right now.

So, it's still essentially a point source.

Yes, I guess you'd call it that. 

I was trying to see whether at any time it got actual size to it, apparent size.

Oh, I see what you mean. These things are awful hard to judge at night. I have about 6500 flying hours and have seen just about all kinds, but these things are so hard to judge at night.

Was this a unique experience for you, or had you seen something like it before?

No, I have never seen anything like this before in my life. I've seen shooting stars at night, and well, after we lost sight of this last one, my friend, Mr. ______'s kind of emotional, and I started playing with him. He started sighting stars, which I had already recognised as stars, and I would slowly jockey the airplane around, you know, you can turn the aircraft while your eyes are fixed on an object, and the object moves, and I started playing with him. I'd pull the nose up a little bit and it'd look like it took a nose-dive, you know, and shove the nose over, and it looked like it took off. And it looked like it

climbs. And then you can turn a little bit at night, and it'd bank go from side to side. But, this was not our case, I can assure you. He got all excited and said, "Call 'em, call 'em," cause I knew what I was looking at. but then, when we got into Jacksonville, into West Palm, Miami Center called them, we were on Miami Center then, and we had already turned from Oenter to West Palm Approach Control, but Miami Center called them and told them they had an object a mile behind us, following us.

H I want to get the sequence here straight. When Miami called you, had they known anything at all of your report to Jacksonville Center?

G Yes. See we had been shifted to Miami Center. Oh, let me see, just south of Oasis. You know, they shift you from Center to the other, as you go into their area. We had been on Miami Center for some time, oh goodness. I don't remember the time, it's been so long ago. It was whatever the time it would take, I would say, half an hour, from south of Oasis on into West Palm, and they had changed us to West Palm Approach Control. and just after we changed, as I recall, we just about an even 10 miles, 10 time miles out of West Palm, and we down to, as I recall, 3000 or 4000 feet, and Miami Approach, I mean Miami Center, called West Palm Approach and asked us to do a 180, because they had an object, an unidentified object, following us, a mile behind.

H This was a radar sighting?

G Yes, a radar sighting. Well needless to say, my throat filled up, but I turned, and, a sharp turn at night, you do well to maintain you

equilibrium, much less sight things, you know, but I did see a bright light
similar to the one that we saw over Ocala. You see, by this time we were
over 4 populated areas and many, many lights on the ground, and I told them
I couldn't positively identify anything because I did see one bright
light that seemed to descend very quickly when we turned, but I don't know.
I wouldn't even . .

Now, if this were the same thing, then Palm Beach radar should have
seen their radar image descending.

Well, Miami should, I don't think West Palm has any radar.

What I'd like to know is whether Miami had both you, in your 180-degree
turn and the object.

Well, now, I don't know. I assumed they did, because they were tracking
us and they said they had this object behind us, so you just have to discuss
that with them.

Well, I think actually the important sighting is the earlier one,
Well, they're both important, the radar part, of course, if we could establish
that this was actually a simultaneous visual-radar, but those are very
difficult to establish positively.

Well, as I understand, there are many cases where these things have been
sighted but radar did not pick them up. Now, if this is some kind of
machinery that we don't know about, somewhere else, they obviously have powers
beyond, to scramble radar, so I don't know.

I want to ask one other thing, here. When you were approaching Ocala
and saw the white light, that was presumably not the green light, the green 
light had gone now ...

Right, this is true.

- page 21 -

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

That had gone up, hadn't it?
We had lost complete sight...
Now then, within a minute or so apparently you saw this white light below the haze.
This is correct.
Could you be sure that the light didn't start, actually, from the ground?
Yes, I can be absolutely certain. This light was no less than 4000 and no more than 5000 feet high, I would say with all authority.
OK, and you say it appeared to be sitting there at first?
This is correct.
And then it took off as though it was conscious of you there? Or did you feel that its reaction was totally independent?
Well, believe me this thought entered my mind. And if I were saying "yes" or "no" I'd say "yes, it was obviously something monitoring our craft" because it was heading to straight for us and then it made too much of a diversionary turn.
In other words, it saw heading straight for you, and then it made a diversionary turn and then a 90o turn.
No sir, it first made a 90o turn. It came directly at us, coming up and turned us and then it made a 90o turn to the left, and went west of Ocala and descended again and went possibly all the way to the ground.
Now wait a minute, I want to get something straight. You were already, you were approaching Ocala. Ocala was at what? About your 12:00 o'clock position?
It was at our directly our 12:00 o'clock position, and we were getting

Transcript for UFO sighting: telephone conversation between Hynek and Capt. Hainbault:

This is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University and I'm also the consultant to Project Bluebook, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, on unidentified flying objects. Some time ago, about a week ago, Colonel Quintanilla asked me to look further into the case from Florida which occurred on 15 September 1968.

This is the one that was done in the Palm Beach area, northwest of there?

Yes, that's the one. I've been trying to get in touch with the pilots so far I've gotten no answer and, of course, the copilot. Since you've talked with them, and since Colonel Quintanilla has asked me to look into this further (it's an odd-ball case certainly; there's enough of these reports, though, so that I, at least, am taking them seriously without being a believer in little green men) I wondered in your discussions with these two men what your basic impression was of their reliability and what your own feelings on this case are.

Well, both of these gentlemen are in the ministry; they're evangelistic type individuals--

That's what's meant by the term 'missionary pilots', then. I didn't know what that really meant.

This is why they weren't available for discussion the following day. They had to get out to a couple of the islands and see some of their parishes out there, apparently. I talked to them for ten minutes, at least.

I remember exactly, I had a 12-mile (it was either 10 or 12 mile) DME reading off of Ocala when we saw this object.
And then, of course, you say it turned to its left then?
That is correct, yes.
Because it had to go west, yes. So it made a right-angle turn to the left, to the west and that prevented it from hitting you, then presumably.
That is correct, yes. At that point I knew it wasn't a missile because they have no control, I understand, over those things once they're gone.
Immediately after it made the 90 degree turn, then what?
It descended.
It descended.
And it continued west and descending and the best we could tell it was either on the ground or very, very close to it.
And did it change in brightness?
Oh yes, when it went away from us, the light was pale green, just like the first one we saw. As it was coming toward us the light was very similar to a strobe between fluorescent light and incandescent light. It had some tint to it, but it was brighter white as it was titled. And, but as it went away it had a green tint, just like the first one.
Well! And about the same brightness?
About the same intensity, yes.
Did it ever blink out, or was it, did it ever seem to twinkle like a star, or blink out,...?
No, it was consistent. As it would go away, its flashing was consistent just like a rotating beacon...
It was flashing, I see, so it was not a steady light, it was a pulsating light.

Light.
C Yes, this is right. When it was coming toward us, now, it was steady, but as it went away it had the same flash as did the first object did.
H Of course. I can see what some (I'm not saying this) but some chap is liable to say, "Well, when it was coming toward you you saw the landing light in front which was bright, then as it turned away you saw the green wing light" or something. But how could you contest, or how would you
answer that?
C No, there was no comparison. You see of course on the aircraft you've also got a red wing light and white tail light. But we, I looked diligently for any aircraft identification type of light, and there were none.
H And when it was on the ground, what was it flashing or steady then?
C No, it was steady then as we saw it on the ground. We couldn't tell any motion to it at all.
H This was after it had descended.
C After it had descended and seemed to come to a halt.
H So then you saw and did the color change then?
C No, it was, that far from us all we could see was just light. I couldn't tell you color other than just, it was more of just a bright light.
H When it was near the ground, was it in a populated area or...?
C No, this would have been, as I recall, now I didn't check the map too closely, but I believe that area between Ocala and St. Pete and Tampa there is pretty unpopulated.
H Yes, I think so too.
C There were very few lights around, I believe that's mostly swamp in there.
H Well, now let me ask you this as sort of a human question. Of the...

Essentially there are three incidents, the pale green to begin with, then the bright light that came at you from Ocala, and then the Miami-Palm Beach incident. In this whole thing, which all told must have last lasted, what nearly at hour?

Let's see. Yes, a little over an hour, I guess.

What impressed of the whole, total incident, what things stand out more in your mind now?

Well, mostly the obvious near collision. This was--all the rest of it you know. I could, I don't believe I would have even mentioned the rest of it if we hadn't had that one thing.

And the frightening thing waswhat it was not on Jacksonville, or no one else 'had it on radar. 

Well, I can accept this, because I know of too many cases where radar has been scrambled, even by our own devices.

Now, I don't feel that I will get anything more additional if I call Mr. Rushing...

Mr. I can assure you, you wouldn't.

because I fed, just from his remarks in the transcribed tape. I, when he mentioned he was ready to meet the Lord, I felt that he probably would be a little less than objective. I'd like to ask just for my own curiosity and not for the record at all, but you fly quite a bit, and obviously talk with other pilots. Have you ever had any stories like this, or UFO-type reports from other pilots when you talk among yourselves?

No, very...I don't ever remember another one from another pilot. I've talked to a number of people, maybe a half a dozen, who have obviously had UFO sightings of various kinds, but you never know, but most of these...

one was a housewife, one was my own brother-in-law who observed some objects over at Dallas some ten years ago. I guess, and they, of course, you know the few that you've read about in the papers. But, no, among other pilots, I don't right off hand recall may ever even having talked to any about them.

M.: This is every interesting because I have some reports from commercial pilots, but sometimes daytimes sightings, they've reported craft that come by and sort of "inspection" look, but very few, and those that I have talked with have been more reluctant to say anything, and definitely did not wish me to report it officially.

C Well, I don't blame them and I had gotten to the point where I was telling I couldn't stand discussing it, but the way it started we got too much information out and everybody started in.

H Well, it's an important, it may very well be a very important scientific and public problem.

You recall, one of things that did impress me, I don't know if it had anything to do with whatever, but you know they did lose their satellite shot early the next morning. And something went wrong with the data system. This could be coincidental, or what have you, or there may be those who don't want additional objects in space.

H: You know, it sometimes happens that, well let me ask you, did you find any of your instruments at all disturbed, or any compass, and so forth?

C No, nothing whatever. Everything was perfectly normal, half the radio wasn't working as usual, but everything was as normal as it had been before. No light change, no electrical change that I could notice.

H And did the light at any time leave any sort of a trail or exhaust?

C No, none whatever. I saw over Yuma, Arizona, one night that I was

going across there about 10,000 ft. in fact, I ended up landing there, because I was just worn out, but i began to suspect I was in I saw, now let me see. this was about 3 years ago, now I never investigated, but I think to this day, they were Marine jet fighters. I think there's a Marine base there, if I'm not mistaken. And they were doing similar looking acrobatics, going straight up, over the top, straight down, and then back up again. And there were two of them, one following the other, and I think it was jet now, like I say, I never asked. But this is the only thing similar to this I've ever seen. And these acrobatics, went for a total of how many minutes? G I'd say about 15 minutes. H And then, let me get the sequence straight, after that it went off to the east. G It went off just to our right. H Oh, you said, 15° angle up and disappeared in the sky, did it? C Well, it disappeared into the other stars. We couldn't identify it, it's a point where we couldn't identify it from the other stars in the sky. R Right, well, this has been extremely helpful; I wish I knew the answer to this. G Well, I'm afraid only the good Lord knows these, some of these answers. I believe there are things that we who are mortals on this earth don't know about, but I have accepted the fact that there are things going on that we can't comprehend with our finite minds and I, too, am ready to meet the Lord, but Mr. Rushing is an unusual person; like I say, I don't believe you would gain any information from calling him.

NO, I think I have. I think if I put you on a torture rack I couldn't get any more information. You've been very cooperative.
Can I get your name and where you are.
Sure, sure, it's a.Hyinek. I'm an astronomer here at Northwestern University and I've been a consultant to the Air Force on Project Bluebook for quite a few years.
You're at Northwestern, and where?
Evanston, Illinois.
Oh, in Evanston. We have a Northwestern University here, or maybe that's just Northwest at Wichita Falls. I'm not sure. Well, I'm very glad to give you any information I can, and if you should come up with anything interesting I would appreciate having a note from you.
All right, then let's make this a two-way street. If you wnated your flying saucer come across anything else, I'd appreciate hearing from you. I'm very easily reached, simply the Dept, of Astronomy, Northwestern University.
Sure, I'd be awfully glad to get in touch.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"and they seemed very sincere and a little bit shook up about the incident. They had it under observation for quite a long time and at one time they had two under observation; one went straight up and disappeared, the other one was out in front of them, bobbing and weaving around, changing altitude, setting motionless out in front of them; it was very off from them and so out a pretty good piece and stop. They had some passengers aboard but unfortunately, these people had their cabin lights on and were reading and weren't aware at the time of the object. Even down in the approach where I think they were at 3000 feet, they still had it in the approach area down at Palm Beach. We got some height finder readings on it; we had some printouts. I don't know if these were forwarded to Col. Quintanill or not. I think they were.

H Let's see. I can tell you; he sent me the whole dossier on it. First of all, here's the letter to me - it is reference the attached UFO report from Florida which occurred on 15 September 1968. Request you evaluate this case and make your comments on the attached Project Record Card. If you need additional information on the sighting, please obtain it. However, we want transcripts" etc. "Request this information on or before 30 November 1969." Then I have the regular Form 80-17 here, which isn't too helpful. There is some mixup on the radar it indicates they had some object following them, and yet the sightings all seem to have to do with things that were in front of them."

1.  At approximately 0052Z, 16 September 1968, Lt Colonel Crandall, Chief Intelligence Division, was informed by a call from the 306 Bomb Wing, Clovis AFB, New Mexico, that a G-string-clad William aircraft, S/N 53616, had reported a sighting of a UFO in the vicinity of Ocala, Florida.  Colonel Crandall was requested to release this information again for further investigation.  As this information did not meet the minimum criteria for unusual observation, Colonel Crandall was requested to discontinue any further investigative action on this matter.

2.  On 17 September 1968, Lt Colonel Crandall was contacted on the telephone by Captain Haibach of the USAF, SAGE Center, 32 Aer Division (SAGE). Captain Haibach stated he had some information on a ground UFO lighting at O52Z on 16 Sep 68.  The information, released by the 306 Bomb Wing, stated that this sighting and reporting was valid.  During the conversation it was determined that this was the same sighting and reporting referred to in paragraph 1 above.  Captain Haibach requested that Colonel Crandall furnish all information he might have on the sighting.  Captain Haibach stated that he had previously coordinated this information between the 20th Air Division Headquarters and others, and that Lt Colonel Crandall should be aware of it.  However, because the tape was practically inaudible on the telephone Colonel Crandall stated he would transcribe the conversation and send the transcript to Captain Haibach and this office.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from a document, likely a report, that describes a radar observation of a UFO incident near Ocala, Florida.

Transcription of the text:

"them. We didn't have any idea of what this could be so we tried to get them through center and they had already transferred over to the approach frequency, so we got ahold of approach control at Palm Beach and told them that this aircraft had sighted a UFO and asked them if they saw anything in the vicinity of the aircraft, and if so, what it was. They said they had nothing in sight. We asked the approach control man to have the aircraft turn 360 degrees, turn a circle, and observe in his rear position to see if there was anything near him. Approach told him to turn; he made a turn in the approach pattern, made a circular turn, and did observe the UFO out behind him. 

H So this then... would you then consider this a confirmed simultaneous visual-radar observation.  

** Yes sir, we had him on radar.

H So you had both and this object... when he saw him in front of him it was because he had made this circle.

** On the last contact. Now before, whever he was up higher in altitude-- I think it was around 9,000 feet--he had this UFO out in front of him, and it would go off to the side and set motionless; it would come straight in at him and veer off away from him; they said it was extremely high speed and changed altitude, and everything. After that they lost contact with him; they didn't see him anymore."

1. Jacksonville Center (ARTCC) Watch Supervisor (Mr. Craven) telephoned the Senior Director, 32nd Air Division (ADC), of a UFO sighting near Gainesville, Florida. The ARTCC Center had taken up contact with a twin Beech aircraft N631H that had reported a UFO. The pilot was Mr. Garland Trice. Telephone number, first sighting was 26 miles SE of Ocala City and last sighting was 22 miles northeast of Ocala City, Florida. Pilot observed the object for several lights, with no apparent change in shape or size. Object was doing aerobatics, changing attitudes rapidly, unusual during daylight hours and staying stationary for periods of time.

2. At one time, the pilot reported seeing two objects. One object disappeared.

3. On approach to Palm Beach, altitude 3500 feet, the pilot was requested to make a 360° turn to see if UFO was still with him. Pilot saw object at approximately 1000 feet, climbing at a rapid rate. Pilot observed off to the left.

4. Transcript of conversation with pilot is attached.

Garland, Texas - Telephone

First sighting was between Tyndall AFB and Cross City, Fla. 
Mr. _____ - A pale green light with intermittent flashes, a large light, much larger, or more like an airship because, only it wasn't nearly that green. It looked like something flickered in front of the light once every 3 seconds. Just a flicker. But we still thought it was a jet. It was doing something like that and then would go out of sight, and then you would see it coming back in from, occasionally veering off to one side and then to the other. We followed him until we were almost to Ocala, and he disappeared off into the sky on a heading of something like 220 degrees. When we got to Ocala, both of us were so apprehended over this that I would say he missed us about 3 mile. He came straight at us at an angle. We were about 15 miles out of Ocala, still on a heading of 120. This object came straight at us in a climb, and then went about 15 miles west of Ocala and just hung there at an altitude of, well we were at an altitude of 9000, I would guess that he was at probably 6000 or 7000 ft. 
We saw him move several times but when we last sighted him, it looked like he was sitting on the ground.
Capt Heinbach - We had a height finder on you and were tracking you and there was an object behind you for quite a while northwest of Palm Beach. I don't know exactly how far. We had numerous height finder checks on you; also an object much closer than I mile behind you.
Mr. _____ - We turned and saw what appeared to be the same white light as we saw previously. In a step burn, it seemed to jump like it disappeared rapidly. I would definitely not try to identify it.
Capt Heinbach - What do you think it was?
Mr. _____- I don't know. It was not a jet. Jet aircraft can't make the sharp turns these things were making.
Capt Heinbach - Everytime you saw it, it was making steep turns?
Mr. _____ - No, it would hover and then it would proceed on course exactly the same way we were going, ahead of us; then it would go straight up, over the top, or straight down.

Capt Heimbach - Was there turbulent or severe weather or lightning in the area.
Mr. --------- Lightning was off to the east from us. That is the reason we were turning to the south, down the eastern edge of the water zone instead of going on to Gross City. After the first object went off to the south, the 2nd object was almost in perfectly clear weather.
Capt Heimbach - Do you live in the Palm Beach area?
Mr. --------- No, I live in Garland, Texas.
Capt Heimbach - How long will you be in that area?
Mr. --------- We are leaving in the morning.
Mr. --------- Co-Pilot
This thing came at straight at us as it could come. I thought we were close to the warning zone (0x7d) and caused a little excitement. It was ready to pounce on us in a hurry. That thing looked like it was doing 2 to 3 thousand miles an hour. To the best of my judgement it would make complete left turns or right turns just about as fast as you could blink your eye. I have flown over 8000 hours in 3 years myself and there is not any jets that could fly like this. You don't have them that will go straight up and down like this was doing and then hover within seconds. Seems like it would put on brakes and then hover.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The image shows a typed text document describing a reported UFO sighting event.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

As I gather, the only thing he saw was a light, not an object.

Right, he saw the light. 

I've forgotten now what color he described that. Did he describe color or changes of color, do you recollect?

It seems that there wasn't too much shape to it; it was larger than a beacon light, or something like that. I don't remember now just what color, but it seems that possibly once he mentioned a different color, but normally it seems like it was a pale white light, I believe.

Now, let me get this sequence straight, and check me on this. Who saw what first? There are two avenues of approach here. They saw something and almost simultaneously, or a little before that, did the radar pickup something following them?

No sir. We didn't have any radar pickup until quite a way down in the sequence.

I see. The time-motion sequence, then....perhaps you'd better tell me. What happened first?

To the best I can remember, first of all, they contacted the people that were controlling them. That probably would have been Jacksonville Center or somewhere down in there.

- page 55 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Yes, because this report says Jacksonville Center, Mr. telephoned Senior Director (that is you)...

OK. Now the pilot had called Mr. and reported seeing the object. I don't know what the time lapse was, three or four minutes, when the second one appeared. And then the second one was under observation for a very short time and it went straight up and out of sight and there was no stabilizing on it. The other one, this one that they had closest and kept for a long time, was in fairly close to them occasionally and it would go off to the side and get motionless, and come out in front of them and dance around, bob around, and would go at about the same speed they were. Apparently this was there to five mile out, or so, and then they turned--they were, I think, going east at that time--and then they turned on a heading of about 150 to go down the peninsula of Florida. They continued to have observations of it on and off, and when they got under Miami Center Control they were still trailing it. They got on down and left Miami Center Control--this must have been 40 minutes or so later--and went over to the approach Control in the Palm Beach area and that is when we had radar pickup out of Patrick Air Force Base.

The radar pickup was out of Patrick, then. I didn't get that from before.

We didn't get any radar pickup from Cross City, Florida, or from Jacksonville, Florida. We never scrambled any aircraft to go out and try and get a visual on it.

On their approach to Palm Beach they were heading essentially south. As they continued southward, they were still seeing something in front of them apparently.

On their approach to Palm Beach they didn't see it for--I don't know how long a period--apparently they weren't bothered by it after they went over to approach control there at Palm Beach.

So then the second phase of this occurred after Control at Palm Beach notified them that something was following them. And then they made this 360 degree--yes, it says here, "On approach to Palm Beach, the pilot was required to make a 360 degree turn to see if the UFO was still with him." Then pilot saw object at approximately 1000 feet.

Yes sir, the best that we could ever determine it was.

And there was only one object at this time?

Right. Now, one other point, after he left Jacksonville Center Control and went to Miami Center Control, we requested Miami Center to give him position report and everything of his aircraft; and there were aircraft within two to five or two to ten.

mile from the aircraft--and Miami Center requested them to visually look in
the area where the aircraft was to see if they could see any lights or any
UFO or anything possible in altitude of around 5000 to 15000 feet; just
take a normal look up there and see if they could see anything, and I
imagine there were three to seven aircraft they requested to look out there
and none of them saw anything.

Now what does that really mean, I wonder, Here we had a radar return
and we had a visual sighting, and yet they were the only ones who made the
visual sighting.

It seems that if this thing was still in there view, that someone else
could not
see it. Now, we were never able to confirm the time or anything;
they didn't keep an accurate time of when it was harrassing them, or when it
disappeared, when it wasn't observed, or anything like that, so we don't
really know if these aircraft that were requested to look in that area would
have seen anything.

Now, the night was clear?

Yes sir. It was a very good night. There were a few lightening flashes,
I think, out to the southeast of them, over the central part of Florida.
This was the only thing that would have been interfered.

Now, the transcript of the tape--that was much earlier then. That
refers to the first sighting between Tyndall and Cross City, and that was,
waid you say, about half an hour before the radar incident?
